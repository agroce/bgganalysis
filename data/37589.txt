GAME: Clue: Discover the Secrets
RANK: 3912
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The new Intrigue cards and one time player powers add some subtle elements that I enjoy. The clock mechanism is interesting, but would be really frustrating if you managed to get the 8th clock right before trying to solve the game.

All in all, I think this is a great revision of Clue and recommend it over the classic version.

RATING: 5.9
2010-05-06 (rating 5.9):

I will not play this game unless strongly asked to. It is not interesting after few games when you realize what to ask for and how to record answers (including answers to questions of other players).

Then it just becomes pure luck in moves and cards you and your near opponents have.

Feels almost exactly the same as traditional Clue, but the added twists make a noble effort towards shortening the game.  They also did a decent job of fixing some of the problems players might have with the original game.  There still is a few disconnects between theme and gameplay, but I like all the added elements.  The special player powers are a fun addition, and the intrigue cards are priceless.  But the real twist comes with the clock cards that can eventually eliminate a player without them expecting it.  An excellent new twist on an old classic.

Slightly revised Clue.  The game timer (clock cards), 2 dice for movement, 1-time-use character actions, and "intrigue" cards (with special actions) are a nice touch.  It's still Clue, but it's much more tolerable and similar to designer/Euro deduction games.

UPDATE 2014:
My 2nd play (this time with 5p instead of 6p) was a lot less interesting and less fun.  Perhaps this game is best with 6p to really dilute the clue cards and make the game more challenging.  With 5p it was easy enough to solve the mystery in the allotted time and no players got killed, which decreased the tension and fun factor.

9 rating is for 4 or 5 players. The game does fall off pretty dramatically at 3 or 6 in my opinion, and is not recommended at all for those numbers.

Wow, I had forgotten that Clue is a pretty tricky game, deduction-wise. Actually trickier than Sleuth. Take a lot of notes.

The good about the new edition:
There is some clever endgame risk management. There is a deck of action cards to draw from, but as they exhaust, there comes the possibility of drawing a card that will kill you (the murderer run amok). So you have to sort of decide how you're doing in the game, whether it's worth the risk to draw a card, or not. This is actually rather clever and I like it. There is also some really good tension in the endgame. But if you don't like it, you can always play classic rules with this set.

The OK: The modernizing of the theme is OK. The action cards run from decent to modestly lame; not a lot of brainpower went into them.

The questionable: The player pieces aren't nearly distinctive enough (the clear plastic question marks with a colored base are lame). In general, the cards are murky, with wasted space and small, indistinct graphics. The physical design is in general mediocre, the only significant misfire in the recent round of Parker Brothers remakes (Clue, Risk, Monopoly Here And Now).

The ugly: If you were close and got unlucky in the endgame and got killed off, wow, that sucks. The timer of the clock cards is not very nuanced; roll a one-in-six on one of the dice late in the game and you have to draw a card, and may die, nothing you can do about it. And the clock isn't scaled at all for number of players (6 players seems like it would take longer). I'd much rather have a situation where the risks escalate or once the card deck runs out the clock runs much faster, instead of the existing coarse risks.

Like Monopoly, the box says up to 6 players, but there is no way this game should be played with 6. Consider 5 the absolute max.

Cluedo (that's what we call it) is my favourite classic game. The real flaw is the roll and move, but the deduction is fun.

This version sucks the awesomeness out a bit by trying to modernise the characters. They also have added bits to it but we usually just play it as regular Cluedo.

RATING: 7
Good version of classic Clue with a few tweaks here and there (intrigue cards, special power for each character ...).  Good game to introduce kids to deduction and to the art of the bluff.  Played with 3 - I suspect it would be better with more players.

A clasic game that I have played a lot and really enjoy. Today the game is a bit to basic for me, but I still like to play it on occasion.

Actually i think I enjoy the old version more because of this.

Les règles FR sont incompréhensibles, elles omettent des phrases et notions clés du jeu : du foutage de gueule pur et simple ! J'avais donc été très déçu.

Dans une pulsion de bonté immense, j'ai quand même donné une seconde chance à la dernière version de ce jeu qui a bercé mon enfance : j'ai eu raison ! 
En effet, j'ai traduit les règles américaines et les ai interprétées au mieux (en m'aidant du livret français merdique et des forums de BoardGameGeek) : j'ai enfin un fichier PDF de règles compréhensibles, cohérentes, qui respectent l'esprit du jeu et surtout qui ne laissent, je crois, plus de place aux situations litigieuses. 

Cette dernière mouture est bonne finalement quand on prend soin de jouer avec de bonnes règles ! 
Bon, OK il y a des jeux bien meilleurs que le Cluedo, mais les plus de trente ans ne peuvent être indifférents aux évolutions de cette licence légendaire du jeu de société. 

Finalement, je crois que je préfère un Cluedo 2008 aux règles parfaitement maîtrisées, simples et pas trop long qu'un Mystery Express frustrant, au matériel superbe certes mais où l'on se prend plus la tête sur les règles/mécanismes que sur la déduction et le bluff. 

J'ai mis mon fichier de règles en lien dans la section Files de BGG.
Toutes suggestions et critiques sont les bienvenues. 
Bon jeu !

There are 9 weapons now instead of 6. This adds some more deduction to the game--which is good. 

There is a 2nd die so that poor movement rolls are mitigated--which is good.

There is a deck of intrigue cards which give bonuses to players but also acts as a game clock--which is neither here nor there.

Otherwise this is classic Clue. It's going to see some game time at my house!

Nine weapons but a deck of cards to give you extra actions. Although, if you draw the 8th clock card you get murdered too! I suppose you could play without the cards for a slightly longer version of Cluedo. Weapon pieces are great, the player pieces not so, just pieces of clear plastic with question marks on. Pick up the DVD game if you want the best character pieces to add to a Cluedo game.

Nothing amazing, but not a bad little game.  It's been a while since I've played regular Clue, but from what I gather the timer speeds up the game a little bit, and is a fun mechanism.

Still, the roll and move aspect of the game is worthless and with good players will pretty much determine who wins the game.  I would still prefer a purer deduction game like Sleuth.

RATING: 7
I personally love Clue...  It isn't the hardest elimination game there is, but it's fun enough and a good time waster that's purely based on logic...  The dice roll is almost not needed in this game, but everyone loves to roll the dice...

This game does need a proper group to enjoy it fully though.  As there is no fun in losing...  Losing in this game usually leaves people dumb founded and turned off.  They can't figure out how you won, and they have no idea how to fix it...

I actually have a lot of fun teaching this game and how to win...  I actually just love logic...

To me this game can't fail, but this is a perfect example of how I rather have a game people like to play, than one I like but no one does...

I give it a 7 because it is a game I would seriously play when I know the group is right and it's asked for, but would not suggest it to many groups because I know the outcome of a bad experience thus making it an "anti-gateway" game.

After one or two games, you'll figure out most of the tricks. Usually everyone will deduct to the same conclusion in the same time or at most with 1 turn difference. So not much competition after the first several games.

Overall... they did a nice job on the re-invention of this game.  

One of the things I like THE BEST about the new rules is putting the extra "Rumor" cards in the pool room.  This assures that everyone always starts the game out with the same number of cards.  I always thought that was kind of cheap about the original game (when some players would start out with more cards than some others).  The Intrigue cards are a nice addition giving you some more abilities and also help in keeping the game moving along.  The Clock cards are also an interesting addition.

Probably most everyone would agree that the player "pieces" in the game could've been better.  At a time when even the basic game of Clue comes with player pieces that are detailed replicas of the people... all this game comes with is little plastic "Question Mark" pieces.

Still... for the most part, this game has more of what any Clue lover craves!!

Rating based on four plays so far with 3, 4 and 5 players.  It's Clue, but with special powers (not unbalanced), Intrigue cards, a more modern map, more weapons, and a chance for players to be killed if the game goes very long (more likely with more players).  I like it a lot, actually.  There is more potential for interesting play than in regular Clue, although you still have the chance to stumble almost randomly into the answers.  The Intrigue cards seem like they would add more randomness, but in actual play they have opened up more opportunities from what would have been wasted plays in regular Clue.  It has renewed my past love for the game from when I was a kid.  Really.

Good reinvent of the game.  I really like the new graphics, and the clock cards add a somewhat more interesting dynamic.  I'd need to play a bunch more times to see how the special characters turn out.  The rule where the extra cards go in the middle (the Pool) is great, so somebody doesn't get an unfair advantage.

I actually own the compact edition which I bought for only 6€ which is why I can definitely say that the game is worth its money. It's an interesting game where intuition can lead to your win - or to your loss if you miscalculate something. All in all the game is OK, not too intriguing nor too boring though it doesn't hit the tables as often anymore as it used to.

I don't know the other formats of clue but i feel this is pretty standard, and unlike what the other comments are saying. Thank goodness for the intrigue cards as they're the ones mixing up the game a bit and make it interesting. There are some plays a few people don't say eg calling out cards in your hand to make it seem as if they're part of the final answer, etc... The game is also simple and very light. I like it, though I wouldn't play it every week

Esentially this is like regular [i]Clue[/i], but it has two dice instead of one (which balances the dice rolls), once per game abilities for the characters, more weapons, a deck of randomly picked cards mainly with other special actions, but also with some clock cards, and the possibility of being killed by the assassin if you get the 8th of such clock cards. I like this changes for the better, even when there is really nothing that exciting to launch rockets. Nevertheless, I don't like the new modern feel of the game (I prefer the classic one of the original) and the changes in the characters background. Colonel Mustard is not a Colonel anymore, but a retired sport star, to give an example. Still, I'd say that if you don't own a copy of [i]Clue[/i], which is not a bad game, you probably should pick this one up instead, but if you do, stay with the original because the changes are not that big of a deal to own them both or to switch the old for the new one.

Cluedo is an oldie. However the new additions to rules, don't make the game better, but even less entertaining. Even the fact it's a classic does not raise its rank for me.

RATING: 7
I've always enjoyed this classic. The new rules very much improve the game.

Drawbacks:

-The new player pieces are horrible compared to the recent figurines
-Not the deepest of games
-Plenty of randomness involved

Wow, a fun mass market game!

It's Clue, but even better: there's time pressure now, because at some point the killer will begin killing off players! In fact, it's possible that no one wins if everyone gets killed!

--- Summary ---
I haven't played the base game since I was a kid, so can't compare the differences in detail. So to just summarize this game: players start in specified locations. Three clue cards (1 each weapons, locations, people) are set aside in envelope; the goal is to deduce which cards have been hidden. The rest of these cards are shuffled together and distributed amongst players (any remaining are placed face down in the poolroom).

On your turn, roll 2d6 and spend points to move around board. One of the d6 has a ? symbol: if rolled, or if you stop on a ? on the board, draw from the Intrigue deck (there are 8 timer cards shuffled in; whoever draws the last one is killed, then that card is shuffled back in!). If you're killed, reveal the 3 cards you were dealt initially.

If you end in a room, may start a rumor: name a person, place, and weapon. In clockwise order, players must either show you one of those cards from their hand (if they have any) or pass. Exception = poolroom: here, you may look at the face down cards (if any), or make your official guess. [b]If you guess correctly, you win the game[/b]! Otherwise, you may no longer win (but you still continue playing, as you may need to answer questions).

So luck based, perhaps even more than the original.  I still enjoy Clue, although I probably overrate it a point or two for the sake of nostalgia :)

RATING: 9
I wanna give it a 10 but since I just got it today so it's to early to say for sure that this will be the game that accompany me for the rest of my life.

Overall, this is a really mysterious but exciting game. A lot of interaction with other players, a lot of strategy involved. 

One tip here for playing strategy: You don't have to know everthing else before being certain about what tool/where/who is in the confidential envelope, observe what others do and mark on the notebook. This will help you for your next rumor.

Good theme play.  Game easy to learn and play.  Played the original version numerous times throughout the 1980's.  Only logged recent plays.  This version adds Intrigue Cards which give a temporary special ability.  Some other rules changes too, such as it is possible to die.  The changes add a level of complexity and make the game longer.  The components are above averge - colorful mounted board, plastic playing pieces, but very chinsy cards.  The rulebook is OK.

Praktycznie da się pograć w grę przy 4 osobach (nie mniej) a to pewna wada gdy nie mamy kompanów. Gra wymaga niezłego główkowania co jednym się spodoba a innych przyprawi o zawrót głowy. Z uwagi na tematykę nie polecam tej gry jako gry rodzinnej. Generalnie ok ale rzadko jest okazja by w nią pograć.

Better than original clue.  Has some interesting additions.  The clock and intrigue cards make for more player interaction.  It's too bad the artwork is so boring.  I much prefer playing Clue Master Detective.  I may combine the two and see how that works.

This is actually a game chest - it includes the new version of Cluedo, Monopoly (Global edition), Chess, Checkers, Cribbage and Dominoes.
In a large wooden case (the top is a reversible monopoly/cluedo board, the inside box is a chess board, everything for all teh games fits in a combination of draws and a tray insert in the lid).

Would trade for some fun and accesible family/filler games (e.g. Unspeakable Words, 12 Days, Once Upon A time)

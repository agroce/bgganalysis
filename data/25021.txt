Mahaffey did a fantastic job on the map, the game is really beautiful. This is one of the few games where I get that same tension as I do from Twilight Struggle in that I don't really know what the plans are (but I can deduce some of them from the board), but how the card play will spin out is another story. The crux of combat in that I need the blocks, and the cards to succeed makes for an interesting card counting exercise at times, but mostly is a "have I seen a ton of these? Ok, maybe I should assume that entering battle over here won't draw more out and plan accordingly." Really interesting tactical play in that regard to slather on top of the overarching strategy. That I can challenge loyalty and I need cards to go succeed in battle (not necessarily enter) is really an interesting idea, and I think that's what makes this game shine. Really close to an 8.

Rated it a 7 after initial play, if I played a few more times and understood some of the finer points of strategy I will probably rate it higher. Surprisingly static game play, which seems to fit the system and historical flavor well.

After second play I increased my rating to an 8. I enjoy the card play immensely, have a bad hand? Attack! This will deplete your cards and replace them with perhaps the kind you need. This system encourages aggressive play - really cool!

This will require more sessions to completely reveal its subtleties, but I will cite a few gripes.

First, it SEEMS that the game may have limited playability over time. The random draws which supplement each location's forces mitigates this somewhat, as do the cards, but I'm willing to overlook this as the number of times this will see the table should keep each play more than fresh.

Second, the blocks don't stack very well. This is kind of a problem with the requisite checking for castles, control of supply locations, etc. Minor niggle, yes... but still.

The card-driven battle mechanic and shedding of half of your leftover cards from turn to turn is novel.

RATING: 9
My currently favorite block game, and excellent production with a lot of meaningful choices. I hear how it is said that the choice of approach is rather limiting (due to tightness of the roads and the geographical importance of Sekigahara), but I have yet to see it affect the overall player's choices in a meaningful way. So as of now - solid 9.

Have had three great games against one of my regular group with this game. The last was I think the most tense game I was ever involved in. Huge depth and replay ability in a smartly written rule book. Easy to learn but hard to play well. Made me love the block.

RATING: 6.5
A few issues with this game (balance being probably the most important) but also some unique mechanics and beeatiful design/artowork (unfortunately the box is too small - no question about it), so maybe it deserves a 7...
Plays fairly quick.
Definitely recommended as an introductory wargame.

RATING: 8.5
A 2-player game that shines exceptionally well solitaire. Its victory conditions, clan artwork, blocks and "chrome" (do not read "complexity" here), all conspire to capture the mood and epoch that the designer attempts to bestow.

A game where the attacker may never know: who will be defending, whether the defender has the capability to react, whether attacking forces will remain true - or even whether future attacks will have the cards to run them - until it's all too late - merge with some of the most free-flowing game mechanics that I have ever seen.

With just one scenario and one set of victory conditions (kill certain blocks/discs, capture Castle Locations and Resource Locations) - the fact that no game session will ever start the same way twice (roughly 50% of on-map blocks, starting Reinforcements and each player's starting cards are generated randomly) - will provide this game's potential for longevity.

Whether gamers will eventually tire of this novelty as opposed to a title offering multiple options for play cannot be said - but for a new design with an exceptionally smooth engine, Sekigahara deserves to be praised for its contibution to fun gaming, interactive education and the hobby.

Very smooth asymmetric yet balanced game of clan warfare in feudal Japan. Love the chunky blocks (although stacked too high the topple too easily), the very tight card play driving movement and combat, and the feel of tactics and range of interesting conflicts during play. The rules are very well done with an excellent reference sheet - this game is easy enough that I think anyone could get into it (think Memoir 44 or 1775 Rebellion level complexity). Highly recommended for any light weight wargamer.

RATING: 6
A loosely card driven block war game with fog-of-war. Players aim to claim certain spots on the board and hold on to them until the game end while trying to avoid sudden death from losing their leader in battle. Controlling these spots also grants bonuses between rounds. To solve individual battles and to make the game less deterministic, a degree of uncertainty and speculation has been introduced in the format of hidden units and hidden cards. Every turn you have the same actions at your disposal but the randomly drawn cards determine the magnitude of operations. It can well be that you have a big pile of units stacked up in one place but are actually unable to command them due to lack of suitable cards. This is where tactics plays an important role, i.e., when to wait for a better hand and when to play aggressively. Pushing forward recklessly only results in shortage of cards which translates to you being unable to command your units.
 
Rules are written in GMT style being well structured and clear. However, there are some a bit fuzzy and easy to play wrong rules regarding who is the attacker in some cases (you are defending a castle of yours but because you mustered units in the region you suddenly became the attacker and are thus in disadvantage). Moreover, calculating the total impact of your forces can be a bit tricky due to certain bonuses that are not visualised on the components.
 
The game is quite slow paced. Building up momentum and moving units on the board is a slow process and on many rounds nothing spectacular happens. Once engaged in battle, you have to wait for reinforcements for a good while. If Sekigahara teaches you something, would that be patience and careful planning in advance. I am torn with my opinion about the game. On the other hand I like the careful tactical preparation during which players assume their positions before the dance, but it also means that a single battle can easily become decisive because it is very hard to recover when things go south. This is more realistic but when it comes to boardgames, you have to ask yourself whether you prefer a simulation or a fantasy. I could recommend the game with some reservations.

This game is gorgeous, which is quite surprising for a wargame (and for GMT, too), and that scores big points in my book. It's also very well-designed, with some great mechanics around the way armies can be deployed and used in battle.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A fantastic game that is not only balanced mechanically but thematically makes sense to even one who has read and watched many books and videos on Sekigahara and Japanese history (For Example, Armies refusing to be deployed in battle was a real problem to both lead Generals at the time). And also it plays in a reasonable amount of time and the rules are really short compared to most other wargames but its quality of play and fun is heads above most of its competition.
Downside is it is only 2 player and it is a limited scenrio of Sekigahara but the cards are different every game which changes how the goals are reached. 
In conclusion, a game not to be missed in my view as a game and for the stories it will tell.

RATING: 8
A simple and straight forward wargame with a semi unique combat system that mimics those used in Friedrich and Maria. Using cards and blocks now to account for suit compatability and thus produce the values ahead of your opponent.

The simple map with odd numbers of castles and resource points makes up the battle scenes. The limitation in point to point transverse makes it inevitable to confrontational combat.

The size of the battles are dependent on horde strategy or is forced by movement restrictions. The army size is thus limited which in turn limits the battle actions you can take or make. Be it a huge army or a small force, their ability is limited by card plays. However, if both sides have the average card draw, the group with the larger amount of blocks and/or mon, will tend to win.

Losers are punished with lesser presence on the map but is compensated with an extra card most of the time. Losing 2-3 combat consecutively will almost make catching up that much more difficult. Thus in this aspect, the game is unbalanced due to the luck of your draw and your loses.

Overall production of components are fantastic, but the size of the blocks make access to map information limited. 

A good introductory wargame that's last about 2-3 hours of game time.

Provisional rating after one play. It has a lot of really smart design decisions. The hand management is deeper than it first appears. It's probably better than an eight but it didn't quite grab me by the throat the way my nines did. It may yet.

update: Increased to nine after a second play. The endgame seems like it can get a little solveable but that's common enough in wargames that it doesn't bother me. I think the game system itself is a 10 but the fact that there's only one scenario with a mostly fixed setup means I wouldn't want to over-play it.

Difficult.
After the first play I really HATED the inability to use what troops I have available as I want. But maybe I played it wrong. I tried to force the game to run like I want.
In my second play I "swam" with my hand of cards. That worked out much better, even if it meant sometimes to change plans...

This game rocks! It is easy to learn, straightforward and fast paced. It is a perfect combination of strategic movements and card management. The reinforcement system works great. After each battle the player can replenish his cards hand and is thus given the chance of reorganizing his strategy. The blocks do not suffer step losses which makes it way more manageable than the majority of blocks game that you must constantly flip. Blocks are rectangular and can be easily stacked on each other and thus being constantly visible to the player. A really nice game!

RATING: 7
Elegant is not a word I'm accustomed to using about wargames, but Sekigahara is just that.  It effectively conveys a feel for its period of history with simple, well integrated mechanics.  I very much like the battle system, with blocks brought into action by the play of a matching card, rewards for a unified force, and uncertainty added by loyalty checks. Exposing a force to counter-attack when you don't have a fist full of the necessary cards can be costly.  Sekigahara takes the uncertainty of classic block games (how strong is that force?) and doubles it (how strong is that force and will it fight for him?).

A couple of things I'm less happy with.  Hand management is clearly vital and yet I didn't feel that I had very much control over it; battles of any scale and the obligatory discard of half your hand each turn result in in awful lot of card churn.  It often felt as though my hand was playing me.  Second, sieges that are guaranteed bloodless for the attacker seem downright peculiar.

The blocks and the board of Sekigahara are really quite gorgeous.   I would have appreciated a victory point track. The rules are an easy read.

* Japan ... I am fascinated by Japan and this era.
* Beautifully designed. Great to look at.

[u]Cons[/u]:
* No dice ... a centuries old mechanism to add unpredictability. Those cards ... I don't know .... too euroish.
* You draw cards a limited number of times. This can ruin things up for you, when you draw a bad hand.
* Combat System is too euroish ... not my cup of tea.
* If you play too many cards during combat you risk a loyalty challenge.
* Still a long game in spite of the limited number of turns.
* Bloodless sieges that can be executed immediately.
* Mixing different clans in one stacks is favorable. That is not in line with the historic reality.
* Exciting till the last turn? True, but then I am left with the feeling: Was this all there is!?

* I wish this was a Columbia Games blockgame.

Session 1:
A few rule mistakes aside, the session was remarkable and memorable. The session ended at the end of the 7th turn as both sides failed to kill opposing leaders. The game was decided on a Tokugawa attack in the 6th turn where the Tokugawa player played a Loyalty Challenge card just one step too early, losing the battle and losing two resource locations on the following turn, thanks to the gap created by their defeated army. Ishida victory by points.

Session 2:
Played with the same partner. We switched sides and I was Tokugawa this time. I was quite aggressive and I decided to move my leader close to Osaka. Too close, in fact, as an attack in turn 5 broke my 4-block defense in front of the castle which was housing Tokugawa and one more unit. I underestimated the opponent army's ability to defeat me in my castle but they succeeded on the next turn, thanks to three more Kobayakawa cards. Ishida victory by elimination.

Session 3:
Played with the same partner. I was Tokugawa again. Another aggressive game as I managed to take Kyoto on the end of 3rd week after a big battle which resulted in 3 casualties on my side and 5 casualties on the opposing side. My opponent hit back with an attack on Kiyosu with 4 blocks on the following week. I managed to do a counter-attack by moving my forces back from Kyoto and Gifu onwards to Kiyosu. His leader got trapped on Okazaki castle as he had nowhere else to retreat. At the end of the fourth week, I was able to kill his leader as well. Tokugawa victory by elimination.

Session 4:
Played with same partner. I was Ishida, and an early attack with the Tokugawa leader on Osaka by my opponent meant sudden death to him, especially since I had the right mixture of cards and was able to kill 6 blocks on one battle. Ishida victory by elimination.

Session 5:
First game with a new partner. I was Ishida. I was able to teach the rules in a short time and that's a nice thing. Lots of back and forth fights around Gifu, Kiyosu and Okazaki meant a lot of dead soldiers. The game came down to the last battle of the last turn. Tokugawa player spread out their soldiers efficiently to take control of the key locations on the battlefield. I was not able to draw the cards I've needed for the last battle to take control of a resource location. Tokugawa victory by points, 14-13.

After five plays, I can safely say that the block system, the simplicity of the game and the artwork together bring a great game to life. Although I fear the game might get repetitive after a while, let's say 10 games or so, it's too early to jump into conclusions and I still have at least a couple of years until I get 10 games under my belt. Solid game.

+ Looks absolutely gorgeous. Easy to explain and relatively quick play. Interesting mechanics.
- It sucks to play defensive. You get attacked on an army for which you have no cards? You'll probably lose the whole army. In sieges the attacker doesn't lose any pieces... I'm also worried about the fact that you seem to act with the armies the cards tell you to. Sure there's some hand management to do, but even so... Having to discard half of your hand kills a big part of that hand management. The box is too small. And it could have used some more chrome.

The production quality of the game is rock solid and the visual display of the game is outstanding.  It is a highly styled game that shows a degree of refinement.  How does the play match up?  Overall, not bad.  There is a degree of luck in the block draws and there are definitely times when certain actions will see better outcomes.  The only unknown in the game for me is balance.  It's not entirely clear if the 2 sides are well balanced or not.  This could be the result the strategies employed or the strategies could be the result of the asymmetric game setup.  Its a game that begs to be explored to find the answer to these questions and that makes it a worthy game to play.

Preliminary rating after 1 play.

Light (as in rules complexity and play time) wargame. Extremely tense, the traditional fog of war of the blocks and cards means you don't know what your opponent has; additionally the loyalty challenge mechanism means you often aren't even sure how strong your own forces are. Lots of agonizing over what to do, and the overall situation is always fluid and uncertain. 

A few more comments: I'm not concerned about the start of the game getting stale, as your initial moves feel  highly dependent on your card hand. I'm more concerned about the middle game, with Tokugawa consolidating in the west and Ishida in the east for a big clash in the middle (near, say, Sekigahara...). This is also one of the few games I think is completely imnpossible to play solitaire, too much depends on the fog of war. 

Finally, the only large-ish flaw I found so far, once your opponent has played all his loyalty challenge cards, you can feel safe until he reshuffles the deck; at least so far, the threat of a loyalty challenge often feels more powerful than the challenge itself. The obvious solution is to always keep the last one in your hand, but it's a cumbersome limitation on an otherwise elegant design.

I think the final rating will be determined by how much you can control all the uncertainty, but so far it looks good.

RATING: 8
I'm going to have to start down-modding my ratings of block wargames, because every single one I play I end up loving. I think this might just be my favorite genre.

Sekigahara builds on Hammer of the Scots and Julius Caesar, with a different combat mechanic. In this combat mechanic, the troops you can use in battle are based on the cards in your hand, but you also have to discard cards in order to move and muster.

It does feel very different from HotS and JC, and I want to play it about 5 more times to really get a handle on the strategy behind it, but there are one or two things that don't sit entirely well with me:

First, is how the cards mesh historically with the swaying of troops. So, the idea is that you can only activate certain blocks by playing cards out of your hand that match those blocks. To me, this does a good job of representing the loyalty of those troops - the problem is, there's then a "gotcha" card that calls into question the loyalty. This MIGHT introduce just a LITTLE too much randomness into the game, whereas in HOTS and JC, you can make an educated guess on who will win a battle prior to going into it, but still be surprised.

The other thing is, that's the only "gotcha" you've got in the game. HOTS and JC both make use of thematic cards that play into how you shape your strategy. I like that.

Finally, there's movement: now, perhaps it's just because I didn't ENTIRELY grok the movement while we were playing, but it felt a little clunky: You have to reveal a leader to move farther, and your movement is based on the kind of roads, and the number of blocks you're moving, etc. It's also point-to-point movement (I much prefer Hammer of the Scots with this, as it's much easier on the eyes).

Of course, I'm splitting hairs here. This is an amazing game. Also, GMT published it with a mounted map board, which already gives it a leg up on the other two block wargames. Any game I have to nitpick this much to find something wrong with it, is an amazing game.

I've played this twice and it's not bad. The combat system is interesting, but I suspect it depends too much on lucky card draws ... if you have two battles in one turn you are really hoping that your first battle lets you draw cards for the second one. Given only 7 turns, that's a lot of uncertainty, so a lot of your battle moves are going to be bluffs or semi-bluffs. 

So, amusing but not necessarily deep.

Sekigahara is a masterpiece in wargame design. Its simple rules are the result of a perfect blend of theme integration and historical accuracy (the outcome of the war was largely a matter of honor and loyalty, rather than strategy and tactics), and wonderfully manage to provide a play experience, as well as an aesthetics experience.

Sekigahara thrives on lots of tough decisions, with players constantly evaluating various types of trade-offs: between potentially super-powerful mono-daymio armies and reliable and flexible differentiated armies, between the necessity to deploy in battle the most powerful blocks and the inevitable outcome of losing some of them, between the necessity to form a powerful hand and the need to discard for moving faster with many stacks‚Ä¶ and so on!

I was really blown out by the first play: tentative rating is 8.5‚Ä¶
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Initial Impression: This is a highly thematic, elegant game that is simple to explain and play but has some tough and interesting choices. Cards are a resource used for troop movement, reinforcement, and combat. The combat mechanism is unique. I highly enjoy playing this game and it's probably my favorite game of 2011. 

10 Plays: I'm still enjoying this game. Despite the fixed starting locations, the game still feels fresh and open-ended. The tension of hand management remains present throughout the game. The easy ruleset has allowed me to teach the game to a number of people. Game balance is also not an issue.

The rules in Sekigahara are simple and elegant. The game offers difficult decisions at every turn(something that many games strive to do that few accomplish effectively).  The combat system is tense and flat-out-fun (it has a similar feel to the card battles in Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage) and it can be played a couple of times in a single evening.  Sekigahara is a winner.

Ordered this game 4 years before it finally got realeased through the P500 system. But boy was it worth the wait. This low complexity wargame is easy to learn and relatively quick to play. Gameplay is straight forward and fluent which keeps the game moving. Despite it's low complexity it has enough interesting tactical decision making to keep even the most hardcore gamer engaged. Hand management is of the utmost importance. Cards are needed for everything in this game and you will face some real tough choices with regards to card use. The combat system feels tense and authentic in both small skirmishes and massive battles. The theme feels very much present despite the fairly abstracted mechanics. The beautiful map and blocks really help with this. This is an absolute top product and a must try for anyone interested in a short but very engaging wargame.

RATING: 10
Pro's:

1) Great complexity to playability ratio. The game is very playable and I do not think it punishes you too heavily for being relatively new at it.
2) The block war game system mixed with the style of combat makes for absolutely epic battles. Even the small skirmishes on the map can be really tense as it is not always easy to tell what cards your opponent actually has.
3) Beautiful components, the blocks themselves are really unique with their shape comparing to other block war-games and just feel fantastic to move and play with. Map is excellent.
4) My second play through was a lot more strategic than the first, I think the game will open up more and more, it has the potential for some really subtle play.

Con's:

1) My only real gripe is that the large block stacks become hard to move and they block parts of the map that are useful to see.

Good game.

RATING: 9
Quite a unique and beautiful game. At first it would seem that there are not a lot of options available and, thus, replay ability would be low. Although certainly no expert, I think that there are several options to pursue for each side which, combined with the randomness of the card draw, makes for many possible situations. Especially when bluff come into play, which I suspect is an important aspect to good play.

Several playings have left me with the very unusual situation of not being able to analyze just what I have learned from the experience, With other (more traditional) games this was always possible generally speaking. Sure, I have been able to learn some lessons from each play, but there remains this opaque cloud that I cannot penetrate.

Then it hit me...it is the aspect of bluff that I am not grasping. I am not a poker player and have limited experience with games where that concept plays an important role. Without that, I strongly suspect that is what I am not seeing and which, as a result, comprises my opaque analysis denying cloud.

Regardless, I am enjoying it. A lot. Plays in 2.5 hours via VASSAL/Skype, so knock 15-30 minutes off that FtF. I always leave the table with a smile on my face. Oh, and scratching my head.

Hugely impressed by this. See my review here for details.
---
Second play saw Tokugawa getting hammered, so I'm less concerned about any balance issues now :) Just don't be shy about bringing in those Mori big guns. A lot of the Ishida deck is Mori, so if you don't bring the blocks in you'll have a significant card-efficiency problem. Still quite drawn to this one.
---
Just one play, so this is an initial impressions rating, but (with one caveat) I was really impressed with this. Fast-moving, totally manageable complexity, with a great and tense battle system, lots of high-stakes decisions, interesting card-management, and authentic theme, this really feels like a winner.

The caveat is that we'll have to keep an eye on balance. Tokugawa won handily in our game despite major reverses on the battlefield, and he does start with a substantial point advantage due to all his castles and the vulnerable and strung-out Ishida forces to the east. One game is hardly conclusive - I think the Ishida need to be aggressive about bringing in the Mori blocks, which they were not in this game - but still, some risk there I think.

I don't think it's quite as "innovative" as all that - this is clearly building on groundwork laid by Columbia block games, Napoleon's Triumph, and Hannibal - but innovation is overrated. Being good is better than being innovative.

Was able to get in a playtest session at GMT West Weekend. Block game using cards for combat - the mechanics for which are reminiscent of Friedrich, which I very much enjoy. Quite a simple, elegant system with clean and functional components. I felt that there may be a bit of a runaway leader problem but since the game is still in development hopefully I was either mistaken or that issue will be ironed out before publication.

Relatively simple block wargame with interesting use of clan cards to activate units during a battle - a little bit like Friedrich. The loyalty cards are quite fun (for the winner). Fairly fast playing as there are only 14 turns. Different markers for the castles and resourse points would have been helpful as the blocks cover up the all important information.

RATING: 8
Awesome. Obsiously fantastic card system. 
Japanese esthtetics respected ! 
GMT's artworks seem to become even better these days. Thumbs up !
Ishida don't stand a chance. 
He was a prick anyway.

Attacked him in my first game dealing 48 loses points through a massive cavalry charge (luck + minimal strategy). The maximum on the scale. Takeda revival!
I've rarely seen my friend game designer Alexandre Groppi in such a terrible mood.

Played twice, won't play it much again, just because of the complete lack of balance in victory conditions. If I want to do 1-10 odds, I prefer playing SPQR than this awesome game. The card system will live on though. Hope we get 10 other titles on the period with this mechanics.

Rated 9 after a learning play and an actual play. This delivered exactly as I had hoped. Conflict of Heroes was my first proper foray into wargaming, and perusing lists of "great introductory wargames" led me to this title. I like the idea of hidden block games, and after two plays, I'm pleased I picked this one up.

The rules are harder not really harder than, say, Commands and Colors or Battlelore with a few expansions. Conflict of Heroes has a denser set of rules. The game delivers a combination of hand management, maneuver and bluff. it is easily playable in three hours. And I suspect there is enough variety in setup and strategy to keep me coming back for more.

I might not need to own many "proper" wargames, but this is likely to stay on that short list.

RATING: 8
I have now owned the game for over 2 years and have only just been able to play it, but I was blown away by how much fun it was.  It really felt brutal to have to spend cards to move armies and be counter-attacked, but then those battles happen with such wonderful surprises, that maneuver happens that there was no way he had the cards for, and the game is fresh every turn.

0.25 mark is deducted because of the game balancing and the blind draw of the replenishment.  Another 0.25 mark is deducted because the blocks always block the way to see the icons on map.

Starts with a 7 that is likely to rise. It seems like there are a lot of different pieces - hand management, tactical movement, mustering, bluffing, etc. - that should come together in a pretty cool game. First play was really just a learning game, and I just started scratching the surface.

RATING: 8
Very innovative light wargame based on historical campaign in feudal Japan in year 1600 which produces a more than 200 hundred years hegemony of Tokugawa family. 
Simply rules, simply as Columbia Games block games rules, very easy to learn.
Main core of mechanics creates of unpredictability on enemy forces (using of blocks) and getting those into the battle (cards which deploys forces to fight). All in all that produces fine mix of poker and chess tension and tactics. 
Design very elegant and readable. 
After more than dozen plays - very good wargame, similar abstractions as in Maria, Friedrich or Napoleon's Triumph but very playable. Sekigahara is less deeper than those games, but still has some replay value thanks to card and block draw. Much luck dependant, especially in second half of the game (deck is redraw only once, and at least half of cards we use only once in a game). 
Tokugawa can make more mistakes, Ishida play must be optimal and very well conceived.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
:tobacco: :( :D My initial comparison to Maria was not inapt -- this game is pretty easy to explain (for a wargame) to experienced gamers, plays quick (for a wargame), manages to squeeze a lot of historical chrome out of a straightforward rule set, and has a lovely, well-produced collection of board, card and bits. As a rule, games that resolve battle via a card-play minigame (as opposed to, say, dice) tend to be a disappointing tradeoff of time and busywork over additional strategic interest. Sekigahara is a glorious exception to this rule -- the play of battle cards is its own bit of bluff and counter-bluff.

The long-term concern, perhaps, is that the high degree of tactical intrigue will be dragged down by strategic-level sameyness, which is a common problem with wargames covering a single battle or geographically constrained campaign. So far it hasn't been an issue and, frankly, until I get a regular opponent for two-player games, I'm not sure the game will get to the table often enough for this to be an issue.

Smart design, fast to play, superlative components, full of choices: really a masterpiece.

10/jan/2014 update: I keep thinking the above, but, to be honest and fair, I have to downgrade my rating. Why? Simply because I see that, in my current shortage of time to spend in the hobby, when it comes to choose the casual play, I consider this game but, then, I resolve to turn to a more grognard-wise title. 

30/jan/2014 - Played again; lost with Tokugawa. Tough game! Really hard to choose what to do with the cards (keep, discard to move, discard to force march) and with troops.

Just after one play, where as Ishida I took too big of a risk and lost early. The game is unlike any other wargame I have played. It has its own tempo and finesse and felt more like a puzzle to me this first time. 

In a counterintuitive way, one needs to hedge ones bets by dispersing same mon units among various stacks to account for the card draw. Still, this might be a wrong strategy, since I have only played it once.

Would love to play it again, in order to recognise must have moves and what to aim for.

at first there are the long stretches of sipping tea and calmly strategising, but the nature of the game really encourages you to take risks and attack more as it goes on. and even when things are looking desperate as fuck you've still got to stay composed and impassive like a proper samurai, lest your opponent sees through your bluff

and it ends with an ACTUAL EPIC CLIMACTIC BATTLE

This isn't high on my want list, the thing it has going for it, it's a 2 player game. This game just seems to lack enough control.

Maria by Histogame is the better game of this ilk. But it is a 3 player game, publisher has good supply, but hard to find in US as it is a niche game, retailers reluctant to import, play is much longer. 

The lack of availability I think keeps its rating down from StUoJ. I like that Maria's suits on the cards are mapped, tied to, square areas on the map for play, vs StUoJ suits are mapped to the blocks themselves, cards held in Maria are unlimited, multi use, more to the game, including politics, 2 hussars to deal with, force marches, retreating of your army by your opponent's will when you lose a conflict, imperial election, a needed supply train to support the generals, not so in StUoJ. 

The politics and election is what ups the long time play. The shorter time play and being 2 players is the main advantage StUoJ has, Maria is just the better game, but finding 2 other players is problematic, two player games of Maria just falls boringly flat.

Still, for a game board player, not interested in hard core war games, both are a good picks. Hard core war gamers will be turned off by both, they need their dice, which both of these lack.

Maria is worth getting if you don't get gouged on price, try Boardgamebliss, they import Eruos, shipping cost to US is very affordable, unlike many Canadian sites. 

The short game sucks, find and download the PDF expansion, there is an in between length game option. Also get the updated rules.

Gem of a war game, simple, themic, battles with units eliminated and Not! coming back on the board the next turn.

Well balanced, many difficult decisions but not so difficult that they stall the game.

No die rolling, which speeds up the battles but definitely plenty of surprises and epic victories.

You can win unexpectedly or go for a few hours of grinding down your opponent, unpredictable.

Sekigahara is a game that both employs the best elements of conventional block wargames, and introduces new elements that capture the feel of conflict in feudal Japan.  Those new elements lift the game to a special level - the multiple abilities of the clan leaders, the card play during diceless combat, the initiative and impact systems, the forced march and special units, the intimate confines of the board scaled just right.  All of it add up to a game that could easily become a classic.

OK - this is one game I'm really glad I splurged on.  The map is simple but elegant and the wood blocks make me feel like I'm playing an ancient game and make the pieces easy to handle.  I like the hidden unit aspect of the conflict and the way the historic aspects are represented in the mechanics of the game.  The game plays quite different for each side so there is lots of variety.  The game is quite tactical in the sense you need to make the most of the deployment cards you have but there is strategic choices in how you group and move your forces.  Really enjoy this one and don't see that changing....

13-7-14 great battle between Al and myself. What a great game, tense and nervous can,t relax as Talking Heads would say. Right from the word go you are torn, to little cards to  many demanding options.

RATING: 4
Interesting game at first, but repeated plays seem to show that there are only a handful of viable paths to victory.

The resource spaces should be spread out more to encourage smaller armies to move around on the board.

The game also is pretty shallow history-wise.  Most of the clans are abstracted down to four per side, there are no weather effects at all, no events at all, cav and muskets are identical, no politics at all.  

The unit loyalty system is just gamey and not accurate.  A block will switch side for just a single battle, then either die or come back to its owner.  In history, the entire clan switched sides or stayed neutral, for the rest of the war.

Overall a piss poor wargame, but an ok game.

Full disclosure: I was a playtester for this game, and am a good friend of the desgner.

I have always liked the concept of fog of war block games, but have found them to be oddly lacking (with the exceptions of Napoleon and WestFront).  This game spices up the block game genre by adding an added level of fog.  Sure, your opponent doesn't know what troops you have, but likewise you yourself have only limited control over which of the troops you have will be willing to fight for you on any given turn.  This adds a very difficult and, to me, satisfying element of hand management to the game.  Filtering your hand so that you can motivate mixed armies in the short term while simultaneously engineering your hand to match the forces available in your primary army in anticipation for an epic smackdown is really very tough, but also very satisfying.

RATING: 6
Block wargame yet different enough from the Colombia block wargames to make it interesting. There is only one health level of each block so you don't rotate them at all. Combat is entirely different, where you play "suits" of cards to assist a specific unit. It's similar to Maria, except that instead of the suit matching a location on the map, it matches a unit type. But, there is a different hand management aspect, as you are forced to discard half your hand at the beginning of each turn. 

This game is probably not great for hard-core grognards, as it's pretty abstract. I like the chess-like feel to it. It's open, but not too much so that you are paralyzed with options.

Currently learning the game on Yucata and stickering my own copy for future FtF play. (This is the first block game I've owned; stickering is a definite pain in the ass.) The game is bleeping beautiful and the rules are concise and sensible with only a few (well-marked) exceptions. I think having just learned Azul made the combat system especially grokable. I'm *very* favorably impressed thus far; here's hoping it holds up over multiple plays.

I consider it a privelage to have been one of the playtesters for this title and I must say that it is a very elegant and intriguing game. It feels innovative, without adding complexity to a typical block game. Commanders are very important, as was the case historically. Some really tough decisions arise, from turn to turn, and varied strategies abound. Your holdings dictate your card hand, so players have to repeatedly judge the risk vs. reward for each potential attack. The design is elegant and it models the time period quite well, in my opinion. The map and components are absolutely beautiful, which adds to the game's thematic appeal.

Last week we played for the first time. Rule is simple but also sophisticated. After few rounds of playing, the process was more and more smooth. The combat system is elegant and full of uncertainty, It's very exciting every time. The components are solid and beautiful, but I think the Surrounding area of Osaka is a little bit Crowded.

Conclusion: Well-designed game.

RATING: 7
Sekigahara is rather unique as far as wargames (I have played) go in that it focuses far more on loyalty and alliegence then it does any particular subtlties of unit strength or battlefields. What results is some tight, interesting gameplay where you never quite know how effective your opponent's unit group will be. A giant stack could end up being a paper tiger, and a smaller one could end up being quite destructive. 

I like Sekigahara, but there is something about it that prevents me from loving it.It may simply be too abstract for my tastes, or the limited scope of the conflict might prevent me from feeling a sense of the sort of epic clashes that I frequently enjoy in wargames such as this. Still, it is quite enjoyable.

Players are opposing sides in the 16th century civil war for the Japanese throne.  Simple, easy to access block wargame, where players take two move/combat actions each oper turn over seven turns.  The game reminds me a lot of Napoleon, with blocks moving down a tight road network, and into battle.  Cards are used to pay for extra moves, faster moves, and activating units in combat - so you can never have enough of them. I enjoyed this game a lot.  The rules are very straight forward and easy to pick up, meaning you can concentrate on the strategy and not the rulebook.  The blocks and card play make combat incredibly tense and high risk. Very well done.  The blocks are gorgeous, the rules superb, the mounted map nice, but a bit muddy graphically.  Well worth a look.

This game alone makes me hate the fact that I am in a two player game void right now. There are others but this is one game that I want to learn, want to immerse myself with, I want to master. I want to find an opponent that wants to equal my level of involvement and learning of the game. I love the production, graphics and rules because they all have a simple elegance to them so evocative of Japanese culture. Just an amazing game that I see on my shelf and it gets me depressed slightly that I'm not playing. Yes, I could probably find games easier in a digital format but not using those block, not having the physical aesthetic in front of me...Not something I am interested in.

RATING: 9
Beautifuly produced, accessible yet deep wargame. Cards being used as tokens of clan loyalty to initiate combat, movement and reinforcements on the board is both highly thematic as well as deliciously interesting. You do feel like the commander of a vast army. Win conditions being to either destroy key personnel for instant victory or control the castles/resource locations at the end whilst also trying to manage your hand of cards makes for a brilliant dance of to-ing and fro-ing between you and your opponent as you decide when to advance. Hidden information in your opponents hand of cards and the blocks of units at their disposal makes for so much suspense. In my experience, games are won and lost based on dramatic moments, victory is always balanced on a knife edge. Only small complaint is that the blocks take up quite a bit of space on the board and can obstruct your view of the roads or other iconography. They can also be prone to tipping over if your not careful with how you stack them.

I love this game. The art and components are beautiful. The game design is a masterclass in minimalist elegance. Even the box is gorgeous, in a really understated way, and totally distinct from anything else on my games shelf. The way that the theme is expressed through the mechanics, leading to near recreations of the historical events without forcing the players to do anything, just staggers me. My only minor complaint is the lack of castle pieces. But like many others I got some suitable bits online and am now entirely content - and ready to die for my daimyo! Unless you have a loyalty challenge card tucked up your sleeve...

If you buy one two player war game. Buy this one.

It has the best component production values of any game i've seen. It makes you feel like a Diamyo fielding his forces.
The mechanics tie to the history, and they are simple, easy to learn and teach. It plays in under 2 hours, can go under 1 hour if some one wins before the last turn. It feels balanced and is very dynamic. I've got about 10 plays down atm, and feel a long way from done.

This is the war game i will measure all others by.

The only down side is its shortness, so you don't quite get that epic struggle feel like you do in Hannibal Rome V Carthage

It's been a year with Sekigahara and it is my first and only 10.  I figure there should be a lot more said about it than what I said above.  Each time I revisit this game, it just gets better and better.

Now let me state that 10 does not mean 'perfect game'.  No such thing.  Nor is it an 'always want to play' game, either, because I am a man who very much enjoys variety.  However, it is a game that I am more than happy to revisit again and again.  It never fails to please.

When I mentioned a year ago that this game features swings of luck, that is only somewhat true.  Proper hand management can and does mitigate a lot of the luck of the card draw, but at the same time, what makes this game so playable and exciting is that you will often find yourself gambling on an outcome, perhaps fighting one battle to burn enough cards to hopefully win a second.

There is a built-in risk/reward to every action you can take in this game.  Play it safe and you'll find yourself falling behind in the points race.  Be daring and you might just lose a key force in your strategy.

It is an absolute shame that Calkins has not designed any further titles because there is nothing short of genius in this game.  Sure, it may not be a chromey mess of exceptions upon exceptions, but that's what makes it wonderful.  It very simply captures the volatile loyalty of the clan and the random element of the card draw also reflects the varied effectiveness of the gathered forces.

Sekigahara and the battles/politics surrounding it where, in short, a cluster**** of a mess, and the game itself captures this perfectly.  There are other treatments on the subject that are a lot more detailed and chrome-laden, and while those titles are enjoyable, they seem irrelevant.  You can heap all the chrome you want onto a game, but you end up with a scripted experience.

Calkin's design, on the other hand, allows for history to change, and it has multiple times in my plays of this game.  What's amazing is that though either side can win, it has always been a close game in the points race.  The alternate win conditions of killing the opponent's leader(s) makes being bold a gamble; sure, send Tokugawa out - he's powerful and his clan members are numerous... but if he dies, so ends your game.  But what fun it is to gamble!

Through its card mechanics and replenishment rules, what you ultimately get is a fun block game that is very easy to get into, provides hours of fun, tense moments, and painstaking decisions to make.

I swear to you now, no other game will get a 10 from me.

I have no idea why I don't like this game more than I do. It has great production value, interesting topic and a very clever combat system without any dice. I can see the beauty of the design but somehow it fails to excite me when I play it. I rather play Hammer or Julius Caesar. 

Still, if you looking for a light wargame that can be played in a few houres... I would recommend this although my rating would suggest different

I'm surprised this is popular with wargamers, who are clearly easily distracted by pretty playing pieces and period map art.  This is euro-strategy all the way, a very abstracted hand management game that provides a lot of agonizingly tough decision points.

After one play but this game really impressed me. 

I was able to read the rules while my girl friend stickered the blocks. We then played a more or less complete game in under three hours while referencing the rules - neither of us are "experienced" wargamers. In the future I can't imagine this game taking longer than 2 hours. 

Many very fundamental wargame concepts are introduced and simplified in this game. I always find siege rules tiresome but this game made them very easy to understand. The battle mechanic was awesome and sort of felt like a game of cribbage or war. We were able to count up the impact totals easily after a sample battle before the game started.

The game itself looked awesome and was our introduction to block wargaming. Although, I would suggest this as a starting point for any war game that has movement.

This game just feels like putting your balls in a vise.  After a second play I'm starting to appreciate it more than at first. Mostly because, unlike a lot of block games, I feel like you can make moves that are clearly good for you rather than a series of a calculated gambles.  The flipside of the coin is that your opponent can too, so you just trade back and forth pummeling each other until one of you gets desperate enough to bring your leader into the fight and either the tide is turned or you get an auto win.  The greatest subtlety in the game seems to surround how the gold player brings in Mori.  I could make a case for early, late, or not at all at this point.

Quite possibly one of the best wargames I have ever played, Sekigahara integrated 'fog of war'-style combat and card play in such a smart, epic, streamlined way. It's truly amazing how the designer was able to put this together without it feeling overbearing. Every move is tense but workable, every decision feels heavy and yet it isn't heavy to play. Just marvelous stuff here. Replayability comes from random card draws and random unit draws, but the game offers so much kickback to the players that the random aspect never, ever feels like it's controlling the game, unlike C&C which sometimes hits you hard depending on which cards have been pulled. A mis-step in the game may be your undoing (as it was mine) but it feels so historically epic, you just want to pull it out again and try a different approach. A tight game too, everything is so crucial, but fun to play. Good work Matt Calkins on a brilliant design.  If there is anything aggravating, it is the lack of a VP at-state track for castles and resource locations.  Also, 3D castle pieces are sorely needed as they get easily buried under the blocks.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Sekigahara is a fastpaced blockgame once you learn the rules which are not very complex. The only real issue we encountered was how and when to use loyaltycards. A game is played over 7 turns and can be completed in 2 hours. Setup is pretty similar from game to game and time will tell if the game has enough variety to last in the long run. We had a great time yesterday though!

RATING: 10
Perfect mold that blends sparring of the minds along with clever strategic card play, bluffing, with a dash of luck. The aesthetics, gameplay, & theme combine perfectly to simulate an abstract experience of controlling Japanese armies during the Tokugawa period. The game is a breeze to understand, and play is quick. It's a wonder to behold when the pieces are stacked on the board while moving around. Although movement is restricted to moving around certain roads, I feel that it doesn't hinder gameplay (as some suggest), but rather leads to a need for quick adaptation strategy of outguessing & outmaneuvering your opponent, which also brings a Chess-like element to the game.

A block war game with Hidden troop composition. This is all about bluffing, compose an army (stack of blocks) that causes your opponent to be weary, even if you don't have the cards (command) to use them! You'll be paranoid the whole time....
I feel it's lacking in long term strategy options though. The board is very tight like A Few Acres of Snow, but you win by killing off particular units (I'm not sure why any commander would do anything but hole up at their home base...those commanders don't offer much of a bonus as part of an army, why risk that?) or controlling castles/resource towns by the end of the last turn (about 14).
As Tokugawa, with a fortified Ishida opponent, I felt like all I could really do was feign that I was going to attack my enemies highly defended (stack of 12 blocks) hq...while I spread smaller groups up to claim castles/resource spots and wait it out. I also felt outnumbered...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I very much enjoyed this title. The combat mechanism is an interesting one and adds to the hidden information and complexity of decisions. At the core of this game is a hand management mechanism. The number of units is important but without the right card combinations, they are worthless. An ominous stack of units can be harmless if their controller does not manage his hand properly.

My concern is largely about replayability. If the combat mechanic stays interesting I can see the game being fun after repeat plays. The set up is very interesting, there is a lot of variability in what a player can try to accomplish, where to push offensively, and where to defend and make a stand. The mechanics are low in complexity but that is necessarily a bad thing because I can tell there was a lot of thought put into maximizing strategic decisions while minimizing the rule set.  Overall I want to play again and I'm considering grabbing a copy for myself.

Asymmetrical, card-driven, block war game with opportunities to get your opponents troops to flip sides. Very much looking forward to playing this more.

PROS
-Art is lovely and components feel high quality.
-Card mechanics are simple and smooth.
-Despite having asymmetrical positions and win conditions, the sides feel balanced.
-There's a bit of a push-your-advantage element that, when paired with the Loyalty Challenge cards, creates some seriously palpable tension.

CONS
-Specialty card art is a sword and specialty block art is either a gun or cavalry.

PLAYERS BEWARE
-A few little rules that can make or break strategy really need to be hammered home. Although not difficult to understand, both players really need to read the rule book before starting.
-Movement might be the trickiest part of the game and players need to understand this going in.
-Can be very frustrating watching your forces being destroyed because you don't 
have the faction cards you need.

Admirably restrained design -- there must have been significant temptation to encumber this game with lots of little bits of chrome and rules exceptions. I found it just a little bit dry but suspect that is mostly due to not knowing the history. Easy to learn and plays fast. Enjoys some favorable similarities to Friedrich. A good and solid game but just short of great for me.

Beautiful game. Simple to pick up and with some great rules and mechanics that refresh the Columbia block system. 

I like it and I hope to get this in trade! 

UPDATE
Was able to play this again and this time with a better understanding of the rules. The game revolved around a series of major battles. I lost two, and won four. In all of these battles losses were pretty high, at the end there was little fighting and it was only because of lucky cards - I think - I was able to kill the opponent leader, at the last turn and last move. 

Overall there is a lot of tension in this game, and decisions have a high impact on the overall campaign since you don't have a lot of moves you can do and the beginning is slower, therefore making one choice over another will consign you victory, or doom you. That is a trademark of a very good game. One where decisions are all important, some of which are strategic, regarding the managing of the physical troops - the blocks - while others deal with trickier aspects, such as the willingness to fight for you - the cards - which have to be balanced each turn with the former decisions, creating hard decisions to make.

Significantly more difficult to teach than it appears. A simple, beautiful game, with interactions wonky enough to require several plays, and a willing partner, to digest. Can't rate this one yet.

Having an interest in feudal Japanese history and this battle in particular (I struggled through Eiji Yoshikawa's epic Taiko many years ago), and recent positive experiences with block games, buying this one was an easy decision for me. Its production is certainly beautiful and highly thematic, the rules are accessable and unique, and I very much enjoyed my first play of the game. I don't know how much replayability and variety of strategic options it will present, but I'm looking forward to finding out with repeat plays. I suspect my initial rating may rise.

Incomplete play of the game, just to figure out some of the mechanics.  Most of which are fairly straight forward, but there's definitely some oddness when dealing with the towers and also developing a movement strategy without having played before was awkward too.  I think the next full game will reveal lots of sweet surprises and make for better educated strategies.
---
And it did!
We still played a lot of rules wrong near the beginning of the game (too many recruitments, overrunning castles, etc.), but this was still a tense and fun game. The battles were huge and loyalty cards felt like aces as you hoped to time their use at just the right moment. I am now looking forward to future plays (though this is a long one).
Rating increased to an 8.

After one play, I'm cautiously optimistic. It seems to cram a fair amount of wargame decision-making into a tight ~90 minute package. That said, I'm not terribly enamored of the movement restrictions and the way your hand can dictate what you can and can't do. You really don't ever have much flexibility in terms of how you can marshal your forces.

RATING: 5
Okay: Strategic - Unification of Japan - Very easy

-Great theme, and the historic notes combined with the design notes fit the era
-The strong theme is supported with an exceptionally unique battle system. I have a love - hate relation with dice but was very sceptical about a combat resolution with cards as Maria & Friedrich is also a love - hate thing for me. The battle system in Sekigahara is as frustating as it is unique.
-Great components make the game even more evocative than it already is. Deep box Version is great.
-Great game for non wargamers.

Minus:
-I very much dislike the Point to Point System. I would have prefered Areas. The Point System represents the road net from back then and is a realistic representation of realistic movement but it is too constraining / repetitive for my tastes. So it is not a design isuue at all, it is an issue of the Person Rating the game.    
-The draw for blind blocks in the setup is the only variable. There is one scenario and a potential danger could be a sort of standard opening move. I know the variable blocks and variable cards on hand will prevent this from happening to lesser or larger extend. Time will tell if this holds true and for the moment it is only suspect.
-Sometimes I wish there were more blocks, armeis and cities to conquer and the scope of the conflict was larger. Again this says more about me.

Bottom line; a true WOW effect as far as components and theme are concerned, the gameplay is exciting but after repeated Play I disliked the constraints of movement.

Update: 
I am still feeling thrilled by the blocks, cards, map etc. The blind blocks and card hands somewhat enhance the replay value but it is marginal and although it lost something of it's novelty. 

Sold it.

As some might mention, Sekigahara is akin to Maria and Friederich but for two -- this is to say that it is a rich game of positional play, hand management, and psychology that is beautifully presented with aesthetically pleasant yet minimalist board.

The need to discard half you hand at the end of every round is an immanently painful task -- you are inevitably put into situations in which you cannot protect all fronts equally -- some fronts will need to be for show, others for battle (and going to battle also lets you cycle through your deck and make wild multi-front battles that rely on drawing something wildly different from what you just played!).

Tense, fun, and a design tour de force in making so little do so much.

RATING: 3
As usual this had a lot of buzz, like other non-grognard games from GMT & as usual i was pretty underwhelmed. The historical backdrop didn't suck me in, as i'm not into the whole japan/samurai stuff.
Gameplay is rather simple, but not elegant, there are a couple of minor exceptions & rules that don't make a lot of sense, e.g. the besieger has to attack the castle every turn, but doesn't have to play any cards.. so why does he have to attack every turn again (?).
Combat has some excitement as you're never sure if you're opponent has the right cards to play. But in the end it's pretty random, as there are no modifiers at all & there is simply no way to deduce what cards your opponent has. You can't even deplete his hand by attacking on one front and then attack on another, as everyone redraws all used cards after every battle.
Furthermore the point-to-point map is super simple & given the limited game length offers rather little strategic depth.
I never understood why deliberately & randomnly limiting control over your forces appeals to such a large player group.. maybe because players can then blame lady fortune for their downfall..? No idea..
I guess i'm just not the target group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
Sekigahara is a very prettily designed GMT block wargame, with excellent components, card-based play, considerable fog of war, and in all a nice quick-playing wargame experience.

The basis of play is that armies need cards to move, and need matching cards to fight.  So a large coalition may be useless unless there is a hand to back it up.

While the time period and flavour definitely reminded me of A Most Dangerous Time, the mechanisms made it a very different experience on a first play.

I think that Ishida is thrown a potentially major advantage with his card mix, which basically guarantees that if he wants last move he can have it.

In my first play, at least, that and the mix of blocks and cards proved to be a major advantage for Ishida, who won going away from Tokugawa.

I have to admit to myself that I have a clear preference for block games. Guess I'm a Fog of War junkie. This, Julius Caesar, Strike of the Eagle, Napoleon's Triumph....

I like this because it is quite a bit different from the usual Columbia-style block game. Despite the different mechanics it has a very "Columbia feel" (in a good way) to me. By which I mean, a small, error-free rulebook that is easily understood. A board that is pleasant. One or two small twists on the basic move-attack (the castles and resource locations to provide a focus for the combat).

The card-driven combat is refreshing. I do have concerns about the inability to withdraw or mitigate loses in anyway. Once you're in combat, you're basically going to take as much damage as your opponent feels like dishing out and there's nothing you do about it. I guess the lesson is to not get drawn into combat at all if you don't think you can win. But the game doesn't really allow Fabian style defenses.

In both my plays I lost because, despite winning in the final turn, I left Tokugawa too close to the front lines and within forced-march striking distance of a large force. You think I'd have learned after the first time!

There are some bits of the maps -- like the bottom-left -- that seem totally useless. In my two plays I can't imagine ever moving troops down there. The small number of paths and locations, and the fixed setup, make me wonder about the long-term playability of it. In my two plays there was a certain sameness. Not in a bad way. At least not yet. But I can envision it might play itself out. But given I've only played it twice in several months that could be a long way out.....

My second favorite game of 2011 after Strike of the Eagle.

I.absolutely.love.this.game.  That really speaks to the quality of the game system and game play because the historical theme never would have interested me -- at all -- ever.  A handful of games in and I see the absolute elegance of the very easy-to-understand system.  The choices are many, but not overwhelming.  An additional key benefit is its clean mechanics and relatively quick play time - about 2.5 hours for a newb like me.  Whoever coined the oft-quoted line: "Simplicity is the essence of design" probably had just finished a game of "Seki".  This game easily makes the A-List for me and is a First Minnesota game club favorite.  Most recommended.

Designer's rule tweak: "Two units are added to the initial deployment. The blocks 3-Uesugi and 1-Uesugi-Gun get a circle deployment mark in the lower right corner, and two additional deployment circles appear in the Aizu location (which already had 3 of them)."

Beautiful and thematic block wargame.Small battles all around the table for control of resources and castles set the stage for the big confrontation were both players line their troops revealing their poker hand hoping to achieve the greatest combo and that will inflict enough impact to slay the opposing army general.Rating will increase by more plays.

RATING: 7
A simple block wargame based around a highly original theme, one that Columbia hasn't tacked yet (and probably won't). This has a huge chaos factor though, a big stack may be very valuable or completely valueless depending on whether you have the right cards or not. That by itself I could live with, but fundamentally this is a game about building a big stack, then finding a small stack to beat up, and that substantially reduces the appeal for me.

I was so eager to get my hands on this one that I P500'd it. When I actually got down to it, I was kinda disappointed though. I didn't manage to finish the game, and although it seemed very interesting, something was off...

Finally got to put this to the test to see if hype was justified or just another over-hyped game, and was pleasantly surprised to learn that I think my design hesitations seem (need to play again) mostly unfounded (I had several) and that it combines a few elements from two of my favs, [b]Taj Mahal[/b] and [b]Maria[/b].   

So on my fears first. Control was the biggest worry, and game was mostly playing you. First off, you can use any card to move troops they don't need to match, so that was a relief, they do need to match in battles though. There was at least one battle where I was hooped, I got attacked and had 4 blocks defending and didn‚Äôt have a single card for one of them, it sucked and I took 2 losses (an option to withdraw with one loss or something similar would have helped). Thing is I think this was near beginning of the game, and in the beginning cards are VERY tight, too tight really by probably one card not sure, but as the game goes on, you almost start having too many cards, so the ‚Äúgetting hooped‚Äù issue is much much less likely to happen. There are also ways to mitigate it too, one is quite expensive which is to skip a turn and discard/re-card, but you can also cycle cards just by having battles, and you can choose which order battles happen as active player and you recard after each so that helps. You can also play extra cards to battles at times to cycle even further if needed. So overall, you do need to play (plan) to your current hand somewhat not unlike other games like this, and like them too it seems that control might actually be close to enough here as well but more play to confirm for me anyway. 

Another fear, was discarding half your cards, I thought, WTF, why is this rule even there?  Now I see, otherwise you would have way too many cards, it still stinks because at times you have to throw away good cards you need, but its not as bad as I thought, though I wonder if it could have been done differently (maybe they tried too and this worked best). And yet another fear (a big one too) was the Loyalty challenges, boy that seemed sucky (chaotic) thematic or not, though also easy to see it adds a great tension to each battle too. Well in our game there were about 6 challenges, and none of them worked. Its definitely going to suck when it does though, but you can somewhat protect against it as my first play showed, so I think and hope its not as bad I thought it would be, time will tell.  

So the rest of the game is great as I figured, really like the combat, movement, overrun, fight for castles, tough risk/reward decisions, extra points for beautiful components and easily digested elegant rules (though I found 10 holes in the first edition and wonder how many were filled in 2nd, likely only 3 I bet so will need to spend some time going through FAQ and forum). Definitely a crossover game I think that should appeal to Eurogamers (no dice always welcome by me) but should also please most Wargamers as well I would think. Definitely fun too with the bit of bluffing and tension, and quite bloody too with the bloodshed coming right from the start with 3 or more very precarious situations from the setup. Would have liked to of seen one more 'what if' scenario included for variety and replay value. Should even be wife-friendly which helps push it to my wantlist.  

--------------

Sounds interesting, might needs tweaks (draw extra card when drawing and discard 1 to lessen luck?)

Many people reporting game plays them, card draw swingy and too important, movement and how well you do in combat is all dependent on card draws (if there is something that bugs me in a wargame its a game system that tells me what I can and can't move and/or fight with and when) 

Edit - watched gameplay video, while there are some nice ideas like combat 1upmanship in a Hannibal/Taj way (always like this), tension and good opportunities for bluff etc overall it looks like it will feel like [i]"chess with cards"[/i] (and though built on good theme is quite abstract it seems too). Neat well developed package overall, but looks to be very overated and likely a 6 or 7 for me as the luck looks too high
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Innovative design combining blocks and cards. The semi-random set-up and random draw of reinforcements along with the card play all provide great replay value.

Historic wargame set at the battle between the 2 daimyos of japan.

The card mechanics are great, they allow you to plan a little but but because each turn you discard half your hand and redraw you can't always plan for everything. The loyalty cards also represent the history of the battle very well and lets you "steal" some of your opponents units away as defectors.

The wooden blocks themselves are nice and weighty and look good as they move across the map and lumber towards your opponent.

My only qualm is the map itself for the locations, since you have to place the blocks over the locations some spots can be a bit tight with large stacks of blocks and the accounting done for resource locations and castles can be a bit annoying as you have to try to peer around the blocks or under them to determine what is a resource location or see a castle blocked by a stack.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (June 2014)

I had high hopes for Sekigahara, sadly the game let me down. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt buy it. I don‚Äôt have anything bad to say about it, but I didn‚Äôt have much fun playing it and I‚Äôm not sure why this is, perhaps I‚Äôm not wargamer material.

The theme does nothing for me. It has some luck with the cards and in which units you take out of the bag. Still you can plan a lot so it doesn‚Äôt bother me.
I really dislike when I have to paste up components, but this is a personal issue. The game rules are not very complex and it comes with great player aids (as usual from GMT) so teaching the game is not that hard. It seems Tokugawa is a lot more powerful because he can almost always go first and that is very important. I‚Äôm not sure if this is an issue, I would have to play again to review it.

The game looks gorgeous with its block on the map. I also love that the designer donate his profits from the game to help people in need.

Bottom line, I will give it another chance, but for now it is off from my buy list. I will have to think hard to identify why Sekigahara failed to excite me. In theory I should like it, but I don‚Äôt.

One play only.

Beautifully produced block game set in medieval Japan. The cards are used well and add another layer of unpredictability, albeit you can be really hosed in a turn if the deal's unkind. Lots of tough (but interesting) decisions, especially when you have to discard cards or play one (or more) for movement rather than combat.

Putting all the components back in the box in such a way that the lid closes flush is almost a game in itself requiring a lot of patience and black-belt Tetris skills.

Sekigahara offers a rich, layered gaming experience unlike anything else I have played. The cards fuel virtually every aspect of the game, and therefore are resources that must be managed wisely. The hidden blocks add a sense of surprise and secrecy, while the key points on the map fuel tension throughout the game. The combat system in itself is a brilliant approach, giving players the opportunity to decide how far to press the attack or knowing when to conserve your hand for another battle. In my experience, every session is a tense, back-and-forth tug-of-war with the winner usually determined only in the final round, and only then by a point or two. This a true gem of a game that keeps me coming back for more.

A rather neat and refreshing take on the block genre.  The diceless combat (driven by a hand of cards which 'activate' units in combat), actually manages to pack in the tension when the battles are roughly even in number.  The first game can be a bit rough for a new player, but I've never had anyone not want to go back for a second bite.

There are two faults for me.  First, battles are a little too indecisive for my taste when they take place between large armies.  I wish larger forces suffered more casualties when forced to retreat.  As it stands, it seems too easy for big forces (9+ blocks) to sit around and pound away at one another for several battles in a row.

Second, cards are so precious and hard to get that the resource management can feel like it prevents the players from ever using many of the options in the rulebook.  There are just too many ways to use cards and, as a result, it feels like waging war for the throne of Japan on a shoestring budget.

That said, I keep coming back to this game and every time we play it, I have a great time so don't pass on it just because I have a few nitpicks.

RATING: 7
One of the best wargames, most similar to Napoleon's Triumph. Deterministic combat with randomness introduced by the random draws of units and cards but no dice. Randomness can be mitigated, making a sound strategy and tactical exploits more decisive than luck. There are a few basic things I should never do again such as going into a siege with a force too weak to kill a unit or leaving leaders isolated. 

The game is a set piece with slight variation between plays by a few random units in the initial setup. The standard strategy should see Ishida cleaning out the western part while Tokugawa should wipe out the Ishida presence in the east. Within that frame it's the tactical optimization of resources and bluffing through hand management. Switching between aggressive attacks and consolidating forces is a challenge although the game system encourages aggression as half of the unplayed cards have to be discarded each turn. While my personal enjoyment as a non-wargamer wasn't up to the level of its rating, I can appreciate the design.

A game that reward you greatly with your decision making, Push while you have the right cards, take advantage and capitalize on your enemy mistake whenever possible. Yet these opportunity is often not very apparent due to the different layers of uncertainty provided in the game(cards/ fog of war with blocks), every battle is like playing an intense game of poker. 

A excellent game that provide great excitement within 90-120 mins.

There are many wargames in the world, but only this one has managed to lure me in.  

It could be that the game is very simple and elegant (for a wargame).  You are essentially playing chess on a map of Japan, and your pieces only eliminate each other if you have the cards in hand to activate them.  In this simplicity, the game still affords bluffing, betrayal, and lots of "oh yeah, but can you beat THIS?"; the essentials of a good fight.

It could also be that the designer gives the Japanese theme some care and respect, opting for a more understated, museum-like treatment of the subject rather than something very brash and Westernized.  The notes on the history in the manual are very nicely-done, and it's clear the designer knew just how many brush strokes to use for this painting.

RATING: 5
I just played my first game and I must say I am disappointed. Theoretically there are a lot of possible decisions to make but I didn't really felt like I have a variety of possible strategies to choose from. It's just moving and battling, moving and battling and it's like that all the game. Through the most of the game the set of possible decisions is seriously limited by the available cards. In the first half of the game there were few battles, only latter the battles became more frequent and more exciting.

The game is published very nicely. The mounted board, cards and everything else is awesome. The only serious problem is the fact that blocks are too big. It's OK if you keep 2 or 3 block in one location but as you place more blocks in one location in becomes a real nightmare. It's hard to tell which units are standing in which location and hard to move them around. The board gets really crowded, especially in the region of Kyoto and Osaka, where the cities are just next to each other and they have to accommodate armies consisting of over 10 blocks.

I really hope this rating goes up after few more plays.

UPDATE: Nope, the game is boring. Sold my copy

UPDATE 2: I bought it again. After few more plays I think it is really good!

(Rating based on several plays)

I owned first edition of this game, but sold it because I found it boring. But then I kept hearing so many good comments about this game that I decided to give it a second chance and buy the second printing. After a few more plays I finally grasped this game and I really enjoy it. It forces players to make tough decissions and play agressively (but not recklessly!). I observed that it tends to frustrate first-time players, just the way it frustrated me when I played it for the first time.

RATING: 6
CRITIQUE OF SEKIGAHARA
Sekigahara is a difficult game to critique, because there were things about it that struck me as brilliant, but then there were things that made playing it hopelessly unsatisfying.

The design of the game certainly follows a "form over function" aesthetic. This is both a positive and a negative, I'm afraid. There's  no doubt that Sekigahara, while I owned it, was one of the most beautiful games in my collection. And the attention to detail is amazing! Everything resonates with the feel of Japanese history. However, games also have to be functional and here the game has serious problems. Key elements on the board are always going to be obscured by your blocks. The symbols for the various Daimyos could have been easier to differentiate. The board should have provided a track for recording the number of supply centers and castles you control. As a work of art it's beautiful, but as a game it has problems.

A minor annoyance, but worth mentioning... the box is too small. It takes a lot of work to get everything to fit, and even then it won't close all the way.

As well as the beauty of the components, there were certain things about the gameplay that I loved. The thematic "one unit per road" movement, while limiting, is limiting in the best possible way. It makes perfect sense, historically. Similarly, the back and forth cardplay that's used when armies fight is just brilliant. I wish more games were designed this way (retaining initiative only so long as you are at a disadvantage). In almost every battle both sides are going to suffer casualties, which is fantastic.

But ultimately the hand management part of the game made it unsatisfying. The combination of not being able to control critical armies at the same time that I wasn't able to keep a significant number of cards from turn to turn just left me with the feeling that the game was playing me. Even the simple act of trying to build a good hand was frustrating, because your three card advantage over your opponent would become one card the next turn.

Another issue is the Loyalty cards. I always felt like managing my hand revolved entirely around avoiding my opponent's Loyalty challenges, which is a bit of a problem. While I understand that these cards reflect the historical reality, in practice they are just odd. One of your units will flip, attack you, then immediately come back into the fold. I realize that the game would be unplayable if their betrayal were permanent, but this flipping back and forth just doesn't make sense.

But there are even more problems with the gameplay. In practice, the distribution of the units at the start means that very early on the map is almost always split right down the middle (black on one side, yellow on the other) and the fact that this happens so regularly makes it seem as though it was designed to play out this way. Perhaps this also reflects history, but it makes every game feel too much the same.

That is what finally killed Sekigaraha for me: the sameness of every game. Once the newness of the sometimes brilliant mechanics wore off I found that it was just repetitious. So, while it was visually stunning and often challenging and sometimes interesting it was never fun. All the strategic decisions just never felt like they had much of an impact on the outcome of the game. The board was split, cards were spent, units were won or lost... and towards the end there was a mad dash for that one contested castle that would decide the game. This is why I sold it off.

I'm calling this an 8, but may upgrade it to a 10.  My main reservation is about replayability, but I've played this half a dozen times in the last month (always as Ishida!), and every game has been different.

I've had a lot of luck with this at game groups where people aren't really wargamers; lots of people like the theme, and it's surprisingly easy to teach.  (Tonight's game came in at 3 hours, including teaching, in which Tokugawa got killed in turn 7.)

- unique, high-stress system for battles (actually [i]everything[/i] in this game is high-stress)
- easy to teach
- great player summary sheet, well-written rules
- good historical notes

RATING: 9
Reading about Sekigahara I was pretty sceptical at first, but as soon as I got to reading the rules, it felt right. It's a really original and highly abstracted card driven block wargame; no event cards, A/B/C attack order or such, no step reduction or even dice. Just maneuvering, bluff, hand management and card play to get your troops actually fight for your cause. Some gamier moments can feel a little dumb (there are moments when you might have to send troops to a suicide mission just to get your hand replenished with better cards before a decisive battle), but in all its abstract simplicity it actually manages to capture the essence of the conflict and political situation of the moment. The sides are nicely balanced, yet asymmetric enough, and it plays in 2-3 hours or sometimes even less. Near perfect for what it is.

Played once, 2p.  I liked this quite a bit.  It is a fairly light wargame, given its card driven nature.  It is not at all uncommon to simply not have the cards to help your cause.  But the components are just top notch, and there are some neat mechanics (loyalty!).  Rating is help by the general game time: this is a wargame that can easily be played in 2 hours, even with new players.

RATING: 8
This is a solid two player block game that is very easy to learn and teach and plays fairly quickly as well!  The card system is well developed and rather innovative as you can only deploy forces which you have the cards that match their mon (symbol).  There are several special cards including one that allows you to attempt to cause an opponent's block to be a traitor and join your side if they don't have a card of the same symbol remaining in their hand!  Battles can become quite tense and pivotal.  Losing is not necessarily horrendous at times as you can gain additional cards as compensation allowing you to suddenly attack with another nearby stack!  The game rewards playing numerous cards/blocks of the same mon(symbol) but armies that are built of one mon can quickly become quite weak if the cards are used up for that symbol...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very cool block wargame that breaks the conventions of its genre with an intriguing diceless combat system and some unique movement rules.  Not as dry as the Simmons diceless block games because of the random elements provided by the hands of cards. A possible knock against this is that hand management is quite important to one's success which can make this feel less like a traditional wargame.  This is not a problem for me though.

I was delved into MMP's A Most Dangerous Time for the Sengokau time and very much satisfied with that game for realistic gaming on the history.  This is a fascinating period for everyone to enjoy. The leaders are many and heroic stories were told. However, I am not sure if I need an abstract block game (not that block game so common a system) on such period abstracting out a lot of the captivating elements.

Sekigahara is a beguiling war game of perceived threats and subtle strategies where precarious timing greatly affects success as one‚Äôs fate literally lies in one‚Äôs hands, specifically the hand of cards which fuels every aspect of this impressive game. It‚Äôs an alluring mix of potency and deception that plays most elegantly.

Very nice.The components are awesome.Alas difficult to play solitaire. The game play is somewhat repetitive. A bit too abstract a Wargame for my tastes. I see it more as a strategic "Eurogame" I can goad my regular non-wargamer friends into playing. Heh heh heh.

As a pure Eurogame, I would rate it a 8, as a wargame, a 5.

There are some things that Sekigahara does amazingly.  The movement system is simple but effective.  The card management system leads to interesting decisions (but more on this later).  The impact scale is a clever way to simulate waves of troops that may or may not have trained with each other.

But then there are other problems with Sekigahara, specifically with the way that you actually play cards into combat.  While the impact scale is clever and the hand management leads to interesting choices, the two mechanics do not play well in the same system.  You have next to no logistical control over combat.  A giant force of elite troops can get slaughtered without reaction.  Don't get me wrong; I like a combat system where David can beat Goliath.  However, in Sekigahara, Goliath doesn't just get beaten.  Instead, he slowly dies without even being aware that there's a fight going on.

Due to cards in hand cycling in and out so quickly, it's impossible to guarantee that you'll have relevant cards for your stacks to participate in any given fight.  The argument then becomes to diversify your troops in a stack, but there's no reason to think that your hand will not then become homogeneous.  The game actually finds a way to punish you for trying to sculpt a perfect hand by forcing 50% discards every week, and even if you do build a hand to effectively use a stack, you're immediately stuck with a new hand after each fight, and there are typically at least four fights in each of the game's seven weeks (rounds).

I was actually reminded of [thing=475]Taj Mahal[/thing], of all games.  However, in Taj Mahal, you have the opportunity to craft a hand by bowing out of conflict early, and there is no forced discard.  The conflicts in Taj Mahal are also often indirect (although there is plenty of direct bidding wars).  The basic mechanic seems to work better there.

Sekigahara is very nice looks, and is probably about 60% of a good game.  The combat system just doesn't work effectively within the hand management system, and the overall game suffers for it.

RATING: 9
An amazing block game with chess like strategy. Maximizing movement for stacks is more fun than it sounds. This is easily a classic, and a game I've considered getting a printed canvas map for, as to help the stacks stay stacked and not reveal your forces due to a bump in the board.

This game is also GORGEOUS! Black and gold look amazing together, and the entire design is so minimalist that I just want to frame the damn thing and hang it in the living room.

Not a simulation but based on several very thematic and atmospheric mechanisms which are also interesting gameplay-wise. Very competitive and fast to learn. All the complexity lies in the gameplay and not in rule-overkill just complicating things. The need to deploy units with cards combines wonderfully with the stack-managing-aspects of the game opening the way for a lot of different approaches and gameplay-exploration. Also there is enough chance and luck to even out a bit different skill-levels.

A very thematic and historically accurate game about the battle of Sekigahara, which includes the clan alliances, some historical characters and the impending alliance betrayals, which was decisive in the real battle.

As you play, you will feel all the uncertainty and fluid alliances that ruled in that time. You will feel the tension that time's generals felt.

Plus, it has no dice!

Altough luck, in this game, is a factor, if you plan enough, you will be able to minimize it and just act on other areas of the map if you don't draw the card you want.

So, it's not possible to complain about bad luck.

This is a gem. One of the best (if not the best) wargames I have ever played.

With really tough decisions faced each turn, I found myself often torn between vastly different options, not able to make any sort of half measure plays. Incredibly frustrating when you have an army poised to go but no cards to compliment them, or as you amass a huge defensive force and hoard loads of relevant mons but then your opponent attacks elsewhere or the turn ends and you have to discard lots of them... But this frustration and optimisation of resources is what makes it such a skillful and rewarding experience.

RATING: N/A
A wonderful game. Elegant, simple, beautiful to look at, and loads of fun. At its core it's a very tense game of bluff. It reminds me of the early Gamma Two block games the way it captures something so seemingly central to a situation with such simple play and mechanics. The historical notes are superb too - which I appreciated as I know very little about medieval Japanese military history.

Rating based on 2 players.

As a newbie I didn't last too long, but I saw enough to know that I want to play more of this. Streamlined rules, tied to history via game mechanics rather than through situational rules, bluffing, and a little bit of luck... this is the sort of wargame I like.

After playing it again, it holds up!

RATING: 8
I really love the battles, the combination of blocks and loyalty cards is very tense, especially when combined with loyalty checks. I also like the castle-siege aspect.

However I still feel the game is a bit slow-moving... like lack of cards means that my default turn is 1 block moving instead of 3 or all; in fact, I only move all at most twice a game. Similarly, forced march is almost never an option. And it's painfully expensive to bring the yellow cubes in to Osaka because of this card shortage.

I'm also still struggling a bit with yellow. Though I win often with yellow and am improving, the game's asymmetry makes black so much easier to grasp. I've actually played two full games against myself to try and develop a better yellow strategy, but black won both times (though once by only one point). The benefits of black are obvious: cards for turn order (randomly selected, black wins 70% of the time), black's +1 castle gives an extra card which is huge given the hampered mobility, initial setup gives black more troops and more correlated troops (i.e. locations are more likely to be coordinated symbols at the start), etc. I'll keep trying :)

Essentially an abstract game with a pasted on theme, it does very little to evoke the period.

Very sensitive to the initial random block set up and card draw. In both our games the black player walked to easy wins due to the initial set up/draws favoring them, leaving the yellow player chasing the game even though they start from the weaker position in terms of card draws and board position. There are so many better games out there.

RATING: 7
Sekigahara is a good game, with beautiful components, but some fiddly rules with annoying exceptions not summarised on the player aid (even in the third printing), which pales in comparison to the usual Universal Head player aids. Some agonising choices to be made - which makes the game run longer than it should.

I can see there is a lot of tactical depth lying underneath, but I don't think it will hit the table much.  The game I played ran very long - over 3 hours after an aborted first round (so we had most of the rules down).  At that length it is competing with some titles that are hard to beat, including war of the ring and other heavier games (eg coin series), but also the Columbia block games (which have a more intuitive rule set), which can comfortably finished and even another game played within that window.  Time to put this one on the trade / sale list

RATING: 6
Block games are not really my bag I think but I like this one well enough, probably due to the interesting, fun, yet simple cardplay.  The only real gripe I have is that the stacks are sizeable enough that it can be hard to grasp the shape of the board.

RATING: 7.5
Very good looking game with a great card management mechanic.  I'm wondering though if just flushing/cycling one's hand/deck is the only option here.  Some card protection is available from turn to turn but, when you get one faction's cards you need to make hay while the sun shines or they will sit in the discard pile for most of the game.

12/06/14 Played a game in four hours. 
Sekigahara is from GMT, a wargame publisher that I have a generally low opinion of as their typical fare are games with 40 page rule books, 500+ counters with many tiny numbers on them, flimsy paper maps, very complex rules, and often a duration of 7+ hours. I've only bought one GMT wargame, 15 years ago, and it so put me off the company I've never bought another. Yet for some reason this one is different. Sekigahara has a hard mounted map, low complexity rules, and plenty of strategy without many hundreds of units. Alas this does not signal an overall change in GMT. For they will continue to put out that other type of game in droves for many years to come. 
- Positives: the hard mounted board, the very thick blocks (making them stackable), the graphics, the cards, the combat system, the low density of units.  
- Negatives: its hard to keep track of castles and resource cities as they are habitually covered up with blocks, the point to point map means maybe eight blocks will be piled up in a city (plus maybe ten blocks attacking) therefore spilling over into adjacent cities thereby making it hard to keep track of the mess (or see your own blocks), some of the clan symbols are hard to tell apart, there should have been a track on the board to track which player currently had how many castles and resource locations, a very large chaos factor as you may be unable to move/fight your armies if you don't have the right cards.

After hearing so much about this game, recently obtained a copy via my FLGS. Having finally played it, I'd say it lives up to its rep. It's a beautiful looking game, and it's fantastically complex, without having very complex rules. Between manipulating your army and manipulating your card hand, there is plenty to think about. Also plenty of positional play -- should I move this army stack and leave myself open to the opponent's possible riposte or not? This is a great and unique design. I'm sure you could play this 50 times and still be trying to understand the best strategies.

I am very happy I finally have this game.

Tremendous, elegant design that takes the block game genre many steps forward with card driven gameplay, tight, strategic decisions every turn and it does it inside a very nice theme. This doesn't seem like a pasted on theme - the design of the gameplay itself fits the theme of Feudal Japan well. After an initial play, I have to rate this a 9.5 - and it might be the only game I have given a 10 so far, depending upon further gameplay.

RATING: 9.5
Having play-tested this about a dozen times, I need to weigh in here - this game is going to change the way we look at block games (for the better!).  Cards are an approximation of "mandate/leadership/motivation" that activate blocks in battle - and can also be used to get additional movement and turns.  You get them by controlling castles, you lose them by losing battles and driving your troops hard.  Not since Rick Young's "special activation chits" (Europe Engulfed) have I seen an abstraction mechanism like this that "feels" so right, and keeps the game rolling so that it really is DONE in under 3 hours.  The two sides also play very differently - but this game is FUN.  When you open it up and you don't see any dice and the blocks aren't like any game you've ever seen, you'll have a big question mark in your head (much like I had when I opened up Bonaparte at Marengo) - but stick with it for one game - this one has long, long legs.  The beginning is differentiated every time, there is an intense "tightness" of choice and bluffing, leading to a mid-game of reasonably sized battles, and sometimes ending with the big showdown.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Sekigahara is one of those games I'll never get to play as often as I'd like. It's masterful hand-management game above all else, but the cards inform the excellent board play in wonderfully thematic and tense ways.

Also, as wargames go, you'd be hard-pressed to find one with such engaging gameplay combined with such a streamlined ruleset. Granted, the game leans towards the abstract end of the spectrum but not to its detriment.

This is a block game that uses cards to activate your units in battle. There is a clever loyalty aspect to the game built into the card system.

The battles are really the highlight here with the units having to be deployed with cards and gaining strength from other units of their own type. Also you never know when your opponent may throw a loyalty challenge at you potentially switching the block from your side to theirs.

Thumbs up from me so far.

Check my thread on Siege rules if you having any trouble with those.

Great pieces and map really is nice for gameplay.

2nd Edition
One of the most elegant games ever.
Update: Upgraded to a 10. I have played several games the last few days. This game is an absolute masterpiece of design. Elegant, simple, strategically and tactically deep, not too long, tense, perfect amount of chrome, stellar components, clear rules, perfectly abstracts the atmosphere of its age. It also works in so many features (loyalty, uncertainty that is very manageable but not random, troop exhaustion) that are so invisible to game play but perfectly woven into the rules and mechanics. And even if you think you are not a war-gamer, you can love this game. It is as close to a perfect game as I can imagine. The only question mark may be re-playability. So far it seems like the partial random block placement will take care of that, but I won't know that for awhile. I would love to see the system used for other wargames.

This is the most frustrating game I have ever played! And I mean that in the best sense possible.

From the get go, you start stressing out over which cards you should drop, where should you focus on movement, when should you ignore the odds stacked against you and charge in with your daimyo, etc. And for every action you take, you limit your future possibilities, and reduce your knowledge of what to come.

Absolutely a fabulous game, and I cannot recommend it enough!

Rating based on three games, it can still change.

I don't like wargames so much any more, because of the usually too low ratio between bookkeeping and strategic choices. There are exception, most notably Maria.

I bought Sekigahara because I imagined to be a different wargame, user-friendly and not needing an encyclopedic handbook. I was not disappointed. All expectation from this point of view have been satisfied.

The reason it doesn't score higher for me is that it seems to me more tactical than strategical. The way the cards are played is similar to Maria (and I like it) but because in Sekigahara a  player can keep only a small amount of cards in his hands, it doesn't allow a strategy based on them. There is in this way more luck-dependence and consequently a game based on the card draws, with optimization turn by turn, instead of a broader strategic view as I would have liked more.

Because of this and more generally for my not so strong wish to play it again, I consider the game good but not great. As said rating may change if / when I manage to play it more.

The game is pretty easy and flows very well. The card combat system adds a nice second layer of fog of war to the game. It's a little bit like: If the game had dice, you would know before the fight if you would roll good or bad, but you don't know what your opponent would roll... Very good game.

Probably my favorite block game, but I have found I don't like block games all that much. At least not enough to have them as favorites. Memorization becomes too important, and I just don't want to bother. I like the card-driven combat a lot, but I would enjoy the game more if it was not a block game, or if you had at least a little bit more knowledge about enemy blocks. The cards introduce plenty of uncertainty by themselves. With the blocks it just becomes too much hidden information, and I give up trying to think about my moves.

But I recommend the game to any fan of block games.

I am not a huge fan of this game but it might satisfy my current fascination with Japanese civilization. Mechanics are simple but decisions are tough.

Interestingly it's probably the wargame requiring the least education. You dont even need to be able to read or count to play it, just recognize the patterns. I'm thinking of playing a game with my 4 year old son (who has been insisting he wants to play 'the game of the Chinese')

This is a preliminary rating. First of all, the game is not as innovative as some wargamers claim. We‚Äôve seen diceless combat in Napoleon‚Äôs Triumph and a combination of blocks and cards in Rommel in the Desert. This is a good game nonetheless. Matt Calkins has made a good synthesis of various elements. The game is beautiful to look at and it plays in under two hours, which is really nice. The rules are really well written and easy to learn. Well done! The game is a bit abstract and might not have a lasting appeal. Only time will tell. As a simulation this game is not deep at all. Moreover, in my first game I had a slight feeling that the game was palying me. The box is a pain in the ass: getting everything back in is hard work (I now have a bigger box, thanks GMT!).

I understand that the aim of the designer was distilling the peculiarities of the campaign in the simplest of mechanics, but I think that in the process too much chrome was discarded, and in the end the game feels more like an abstract and less like a simulation. Not a bad game [i]per se[/i], but firmly in the field of Eurogames, even if a bit too long for that.

[b]Sekigahara: The Unification of Japan[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10 -> [b]10[/b]):[/COLOR]

[i]I've managed one more play of Sekigahara and had another great experience. I only wish I knew someone I could consistently play this with; my kids have no interest in this style of game. If you are looking for a great intro into war games, block games in particular, then look no further than Sekigahara. The theme shines through, in fact I ended up watching a history vlog that discussed the actual battle. Even though I've only played twice, Sekigahara has stood the test of time and is still a stand out new to me game from 2016 that I hope to play again soon.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]Wow, this was an amazing game play experience. I've been wanting to play Sekigahara for years, but didn't know anyone with the game and wasn't sure I'd find opponents if I bought the game. I finally got the opportunity to play with someone from my game group and was it worth the wait. I haven't played many war games, and this is probably the heaviest, but it is by far the most fun I've had playing one. 

The dice-less combat reduces the luck factor almost completely; you can still be hosed by your card draw but there are ways to mitigate even that. Card play is really rewarding and hand management is filled with agonizing decisions because cards are played to determine initiative, move units, activate units in combat and the dreaded loyalty cards (which can flip units to your opponents side for that combat). Game play is asymmetrical with what first appear as minor differences, but once as the game is played can be game changing differences that will effect your strategies. 

The last thing I will mention is how beautiful this game looks on the table. The are blocks are big and chunky, painted black and gold and the stickers display each units mon and special unit symbol making the block design clean and elegant, also has the board is beautiful (although it would've been nice to have tracks to keep track of castle and resource control). 

I am determined to play this game more before another year rolls by, in fact I am thinking of getting a copy since I have another friend interested in learning/playing. I want to carve out time to play these heavier/longer games in 2017. I can't recommend this game highly enough and can't wait to sit at the table and play again.[/i]

All about bluffing with your cards and troops. It has a low complexity, is beautiful and plays fast. Very recommendable given such premises.

A new, clever take on the block game.  Lots of fog of war.  No dice.  Extreme hand management with lots of chaos and unexpected turns.  Simplicity with massive re-playability.  Pretty.  A great game. 

EDIT 3/2014=Having now played the game four times live, I do declare that this is one of my favorite games of all time.  If it were a bit more re-playable in terms of scenario setup, I'd give it a 10.

Too much crowding around the same key choke points and waiting for the right cards. Was okay for a couple plays but not much replay value. The blocks are a hassle to move around, constantly tipping over and it's a struggle to see the location markers on the board. Sold.

I like the asymmetric sides and the bluffing aspect.  I can see where gameplay might become a bit scripted based on the map.  There aren't many alternative paths to victory for each side in the end, and they end up fighting over the same points.  But that is how things played out historically, and the variable reinforcements and combat means it has the potential to go in ahistorical directions.  I want to play it again with the other side, for sure.

Rating after one game.  I can see how this game would get more interesting once a few games are played.  Lots of bluffing, once both players know enough about the game.  Board is pretty, as are the wooden playing pieces.  Definitely want to play this game a few more times... I suspect the rating will improves once I get a better handle on the rules.  Am watching James Clavell's 1980 Shogun TV series for inspiration, as that covers this game's theme. :)

One of the best games I have played this year. The thought put into the game can really be seen, with the detail to authenticity. The instructions provide a lot of back story to immerse you into the game and the mechanics are designed to imitate real life events. The mechanics also work great together and provide a very original game play that is not too complex in itself but opens the game to a lot of possibilities. At the end of my first game, I was surprised to find out we had been playing for almost 2.5 hours. Lots of fun.

A block wargame come hand management game; abstract enough to enthral euro gamers and war gamey enough to entice grognards to the table. It is usually a tense affair because of the makeup of the road network and the restrictions on troop movements. The games I‚Äôve played have usually hinged on a few larger battles around the Sekigahara area of the board, which just feels right and lends the game some historical weight.

The components are absolutely beautiful, the map is fantastic and the blocks with their historical mons of the different clans involved in the conflict are just fantastic, the cards are solid and very easy to read.

The battle system, using cards to send specific blocks into battle is very cool and adds a lot of subtlety to the timing and outcome of fights, the specialised units (Cavalry and Rifle units) can be devastating if used correctly.

Probably the best GMT game I have played so far (only TS would come close). Love the fog of war and the elegance of the blocks. Seems a little random though and I would like to play a few more games to give it a more thorough examination.

First play was so-so, but we also missed a MAJOR rule in the game which basically threw off the entire game. Felt like cards were extremely tight until I realized you refill your hand after each battle with the amount of cards you played...whoops. My only complaint is the armies can get pretty large and are hard to move without spilling everywhere.

RATING: 10
Very nice game. I had worries about variation issues, but after 15+ games I've just scratched the surface - there is much more to explore. 

Physically outstanding. 

One has to carefully control card-flow and mix of troops before initiating battle. Big masses of troops will mean nothing if you have no way to control them. It needs some games to get a feeling for this. Pure clan-stacks are very powerful IF you have the cards to make them fight. But after one or two battles those troops are next to useless (because their Cards are exhausted). You have to keep troops around critical sites, and once your Hand is right, you use your cards to move the troops that are in sync with your hand Forward, and try to deal out a crushing blow. The concept of castles, bidding for first move, paying for move  etc. is a cleverly thouhgt-out concept! 

Currently one of my favourite games.

Absolutely superb. Just assymetrical enough to add flavor to the game without ending up wildly unbalanced, or with one or another player not grasping that their strategy should be significantly different than the other. Simple enough to learn in half an hour, but with a massive amount of depth. Highly recommended.

Love it! Block wargame with a very thick fog of war, in which you have to manage your resources and options very carefully. I don't think I'm a big fan of the limited information (of block wargames), but here it creates a ton of tension and interesting guessing and bluffing moves.

What I like best about Sekigahara is the fact that you can, and must, make grand strategic plans, but every battle, maybe even every card played, matters and influences your decisions and the outcome of the war. Incredible!

What keeps me from rating this a 10, is that every turn feels a bit same-y. Sure, the first fights are kinda clumsy, and later on you have big, carefully managed armies clashing, but still, every turn, every fight is play a card, show a block, play a card, show a block, draw replacement cards. Sieges and retreats just aren't very interesting. Single battles are fun, tense affairs, but your options are too limited to keep a series of fights interesting.

Still, very much recommended!

A fantastic two-player block wargame. It has elements reminiscent of an abstract game mixed into the wargame aspects. You feel constrained and held back, but is actually quite a nice design concept. I feel like I need to do 2-3 more things every turn than I am able to do.

I want to love this game more than I actually do. It really deserves to be a '9', but it's held back by some production issues and rules issues. The first edition box was too small for all of the blocks to fit unless you stored them in a particular way outside of the bags. This was fixed for the second edition, thankfully. There needs to be a victory point track to keep track of points instead of having to count on the board all of the time. In every game I've played, there's been a scoring error by one of the players that impacted late game decision making. I've seen players lose because of this mistake, and the sad thing is that this is avoidable with a little bit of extra work by GMT. There's even room on the existing 2nd edition board for there to be a scoring track.

The bigger issue is that it's the kind of game that you really need to play twice in one sitting, once as a learning game, and a real game afterwards. Unless you're bringing this to the table a lot, you're going to forget all of the special rules that can dramatically change there game outcome, and you're going to trip through the first half of the game getting the rules right, and not feel confident until when the game is almost over. After making this mistake several times teaching new players, I am now going to require a learning game or partial game beforehand and then play the real game.

PS: Why in the world is the movement bonus table not printed on the board?! Or, reference cards for players....please!

Light, simple, and quick-playing wargame with a somewhat counter-intuitive yet inventive combat system that rewards aggression.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The upside:
-Great lesson of history throughout the rulebook and during play. Reading the designer notes really opens up layers of enjoyment during the game, it makes you recognize some of the same challenges faced by Tokugawa and Ichida.
-Quite introduceable to non-wargamers.
-Gorgeous art and great components.

The downside:
-Not easy to manage "great stacks of death"
-Hand management issues related to discarding half of your hand everyweek. Increases the luck factor, and the feeling that recurrently appears of not being able to use the army that you should be using.

Rating after two plays at 8.5.  Pretty excellent game -- interesting (though somewhat constricted) movement, multiple strategies to victory, difficult decisions, opportunity for inspired play, beautiful production by GMT.  Potential for this rating to go up as I develop a greater understanding of the strategies -- Ishida seems pretty hard to win with, but I keep thinking of things to try.

After four plays at 9.0, with potential to waver either way.  Won with Ishida at last.  Now I wonder if there are multiple ways to achieve victory with either side.  I look forward to more experimentation, though.

Solo con la primera partida me ha encantado, muy original el uso de las cartas y muy diferente el juego en si, a pesar de que son pocas hojas de reglas, las posibilidades en cada turno y el uso que puedes hacer de las cartas, hace que tengas que pensar mucho que hacer. De momento, me tiene ganado.

Very impressive. Ten minutes into first game we were playing each other, not the system. Lots of tension between map position and hand management. Seems that you need to strong-suit at least one power, and neglect others. I can see opportunity for bluff and counter-bluff. 

It's apparent the values underlying the system - army sizes, casualty levels, card distribution, movement ranges - have been thoroughly developed and tested. Smart break points over block numbers and casualty/seige levels.

Eager to play more. A genuinely original and elegant evolution of block wargaming.

A card-driven block wargame.

The blocks represent the troops, specifically their clan affiliation and strength.

The cards represent the troops' willingness to fight.
When two armies (stacks of blocks) meet, players take turns playing cards in order to deploy blocks of the matching clan into the battle.  Only deployed blocks count for the outcome of the battle.

The result is that while the blocks represent the physical troops, the cards represent the troop's loyalty and willingness to fight.

I have played this twice.  Really a terrific game system.  Elegant.  Manages, through the card distribution, to capture the somewhat self-leveling nature of warfare in this period.  Both times I was Tokugawa.  Won narrowly the first time and then, with some good fortune, easily the second.  I'm wondering if the game is a bit unbalanced in favor of Tokugawa.  Seems to be.  I need to get this one on the table more often and find out.  1-11-16 - Have played a couple more times since this review.  Once as each side.  I still say this is a fantastic game. Such beautiful components and elegant mechanics.  It really should be played more often.  Seems it is an easier play as Tokugawa but I have seen Ishida win.

I have not played this game enough to have a good grasp of what is possible. These are first impressions but I'm left wondering why this game is rated so highly. When the cards are uncooperative, it feels like there is little that can be done besides bluff. If your bluff is called, you lose. If the cards remain uncooperative throughout the entire game, you cannot effectively activate your forces. I haven't figured out if it's possible to win a game when your cards don't match your blocks the majority of the time. Good strategy seems to consist of positioning your forces strategically, and then waiting for the necessary cards to arrive. Whether or not you get your cards before your opponent gets their's is not under either player's control. It‚Äôs also necessary to know how to mitigate loyalty checks, which are another fun/frustrating aspect of the game. Although I find this game to be fun, for the most part, there seems to be too much luck, leaving me unsatisfied with the game so far. If you win, you congratulate yourself on your strategic sense but you know that you can't take very much credit for the win because so much of it was determine by fate when the decks were shuffled. One thing I really love, though, is the artwork in the game: the Japanese aesthetic is well realized in the beautiful map and high quality components.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I'm a bit biased against 2-player wargames unless they have many scenarios like M44, but I enjoy this one as it's still pretty light and plays quickly.  Pretty abstract, but the components and board are really nice and you can get some flavor out of it you try. It's a block game but as far as I can tell, the use of blocks is primarily to allow you to hid the location of your main leader, which if you lose is the way your opponent can wins unless the game goes to end game scoring (which seems like most games would).  So there's a memory aspect of remembering what units an army previously revealed, which I don't find particularly interesting, but most of the uncertainty is not knowing what cards your opponent has - he may not have the right cards to deploy the units he wants to defend against you.  

It reminds me a bit of Maria, in the card play combat, but with none of the tension - you basically go into the battle knowing how many cards you're going to play and how many multiple of 7 you can reach, with sometimes the leading player not needing to play all the cards he plans because he's already won and can't get to the next factor of 7.  However, it's quite different from Maria/Friedrich because of the much higher rate of turnover in your hand in Sekigahara.  In M/F, every card is precious because you always draw the same number of cards at the beginning of your turn, and must be prepared to defend on opponents' turns.  In Sekigahara, you replace every card played in combat, you get cards for losing blocks, but then have to discard half your hand every 2 turns, so the cards are just flowing through your hand, and sometimes you might want to even lose blocks and waste cards on a small army, so that you can get more and better cards to use for your bigger, more important army.

I was pretty disappointed with the way loyalty and fluid alliances was incorporated - I was hoping for some daimyos to be more or less likely to shift alliances.  As is, you basically just save your weakest deployment within a faction as your last card - Loyalty Challenges usually fail, but they are a big swing when they succeed.   All in all, it's a good game but I don't see much replayability and would not purchase it.

--Jan2013-- Very nice bluff and balance game.  While I'd not made very many reasonable decisions in the first few turns (and made a howling blunder about failing to expect a Loyalty card), it seems to have some really lovely dynamics.  I suspect that having a bit more context about the card and block distribution would help inform a subsequent play:  but that's something I'd be happy to experience.

This rating could possibly go up with more plays. I am not a wargaming expert by any means, though I've played a few. I think this is my favorite wargame so far. My biggest issue with wargames is the seemingly arbitrary rules and exceptions that are thrown in, not to make the gameplay better, but because it is necessary to reproduce some historical detail. I completely understand this, but too many of these details can really bog down a game for me. Sekigahara is a wargame made with a eurogamer's mentality. It is streamlined and intuitive and yet still gives me the feeling of playing the war it is simulating. I am impressed by the attention to detail in this game and the quickness of the turns. Great game.

RATING: 8
I have the first edition, so my comments relate to that.

At first I was sceptical about the semi-deterministic combat system, but play has reveal that this is a brilliant game. The use of the cards for initiative, movement and combat creates some difficult decisions, as does the need to think about where to concentrate your efforts. You gather your forces, manoeuvre, then commit your armies to battle. You can work out your strength, but you can only (very) roughly estimate how strong you are compared to your opponent. Thus a battle will always be an uncertain affair--just as it should be; what general at that time was able to look at a battle and ensure that each attack had a 5/6 chance of always succeeding? Very tense.

I have a concern about balance, but as we have not yet played the game entirely correctly (as I overlooked a couple of small but key rules), I'm hesitant to say anything. In addition, there's the Second Edition fix, just in case. Replayability might be an issue, but I find that less of a problem given how many games there are to play these days: even if I do ever play this enough to get tired of it, it is so different that it will be nice to have just to pull out for a change in pace.

Sekigahara is an astonishing two-player game. Here we have a wargame that expresses all of its historical flavor through the decision-making process of the player, rather than bolting on a conflict to an established mechanical convention. The ambiguity of unit strength, the constant tension of loyalty, and aggressive pouncing on advantageous situations, all of these things arise organically. This is one of the best wargames I've ever played.

RATING: 6
A kind of combination of Friedrich and Chess, with cards representing factions instead of sections of the board. Fascinating interactions between factions, as you can build up cards/blocks in one for effect, and toss in other clans. 

Loyalty challenges are very powerful, sieges a bit bland, and balance is suspect, but it is a beautiful game, well-conceived, unique. 

At first I stared at the set-up wondering what to do, but it became clear fairly soon, although the tactical options are great. Strategically, it may be more limited. 

Are there other conflicts that could be treated with a similar system?

I like what they've done - replacing unpredictable combat dice with unpredictable card draws, while at the same time making the cards your movement resource.

It's a very abstract simulation with the emphasis on fun. The rules are easy to grasp (except for a few questions regarding mustering and movement within castle areas). Play moves back and forth between players with quick turns. There's a good little element of bluffing and uncertainty with the loyalty cards thrown in for good measure.

The map is a little crowded and blocks will tumble as you look around for various icons.

Overall it's a game about fun. I don't know how many times I can take it for a spin and stay interested with the same simple map. Games tend to play out similarly when compared to other block games like Columbia's Julius Caesar. Variations in setup should mean it keeps coming back to the table for a few plays yet though.

Sekigahara is a breath of fresh air in block war game design.

There is something there, but it is just annoying to look at the board. Constantly searching for red dots and castles over the bulky blocks is tedious. Oh, and there are lots of rules. Sure, once you read them a few times they are understandable and clear, but you'll find yourself going through the rulebook quite often for little things. Also, the gameplay is a bit repetitive. The board is nice, but that's about it. I see this being downgraded with further plays.

RATING: 7.5
Quite good two player block war game.. based on the famouse Japanese battle of Sekigahara between Tokunaga and Ishida clans.  I do like the noble way in which battle is handled and causalities are determined, I do like how even though you have a large army you cannot necessary employ them unless you have the right card.  And how loyalty challenge is determined.  

The card draft and also mustering is pretty interesting as well.  This is actually a pretty simple game, there are limited actions you can take and it's always constrained by the card you have and types of blocks you have in each location.

I did enjoy my first game very much, however because this is actually a quite simple game I do think it takes too long for this type of game.  7 weeks with two actions for each player seems pretty long, and although there are chance that you can finish the game early by killing eachothers leaders or capturing Osaka but I cannot see how that's possible, and in the end it becomes point grabbing by capturing castle and supply areas.  I did enjoy different tensions this game brings, specially in the battle and loyalty challenges but at 3 hours it's way too long.  Perhaps at 2 hours I could enjoy this one more.

The initial impression is great. Waiting to try it out, after reading the rules I estimate that most possibly it's going to take its place in the pantheon of excellent games together with Napoleon's Triumph, Hammer og the Scots, Maria and the rest.

Great game! The rules are fairly simple but pack a lot of game play into a relatively short time. The fog of war nature of the blocks is great, since you need to be able to bluff -- that huge army might be completely useless if you didn't draw the right cards to power it! I really like the card play in the game: you have to manage your hand and cycle cards in order to effectively use your armies. 

The game play was great, but the production could be better:
- the blocks are awesome, much bigger and chunkier than I'd expected; fun to handle
- the blocks are too big for the board! It's difficult to see the locations/roads/castles once you've got pieces in play!
- why isn't there a way to easily track each player's castle and resource totals? do we have to add it up OVER AND OVER?
I want a bigger box (to fit everything back in, properly sorted) and a bigger map (so you can actually see it)! 

Still, very good game!

Incredibly simple and innovative combat system which creates a constant fear of having too much to do with no ability to do it. First game a bit one sided as I got all my loyalty cards and was able to use them and get a very strong board position and opponent resigned on turn 5.

Rating based on one playing, which Ishida won on VPs at game end, 14-13.  He had been losing 19-8 at the start of week 6, so never give up!  Could go up or down based on future plays.  So far, though, we're very impressed!  Lots of things in this game are innovative and unique, well done.  Good tension, reasonably short play time, excellent fog of war - better than most block games due to the cards.  We love the card replenishment mechanic.  Great game!

A very interesting and elegant game.  It models the conflict very closely with hardly any rules.  It is a truly elegant very beautiful design, with gorgeous game piece design.  I love the whole thing, but somehow, it is not quite as tense as some similar games, but very good and I would love for it to break through into main stream gamers who would love this game.  It is not at all for dedicated war gamers.  I only dabble in war games and this is a game that appeals almost as much to the Eurogamer in me as the wargamer, although it is historically accurate.

Simple block wargame themed after the Battle of Sekigahara. Either side can win by killing the enemy leader, but Tokugawa can also do it by capturing Osaka -- quite thematically this seems almost impossible (in real life the city fell some 15 years later). Victory is most likely to be based on points, at the end of the 7th week, for control of castles and resource locations.

Combat is a card-based system where individual blocks must be activated by a card showing the same mon. Subsequent units of the same mon get a bonus for each of those played before them; additionally, riflemen and cavalry activated by a card with a sword symbol get a bonus, which again is increased by all previously played blocks with the same special attack.

The upshot is that uniform armies can be substantially stronger, but also require a much more focused hand of cards -- potentially hard to obtain, and unusable with any other army. 

In theory there's a nice bluffing element to this, but cards are redrawn so often -- including between multiple battles on the same turn -- that luck of the draw has as much of an impact as head-games.

There's a little bit of historical chrome, but not much and not complex. I was surprised at how simple the rules were in this one -- perhaps a little too simple, given the impact of the card draw, but tense and generally enjoyable.

For my money, the most elegant and streamlined strategy war game available. The rules are simple and straightforward but take nothing away from the strategic play. Unit blocks that hide vital stats from your opponent is certainly nothing new, but the card system used in Sekigahara adds an important second layer of uncertainty, bluffing, and resource management that will make you want to play this game over and over.

Loved my first play. The design is a revelation and makes many small, smart decisions that add up to a wonderfully fresh and smooth experience. I want to rate it a 10 but I feel like I need to explore its depths a lot more before I could arrive at that lofty evaluation. I don't think one play is enough for a game like this. High, high hopes and expectations for this one. Feels like it could end up being a top 10 game for me.

RATING: 10
The joy in this game comes from the mechanics.  Every mechanic has a purpose that drives the theme of 16/17th century Japanese warfare.  Most games use mechanics as a way to create a game--Sekigahara uses them to evoke a story and both players are the principle actors.  I rarely feel so engrossed in a game, as if I was there, as I do when Sekigahara is on the table.

RATING: 8
Block wargame depicting the battle of Sekigahara. One player takes the role of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the other Ishida Mitsunari and the play takes place on a point to point map depicting roads, castles, resource spaces and muster points. The game itself is card driven and cards are used to move units and to muster recruitments onto the map. Where the game's originality shines through is during the combat system. Cards are played that have to map the clans present in a battle, otherwise they cannot be used. This is a clever mechanism because it mirrors the situation seen in 1600 where a large part of the problem facing the leaders was in getting the clans to participate in battle. The cards are played, blocks revealed and a running total of the units' strength is kept, the winner being the side who has the most strength. The game is won by either killing an opponent's leader in battle or by control the most resource and castle spaces after the game's set seven turns (representing a week). This is a relatively simple wargame but there is a lot to commend it (presentation is excellent) and the combat mechanism feels genuinely original making it a worthwhile addition to the block wargame genre.

A relatively simple block game where the decision space essentially boils down to:

- do I group large armies together at the (major) expense of movement or have small, swift armies that can deal little damage?

- do I deploy everything I can and hope that my opponent doesn't have a Loyalty Challenge card that I can't respond to?

And yet, I quite enjoyed it. I fear that an early misstep can essentially decide the game early on, but only additional plays will reveal this (as perhaps will better play prevent it).

Update: On a second play both players seemed more competent and the game was a lot more fun and fairly tense. By the end of week 4 most of the battles seemed to have been resolved with one player occupying all of East Honshu and the other the West. It seemed very much that the rest of the game may have come down to snatching castles and resource points whilst trying to avoid major conflict which felt slightly anti-climatic and we agreed on a draw. A wonderfully clever and rules light design though.

Sekigahara was interesting enough that I want to play it a few more times and see if I can actually get good at it. A first pass makes it seem like a lot of your choices are dictated by card draw, and I'm hoping to discover the ways in which experienced players mitigate that.

At the same time this leaves me quite certain that I don't care to delve into any of GMT's deeper titles, given that Sekigahara is on the light end of their catalog (though of course I might still give Twilight Struggle a spin some time).

RATING: 8
Although I can see the thematic reasoning behind not being able to control your troops very well, it does not make for the most entertaining of games. If you get unlucky with the card draw, a single unit of the enemy can defeat an army ten times its size. Sure it is rare, but that kind of game system makes for a less pleasurable experience.

Still definitely an ok game.

Edit: this game and the design ideas behind it has started to grow on me. Rating increased.

I have never managed to win this, but it's still enjoyable.  It's a fairly chaotic game (tempted to say totally chaotic, but perhaps I just don't get the strategy yet), you have to learn to go with the cards and manage the draw as best you can.  I get the feeling that stacks of blocks from the same clan form the best armies (i.e. that the synergy in combat strength outweighs the chance of pulling a hand with no matching cards)

The designer keeps his word and creates an austere, elegant ruleset that captures the essential elements of the topic.

The matching of block Mons to cards recalls Friedrich/Maria, in that force strength is dependent on an independent variable, but this takes that concept in a new direction.

Production value is also notable - minimalist, stylized, and attractive.

Brilliant Game. Combines elements of great games. Creates the incredible tension of pushing your stack into another stack that you get in a war game, that dreadful feeling . . . with no dice.

Which was a dangerous time for two rival lords with uncertain loyalty from their vassals. Fascinating story, fascinating game.

I don't know what to think of this game.

On one hand, it seems to have everything I want from a wargame (elegance, historical flavour, great components). The designer notes alone convinced me the game was up to something.

But, after having played 1 and a half game, I'm not so sure I appreciate it :
- The game is so abstracted I don't feel the narrative of the campaign
- The sieges are too deterministic. Was there no chance for the attackers to lose troops ?
- The game is unplayable on VASSAL, not only because of the card system but also because you lose track of the turn you are in
- It doesn't click for me. I don't feel I am Tokugawa or his opponent. I don't feel the strategy that's best.

Maybe it will change with more plays, but for now, I'm strangely dissatisfied

RATING: 9
- Recreates the uncertainty and tension during war
- Game play duration is relatively short (for being a wargame)
- Game rules are quite simple to understand except that there may be nitty gritty rules to remember about the combat.
- Replayability is high as each game feels different, depending on the initial setup, cards drawn and tiles drawn during the game
- Tough decisions may be required such as planning which armies to dispatch to which location based on your assessment of the risk involved and cards on hand, deciding which card to play to determine turn order (which may be important) and whether you would want to keep that "family" for your future combat. Furthermore, card has to be discarded if a player wish to move more armies around the board. A wrong move can be pretty devastating. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I think there is a genius in the mechanics of the game that produces fantastic tension, uncertainty while reducing luck, planning that must incorporate the psychology of bluff & empathy. You have full information of what your potentials are, but partial information of your opponents. This enmeshes the players in a one-on-one game of skill that relies on intuiting the opponents potentials & will, and incorporates the drama of contingency without a single die. 

One mechanic I'll mention here: at the end of each round, which is two pulses of moves and combats, you must discard 1/2 your hand (rounded up in the players favor). In this one rule several sorts of thematic & mechanical notions cohere: 

1) The game is about a 7 week war. The mechanic thrusts you into acting, as what you have in hand and can plan is a short window of certainty, so this isn't a game to turtle and hang around waiting to be reactive to a tactical condition thrust upon you by the other. [u]This is a game that forces you to act to preempt the contingency of the upcoming discard.[/u] Therefore, conflict forcing commitment is immediate. You are thrown into circumstances you didn't choose, but the burden of responsibility for outcomes are on you. Damn, it's an existentialist's dream game.

2) The simplicity of this mechanic serves the subject well - a war defined by such uncertainty in command & control - without adding chrome & complexity. This same historical modeling [i]with simplicity rather than chrome[/i] also creates an intense state of mind in the compressed gameplay a simpler game offers. Because it maintains a need for skill in hand management as well as empathy (reading the other, applying tension, etc) to survive. So as players, your personal investment is very high. You don't have the dice or the unknown as far as your forces and their motivations: ie. on the board, your blocks, and in your hand, your cards, are 100% viewable information and calculable potentials. [u]The opponent is the one directing uncertainty. You don't get any mechanical buffers between the two of you.[/u]

3) Because of the discards, your opponent is suffering uncertainty; they can't project your behavior so well. Nothing is truly safe, the thinking incorporates fuzzy potentials. This is such a rich environment for memorable bluffs & thematic coherence. 

4) The discard system helps force a unique tempo & narrative to the game flow. Despite the relative compression of this historical war into a tight timeline, this card mechanic as well as the variable set-up guarantee a unique narrative to each game. 

5) There is significant skill in hand management driven by the discard. You can't sit & wait and build the perfect hand, but you do carry over more than 1/2 your hand to set up a Strateg. This mechanic enables learning a sort of patience, and moments of sacrifice and attrition, to succeed. It heightens awareness as it increases the tactical richness offered by change. [u]The contingencies it forces offer a meaningful experience when you play.[/u] 

6) Because this game gives you choices (ie: you can play all or none of your cards in a turn), without the discard rule it would become easy to save up a massive hand and do what you want without the constraint. The game would become more comfortable, but I'm not sure it would be as interesting as the resultant slugfest rather than a sequence of difficult choices, the challenge of thinking under duress, & psychological shading. 

This is just one mechanic. The innovations of the design has other constituents. The game is unique. It challenges any bias of Euro-privilidge as the bastion of innovation and simple rulesets.

Wow!  What a design.  Loads of interesting decisions.  The hand management requires serious board play and risk mitigation.  Best combat in any game I've played ever by a large margin.  Very exciting and tense.  Well selected small forces with the right cards can beat out big stacks.  Hidden cards and hidden unit types means any battle no matter the size of the armies could go either way.  Great room for posturing and bluffing.  A big game of chicken.  Does he have the card for that army that he's just camped on this castle / resource or is it a show of force trying to discourage me from attacking when he doesn't have the cards?

RATING: 7
This is a beautiful wargame. It's sort of a block game, like Command and Colors, but the troops are secret and aren't revealed to your opponent until they engage you in battle. Fights are card driven, so when two army stacks meet on the point-to-point map, each player takes turns playing cards and deploying the matching armies to the battlefield. A big army stack means more options, but not necessarily a big fighting force, since a player can't actually deploy a block that is present unless they hold a matching card. This creates an amazing fog of war, as well as a ton of opportunities to bluff and push-your-luck. 

There is also an interesting bribe mechanism. When a battle is being resolved, certain cards can be played that challenge the loyalty of a newly deployed army. If the challenged player can't produce a second card that matches that army, it flips and joins the opponent. In practice it doesn't happen all that often, but the fact that it can happen creates all sorts of tension and hand management issues, making every battle a nail-biting experience.

Sekigahara is a very challenging (brain-burning) lighter wargame.  The card driven game play requires stringing together a number of decisions because cards are required for initiative, combat, movement, and mustering.  Having to discard half of one's hand every week is often excruciating.  The map is fairly simple and leads to some immediate conflicts.  How predictable these early conflicts are remains to be seen.  The starting setup is largely scripted, but also also includes random selection of reserve blocks and card draws.  The card play loosely reminds me of Maria, but with the cards associated with factions (Sekigahara) rather than locale (Maria).  An easy-to-learn, hard-to-master game with a beautiful presentation.

Brilliant game--a near-perfect implementation of theme and mechanics, where the high-strategic view and card-play merges seamlessly.  Playing cards to commit troops burns through morale and lowers legitimacy--but enemy atrocities builds up your side's willingness to battle once again.  Wrapped within the honour system of feudal Japan, it all comes together in a beautiful, tense and fun game.

Card driven block war game. The trick centers around managing your stacks of secret units that require the proper hand management to properly activate them in combat. Bluff with big troop stacks. The opponent must measure if it is an effective grouping of units, and do you have the cards to execute? Or run a small tactical group. Luck of the draw is a factor. Stratego on steroids.

Sekigahara's upstart departure from other block game systems is refreshing.  The [i]cards[/i] are the thing, not the blocks, and the one-upsmanship combat procedure found elsewhere (cf. Friedrich) is refined and possibly perfected.

As far as rules depth and learnability, Sekigahara is truly an introductory game of war strategy.  But simple doesn't mean simple-minded.  The game manages to capture the sway of field and siege battles, while also rewarding advanced planning - and all in a way that doesn't intimidate new grognards.  Everything is quick, clean, and an immediate rush.

Plus there are mechanical frills - mostly focusing on card management - that keep everything orderly and thoughtful, and dashes of Far East flavor contribute to the experience.

A minor complaint is that block secrecy will wane as the game wears on, though some would argue that knowing the identities of particular blocks in Sekigahara may not be a major concern.  When the merry-go-round hits the brass ring, the only thing that matters is whether your enemy's cards match his intent - since blocks that are present can't necessarily be deployed.

So do pay attention to the number of your cards in your opponent's hand, and if possible scout for Loyalty Challenges in the reflection in your opponent's glasses.  My record defense against a loyalty assault?  An opponent played three of the four possible Tokugawa LC cards against my golden hordes in an all-or-nothing battle in Kiso.  And yes, I deflected them all.  So, for now, the golden Sun continues to rise over the land of my honored ancestors.

Final Note:

It's unfortunate that players not wanting their heads to explode are forced to read the posted rules clarifications on sieges, group movement, and mustering into battle.  The rules [i]are[/i] easy.  They just aren't all there.

For the sake of wargaming posterity, I hope the living rules are updated sooner rather than later.

A current top 5 boardgame. A wargame with euro quality components. Playability, depth, theme, eye candy. Best combination of these qualities I have come across.

Surprisingly smooth playing for a game with some unique mechanisms.  Speaking of which, the requirement that you have the proper cards in hand to activate your various forces is a brilliant fit for the theme of the game.  Same with the switching sides mechanic.  Early games have run about 2 hours, but it zips right by.  The design and historic notes in the rulebook are excellent.

Very thematic implementation of the Battle of Sekigahara. Fog of war and hand management mechanics are combined really well to give a tense game experience from the start till the end. Player interaction, both direct and indirect, is very high. Key to playing well is good hand management of cards, some bluffing, controlling key locations and timely use of the loyalty challenge.

Artwork is very Japanese and looks great while game component quality is very high, e.g. thick card stock. The only downside is parts of the game board information tends to get covered by the blocks, making it slightly difficult for beginners of the game.

Very good block game.  A nice change from the typical and getting old Columbia block game.  Rules are simple, but strategy is high.  One concern is that the game seems to play out fairly similar each time so far.

Played two games (one for each side) and have to admit this being as one of the best 2player wargames. 

What I like about the game is that the random element is delivered through the recruitment and card drawing, but once it is done (and it comes to the events on the map), players know the situation they are in and battles are less random (to compare with the games involving dice during battles). 

This is a very big plus for the game from my point of view. A solid 9 from me after 2 games! Love it. 
Light wargame, but still a brain burner at times. 

Still one has to take into consideration, that I've won both times I played, which always makes me rate higher than in normal circumstances. :)

Best block game doesn't come from Columbia. Evocative minimalistic design, tense area influence of sort, stupendous study in one particular historical campaign accompanied with best designer and historical notes EVAR. Highly immersive and satisfying combat.

No hay tanta desesperaci√≥n como en el Mar√≠a pero dura s√≥lo una hora y media; tenso, con una presencia en la mesa desgarradora. 

La traici√≥n y el enga√±o son las herramientas con las que someter a tu rival. A trav√©s de ellas dirige a miles de guerreros por jap√≥n, enfrent√°ndolos en batallas y sitios.  

Actualizaci√≥n:

Tus ojos se mover√°n nerviosos de tu mano al tablero. Tratar√°s de emparejar tu escasez de cartas en cuanto a n√∫mero con las vastas posibilidades que te ofrece el invertirlas para mover a tus tropas, llamar a refuerzos o batallar ¬°C√≥mo impone ver las columnas de los ej√©rcitos de Tokugawa! Movi√©ndose por carreteras, comprometiendo tus pasos y asfixiando a tus lejanos castillos, demasiado distantes de tus fuentes de tropas y de tus intereses principales. 

Algunos de ellos los dejas en silencio a su suerte. No lo dices en voz alta pero sabes que sus guarniciones est√°n perdidas. No les enviar√°s a ning√∫n refuerzo y semanas antes de que que caigan esos castillos ya has decidido traicionarles; presenciar√°s mirando hacia otro lado su lenta agon√≠a. Pero los clanes que se muestran leales a ti tambi√©n estar√°n dispuestos a abandonarte cuando m√°s los necesites. Os animo a ver la pel√≠cula de Ran para visualizar la crudeza, drama e ira que puede generar esto.

Despu√©s de la masacre y posiblemente de vuestra retirada, los traidores os volver√°n a jurar una lealtad de la misma consistencia que la anterior.  Los sentir√°s ajenos a tu causa, culpables de tu derrota y a√∫n as√≠ los aceptar√°s porque los necesitas.

Siendo Ishida Mitsunari partiste de Osaka oculto a las tropas de Tokugawa Ieyasu. Tomaste las riendas de 40.000 soldados y dejaste a tu hijo en casa, lejos de la crueldad de la guerra. Te ocupaste de tomar los recursos que necesitabas, de espantar a los ej√©rcitos menores y de huirle al enemigo all√≠ donde era fuerte. Pero no contaste con llegar a un punto donde regresar se volviese imposible, tal vez por el bloqueo de otro ej√©rcito mayor o por el riesgo que supondr√≠a abandonar ese punto estrat√©gico.

Y entonces ves c√≥mo el fan√°tico Tokugawa Ieyasu entra en Osaka, donde est√° tu hijo solo y apenas defendido, buscando tu cabeza para poner fin a un drama que ya cuenta con demasiados miles de muertos. Has llevado refuerzos pero no son suficientes. Podr√≠as hacer una ataque desesperado por levantar el sitio, pero tan pronto como la monta√±a de tu ej√©rcito se mueve, el resto de enemigos lo hace contigo. 

No hay palabras para describir la sensaci√≥n que produce el cuadro que se dibuja sobre el tablero, lleno de columnas negras y un flaco reducto amarillo en Osaka, en una √©pica batalla donde sabes hasta d√≥nde puedes apostar pero donde no puedes poner la mano en el fuego por la lealtad de ninguno de los que se hacen llamar tus hombres.

No hace falta vender la buena presencia que desprende Sekigahara en todos sus componentes pero s√≠ que os animo a que redonde√©is la experiencia con una buena banda sonora, como la de la pel√≠cula de Ran de manos del compositor T≈çru Takemitsu.

Cuando pierdo me quedo sin habla y me dan ganas de salir de casa con los ojos desorbitados, gritando: Saburo, Saburo...

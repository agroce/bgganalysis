More of the same kind of game as Cardline: Animals where you are just ordering things.  This time, it's countries (population, square miles, GDP, environmental impact) and it work like the other game.  It just doesn't work as well with younger kids.

RATING: 4
Might be my least favorite of the cardline series (and I love geography). But GDP and Carbon emissions are really wonky things to know. (per capita income might be better)

Seriously... CO2 Emissions in US Tons is one of the statistics presented in the game...

Not nearly as good as the orginal title in the series.

Cardline is very good alternative for timeline.
It is good change to have four factors that we could use to play. In the other hand they are either easy to remember or more abstract than historical dates and therefore no so nice to play with.

This is a great little educational game that has more replayability than its Timeline relatives.  Each of the 100 or so country cards that come with it has 4 attributes: land area, population, GDP, and amount of carbon emissions.  Before a game, one of these attributes is chosen as the one being compared between each country card played.  Each person attempts to play out their hand of cards by correctly guessing where the country belongs as it compares to cards already out on the table in a line of least to greatest.  The artwork is great.  It's harder than it looks.

Another simple comparison quiz game similar to Anno Domini or Timeline, but with for different geographical topics this time. While it works fine rules-wise, the cards in this edition vary wildly in difficulty thus making it a lot less balanced than most of the time-based games of this sort I've seen.

My feelings about the Timeline gameform are lukewarm but definitely positive. This adds an element of "wait, I don't care" when played with any stat other than population; maybe the other stats should have been per capita? I dunno, a game of Timeline that drags on because people keep failing to realize how much stuff happened before 1878 is at least interesting. A game of Cardline that drags on because people fail to realize how many countries have less than 78,000 square miles of area rather than more... not so interesting.

Trivia games are not games, they are [url=http://www.human-memory.net/types_declarative.html]non-interactive skill[/url]  contests, played on an uneven field, which are fun for equally matched players/teams, but usually devolve into which team gets lobbed more softball questions in their weakest category, à la Trival Pursuit. Great for finding the Rain Man in your social group.

Good game. For some reason I enjoy it more than the Animals Cardline game, but I still prefer the Timeline series. Love that the stat for CO2 emissions was included. Other than that I suck at this game but I plan to play it from time to time. 

As a standalone game, it has more replayability than any of its cousins as there now 4 stats per card.

I’m tired of the whole Cardline series of games. My desire to play any of them is very low so I’m downgrading its rating accordingly. 

I already sold my copy of the game.

Recycles the sort mechanism from Anno Domini and Timeline, making it even simpler. Really light, really fast and potentially unbalanced when players get cards of highly varying difficulty to place (sort Russia by square kilometers). Nonetheless, a very good filler game I enjoy as a geography nut.

A game to order countries by land size or population. Like Cardline Dinosaurs, this devolves into a guessing game, but I rank this higher, only because it seems more educational, and when you get an answer right/wrong you have an "ah-ha" moment.

It's a trivia game, basically, but the shtick of ordering cards makes it play out smoothly. Having four different parameters gives its a bit more replayability than Timeline.

Similar to Cardline: Animals, I like how there are a few different ways to play this game - population density, GDP (I think), geographic size, and maybe one more. Cute game. Good for kids too. Good family game. Art work borderlines on a bit racist though.

A very simple, quick, and educational yet it is still entertaining. Obviously the comparisons to timeline has to be made.  This game gives you four choices of category (population, area, GDP and Tons of CO2 emissions)These categorizes are really difficult but very interesting.    Good for a short filler game

facts about the world in 2011 just don't have the feeling of grounded truth that anybody should care about, so I just don't like this as much as the animal based cardline game.

Keeping it simple makes this little country comparison game good with kids as long as you're willing to boost the educational aspect of the game and drop a few hints. You compare one of four characteristics between countries in an attempt to make a legal placement and place all your cards. We've seen the mechanic in other games like Anno Domini, or Ausgerechnet Buxtehude and this is another nice version. With 110 countries the kids and sometimes even the adults learn some interesting little snippets about countries including on what continent they're located, area (in miles squared unfortunately - maybe I'll pick up the metric version), populations, GDP and CO2 production. Educational without sticking it in your face. There's a few annoying typos and some of the graphics assigned to countries are downright lazy generic choices.

Harder than the Animals version because the numbers can be really surprising, especially the carbon emissions stat because it's per capita, so it depends on your estimate of population in addition to pollution.

I love the Cardline line of card games (see what I did here?) but the Globetrotters edtion unfortunately falls a little short. The problem? Unlike historical dates, most of which will not change ever again, most of the stats in this game are subject to change every year and the further away from the years 2011 and 2012 (which is what the stats are based on), the bigger the variance. One of the draws of the Cardline games is that you are actually learning something while playing, but here you will be learning things, which are getting more obsolete by the year. A good example in our game was the GDP of Greece, which was surprisingly huge compared to some other European countries, but then again it was based on stats from 2011 and we all know by know that the stats of Greece during those years were falsified to put it mildly. The game can still be enjoyed, since the sizes of countries will probably not change and even the relative sizes of populations, GDP and pollution will most likely stay the same for years to come, even if the actual stats will change. However, coupled with the fact that this game is not compatible with all the other (historical date) Cardline games, I will have to let it go.

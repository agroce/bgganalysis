Probably the best game out there that will be enjoyed equally by young children and adults. Definitely not a strategic game, but an excellent tactical filler. Gobs of luck, but Luck will, nevertheless, reward the player who knows best when to stop and when to press on.

RATING: 6.5
I dunno if I would ever play this over the similar Incan Gold except for the cute components factor... there's some neat stuff going on with stacking your chips, and the different valuations of different animals? But in a game as light as this I'm not sure throwing more math at it makes it better.

{many plays • 3-6 players} Fun to pull stuff from a bag, and I always appreciate a press-your-luck game, but it's a little too easy to fall behind with no real hope of catching up... and then you're just watching others play, even if it is a fairly quick game.

RATING: 5.5
Okay push-your-luck game, but not as good as Circus Flohcati because you can loose everything in this game.  If you happen to have your stack built in just the right sequence, you can get cleaned out by the other players in just a few turns where you failed to draw a rare animal (i.e. elephant, giraffe, etc.).  Okay every so often, but not the best of the push-your-luck genre.

RATING: 6
A cute filler which boils down to a simple math game.

8 categories of animals, numbered 3-10.
Draw until you stop or draw a duplicate.
If you match the top of someone else's stack, you steal it.
If you draw a monkey, you can match or swap the monkey for someone else's chip.

Play to the end of the bag.

Each chip is +1 point. If you have majority of any given chip type, you get bonus points equal to the number of that chip type in the bag (3 for 3, 4 for 4, etc).

RATING: 2
Another in the long line of Knizia's heavy-mathy games. Set collection mixes with a press-your-luck mechanism that's been done to death. There's an extra layer with the titular simian that allows you to muck things up, but not enough for me to care. Pass.

This is a very light, quick game. We're starting to play it during dinner as the poker chip-like pieces can't easily be ruined with food (though the cardboard animal squares can). It's a silly, fun push your luck game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Neat cross between Circus Flohcati (drafting cards) and Pickomino (stacking and protecting your scoring chips) with a little more to offer than Flohcati.  A great push-your-luck mechanic in that you'll want to keep drawing chips for an amazing turn, but might end up losing it all if you go too far!

The chips really add a great tactile feel to the game; a great choice by the publisher!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A push your luck collection game where you collect sets of animals in a stack. If you draw the same animal as one you have already drawn on your go then you put all the animals back in the bag. Earn bonus points for having the most of each different animal in your stack. Nice quick filler. 10 Plays.

RATING: 6
Nice animal-chips, thick majority cards, but not much of a game in here. Very light filler, and too much of a Zirkus Flohcati remix for my taste.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Super light, super random, super frustrating when you can't draw what you need! 

This one is pretty simple, and the kids seem to like it pretty well. Draw a tile, and if it matches what your opponent has, you get to take theirs. Push your luck, and you may putting them all back. There's a tiny bit of strategy when you decide to keep or draw again, but it's very VERY light.

RATING: 6
40+ plays (20x3p, 6x4p, 3x5p, 10x6p, 1x7p) -- A quick and easy game with meaningful decisions, interaction, and nice chunky bits, and not much else, but does it need more? It's great to have a game that you can just sit down and start playing.  One group I play with has established a loud declaration of "RESOURCE ALLOCATION!" when a player is stacking the earned chips, before the next player can begin--saying it in an exaggerated accusatory way if the next player neglects to wait... and somehow this has turned into a ridiculous tradition of false-soprano singing on the resource allocation theme. Thus if you can bring the extra fun to the game, that is a lovely time. However, I can see it sometimes falling a little flat. So I think this is a solid game, not a favorite, but a good filler to keep in the circulation. Some of my friends do request it, too. PS: Dingo ate yer baby.

My son Nathan, age 5, wanted this game after playing it a few times at the Laurel game club. I can't believe how lucky he is at it. He can usually pull 5 or 6 different animals from the bag where I am lucky to get 3. He regularly beats me.

I'll play this again for sure at some point. The new 2013 version of Cheeky Monkey comes in an actual stuffed monkey to pull your chips out of its rear end. Pretty funny idea! I'll keep my hand out of the monkey butt though. I like the original boxed version of the game (but it's difficult to find now).

I believe this was designed as a children's game, but it's also a surprisingly good filler that most adults who don't take themselves too seriously will enjoy. Lots of press-your-luck and a certain amount of take that. As a result, there's plenty of room for a changing leader and lots of forehead slapping when you lose your chips from either getting too greedy or falling victim to those naughty enemy monkeys.

RATING: 7.3
I love this game for what it subtly teaches my kids: the art of push-your-luck. It's fun for me because it's fun for them and I enjoy playing it with them. Yes, I always try to play "skillfully" and never stack the same animals underneath each other, but it never helps. But I've noticed my kids picking up on that little strategy and I love watching them learn. This game makes those observations even more enjoyable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Over thirty plays, with between two and seven players. A great light game for both kids and adults. The bonus points are significant, so remembering what chips you've already taken will inform your decisions as to whether or not to continue drawing chips from the bag; for example, if you've collected a few kangaroos and your opponents are showing kangaroos on the tops of their stacks, you might want to risk drawing more chips to see if you can turn up another kangaroo and get a windfall. Remembering what is in your stack will also help you decide whether or not to use the cheeky monkey's special ability to exchange tiles. The rule that you can bury your chips at the bottom if they're all of one type also adds a hair more strategy; this allows players to stop immediately after a big windfall instead of being forced to keep going to cover their booty with a different type of chip. It also makes the end game a lot less chaotic.

All in all, this is a fun and clever game. It might be too light for gamers, but it's perfect for families who want something that's simple enough for the kids to be involved but which still has a little something to think about.

Csintalan majmocskák
Barátoméknál, Janiéknál sikerült kipróbálnom ezt az egyszerű kis játékot, amelyet utána „jóárasítva” meg is vettem. A „miért”-em egyszerű volt, olyan játékot kerestem, amely könnyen tanítható, 4-nél többen is játszható, rövid játékidejű és gyerekek részére könnyen megtanulható, élvezetes móka. Itt mindez találkozik. Alapból nem egy haladó, tapasztalt társasjátékos részére készült, azonban bevezető vagy levezető játéknak, családi szórakozásnak tökéletes. A játékosok a különböző számú állatkerti lakókat (ezeket zsetonok jelképezik aranyos grafikával) gyűjtögetik a játék folyamán egy zsákból húzva. Mindenki bátorságának (taktikájának) megfelelően húz  belőle addig a pillanatig, amikor megáll vagy két egyforma élőlény kerül a birtokába. Első esetben a kihúzott korongokat elveszi és maga elé helyezi egy oszlopban, a második esetben mindent visszatesz a zsákba. Majd továbbadja a következő játékosnak a húzózacsit. A játékot két szabálya emeli az átlag fölé. Egyik, hogy zsetonokat rabolhatsz a többiektől, a másik, hogy a húzott majmocskát kicserélheted más játékos zseton oszlopának legfelső korongjára. A játékban elég nagy a szerencse szerepe, aki az elején elhúz, már behozhatatlan előnyre tesz szert. Mindezek ellenére jó szívvel ajánlom, főleg a társasokkal ismerkedő (kis)gyermekes családok részére. Kedves párom játszott az éppen akkor 6 hónapos gyermekünkkel is, úgy, hogy neki ő maga húzott és a csöppség nyert. :)

I really enjoy this animal-themed filler. This is a push-your-luck game with just a little bit of player interaction. Easy to grasp the rules immediately, good with big groups (even more than the 6 player "max") and yet enough depth that just a play or two won't show you all there is to offer. In that way, it's a bit reminiscent of other Kniza fillers like Poison and King of the Beasts. The stuffed monkey is really silly and unneeded, and a pain to put on the shelf. Find an old version if you can.

Wee! This "Zirkus Flohcati"-like filler is quite a lot of fun with a neat changing strategy as the bag gets more empty. It's a bit tough for those who fail get a foothold, but it plays fast enough so you can play another round

Mar09: Does exactly what it sets out to do.  A good "push-your-luck" game for 3-6 players.  Turns go fast and you usually pay attention because they may steal your chips.  You want to know what everyone draws!

How much luck is there?  A ton.  Someone usually gets away with a great steal for the win.  But there's still meaningful decisions every turn.

And for the kids?  Well there's educational content on the back of the tiles :P

I do recommend this one.  I like Circus Flohcati better, but this one goes faster and is easier to explain.

One of the better light push-yr-luck games. My family is fond of them, so I feel like I'm becoming a connoisseur. This one has an added streak of nastiness that allows you to steal chips from other players. Push your luck games are played primarily against the draw rather than your opponenents. This one has an added layer of interactivity that bumps it a notch up.

This is a light filler. It has a fun push-your-luck mechanic which can lead to a lot of really fun moments when the game just turns against you. There are some decisions and thought buried in the game if you want to pay attention to them.

Awesome press-your-luck filler. Simple mechanics but has some dynamic excitement. The Cheeky Monkey rule feels kind of like a double down, and the animal herd rule offers an opportunity to manage your luck. The poker chip pieces offer a satisfying tactile experience. I think this game can fill a similar niche for me as For Sale does.

Feels similar to Circus Flohcati, but I like the feel of the chips.  Drawing from a bag, it makes it feel even more push your luck (like Ra, I guess).  It's a relatively simple game, fun to play.  I'm not sure how well it would go over with kids though, mainly due to the constant theft.  But it's probably so common that it wouldn't be a problem.

Solid family game that's both random and subtle. It's a push your luck game with majority scoring (you want the most of an animal to get the bonus token). Also want to keep track of what animals may be left in the bag lest you bust. Remember to hide your good chips under your pile when possible and try to use the monkeys cleverly. The stuffed animal edition where you're pulling guts out the monkey's back is super cute.

[b]Cheeky Monkey[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]Cheeky Monkey was a fun, push your luck filler. You are trying to gain majorities of the different animal types in order to score points, but draw two of the same animal and you bust. The components were nice and added to the appeal of the game, especially the chunky plastic tokens. 

Cheeky Monkey would make for a great family game, but it doesn't stand from the crowd enough for me to be interested in owning a copy.That said I would be happy to play again if it came out at another meet up.[/i]

RATING: 7
Played once more with adults and something like 4 times with my 4-year-old (using several rules mods to make the game simpler). A solid filler that you can't take too seriously since it is possible for bad luck to knock someone out of the race without them being able to do much about it. On the plus side, the run of back luck required to do this is pretty extreme - which means that it shouldn't happen too often.

Another Perfect Game. It can be played anywhere, even non-gaming environments. Sure, it's a learning game for children but who doesn't need to be brushed up on where dingoes and warthogs originate? The game's simple, yet brilliant mechanic of push-your-luck meets set collection is nothing short of brilliant and is always great fun in a group, no matter how large, no matter the ages. Fantastic game and I always take it with me.

RATING: 4
It's fine, but it pales against Zirkus Flohcati in the push-your-luck genre because the turns are so slow. You can generate fun egging people on, but it's more getting your egging in and having your turn within 15 seconds rather than waiting a minute which is the case here.

"Push-your-luck filler, with a bit of stealing and some majority scoring."

What I like:

- I'm not fond of majority-based scoring
- Strong memory aspect
- Stealing chips

Update update: Shopping and stopping in this game is no longer fun, I think because it isn't as thematic or dramatic as another push-your-luck game I repurchased: Diamant, even though playing time is in Cheeky Monkeys favour. I think overall the negative vibe of intentional stealing when opportunity arises just diminishes the schadenfreude. For such a simple game even after some time I need to refer to the rules regarding the monkey options and other fiddly rules re matching and herding. Either this is indicative of rules not being intuitive, and inconsistent as variants remove certain animals and rules or my mind is going, but it may well be indicative that it doesn't get played that often plus again there is no intuitive mnemonic for rules to 'stick' as there is no thematic narrative.  Time to let this animal go free and just stick with cave exploring for impulse control.

Update: Recent play and I still find it fun in a schadenfreude way (thankfully tempered by blind draws), but I feel the end game scoring (as always) lacks drama so may consider first to compare piles the smallest being scored zero and the next tallest scoring the difference. Then work out the majorities, so pen and paper may be required.

Not so typical push-your-luck style game in that not only do you wish to take another turn to make gains at the risk of losing all amassed in your turn, but there is the additional incentive to take another turn to protect your gains from being "stolen". This is because the chips gained when you choose to stop can be arranged on top of stack in any order, so probability decisions need to made as to how you should stack to reduce the stealing which in this game can be produce dramatic swings in fortune as well as schaudenfreude. Another element of interest is that as tiles get thrown back in the bag for bombing out, gradually the contents of what's left consolidates and the probability decisions become easier. Interesting and fun for such a simple ruleset.

What a surprise, Knizia rips himself off again. Now he's taken Circus Flohcati  and Pickomino and crammed them together.  I will say that he's done it for the better, in that I think this game is far superior to the previous two, but I can't help feeling like I'm being sold some snake oil here.  Another game churned out from the Knizia factory.

Bitching aside, it is a fine enough push-your-luck filler.  A game that I would never have a problem playing.  It's simple and accessible, and works well.  Nothing new, but nothing not to like.

What a fun game!  My kids love it.  Very nice pieces.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This game feels VERY similar to Circus Flohcati. There are 8 species of animals (on poker chips) which occur 3-10 times. These are mixed in the bag. On your turn, you draw chips 1 at a time until either you decide to stop (add the chips in any order to your stack of chips) or bust (get a duplicate animal). If you bust, the chips go back in the bag and the next player takes their turn. The twists vs. Circus Flohcati:
- if you draw an animal that matches the one on top of any player's stack, you get to take all those matching chips
- the Cheeky Monkey (#10) is special: it can either play as above (take matching monkeys) or be "cheeky" - trade with the top chip of any other player's stack.
- if your entire collection of chips is 1 species (e.g., drew a monkey and took all matching monkeys) you can bury it at the bottom of your stack.
- "busts" are not discarded, but returned to the bag.
- at end of game (run out of chips in bag), players get 1 VP per chip, plus a bonus for whoever controls the majority of each animal (VP = total # of that animal in the game, i.e., 3-10).

I think Circus is a decent game, but it's not one I'd like to play all the time. It is, however, a good filler. After one play I may like this more, except that I'd like it to end faster: it seemed a bit long since there is no discard pile. But the artwork (final version is here) looks great, the chips feel good, and if you're a fan of Circus you should definitely check this out.

I bought this to play with my 5 year old. It's a fun family game, not too complicated, but not to simple to bore adults.

Time: 20 mins
Mechanic: Push your luck

Randomly select animal tiles from a bag. Draw as many as you want but if you draw doubles all tiles go back into the bag.

(Yes, I have the version with the stuffed monkey bag, yes it is as awkward as you think it will be)

Nem csalódtam. Látatlanban vettem meg (azaz nem is olvastam róla). Egész egyszerűen bíztam a tervező nevében:) És bejött. Nagyszerű gyerekjáték:) És ezt már 1 játék után is bátran állíthatom

Cute and very light, with an extremely high luck factor tempered by the fact that the game is quick. Decent filler but, despite my usual Knizia-worship, probably not one with huge replayability or that I need to own.

Really fun filler with excellent components.  Lots of fun with the right group - a push-your-luck collection game that can be a real laugh!

A nice balance of strategy and luck, playable by just about any age - I got beaten by a four-year-old on my 10th play!

I no longer think it's the luck-fest I originally thought. Of course there's luck in the draw, but skillful management of that will usually put you in contention. I still think it's too long for what it is. Perhaps taking out one or two animals would help. Funny, my 9 & 5 year-old nieces didn't think it dragged. They are entertained throughout- it's me that gets a bit bored.

Funny components, looks like a kids game but on nice poker chips, funny facts on the back of cards.  Nice twist to a push your luck game, very accessible.  I liked it as a quick filler but not really enough to get my own copy.

Fun, fast, and light.  A great filler game - and one where you don't have to think too much.  Definitely a lot more fun with animated players who trash talk and egg each other on.

A very enjoyable push-your-luck game with fun player interaction. The uneven distribution of the various animals and the majority fights add interest, and the cheeky monkeys are a nice twist.

RATING: 6
This is pretty much a standard push-your-luck game with drawing from a bag replacing rolling the dice.  Like Pickomino and its ilk, the "push too far" element is matching what you've already drawn, and the game also allows players to steal from other players by matching tiles, or swapping when drawing the monkey tile.    There are some neat tactical decisions to make based on the distribution of the animal chips and the balance factor of swapping the monkey chips at the risk of giving the chosen player a majority in those chips.  It's a straightforward game that can be played with kids, but it has enough going on to make it more than just a mindless exercise in drawing tiles.

Missing one boar and one monkey chip, but it doesn't change playability.  The rest of the game is in great shape, including the box.

Screwy late-night fun for all ages.  Suitable also as a daytime filler.

Knizia employs the same "flip over a matching symbol, lose your turn" mechanic in Circus Flohcati, but I don't care.  Both are worth owning and playing.

Played once (with 6 players). A push-your-luck filler, which might be, just like Heckmeck, too long for what it is.

RATING: 7.5
Very simple to play - good with kids as young as 4 when you play with simpler rules.

A little bit of screwage. Great components! Overall a nice family game.

Rating assumes playing with children. With only adults, this is probably a 6.

This is more fun than drawing chips from a bag should be.  It is a great quick game for a larger group of people.  It travels supremely well also.

Generally I love push-your-luck games, and this one is the best of them imo. To see your friends draw two elephants out of the bag is great fun, and it makes me laugh every time. The monkey is a nice twist to the game, as you have the chance to swap it with any other player's top tile.

RATING: 7
It's a blast if you don't overplay it or try to take it seriously. The stack-sorting element (which animal you place on top of your stack) and the monkey's special ability keep it from being pure luck. Additionally, the bonus tokens require good players to keep track of everyone's stacks. This game goes just as well with families as with my hardcore gamer friends.

RATING: 6
Is it fun?  It depends on if you're the one getting screwed (by drawing identical animals or getting them stolen too often) or if it's happening to someone else.  Is it short?  It depends on whether people are playing conservatively or pushing their luck too much.  Is it truly a filler?  It depends on if the game runs so long that it overstays its welcome.  

Do you sense a pattern here (I'll give you a hint, the word "depends")?  There is just way too much randomness, both in the experience and in the mechanic itself, to make Cheeky Monkey anything but an average game.  I don't dislike it, but I'm definitely not a fan.

missing rules, draw bag, and 2 poker chips... so, beware when buying things used. :/  Still, great game.

After 5+ Plays: One of my favorite fillers, though I have trouble convincing others of its brilliance.  The intersection of set collection and push-your-luck works really well, because there is more to think about than just how many tiles to stop at.

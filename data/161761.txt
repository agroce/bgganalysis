GAME: King's Gold
RANK: 4732
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Small dice rolling game with very cool components. The gameplay is very simple and it's nothing special, but King's Gold does everything right for a game like this. It's quick, easy to carry around, it's light and it's quite fun. 

It's not particularly good for 2 players, but it's great as a filler for some loud fun with a bunch of friends.

Este jogo é simplesmente sensacional para jogar com crianças. Dê para seus filhos, sobrinhos ou até mesmo de presente e veja a partida rolar entre eles. Não existe uma estratégia real aqui, mas a maneira como ele flui funciona direitinho para sua proposta!

Quick and armless push your luck game. I don't know why I like this one better than King of Tokyo. I like both themes, but perhaps this one is shorter?

Sweet dice game with some huge swings possibilities so that the game is never lost as long as the last piece is in the box. Lots of interaction, quite fun for the genre.

Good kid's game & light fun as a quick filler on game night.  Scales well for all player counts.  More interactive than Zombie dice because you can steal from other players.  At the same time, it's not quite as exciting as Zombie Dice b/c there isn't as much 'push your luck'.  Excellent components, compact & nice price . . .  so a good buy for any collection.

There is not a lot of choice here, you roll the dice, and if they don't totally suck you most of them.

In my opinion Martian Dice and A Fistful of Penguins is a much better push your luck dice thrower. Too bad, I was really hoping I'd like this one.

I think this game is very good for what it is: a quick filler/pool bag game.  I got this for my kids to play at the pool during the 15 min. break time.   I laminated the player aid and now everything is water proof!  We all really enjoy the player interaction and the challenge of stealing from the king or pushing your luck to take all the loot from the ship.  This game is not anything amazing, but it is fun, quick and with just a little bit of strategy.  Mostly knowing when to steal from another player or when to take from the ship and pay the king.  We usually play best 2 out of 3.  In conclusion: light ( approachable), quick, interactive, fun with durable components.

Great Game! And after at least a dozen games, someone FINALLY rolled all Cannons. Huzzah!
The 'tin box' is also a very nice touch, as is the full color, small rulebook with clear explanations in seven languages.

Fun and simple game, and has a great turn around factor. Favorite Moment: My second turn I get 5 cannons, which give me all the gold in the tin, and ends the game. Dana: You're walking home!

RATING: 7
Enjoyable little filler. The Plastic coins are nice, and the game is simple enough to be explained in a minute. Nothing new, but sometimes, people wants to play this kind of game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Great component and box.

The game has two major (opposing) problem:
- A player could roll all cannons on his first turn and instantaneously win the game without any other play having played.
- Stealing from player is not too hard to do; it happens at most turn. It means the money just turns around with the turn order. It makes the game unnecessarily drag plus constantly counting who has the most money when there's 60 coins in play is a pain.

You'd be better off with one of the millions other dice game available.

RATING: 8
Rated after 1 play so this can change....but I loved the game. It's a very simple dice game where you roll dice and keep on steeling coins from your apponant or a ship. Easy to teach, easy to play and it plays fast.

misssing a dice from the box. Tried to contact blue orange and no response at all for months. I can't play this game at all !! 

edited: blue orange finally respond claiming a bug in their system and offer me a game of their range. but i reject their offer and just want the replacement dice.

There are some die results which are wildly broken and OP (taking all of the King's gold, or taking all of the bag gold). I saw player 2 win on their first turn, with player 3 not even getting a turn.

The games are short enough that it's not a huge deal-breaker...but it's clearly a balance issue.

Short dice game. Stealing is included in this pirate themed game.

The [url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077008/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1]Hervé Villechaize[/url] of gaming. Gets +2 bonus points because it's so short. The shrill French accent doesn't hurt either: swooning damsels, flashed garters, etc.

Plus it's fun to roll all cannons/coins and win for no good reason.

Alas, not a purchase.  And I don't really need to ever play again.

ESSEN 2014

FR - Vu sur TricTrac et acheté à Essen Spiel 2014. Le parfait petit jeu de voyage par le format et le fun, forcément basé sur l'interaction entre joueurs. Expliqué en 2 minutes, il se joue vite (10 min), convient très bien pour 'tuer le temps' ou attendre la partie suivante d'un gros jeu. les combinaisons de dés déterminent les actions, la stratégie consiste à savoir quand s'arrêter... Et il y a assez de pièces à gagner pour qu'un 'jack pot' sur le trésor du Roi ne suffise pas à gagner la partie.

This is more like the Master of Orion: The Card Game, so there's no 4X here. But what you do have is a great card game with multi-use cards. Particularly interesting is how special abilities are limited to 4 max, as anymore must be stacked on another.

If they came out with an expansion that allowed something of simple trading, it would replace Race for the Galaxy for me.

Bought this at GenCon 50 before I did the demo. Probably would not have bought it if I did the demo first. It is an OK game by itself but if you know the MOO IP this has nothing to do with it other then the name slapped on. There is no 4X at all. 

I am puzzled why the advisors can attach to any race, and they have double sided race cards with some of the races on one side but all humans on the other. The humans are vanilla with no special abilities while the other races have them - humans in the PC game are diplomats so I would expect something along that vein. There are different ways to win but am hard pressed to link them with actual win conditions in the video game.

If you are looking for a quick, semi-ok beer and pretzel game it is OK for the price. If you buy it thinking you will have the 4X experience of MOO you will be sorely disappointed.

Relatively light engine/tableu builder.

It is a direct competitor (both theme- and mechanics-wise) to the Alien Artifacts, another faux 4X card game. This one is even less complex, but also less fiddly and generally works better.

It's bit of a shame that the Master of Orion theme ended up used for such a light game. The factions are nearly similar, there is very little player interaction and the overall experience is very forgettable, nothing new here at all.

The game works effortlessly, but is a bit bland after awhile once you realise there isn't much variance in the card effects and the actions you end up taking each round to feed your victory engine. About 3/4 through it overstayed it's welcome. Mind you, it works smoothly, yet I can't see wanting to revisit it that often.

Another small quibble is having to use sliding cubes to track resources. It is just very susceptible to being knocked about.

I think the game misses the mark and turns a nice concept into a point hoarding game instead of multiple objective game (diplomatic, conquest and scientific victory).

Also, the mechanics are not really good for the theme. Just by watching Dice Tower's video, I came up with an alternative for the resources + unrest. I am confident that I can come up with better mechanics than those used in the game.

Really, really watch a playthrough and evaluate if you want to buy it, or try it at a store or game-bar or at a friend's before buying. There is nothing new in this game, all the mechanics exists already and the goal of the game is to get points, which is a really lazy way to determine a winner and has been the dumdum trend of the past 10 years. Fed up with that crappy goal. I am certain people can come up with more creative ways to determine winners.

The playtest of this game was not thorough.

Leave the victory points to the trivia games man!

Master of Orion: The Card Game would be a more appropriate title. Race for the Galaxy or Eminent Domain are better comparisons than Eclipse etc. 

Each turn, players have between 3-5 workers and choose a card-related action: construct, get resources, trade resources, get more cards, increase loyalty or use an advisor. The construct action is the central action. Players can build up to four stacks (planetary systems) of max. 5 cards. The top card gives some special ability or an immediate bonus. The focus can be on military to defeat other players, improve construction abilities or resource generation.

Building a good engine out of the cards is fun. There are enough different cards to keep the game interesting although not on par with the multitude of options present in RFTG. The attacks in MOO are a drawback though. They aren't crippling as they only decrease loyalty but will be annoying for selected players as they are targeted and they need to divert actions to raising their loyalty again that other players can use to further improve their engine. Willing to play again but no need to own.

After a video review: I am really not sure about this game. I do like the idea od the tableau building game and the component, but there are a few weird mechanics. Building cards into system is ok, but only the mast card in the system is active. The advantage is that you only have to look out for 4 cards, but the order of play for those cards matter a lot.

It also feels like a worker placement game, a bit weird that your resources and actions greatly varies through the game. I guess I'll have to play first, Maybe I was expecting more with the same components.

First, I'm a huge fan of tableau builders / engine building games so the gameplay interested me immediately.  I did not go into this expecting it to have any more than a passing similarity to a MOO game.  

This has a lot of similarity to Imperial Settlers / 51st State.  You're building cards that give you different special actions / benefits.  I would say this is quite a bit lighter than those 2 games.  This game does not require as much resource conversion/management.  The various combos appear to be simpler.  Not a large variety of cards.  I think this will impact the longevity of this game, unless expansions are released.  

There appears to be a couple of different strategies to pursue.  There's some light interactions between players since you can attack each other.  However, the majority of the time, the attacks aren't going to derail your plans so I imagine most people should be able to handle the confrontation in the game.  

Is this MOO distilled down to a 45 minutes game?  No, but if you're looking, for a light tableau / engine building game, this is worth a look.

Am I going to be playing this non-stop?  No because there would be a good chance of burning out on the game since it is so simple.  However, I could see this being good for occasional play since the rules and strategy are straightforward.

Interesting "War-like" tableau builder.
It's obviously not a full-on war game, but it does have the tension of being in danger at all times as you have to be aware of the military levels of the other players.

Fairly interesting  building abilities but could use even more cards.
Would insta-buy an expansion that added the same number of cards and races/advisors.

More variety/replay-value please!

Aside from some nostalgia from recognizing the alien races, there is little connection between this card game and its namesake video game. The gameplay is fine: combo seeking, resource management, restrained combat. It has a bit of a Race for the Galaxy-light feel. Not bad.

Played this one at Origins this year and had no prior experience with the PC game. This is an excellent tableau-builder! Artwork, iconography, and mechanics are very well done. Game is easy to pick up and play and teach. Multiple paths to victory. Far more intuitive for new players to pick up the rules/icons than RftG. 

Since it was a 4-player demo we were only allowed to compete against each other with the Human stats & without the adviser cards; so I'm curious as to how the various aliens will play out against each other. 

Would have liked to see it play 5, but maybe they will have an expansion. Also want to play it with 2 to see how that plays out. 

Pre-ordered; haven't heard a solid release date yet.

Did not enjoy. Left a bad taste in my mouth and a desire to play the old computer game (Moo2) which was much more enjoyable. Missing the progression of technologies and is just a random draw from the most basic to the most advanced. If you get bad cards dealt you have to waste time shuffling your hand to get playable cards. Really should have had 3 decks of structures from basic to advanced so you can draw higher as you progress.

Really did not enjoy this game. Cards and powers are quite a bit unbalanced some being clearly better than others not justified by the cost. The game relies quite a bit on random card draw, and because the cards can combo with each other, having a bad draw really slows you down. However, the combo are rather blant and boring, so you don't get much satisfaction except for some VPs. 
Overall I'd much rather play RftG.

A bit disappointed with the quality and quantity of the game content.
The player boards are very flimsy and the races limited. Why not make the Player boards the same quality as the main board. 
The cubes are very unimaginative, basic wooden blocks in stark red, blue, yellow and green and dont match the theme of the rest of the game content. 

The turn marker is a tiny circular cardboard disk that is hard to see against the board.
All in all quite underwhelming.
The art work is very nice however.

RATING: N/A
Based on the preview done by W. Eric Martin in a Game Preview post to Spiel 2016 this game dropped from 'Must Have' status to 'Don't buy this'.

Why? First off, I absolutely LOVE the Master of Orion videogames (I & II). So when finally someone took it on themselves to bring that universe to boardgaming, I absolutely jumped in excitement.

Now I watched the game. Besides experiencing the 'hype-disappointment', I found this might be a decent game... if Race for the Galaxy had not existed. If Eclipse had not existed. If Glory to Rome had not existed. Heck, if Twilight Imperium had not existed! As it stands, I'd play any of these games over this mediocre stuff any time. So why the comparisons to exact these games?

RfTG: Master of Orion the Boardgame is an adaptation into a card-game, which you put down in system, giving you more stuff/actions to do in your turn. Quite familiar to RfTG, besides the excellent 'lifting off other players actions' is not present. There goes interaction compared to RfTG.
Eclipse: MoO has resource management baked in, much like Eclipse. But no discoveries, no ship-design, no exploration of planets and no wargaming. Granted, that takes away a lot of duration as well but these aspects are the most fun of Eclipse, NOT the bookkeeping.
Glory to Rome: MoO has multiple use cards, just as in Glory to Rome. However, where Glory To Rome focuses on this fun, multi-use aspect, MoO mixes it up with some generic actions you can choose from, drawing attention away from the most fun aspect: agonizing over your cards, deciding which one to use and which one to trash.
Finally Twilight Imperium: to do justice to the MoO universe I'd expect a TI3 like game. A grand, epic wargame taking a full day fully immersing you in the excellent universe. Granted, that is not the way gaming these days is going because who has a full day to spend (together with 4 or 5 friends as well, preferably)? But I think that would be the ONLY type game that does that epic videogame justice. 

Finally, the sum of the whole is not bigger as it's parts. The feel I got was not that I was building a space empire to contest with other players, but rather one like in RfTG: a well oiled engine that happens to be set in space. But RfTG has the same playing time but is simply a superior game as it has much more interaction by it's excellent 'lift off other players action' mechanic. So why would I play this one then?

As it stands, it has the license, but it fails on the gameplay. There are much, much better games out there, depending on what you look for. Dropped to 'don't buy'.

very simplified card game in comparison to its namesake computer game
smooth gameplay though, could be fun ?
Maybe the odd reminiscence to the Master of Orion computer games doesn't have to hurt. Maybe it can be a sort of fun little souvenir for Master of Orion fans. One just has to overlook that the game doesn't have to do much with its namesake.
Thin cardboard and thin cards suck!

in short:
++ plays well and some nice ideas (advisers, ...)
+ artworks/graphics design solid
-- too simplified(!)
- thin cardboard, thin cards
- not really Master of Orion fitting/worthy
- expensive for what it is, card game sold as board game
- only 6(7) races, Humans have no special power (Fail!)


"Master of Orion: The Card Game"
It's a good card game. But it's not a good Master of Orion game or space 4X strategy game.
I guess if you want the real space 4X board game experience you have to look for something like "Twilight Imperium" or "Eclipse". (I personally even think that space 4X is better as a computer game.)

Basically this is a ripoff of 51st state/Imperial Settlers (or kind of Terraforming Mars), and while I like the basic rules more, the cards are just superboring, and the way agression works in this game is on one hand better, because the attack action doesn't really hurt others, but the red cards are really mean. Terraforming Mars is still the best in the build cards and get income genre, sadly, because I really love the theme and some of the mechanisms of this. By the way it is nothing like the PC game.

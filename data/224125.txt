Quite a boring little game. On paper, it seems fun: different routes to victory, card drafting for more strategic/interactive choices, blocking of techs, and a stock system. Unfortunately, the reality is a disappointment.

The drafting phase seems like a waste of time, since you only draw three cards, and more often than not, your choices really don't matter. This could have been improved by a six card hand, with three drafts of "draft one, discard one, pass."  But beyond that, game play is still a slow, unexciting tug-of-war. It often doesn't matter in which order you play your cards, and the personal goals are near-impossible to achieve. So both players just go through the motions until the game is over. Yawn.

I like it a lot.  It seems like they have done a great job at boiling down the mechanics to a challenging yet fun game.  We tried our first game without trading assistants.  I'm excited to see how that tweaks the game play.  In our first game it felt a little anti climactic at the end but I believe it is due to being unclear on a couple things due to it being the first time through.

It’s fine. Haven’t played the core game so can’t compare, but this just felt lacking.

Wasn't sure I'd find another game as good as 7 Wonders Duel, but I've found it. And it's not just "another 7 Wonders Duel", it's a different game entirely. In fact, even quicker than 7 Wonders Duel, with the same level of meaningful decisions. Brilliant!

I've never played the original game nor do I feel that I need to.  As a 2 player game, it is obviously crafted in the likes of 7 Wonders: Duel as a unique 2 player experience of a very different game.  It features a nice tension between achieving your goals for victory while watching those of your opponent.  Add to this a cool historical look, and all in all it makes for a quick but surprisingly good game.

Almost a bit too quick for the setup.  Almost always play twice once it's setup.  Nice and strategic though.

Being a 2-player stock oriented game, I felt that Duel lack any real tension.  There is very little competition as both players independently collect sets of stock and maybe vie for one technology, which simply passes back and forth every turn. Not a bad game, but overall mediocre.

We played at GenCon and liked the gameplay. However, we both really detest Edison. We didn't buy the game because neither of us would want to play as Edison. No one mentioned the other 6 characters that could be used in the game. We may buy this now that we know there are more choices.

The full TvE game is my favorite Euro, and this streamlined 2 player version doesn't disappoint either! It plays super fast, has some really interesting choices that seem to have a big effect on the game, and it's got that awesome TvE theme dripping from every corner. Love it!

Tesla vs. Edison: Duel offers some interesting decisions, but it fell a bit flat for me. The decision space is quite narrrow, which results in gameplay feels a bit limiting and scripted. The theme doesn't come across very strongly either. This one didn't do a lot for me, but it's short enough that I'd play again.

Much like the more in-depth, multiplayer "War Of Currents" game, "TvE Dual" is fidgety. For every action, there is a rule, often followed by one or more conditions or follow-up micro actions. To really enjoy this game, it requires two things: a memorized understanding of the rules; and the quick counting and recounting (of points on cards). If either player is intent on winning (by analyzing point counts) the final action of the game can take longer than the entirety of all the prior eight turns. The entire game seems to be won/lost on the last turn.

"Overall, I think Tesla vs. Edison: Duel is a great little game! It's been a while since I've thought about 7 Wonders: Duel (long enough that I'd probably be within my rights to update my rating a bit), but I think this is the more accessible of the two, as it's a bit easier to learn and not nearly as mean, both of which are great avenues by which I can get it to the table. I'm not sold on the PR part of the game, but that's a pretty minor complaint, all things considered. It's got great art, a neat theme, I love the graphic design elements of the game, and it's got a surprising amount of diversity (though I'd've loved to see more among the Assistants) given the time period. It's a neat game and I'd recommend checking it out if you're looking for another cool duel game!"

Amikor futott a Kickstarter kampánya, beszálltam én is. Mire megjött, már nem értettem, hogy miért is kellett ez nekem. De ha már itt van, játsszunk vele!
És kár is lett volna kihagyni, mert nagyon jó kis játék ez. A szabályok egyszerűek, a játékidő rövid, mert fix 3 fordulóból áll, de korábban is vége lehet a játszmának, ha valaki egyéni győzelmi feltétele teljesül. Olyan Schotten Totten stílus, annál gémerebb lehetőségekkel. Aki szereti a kétfős könnyed, de kombinálgatós adok-kapok kártyajátékokat, mindenféleképpen érdemes próbát tennie a TvsE Duellel.

A fast, pretty straight forward, yet not shallow area control game. With only three areas to control, gets pretty tight ;)

Reminds me of Battleline, but I'd rather play Battleline.  Lacks tension as there is a lot of simple back and forth play.

So much to enjoy in this little game. Lots of 7 Wonders style point scoring and friendly-ish 'take that' mechanics mixed in with The War of Currents theme. Easy to play both sides solo with a blind AI draw too. And, it plays quickly.

Usually not into the 1v1 tug of war games. This one has card drafting and different actions to take. It was way more interesting than others in the genre. I have been having a great time with this game and it plays super quickly. Would definitely recommend.

A bit heavy to apprehend in the first game, but then after that the game flows well and is enjoyable to play.
The weak point imo is the design of personal goals. They can be used as an optional way to finish the game earlier. They are quite difficult to achieve, and that would not be a bad point if it weren't that for many inventors they are even useless as an aware opponent can always prevent it at almost no cost.

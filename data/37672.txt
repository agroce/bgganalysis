Rating is NOT based on this set of rules. I bought this only because I wanted the miniatures and the box was offered for a nice price.

If you really want to have some fun playing 40K, get the 2nd edition rules & the Dark Millennium expansion (please read my comments on 2nd edition of W40K and Dark Millennium).

An amazing amount of stuff for the price, Black Reach is an excellent introduction to an insidious hobby. Be prepared to pay an insane amount of money for larger armies, but if you want to dip your toes into Warhammer 40k, then this is the best way to do it.

The rules are too simple for the most part and do not promote interesting tactical decisions.  Can still be fun, but no longer worth investing in for me (after having played for many years starting in 1998).

RATING: 6
  My first impression is underwhelming. The box is full of gaming goodness (i.e. minis) but I can't recommend the product for beginners to Warhammer 40,000. The problem I have is that this is supposed to be an intro game but it does nothing to teach you how to play. The Assault on Black Reach Book is basically a GW/Warhammer 40,000 catalog and only has two pages dedicated to play. I wish they would have added progressive missions/scenarios that introduce more complex rules similar to Battle for Macragge. Overall the book seems to be an after thought to the entire package. 
  

  The mini 40k 5th edition rules are nice to look at but appear to be flimsy and paper thin. I damaged my rulebook quite easily by being incautious and catching the front cover against the outer lip of the box causing a nasty crease. You have to remember that the boxes that GW products come in are not sturdy, so how anyone can damage anything with the box is beyond me.

RATING: 6
Kids like to play around with the models more than they actually like to play the game.

Not that bad, but doesn't feel balanced at all. Not the idea here perhaps as you're supposed to use this as a base and then build upon it.

RATING: 8.5
This is a great starter set for Warhammer 40k 5th Edition.  It comes with enough figures to have fairly complex armies.  It only comes with Space Marines and Orks.  However, you also get a rule book that covers ALL the rules for this game (yes it is exactly the same as the 5th edition hardcover rule book) and you get a set of templates.  Definitely worth getting if you simply want to see what it's like and aren't put off by having to build your miniatures.

“We'd better get back, 'cause it'll be dark soon, and they mostly come at night... mostly.” - Newt

It is important to note that unlike most games featured on boardgaming.com this box gets you into the game but there is a bigger world with many dollars to be spent.

GAMEPLAY
40K is a war-game based on the turn sequence of move, shoot, and assault. Each player takes their turn with a small amount of response or interjection from the other player. The rules are fairly complex with each phase containing rules to cover almost every eventuality. The basic elements of the game can be grasped through the scenario book included in the box. Each scenario adds rules and models to build comprehension.
COMPONENTS
In the box, there are Space Marines and Orcs. Space marines are the prototypical good guys super-humans fighting for humanity to the end. Orks are the colorful chaotic aliens fighting for fightin’s sake. The plastic is well molded and durable. Most of these models are only one or two pieces, easy to put together. Games Workshop makes some of the best sculpted models in the world; these are not their best but considering the quantity there is a ton of great modeling in the box.
THEME
The future is a dark place. Way way in the future. Warhammer 40K is an expansive setting and the rulebook begins as all of their books do, “In the darkness of the far future there is only war.” 40K is the best science fiction setting out there. Its gothic, gritty, and huge. There are adult elements to the world including demons and half naked ladies. These can be avoided for the younger crowd and do not have much if any presence in this box.
WHO IS IT FOR?
I have had a lot of experience with young kids trying to assemble models and remember rules and its very difficult for anyone under 12 to really grasp and enjoy. Small games last an hour. This box is for gamers who are interested in modeling and are able to spend much more of their disposable income on painting supplies and more models.

There is a lot to say about 40K beyond this box. I want to discuss two issues beyond the normal scope of a review. First, cost. I have watched the yearly price increases through the years and every time it makes me wince with pain. Unfortunately the company gets to make the prices and we as hobbyists have to decide whether our dollars are worth trading for their plastic. There are an ever increasing number of good miniature games and companies out there. If Games Workshop has, in your opinion, over stepped their bounds by out-pricing themselves try some of the other cool miniature games. Second, rules. 40K is a complex set of rules which tries to cover every eventuality. With the main rulebook plus over a dozen army books there is a ton of variation in the types of models. It is difficult to cover every rule conflict eventuality, could they do better? Sure. Does it kill the game? No. No other game system has the army variety of 40K and been able to keep as many armies competitive and relevant in the tournament community. And thats only if you require your army to be a tournament success.
Finally, If you do decide to jump into the world of 40k or any war-game there is a ton of satisfaction in the modeling, painting, and playing.

RATING: 7
An [i]incredible[/i] value for beginner and veteran alike—a bucket-load of better-than-average minis for Ork/Space Marine players, scatter die and blast templates, and all the rules in a super-handy handbook (small form-factor paperback).

It's kind of funny to claim I own this, as I've already cannibalized and parted out the entire box contents:

- Orks, dice, templates and rulebook to my sons

- Terminators into my previously-raided Space Hulk game

- Space Marine minis into my bitz box.

I'm using the box proper to hold all the random 40k crap—rule book, dice, templates, rulers & tokens.

UPDATE:  Marking as "previously owned" for the sake of honesty.

A great starter set for Warhammer 40k. Includes everything you need to get an idea on how to play the game, and a good chunk of minis. I bought this with someone else: he got the Space Marines and I kept everything else.

Great value in this set.  The three Deffkoptas, SM Dreadnought, templates and rulebook are worth the price alone.  Everything else is free.

You get enough stuff to get started.  It may be a bit difficult to play through everything, as there is no basic game or programmed instruction like in Battle for MaCragge.  The rules aren't difficult for an experienced wargamer, but there are enough of them that you need to follow the advice in the Getting Started book and just work through a basic Orkboyz vs Tactical Squad skirmish before adding in the Dreadnought and Deffkoptas.

Beware, though!  This is like your first hit of plastic crack.  WH40k is a fun, addicting hobby to get into.  You'll find yourself buying minis, paints, codices, styrofoam to make terrain, etc...

Where are the missions ?
Not the one for tournament in the "little big" rule box, but the one dedicated to that one (just like Battle for Maccrage) ?

Sorry it is just a compilation of SM and Orks detachment boxes and the V5 rulebook for the Poor which doesn't bring anything better than V4.

They should have sold it 10$ less without rulebook or 1/3 price with just Marine or just Orks.

This is the starter set for the 5th edition of Warhammer 40,000 (40k).

It's the best starter Games Workshop has ever released according to many. Much better than the 4th ed set at least (Battle for Macragge) in terms of Units received.

Anyway, this set is amazing for a prospective 40k player interested in Orks or Space Marines. It's a great value for older player as well who use those armies.

You actually get around 500 points of Orks and closer to 600 of Marines. 

The only way this set would be better would be if it actually had some scenarios, and gave you all the extra special rules for both sides (such as the Orks Waaagh! ability and the Marines And They Shall Know No Fear [ATSKNF]) - but it's still great.

You also get two measuring sticks, 6d6, a scatter die, and a set of plastic templates in a lovely neon green.

I resisted as long as I could, but I finally succumbed to the total geektastic hobby game that is Warhammer 40K.  It also doesn't hurt that I was given a fairly large unpainted Tau army for free by my friend's brother who "would never get around to playing."  I am enjoying the construction and painting aspect immensely, and the game is pretty darned awesome.

Starter box for 40k, bought two boxes together with Jo ([url=https://boardgamegeek.com/user/Gaston2010]Gaston2010[/url]). I got the Orks, he got the Space Marines. I painted all my Orks and dabbled in the game a bit, but the rules didn't grab me nearly as much as the fluff did.

Very good value for your money, a complete game in a box. You get a decent ammount of very high quality figures, the rules, templates etc. Purchasing a few more units would give you enough figures for intersting games.

Of course Black Reach is a gateway drug. Sell the 1st batch cheap and reap the profits after ou get the poor soul hooked, so beware!

A good introduction to 5th edition, and the starting forces are actually fairly impressive.

Filed under Previously Owned since I traded away the Orks.

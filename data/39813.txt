Wow this is even better than the orginal and that's saying something.  This will get lots of play and the wife loves it.  That's a big plus.

I have never owned a game that so many people wanted to buy their own copy.  If only they could get it for sale at Target and Walmart with a bit of buzz it would sell tons of copies.

No reason to have this version if you have the original. It is the same game - with alot more luck boiled into it. I was hoping for a different type of game. It is a bit more portable than the original - so that is something. Anyhow, basically Qwirkle where you can roll for the shape you want. Not sure that's an improvement at all.

Oddly enough, more of a gamer's game than the original, but less fun...for me, at least.  I was very AP-prone, and the colors were still a little too close for my tastes.  That having been said, there's another dimension to the game that should be appealing to many.  (And the box is smaller than [b]GiftTrap[/b].)  Unfortunately, I probably won't ask to play it again.

Nice compact version of Qwirkle that worked very well with the non-gamers I introduced it to.
Interestingly, though this is the same game as Qwirkle, it had a different "feel" tactically.  Because players can re-roll the cubes at the beginning of each turn, there is a more constant threat that other players may be able to roll the piece or series of pieces they need to complete a big score.  In Qwirkle, there seems to be a larger margin of safety to set yourself up for a score on the next pass.  in Qwirkle cubes, it feels like you have to play a bit more defensively since each player has far more potential options on their move (and the open-handedness makes that apparent).  
I really like this difference between the two versions - it feels like the two variants of Cartagena (though the two games have very little in common) where you can play open-handed or closed-handed resulting in a more (or less) tactical game.

Same placement and scoring rules as Qwirkle. You may re-roll cubes at the beginning of your turn to try to enhance your placement options. That added bit of strategy makes this game a smidgen better than Qwirkle. For good or for ill, scores tend to be higher and bonuses more frequent. Also, the feeling of repetition that sets in near the end of some games of Qwirkle is less likely to occur here. Beware of gamer types who will stew over which dice to re-roll, though.

RATING: 7
[2 plays] Very pleasantly surprised by this.  I expected some feeble attempt to make more money off the Qwirkle name with an unnecessary variant, but I really liked Qwirkle Cubes.  In fact, I'm now torn as to which I should get, this or regular Qwirkle.
The main differenc in Qwirkle Cubes is that everything is open.  No more Scrabble-style rack of secret tiles.  You can see everyone's holdings all the time, but their "tiles" are Qwirkle dice that can be rerolled on their turns.So we've gone from a world in which knowledge is secret but static, to a more dynamic one in which there's constant potential for change, but possibilities and probabilities are open to all. Instead of "this would be a good play unless X has a green square, but I don't know whether she does," with Cubes it's either "I can safely make this move because X doesn't have any green cubes" or "this is risky because X has x green cubes which she might reroll into squares."  I think it opens the space of possibility more for each player; instead of being stuck with a rack of bad tiles and having to either slowly find places to play them off or else use a turn to swap them, you have partial latitude to change them on the fly, during play.

RATING: 8
While I haven't played the original Qwirkle, this game appealed to me more, partly because of the increased possibilities from rolling the dice, and also because no information is hidden, which can help teach the game to others. This is a very good game, an interesting combination of yahtzee and scrabble, though much better than either of those. This is by far my favorite dice game. 

I got some 3/4" blank wooden cubes to use as "stops" (like the black squares in a crossword puzzle) to mark places where no cube can be played. It speeds up the game significantly.

Edit: I have since played Qwirkle, and much prefer this game.

Great family game about on the level of Ingenious.  Nice components, quick & easy rules, strategy, with a modest playing time.  I rate this a 8 because my family asks to play this one.  Also with 2 people final scores go over 200 and are often within 1-3 points.  This means until the very end can be anyone's game.  The "sometimes brain freeze" keeps this at a 9 instead of a 10.

With the cubes it's not necessary to remove 3 tiles (a variant to eliminate perfect knowledge).  The flip side is you know what color other players have or have not.
Marc suggests it would be better to have some die that are 'same shape, different color' along with the existing 'same color, different shape'.

Hmnja. I do like the probability calculation part, as I see the color my opponent has, but the game dragged on for much too long, especially since I got a 29 point move midway through the game and there was never any meaningful danger of him catching up. Probably popular due to its simplicity, but a little low on the excitement scale, too.

The dice version of "scrabble with colors and shapes". I like the dice version in that if you don't like the shapes you have, you can just re-roll them at the beginning of your turn (instead of taking your whole turn to get rid of them). However the re-rolling and being able to see everyone's stuff does slow down the game.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (July 2010)

Ok game. One of the first boardgames I ever played. It has lots of luck in it but as it plays (more or less) quickly I don’t mind much. I played it a lot on 2010, nowadays I don’t feel the urge to play it, so I think it has a low replay value. This game is perfect to play with family or to attract new members to our hobby. The dice are gorgeous and when they are placed in the play area, the game looks pretty nice.  

I think I would like Qwirkle tiles better but I have not played it yet. 

I would play this again but this is not a game I will request (although perhaps I will buy it to play with my family). For now I´m rating it a 4.5 due to my low desire to play the game.

Current Rating: 4.5

RATING: 5.5
A nice dice game.  Do wish the dice were better quality, they are not bad, just feel a bit oversized and they bounce/roll feels off.  Granted I suppose at the core this is a game best suited for young'uns, give them plenty of opportunity at color, shape and pattern recognition and with some dice rolling to keep them interested.

RATING: 7.4
Qwirkle Cubes is about 75% the same as Qwirkle which is quite a lot, considering how simple these games are. Of course the difference is the dice rolling. Dice distribution makes it possible to have lots of same-faced dice placed on the table (which makes the game less calculable, less strategic in the endgame) while the possibility of re-rolling isn't only fun but also gives you more possibilities and more to consider - especially as there is no hidden information here, so you can see all the others' dice (which they can reroll, of course, but the color is still a strong information, just like the currently available symbols). So I think I like it as much as I like Qwirkle.

... And won't sell it as it fits in the box of Qwirkle, next to the tiles. :)

the dice rolling, I think, doesn't really make it better nor worse.

So I think I like it as much as I like Qwirkle.

I think both the original and this cubes version bring something different to the table that will appeal much differently.  Cubes will generally play faster and one will often gamble on rolling a cube to try and finish out a set of 6.  There is more direct strategy and long range planning in the original while the Cubes version is much more tactical and in the moment.

Fun spin on Qwirkle... where the tiles are replaced by die, but I prefer the original.  Sure it's nice role and change a shape that is useless, but it's difficult to plan your move on other players turns when your entire hand may change.

Variation plus intéressante que la version classique. Plus stratégique car on voit les couleurs et formes des autres joueurs, plus de flexibilité (et de chance) car on peut remplacer les dés de notre choix. Les qwirkles sont facilement réalisables et version plus compacte.

Wonderful abstract strategy on dice! I actually like this version of Qwirkle better than the original. My wife will even play this one (she has difficulty wanting to play abstracts). She will play this one maybe because of the colors and makings sets...I'm just not sure. This is a wonderful family game, medium length, and the components are awesome.

Definitely prefer the original more, but this is not a bad game.  Slightly more portable than the original, and it does offer the opportunity to end up with a better "hand" by re-rolling.  Of course, it might end up worse, too.

Fun little game. Feels a bit like playing scrabble. Easy and quick game to play. One of the very good things about this game is that it's instantly playable bay any player. You can virtually explain the game with the first player's first turn. Occasional players are very likely to enjoy this game because of this.

- Very easy to explain and pick up.

This is a clever change from the original Qwirkle, but I don't like it as much.  Each player can see everyone else's cubes all the time, and players get to re-roll cubes, so there doesn't seem to be as much strategy.  Still, it's not a bad game.

'Qwirkle: The Dice Game'. Better than expected. Getting to see what colors others have (and what cubes they'll potentially have) is great for long-term planning and reduces reliance on counting, plus it takes the guesswork out of blocking, always a plus. Some interesting risk-optimizing decisions.

On the downside, game flow is uneven and downtime can be atrocious when playing with AP-plagued optimizers. Optimize at start of turn (helped by doing during others' turns), gauge risk, re-roll, [I]then[/I] optimize the new set (unavoidable). The latter enables open hands and interesting take-that decisions involving risk, at the cost of increased downtime.

Might not be best with 2 since luck plays a bigger role in not being able to block plans. With more, just have to keep screwing your left and ganging up to block the leader when his right-neighbor mentions he can't do it.

I am a very big fan of Qwirkle, so was intrigued by this (seemingly obligatory) entry into the dice game genre.  The basic rules remain the same, only now, you get to roll dice to determine what you can put down.  For all practical purposes you lose a lot of the limiting factor that rein in the original game.  Also, since you can re-roll your dice every turn, you add additional time every turn to evaluation of your play -- not a good thing for Qwirkle and less of a good thing for a dice game.  [12/29/2009]

Qwirkle Cubes -- Played once; three-player.

This felt a bit more difficult than the original -- certainly it took more time to play. The ability to re-roll cubes added some tension, as we all had many moments when we set aside some safely playable cubes and re-rolled the others in the hopes of getting specific shapes. It's a blast when the hoped-for shape does turn up.

One of the main reasons this is my favorite board game is because of the abstract format. I can relate this game to the Tundra Orcs from one of my favorite games, Summoner Wars. I can relate them because both of them are kind of like a gamble. In summoner wars, you rely on the dice to get you to win with those orcs, and in qwirkle cubes, you must have the dice "respect" your commands.

tl;dr: the same, but a bit more random

This is very much Qwirkle, but the fact that you don't draw fixed tiles but roll cubes, does change the game in a significant way: there is no limit of 3 identical symbol/color combinations.
There is also less planning since you roll random cubes, and you get to re-roll them.
I enjoyed this, but I do think the original is slightly superior.

RATING: 6.5
Much nicer quality than the original and smaller means less space with nearly the same feel. Also, no having to "track" shapes left - pretty much if you leave a row of 5, its will be open to anyone with the right color as they can roll for the qwirkle. This makes it a bit more random, but I don't think it is enough to make this game annoying.

The original is better. The dice add a nice mechanic, but they create downtime (the players always want to roll their dice before their turn, but they have to wait because things may change by the time it is their turn again). Also it adds a random element, which I do not particularly like.

A variation on Qwirkle where you have 6 cubes, each with one of the six figures on each side, but all the same color. Unlike the original version, you can roll as many of the dice as you wish before your turn. There are both advantages and disadvantages, and a lot of folks like the original better, because you know there are exactly 3 of every piece so you can calculate what's left to play.

When playing with other gamers, I prefer Qwirkle Cubes over Qwirkle. The extra layer of decision making appeals to me and yet I don't think it adds more time to the game. I also feel like I am able to do more long term planning and blocking. With new gamers and kids I still think I will play Qwirkle as it's easier to teach and less intimidating for them.

* My wife designed this game. I helped on its development and I playtested it a lot. I'm very proud of both her and the game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Very simple, but I don't think it's really worth pulling out with serious gamers.  As a two-player game, it has a modicum of planning, but with more, it becomes a simple case of hoping to get good draws and rolls, and then playing the most points.  This is sort of like Scrabble, without the need to make words, and without the bonuses on the board that give that game just a little more oomph.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
For now, I'm rating this game the same as its pappy, if only because the basic gameplay is the same.  There seems to be a tactical advantage to this game, since you can re-roll your dice to get the shape you need to complete a Qwirkle, but at the same time, it means that you wind up with this big block of Qwirkles on the table, and if you're not careful, you can wind up with a development that you can't build off of.  The game requires semi-cooperative play among players to make sure that this doesn't develop in the games.

Additionally, I don't like the "keep re-rolling until you get something you can play" rule.  There seems to be little incentive to not roll, especially as you near the end of the game and you're hoping for that one shape to complete the last Qwirkle on the board.

I'll need to play this one a few more times to see how it holds up against the original.

Game rules are easy to teach and learn. Player interaction is indirect and reasonably high. The game can be quite luck-driven as your re-rolls can result in what you want or not. Game components are reasonably good.

RATING: 6
I don't think I agree with the sentiment that the dice design makes Qwirkle more strategic.  With open information and the fact that your hand can change every turn, it just means that no line is safe any more, regardless how many cubes are in the sequence already.  I feel this took away the nice balance of maximizing your score while not setting your opponents up in the original, and replaced it with too much concern over what the others can and cannot do, even at the cost of getting less points.  I didn't care for the added randomness and AP, both of which served to over complicate an already very approachable game.

If you want a much longer version of [b]Pickomino[/b]...where the only variation on the original is to make it longer...where the box is huge, awkward, and reinforces a warped board...then this is something worth checking out.  Blech.

Good alternative if you are a Pickomino-fan! Somewhat different excitement curve.
Still you have to be able to count, judge probabilities and have a good portion of luck!

For me there is enough of a difference between this and Pickomino to justify owning.  Yah, it is similar but I liked the board play.  I don't think it's as good as Pickomino but that doesn't mean it's not good as Pickomino is a 10.  

Nice change of pace.

Definitely an improvement over it's older brother as you have the potential of banking some of your collected worms. 1 Play.

A Knizia dice game. Not bad... there's some nice push-your-luck with the rolling of the dice. But, as far as dice fillers go, I'd rather be playing King of Tokyo, or Liar's Dice, or To Court the King. And all of those games are equally approachable.

Players are rolling dice, trying to hit 23 plus, in order to place platters onto the bar-be-que and claim worms and snails.  Slightly more meaty version of Heckmeck.  The die rolling/reservation system is exactly the same, but made a little tougher as 23 is the base score to reach now.  Hitting a total allows you to take cute worms from the supply, and place a platter on the slot - if you can hit it again, you can lock that slot down making it safe, otherwise your worms can be stolen.  Crapping out places a snail (also cute) onto the bar-be-que, which becomes the game clock.  Nice game - similar to Heckmeck... but different!.  Not sure I'm a fan of the "huge" cube box.

RATING: 5
A little fun variant of the original "Heckmeck/Picomino" dice game with some additional "flavor". An additionl board to claim your share of the barbecue, your portion to secure the win. And adding the "snails" as another option to get additional points which are save till the end of the game.
But especially the uncertainness of your value/share nearly till the end of the game makes the original game so exciting and funny. Even with a "big" lead you could loose everything because the others playing together against you till they're trying to heading away with the worms... 
If you having the original, you don't need barbecue too. 
If you have non of both, I still would recomment the original.
But maybe you're playing with children the additional board and the less agressive playing style here could attract this variant for your family.

I will rate this one down one rank because of the material, the included dice in "dark brown" with coloured print in gold! 
It's not easy to see the dice result if you're playing in the evening or a slight darker environment. Could not understand why they used different dices in that game instead of the original white/red? Maybe they know...

Sushizock im Gockelwok > Pickomino > Heckmeck Barbecue

Only a few minor changes from Pickomino, but lasts longer and overstays it's welcome. I'll try this with the kids and see what they think.

A slight variation on Pickomino with a bit more decisions as you have the additional option of saving a worm piece for the rest of the game. If you have one, you don't need the other unless you're a really big fan.

Essentially the same game as Pickomino, but has the unfortunate downside of being longer. This is definitely a problem, and I would be hesitant to play this unless I knew it was not going to drag. I really enjoy Pickomino, but only if it moves quickly.

I guess this serie has seen it's best a couple of years ago. Heckmeck Barbecue isn't bad one, but it isn't the best either. If you own 'Heckmeck am Bratwurmeck', then there isn't any reason to own Barbecue version + this one comes in a big cube-kind-of-box which is a way too big.

RATING: 7.3
Why are dice games rated so low? It's a great variant of Pickomino - this one adds enough meat (no pun intended - there are "real" worms and snails added to the game here) to the game that it becomes the most thinky one with altered dice (6s added), a different way of stealing, locking your worms and some fun manipulation of the snails. I think it works great, I'd even say it works better than Pickomino - with one important exception: Pickomino is fine to be played in pubs while this one isn't.

A good variation of Heckmeck with a better rythm and the possibility to protect a space on the board. Also, in this version the dice as a 6 and not a 5 has pickomino. This offre more opportunity to obtain 36 and more. If you don't have the previous Pickomino, this one is for you.

Strong board game version of Heckmeck (Pickomino). The downside is it caps at 5... the upside is that the addition of the board makes the game more interactive with more opportunities to steal. Pickomino is one of the very best dice games and this is a worthy conversion to board game form.

An alternate universe version of Pickomino (Heckmeck am bratwurmeck), Heckmeck Barbecue features several material rule changes, notably, ways to lock down barbecued worms and a prohibition on claiming dominoes (spaces) on the table (board) valued  less than the roll. There are also little pink piles of poo. With the locking down ability, this Heckmeck ratchets down the topsy-turviness of the game, which was one of my favorite parts, so I'm personally sorting out what it means. Although both games are probably equally rulesy, this one feels rulesier. So it's a gut feeling, maybe an initialism bias, this preference of Pickomino to Heckmeck Barbecue.

Yet another incarnation of Heckmeck. This time in an oversized box and with a bit more protection from stealing. Not really an improvement over the original.

A lavish (wildly overproduced?) and "improved" version of Pickomino. This kind of dice game does not suit me at all. Boring game: two of four players started playing to make the game end, irrespective of the outcome.

As I love the original Heckmeck / Pickomino (the round tin can version which you can fit in the palm of your hand), I thought it would be fun to try out its "big brother". I assumed that a full sized box version of an essentially miniature game would make up with the added features by what it loses in portability. Unfortunately - I was wrong.

The first half of the game flowed just as smoothly as the original Heckmeck, but then suddenly the added features started to bog down the game to a point, where what is essentially a 15 minute filler game, took us over an hour a finish. The biggest problem - the ability to go bust when you roll a number which is already secured by another player. Unlike in the original game, when you then simply take the next biggest available number instead, now everyone starts to analyze, whether to proceed rolling, what kind of numbers you still haven't rolled, what is the likelihood of ending on one of the few still available places, what is the likelihood of rolling what you need vs what will end in failure. A fast and carefree filler game has suddenly turned into a computational analysis paralysis, so instead of going smoothly from start to finish like the original, this version will start dragging its feet midway through and become painfully slow by the end.

Also, while the scoring in the original game was simple and elegant, this one with its overproduced worms and snails is not. With the ability to lock down your plates, there is also less chance of catching up with a runaway leader. In the end, the leader finished the game by failing to score on purpose, just to trigger the end game condition. Needless to say, I will only be keeping the fast, carefree and super-portable original instead of this needlessly overproduced analysis-paralysis inducing inferior variation of the theme.

It's a proper push-your-luck game, in which rolling badly is — well — just bad.  Still, it's another different take on the Knizia / Zoch / chicken dice game concept, and fun at times.

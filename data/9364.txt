I played this game once a week for many weeks, many years ago.  I recall that it was quite fun. We used a deck from Germany with the Damen and Buba which gave it lots of flavor. You could use a regular pinochle deck though. 
The game was facinating in that one may not know who their partner is until sometime during play. The two players with the queens of clubs were partners. Anyway, lots of good memories with this one.

I've played a lot of difficult card games, but for someone with a North American background, this is one of the hardest. In short, unorthodox suit ranking, variable partnerships, a massive trump suit, special scoring opportunities, and in-game bidding all make for a lot to digest! The only thing that helped me with this one was being familiar with the A = 11 points, 10 = 10 points, K/Q/J = 4/3/2 points system which is common in other European card games.

The first time out, the whole thing had me looking at my reference sheet and shaking my head. The second time out, things started to click and the game itself was able to take centre stage more fully. The third time out, we were familiar enough with it to start adding some extra rules to spice things up. Of those I consider Schweinchen (if you have both Foxes you can declare it and they become the ubertrumps) and the "Caller of a Solo always leads" to be the only really critical adds, though I do see the charm in throwing a tonne of extra rules on top of the system for the sake of variety.

I advise anyone interested in this game to be sure that they actually have a group of people who are actively willing to give this game a fair day in court. The scoring and bidding are both opaque to virgins, and if you have people who easily get frustrated with learning new systems this will fall very flat, very quickly. For brand new players who are not regular card players I advise just ditching the standard side rules like the Foxes, Charlie Miller, and the Doppelkopf to start with, because people will already be choking on the numerical values of the cards, the A/10/K/9 ranking system, and the wild in-game bidding. Starting with standard Schafkopf is also an option, as the card play is similar, but much easier to follow. (Just make sure you play using the proper German rules if you opt to take this route, as they are the closest to Doko).

This game has gained measurably as I've become more familiar with it, and had a chance to play it repeatedly with the same group of people. It has both an interesting bidding and an interesting scoring system, and the changing partnership aspect of the game is unique in its implementation, at least in my experience. A creeper.

The only real weakness of this game is the difficulty in finding people who know how to play it, or who are willing to learn it...otherwise it's easily one of my favourite 4 player card games.

(Own two decks: a Fournier deck with French suits, and an Altenburger one with German suits and ranks)

My second-most played game of all time after Dominion, I have been playing this regularly for more than 20 years. I have literally played it several thousands of times - almost all of them offline.

I really liked it in the beginning, but it has become quite stale for me many years ago, I don't feel that it can offer me anything new and challenging after all those plays. I only keep playing it to get together with my old group which insists on still playing it.

I tried to abstract from my huge number of plays to stay "objective" and still rate it as a 5.5, but my currently felt personal rating would be considerably worse than that because I have played it to death so much.

Doppelkopf is probably the most played game of my youth.

It's a partnership trick-taking game for four players, and among the traditional card games stands out as one of the best. There is a certain learning curve involved, though, as the rules are quite complicated especially for people with no previous background in trick-taking games.

A little annoying about Doppelkopf is that there are so many house rules and variants that the first thing you need to do when playing with people you don't regularly play with is negotiate the rules used for this session. In addition, some of the variants (especially those that can make random pairs into top trumps) really degrade the game, too.

Jan10:

I've played 5 times now.  It's not bad really.  Partly that's because I've already played a bunch of Sheepshead.  So I know the ranks of the cards and the value of the cards.  If I didn't know that, then this would be a real pain in the ass to learn.

It's really all about the secret partners.  Other than that it's not too much of a game.  The randomness is actually a little high for me.

It's an odd beast in that half the cards are trump.  You are unlikely to run people out of trump since you really won't have a bunch of trump and all the high ones ever.  It's more about when the heck to dump the tens and aces that are worth so many points.

Anyway, it's good for a change of pace, but not my favorite trick taking game.  (Spades wins that distinction.)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Another excellent variation of Schafkopf with some nifty stuff added in. Its really not that hard to learn, as long as you learnt Schafkopf first and I think Skat is trickiest due to the bidding/scoring system in that one. 

I love the silent partner here just like in Schaf/Sheepshead, here it is tough sometimes though to decifer who your partner is for half of the round (unless Vorbehalt is called which I wish happened more often, its up to the deal and odds are always against these happening) which of course makes the initial play a little random.  There really is almost too much trump in this one versus regular Schaf too, and this makes them harder to count for one thing, harder (near impossible most hands) to flush out the Trumps and would also make calling "Poverty" or Armut a bit of a rarity I'm sure, which is too bad as its an interesting round hand. In these two ways, I think regular Schaf has a bit of an edge on this game but this game has some really cool additions that Schaf does not which elevates this game above that and just about ever other trad. card game out there less maybe Slovenian Tarock from which it was derived, its at the top with that, Skat, Schafkopf, Bridge and Tichu for sure.

With all the little regular game add-ons I REALLY like the scoring in this one and the betting is awesome too and its nice that the scoring is not extremish like some games where randomly dealt hands are hugely rewarded, here things tend to stay close which I like. Then there is the myriad of variants (at least 25!!) like the Schweinchen which I haven't played and can really make things crazy, adding two more trumps and then potentially another 4 if the two keep getting "one-upped", not sure about this one but some of them look good. So far just played the main game which is quite good as is but as usual, I would like to make a tweak or two too and some of these would be a good way to start. 

Overall another excellent trick taker with variable and semi-silent partnerships, great betting, great scoring system (that doesn't thankfully need tweaking) and interesting ways to get points. 

[u]UPDATE[/u] 8.5 => 8.75 Probably a 9 for me, a playtime of about half an hour (addicting enough I have played for a couple of hours though) would be about right and I see tourney rules are 24 hands including 4 compulsory solo rounds, once for each player, interesting... 

I LOVE the bidding and scoring in this game, [i]could be the best I have ever seen in a trad. card game[/i] and it really makes the game. I do wish there were just a couple less trumps like no 10's, guess I could play that way just due to the things I noted above in original comments and I wonder if solo should have an automatic bonus of 2 points if made but you do not have this subtracted if you fail. Solo seems VERY hard to pull off hence my thoughts.

Doko is one of my favorite card games! My friends and I played it once a month for many years. The most interesting part is you don't know who your partner is in most hands until you're part of the way done with them. It's a bit of a blind stab-your-friends-in-the-back game; the best kind!

There is a lot of stuff going on in this card game that is basically a double euchre deck (9 through Aces are used twice in each suit).  Generally, you team with one other person who is often unknown for much of the game to earn 120 points.  Trump composes over half the deck!  The first game or two, one should expect to be constantly referring to the rules to figure out what is trump, etc.  During the game, if you know you have a good hand early, one can make various declarations that will potentially score bonus points for your team OR will score negative if incorrect.  Also, if your team scores one point, the other team will always lose one point for each point of the game.  Odd game but interesting!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Played on BSW and against FreeDoko.  While Doko is a deep trick-taking game that primarily rewards skill, it obtains this at the cost of a baroque sequence of card ranks (even for a traditional trick-taking game), an almost as baroque bidding system, a complex (but not nearly baroque) system for scoring tricks, and an extremely sharp learning curve.  I find myself devoting more effort to figuring out what's going on than I do to my actual play decisions.  I imagine that after a great many sessions, at which point the complex rules would be second nature, this game would really shine, but it's a long haul getting to that point.

UPDATE: Y'know what? Life is too short to wrestle a beast like this to the ground. There are plenty of elegant track taking games that are just as fun, and nearly as deep as this one. A 2.

The rating may be a little low, but this game was a little disappointing after the hype.  It really is a cool game, but I feel like you add a lot complexity for no reason.  I would rather play tichu ten out of ten times.  The moving partners is a sweet mechanic, but I also feel it increases the luck.  In tichu, you may continue to get shafted on the draw, but can rely no your partner getting something.  In this game, you may continue to just be "against" and have the weaker hand over and over.

A very popular German trick taking game played with a truncated deck. More than half the cards are various trumps. The cards and their values are very odd for non-European players. There are several card complications that seem arbitrary. Card play requires giving and receiving hints/signals that come with experience. Overall an OK evening with Europeans but there are many hundreds of games that I enjoy more.

(4 'open' teaching hands for 2 new players followed by 12 plays.)

I like a good trick taking game and Double Sheepshead is no exception.  I find the method of partner selection to be interesting in that it is random and secret until your partner decides to reveal himself or herself.  That is my favorite aspect of Doppelkopf, in fact.

But I do not like all the random things that are actually trump.  I thought trump in pinochle was confusing!  Tens of hearts are higher than all cards, every other ten is pretty much meaningless, queens of clubs are next, followed by queens of spades, then hearts then diamonds.  WTF?  Who came up with this game?

But I do enjoy the trick taking and the intrigue and it is worth learning a new system of what card beats what other cards.

Clearly a great game. But very hard to explain and too many special rules. I understand that this is what makes the game good... ...once you know it. 
It also makes the game horrible to learn.
This is made even worse by the fact that every group has its own special rules, which all go by special names, which then have nick-names again. Great opportunities for banter, but extremely confusing if you are not one of the initiated regulars.

My rating reflects the fact that learning the game is tough going. So much, that I never got sufficiently good at it to really appreciate it.

RATING: 7.8
If Go Fish is an elementary school game, and Hearts is a high school level game, and Bridge or Pinochle is a undergraduate level game, Doppelkopf is by far a graduate level game.  Even with a solid pinochle background to know that 10s are higher than kings, there still is so much complexity here.  It is tricky to try and discover who your partner is, not to mention all the crazy scoring opportunities.  A wonderful card game for those that like a challenge, but it requires dedication to learn and certainly will never work for the casual card player.

This is an excellent trick taking game.  The big problem with this game is that it's relatively difficult to learn, with its non-standard card rankings, odd trump rules, and many little special case rules.  If you've played Sheepshead before it will not be difficult but for those of us who haven't there's a bit of a steep learning curve here.  Still, it's not prohibitive and the game is worth the effort it takes to learn it.

Really great, vaguely pinochle-like trick-taking game, where you discover your partner through the play of each hand. Great for shooting the breeze, but deep enough to hold up under serious play.

This is a tricky to get a handle on at first because of all the unusual details, and then there are a thousand house rules to additionally complicate things. Once you get it down though, it's great fun.

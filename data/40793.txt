Bought it spontaneously at the last day of Essen after we had played it with someone at our hotel the night before. Light, fun poker dice game that works with non-gamers as well as with the more "serious" crowd. A plus: the ultra-loud and annoying sound of the plastic dice cups that come with the game ;)

Interesting dice/poker/auction game.  It is interesting to see which action people go for, and how often the Sheriff's tiebreak ability is relavent.  And while it can be uncommon to get something from Dr Badluck, several of his abilities are very good.

120908 I can see this going down to a 4 soon.  But it was fun enough, but lots of stuff happening and not nearly as interactive as I thought it would be from a rules read.  I think I read a lot of rules with "hope" putting more into the imagined game experience than actually happens.

A chaotic, take-that dice game. I enjoyed my play, but you definitely need the right crowd. I think four players might be the sweet spot. Players need to just enjoy the experience and not care if they win or lose... analytical power gamers will have a terrible time with this one.

My 7.5 rating is based on playing with the excellent expansion. The base game alone would still be a very good 7. This game features loads of luck, and perhaps only the facade of strategy, but it is a roller-coaster ride of highs, lows, stealing, and bribing. It has as much interaction as any game I've played and feels substantial enough to be a real main-event. The production values are brilliant and this tops off a tactile, social, and extremely fun game.

A fast paced dice throwing game with more than enough luck and a touch of strategy, this one is just what you might expect. The theme comes off well and the interplay of dice and results is quite well designed. Good to play with the family. I like it, but don't long to play it.

I loved this game, but seemed to fall a bit flat for my group. Probably my fault though. I added in the expansion on our first play so that made the game go a bit longer than it should have. I'll probably force it on them again, next time just the base game.

RATING: 7
Poker Dice Plus.  Having the most of a specific number yields a particular reward/benefit.  Best poker hand is guaranteed to earn points.  Not getting anything means a visit to Doc Badluck who provides some rather sweet options (not to mention an inherent catch up mechanism).

It's dicey fun, but with a *lot* of give and take.  The dice giveth and your fellow players taketh away.  Money is critical as it is the lubricant for tailoring your hand.  The cards and card-stealing are interesting, but one tends to follow the others.  If your fellow players see you picking up 3 property cards of values 3, 5 and 4, you can be sure that you will be the target of the card thievery.

A fun game.  Not only is it ruled by "luck of the dice," but also by quasi-random thievery.  Very, very random, but also fun.  I'd play this when I'm in the mood for random dice rolling.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is just brilliant! I rarely get so excited for a lighter game like this one, but Dice Town hooked me immediately after one play.

The key of its greatness, in my opinion, is the incredible level of player interaction that it offers: from the way you compete while rolling dice to get the best poker hand, to the short negotiations with the Sheriff every time there's a tie; from the stealing of cards back and forth with the Queen's action to the General Store cards... this game has so much interaction that can make your head spin!

It's an incredibly exciting game and one that brings out big moments of laughter, cheering and backstabbing. It's just a great experience!

On top of that, the game looks gorgeous and the components are absolutely fantastic... with the sad exception of the paper money. Yet it doesn't matter that much, because I absolutely love the dice! They just look and feel great. I don't even care about how dice look usually and yet somehow these are so good that they actually improve the gaming experience for me.

I'm so glad to have this game in my collection. I'm sure it's a title that will see a lot of table time, as it's so quick and easy to bring out. Great and yet simple design... just fantastic!

In Dice Town you roll dice trying to get the best kind of poker hands on the dice for the best benefit. It really is as simple as that. Plays in less than 30 minutes (at least we know that for a fact with 2 players) but still gives you some strategic choices to make along the way. This is very easily a gateway game that you can teach to someone who knows cards but has never touched a designer board game in their life.

Don't be fooled: this game might have dice but it is anything but a pure luck-driven game. Dice Town is all about luck-management wich is something completely different. It has alot of interesting dillema's for such a lighter game and the dice cup and optimal roll selection part is so addictive. For me this is the best lighter game in my collection and a modern classic that cen be played both with gamers and non gamers.

I enjoyed as a quick filler, but my four opponents were happy to abandon 2/3rds of the way through the game.  Lots of dice.  Picking on your opponents.  But enough to think about to retain interest.  Its not Bluff/Liar's Dice, but it makes a change.

It's fun pushing your luck with the dice, or sometimes at the very last roll get a perfect 'full house' or 4 or 5 of a kind, and beating the other player's “certain” hand.
The game is quite fast and has just enough backstabbing and messing with one another.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
a very fast flowing game of "take that" mixed with a little push your luck.  

If you don't like luck in your games, you will hate this one.  If you don't like it when players can steal your cards (especially if they KNOW what you have) you will positively despise it.

I love it.

Ez a játék mindent kihoz, amit a pókerkockából ki lehet. Eredeti ötletek, szép kivitel. Nem díjazza az egysíkú stratégiát, több lábon kell állni (pénz, arany, kártyák, seriffség...). Elég sok kiegyenlítő mechanizmus van beépítve, nehéz elhúzni a többiektől.

Een soort pokerspel, maar er zit weinig bluf-element in; veels te veel gelukselementen.

Tips:
- Doctor bad luck brengt je vaak méér op dan iets anders en het heeft je geen geld gekost.
- Anders best spelen op het afpakken van een kaart (saloon): Je krijgt een kaart, en bovendien pakken ze er geen van jou af in die beurt.

This is another easy hit.  It's easy to grasp after a few rounds and there is just enough of a mix of strategy and chance that it's typically anyone's game.  There are a few things that can mean that last couple of points for the win at the end like going for the Sheriff or barb wiring the high scoring properties, but overall you can win on your first try with a group of intermediate players.

Borrowed a german language copy of this and the printed english rules we found in the box were so bad, that it was easier to read the german version, even though I haven't studied or used german in almost 10 years.

Well, pardner, if you chuck a bunch of dice on the table I'm bound to enjoy the game at least somewhat. And, sure enough, I enjoy this game. I will say that the one problem I have discovered after playing a couple times is that the game can go a bit long with the wrong players.  Never, ever, ever play this game with people that suffer from analysis-paralysis.  Aside from that minor complaint (one that could be made about tons of games) I find this game to be a total blast! The way that the mechanisms insure that each player will at least get some type of benefit from their turn is really nice. The game definitely has an element of bluff in it, and a healthy dose of back-stabbing as people steal cards and such. I think the aspect of bribing the sheriff to win ties is really creative as well.  With the right crowd this could be one of my favorite dice games, and that's saying a lot.  Unfortunately my parents (one of my primary "game groups") is not the right crowd...

Really had high hopes, but it's about 20-30 minutes too long for what it is.  Hiding your dice and picking them out from under this tiny cup, also, just does not work well.  I wanted fast-paced, die-rolling fun, but instead it dragged on, and on, and on ...

Κερδισα το παιχνιδι σε μια κληρωση που εγινε για τα μελη του Greek Guild, με παιχνιδια που χαρισε η Καισσα.
Very nice artwork by the same guy that did Mr Jack. The designers' credits include Shadows over Camelot which I don't like and Mr Jack which I like. 
Judging from the box it is not a game that I would go out and buy but when I opened it, saw the components and read the rules I was very pleased. [-]I will try a two players game soon.[/-]

Extremely satisfying game, it keeps you involved all the time, it's challenging, it's fun, it has suspense. Highly recommended to gamers and non-gamers.

If you like dice games, then you owe it to yourself to track down a copy of this game.  It's a great production with high quality components and cool poker dice.  The game is LOUD as all hell.  People slam down their dice cups each turn and it's all part of the silly fun.  Excellent game that doesn't overstay it's welcome and can be easily taught to anyone.

This was fun and different from Pony Express, which I initially compared it to.  You still have to go for cards as they are key.  It was also quick and did not wear out it's welcome.  A good, light game.

Update:  if I track this one down I must have the expansion with it.  I think it adds alot to the game and has made it a game I want to get now.

Dice Town is a fun game for families and an excellent filler for serious gamers. Ultimately all dice-rolling games come down to luck, but Dice Town gives you plenty of control over how to build your 'hand' of dice. The theme is rich and well integrated, and the play is fast with no down time at any time. Play to win and you might be disappointed. Play for the fun of screwing your opponents and you will have a great time.

RATING: 5.5
An okay light strategy game with a Yahtzee-esque push-your-luck dice mechanic.  There's a lot more going on than Yahtzee because the dice are used (poker-style) to "bid" on several items that give you points or advantages.  There's enough stealing and "take that" for a bit of player interaction but it's usually not excessive.  FWIW, the stealing is usually a gold nugget or a random card from a player's hand so it doesn't provide a significant catch-the-leader mechanism.  Not a very meaty game, but it takes too long to be a filler.

Very chaotic dice game, which is way to long for what is it. 30 min for such game would be the max, but 60 is just too long.
Vp finals tend to range around 15 - 30 pts. In every round you can loose around 8 points. So often the game comes down to the last round. 
Also to fiddle the dice you want to discard behind your hand and your cup is not well done.

Es un juego de mayorías a base de dados, ambientado en el oeste. Aquél que obtenga la mayoría en cada uno de los valores posibles del dado, ejerce la acción asociada a dicho valor (obtener pepitas de oro, atracar el banco, obtener cartas de general store, robar cartas a los oponentes, proclamarse sheriff). La mejor jugada se lleva cartas de propiedad. Aquellos que no hayan obtenido nada, pueden al final optar a una acción "de consolación". Las cartas aportan variaciones sobre las reglas que le dan vidilla al juego. LA partida continúa hasta que se agotan las pepitas o las propiedades. Gana el que consigue más puntos de victoria (que se obtienen por pepitas, dinero y propiedades). Está bastante entretenido, aunque los primeros turnos pueden resultar un poco liosos.

One of my friends accurately described this game as "Luck Management" There is a high luck factor in the dice rolling, but there's a lot you can do to move forward in your own personal strategy even within the confines of the dice rolls. The game plays quickly and "turns" are done at the same time which keeps everyone enganged the whole game.

Fun game that seemed to be a little longer than I expected.  There are a few decisions to be made, but as the name might imply a lot comes down to luck.  Still, a fun light game.

Did not really work as a two-player game. Rulebook is HORRIBLE and virtually useless. The expansion is also poorly explained and seems hahazardly thrown onto the base game.

Wow, this game is bad, bad, bad. A take-that dice-fest which is not provably terminating. Awesome. But it's got poker dice! Really, this is a terrible game. Reminds me a bit of alea iacta est, without the quality. Admittedly, alea iacta est is a serious game, which Dice Town is not; but even for a dice game that prioritized "fun" over quality, this is still terrible - over long, unbalanced, repetitive, grinding, and pointless.

RATING: 4
I'm usually a fan of dice games, but just didn't care for this one all that much.  The game is way too long for a dice game in which you have little control over anything.  You can try to shoot for different things, but you generally just end up getting the reward that corresponds to whatever you ended up rolling.  If I get a bunch of 9's, I'm going to get gold.  If I get a bunch of 10's, I'm going to be robbing the bank.  Heck, near the end of the game, it's even good to just roll a bunch of junk, as the consolation prize becomes worth more than the prizes that you're actually meant to be shooting for!  There just aren't any meaningful decisions to be made, which is usually fine in a dice game, but not a game that's an hour long!

I'm always looking for good lightweight games for the family, and some solid reviews had me curious to try Dice Town. After one play, I'm cautiously optimistic. I like the way players keep dice one after another and build up a hand that forces other players to play against. With everyone rolling at once, everyone is involved.

Our first game seemed to last a little long, but then again, we didn't focus on those 9s and Aces to whittle down the end game conditions. I'll be curious to see if this holds up with more plays.

Update: 5 plays, and this is a solid game worth keeping. It has been well-received as a lunchtime option with work peers. 

Update: ...and traded away. Not a bad game, but nobody at lunch was lobbying to play this one. It's a nice dice game but a shade below some better options.

It looks fun. And it also has a ton of poker dice, which can be used for a whole lot of other games.

The expansion probably adds a bit more flair, but it's still exciting, and it's one game that I can finally play with my parents without them grumbling.

It's fallen out of favour with them, and with me as well, since nobody in my group is keen on it. Sold it.

Combining poker and dice doesn't seem that interesting on the surface, so it's impressive how this game evolved from that combination.  Roll and decide what to keep secretly, but you need the most/best in an area to get the benefit.  Can you outsmart the other players?  And steal the best cards to help you out?

While the learning curve on this one was a bit steeper than expected, once you dive in it falls into place and it's a good time.  Definitely one I'll be looking out for to acquire.

Components: Great artwork for the board and the cards. The poker dice are functional. The money, though small, works surprisingly well.

Experience: I was skeptical of the keep-only-one-die rule at first, but it ends up being such a nail-biting source of contention. Usually all or almost all of the town's buildings are attractive, but the competition can be vicious, whether for the Bank because we're low on cash, or for the Saloon to steal (or keep another player from stealing), or for the Town Hall when there are some juicy claims on display. Very fun, and plays quickly.

The Saloon is too powerful, especially in a two-player game, when stealing a 5-point claim card is a 10-point swing. Or the 8-point horse is a 16-point swing! We play with a variant that winning the Saloon entitles the winning player to draw one random card, regardless of the number of queens rolled. Even then, the game usually comes down to who has the horse.

Been playing with the expansion recently. More fun, as players gain more goodies each turn, and the importance of some of the general store cards is lessened. But it does get a bit chaotic with 6 players.

Not sure how to rate this properly, as my only play included the expansion (and I don't know what was added by the exp.). It's a decent dice rolling/poker hand sort of game, although the poker hand only really counts toward getting land (worth VPs, but there are other ways to earn VPs). 

Having money seemed to be either feast or famine in my game. Lots of "take that" by using the Doc Badluck actions as well as the General Store cards, which are vary greatly in their power and usefulness. 

Fun game to play once in a while, although it does run a tad long for what it is.

Take Liar's Bluff dice rolling. Add some blind selection (ala Basari). Sprinkle with action cards and punitive "steal from the leader" mechanisms.

Its quite fun and worth a few laughs, but I found all the take-that mechanisms distracted from the enjoyment of the dicerolling poker hand building.
Paying to keep/remove extra dice is a great addition to the gambling choices too.

I think the poker rolling system for this game is great.  However, I'm not a fan of games that use "take that" to keep players in check.  No one is good enough to exactly evaluate who should be attacked at any one time, so then it comes down to politics.  Ugh.

As advertised, it's easy and luck-driven.  Beware the take that element, as people WILL steal your best cards.  If you can play without taking it seriously, this is a fun semi-filler (its play time is a little long for a true filler).

Might make an okay shockwave game where the turns weren't so loud and annoying, and the turn resolution wasn't so chaotic.  But then the game would still suck.  I think there could be something in the core mechanic though.  Just not this.

This rolls up some poker, yahtzee, and a take-that element into an Old West theme.   Don't get too attached to your scoring cards, because they are easily stolen.  The game is very repetitive, and sometimes lasts a few turns longer than necessary.  Another frustration is that the catch-up actions for people who got nothing each round are often better than the main spaces, which creates a weird wrinkle in the game since sometimes you'll want to do poorly - but that's easier said than done.  The theme fits well, I just wish it was a little easier to hang on to your cards.  Sure, it's fun with a good, light-hearted group, but that's about it.   (p.s.  by far, the loudest game I own.)

Hárman próbáltuk ki, de meglepően jól működött. Valójában egy kockapóker megfűszerezve vadnyugati tematikával és taktikus, interaktív játékmenettel. Ügyes megoldás, hogy nem egy dobásból határozzuk meg, hogy kinek mit sikerült dobni, hanem úgy rakjuk össze egyesével (pénzért többet is lehet egyszerre) az 5 kockás készletünket, melyet egymással összevetve, kiderül, hogy kinek mit sikerült szerezni. Lehet pontot gyűjteni aranyrögökkel, telek szerzéssel és még a boltban vásárolt lapokkal is. Lehet egymástól lopni és a bankot kirabolni és a seriff dönt a vitás kérdésekben. Egyszerű, de nagyszerű játékmenet, amit a család apraja nagyja képes egymással játszani. (2015.01.01.)

Kicsit póker alapú pörgős játék. Kockadobások (5 kocka/fő)titokban a saját kockákkal, egy ingyen (vagy pénzért több) kocka kiválasztása, félretétel, ezt már látja mindenki. Majd új dobás titokban, kiválaszt.... ha mind az 5 kocka kiválasztásra került, jön az értékelés. (Ha vki előbb végez a kockái kiválasztásával, akkor a többieknek egy utolsó körük van, viszont ingyenes a több kocka is)
Dice town egyes helyeit értékeljük: legtöbb 9-es, legtöbb 10-es, legtöbb J, Legtöbb D, Legtöbb király, legjobb pókerkombináció. Mindegyiknél mást kaphat az ember: aranyat, pénzt, vegyesboltkártyák (amik vagy segítségek, vagy bónuszpont a végén), lopikálás /egy játékostól annyi lap, ahány D a dobónál, 1 megtart, többi visszaad/, seriff választása /ő dönt a döntetleneknél -megvesztegethető-/, ingatlankártya-szerzés (Pont a végén). és van a  peches Doki: ha vki semmit nem nyert a körben csinálhat dolgokat (igatlanmentés, egyéb). Új kör. Addig míg vagy minden aranyrög elfogy v minden ingatlan elfogy.
Egyszerű játékmenet, jó egyes többség értékelések, a seriff se rossz, gyors. A pókerság gyakorlatilag csak az ingatlannál, hisz a többinél egyszerű adott kocka többség. De miután válogatás, lehet tervezni, mit akar az ember megszerezni, meg hát látja többiek mit dobtak, érdemes-e csatázni érte, de hát persze kockadobás. Nekem tetszik, ha nem húzódik el túlságosan, akkor nagyon jó, könnyed játék. (Elsőre gyorsan lenyomtuk)

With a fair amount of screwage with card stealing, I was slightly surprised how much I enjoyed this.  While luck is present, there are still many choices to be made in choosing between special power cards, tie-break decider, money, victory point gold nuggets, and even deliberately choosing a bad poker hand.  Plus there is just something inherently fun about building poker hands with dice.  I do agree it seems slightly long for what it is but that seems easy to fix with a variant that removes some end game condition pieces.

A hybrid between Yahtzee and Poker. The comic artwork is perfect for such a fun fast party-style game, and the gameplay is tense and with some mean twists. Dice Town offers interesting tactical decisions (what symbols do I go for this round? do I lay pressure on my opponents in ending the round early?...) and plays very quickly. Overall a perfect game to start/end a gaming-night.

RATING: 8
In the month or so since I purchased this game, I've had it requested during every single game night. There's something about Dice Town that just brings out the laughter and enjoyment in a group. It's not deep or analytical, but the gasps and cries of frustration as someone beats your dice hand are terrible in a really fun way. 

Dice Town's theme isn't all that strong, but the gameplay more than makes up for any shortcomings. The ability to influence your dice rolls with money and cards adds a welcome touch of strategy, and having bonuses given to players who don't win any hands prevents any runaway leader problems. 

Once everyone learns the different poker hands and their results, the playing time should drop to under 45 minutes. And there's practically no downtime--a welcome feature for a game that plays best with 4 or 5. I've had a game with 3 players, but it fell a bit flat. As with a lot of other games, there really needs to be competition for resources for Dice Town to shine.

The game's very well-produced, but there are still opportunities for pimpage. I'm going to replace the paper money with poker chips and the sheriff's card with an actual badge.

I'm sure our plays will eventually slow down, but for now this is the hot game in our group. It never fails to put a smile on everyone's face, and there's a hefty amount of lighthearted screwage. I think Dice Town might be my favorite game released in 2009 (so far).

Despite the gambling theme, this is a fun family game. While the die rolling is mostly luck there are cards you can use to change your fate or mess with other players. Plus, the hand (and thus prize you'll win) you play, will be based on what other players appear to be targeting as well as what you need. So, there is planning involved as you work out what you want your strategy to be.

Great partyish game.  Plays better with more than 2 players.  Seems like this game really plays best with at least 4.  Have not tried the expansion yet.  Seems like it sometimes takes half a game for new players to realize that a good 'poker hand' isn't necessarily the best - good large sets is better (think yahtzee).  Once they get that, the game gets really interesting as everyone is watching what everyone else is doing.  Really fun reaction when multiple people show the same starting save or when someone beats them out by one.

I saw a dice tower review for this one and really wanted to try it. Adam provided that opportunity and I believe the expansion was included.

I am glad I got the chance to play it however I didn't particularly enjoy this game. It felt very chaotic especially the dice rolling in rounds aspect and the group got noisier and nosier whilst this was happening and thus I felt that I was trailing behind in the amount of rounds I was supposed to roll my dice for, however this is a minor issue and didn't affect the game too much. 

There is a really nice benefit for rolling the most of any one symbol and for the best poker hand however having the sheriff and thus breaking ties means you tend to get a lot of bribes as a group we all failed in this as we continued to give one player the coins he needed to keep getting the victory point cards.

I think there is a nice level of interaction here however I felt our group was too noisy and focused on what they were doing to allow Adam to run the game efficiently.

A smaller group may have helped with this and I certainly wouldn't mind trying this one again.

The action cards that Adam has added are really nice as it prevents any tensions about visiting Dr Badluck at the end of the round.

First off let me say that I am not a very big fan of Liar's Dice and don't quite see how the two can be compared to each other. When the only similarities are of rolling the dice. Once the dice have been rolled. Dice Town takes off in it's own direction and totally blows Liars Dice away. 

Wow what an exciting and fun game. The components are excellent and very well produced. The gameboard is bright and beautiful. Everything looks great and works well with the flow of the game. The rules are fairly short and very easy to understand and the game can be played shortly after opening the box. It's very easy to teach/learn and full of laughter and fun.

Although game play does take a little longer than what I would consider a filler. It does play out in a decent amount of time and doesn't overstay it's weloome. In fact: I can see most people including myself wanting to play again and again. It's just that much fun. I would highly recommend this game to everyone.

Nice and fun dice game with a little twisted rules and a lot of negative interaction. It's the Wild West after all :-)

I wouldn't play it with neither my family (interaction and rules) nor with my gamer friends (lightness). So who is its target group?

This game is a lot of fun.  I'm not the biggest fan of poker, but I understand its appeal.  This game has some poker elements such as bluffing and trying to get the best hand to suit your needs, but it uses dice instead of cards.   I like the special buildings that give you powers for the turn and I like the length.  About 90 minutes. Have Expansion

With no downtime and lots of competition for the spaces in town, I can see how Dice Town would be delightful with three or more players, and would rate it a 7. With two players, though, it is so dull that I would rate it a 5.  I'm giving it a 6 as an average and removing it from my collection because we rarely have more than 2 players.

Played with 6 people using an expansion.  The game really falls apart with this many people and takes *forever*.

For those who like dice games, but wish that they were more random.  Well, perhaps that's a little harsh, and it's more amusing than it sounds, even though it's a mad dicefest with stealing from other places added on top.  The theme seems to fit, and there's some element of light strategy: you can hoard cash to better manipulate rolls in future turns.

RATING: 6
A fun little dice game using poker dice and hand ranking to reward players with various items. Beautiful and clean artwork, though a lot of the text and iconography was too small.

I enjoyed this one, but I think the game is a little flawed. There's something wrong when the strongest hand can actually reap the lowest reward. Still, there are some interesting choices around how best to play your dice and when to cut and run.

Excellent & funny dice-fest.  The game is played with special "poker dice" which depict the cards 9, 10, J, Q, K, Ace.  Players roll dice simultaneously in order to win certain actions (for example, the player who rolls the most 9s gets a nugget per 9 which scores one VP each, wheras the player who rolls the best poker combination gets one or more cards scoring 1-4 VP).  Other dice results give action cards or allow players to steal cards or VP.  The game is light and fast, not very tactical but quite funny.  Recommended for everyone who likes dice games as a good 30-minute filler game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A dice game with some choices, but still very random, and not only because of the dice. There is also a lot of chaos, annoying take-that elements (mainly stealing cards), very unbalanced cards and a high dosage of luck of the draw. Very impractical dice cups, too! Maybe not a bad game in its genre, but certainly not my type of game.

I had irrational hopes for this one based on the cute dice mechanic, but it's standard Faidutti fare--wild and imbalanced. You want to draw and hold the big point cards, and then steal others--but the only way to protect yourself from being stolen from is to steal yourself, so the endgame can degenerate.

This is a fun game for 4-6 players.  It is poker with dice where rewards are given for having the most of each dice type as well as having the best hand.  You even can get rewarded for not winning anything!  There is plenty of player interaction (bribing, stealing of cards, lying, and bluffing).  With the right group this game is a blast.  Table talk is encouraged and makes this game even better.

I had this game on my wishlist for a while as it seemed like a very interactive dice game with some bluffing.  Turns out that was right for the most part, and one of our other group members bought it so I didn't have to.

I ended up liking it a lot.  It doesn't punish you with lucky rolls too much since every die can get you something.  The money aspect also gives you a lot of legroom with how much reroll or extra dice you're using and keeping.  The card stealing is an interesting idea as it makes you keep an eye on what you've got.  It also makes you consider losing all normal routes to defend a couple point cards.

Overall pretty interesting for a dice game.  It's pretty quick to play and easy to learn with a high fun factor and a bit of bluffing and screwage.  Not quite enough depth to hold for too long but I'd certainly play it again.

Playing this game will be a lot of fun. Despite the poker driven game-play shaking and slamming the dice cups is the best part.

This game has only one disadvantage - there isn't a strategy player could follow. Luck is the main factor that determines the winner of game. But since this is a 2-5player game, it is for sure that there will be a lot of fun in any company while playing this game.

Heh, the more I play this game, the more I like it. :D

Fast playing 30 minute dice game where everything is based on either suits or poker hands (majority of a suit or best poker hand wins).  Subject to luck of the roll which some people really dislike.  Strategy is a little limited but much of the fun comes from the poker quality of the dice hands, the speed of play, and a large screw your friend component.  This is a sound filler game that anyone can learn fast.

Mar10:

It was a good idea, but poorly executed.  The default "lock one die" per turn makes the dice rolling take *forever*.  If the default was "lock them all" then at least it would be over in less than 60 minutes.

The dice fighting and comparison was pretty good.

The cards were fricking random.  (Range from value of 2-8, draw well.)

I suppose it might succeed on the beer&pretzel front, but I'd like to see it play faster for that even.

A dice rolling game grafted on wild west theme. The important part of game is action selections made by players with their dice. Just like the other dice rolling game, the game aspect of Dice Town is also mainly determined by the result of dice. Because of the wild west background, furthermore, the game ignites more struggles among players. Dice Town easily aggravates players more than other dice rolling games. For me, it was not a good experience. Unfortunately, the game and I were a total awful match.

Interesting light game accessible to non-gamers.  Roll your Poker themed dice.  The winners of certain categories (most kings, most queens, etc.) get some sort of bonus action.  You try to get the most points, mostly by buying territory cards but there are other ways.  Not a brain burner but you do need to think about how you want to use each roll and which dice to reroll.  Light fun.

"Interactive Yahtzee" is how I describe it. Very easy to learn but takes about half a game or so (20 minutes of play) to "get" how to win - which you can't really describe. I can tell you what gives you points but knowing when to go for the Saloon vs going for the Gold Mine is a matter of experience.

Easily learned and surprisingly interactive, this has really delighted nearly everyone who has tried it so far. (I bought it after playing it once and I believe one of my friends is going to buy a copy after I played it with him once.)

Fun light game. Dice Town is perfect to introduce new people (or family) to our beloved hobby. It is very easy to teach as it uses very know/popular game mechanics at its core (Poker and Yahtzee). The art and game components are pretty good.

It is very light for me AND it has lots of uncontrollable luck (dice and cards), but I will definitely play if requested. With the right crowd this can be a blast and I plan to buy it in the future to play it with my non gamer family.

This is a great little dice game. Push your luck, screw your neighbor, a little light negotiation. The decisions are interesting, but not terribly difficult. It's not a brain burner or anything, but it's a lot of fun.

Dice Town is a truly awesome game.  Rolling dice, mining for gold, robbing banks, shopping at the General Store, stealing from your opponents, becoming sheriff and working with the mayor to get property.  Anything's possible in this wild west themed game.  Very rarely do dice chucking games tie in a theme, but this one does it in amazing and fun fashion.  I love it.

RATING: 10
Very fun dice chucking game, you throw dice saving one at a time untill you have all five dice, you are aiming to make the best poker hand with your dice rolls (They have poker faces on) and depending on what you rolled will determine which actions you win. 

Lots of fun, easy to play.

My nongamer wife liked this one. Roll the five dice and then keep one or pay to keep more. Continue rolling. Try to get the best poker hand to win property. Having the most of 9's through K's brings other benefits such as cash or special cards. It is a nice light game.

RATING: 6
Uprated from 7 without expansion to 8 with expansion.

The addition of the 2nd place roles and the integration of Dr Bad luck actions into the "main game" actions has really turned this game into what it should have been in the first place.

I have yet to play with the Indian as I felt that added an extra layer of rules while teaching new players.

Overall - an excellent game for 6 with the expansion - essential purchase!

A great game of brinksmanship, terrific with family or larger groups of casual gamers - you're not going to burn your brain on this one. Roll poker dice to create the best hand, pay to keep extra dice, rob the stagecoach, pan for gold... So much fun to be had. Terrific as a filler, or as a starter to get everyone loosened up and having fun.

After one play this is a strong 6/10 and possibly 7/10. I might be biased because I won. Typical French chaos game in best Faidutti tradition, this time with poker dice where you have to get the most of one symbol or most valuable combinations to receive several benefits or use some roles. Leaves room for some decision but in the end the player wins who gets hit on the least. Which probably will lead to not reaching 7/10.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun light-hearted strategic game as long as one is okay with the "what is mine may soon be taken from me" chaotic play. There's strategy, but it's easy to gain and loose stuff, and so people who dislike messy interference or player-vs-player hostility may not like this. Plays much better with the expansion.

RATING: 7
I can see why many would really dislike this game, but for me, if played quickly, it's fun enough to play every now and then.

Pros: I like the artwork and the theme.  It's easy to teach to just about anyone.  They do a good job making all the action cards simple enough that a new player does not have to ask what it means.

Cons: I wish the cups were a little bigger, and it feels awkward having to sneak (or fake sneaking) dice out of the cup.  Also, there is a little too much stealing going on, and some cards are so nice (like the 8 point card) that it will get stolen back and forth.  I wish there was a way to protect your cards more easily than with the Doc Badluck option.

Still, it's a lighthearted romp, and I'd gladly play as long as I knew it would take under 45 minutes.  30 minutes would be preferable.  Playing with any AP-types would completely kill the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A little more strategy than I had been lead to believe.  Sometimes it's better not to try for a better hand and instead look at what your opponents are likely to go for.  Then if you can get two or three other categories you can do a lot with what appears to be a cruddy hand.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A dice rolling filler. There's hardly any skill involved in this one. By itself, it does run too long but that is easily tweaked. Non-gamers seem to like it well enough, so I guess it will come out when the mood strikes.

RATING: 7
Very enjoyable luck-driven game.  If I felt as if I had more control of my destiny I would rate it a bit higher.  But, still, I think it will always be an enjoyable romp.

I enjoy this one.  The custom poker dice are well made (if a little hard to read initially) and the mechanic of rolling them together as a group and racing to make poker hands is fun.  I like the flow of the game, how it plays, and I like how the cards from the General Store add powerful options to your gameplay.  It's just a good time.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I like the simple majority/poker-hand duality of your roll. The "pay money to keep more dice", coupled with "when one player's done, only one roll left" means that you get information from each player's hand at different speed, and a variable number of rolls makes for interesting push-your-luck. I also like to have the option of paying 4$ to keep my initial roll and make others panic. However, Dice Town is long for what it is, and would be better in half the time.

Poker dice, western theme and yahtzee-style dice rolling for majorities and poker hands make for one of the best dice games out there. 

No interest in playing it with 2 players but any other number of players from 3-6 (5-6 with expansion) is fine by me :)

A very good game that has many avenues to victory. I like the dice mechanic to form a poker hand. I find that it plays well with 2 - 5 players with doc bad-luck adding in something extra with the higher player count. It does stress me out however about the possibility of losing some of the gold nuggets as they are a game end condition so would shorten the game if lost. Highly recommended.

The core game mechanics underlying this game are quite clever.  Dice-rolling games seem to be all the rage right now and this one brings an interesting wrinkle to the game by utilizing poker dice rather than normal dice.  Unfortunately, the execution was lacking.  The utility of the game board actions varied wildly in as did the range of the point value cards.  Not for me.

Dice Town Extension
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Dice Town is a quick and simple dice game that, above all, is fun. It basically is a Yahtzee on steroids with a western theme that, even if not immersive, it is as thematic as a pure dice game can get.

Firstly, players roll dice like in Yahtzee, though they have to pay to the bank if they want to keep more than one dice (or none at all). When the dice rolling is over, the player with the majority in each of the symbols earns a benefit (sheriff decides ties), which can be points, money, cards (either drawing or stealing from another player) or the sheriff. Also, the best poker play earns terrain cards, which are the primary way of scoring. If you fail to earn anything in a round you can perform a special action.

Dice town wins as a fun dice game with ways to interact with other players, both by competition and by stealing them cards and money. The main flaw of the game is that the symbols of the action cards are hideous. Seriously, after more than ten games I can only identify what two or three cards do without consulting the rulebook. And I am quite used to these kind of symbols from other games.

Want a fun, light, Yahtzee style game with a bit of interaction and theme? Then this is your best option.

The dutch rules switches to french halfway through in my version...

Well it's a very light game with plenty of luck. Some memory skills will help too. 

Normally this would be enough for me to stay far away from the game for me but I enjoyed my play. As did the others.

It's light, amusing and the "screwage" factor adds to the fun.

SO wuld I play it again ? Probably yes.

Will I suggest playing it ? Only with no gamers.

If I have to compare it with one game I'll say cash and guns. If you want a little more game this is the one you want. If you want the flavour you'll pick cash and guns...

Each player gets a cup with five poker dice and eight dollars. Each turn a player will put together a poker hand and depending on the roll, take control of various key places in Dice Town that will allow him to perform the corresponding action of the location.

In a turn, all players shake their cup and take out all but one die which is kept apart. They repeat the process with the remaining dice until all five dice are on the table. Players may want to keep more than one die; they pay one dollar for each additional die.

Played once with six players and I suspect that's not even close to being an optimum number.  I like the ideas of this more than the execution of it (combined together).  The major thing I dislike about it is that it motivates and offers incentive to pick on the lagging or weaker players.  If you fall behind, leading players will still likely pick on you b/c they are trying to accumulate more points, doesn't matter who it is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
While not anything I really truly love, this game is actually fairly enjoyable if people aren't too intense in gaming the system.  Poker with dice and special actions can lead to a good time and the sheriff role can be quite, er, crooked!  The fact that the sheriff will sometimes give you a certain role so that you cannot get the chance action at the end also is quite clever.  Still, this is a dice game and as such, usually not something I look to play.

RATING: 6
Szerencsejáték, de mégis úgy érzem, hogy sok lehetőség van a játékban: akármit is dobok a kockákkal, valamiben valószínűleg én leszek a legjobb, és tudok előre haladni a győzelem felé. Ha nagyon rosszakat dobnék, akkor meg a vigaszdíj miatt lehet előre haladni, szóval szerencse híján is azt lehet érezni, hogy jó a játék - van benne sikerélmény mindenki számára.
És interakció is akad, bőven, hiszen figyelni kell mások már kidobott kockáira, egyenlőség esetén pedig meg kell (lehet) vesztegetni a seriffet, hogy számunkra kedvezően döntsön. Érdemes számon tartani azt is, hogy kinek milyen lapok lehetnek a kezében, hiszen lopáskor jól jön ez az információ.
A játék a kockadobások miatt elég nagy hangzavarral jár, de jó társaságban, pl. egy kocsma egyik asztalánál játszva nagyszerű estét képes szerintem teremteni az összes játékos számára. (4-5 játékos esetén a legjobb, mi öten játszottuk.) Előnye a játéknak az is, hogy a kockadobás fizikai mozgással jár, hogy nincs holtidő, hogy viszonylag rövid játékidejű (irányadóan fél óra) és végig pörgős ütemű a játék. Legfőbb erőssége szerintem a játékélmény.
Örülök, hogy megismertem, vannak értékei, tetszik!

Dice Town can be a funny bird at times. It is definitely not a game where you can reliably depend upon a set strategy to win the game. The dice and other players can assure you of that. What it does require you to do is take a chance on locking your dice and hope that it turns out for the best. It really is a risk/reward style game that encourages you to shoot for the moon as often as possible. I really do enjoy the multiplayer game compared to the two player game. i also think it is essential that you won the expansion which adds a lot more depth to the game. I wouldn't play with out it. The components are also pretty good, although I have a couple of my poker dice with different color faces for their Kings and Queens which bugs the crap out of me. Overall its a fun little family game that provides fun for those who enjoy risk taking and gambling.

Early reports compared this to an old favorite, Liar’s Dice, and I grabbed it expecting a strong bluffing element. There’s not one. What there is, however, is a fun time with a lot of action, trash talk, and a surprising amount of strategy. Every group I’ve played this with seems to like it, and everyone’s eager to give it a try. A really well-done, fun, attractive game.

Terrible Tiny Useless Icons on the board, what is the deal with that? Since they didn't read the rules before publishing them (Drugstore, anyone?), it seems that maybe no one played the game with the as-published components neither. The pictures of the board in the rule book is how they should have done the board icons; maybe there was a printing error when the actual boards got printed.

Looks like a player aid is needed for the less-eagle-eyed to play.

Simple yahtzee style dice rolling game.  Roll five dice and try to put together the best poker hands.  If you get the most nines you get gold nuggets, most 10's you can steal from the bank, most j's you get a general store card, most q's you can steal a card from another player, most k's you get to be sheriff.  Best hand you get scoring cards.  

It is a game that is ok, with out the expansion, but with this expansion is great.  Very fun with the expansion and a good "next step" game beyond a family weight game.

Fun dice fest. Like Yahtzee with Poker. Perhaps worth getting when the price comes down from $30
Quick play.

It looks fun, but some find it boring. Considering the price this is definitely a "try before I buy" game.

This is a great dice game. Luck plays a part, but there's plenty of strategy, loads of interaction, and a great theme. This would make a fantastic gateway game. Since we've gotten it, it's seen the table a lot.

Strangely, since adding the expansion to the game, I've never wanted to play it. Probably because the expansion added extra actions without providing a board that explains them, making this a much less newbie-friendly game. That's not a slight on the base game though.

Played only as 2 player with my son - great fun, not too much "take that" but enough that he's getting the concept.  Lots of math, planning, looking at other information available... a great family game.  My guess is it would be a "10" rating with 3 or more.  I'm going to get the Extension.

Played once and we made some rules mistakes, so take this with a grain of salt, but I feel I won't like this game even with the correct rules - too long for a luck-based game, you can waste an entire turn if you go for something and somebody just happens to go for the same thing and does it slightly better.

This game is really, really fun to me.  It's light and since it relies on dice, it's pretty dependent on luck.  But rolling poker hands is fun and gives me that gambling feel that I loved when I played Texas Hold'em.  

I love the screw your neighbor aspect that can make things very swingy.  I recommend you don't play with people who make dumb alliances (like sappy husband/wife teams or easily manipulated sheep).   

I also LOVE how the sheriff breaks ties.  I love the power.  I often lose simply because I want to control the sheriff.

Really not a bad little game for what it is.  It's a dice game, where you make some fun choices, take some risks, and sometimes just get really lucky (or unlucky.)  The theme is fun too.  I found it a bit hard to see some of the dice icons on the board and dice - but wasn't horrible.  I think I would have preferred just a big "J" on the dice instead of a graphical jack (same with king and queen of course).  Just a minor little detail though.  There are other dice games, but this one will get a recommendation from me based on the fun theme, and the role of the "sheriff" is really fun too.

Fun, fast, and well-executed. It feels very French; that's a good thing. There's a surprising amount of depth given the simplicity of the rules (very accessible to non-gamers) and the play length.

There's a healthy dose of luck, but it's fun luck -- and not at all out of place, given the theme and core mechanic. Just a solid game overall, and fun to play (and to lose); after playing, it makes me want to play again to see if I can do better.

Apart from the paper money, which is decent quality but still paper money, the components are fantastic. The bullet dice cups really make it hum.

This didn't see enough action to justify keeping it. Re-rated from a 7 to a 6 and sold.

This is a NASTY little game. If you've played Tammany Hall, then you know what I'm talking about. Backstabbing, kingmaking, bribery and deceit--it's all present here. Part of the nastiness, is what makes this one fun. The idea of fierce competition and screwage gels with the theme quite well. The components are pretty decent (engraved dice and gold nuggets, etc). The fact that this game has paper money is a bit of a turn off, but I can substitute something else, I guess. The dice rolling is fun and surprisingly strategic. If you have thick skin, you should give this a try.

Yes there is luck (we're talking about DICEtown after all), but the game gets the players talking and posturing in fun ways and there is a bit more control than you might think. In my two games I actually decided before the start of play what to go after (Queens/Best Hand and then Nuggets/Best Hand). The fact it worked both times suggests that there is room for a bit of strategy.

RATING: 7
A dice-driven game where players are attempting to get poker hands to win items, which eventually net victory points.  Players each have 5 dice, which have 9, 10, J, K, Q, and Aces on each side.  Players roll the dice, then secretly decide how many to keep/fix (they must keep/fix at least one) before rerolling the rest.  This continues until one player has fixed all of their dice, at which time everyone else gets one more roll.  Players then figure out who won which goodies on the board (varying from victory points to special-power cards), and it all repeats.

The mechanic is neat, but fairly random (it is dice).  However, it seems like there could be some strategy and tactics. I need to play more it to see how much strategy / tactics can be used. 

Fine for a quick filler.

Yet another dice driven Euro with this one invoking a wild west theme. It is good with many locations to allocate dice too. Cash earned from the bank allows players to manipulate how many dice they can keep from each roll and the kicker is that the exact number of rolls in a turn is not known, instead being determined by the players themselves. This element of not knowing is similar to that used in Alea Iacta Est, although the implementation is different.

Every location has its value here and a Sheriff role allows players to bribe in the case of a tie. 

This is not the best of the dice allocation Euros to be sure but it is good enough for my collection and not as taxing or long as say a Kingsburg.

I have to admit that one of the attractions to this game is the NOISE! There is something exhilarating about hearing all those dice rattling in their dice cups and being slammed down onto the tabletop. It feels a little like you are in a rootin' tootin' saloon and slamming your glass down on the bar. It's physically satisfying.

The western theme is really fun and fits with the gameplay which is random and lucky and feels like gambling, there's stealing, and card-play and even some bluffing and negotiation/bribing thrown in. In other words, it is the wild west!

The components including custom poker-inspired dice, dice-cups, gold nuggets, and even the paper money (not sure it's paper it is thick and sturdy and almost like plastic) are all top-notch and make the game just that much better.

A super fun dice chucking game with loads of interesting decisions, and a dash of negotiation. Easy to teach and smooth playing.

There's no strategy, as the result of your dice roll really doesn't matter. Doctor badluck is often powerful enough for you to purposely not trying to get any set. Also, for a seemingly fun game the process of settling the dices seems slow, as you have to wait for others' decision to re-roll. The large presence of 'take that' makes an already fiddly game more random. 

Games with high randomness aren't necessary bad, but they shouldn't take a long time and make you feel that you have control while you don't

This is a fun family level game in my opinion.  I liked the yahtzee mechanisms around building your hand and how every player gets something for their trouble regardless of others who may be luckier on any given turn.  However, the game needs higher player counts than we normally have to get the most of it.  Donated it to the Rob Oren Patreon.

You roll dice to make poker hands that do different things for you. Sounds like it should be fun, but that fun should be had in 20 minutes I think. Not in 45 to 60 minutes.

RATING: 6
entertaining enough luck-fest with a bit of take-that thrown in. not much recourse when the dice don't go your way, especially with the higher player counts, but few modern games manage to evoke just the right note of stud poker quite as well. major complaint is the swinginess of the hidden saloon cards: i'm not sure there should be a (hidden) vp card worth 8 pts in the mix. this is one of those games: great concept and gameplay (bonus points for simultaneity); scoring and determination of winner lacking.

This feels just too long for what it is and it kills it for me. Just endless dice rolling with a healthy dose of chaos. The components are top notch though, wish I liked the gameplay more.

RATING: 3
Basically, you're trying to get the best hand on a set of five poker dice. There is a board where you can collect money, gold, special cards, but they all pale in comparison to what you get for the best hand. So, if you roll poorly, you're getting squat. Once you have squat, you can't really get much. Seems pretty random and easy to get knocked out of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
It has too much of "take that". Because of that, only the last turns really matter (players will always be attacking the leader). That produces tense endgames, but uninteresting gameplay during the first 40 minutes.

It also is quite repetitive. The 2015 and 2016 dice games boom has produced much better games than this one.

It's difficult to envisage many people playing this and not having fun, and that is the game's main strength. As with many dice games, I don't really buy the extended statistical waffle about optimising for a spread of dice rolls (Stone Age supporters, are you reading this?) - Dice Town is still a luck-driven game, whichever way you look at it. Hopefully, everyone will be enjoying themseleves sufficiently that they won't really notice.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (4):[/COLOR]

[i]We've recently had more opportunity to play with 5+ players, so I was looking for a few more games to add to our collection. Unfortunately I completely missed the mark with Dice Town. 

I was extremely disappointed with Dice Town mostly because I didn't realize just how much you'd be stealing from other players. My family and I don't mind direct conflict in games, but losing a game because someone randomly steals an 8 point card it doesn't feel good nor is it the result of clever play. In the end we found Dice Town to be a very random game were you make very few meaningful decisions throughout the game. 

While mechanically very different I can't help compare Dice Town to Cash n' Guns. Both games are light and easy to teach, but Cash n' Guns offers many more memorable and tense moments which all come about because of deliberate player interaction. Cash n' Guns boils down to calling someone's bluff and creating temporary alliances as you try and talk your way out of the line of fire; all of which is quite fun. I didn't find any of that fun and tension in Dice Town, instead it felt like most decisions were made for you and your actions consisted of grabbing gold nuggets, cash or cards to score points and then hope you didn't lose them to a random card pull from an opponent. I know being The Sheriff is supposed to create some cajoling among players, but it never really panned out during our play. 

I understand that a lot of folks enjoy Dice Town, but my family and I found it to be too chaotic for us to enjoy playing.[/i]

This game is a super fun family style game! It has been an immediate hit with friends and family! Great bits and very well balanced play make this game an instant hit with new gamers too! We enjoy it as a 2 player game and it plays even better with 3, 4, or 5 players! The poker element is mild enough for those that do not enjoy that type of game play and at the same time strong enough for those of us that love it!

This is meant to be just a light dice romp type of game, trying to build sets with your poker dice (9 up to Ace). Each turn roll your dice. Everyone rolls simultaneously and then declares how many they'll keep simultaneously. Keep 1 for free, or pay money to keep more if you've rolled a nice set, or pay to re-roll all of them again. Repeat until someone has a set of 5 and all get 1 more roll to finish off. Everyone compares, then cashes in their sets (9's get nuggets worth 1 vp each, 10's get cash worth 1/2 vp each, J's get cards, Q's allow you to steal, K's allow you to take bribes to decide ties, etc). Best overall set gets a VP card (or several). It's kinda fun for a while, but you repeat over and over and each round is much the same as the previous, with the difference being who's doing the stealing this turn and who's getting stolen from. This constant stealing of cards, nuggets, money, anything, makes the game even more of a lottery. It's simply  too long for a filler mechanism, which this is.

Roll your dice and decide which ones to keep, the object is to have the most of one type in order to get a reward and to have the best poker hand. Each roll, you put away at least one dice and thus can see what others are holding onto from roll to roll. If you want to hold more then one dice you simply have to pay. Basically, it is just dice rolling with very little strategy, if any. Sure you can see what others have and try and get the reward you want, but you still have to get the right roll. Also, a player you just rolls a good hand in one shot prevents others from rolling more then one more time. If you like some control or strategy in your games, avoid this one.

Way too long for what it is.  The "steal a card from an opponent" spot is more annoying than fun.  The overall design just feels half baked.  I enjoy interaction in games, but not when it feels contrived and snarky as it does here.

Amazingly fun game.

Roll poker dice and try to build the best hand at the same time as win certain aspects by having the most of any die face.

Collect rewards by having the most of any die face (9, 10, J, Q, K) and use those rewards to manipulate your opponents.

If you manage not to win something this round, you can visit Doc Badluck and lock down some cards so no one can steal them.

This is a great game that my group absolutely loves.

Nothing is better than shaking dice and watching how they land. It's such an intense experience and the play style is deep and exciting for players of all ages.

The simultaneous play style can be a little too much for some people but the mechanics are reminiscent of Yahtzee and five-card poker. So most people won't be too intimidated by it.

In Dice Town, you roll a bunch of poker dice (actually, they're labels 9 through Ace, so maybe they're more like pinochle dice), with some opportunity to reroll them, trying to get the most of certain die faces for the round.  Whoever has the most of each die face will get to take the associated action on that turn.  Some of the actions allow you to get cards worth points, steal other people's cards, gain special abilities, etc.  There was some SAS as you didn't really know what other people are going for, but I didn't mind this too much.  All in all, I thought this was a nice light game.

A very good mid-weight game. Very quick with simultaneous dice rolling. Easy to teach but with some depth. Nice theme and art.

Although I'm sure King of Tokyo appeals to more people the fact that this game has no down time or player elimination means this one wins. 

The times that I would play this game Vegas Showdown just seems to picked instead. It's a tiny bit easier to teach.

I like it better if you get to keep the general store cards but I still like it when you play it properly.

Kicsit póker, kicsit társas.
Talán ez mond el róla a legtöbbet. Igazából kockapóker, mindenkinek van 5 kockája, amiből próbálja a lehető legjobb kombinációt kihozni, vagy a legtöbb figurát, ugyanis a legtöbb kapja a jutalmat, akinek pl. a legtöbb 9-es van, az aranyat kap, akinek a legtöbb 10-es, az pénzt, a Jumboért extra lap jár, a Dámáért "lopási lehetőség", azaz a nyertes húzhat lapot egy másik játékostól, a "királyi többesért" jár a Sherif jelvény, így a továbbiakban ő dönt egyenlőség esetén. A legjobb leosztásért pedig földterület jár.
Eddig 3 és 6 fővel játszottuk, mindkettő élvezetes volt.

8.4 ==> 6.1
Most nagyon nem tetszett, mert egyszerűen nem jöttek a "lapok", de az igazival ellentétben, ahol kiszállással és blöffel túl lehet élni, itt nem.
Másrészt nagy hibának tartom, hogy azokat a pontos lapokat, amiket felhúz az ember (nem az ingatlanos), nem rakhatja le maga elé végérvényesen, hanem a kezében kell tartania, ezzel felkínálva lopásra a többieknek. A másik a lopás mikéntje ami kiverte a biztosítékot nálam, hogy mért nem csak húzhat a lopós ember egyet-kettőt, vagy amennyi dámával nyert, miért nézheti meg őket húzás előtt???
Nem túl fair azzal szemben, akit amúgy is meglopnak...

The games is a pleasurable as Liars Dice. It is sort of a party game with a good deal of chaos but very enjoyable. I have never played without having a good laugh. There is even a bit of strategy to the game; a bit more than in actual Poker.

I have acquired additional Poker dice in order to add players. With more players the game is shorter (fewer turns, not time spent) and the scores are lower but it scaled well as far as actual play is concerned.

Enjoyable.  I rarely think of anything with dice as the central mechanic as more than a filler, but with the expansion, this comes close.  After the dice are rolled, there are some genuinely tough decisions to be made, luck to be pushed, and opponents to annoy.  We use poker chips instead of the horrid paper money, and it actually kind of enhances the experience a little.  Recommended for families, too.

For people who like heavier games, they should stay away. This is a light game with a large luck element. There is some choice involved based on what dice to keep. Otherwise, not much control. However, it is fun depending on the players you are with. With a rowdy crowd playing dirty and revealing eachothers hands, or lying about it, or accepting bribes and then backstabbing it could be fun. Not long, should be about 30 minutes. Unless no one takes land or nuggets, then it could drag past the fun stage into tedious. Good intro game for non gamers.

Fun game.  I play with poker chips in place of the paper money (I found the paper money a little harder to handle).

No deep strategy, but lots of tactics as you maximize your hand in relation to your oponent's hand.  Your 'hands' grow one dice at a time unless you choose to pay $ to keep add'l dice....which both guarantees you a good hand and gives your opponents less rolls for their hands. 

This game is kinda like a cross between Yatzee and a light worker placement (or role selection) game.  But you don't "choose" a role, you earn a role by having the most dice for that role.

There's also a fun mechanic (that kids seem to really enjoy) of trying to pull the 'best' card from your opponents hand....kinda like Settlers of Catan.  The kids love to try to take the "pony" (which is the most valuable card in the game) from their opponent's hand.

Lots of randomness, but still a good time if you're playing with the right set of buck-a-roos.  Enjoy!

A fun beer and pretzels game that has great artwork and theme.  The use of poker dice as a poker hand and area control is really interesting and fun.  Definitely has a poker feel not only with the dice but with the bluffing and push your luck aspects of choosing your dice.  The game swings back and forth a lot so it should not be taken too seriously but overall the game was just fun.

Take a bullet shaped dice cup, add a couple of poker dice and slam it on the table at the same time your opponent does! Bam! That's Dice Town. The different poker hand combinations allow you to do different things in Dice Town such as rob the stagecoach for money, spend time with the painted ladies at the saloon, hunt down outlaws or mine the local stream for gold nuggets.

RATING: 7
Two player Value = Fair. This game greatly benefits with more players. The game needs more players to maintain the tense feeling of poker.

Three player Value = Good. This game greatly benefits with more players. The game needs more players to maintain the tense feeling of poker.


Dice Town is a direct spin-off of Poker Dice. A better description would be that this game is Poker Dice for activated abilities. In my mind, that is a very cool thing.

Each turn players get 3 rolls to build the best poker hand possible to activate the ability they want to use. Each ability triggers on a different poker hand and has a different effect the player can use to score points.

The game is not about making the most powerful poker hand every turn. It is about building the best poker hand to suit your needs each turn. That subtle difference makes for interesting strategies.

Additionally, players must show the dice they wish to keep from turn to turn. This heightens the poker feeling like face-up cards. This adds more tension and makes for fun poker type strategies.

Game play is easy and simple. A pure dice-fest.

But that Poker Dice simplicity makes for a good party game. Great with a group of new or silly fun-loving gamers.

The game certainly feels very pokerish. With all 6 players the game becomes very tense as players often try to activate the same ability and build similar hands.

The theme fits well and helps maintain the poker feeling. The old west saloon environment works well with poker.

The components very nice. I usually do not like paper money in games, but this money is wonderful. The gold nuggets are great too. The artwork is cartoony but good.

The game has few rules so learning the game is fast. and painless.

- Fun

[thing=94471][/thing] is the first expansion for Dice Town.

This expansion adds more of the same to the game.  And that is not a bad thing.

First of all, this allows the game to handle 6 players.

Additionally, it adds secondary mechanics for each player activated ability.  This allows for 2 players to trigger the same ability, but the player with the better poker hand gets to choose which ability to use first.  The second best per hand uses the remaining ability.

This brings in new strategies as players may now be able to activate multiple abilities in a single turn.

While I enjoy the game more with the expansion, it only slightly changes me overall rating for the game.

miserably conceived dice game.  The poker aspect of it really doesn't work since really most of the time your trying to roll 5 of a kinds...  like yahtze.

I found the decisions to be dull.  At several points I wanted to compete for a particular 'hand' and just didn't roll what I needed.   After the first roll, your pretty set on what the odds dictate is the best roll. 

I also found the victory cards to be insulting.  There is at least one card that gives points in the double digits and in our game that card was the equivalent to my best three cards. 

Lame.

Dice Town is a pleasantry at best, though its since been passed up by other casual dice games like King of Tokyo. The way cards change hands constantly is fun on one level, but is also kind of dumb on another. It almost has the feeling of a wheel-of-fortune feel. The cards just end up skating around the table until the game is over, and if you have the big point cards good for you. There's more to it than that, but not a whole lot.

Still, it's a fun game, and it pays off more when the players are willing to cut deals and haggle. Unfortunately the game doesn't push in that direction too hard, but it's still easy to play and a good diversion.

Very thematic dice rolling game. A couple of things (namely the queen's space) make this game rather chaotic, other than the random rolling of dice, but overall it's a very fun game. The custom poker dice are very cool, the artwork is fantastic, and the overall aesthetic is what really makes the game for me. I love theme. Another thing apart from the chaos, that may be a negative point, is it can sometimes go on for a bit too long, but this can be mitigated by starting with less gold pieces. Very good game.

Like one review states, none of the things that are fun about this game are described in the rules. It a 30 min dice chucking exercise in screwing over the others, stealing their cards, lying about what you have, and demanding tributes and bribes as the sheriff. I bought the expansion for the 6th die cup and dice, but think the expansion rules add too much time to the game. 

A lot of the fun here is just the long slow rolling exercise for your hand of cards(dice)...plenty of time to wish for certain results or curse the dice for their intransigence. Rolling dice! woo!

Igazi hangos szerencsejáték. Dobáld a kockákat és a legjobb figurákat (a francia kártya hat felső értékű lapja) választva szerezd meg a legtöbb győzelmi ponot a játék végére. A legtöbb 10-est, bubit, dámát, királyt és ászt dobó különböző győzelmet segítő lehetőséget választhat. És ezen kívül vannak bónuszt érő dobások is. Kockapóker szó szerint.

[2012-05-05]
Másodikra játszva nagyon nem jött be. Igazából az a bajom vele, hogy az óriási szerencsefaktor mellé, hisz kockapókerről beszélünk komolyabb, akár hosszú játékmenetet kapunk. Tehát részemről egy kockajáték legyen teljesen primitív (Einfach tierisch, Zombie dice) vagy legyen érdekesen kiegyensúlyozott (Alea Iacta Est, Burgund), de semmiképp ne e kettő között. A Dice Town pedig sajnos ilyen. Igazából 4-esre kellett volna rontanom, de a szép kivitelére kap egy plusz pontot.

[2013-04-27]
Harmadik játékra csak rontok még egyet a ponton. Két órás játékmenet egyszerűen vicc egy ilyen szintű játéknak, ahol három rablással simán utolsó lehet a nem rosszul játszott játékos is. Szóval fél órában abszolút elmenne de így nevetségesen sok 2 órát arra várni mikor veszik el a legjobb kártyád.

RATING: 3
As random as you'd expect a game with "dice" in the name to be, but made unacceptable by extreme chaos and caprice.  Many of the prizes results are as uninteresting as the title of the game.  

Hmmm... you basically bid on actions with various specific currencies that are more or less randomly chosen.  Augsburg does this better.

This game is filled with choices, but none of them feel like real decisions to me.  The results for everything is just so arbitrary.  If you try to make as successful of a hand you can get, for the most part the dice are going to determine what you will be able to chose (and the amount of money you have). When you win anything it isn't because you are making much of a choice to get it.  If you get the highest hand, you get the cards that are available to you, whether that be three 1 cards or one 5.

Once you actually get anything in this game, so much is stolen that it almost seems silly for all the effort that you put in to get everything.

I understand that the reason that you want Kings to be worth less individually is to balance off the scoring hand that you get from the mayor, but it throws me off a bit when collecting High values (aces especially) isn't really so hot. Game-wise it makes some sense, but thematically, it feels wrong It isn't really much of a balance anyway because if you get four 9s then you are about insured that you will get the high hand and you get the benefit of have low values. 

I may be presumptuous in saying this, but it seems that the only decision in this game is if you want to "shoot the moon" and get no actions.  Going to the Doctor gives you much better results than if you actually spent money to earn something.  You usually get more money than from the bank, gold than what you would mine, steal the best cards from other players and lock them away so others can't take them.  It is almost like everyone should be shooting for this, and if you accidentally win something, it is your consolation prize.  This seems to go against everything that the game is intending to do.

Now with all of this, if it were only 20 to 30 minutes it might even be tolerable, but the game will just go on and on and on, especially with APers.

A dice rolling poker game, sounds great right?  Well it sure was for everyone else I played with but for me the experience was painful.  This game made me so incredibly mad because I simply could not roll anything worthwhile.  I was bludgened by my friends and because of that I feel less compelled to bring it out, I guess I've convinced myself that it is WAY too luck based.  The fact remains that it may not be too luck based, after all you can place your dice where you'd like and you can re-roll...but my beating was so severe that I'm waiting for my skin to toughen up again before I bring it to the table.

Nevertheless, I only played a single game with only 2 players, so maybe this would be fun with more people.

RATING: 5
This is an extremely simple game where everyone has dice with playing card symbols on them instead of numbers (9 through ace) which they roll each turn to form poker hands and take actions based on who out of all the players has the most of certain playing cards in their hand and/or the best poker hand.

Extremely easy to teach and get anyone playing.  It also has some pretty neat mechanics.  For example, you can pay money to keep extra dice each roll (normally you can only keep one so playing straight each player would roll 5 times).  This not only lets you keep dice to make a better hand but accelerates your opponents rolls.  When a player is done rolling every other player only gets one last roll.

All in all though this game took WAY too long for what it is.  A game this light should be done in 30-45 minutes.  My first game of this took 90+ minutes.  If I'm playing a game for almost two hours I want to play something a lot deeper than this.  In the interest of fairness I will say that my one game was with the expansion and the full complement of 6 players.  HOWEVER, the expansion doesn't complicate the game and SHOULDN'T add more playing time.  It simply adds a second option to each action space and allows for 6 instead of 5 players, but all rolls are taken simultaneously and the same number of actions happen each round regardless of player number.

I just can't justify playing a game this long if it isn't going to be a deep and challenging experience.  I have no problem with lucky, simple, easy-to-teach dice rolling games if I can fit them in the cracks between heavier games.

Based on one play i liked it a lot. Simultaneous action keeps the  pace up. Interesting choices - go for cards, steal cards, go for few east VPs or challenge for hard ones. Money very important and best not to give too much away in  dice rolls as it helps others.

RATING: 6.5
Don't let my rating of 6.5 throw you off - this game fills its niche perfectly.  It's a dice game that actually has some strategy (which isn't to say that luck isn't still a big factor), that can be enjoyed by casual gamers who enjoy throwing the bones, and which is almost fast-playing enough to act as a filler for a group of more "serious" gamers.  In fact, just last night (editorial note: it might not be "last night" by the time you're reading this) we played Dice Town with a couple of fairly hardcore gamers and they immediately requested to play it again.  What it is not: a "Liar's Dice" variant.  Don't let the poker dice fool you - this game has very little in common with "Liar's Dice".  The game components are mostly excellent, with a few very annoying exceptions.  There really needs to be more General Store cards (and a larger variety of cards would be nice too), since players just end up cycling through the same small pile, and the text at the top of those cards, indicating when the cards can be played, is so tiny that I thought I was going to have to run upstairs to get my reading glasses.  Also, I think I'll replace those little dollar bills with poker chips.  As for the game balance, we've had some very wide ranges of scores in the games we've played and I think that some strategies might be fairly weak.  For example, focusing on collecting gold is apparently a recipe for getting your ass kicked...  But overall, it's a fun game (if someone doesn't roll five 10s to beat the four aces that you thought was a shoe-in for best hand) that is easily accessible to a wide range of players.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment:  3/5  Total: 6.5/10

RATING: 5
Actually a pretty clever frame story for making a series of poker dice competitions into a game.  Aside from picking which dice to re-roll, mostly your decisions are about which of the other players is your best victim when you win the chance to steal a card or break a tie.

RATING: 6
[Asmodee 2009 edition] {American West; dice-rolling, money; optimal 5p} Dice Town is fun family game from Bruno (yes, I have another Bruno game now).  It's thematic and fun.  It has reasonable game time. Player interaction is not strong enough.  Interaction comes only from the rolling of dice (force other players to have only one additional roll) and from the action cards.  Luck is important in this game, no matter the dice rolls or card draw.  Players still have to decide when to roll, what to keep, how many to keep, etc. There are no particular strategies but hoarding gold nuggets and occasionally capture property card is a good way to go. 

The production quality is high.  The poker dice are sturdy and does enhance game experiences.  The board is pretty.  The illustration is fun. The gold nuggets are vivid.  The dice cups are handy, too.

Kind of a competitive yahtzee, where you're competing against your opponents for various objectives, while seeing everyone's dice as they get picked & re-rolled. Luck plays a huge part, but is controllable by guessing what other players are going for and aiming to avoid them.

Our first play was close: the winner needed the Sheriff's bonus, but if any other player had kept a single King in that last round they would have taken the Sheriff and the victory. A couple of subsequent games weren't as closely contested, and the game's natural chaos & take-thatness started to grate.

RATING: 9
This is a great game! My current favourite. A simple, but strategic game of dice rolling to build a poker hand and win rewards (gold nuggets, $s, land, Pony, Wagon etc). Simple enough to play with Sophie (8yrs old) and her definite favourite game. Enough decisions (some of them tough!) all of them meaningful make for a great family game. Lots of woooping and yehaaas add to the atmosphere. It has a certain 'take that' element that I enjoy in games. Components are fantastic, especially the little $ bills. A definire winner in my eyes!

RATING: 5
Dice Town was a game where it mostly seemed as though some stuff happened and then we scored. It also seemed, somewhat counter intuitively that the Dr Loserville actions (or whatever they're called) were by far and away the best available. Taking gold nuggets from people is a 4 point swing in your favour against all other players - that's almost always better than taking land. Taking money is a 3 point swing and gives you flexibility/removes flexibility from your opponents.

The randomness of the cards (useless vs. 8 point gain!), plus the randomness of the dice, plus the randomness of the take-that made this, ultimately, not very interesting.

One of the more enjoyable light games I have played of late.  Really went over well with my wife, kids, and friends that enjoy the more casual gaming style.

After many plays the game lost its luster.  Too many powerful ways to swing the game with the cards.  Sold.

Típico juego de dados de póquer para echar una partida entretenida sin grandes aspiraciones.

Dice Town is just too much.  On paper, I like the idea of mixing worker placement with poker hands with simultaneously rolled poker dice with paper money with gold nuggets with land cards with a rotating sherriff special power.  But in practice it's just too diffuse.  Also, I didn't realize that I hated hated hated poker dice.  Charming production values, though.

RATING: 6
Unfortunately, 

this one doesn't a hit a sweet spot for me but rather the opposite, even though it's a fair and fun game. why that is? From what gameplay offers it would belong into the category of filler-games. However, for that category it's just too long. So it's tough to find the right crowd for it. It's fun, but the strategical or tactical decisions in this game are pretty meaningless. I don't like thesaloon and its role in the game. It's just too predictable which opponent to steal from. The cards in the general store differ immensely in their worth considering both victory points and their effects on the game itself.

What can I say beer, poker, wild wild west and some friends and this game is always a blast.  If your group enjoys dice chucking with some skill and a poker feel this game is perfect.  Great intro gamer yet you can still feel at home with "The Boys".  This game comes with a tabaco smell without the side effects.  Don't be surprised if Bill the kid shows up when you open this box.

I give this an extra half point due to the laughs this one evokes when playing with my in-laws. I have not yet played this with another group, but I am not sure the game will always be as fun. If it is, I'll bump it up to an 8.

The decisions are genuinely interesting, the rolls genuinely groan-inducing and the interaction genuinely meaningful.

Just a great time if you want to be loud and vengeful.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 2
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 3
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4


Overall - 2.5

RATING: 9
Definitely prefer the revised edition, as the doc bad luck option is more in line with what it should reward. We keep the 3 cards face down and you must choose one.  This makes it more of a crap shoot as to how much help you will receive. In the original rules,  it was often times advantageous to win nothing, thus going to doc bad luck and receiving rewards greater than those who won something. Big improvement with the addition of cards for doc bad luck.

A fun, quick push-your-luck romp that straddles the lines between a filler and light boardgame. I love the western theme and all the dice chucking. There's a fair amount of "take that!" that I don't typically care for, but also ways to mitigate against it.

RATING: 3.5
First Impression:

This game has taken the casual "yanzee" rolling dice mechanic and used it as the prime mechanism to power an entire boardgame with a western theme.

Does it work? Not for me. The dice rolling drags the game for no reason, and luck still plays a great role and seriously hinders players' plans. The game is interesting enough that players want to strategise, but then the dice ruin it all to the point of frustration.

Nice try, but poor results.

This game is precisely what I expected it to be. So I'm let down or disappointed. It's a light, lighthearted dice game! No Yahtzee mechanic here which I love...yes you do set a die/dice but the fact that you have pay for less than 1 or more than 1 makes the game much more than that. Often 'the best' poker hand you can get is not what you need at the time as well. Very cool and fun. 

UPDATE: I've had the chance to really explore this game and I like it a LOT. Upgraded it's rating because this game deserves it.

Certainly the base game is brilliant with 4 or 5 players but bring the expansion in and the 2 player game really shines. Several different options each step makes it nearly impossible for one of the 2 players to ever get to Doc Badluck and that means none of those land claims get "secured" from the queens. Fun stuff.

I hoped for better!!  I had heard a lot of good things about this game. I was very excited when I bought it. It was a easy theme to bring to the table in my family because they love poker. But besides the fact of using terms and hands from poker there is nothing similar. The game stretches on way too long in my opinion for a game that is basically roll and see what happens. Everyone I've played with besides a few didn't like it at all and maybe they are just bringing me down and I just haven't played with the right group yet I don't know. But I don't find myself ever suggesting to play this game anymore.

Each player gets a cup with five poker dice and eight dollars. Each turn a player will put together a poker hand and depending on the roll, take control of various key places in Dice Town that will allow him to perform the corresponding action of the location.

In a turn, all players shake their cup and take out all but one die which is kept apart. They repeat the process with the remaining dice until all five dice are on the table. Players may want to keep more than one die; they pay one dollar for each additional die.

Each player gets a cup with five poker dice and eight dollars. Each turn a player will put together a poker hand and depending on the roll, take control of various key places in Dice Town that will allow him to perform the corresponding action of the location.

In a turn, all players shake their cup and take out all but one die which is kept apart. They repeat the process with the remaining dice until all five dice are on the table. Players may want to keep more than one die; they pay one dollar for each additional die.

Now the locations are checked...

Nines: In the gold mine, the player with the most 9's may take one nugget from the mine for each nine he has thrown.

Tens: In the bank, the player with the most 10's may rob the bank and take all bills there - each two bills represent one victory point at game end.

Jacks: The player who has the most J's goes to the general store and draws as many cards as he had thrown J's, keeping one. These cards may give from one to eight points, or entitle a player to perform the saloon or general store action twice in a row, place a die with a result of a player's choice under the cup without rolling, or steal 4 dollars from another player. There are many more cards of this kind that spice up the game.

Queens: The player with the most Q's in his roll wins the favor of the girls, and takes advantage of their charm to steal from an opponent. He may take as many cards from his opponent as he has thrown Q's, keeping one and giving back the others.

Kings: The player with the most K's becomes the new sheriff; he decides who wins in any ties, but the sheriff can be influenced with nuggets, cards or money.

Aces/Poker hand: In the town hall the player with the best poker hand gets a property claim worth from one to five victory points. Having aces in the best poker hand permits taking additional cards.

Finally, if a player did not win anything during a turn, he might visit Doc Badluck where he can choose any one of the following:
- equip oneself with barbed wire - the player has two property claims that cannot be stolen;
- draw the first card from the general store pile;
- all other players must give the player two dollars;
- an ace will bring a nugget from every other player.

The game ends when there are no more gold nuggets in the mine or when all property claims have been issued. Players count their points: 1 for each nugget, 1 for every two dollars, 5 for whomever is currently sheriff, and each general store and property card for its value.

With five, this is a fantastic family game! For a game of this type, my main concerns are usually that it either takes too long to play (outlasting its welcome) or there isn't any control. But neither of these concerns apply to Dice Town! Like someone said before: This is really a luck management game. Each time after comparing your dice with others, you reconsider your goal for that round. That does not only have to do with assessing your chance to get the best hand in an area, but also the usefulness of getting a certain result. And this usefulness changes each round! I rate the game a 7.5 with five players (who can play quickly), as I cannot see myself ever turning down an opportunity to play it.

Fun! Unanimous thumbs up from my various game groups, though a mishap led to a missing piece of gold. Like Battle Line, there's no reason to try and form low poker hands of your own doing (i.e., you would never "try" for a pair or a run) as higher combinations are easy to come by.

Like For Sale, very egalitarian: Everyone gets something not matter what.

I love Liars Dice. But other than that I can't really think of a dice game I like. I traded To Court the King, felt 'meh' about Stone Age and Kingsburg, and I never feel like playing Roll Through the Ages. So when I unexpectedly ended up with a copy of Dice Town I took it to game day saying, "We have to play this once so I can get it in the Math Trade that starts tomorrow."

Whoa-- how shocked was I when at the end of our game I said, "No way this hits the trade pile. This is the most fun I've ever had with dice!"

Now, it is worth mentioning that one of the gamers I played it with who (like me) wants his games with little luck and deep strategy really disliked this game. So, when I went home I kept trying to figure out why I like Dice Town when: (1) I hate dice games, (2) I hate luck in games (generally) and (3) I almost always dislike "take that"-- which this game has in abundance. On the surface, my liking Dice Town is an enigma in a mystery in a blah blah blah.

Well, I figured it out: you know the old cliche, "Make your own luck." Well, that is what Dice Town gets right. Everyone starts with $8. And a buck buys you a re-roll of whatever dice you haven't set aside. Unhappy with fate? Pay a buck... or two or three. One time I spent $6 to get what I needed. It seemed steep, but I would have paid even more had I needed to. And since you (partially) know what you're fighting for each time and with each roll-- you can see what other people are shooting for with the dice they've put aside-- you really can and do make your own luck.

The quick overview of the game is that (using a six sided die with a nine, ten, jack, queen, king and ace on each side) the player with the most x's, where x's are nines, tens, jacks, queens or kings gets something special. If you just must stop the "take that" of someone stealing one of your cards (the action for the person with the most Queens) simply spend your cash to get the Queens you need. Almost out of money to get this sort of control? Better spend your cash to get 10's-- it is the "ten" winner thaat gets all the cash in the bank. 

Since all this money can convert to VP's at the end of the game, "making your own luck" comes with a price in points. But to me, that is the beauty of the game-- it is not so much, "Jeez, I got another crappy roll, I hate dice games," but rather, "How many VP's am I willing to put at risk to control the "take that"? To control the cash moving around the table? At what point do you cut your losses?

So now I know why I like Dice Town and not really any other dice game... Dice Town isn't a "lucky" dice game but is instead a "risk management" dice game with a lot of control. And while I imagine non-gamers will love this (quick to learn, fun to play) I can roll the bones right along with them and not feel like my time would be better spent getting a root canal, or anything else more meaningful than seeing who lady luck favors tonight. And now the most important point: as vociferously as I just defended the game here, it is still a just a 6.5 or 7 for me...  hey! It's still dice with take that no matter how much risk management they throw in the box :-)

(**And, as a final aside, something that I found funny: I played Dice Town the same weekend I played Carson City. Carson City is supposed to be this deep worker placement game that is getting compared to Caylus. I *hated* Carson City. The dice rolls in it were obnoxious and the whole game came down to a single roll between two players. 2 hours of playing for a dice roll? Downright dumb, imho. Dice Town? Less luck! Yes, I am really arguing, and I think accurately arguing, that Dice Town has more strategy than Carson City.**)

One play.  It's fine, if not great.  There's not much to it.  It's better than the other lighthearted Western-themed games I've played, [gameid=1335] and [gameid=3955].  There's some interesting decisions, such as when you hold your dice, which items to go for, and when you force everybody else to stop rolling, in order to go for best poker hand.  However, the stealing of cards leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and there are some things (like the Sheriff) which are just too weak to be worth anything.  Games are frequently going to be decided late, as cards will get stolen so frequently that there is common gang up on the leader.  The game is lighthearted but deeply flawed.  Not something I need to play again.

One six-player all-newbie game... At least with this scenario, the game was too long and boring. Most likely will be quicker with more experience, but I have no special need to try. The game itself is an "Alea Iacta Est"ish dice game, but has more randomness and small things to notice making it too complex compared to the content itself.

OK, this is a pretty cool little dice game.  I like the way that players build their hands, and how one player can force other players to get stuck with a random roll if he or she is willing to pay the price to force it.  I like the way that players can work toward majorities in certain areas, and how each area on the board gives players a valid way to pursue VPs (though some, admittedly, are worth more than others).  I also like that the game plays quickly, and that there is almost no downtime to it.  In short, and to repeat myself, "this is a pretty cool little dice game."  I think that best sums it up.  It does seem to be ridiculously expensive for the type of game it is, and for what you get, but dice fans should really enjoy it.

2 - [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/tag/6p/user/Vroenis]6 players[/url]. (5 without expansion for those buying).
Teaching: 60 - 90 minutes.
Mastery: 40 - 70 minutes.
Standard box.

Simultaneous player [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/tag/dice_rolls/user/Vroenis]dice rolls[/url] to determine actions.
Initial medium weight to teach (tracking dice rolls, actions, interaction and scoring).
Light weight with mastery.
Medium-high level player interaction.
Medium-high theme application.

This has probably been slightly stronger than Avalon (not by much) to bring introverts out of their shells in our sessions. Some will always be a bit shy, but so many new players have really taken to the hilariously mercenary bribing and extortion that happens in Dice Town.

Fairly easy to teach and learn, and a much more lively game than most. Not one for houses with sleeping babies!

Finally, a game with poker dice that doesn't suck. Light game play that requires some thought. You won't win with bad strategy or decisions, but luck is a significant enough factor that the best player won't win every time. 

Game play is fast, while both the competitive nature of every action and the "take that" elements help keep it exciting. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A light fun dice rolling game, but not based on the Yahtzee model.  More of a competitive poker dice.  Plenty of opportunity to "win" something every turn, so it doesn't get boring.

A light filler.  Fun, but don't look for anything strategic here.

The components are nice. game play is easy and I love dice games so it was a no brainer to buy it. I need to get the expansion to give it more depth. If you like poker and Yahtzee buy this. Plus the western theme is cool.

I'm not always a fan of huge random factors in my games, but Dice Town offsets this somewhat by allowing players to strategize by choosing their rerolls.  This coupled with the great setting, easy-to-learn rules, and relatively short length make it great as an occasional break from heavier games.

RATING: 6
Very popular with my family. The expansion is not essential. I find it lasts a little too long but you can take out some nuggets and property cards to reduce the play time. Played again with expansion, took too long with 5 players. I find the core decisions too random.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a really nice production that's wrapped around a generally solid game. Building the poker hands is fun, and you get some public info each time people select a few dice. I like the element of spending money to improve your rolls and expedite the other players... and then that ends up helping other players through the bank/stagecoach.

Doc Badluck and the various locations ensure everyone gets something. It can end up being a bit of a zero-sum game, where everyone sort of steals from everyone and incrementally improves, but I consider the game to be light enough that the few elements of strategy give you some agency.

The main mechanic of "keep dice, look around, see what to go for next time" doesn't quite work, since players are essentially stuck going for more of what they've already rolled.

And perhaps more than any other game, my rating of Dice Town fluctuates wildly depending on how quickly people are playing.  If games are lasting 45-60 minutes, my rating goes down quite a bit.  The game needs to be kept to 30 minutes or less.

And what's up with the inadequately small dice cups?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
You use poker dice (9, 10, J, Q, K, Ace) to try and claim various offices in Town as well as a final best poker hand for victory point cards. It is a fun little family game with a slight poker theme.

OK, Bruno and Ludo are now my favorite designers.  This game is underrated imo.

I dont have the aversion to randomness that many of you seem to have, but this game is interesting for the choices you make about how to mitigate that randomness.  Beyond that there is a western themed light euro happening that also requires good tactical decisions.

Its not incredibly deep, but the fact that it's head to head means that its as challenging as your friends are smart (and to a lesser degree, lucky.)

The replay value is very high thanks to the dice, and the expansion gives you a few options for how to play.

The art style is comic and the colors are saturated, which makes for nice eye candy.  The board layout is really nice; clean and uncluttered.  My girlfriend and friend both did not like the font and text size on some of the general store cards.

Less objectively, this game is tons of fun.

The best dice-chucker I've played in a long time. Like a big gulp of fun. Great use of poker dice, whatever you get the majority in is the location you benefit from, if you get none, you still get something, awesome. It feels genuinely different and has a few ways to score, although none as powerful as the best poker hand getting the land cards. If you like rolling dice, or cowboys, or good games, this one is it.

I have some mixed feelings about Dice Town. On one hand, I enjoy playing for control of the zones each turn. The downside is that, even with the ability to pay to hold extra dice, some of your game will be driven by luck. Good play will usually remove most of the pitfalls bad luck brings, but sometimes the game felt constrained. I think that Dice Town would play better with 4 players rather than the 5 I tried it with.

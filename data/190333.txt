Very fun game and easy to learn. Played a three player session on beginner with the Sage, Warrior and Rogue. We were victorious but lost half the dungeon. We love the art and it's less punishing than Forbidden island can be, which is a plus with my wife. I thoroughly enjoyed our play through and would recommend if you like FI or Pandemic, co-op games or pixel art. Will be playing again and going solo. Especially with the short setup and playtime, though large play area, this will be in my popular list.

Although accused of being derivative of Forbidden Island, I feel this is most similar to Dead Men Tell No Tales. I like it but probably don't need to own both, and of the two Dead Men Tell No Tales is probably better. Still enjoyable though

#Kickstarter This is the coop that makes you want to go back to the Snes. The strongest and better result yet to translate a Jrpg on console on the Boardgame table.

It falls on lesser count of players, but owns like nothing as soon you fill the roster

Get it! It is fun, tense and exciting! Recomeneded without reserves whatsoever.

This is a light fast paced tile laying dungeon board game. Also suitable for solitaire play. Each player picks up a hero or heroes of his choice. Each one of them has special abilities / attributes which can help up your fellow players on their quest. According to the action points each hero has, tiles are reviled and magic tokens are collected. Then ritual cards come into play placing occultists on tiles. Whenever two occultists are found on the same tile, the tile goes to the void. This can cause trouble because it can either block access to certain dungeon tiles or cut players from the maze without being able to achieve their goal. The objective  of this co-op game is to locate three dark relics, destroy them and then bring the Fire of Eidolon to the exit along with all players. Failure to do so means all players have lost. The rules are very simple and while the clock is ticking tiles are lost into the void complicating matters. The game has plenty of levels: beginer, normal, hard, difficult and nightmare. It comes with 4 scenarios apart from the basic and advanced rules and plenty of characters to choose from. I own the Kickstarter edition and for such a small price you actually get a gem into your board games collection.

Just got my copy from Kickstarter. While it adds a few different optional rules to the mix, the game is basically exactly the same as Forbidden Island, just with a different theme. Once I realized that after reading the rulebook, I am a little disappointed. I think there are some optional rules and some new character skills that make it a little more interesting, but I'm not sure how I feel about spending money on a game that basically steals the exact same gameplay from another game and rebrands it...

Very fun game. When starting it's easy to think "No problem", then you start getting behind with the rituals and rooms start falling into the Void and you think "Problem!" You gotta be moving and thinking of next steps and maximizing moves for the TEAM. A+

I'm a solo player and really appreciate a good solo experience. This one delivers!

The game is solid, the pieces that come in the game are all great quality. Building the game as you go, but having to be VERY strategic to even have a chance beating it on normal is crucial. Very fun as a solo or co-op adventure. You've been playing your RPG for almost 80 hours, you enter the final dungeon: are you ready? Pick this up and enjoy!

"Straightforward exploration co-op which is a bit abstract and garish for my tastes"

What I like:
- Exploring a dungeon of tiles is always cool
- Character special powers seem to allow for some clever play
- There are several variants other variability in the box
- Small box! Yay!

What I don't like: 
- Overcoming challenges feels very abstract and mechanical
- The tiles are garish and busy, obscuring what you need to play the game
- I have minor concerns about how it scales down to 1 or 2 heroes

This was a bit of an impulse buy on Kickstarter, and by the time it arrived, I had fairly modest expectations. It seems to be pretty much what I expected, which is a solid but unexceptional co-op. However, I have only played twice, so I'm willing to give it a few more tries before deciding what I think. My wife seemed to enjoy it, but not love it. 

I would put the weight around 1.8, somewhere in the range of Forbidden Island to Forbidden Desert.

This is an alright game. It basically is Forbidden Island but with a different theme. I enjoyed playing it, but probably would just like to play Forbidden Island. 

The reason for that is that Forbidden Island is a smartly designed game that has been heavily edited and polished. It's sleek and focuses on what it does well and presents the group a great light cooperative. 

This game on the other hand has all the markings of kickstarter largess: tons of optional add ons, numerous characters, promo tiles, etc. There are tons of little add ons you can include in the game but almost all of them are complex, fiddly, and just add on bloat to the game. I was glad we didn't play with any of them and had a pretty good time with it. 

The game also comes with like 8 difficulty levels or something crazy. Overall I found it to be a fine game, but one that would have greatly benefited from some polish.

Really do enjoy this little game. Everyone I play with starts out saying it looks way to easy and by the neat end of the game they see the truth, this is 1 tough little cookie.

Finally played it! With my 4 year old and 2 year old.  They loved it. And wow those little fingers are amazing at picking out eggs.  But their strategy sucked.

Genuinely a game in which I am no match for children. It seems that my fingers aren't as nimble they used to be. The meat of this game is in the joy of seeing kids having a good time.

RATING: 9.5
This is a great game for adults to play with children.  It's fun and easy to understand.  My almost-three year old got the hang of it in no time.  Both of my boys ask to play this a lot and me and my wife are happy to oblige.  Little fingers do have an advantage and my three year old has the knack of being able to rummage through the bowl, knock everything all over the place, pick out the right egg and still leave the egg-alarm upright...now when I try that!

The components are lovely, though perhaps the game is a trifle over-priced for what you get.  Nevertheless, I heartily recommend this and I think that it could even come out at a pizza night with some friends after a few bottles of wine.  It's fun!

RATING: 8
It gets minus points for the price and the box (why the hell is it in a box that big?), but I do believe it's the ONLY game I can play with my littlest kids and not get bored or frustrated with them not understanding what to do on their turn.  My 4yr old is pretty dominant (though I did win my first game today), and that gives some of the points back.  Now to play this with inebriated adults...

+ You have to love a game that adults can play with their kids and everyone can play their best and have a good competitive time; The pieces are very nicely done and give a good impression to new players and non-gamers.
- The lead-up to the ending dig is a little goofy and getting ahead really doesn't mean a whole lot (but that can be good because no one gets left out then).

Played it for the first time(s) with my wife so we could figure it out before we play with our son.  It was amazingly fun even just for 2 adults.  She's really small with petite little fingers and I'm wielding these sausage fingers that struggled at picking up the eggs.  She ended up destroying me, it was awesome.

I can not wait for my son to want to play!  I think any parent with small children will want to pick this up!

Only reason it's not higher is because while it is a great deal of fun, it's still not equal to other games of higher scores, but 8.5 on a children's game is great!

*Edit* I've played this probably about 40 times now and there has not be a single person who disliked it.  Every kid I played with was all over it and parents were asking me where they could buy it!

[Childrens Game]
Very fun game that my 10 and 8 year olds have loved for years. Despite its simplicity it is still a decent game for adults and works very well as a game that adults can play with kids. I'm always amazed that my kids, with their tiny fingers, can dig right into the nest and pull out just what they are looking for. While me, or any other adult with our huge fingers, can barely get away with touching an egg and the pole drops!

This game brings adults and children together on a very similar level so it is enjoyable for both. My 3 year old enjoys this but it only involves her picking the egg out of the bowl and moving the Gulo at the moment. She hasn’t any idea of which egg would be best for her to pick under the circumstances or whether to play safe or go for the next tile, so needs help from us deciding. This is a game she is going to grow into over the next year or so and a very good one at that.

[ESP] Cada jugador es un Gulo que intenta rescatar al bebé Gulo que fue capturado cuando intentaba robar unos huevos. Sin embargo, los Gulos adultos son distraídos por los huevos en el camino. 
En su turno los jugadores deben decidir si dan vuelta o no un nuevo tile. Luego deben anunciar a que color de tile avanzarán, y que huevo de dicho color sacaran del nido. Pero deben tener cuidado de no activar la alarma, pues sino deberán retroceder. Quien logre llegar al último tile y rescatar al bebé será el ganador.

very solid for a kid's game.  simple and quick with something to watch when it's not your turn.  smaller fingers are better if you have the dexterity, so i think that's a nice sort of minor balancing element for adult and children mixed play.

Kids love it. They can understand the rules, and can steal the eggs in ways adult fingers cannot. I've played it with four 4-5 years olds and they love winning - my son was elated to win two games, it was hilarious to watch. I realised he'd never really had the opportunity to 'best' older siblings or adults in his short life, the fact that this game provides him with such an opportunity made it worth the buy alone. He, his cousins and a friend's son were all eager to point out how terrible I was also ... that was almost as good as winning for them ;P

A game that that my sister enjoys.  Guess what she's getting for her birthday?  I have played this with my 8 year old niece and she would probably rate it the same.  She may find this less of a challenge than other games.  I think that this would probably be best played with younger children.

The perfect kid's game. It's amazing how much Gulo Gulo has to offer with so few basic parts. We have found this game to be very easily convertible to any age group from 2 year olds to teenagers and beyond. The basic rules are a great base for creating your own version.This game offers color recognition, tests dexterity, builds patience and a basic understanding of playing games, and so much more! Highest possible recommendation.

Nice components in this game. The way you can quickly catch up when you fall behind is good. Hit and miss with the kids though. My oldest didn't care for it. My youngest likes it (but he likes all games). I was just telling my wife that if I had to do it over again, I probably wouldn't have bought this one. Then I introduced it to our youngest the other day, and she LOVED it! We played 5 games in a row. We would've probably played more, but it was bedtime. Then first thing the next morning, she wanted to play again.

My three-year-old really likes this game and asks to play it often.  Unfortunately, the strategy and patience required for the complete rules are too much for him.  We play a simpler version that takes out the strategy.  Each person just flips the next face-down tile and gets to move to that tile if they can pick the right color egg.  The end tile is the purple one and we play until everyone has finished.

Very good family game from 4 years old and up that involves some basic thinking and dexterity. It is one of the few games that I have played with my kids that I didn't get bored because of the gameplay. The little ones are actually competitive in this one.

15 plays: Central mechanic is a bowl of wooden eggs, with a chopstick sticking upwards in them that wants to fall over. Can you remove a blue, green, red or yellow egg so that the stick doesn't fall?

Egg stealing part of game is wonderful. But traversing board feels a little tacked on. One of my 4 year old's favorites, and a game I enjoy and that is legitimately challenging to me, with my older, larger, clumsier fingers.

Gets asked for incredibly often -- just has a fun, compelling theme that feels mischievous.

The kids have unfortunately lost most of the pieces.  Removing this from collection.

RATING FOR YOUNG KIDS. Great game for the kids.  Gave to my daughter on her 3rd birthday. Everyone who we have played with loves this game. Easy rules for the kids to grasp and they stand a chance to beat the adults thanks to their little fingers.

Rated as a kids game - and my kids just love this one.  Great game for kids and adults to play together - you can try your hardest and they still win a lot of the time - and not just due to chance - there is skill involved - though little, dextrous, fingers are a significanmt advantage.

Good silly fun!  Players pick little wooded eggs out of a wooden bowl, being careful not to trip an alarm in the process.  For each successful pick, you'll advance down a track in a race to the finish.  Fail, and you'll be set back a bit.

Not very interesting for just adults, but fun to play with kids.

While being a kids game, I can't help but think how much fun this would be after everyone's been drinking all night.  What we found to be most challenging is not getting the eggs but putting the stick back in.  Cool idea for a game.

Great Kids Game, that will work with adults too. Not bad as a filler with adults as well.

If anyone who has kids, asks you what game to get that can be played between adults and kids, be fun, allow the kids to have fair advantage over adults. Then simply say "Gulo Gulo"

This is a nice enough game to play with young children -- much better than Candyland, etc.  My youngest started playing at age 2, although he had to be coached a lot ("OK, now try to take a blue egg...").  

They sure used a slick paint on those eggs.  And they sure remind me of peanut M&M's...

RATING: 7
Fab kids dexterity game. Levels the playing field, since kids have smaller and relatively more nimble fingers. Means my 3yo son can actually win a game with me, my wife and our 4yo daughter. That alone makes this game enjoyable for all of us. (Or could be an interesting drinking game for just the adults.)

Found at Barnes & Noble for 50% off.

Good kids game--their wee little fingers actually can give them an advantage.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Gulo Gulo is certainly the kid's game that I find most entertaining, and that's no easy feat. The premise is simple... advance along the colored tiles to race to the end, but the dexterity of plucking the eggs and avoiding the "egg alarm" is the heart of the game. 

With this game now out of print, I'm very glad I didn't plunk down $80 or even $60 to get a copy (I got it through trade instead). Nevertheless, I can see this getting a lot of use with family and our little cousins.

Update: wow... finally got a chance to play this with the young daughter of some good friends of mine, and it was an absolute blast. Their daughter was like a ninja catching flies with chopsticks, while we bumbled about trying to pry eggs from the bowl. I can see why this is such a highly rated kids game and I'm glad I picked this up for that purpose. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A great children's game, the eggs of all different sizes really level the playing field as it seems I have just as much of a chance as my 3-year old as getting the egg out of the nest. I am happy to play this with her any time and she enjoys it as well. Really glad I tracked this one down and will hold onto it for a long time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
We've only played this as 2 adult players, but it makes you feel like a kid.  It plays fast and someone who makes a mistake can catch back up quickly.  The pieces are very nice.  The gulo pawns are extremely cute and come in interesting colors.  This game is just plain fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Pros: Excellent to play with kids, they have a genuine advantage with smaller hands being better able to pick up the eggs. Beautifully made. 
Cons:- Expensive. Would be easily portable except for the 'egg alarm'.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Edit:  Wow -- at first I thought this might not be suitable for my son, but was I ever wrong.  We were saving this for later, when he insisted he wanted to play.  He 'got' the game right away, and almost always wins.  This has currently become my most played game, as he usually wants to play it once a night.

Looks like a great game for my 3 year old to start with.  He likes to play Monsters Menace America with me (or as he calls it "The Dragon Game".  However, all we do is roll dice & play with the monsters.

(Kid's Game) Very cute kid's dexterity game partially designed by good old Wolfgang Kramer. The essential mechanic of the game is movement facilitated by plucking smooth eggs out of a dish which are simultaneously supporting a very top heavy "alarm" pole. Nice in that the size of the eggs naturally favour smaller hands (i.e.: the kids). One of the better kid's games that I've played.

I think I should get this for playing with my kids. The price is ridiculous in Australia ($68) so getting it when I'm in the states ($24) seems like the obvious solution.
I'll try it out with Friendless first to be sure.

After playing Friendless's game I really wonder why this game is raved about. On the pls side and this is a big plus, the kids liked it and dd well at it winning 2 games each to my 0. On the down side there really isn't much to make this stand out as a game. There are cuter games, there are games that promote more thinking from the kids, there are games that they can experience equal success. 
My daughter picked up on the nuances of the game really quickly. Proud geek dad.

This is a great game to play with kids. I got it when my son was 5 and it was a favorite game for us to pull out as a family over Candy Land or other games kids could play.  My son is 7 and we are getting into more complicated and better games so we don't play it as often, but it is still well loved by us all.  Quick, simple, and the playing field is even for adults and kids since kids small fingers have an advantage.

Another game picked up based on recommendations here on the geek.  Our family has had a great time with this one (with the possible exception of my husband who can't seem to steal a vulture egg to save his life!).  My kids and I really enjoy it - especially my 4 year old who is really getting the hang of how to use those tiny fingers to her advantage.  Highly recommended for kids from about 3 (with a little help) on up. A "7" for both me and the kids.

This is an excellent game to play with little kids. Like others have said, smaller fingers are an asset here. There are tactical choices to be made that have consequences, too, which can make it interesting for adults, too. I've docked it a point for the "good faith" rule that you can't purposefully move the eggs you don't actually pull out. I don't like it when there's no way to verify others' honest play, or even your own. How can I be sure I'm not nudging the eggs to make it harder for the next player?

Daughter's birthday present - Nov 2007.  Starting in February 2008 she has been asking for this one non-stop.  Well worth the purchase.

Game definitely is easier for kids than adults.  My fingers feel really, really fat when I play this.  Bought for my three year old daughter.  She is  a tad too young for this game yet, but its stretching her and definitely making her a better game player.

All of the stuff I read about this game indicated it was great to play with kids.  With a 5 year old and a 2 year old, I convinced myself to try it, even though I wasn't that excited about the price tag.  Okay, the price is still a little high for what comes in the box (though the components are beautiful), but what really strikes me about this game is that it actually is great to play against little kids.  We now have 3 plays, and so far the 2 year old has won twice and the 5 year old once.  Mom and Dad keep trying!  It is hilarious watching myself and my wife attempting to grab the right egg color, so carefully, so slowly, and we set the alarm off, while my 2 year old (almost 3) just sticks his fingers in there and grabs what he wants, those tiny, nimble fingers rarely set off the alarm!

I bought this for my kids on the recommendations posted here, and it was a great purchase!  My boys (ages 11 and 8) love to play the game, and their younger cousins love it too... as do all the parents!  In fact I've now got orders for two more as Christmas presents.

I think it's excellent, both from a gameplay and an aesthetic point of view.  I love... that there is no board (the kids decide how it will look every time), that the hungriest player goes first, that the nest, eggs and alarm are wooden and not plastic, and that we can complete a game in about half an hour.

Thoroughly recommended.

Rating based on how much my kids like it.  This is a good dexterity-based kids game.  In fact, I'd guess kids are better than adults in playing this one.  Pick little eggs out of a cup without making a stick fall down. I expect we'll be playing this one for awhile.  Right now, they haven't gotten the hang of when to draw a tile and when to pick the ideal egg.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Fun dexterity game where players are trying to reach the end of a tile path.  The tiles are face down, until revealed.  You choose a tile and must pluck a polished wooden egg from a cup without setting off the "egg alarm" (a knitting needle with a weighted end that topples out of the cup if you mess up).  My three year old constantly demands to play this, and there are some decisions for adults too.  If you a raising a gamer, put this at the top of the shopping list. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Fairly forgiving for a dexterity game-- it's okay if the nest shifts around, as long as the "alarm egg" doesn't hit the table.  The movement mechanism adds a small amount of tactics as well (akin to Cartagena), but it's still just another dexterity game.  Cute wolverine figures, though.

[Kramer/bartender] A bartime activity that my 4-year-old daughter loves. Who is anybody fooling that this is a kiddie game? It is a bowl of bar snacks with a swizzle stick! Flip over a coaster and pull the snack that matches. Otherwise, take a shot and move back!

I agree with all of the many comments about how this is a great bridge between adults and kids.  It's fun.  It's short.  There is a little strategy and the kiddies have an easier time of it grabbing those eggs out.  Something for everyone.  I give it a 6 because I can't see myself playing it with adults very often.  I always rate a game as if adults where playing and will continue to do so until kids games are broken out from the ratings into their own section.

Gulo Gulo is merely a children's game, but the design is ingenious!  The game rewards children with a hysterical advantage of having small fingers - yet it still provides balance with adult planning.  It's amazing to see how effortlessly a child can grab these eggs without the slightest disturbance.  My jaw drops every time I see this, and it makes the game a riot!  Nice components.  The rating here is based on the fact that it's a children's game and I think it's unfair to compare against adult games.  Grade: A

RATING: 9
A simple, colorful dexterity game with the ingenious central mechanism that gives small fingers an advantage. The occasional light choice of whether or not to turn over a new tile is fun, too. Works with pretty much all ages. The more players the merrier. It's silly, fast, and fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great if you have younger kids as their little fingers are a real advantage. The only caveat is the egg-on-a-stick is just begging to be broken; it would have been better if it was made of plastic and not wood.  Probably second favorite kids game, although I think this works better with younger children (3-4).

RATING: 6
I rate children's games according to how excited I am to play with the appropriately aged child.

This is a colorful tile game with really nice components and a very odd game mechanic. 

The story line is surprising--Wolverines (also known as Gulo Gulos) like eggs and while searching for one of their youngsters taken by a lady swamp vulture, stop their search to steal eggs from vulture nests. However, the vultures have armed their nests with an alarm that might go off. So here is introduced the very different game mechanic. It is an end-weighted pole stuck in a nest of wooden eggs in a top-heavy position, so that it might fall when a Gulo Gulo is trying to steal an egg. This is really the only part of the game different from other children's games.

There is some strategy in movement & egg stealing. The artwork & components is very similar to Chicken Cha Cha Cha. Personal gripe: the large box can easily be half the size it is.

Adds variety to children's games I own.

10/28/10  My son asked to play Gulo Gulo. I love that I can try my hardest against him and not win.

2/19/11  Brought my 5-yo boys to their first board game day today. We played Gulo Gulo, Top Trumps Bugs and Forbidden Island.

2/19/11  Highlights: them explaining the Gulo Gulo rules and also why the dung beetle has such a high gross-out value in Top Trumps. IT EATS POOP!

RATING: 6
It's really a game for kids and as that its fun.  I guess other people are incredibly fat fingered, because I find adults' knowledge of gravity to be a much larger advantage than the small fingers of kids.  In that respect it was a bit of a disappointment since I thought it would be a game where I'd more often lose, but overall it's very fun.  You can choose to try and take out the most difficult egg to make it a little more even.

just the best kid's game I know - the theme is fun, the dexterity bit is a challenge, the choices are interesting, and everyone gets to laugh at the person who makes the 'egg alarm' fall.  It's true I wouldn't play this if I didn't have kids, but, I do, and I am very happy that we have this game.

I'm glad I got a second chance to play Gulo Gulo. My overall feeling is that while cute, Gulo Gulo is simply too random. The tile pulls have a lot to do with your success and at the worst times you have very little control over the 'egg alarm'. I think the game has great component appeal and even thematic appeal for younger players. I can see why this one sits well with the older crowd as well (cute, easy to play, some challenge) but I've got enough random games that I don't think I need this one in my collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I quite like it, but it doesn't intrigue me. On the other hand, it is quick enough that the kids don't get bored, and we can play a game before I get too annoyed with them. Even the adults like it. For kids, this game rates a 10 - it's always a hit.

If you play games with 6 year old girls, THIS IS THE GAME YOU NEED.

Excellent children's game requiring more dexterity than strategy.  You don't have to give kids a break here, they'll be better than you at extracting the wooden eggs from the bowl.  A good filler even if you're all "grownups".  There's a bit of setup--not nearly as much as "Hey, That's My Fish!", though--so get things ready in advance if you'll be playing with young folk (or impatient "grownups").

The first game my three year old daughter happily plays all the way through following the rules, even accepting (more or less) if she doesn't win. Little fingers are an advantage, and if you fall behind you can usually catch up in just one move - along with the attractive components that makes it perfect for young kids.

RATING: 7
Great game for parents to play with their kids.  Much has been written about this, but the eggs are very small and children have an easier time picking them up without setting off the "alarm."  This gives the children an advantage in the game over the adults, which is wonderful.  I stink at this game because I have such big hands, but it is a joy to see the children win and have a whole lot of fun in the process.

RATING: 7
Great game to play with young children.  The meeples and the rest of the parts are very nicely done, the idea is fun and it has some challenge for adults so we don't get bored out of our skulls playing this over and over.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The perfect game for many unusual situations (when the neighbor kid comes over, when I need something for a family gettogether with my neices, etc).  Absolutely brilliant how both adults and children can play to the best of their ability and have an equal chance to succeed.  Love it - just plain fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Fantastic kid game for 3rd grade +/- 3 years. Gives advantage for smaller kids. You need a solid place to play. A wiggling table can mess the game up. We play at the kitchen bar. Excellent for spending time with your children, grandchildren, nieces, & nephews. Also, an excellent game for the mentally handicapped.

Yes, it's a great kids game.

No I haven't played it with kids yet.

When I finally get to, I'll revisit this.

For now, I have to admit the rules were a little deeper than I expected.  Game play is still very easy and straight forward however.

I like the catchup mechanic of making the person in front not have any choice in what egg to try for.

Okay game. I got it since I heard it played so well with little kids and my sister loves games like that. She teaches first grade and so we both wanted to try it out.

She loves it! She keeps telling me we need to play it some kids. 

It's kind of boring when played with adults but I can see myself loving it with some of the little guys.

RATING: 7
First few games with other adults were fun, but this is clearly a game aimed at families with younger children and should be judged as such (there is no scope for strategy or tactics and even the dexterity aspect of the game is relatively basic). It is very cute and I'm sure it will be great to play with kids. I bought it for 15 euros which is good value for money.

Our family really likes this one. Always a lot of cheering when someone pulls a really hard to get egg out and a lot of laughing when the youngest easily pulls out what looked like an extremely difficult egg.  Just a really great game to play with kids.  My youngest could play with a little help at three and a half years old.

RATING: 7
I bought this for my two-year-old.  She doesn't understand the concept of winning / losing yet, but she loves to pull the eggs out and move her "bear."  It took a couple of plays, but the ideas of moving forward and backwards and only moving the first space of a given color have now sunk in.  Minus any strategy, she can play it with ease.

We play with the simplified rule where Junior Gulo is always on top at the end, so if you make it to the last space and grab a purple you win.

She's already beaten me.  Tiny little pincher fingers trump giant dad hands.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
Just remarkable. This is a game that three-year-olds understand, enjoy, and want to play--and the adults do too! The gameplay is balanced by their tiny fingers being able to snatch eggs from the teeniest spaces while clumsy parents knock that egg alarm sideways at anything but the easiest grab. Great game.

This is a fun game for playing with kids.  One nice thing is that play is leveled since smaller fingers lead to tripping the alarm less often, creating a more lvel palying field for adults and children.  It is a simple game that I will play with kids, but it will not be played with only a group of adults.

RATING: 7
Definitely a kid's game, but one where kids can beat you with their superior natural abilities (small, nimble fingers) rather than luck. Makes every adult who plays it feel like a fat-fingered oaf. Very nice design. For some reason, my son and his neices and nephews aren't all that taken with it...

UPDATE a FEW YEARS LATER: My son may never have been into this game, but my 3-year-old daughter requests it non-stop! I'm upped my rating from a 6 to a 7. Now that I've played it more, I see more decision points than I did before.

Played a couple of times with my then significant others' nephews. At age 3 and 5, the younger didn't quite have the patience to follow the rules, but would rather play with the "bears" and tiles. The older one quickly got it. Fair enough given the age recommendations I guess. 

Still this looks like it would be great fun with kids a little older, ~5 perhaps. Looking forward to introducing it to other kids in my extended circle.

Juego bastante divertido, donde se forma un gran cachondeo entre los participantes. La pega que le veo es que tirar o no el palito no depende tanto de tu habilidad que de la cantidad de huevos que haya en el cesto.

fantastic kids  and dexterity game.
Be sure to get the few rules right before teaching this to children. My only play is with three young fathers. While there were big laughs about the clumsyness of certain players the game didn't rate to well to them.
I however would gladly play this with children unless they beat me every time.
There is quite a lot of tension in grabbing an egg. And there is some very basic strategy in it as well.

Kids game

The essential mechanic of the game is to try to pull an egg of a particular color and move to a tile of that color on the linear path toward the bowl, and the little stack of tiles hiding the baby Gulo tile. If you set off the alarm, or knock any eggs out of the bowl, your Gulo is sent back to the previous tile of the attempted color. If there's no such tile, then back to the start he goes!

This was one of my daughter's faves when she was 5.  It's fun for the adults, too!  Nice twist:  kids have the physical advantage over adults, given that smaller fingers are better for getting those hard to reach eggs.  
We still play every so often when we have guests.

An excellent, simple board game that can be played with all ages from about four years old on up. Like Candyland, Gulo Gulo deals with colours and turn taking, but also adds a very small choice element, plus a critical dexterity element that children are much better at than adults, especially adult men whith their big chunky fingers.

The basic idea is that your wolverines (gulo gulo is the latin species name for wolverine) are trying to sneak into a nest to get different coloured eggs. Officially they are just stealing them, but adults will realize that they're getting some lunch. The top prize, which gets your gulo bragging rights, is the special purple egg. The eggs aren't just there for the taking, though. While mom and dad are away, they have left an alarm system. If you are careful, you can get an egg without letting the parents know you are there, but if you trip the alarm, they will come in a hurry and chase you off before you can secure your prize. You can only try to snatch the purple egg after you have mastered a few previous challenges (ie. taken eggs of other colours).

The eggs are housed in a bowl in the centre of the table, and they keep a top-heavy stick upright, too. If you cause the stick to touch the table when you try to steal an egg you are punished.

Stealing the eggs lets you make progress on a path of coloured tiles. You may try to take any colour of egg, and if you succeed you move to the next tile in the path of the colour of the egg you stole. The tiles all begin face down, though, an you may also choose to try for an egg of the colour of the next face down tile. If the tile flipped is the next in line of its colour, you move all the way to the front of the line. If you trigger the alarm, you must move back to the last tile of the colour you were aiming for *before* your current position. At the end of the path there is a stack of a few tiles, one of which is the purple tile. You can only flip a stack tile from the position immediately before it, and if you flip the purple tile and succeed and pulling a purple egg from the bowl, you win. If you fail, you move back one tile and the purple tile is flipped face down again (under the rest of the stack if any of it is remaining).

This means that there is some very basic risk-reward if players want to take advantage of it, but it does not dominate play. At best, it is an equalizer to give adults a chance against their nimble-fingered, fearless youngsters. The beauty, though, is that kids can beat their parents at a game of skill, even when their parents (or other adults/authourity figures) are trying their best to win. This seems like the best of all worlds to me, and seems like the ideal formula for a family game.

Gulo Gulo also works as a very light filler for adult groups, too. while it is fluffy, it is not vacuous. The dexterity element is a real test of skill. Coming in at 10-15 minutes, it's a great short game. It's even suitable for playing when drunk (it's not hard to see that the game was developed in a bar, using beer coasters, a swizzle stick and a bowl of mixed nuts) although the extra clumsiness probably means it will take a half hour or so to finish. The tiles are the only components that are vulnerable water damage.

Totally fun. I keep expecting this to frustrate me to no end and thus downgrade this rating, and maybe throw the game off of a cliff. But it hasn't happened yet.

BUT WHAT a truly stupid large box! If we are dextrous enough to handle these tiny eggs, are we not dextrous enough to handle a smaller box? Drop off 1 or 2 ratings points due to the overlarge box.

This is the best game I can think of to play with kids.  The design is brilliant;  a little thought is rewarded, and plucking those eggs adds dramatic tension, especially towards the game's end.

Fun dexterity game suitable for kids and adults together. In fact the kids may do slightly better with their smaller fingers. After several plays they kids really started to love it, and one son in particular who seldom wins is the best at Gulo Gulo. (Rating has hence jumped from an initial 7 to a 9, back down to 8 as replayability is just ok)

It's fun enough to just pour up the eggs and take turns picking one until the stick falls, but as for the rest of the game, I'm afraid to say that I don't get it, and neither do my kids.

RATING: 6.5
I don't usually play many dexterity games, but we got this in anticipation of our baby girl being big enough to play with us. This is an ideal game for the young folk, with bright colours, and indestructibly thick card pieces. As a 2 player game, it's a bit lacking (there's more eggs to go around, so you move up the path quicker and easier, so there's not much challenge), but it has all the suspense of a good dexterity game.

My eldest daughter, who is now old enough to play, enjoys this game, although it doesn't really challenge her as much as I had hoped.

Only one play, but it was a blast for a "kid's game." We did actually play with one child in the gang and the frustration of watching her easily extract the smallest eggs from the deepest reaches of the nest was wonderful. Amongst the adults, we still had a blast, even with this handicap. I'd play it again in a minute.

GuloGulo's components are in Like New condition. The only issue with it is that the bottom edge of the box lid was stepped on by someone who borrowed the game from me and there is about a 3/4" rip on the bottom edge of the lid and a crease that runs to the top. I have taken a couple of pictures showing the damage that I can send if you provide an email address.

3 / 5 - Good

This is a fun dexterity game for kids with a very neat catch-up mechanism that ensures no-one falls too far behind without making the leader feel like they're being penalized. It has the essential kids' game element of being able to explain-as-you-play and I really like the way in which children are presented with a single, slightly strategic choice every turn to either risk flipping a new tile or move to a known quantity - a great introduction to plotting tactics. And of course the dexterity element is a great leveller when playing against adults. However, good as this is, I don't see what makes it the mecca of kids' games that it's sometimes made out to be. There are plenty of other great titles you could play with your offspring.

I found this game in a catalog for a game that my dad bought and immediately liked the look of it.  I asked my mother about it, and she said we owned a copy.  I asked if I could play, so my dad got it out and explained the game.  We played it and I thought it was awesome.  I think it's hysterical when the stick falls out, I love the pieces and I love that we're rescuing a little baby.  I'll ask to play this game multiple times in a row, and I ask to play all the time.

Nice-looking components. Some tactics, but mostly dexterity. Unlike a lot of dexterity games, the limitations on what you're allowed to touch and adjust and how you're allowed to touch it are unambiguous, as is the criterion for knowing if you've failed. Also, unlike in some dexterity games (e.g. Jenga), the game isn't over the first time somebody messes up.

I have heard a lot about this game and finally got a chance to play. Terrific fun! We played with four adults and two children (aged 3 ½ and 2 ¼). The children really have the edge in their little hands are a lot more dexterous in the vital process of egg collection. That said, a former surgeon took the honours in our game - good to see that they really do have steady hands.
I would definitely play this one again and suggest that, with the right set of adults, this would go over well as a party game of filler.

You choose either to turn over the next tile and take that color of egg from the bowl or from a face up tile. If you successfully pick it up, you move forward to the next tile of that color, if not, move back!

Great components and unusual game concept - its like snakes and ladders meets pick up sticks. Unfortunately it feels like it runs too long for what it is, although this can be "fixed" by using less tiles. There doesn't seem to be much player interaction either - choosing which colour to take next is really just down to how easy it is to achieve. My son is not enamoured with this game, probably because he's not overly dextrous. Other familes and their kids who tried this didn't want to play it again, either. Might be good for drunk adults, but Loopin Louie would be better.

My 4 year old loves this game.  Her little fingers give her an incredible advantage over my clumsy fingers.  She is actually better than me at this game.  That makes it more fun for me and for her.

This is my favorite game to play with her.

I've scored this as an adult. I enjoy playing it with my kids, aged 2 and 5. They both really love it. The falling of the egg-alarm always enduces laughter from them, and the elder of the two really gets the game, and wins fairly often.

RATING: 7
Although I'm a little clumsier than I thought I'd be at picking little wooden eggs out of a basket (actually never gave that much thought to that unique skill set before) :)... I find this game to be quite fun. The central mechanism in this game is certainly unique and quite clever. It's a simple game... advance your little Gulo as you pluck and steal colored eggs from the basket while moving back when you set off the alarm for clumsy attempts. Another good game to play with kids... although steady hands and patience probably wins most times vs the slight advantage of small, agile fingers.

RATING: 6
I have yet to play with kids, though that is what I bought the game for, so I expect that this rating may go up.  Regardless, I can see the enormous potential this game has.  The fact that the dexterity element is a natural balance between older and younger players is just fantastic.  On top of that, there are some interesting decisions to be made regarding what color to pull.

The game is simple, and even if you play very well, it is possible that the player behind you can jump ahead without any real effort.  This works well with kids, as no one is ever out of the game.  But it also makes it seem that winning isn't all that related to how well you pull the eggs.  I imagine this would be great for kids, and while adults will enjoy playing it with their kids, I wouldn't play it only with adults.

It's an dexterity game for kids that plays pretty well with adults too although it's in the end more about luck where purple eggs are in the nest when you try to get one of them. One of those games where children get natural handicap by having smaller fingers which makes picking eggs much easier.

[Children's Game] A quick & nice dexterity game. Tricky for adults. Sturdy components, except for the alarm pole thingy. I haven't tested with kids yet, but this will very likely be a big hit.

[b]Rated as a Child's Game[/b]  My high rating of this game is more a reflection of how well it works with children and adults playing together.  Removing the "eggs" from the "nest" is much easier for little people with little hands and fingers.  So, even when I try my best, I have a hard time beating my boys (3 & 5).  They love playing the game.  Of course, the best part is when the "alarm" is triggered.  The fact that this commonly happens during my turn gives the boys great pleasure.

Very entertaining game for kids and Adults who have beaten their head against the wall everytime their child has said "I want to play Candy Land"

Not much for gamers, but the perfect game for a family with little fingers. The one game where our 3 year old can play and beat our 5 year old and parents on merit. It's fun watching him go in with no fear and pluck that baby out of there whilst our big clunky fingers would have created a right royal mess. They really like it. Other than that, we have to go for pure luck games, like Russelbande and the Cat In The Hat game. Not much chop for gamers though ...

Player: 1:halfstar::star::star::star::halfstar:

I can confirm what everyone says about the game: it's fun with children! Adults with enormous fingers will actually be beaten by children. Luck does play a big factor in the game because it's possible that the hardest, rarest, purple eggs can end up on top of the nest after a shuffle. Overall very enjoyable.

One play with 3 and it seemed a bit too easy. Probably better with more as it's more likely you'll make a miss. In this games kids seem to have an advantage over adults as there fingers are smaller and that's easier to grab the eggs.

The best game for children bar none. If you have kids age 3-7 buy it. I have played it close to 100 times and I still enjoy it. It naturally gives kids an advantage so a 3-year-old can legitimately beat an adult while providing enough game that adults will continue to enjoy it.

Only been able to get a couple of games in, but this one seems well done. Holding off on rating until a few more with the kids.

Addended: Having played more I can say that this is a very fun children's game that can also be enjoyed by adults. A slight strategic element laid over a game of dexterity that definitely favors the small and nimble make for a lot of giggles. My son (5) seemed to be avoiding it for a while, but having played and won a few times he now loves it. Good stuff.

Adorable push your luck game. It is a dexterity game so if you don't like those you will probably not like this. There is a bowl of eggs and when you reveal a tile you have to pull that egg from the bowl. If you knock over the center stick you have to move backwards to the last time the color was flipped from your location. It is very simple and amazingly cute. If the box was 75% smaller I would own it. For now I would just stand to play someone else's copy. Definitely would play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I really enjoy this dexterity game, more so than Bamboleo, as GG has a visual race element to increase tension. The variable colour sequence of the path and the variable "lay"out of the eggs in the nest makes evaluation fresh each time, increasing replay. Choices in GG are quicker, with some speculative thought to risk turning over a coloured tile, hoping it doesn't mean trying to tease out a ill-placed egg(i.e.underneath all the others). So there's plenty of sitcom such as: setting off the "alarm" will force you to go backwards; other player(s) may get easier picks or play to sabotage the nest. And it is easier to reset the nest, rather than the time-consuming balancing of the plate in Bamboleo. Good fun with players with the right mindset.

The best game for small children (as young as 2 or 3) that you'll still enjoy playing yourself. And the kids have just as good as chance at winning as you do since their little fingers seem to be able to pull eggs out of that bowl so much easier. For the smallest kids, make the decision of whether to flip a tile for them, and just let them get the right color egg - they'll still love it.

Another game that is playable with very young kids that does not make this adult want to thrust an ice pick into the base of his own skull (unlike 99% of pre-school friendly games).

Kids LOVE it. Simple as that. Put eggs in bowl. Lay out tiles. Start game. OK, so you have to choose your color and that's always good for a 10 to 15 minute argument in my house but other than that, this one hits the table a lot and as with The Adventurers, lots of whooping, hollering and yelling... all signs the game is a winner.

What Zicke Zacke Hühnerkacke is for memory games, Gulo Gulo is for dexterity games.  Rules are simple enough for children to enjoy, but enough game to make a nice filler for adults.  Great game for parents and kids to play together.

Picked up for the kids' 4th birthday.  Haven't played yet.

And, played now. It's fun!  The kids liked it too, although they had no interest in the strategy.  They just want to flip a tile and fish out an egg.  Sometimes it's better not to flip a tile, so you can choose what color you want to go for.  Also, if I read the rules correctly, you are allowed to draw a new tile, even when it can't possibly help you -- seems a little strange, but I guess easier for kids to understand.  

Anyway, it's a good game.  I expect I'll be playing it a lot in the next few months.

Kids game.  The only strategy in this game is whether or not to flip over the next tile or choose an already flipped over color.  The dexterity aspect is not as tense as I would have liked it to be.

I'm in the mood for this if there are kids around with little 3yo fingers that swipe those little green eggs out of there easy as pie. I'd like to think that my big clumsy fingers are compensated by my knowledge of basic physics, but boy, why is it the kids just seem to be able to pluck those little eggs out without disturbing a thing while I'm... well, a clumsy oaf in comparison? It's fun because the kids are having fun, and they always seem to want to play another round. Recommended child friendly in our household.

RATING: 7
Bought this for my nephew (4). He caught on to it, for the most part, and proceeded to beat five adults 4 times in a row. He could pluck the eggs from the nest without a seconds thought and only tripped the alarm once. The old folks, on the other hand, took their time, and hovered around the nest trying to discover the perfect angle. Simple but difficult for the fat fingered amongst us. Can you take the pebble from my hand, grasshopper? I already have, master.  

Note: The game seems to be most enjoyable when played with one child and more than one adult. This gives you someone of equal ability against whom to compete. With just my nephew and I playing, I rate this a 6 - there's just not enough going on to really hold my interest. Also, playing the game as one adult against more than one child is ... odd. It's almost as if they're patronizing you. Seriously. It's an inverse relation to what it usually feels like when two adults play a children's game against a kid: the game is entirely too easy for them but they play anyway to make the little one happy. It's hard to imagine how they can enjoy themselves but it appears they do. Very strange. 

Also, the box is *way* over-sized. About four times too big. This is a game that could fit in your pocket and probably should - that way it'd be easy to take along with you should the need arise. Hey, you never know...

Quality components make this game irresistable to kids and for that it gets a 7. The game itself is simple and not too engaging so not recommended for adults. However, there is some advantage in having small fingers so adults do have a handicap which makes playing with kids competitively possible. One of the few that can be played with 4 year olds without holding back your ability.

RATING: 6.5
Well produced kids’ dexterity game. Player are racing (often pushing their luck) along a track to the end. To progress, they must successfully use one hand to pull out an egg of their matching tile colour, from a bowl. If, while doing so,  a stick embedded in the bowl, falls out, they get bumped back. First player to the end and who grabs the purple egg wins. Fun, silly. Overpriced.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Excellent little game.  The path is made of colored hexes revealed as you progress.  To move to a hex, you try to extract an egg of that color from a little bowl ("nest") with a weighted stick stuck in it, without the stick falling out.  The tactics are pretty simple and young children have a noticible advantage due to the size of their fingers.

[BGCOLOR=#FFFF00][COLOR=#000000]Family.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Kids, Dexterity. Simple game that adults can enjoy while playing with kids. As mentioned by others, kids' small fingers are at an advantage here; it's crazy funny how easily my 4yo son can snatch some of the smaller eggs out of the nest without even nudging the alarm pole, but that thing jiggles every time I go for an egg.

I will almost always play it if asked, and have a good time doing so. Gulo Gulo is probably the best "children's game" I have ever played. It's surprisingly fun for adults who play as well. I confess, however, that much of the fun results from enthusiastic games with the kiddies. I would never want to play this with adults when other games are available.

CHILDREN'S RATING: 9.5

If my daughter were stuck at age four forever, I do not think this game would ever lose its appeal to her - hence the 9.5 rating. This game incorporates dexterity in a way that is rather fun, and there is just the right amount of tactical decision-making for a 4-6 year old. The components are also gorgeous. I concur with the positive comments left by others as well - if you are playing games with children, don't miss this game.

One of the best games in the world for 4 year olds, as hoards of BGGers agree. 

We too love this game, and have bought a Schleich vulture to guard the nest. The house kid is 6 and still enjoys Gulo Gulo after two years of playing, and particularily loves that he's still unbeatable at stealing eggs. He still likes to shout "Egg alarm!" when we adults fail at it.

I had rated this a 9, i.e. -1 point because of the high price and the ridiculously big empty box, grrr. But my heart would not let me. This is a fabulous game, and it deserves a 10. Despite the high price, I have bought extra copies that I stumbled across (yay!) to give as gifts to 4yos. Spread the joy!

This original edition is FAR SUPERIOR to the 2015 Pharaoh retheme, which is too hard for 4yos. For older kids, it's great, but not 4yos.

OK, for a "Kid's Game", this is pretty entertaining!  There is a little bit of strategy, trying to figure out if you should pull a new tile or go for a color on the board already.  And getting a proper steal on a tough egg can be kind of a little mini-rush.

It's fun, but this kid's game has a reputation that exceeds its play. It is maybe a little more enjoyable than you common every day garden variety dexterity game like Jenga. EDIT: Now that my daughter plays this for real, I can see more of the appeal. It's goofy, kids are on equal footing (if not at an advantage), there is a ginormous catch-up mechanic, and it's cute. CooCoo is still my favorite kids dexterity game because it's so damn unstable and the rocking of the clown causes my daughter to go into hysterics, but this is a very good kids game.

RATING: 8
Fun, quick, light dexterity game for all ages. It can be really funny to watch someone try and get the right egg out of that bowl and then blow it at the last second. It's also pretty funny to see someone get an egg that everyone was sure was going to set off the alarm. Not deep, but great fun with the right people. This was a big hit at one of the family board game nights I held at my library.

Wow, that's mean! 

It's a light dexterity game where you advance forward on the track, to the next x-colored space, by picking an x-colored egg (you choose x) from the basket -- this egg is set aside for now. There's a stick with a weight in the basket; if the stick falls (and the weight hits the table), you must move backwards to the closest space of x-color, return all picked eggs to the basket, and replace the stick in any position in the basket. The first player to advance to the end of the track, through all the final face down spaces, and finally grab the single purple egg wins.

That doesn't sound mean, but it can be: when the stick falls, one can deliberately replace it in such a way as to make the next player's egg-picking difficult. Even if the next player is not in the lead. Even if they're, in fact, in last place. Why would you do that? I don't know, but they did it to me :cry: ! 

Not a bad game, especially if you don't have sausage fingers; but I prefer flicking or stacking dexterity games to this one.

[serveral plays]  I am rating this based on how well it went with my kids and myself.  It is a fun game to watch the kids play.  My daughter age 4 really liked the game right from the start and is good at it.  She would probably give it about a nine.  My son age 7 wishes we would have got Monster Menace America instead of this game, but he tolerates it okay, probably he would give it a 6 or 7.  For adults that game is a bit simple and uninteresting with the exception of just watching how the kids do.  Probably about a 4 or 5 rating from me.  So average for the family is about a 7 for the family. [update] The more my family has played this game the more we are bored with it.  The novelty does wear off and kids can easily outgrow the limited nature of it.  My kids now 6 and 8 are about past the attraction this game has.

[Zoch 2003 edition] {Animal, kid; dexterity; optimal 4p} Gulo Gulo is a pure dexterity game. It's fast-paced and easy to understand. It is a very nice children game. The children are having fun and have no problems in understanding/mastering/playing the game.

The bits are hilarious, pretty and durable, which are very attractive to children and adults.

RATING: 8.5
It's the best kids game that I've played. It allows for some decision making (should I flip the next tile, or go for a color already shown), has a great catch-up mechanism (select the farthest color from where you are), and actually provides kids with an advantage (small fingers=good).

My rating is based on playing with children. If I were to rate it on an all-adults game, it would be much lower... unless alcohol were involved.

One of the best games to play with kids,  in fact I think perhaps the best.  The various elements of dexerity versus intelligent choices combine to balance the game between kids and adults.

Fantastic children's game. It has it all: looks great and has nice wooden components, fun both for the kids and adults, some (relatively) meaningful decisions, a subtle catch-up mechanism, it needs some dexterity and yet the little ones will be naturally favored with their small fingers. My daughter loves it, and so do we.

Played 3+ times.  Pretty neat dexterity game for playing with kids.  It's fun to pull the eggs from the basket.  I think it lasts a little too long at about 25 minutes.  I think I may remove 2 or 3 tiles at random next time, to prevent people from counting what's left and shorten the game just a tad.  Good dexterity filler.  2006/11/26

This is my favorite game, (Well this and Pitchcar) to play with my daughter.  Kids can definitely play this game competitively.

Update: Of course, the original comment (above) was written when my daughters were 3 and 7, now that they are 8 and 12, we don't play this one so much anymore.  It's still a great game though.

Aah, Gulo Gulo.  I don't have children, and have never played this with children (although, as many other ratings point out, it is a wonderful game for children and adults to play together).  Despite that, I own the game, and take it out now and then when I feel it would fit the mood of the people I have over - and when I judge correctly, it is always a hit.  This is certainly not a brain burner, nor a game to play for hours, but a few rounds I have found always lighten everyone's mood, regardless of how they felt before it started.  And if that is all it [i]ever[/i] does, then I still declare myself happy with the purchase.

RATING: 5
Light little dexterity/children's game. Small children have a huge dexterity advantage that is only mitigated by the fact that they likely won't play this with any kind of strategy when they take an egg. A good family game if you have small kidos.

Very good game for adults and kids. Kids' little fingers give them a little advantage over adults' fat fingers, but the strategy sometimes eludes their little minds. Kids always want to flip over the next tile. Definitely the most balanced game I've played been adults and 3-5 year olds. The game is a lot of fun for adults and kids alike.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The unique components--a bowl of slippery eggs spiked with a weighted pole ready to fall at any moment--make Gulo Gulo a children's dexterity game that puts adults at a distinct disadvantage.  Big fingers have a hard time plucking the right egg at the right time.  That makes Gulo Gulo one of the few truly intergenerational dexterity games.

Any game that gives me more time with my preschool daughter is good.  It becomes great if we both enjoy it.  It becomes outstanding it I cannot beat her at it most nights.  UPDATE--Almost changed this to a 10 as last night, I played with my wife, and it was at least as fun as playing with my daughter.  And I could play this anytime, anywhere, with anybody.  What a tremendous game.  But a 10 rating seems so...lofty.

I got this out to play with my 2.5 year old first morning after receiving it from a friend.  She asked to play it again and again.

I enjoy this more than any of her other games.  But we'll see how often she requests it from the shelf with other games.

EDIT: (almost 3) Still fun, child enjoys it, and asks for it about equally to others.  The best thing about this game is that I don't need to intentionally throw the game to make it interesting for my daughter.  Unlike other reviews I've read, this is not because I have a terribly difficult time getting out eggs, but because the little one doesn't have a difficult time either.  While ultimately this is little more than a roll-and-move game, pulling eggs out of a cup is much more interesting than rolling a die.

Update: (3+ years) my daughter likes this game more as she's getting older.  I still like it well (never turn down a game because I don't want to play it).  So it gets a slight rating boost.

Gulo Gulo was the best children’s game I played at BGG.CON, which is particularly impressive given my exceedingly high expectations for it. Gulo Gulo is probably the most recommended children’s game on BoardGameGeek when someone asks for recommendations, so I had high hopes. It didn’t quite live up to those, but was certainly fun and I could see the appeal, so it’s one I hope to eventually purchase. It’s a neat little dexterity game where players are attempting to carefully remove wooden eggs from a bowl without triggering the "egg alarm" (i.e., a wobbly stick that is tenuously standing in the bowl). The neat mechanic is that players can decide which color egg to try to remove, which allows them to move to the next colored space on the track that’s the same color as the egg they removed. This is along the same lines as Candyland, except instead of randomly drawing a color, you get to pick the color based on how risk averse or risk preferring you’d like to be given the current state of the bowl of eggs. It’s really a beautiful children’s game that is extremely simple yet provides the opportunity for meaningful decisions.

Another winning kids game, especially for leveling the playing field -- and not just between the kids and adults, but between my 7 and 5 year olds! Sam's smaller hands give him a clear advantage here. Also, Max's insistence that no egg is too difficult to grab is a good lesson in humility for him.

RATING: 7
This is a good one for kids. My kids aren't old enough to get all the rules yet, but they like pulling eggs from the nest with their tiny fingers. When played by adults only, the game is somewhat entertaining as you watch your big goofball fingers dip in to nab eggs. I probably won't regularly choose this game unless kids are involved. In my opinion, it hasn't lived up to the hype....yet.

Apart from the cute and high quality components, the game itself is very good. Light tactics. The leaning and almost-fall stick is the source of tension and laughters. 
There is a point noteworthy. This is one of rare games (especially in the dexterity genre) that a young kid is definitely able to compete with or win over adults. Flix Mix is another example.

RATING: 7.5
Children's dexterity game with an excellent ranking on BGG for what it is. Each player advances his "Gulo", a wolverine, along colored tiles - to advance, the player must select one of the upcoming colors or take a chance and randomly draw a new colored tile; then, using his hand, the player must pick an egg of the matching color out of the nest without tripping the alarm. Combines a decent amount of choice for a kid's game with the dexterity element evening the playing field when adults are in the mix. Attractive components help bring the kids in as well.

Rated after 29 games, quite nice and quick dexterity game, which is easy to learn. The theme is quite abstract, but at least there is some kind of theme. :) Not much of a content there, nor different strategies, but enjoyable game with couple of beers. The fluff is just hilarious, at least in Finnish after a couple of beers.

Dexterity game, where you need to pay some attention to the choices you are presented. Luck is of course included, but this is more for casual gamers and young ones.

Updated after the latest play, upgraded the rating from 6 to 7.

It is a children's game, but works nicely with non-gamers especially for relaxed situations.

This game is obviously made for little kids, so don't even attempt to bring it to game night unless you are sure everyone is going to be really wasted, since it more or less is just a way too easy dexterity game. I will say it absolutely shines as a game for adults to play with pre-schoolers though. It's one of the few games that I can honestly say little kids have a huge advantage over the grown-ups. My daughters nimble little four-year-old fingers can literally grab any egg she wants in two seconds, while my wife and I can barely even grip the eggs sitting on top and fully exposed.

Little kids LOVE beating Mom and Dad at the game table, especially if they see you gaming all the time. Honestly, I kind of like it when they beat me as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This rating is actually as a party game for adults (haven't had a chance to try it with actual children yet, but I'm optimistic). Much harder than it looks. Loses points for final-stack rules that are a bit arbitrary (perhaps intentionally so, to put a little more luck in the game?) and for being a wee bit more complicated than I'd have expected from a game targeted at young children (I think I read somewhere that this didn't sell well, and that doesn't surprise me). Still, I'm really glad I tracked a copy down, and look forward to losing to my son when he's a little bit older.

The last time we played, he ended up walking away, frustrated as all get-out - he didn't even get one egg out of that blasted nest.  My kids were enjoying themselves too much to be overly concerned with his backing out of the game.

RATING: 9.5
RAISING RATING (from 9 to 9.5): Now that my younger daughter is old enough to play, I'm enjoying this game as much as ever! Tons of staying power.

My favorite game to play with my 3-year-old daughter. If you have kids in the 3..5 range, this game is excellent. Everything is perfect: It has challenge for both adults and children, the children are on even footing (or even a bit of an advantage), there's a great catch-up mechanism that keeps everybody in the game...kids games don't get any better than this!

Rating assumes playing with a youngster (preferably one of my daughters). With other adults it's more like a 6 or 7.

For a children's game this is great. It is even fun for us parents. I guess one reason children love this game is that they have a huge advantage against the grown-ups because their fingers are smaller and the skin of their fingers has more natural moisture. This way they have a much better grip on the eggs.

I'd like to say this rating is based on the fact that it's a kid's game...but it's actually a fun adult game as well.  I look forward to playing more of this...especially when my kids are old enough to join in.

Dexterity game with nice pieces and theme. Great as a children's game, family game or something light for gamers to wind down with.

Silly little child friendly game.  Little fingered children will have an edge on big fingered adults.

Rated as a kids game.

The kids love this one!  3 year old always asks to play the "egg game".  There is little (but some) strategy involved which makes it a great teaching tool.  Kids have the advantage skill-wise so you can play your best against them and still lose often!

My 3 1/2 year old grandson loves this. Given his age, sitting through 2 whole games is pretty good. I enjoy it as well. 

Well, he's now 6 and though not a frequent choice, still a fun game for all of us.

Great game with children. Sometimes when I watch a few years old child grab the right egg without dropping the stick, I think that the less you think about what you're doing, the better you'll do.

I'm not sure what to say about a game where you just fish wooden eggs out of a cup.  It was kind of amusing, but I'm not sure it was really a game.  Even for kids, I'd at least want challenge them mentally.

Us 'Geeks spend pages and pages debating the finer points of our favorite design. While I am sure that Gulo Gulo isn't on anybody's top brain burner list and there really isn't much to debate - nothing beats playing this game with your kids, especially the young ones, deftly grab eggs from the bottom of the nest when there are easier ones to reach, all of them cheering mom and dad to trip the alarm, or watching your three year old beam as she pulls out the purple egg (doesn't matter that it was her first turn of the game). Great fun. This is what the hobby is about.

Wonderful manual dexterity game with some decision making -- but really focused on the fabulous bits and the fine coordination to draw those little eggs out of the nest. What a great built-in balancing mechanism for kids to compete on equal terms with adults. Shines as a childrens game and has wonderful components. Benjamin is amazing at this game -- fearlessly digging into the nest and plucking out eggs with zeal. And rarely ever making the bird fall. I feel extremely clumsy next to him!

Great game! A big hit with my 7-year old daughter, and I really must try my hardest to squeeze out a win against her - usually she trounces me. We can even play the game together with our 2-year old daughter, which is great. :)

RATING: N/A
This seems like a really neat "kids" game with some minor strategy, but much greater use of dexterity than many games.  In fact, as small fingers are ideal, many kids will be better at this than many grown-ups.  The only possible problem is that the playing pieces look a lot like M&M's and small children would be at risk of eating the game!

Great children/family's game, one I would not hesistate to recommend to the appropriate audiences.  However, playing this with other adults just seem to lose that magical touch.

An awesome dexterity game which works great as a gateway for non gamers and children. If only the box weren't 12 times too big!

RATING: 7.5
Very cool dexterity game that is as strategic as you'd like it to be, not unlike Verflixxt!  The fact that one of the three-year-olds won the first game - a very close game, I might add - says much about the family compatibility of this game.

Cute components and an original dexterity element make this an excellent game to play with the little ones. Choosing which color to go for in order to move farther (or not) will elude the smaller ones, but it's easy to help them along.

One of the best "kids" games ever! Before we got it, our kids never wanted to play games (watch TV was more fun). But after we got a copy of Gulo Gulo, we play at least three times a week with them!

Saca del posillo un huevo del color de la casilla a la que quieres avanzar. Si activas la alarma (se cael el palito u otro huevo) debes retorceder. Quien logre encontrar al Gulo Gulo Junior y recperar el huevo lila gana.

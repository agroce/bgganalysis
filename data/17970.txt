Hasbro's answer to Memoir 44 was to make miniatures in a collectable form. While this aspect is the least appealing, as a non painter, the finish on the miniatures is good. My first game was a good introduction. The rules are simply and clearly laid out and easy to read. The examples are consistent with the rules, and the game play is intuitive. The card stock is acceptable but well below German game (Carta Mundi) quality. The overall package is very good and I do not expect my rating to change. The cards themselves contain all the necessary information and this means that they can easily be placed near the units on the board. the minitures even contain a name of the item on the reverse side of the base, which you can read in good light. 

The maps are geomorpic and double sided, and when reverse creased flatten down pretty well.

The trading aspect is annoying but a starter and booster will be plenty to play with and at this price the game compares well from a value for money perspective with "standard" boardgames. 

I shall add more to to my set on miniatures and look forward to the expansions that will inevitably follow.

Great minis, but scale-wise on them are bad. Great maps. Game system is a step more than rolling '1s'.

Did not like the need to buy-and-buy, just to have a decent game.

The gameplay is rather basic but does put a new twist to AnA system. The otherwise wrong dice rolling concept to collect certain hits does make the game kind of strange. With the wrong purchase of units, it's possible that you may never be able to harm opposing units.

Not sure why we need miniatures in the first place.

Nice minis wargame at the lighter end of the complexity spectrum. It is nice to have some options in the WWII minis wargame arena. Pretty much the only available choices are Flames of War and this. And if those are the choices then A&A minis are the hands down winner. Much cheaper than FoW and you don't have to paint the minis. 

Compared to something like Memoir '44 I'd say this is the more interesting game without much more in rules learning. The simple rules make the game easy to teach while the specific unit abilities provide a level of tactical game play that gives the player more control over the final outcome of the game. It's nice that the special abilities of each unit also provide some historical feel for each unit as well. 

The minis are pretty nice taken as a whole, some sets are better than others however. The variety of units available is also pretty good and now that the Early War set is coming out (Dec. 2009) the variety of possible nations is also pretty surprising. Not all are playable by themselves but it's nice to have some options available.

As far as the game being collectable. Yeah, it's a pain but it's not the end of the world. You aren't forced to buy boosters. Ebay and the very large singles market are perfectly acceptable alternatives to amassing just the pieces you want. And there are several good sites with great trade boards, this one is the best I've found:

http://aaminis.myfastforum.org/

The major drawback I see to the game is the rules. The 'Advanced Rules' as they call them are the basic rules of the game. But then several years ago they came out with the Expanded Rules. These added a couple things to the game but not everyone liked these rules. Then the inclusion of rule updates further added some confusion and then finally WotC decided to update all the cards for all the sets. Now the problem is that everyone ends up playing a different game. Some just play with the advanced rules, some add the expanded rules, some add some of the expanded rules, some use the updated cards, some use the rule updates and finally there are tons of house rules. It makes any kind of organized play all but impossible. A major overhaul of the rules by WotC would be a big boost for the game but I doubt that will happen anytime soon. 

But in the end there is nothing wrong with getting the units you want, finding some friends to play with, using the rules that will make the game enjoyable to you and just having fun. The game is fairly simple, easy to teach, fun to play and offers plenty of opportunity for tactical and strategic choices to be made by the players that will directly affect the outcome of the game.

I'll add a note about scale and sets. As of May 2011 there are 10 sets of minis. The first 5 are long OOP and are considered v1 minis. The vehicles in these sets had a smaller, non-standard scale than the vehicles in the more recent sets. The soldiers, planes and artillery are the same scale as the more recent sets although artillery is really hit or miss when trying to pin down a specific scale. The soldiers are all 15mm or about 1:100 scale. The planes are about 1:200 scale and are just about the same size as the Wings of War miniatures. The vehicles in the older v1 sets were of no particular scale but the v2 sets were all standardized to 15mm or about 1:100 scale. There are currently 5 v2 sets available. The 39-45 set is now OOP but is still available through online single stores like Miniature Market or CoolStuffInc and a few others. The Counter Offensive set has been released and appears fairly popular with a number of interesting units. The next set (Late War) is lined up to appear in early 2012.

Also, I have not listed all of the expansion boosters and map packs that I own in the database. I just put all this under this one database entry for simplicity. But I do have something from every set and map pack that has been released.

The a&a minis are really nice. The game gives a feeling like things could have gone the way it went. Tanks without infantry support are weak agains enemy infantry etc. The collectable aspect is the only big minus, but fortunately you get enough troops form the starter to start a battle. buying boosters is not mandatory like in magic etc.. You can actually get a working army w a starter + 1 or 2 boosters. The rest is fine-tuning and collecting just to have em..

i got my copy for free, and i am not diametrically opposed to games that are technically collectible.  the starters do seem a bit expensive for what you get compared to something like heroscape.  this game is playable without being a collector.  fairly simple rules.  the character abilities and objective for victory force players to come out of cover and really play the game.  long enough to enjoy, and short enough that it didn't wear out its welcome.  felt like a great skirmish length.  the booster boxes are also perfect for home-made dice towers!  now that several sets have been released, it seems like one could get in really cheaply by picking up common/uncommon sets on ebay.  if this were a boxed game with multiple scenarios i think i'd be more likely to play.

Upgraded after multi playings. What changed?
My friends are converting some ASL scenarios for this thing and suddenly it's a hell of a game. Better tactics will win. No doubt. 
Price is no issue at all as other WW2 miniatures are costly. Cost for the base system with enough variation should be around 125 Euro which is peanuts compared to other money sucking (e.g.Warhammer) miniature battle systems.
It's no ASL, but it has a whole other feeling than Memoir44. Far more tactical.
I read (or better tried to read) the rules of ASL, Up Front, Rapid Fire etc and we were always struggling with the rules. Or better still: the rules always won !
Now this simple game comes along and finally we can play with miniature tanks without discussing the rules.
Hey someone invented a simple miniatures system of WW2 and we can really play with these Tigers and Shermans!
The bad thing:
It's collectable they are planning 4 new expansions over a time period of 12 months. This will kill the game in 2 years time (just like all those other CCG's). 
So sad really, because in creating scenarios we see much potential in this light wargame.
Some tips: use the tiles of Memoir 44 to change the terrein or better still: create a 3D hex-grid terrain.

Actually this game is a 10 and a 4 for me at the same time, which averages out a a 7.0. The 10 is for an amazing variety of pieces and it being a fast-paced game. The 4 is for collectibility ( although this is also fun!) and most importantly for the fact that the rules and unit abilities in some cases defy all logic and are more in tune with a fantasy based theme than with WW 2. For these we have been using houserules for a very long time and with these included it is actually my favourite game. In its short existance the game has gone through many changes: the pieces themselves have been increased in size as well as the maps/ hexes, expanded rules have been issued to address the previously mentioned issue ( and another rules revision is scheduled for July 2008). Frustrating as this may be on the one hand, in all honesty I think all these changes so far have been for the better. Just a shame they didn't get it right from the beginning! With our houserules in play it's actually my second favourite wargame after Eastfront II ( they're not really cpmparable since Eastfront is a strategic game and AAM is a tactical one...)

P&P 9 raffle prize plus ebay goodness. This is at it's heart a very simple WWII skirmish miniatures game. Ebay makes the collectible bit bearable as you can generally find what you want as singles online, even if it is in the US or Hong Kong, which is far cheaper than sourcing from the UK! 

My WWII games now number two. In AAM and ASL this is about as light and as heavy as you could get.

What's not to like? ....other than the enormous cost to collect the Uber-Collection. But hey, what else are you going to spend your money on that is as cool as these pre-painted minis! I really don't like the "mystery package" concept of the way these things are sold, and learned pretty quick to buy them by the case to get a "nearly" complete set. Still, everytime I pass these little beauties by in my game room, I get a great big smile on my face. The game system is very well done, it plays well (including solitaire), and prods one to do a little research on their real life counterparts....that's worth the investment alone!

Crass concept (collectable miniatures), but it is fun to play.  A little more involved, but comparable in level of play/realism (lack thereof ... ) to Battle Cry/Memoir '44.  Some problems with the rules, at this early stage (first day)--it's as if none of the playtesting was done by wargamers and they didn't bother checking concepts common to Battle Cry, another Avalon Hill game, before writing the LOS rules with a HUGE omission.

RATING: 6.75
A good game overall -- though a bit complicated and costly if you want a good variation of units to pick from.  The vehicle models are nice, though you sometimes get one w/ a bent cannon, etc.  The infantry models, however, are too tiny and hard to distinguish.  I think the complexity of the game makes it harder to get back into it if you haven't played in a while, which is a downside.  World War II buffs should find the game interesting, and it would probably be worthwhile for them to pick up a starter set, if nothing else.  My favorite mainstream miniatures game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Rules, while nothing special, work well enough and make for an interesting game to to go with the cool minis. One advantage over some other collectible games is that it's actually more fun to play with common and uncommon pieces, lessening the need to collect all the rares.

I bought 2 starter sets to give a copy of the rules to a pal, to have access to all the maps at once and to get a decent number of casualty counters. I took on board all the comments of previous reviewers here before buying.I was looking for a for a fun simple miniatures game with a fair representation of unit capabilities. So how does it measure up?
On the collectable aspect, yes it could be a ghastly rip off but how you cope with it is up to you. The tanks are quite good and if the common versions are bought from dealers as singles they generally work out at about £1 - £1.50 painted compared to about £4 - £6 (FOW) for unpainted metal/resin. So mostly I will buy A&A tanks. The infantry is OK for heavy weapons so I will get them A&A. Guns I am uncertain - they are fine but crewless - buy some metal crew figures. Plain infantry - 1 figure per squad IS disappointing: I would buy 1 of each example I needed as singles to get the card (stats) - buy the rest metal (old glory FOW) paint and mount on FOW size bases in 4s or 5s. Don't forget these miniatures could also be used to play FOW or even CD (if you have rivet counting grognards among your pals).The maps? OK, if you want a board game feel and don't have much table space - otherwise I would substitute a 100mm per hex measured move or better still use a modular terrain system such as Hexon.
The game? I was looking for a gateway WW2 miniature wargame which I feel I got. I don't have an issue with throwing lots of dice (that many tend to average out). I really like the semi-simultaneous moves and simultaneous fire. The basic distiction between anti-personnel and anti-armour is there (not sure how indirect artillery fire pans out though). Rather disappointed with the lack of decent command and control and morale rules though - although I have some ideas how these could be simply improved which I will post in the forum.)

RATING: 5
It's an interesting idea ruined by the marketing scheme (my rating is at least one point lower because of that). The maps are nice, the mechanics are not simplistic and the price per individual piece is good, except you can't really control what you get unless you buy the starter kit multiple times (such as I did to have two copies of each piece and the ability to have all the maps at once) or spend a lot of time and money on ebay.

(2008-04-12) -- played a game with my son today (who is not quite 8).  We both had fun.  It's actually a decent game -- I just dislike the way it's marketed.  Some of the ratings are a bit suspect, and some of the special abilities are a little over the top, but kids I'm sure would find them cool.

There is a "historical" variant which seems to address much of my concerns over the odd "special abilities" of some units, and in any case allows you to use whatever way you prefer to represent units on the map (your own minuatures or counters from another game), but I have never tried it.

Good looking miniatures despite some problems with the scale.
Totally unbalanced and ridiculously ahistorical when played with the original Hasbro rules. Typical for most collectible games, the rules need a substantial rewrite and the figurines need to be re-costed in order to insure a more balanced game.
Luckily for us, this has been done by the fans : the HHR revised rules are available for free on the net and make for a nice little tactical game with some historical flavor.

RATING: 5
My first (and probably last) attempt in collectible game. Miniatures are really nice but:
- very expensive (not surprising for a collectible)
- finally only vehicules minis are nice (infantry are ugly)
- some good ideas but rules need to be improved
- poor publisher support
- very difficult to built an balanced army out of major nations (US/UK/Germany)
Finally, I consider that this game has completely missed its target: the models and the whole concept attracts mainly the WWII fans BUT it is almost impossible to play historical scenarios due to numbers of differents units required (i.e. numbers of boosters). Most of the time, you can only play fictional skirmishes with fantaisist OOB...
To sum-up: big potential completely spoiled by collectible policy.

Got rid of this lemon. Average at best skirmish game. Butt ugly map and counters. Tons of dice to roll. Why they didn't use a simple 2D6 system is beyond me.

Good game - playing style similar to squad leader or ats without 2kg for monster rules. The good things are nail-bitting dice rolls, wrong decisions, good plans and the solution for simultaneous results which were taken from original axis and allies. But the collection idea kills this game. We will buy additional miniatues and test crossfire now =) In the end, this game is just fun and we play about three times per game evening.

RATING: 6
Simplistic war game featuring more armour than infantry. Was it like that in real life? A "money-pit" game (buy more & more expansion packs). The expansion packs are sealed in the boxes that are all identical, so you don't know what you have brought until you open the box. This means that some pieces are more collectable than others. It also means that it is hard to gather together a meaningful army. As long as there are people out there willing to spend money, the manufacturers will continue to sell.
Also didn't like the combat system (roll loads & loads of dice). Too much luck based for my liking.

For me this system occupies the uncomfortable area halfway between Diskwars and pre-ASL games. It is a fun game unto itself, however I might choose Conflict of Heroes over it if I'm looking for a deeper simulation.

These things look great. Nice level of detail for 15mm minis, and pre-painted to boot. Yet the game itself is lack-lustre. I'm also not thrilled with the randomization, getting several duplicates of supposedly uncommon and rare (but not at all useful) Japanese and Italian units. Might be worth collecting, but there are much better games to play.

12/25/09: Got a start set for myself for Christmas. I'm heavily invested in the naval side, so I don't know if I'll drop a lot of money into this one (hopefully my buddies will!), but figured I'd give it a try. 

*update* - sold - decided that it was going to cost too much to build up a decent sized historical set of armies, especially given how invested I already am in the naval version of the game. Only one money pit at a time, please.

I'd never thought of using Heroscape terrain with this until I saw an illustration on BGG. I bought a ton of it to use with STG LotR TMG. Great idea! I have complete sets of all releases of AAM to date, but only a piece of each. I am interested in the abilities of units against other units rather than playing 'swarm'-type games with piles of Shermans and Panzer IVs. Model quality is variable, but overall this is a fun, light WW2 minis game.

I love this game in spite of myself!  Not the most realistic ruleset in the world but the individual cards and stats do a good job giving players the historical capabilities of different nationalities.  For example the German armor is terrifying and the Japanese armor isn't.

RATING: 5
Collectible 15mm (or thereabouts) WWII minatures game.  Players field 100 point armies of 10-15 miniatures each, and fight for an objective space on a geomorphic mapsheet.  Turn structure is initiative, movement, assault (move again or fire), casualties.  Nice, simple tactical rules implement cover, line of sight, terrain, etc.  Combat is the "buckets of dice, count the hits", with armour and cover affecting the level of damage taken.  Each unit also has some special abilities.  Miniature quality and paintjob seems adequate.  A fun WWII skirmish game that plays very quickly.

The only value here is in the minis, which are very well done, but as a game it is a failure. The majority of minis are pathetic and useless (Yugoslavian Partisan Sniper?). The maps are little more than folded pieces of paper. The quality has not improved. The rules are amateurish and simple if not weak. It is a collectible game, which if you have played Magic would make it sufferable, but it is a poor wargame. Players reconstruct a game with Allies and Axis units. So you have unhistorical Russian tanks with French Resistance Fighters and U.S. snipers fighting Germans and Japanese motars and Italian tanks. What? It is not historical although it attempts to be.

Expensive Random Boosters, very small paper map, extremely simplistic rules.  Basic tanks have ranges greater than the length of the map? Combat can be very random and without advanced rules - very one-sided.  No combined fire, no entrench, no air-support/fighter intercept.. etc. Very poor game design.

PS: I won most of the games played, but it wasn't fun.

RATING: 5
My issues with this game are admittedly based on my preconcieved notions of what I was buying.  As I stood in the stoor and looked at the box I thought "Cool!  Something like Micro-Armour miniatures combat, an accessible sim, awesome!"  Then I got my new boxes home and pulled out a hex map where a tank is the size of a town.  BLEH.  Nothing on the box gives a hint that it's a figurative scale game and not a sim like you would expect from the miniatures on the box.

I already own and love Memoir 44.  There is simply no reason to buy this if you have Memoir, and if you don't I'd recommend buying memoir simply to avoid the collectable aspect and get a game that is just as cool and sports a few more unique gameplay twists.

On the plus side, I really do like the miniatures here, and the production values are top notch IMO.

I lost the game, but I knew I also wanted to have this. I appeals to all the typical guy things I think, but I am still looking for improvements of my armies and I always want to play.

RATING: 6.9
Game play is alright(amended...was playing it wrong see below)...figs are just ok (paint jobs could be better)...typical army points buy so no real scenarios...could buy a real army with the amount you will spend on a collectible game like this...back to Memoir '44 for me...these will probably collect dust. (Amended...they aren't as bad as my initial impression...I still think the paint job is inferior but the game has come along now that they have added scenarios...and I have decypted the rule book...the rules aren't very well written)

End note...what is up with the Crocodile tank?!?!  It is damn near invincible...knocked out a Jagd Panther...a Jagd Panther!!!  It's a tank hunter and it couldn't defeat it!!!  ridiculous!!! (as indicated above, I had to decrypt some of the rules in order to play the game correctly...the Crocodile isn't so tough anymore!)

Although it first appeared to be a dicefest, the truth turned out to be quite different, as there is a good game in here.

Perhaps the units are not perfect and the colors may be off, but it's way better then some of the wargames I have seen in the past (Memoir 44 being the exception, for me).  :)

The collectibility can be annoying, so why not pick one side and trade the other units with another gamer who would prefer the other (side).  It could actually be enjoyable.

BTW, the Tiger I is very expensive to field, so you'd be better off with a less expensive tank.  Too bad there are no Panzer III's in this set.  I look forward to the next three sets!!

Historically accurate it ain't (last time I checked, soldiers were identified by their role, not the rifle they carried), but it does allow people to play a World War II game without painting minis and learning a textbook of rules. the prepainted minis are pretty good, but the soft plastic causes alot of bendy barrels. The four maps included in the starter are alright for the first month of play, but by the time you have a good enough collection of units, you're really wishing Avalon Hill would publish a map pack or something.

Love the game, the mechanics are simple enough to teach someone to play within 15 min but you have so many tactical choices to make.Something between tabletop wargame with minis and boardgame.The first edition maps were not visually good but in the revised edition, they upgraded them. Would be nice for them to release a cardboard version of them though.Minis are of good quality if you consider the scale and that they are pre-painted.

RATING: 5
A collectable minatures tactical wargame that comes packaged in a format that makes no sense from a realism perspective. Why are Russian And Japanese miniatures included in the 'North Africa' set? Other components are mediocre: maps and markers are paper and the rules go down the 'buckets of dice' route.
All of that said, the vehicle miniatures are great and work well with other rule sets such as Tide of Iron. If you don't want to get into the blind booster format, single models can be purchased on Ebay for £1 upwards. Recommended for the miniatures, not for the marketing.

Better than expected.  I had heard plenty of bad things about this game, but it is actually pretty decent for a skirmish game.   Most of the minis are nice, but some have a cheap feel.  The boards are heavily creased paper and require plexi.  Rating based on playing with 100 point armies using just the base set.  While still remaining simplistic the rules are a bit more complex than Memoir.

I was very excited about this release, but the lack of any unifying scale to the miniatures, combined with the lackluster rules, make this one to miss.  I can see this working as an introductory level miniatures wargame, but with the collectible factor making it so expensive, and the disappointing miniatures...   no.
Fortunately, they fixed several of these deficiencies for A&A War at Sea.
While they have fixed the scale problem (to some extent - the regular Sherman tanks are still about 10% smaller than the rest) in the 1939-45 edition, I still buy these only to use the miniatures for other games (Flames of War).

A great game of force-building and tactical maneuver.  clearly not intended to be a simulation, but more of an abstract concept of WWII tactical land warfare.  The miniatures are delightful, in either the original vehicle scale or the revised scale.  There is an endless variety of soldier types.  The game plays swiftly and you can get in several sessions in an evening.  It also scales from squad-sized conflict to dozens of vehicles and soldiers.  Offers a great format for pick-up tournaments.  Too bad WOTC/AH gave up supporting it.  Easy to get specific models on eBay or vendors.  Really a lot of fun without fiddly rules.

Faster game and not as strategic when compared to the original board game.  The miniatures are fun to collect and to use as your enact your damage and movement.  Need space to properly house the game mat, pieces and all cards during play.  Fun to play.  Replay value is less for same day play.  Can take long time to complete game.  Game is not as fun with more than 3 players.  Involves some ability resolution and dice.

Simplistic war themed game that suffers from the "collectability" bugaboo.  Never been a big fan of miniatures games.  I prefer cardboard armies.  Bought one starter kit to get the rules and map boards.  Can't really play this game with just a single starter set per person.  (Unless you are willing to trade nationalities and even then I'm not sure you could conjure up a 100 pt army.)  Got the M3 Lee tank as my rare figure.

RATING: 8
I am revising my earlier "6" rating upward and this is why:

If you look at it as just another game, and compare it with Memoir 44, or Advanced Tobruk System or some other package, you are not taking into account the whole experience.  A&A Minis is not a mediocre game with cool (if overpriced) pieces.  It is a collection of WWII toys that come with rules to play with them.  Even the much-maligned random booster packs serve a purpose: for $15 you get a box of toys, either more of what you have or -- maybe -- something something new and cool.  After a hard day, $15 isn't so high a price for a tiny thrill and pleasant diversion.  And, unlike serious "minatures" that are much more expensive, have to painted and carefully stored, these plastic toys can be thrown into a box and sorted out next time you want to play.

Just like when you were eight.

If anyone is tempted to sneer, please know that I am a "serious wargamer" who owns and enjoys ATS, Panzer Grenadier, and bought the first Squad Leader game when it came out.  I have a fully painted Russian Flames of War army and am working on my Germans and Americans.  A&A Minis gives me something entirely different.  Is a steak dinner better than an ice cream cone?  Not if you want ice cream at the time.  

Do I feel like I'm being victimized by a cynical marketing scheme?  Well, while I don't doubt there is a cynical marketing scheme, I'm a willing victim, at least.  So my summary for A&A Minis is:

"Tanks are cool, toys are fun, and at 15 bucks a pack its still cheaper than meth."

RATING: 10
Prepainted, mostly decent or better locking miniatures with an easy but not simplistic (depends on your frame of reference though) ruleset, that lets strategy be the decisive factor and not luck, which of course still influences the game, as always when dice are utilized. Only downside could be the collectible aspect. But since within the game all (most) Minis have their place this is fine, and in addition makes for a rather low average price per unit, when getting them through booster packs. If you plan on using them for other rulesets and therefore only ned specific units, buying boosters is not for you. But on the singles market they are still cheaper than, say, FoW Minis.

Not as quick as it should be. It´s good for teaching some basic tactical principles, though. To focus on the objective, for one thing. The random distribution is terrible for historical forces.

While I generally avoid collectible games, and I agree there a lot of issues with said games, I do enjoy AAM, primarily due to the fact that I bought everything I needed off of the singles miniatures market.

I should also mention that the switch from V1 to V2 (larger vehicles) scale was annoying, I got into the hobby after V2 already came out, so it didn't really affect me, but I can see how older players would be upset about this.  

I bought mainly V2 vehicles as most of them look better, and I prefer the larger, more realistic, scale.  I did pick up a few V1 vehicles, as some of them were not redone for V2 (which is a damn shame).

I did pick up a few boosters, here and there, but the bulk of my armies I got by buying singles.  I only wanted to collect the big 5 (US, UK, Russia, Germany, Japan), but I did pick up a few Italian units, and others for added variety.

I have very precise units to chose from, with at least one of every unit, with some multiples.  I avoided any "unbalanced \ overpowered" units, or units that I simply did not like (I am not a big fan of heroes, as I find them a bit unrealistic).

I don't play tournaments, only with my close friends, and I added a few house rules to the core system.  With these restrictions the game can be, and is, very fun, hence I gave it a high rating.

However, if I were to actually buy the boosters, play against random opponents \ tournaments, and with vanilla rules, I probably would have given a lower rating.  

It is a bit annoying to have to print out all the revised cards, but with a good colour printer, and sleeves, it's not so bad.  I had a lot of fun adding extra rules based on the HHR system, and my own research.

The collecting can get a bit expensive, as with all collectible games, regardless if you go the singles route, or boosters.  It all depends on what you want, and how much of it.

While some of the models aren't the best looking (or even accurate, as was the case with some units from V1), most of them look really nice, and detailed, especially V2, for the most part.  You also get a great variety of units to chose from.

I love Tide of Iron, and I do technically think it is a better game, AAM does give you the ability to create custom battles, quickly, with the unit point system.  You also get a much more detailed, and varied, unit roster to chose from, not to mention the models are more detailed, and painted.

The fact that the units are painted is also a big factor for me.  Painted units look a lot better than unpainted ones, but I simply don't have the time to paint my toys.  I already have way too many things to paint for Warhammer 40K, so I really don't need any more.

I guess the closest thing to AAM would be Flames of War, although I never really played FoW, but I did consider getting into it.  Problem with FoW is the unit assembly, painting, and the price.  In theory you can spend as much money on AAM, as FoW, however, FoW will usually cost you more.

For a couple of hundred bucks you can have a nice collection for all 5 armies to chose from in AAM.  For the same amount of money you will probably have only one army for FoW.  Not to mention you will still need to buy paints, etc.

The FoW system is more detailed, and more historically accurate, with probably better rules (for the most part), but I think in the end, both systems play in a similar way, and accomplish the same thing, a WW2 simulation.

There is also the factor of terrain.  Terrain is very important in a table top strategy \war game, especially a WW2 one, where theme is very important.  For FoW you will need to spend a ton of money, and \ or time to setup nice looking tables to play on (and storage space).  

AAM comes with nice fold out maps.  They are made of good quality material (maybe not the Expanded Rules ones so much), and look very nice.  You get everything you need in the start set, which is very convenient, and portable.  You can also pimp out your AAM terrain \ maps much like for FoW, if you should chose to.

If you like the WW2 theme, have some money to invest, like simple rules, don't have time to assemble \ paint units, then AAM is for you.

MINIATURAS:
La calidad de las miniaturas es aceptables (si consideramos que son de plÃ¡stico). El hecho de que estÃ©n pre-pintadas las hace ideal para jugar inmediatamente sacÃ¡ndolas de la caja, pero lo malo es que no se pueden personalizar.
MECÃNICA:
Depende de una tirada de gran cantidad de dados para una sola unidad.

Still undecided if I'm going to get in on this one. My distaste for "collectible w/rare chase parts/cards" games is being challenged by the fact that it is A&A (yeah yeah, Hasborg saw people like me a 1000 miles away on this one). Reports are that most pieces can be obtained in a single case purchase, unlike other collectible minis (e.g. horrible rare/case distro on Star Wars minis), so I'm seriously considering it.

Was extremely disappointed. And why is this called a miniatures game? It simply a boardgame (and not a very good one) with nice pieces. The damage-chits are laugable - paper-thin, the maps are a pain to get flat. For a game that lives on its components they should have concentrated on more than just the units.

The total randomness of the units in the boxes also drives me away.
And I so wanted to like this game...

This game being collectible means the gameplay is fundamentally broken.  The process of figuring out what combinations are better is a puzzle not a game.  Sitting by yourself constructing an army is the definition of solitary play (a puzzle).

Beyond that the business model of collectible games is deplorable.  It is a form of gambling targeted towards children.  It adds no benefit to the gameplay is done specifically to milk as much money from people as possible.

Given they're prepainted plastics, the minis are good. Unfortunately, the booster format pretty much guarantees I'll never buy any.

Despite the name, the actual game is a hex-based boardgame rather than a 'proper' miniatures game. I found gameplay somewhat meh: not dire by any means, but nothing to write home about either. The biggest issues I have are the lack of overwatch rules and the presence of certain annoying gimmicky units (eg. Hero of the Soviet Union). The core attack mechanic could be cleaned up too - increasing range means you roll less dice, being 'disrupted' by enemy fire gives you a penalty on the individual die rolls, and targets in cover get a saving throw against damage. Having all penalties work the same way would have been simpler and more elegant.

Finally got around to playing this at a demo and found that I enjoyed it much more than I would have expected.  In general, I don't particularly like gaming with minis, but they can be fun every now and again.  Now, I am kicking around the idea of picking up a few of these in order to play some simple scenarios with friends and family.  At any rate, the system is interesting enough to allow a fair amount of variety, but simple enough to pick up in one sitting.  I certainly could see how  I would have done some things differently if I were to play again, which I hope to be able to do.  [08/11/2007]

They are not potato chips...Just use the online available rules to "try out" the game and then comment on the gameplay.

Well it is easier when they makes so many wrong models/data cards. The poor quality make me appreciate the "not so perfect" models or paintjobs I have now. I already have plenty of good rulesets too. You just need to stifle the greed.

Started collecting these heavily but haven't had a chance to play much (little girl likes small parts), but I stopped collecting when they screwed over the system with the new stuff. The game system is weak, but the Historical Rules are better. Unfortunately, it's too hard to acquire a T-34 as they are all "rare".

RATING: 8
Very nice light wargame. A lot of people dismiss it as a 'dicefest' with lots of luck but its a lot more tactical than many people give it credit for. As someone who rolls HORRIBLY in most games, I still tend to come out on top more often than not in A&AM through good tactics and minimizing risk. There are some very interesting nuances to the gameplay that aren't immediately obvious to novice players.

The collectible aspect is a downer, but the game is very playable without a huge investment.

I despise the collectable nature of this product. As a "game", I find it very poor. You can't get the specific units you need to put together an army without paying collector prices, and the rules were an afterthought. I like the miniatures, and collect it for that reason alone. We've created our own rules.

RATING: N/A
The 'collectible' money-making scheme is a bit played out and not what most wargamers are going for so I suspect the market won't be good for a true grognard to go after this one.  My true rating is a 1, but I gave an extra couple of points for the decent rules and nice website.

I say:  Get rid of the money-sucking 'rarity' collector aspect, and produce a real game where a player can have all pieces for reasonable amounts of money and stop the Magic the Gathering style greedy money-making crap.

RATING: 6
Not a bad game. When I'm in the mood, the simplistic rules do not bother me all that much; but when I'm in the mood for a meatier WWII game, it won't fit the bill. Minis are nicely done, but plan on sinking some bucks into this one if you want to have a decent collection of rares and uncommons.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Sure I wish it wasn't collectable, but the pieces are really cool & the game plays just great. Superior tactics will probably win out, but there's always a chance for the Uber-Roll of the dice for a critcal hit. For guys like me who can't paint well & would rather spend their time playing instead of painting, this is terrific. Can't wait for more units to come out!

On it's surface, it seems like an overly simple combat system, but after actually playing it, the mechanics do interact nicely for some interesting tactical considerations.  Would like and play more if I could afford a more diverse selection of units.  Blind expansion contents is a bummer and I don't have the cash to "gamble" on game components.

Can you really sincerely list "owned" for a collectible game, when you don't have anywhere near the total minis/cards/whatever released?

That said, A&AM is potentially a useful source for minis for other wargaming rules... apart from the collectible aspect, that is.

Fairly simple wargame using minis.  Lots of minis are needed if any sort of historical scenarios are to be played, but it works pretty well with just a reasonably balanced mish-mash of pieces.

Pretty good.  It's not complex, the components look good (yes, even the maps aren't that bad).  Perhaps an inbetween game?  Don't expect a Memoir '44 kind of game, but something much simpler.  As a lover of collectible games I'm already interested, although I wouldn't have minded seeing this one as non-collectible, or at least have different packs for Axis and Allies, or even nationalities.

The great thing about this game is its basic rules. An easy set of rules makes a game playable in under 1-2 hours and it makes house rules more adaptable. A & A miniatures has contributed to many good times with friends (and even my son). We've incorporated several online house rules as well as our own without complicating the game. The only gripes we have are the scale change in the vehicle line and the increase hex size. Why??? It makes absolutely no sense.

RATING: 4
The figures are nice enough, the scale is grossly off, and the markers are incredibly thin. It's a fairly stupid dice-chucking affair, with no real sense of maneuver, no serious use of terrain, and few particularly interesting choices to make. I'm a fan of A&A, which is of course a dicefest, but it's also challenging and difficult, and (IMHO) nails the luck/strategy line. This is a different animal, but here it fails; the variance is too high, and too pivotal.

On the bright side, the unit costs and abilities seem decent, and there's a nice toy factor. Also, it did succeed in inspiring me to get (back) into ASL, for which, on balance, I'm grateful.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.9
I'm hooked on this game.  Go straight to the advanced rules.  The painted minis are a Godsend for us folks that couldn't paint a white picket fence.  The game is very accessible and quick playing.  It fills a niche missing in the CMG products with units that can be used in other WWII games with their own rules.  The CMG aspect may be a downside but for some.  Fast play, simple rules, lots of fun add up to a high rating for me.  It's a dicefest for sure but there's just as much strategy in this game as in many other miniature games.  Given the simplicity of the advanced rules, they seem well thought out.  The minis are 1/120th (15mm) scale.  The trading aspect will appeal to player who only want to build up one nation's units.  

The downsides for me are minimal.  The figures and paintjobs are good, not great, but acceptable.  It's a CMG, c'est la vie, it's a market based economy.  If you want non-collectible, get Flames of War, Battlefront, or WWII Micro Armor miniatures. The set II has provided some nice additions. Set 3 has aircraft. The cost of 1 booster is subjective and gives you 9 figures.

The "collect 'em all" doesn't bother me. I think that the rules are too light, there's no room for strategy nor tactics at all. He who has better miniatures wins, and in equal conditions, the one who has better luck wins. Too many dice = too much luck dependent game.  

Miniatures are fine until you look them at the base. It's difficult to differentiate the infantry miniatures, they look much alike.

Played this a bit and its nice and simple and requires some puzzle solving. There's a nice set of event cards made by some guy which look interesting. The relative rarity of some pieces makes no sense though and its near impossible to put together a realistically proportioned army .. eg. Panzer 4's are not to be found and I only got a Panzer 3 in the base set.

I'm also put off by firing ranges and the scale of the models to the maps. The map artwork seems more suited to much smaller scales and with that in mind I may well buy some more maps.

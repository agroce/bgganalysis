A fun little gem that came out last year. The rule book is toilet paper thin, but that's about the only real criticism I can think of. It scales up well from 2 to 4 players and can be played quickly. The dice rolling makes it a bit more random than I would prefer, but there is still enough strategy here to satisfy those who hate that aspect of it.

This is Ms. Hustles game. I find it is a nicely balance Euro-ish game. The dice rolling adds a little action to the game. The 3D rides add a nice building element to the game.

Feels like an unfinished prototype - everything is so contained -  the theme doesn't come through, and the beautiful artwork is squashed onto ugly dark cardboard structures. The speedy dice-rolling is fun, and there is strategy here, but it doesn't live up to the beautiful box, or the great theme (still waiting for a great theme park game…). Not a disaster, but nothing special here.

I sympathize this game quite a bit. It has superb bits, a refreshing theme, interesting mechanics involving dice and original looks. The only thing I didn't fancy, was the downtime when players were resolving their actions. The downtime wasn't long, by no means, but it felt a bit off pace with the rest of the game (simultaneous dice rolling).

As owners of a fantastic steam park, you're to build gigantic, coal-powered rides to attract as many visitors as you can - but building attractions won't be enough. You'll also need to manage your employees, invest in advertising in order to attract and please the different kinds of guests visiting your park, and, above all, keep the dirt that your park produces under strict control! Steam Park is an easy-to-learn game with two difficulty levels: one for the less experienced gamers and a more strategic one for those who want a more exciting challenge. In this management game, you'll have to build your own amusement park and make it the largest and most profitable in the region. By constructing the three-dimensional, wonderful rides designed by Marie Cardouat, you will see your park grow right before your eyes. Choose your strategy! Build Stands to attract more Visitors, or Toilets to keep the Dirt under control. Whatever decision you take, take it quickly: The less time you spend planning, the more time you'll have to maintain your park. Thanks to a clever, original action-choosing mechanism, winning in Steam Park is as much a matter of being the best as of being the fastest!

One game only (so far) with the basic rules. The first phase of the game concerns dice rolling and instant decision making (which I really hate) which contrasts with the second phase, which call stall due to analysis paralysis. The game is distinctive enough to give another try with the complete rules.

Steam Park is a cute game, a combination of dice rolling, dexterity and worker placement, with speed the key element. To win you have to make fast decision, sometimes even good + fast decision and also to be quick with the hand. There's luck involved but it can be managed in a nice way and the overall feel of the game is that it is nice to win but you won't mind if you don't. I will definitely play it again!

EDIT: Played again a few more times, lots of fun as long as no one plays it as a strategy game

Dies used to cut the tokens really need to be sharpened. Simple game that's broken down into a dice rolling push your luck phase and actions phase that work pretty well. Ride figures are a neat touch. Not a fan of the meeples that don't look at all like robots, the dirt tokens could have been so much better, and the cardboard money tokens are a bit of a pain. Still, a neat little game that's very easy to learn. Unfortunately it wasn't interesting enough to make us want to keep playing it, so we ended up selling this.

Fun game with a lot of strategy as to how you manage your resources and build your park, plus a little bit of a dexterity element. I do wish this was pimped out more, the cardboard stands are great but having tons of plastic steam park rides and robot workers would have been just amazing...that's my only issue, though, that it could be expanded more even in this base game.

A bit of a weird game, this. There's "dexterity", in re-rolling swiftly, but mostly you need to be able to think on your feet before you start rolling, knowing what all you need. The artwork and "back story" from the rulebook are lovely, but also seem somewhat sober; they could've done a lot more with it. Planning the space you need for your rides feels quite unintuitive at first, giving experienced players a bit of an edge. Otherwise it's a lovely and relatively swift playing game, with just a bit of a different take on things, making it stand out from the crowd. Not something I'd have gone out of my way to pick up, but I'm glad that it found a way into my collection.

Lack of dice cups is a big oversight with this game.

The "Casino" stand is overpowered in a 3-player game, in that whoever gets two of them, will have a sizable advantage. We might have to houserule that by limiting the supply to just three casinos. Not a problem with 2 or 4 players.

Enjoyable game, but the icons (to me) aren't very intuitive, which led me down some wrong paths. Lots of luck with drawing visitors, which could undo the best plans. Took slightly long with four players for what it is.

With the published rules this was never going to my favourite game.  Having to play against time to grab the lowest turn order tile is not very satisfying or much fun. After two rounds I managed to get two casinos (allowing a player to change a die on the pig board) so resorted to a single roll and an immediate grab of the lowest turn order token.  From a design perspective the game was well constructed.  The rides were fun, the dirt cost seemed about right, the spacing of rides and stands not over troublesome due to the easy accessibility of the additional ground tiles.  A little randomness with the visitor draw was in keeping with this as a family game and the rule book was amusing.

If I were to play again I would suggest instead of the grab a tile, that there is a start player.  They roll and place some or all of their dice on the pig.  If they put all of the dice on they get the first turn order marker.  If they put some dice aside then they have passed on taking a marker.  The next player in clockwise direction then does the same and so on, with players re-rolling their remaining dice.  If only one player remains they get three opportunities to re-roll as per the basic game.  The start player moves clockwise to the right after each round.  That way there is still an interesting decision but not with the time pressure.

Secondly, it easy to get stuck with useless bonus cards.  It would be more fun to be able to keep both the cards drawn and discard one of the cards from your hand if you wanted.

This game is an absolute blast! First, the spatial aspect of putting your buildings down can be super interesting, and secondly the fast dice rolling mechanic is frantic and great! A must have little game. However, there is one major issue associated with the mechanics. In a four player game the resources go way too fast and, secondly, down time between each player can be pretty bad. I would say three players hits the sweet spot.

Fun fast game.  Good entry level game with some interesting choices.  Great artwork, easy rules, easy to teach.  Multiple paths to victory, point spread in first game 70 gold 4th to 77 points first place.  Bonus cards seemed a little overpowered, but this was mitigated by the draw two pick one mechanic, however, picking one good card at the end may make a swing of 10 points...need more plays to see how this feels, I think we also had a group that heavily played bonus cards so we had to reshuffle the deck which made it possibel to get those high scoring bonus point cards twice.

I like the way the card board is used to create the rides which the robots can then be placed on to show the robots are enjoying the rides. 

It is a shame that this game is only got 2-4 players, would be great if there would be a subsequent expansions to allow for 6-8 players.

I never actually got this to the table. My wife and I hate games with mechanics that rely on direct dexterity competition (as in physically grabbing something before the other person does). I realize it is just one phase of this game but it was like a drop of urine in a glass of water - neither one of us wanted a sip.

this is a really fun game with a stressfactor while dicing. Although the game looks very luck dependent it isn't. There is of course some luck in throwing the dice well and drawing the visitors but with a good strategy you can manage a lot of things. It's a fun game after all, but it is also  challenging enough for the usual player.

This is a fun game. The real time dice rolling component is exciting and forces the players to think fast. The 6 rounds in the game are plenty to build up a nice park. It has a little bit of engine building where you can have add specific stands to your park to manipulate the results of your hastily rolled dice. The hidden agendas are also a fun component.

I love the amusement park theme as it even comes with cardboard standees of roller coasters and rides with good artwork to boot. The main drawback is the game ends up being too fiddly as the special buildings to boost your theme park is hard to memorize or recognize leading to frequent reference to the reference sheet. Basically, it lacks of intuitiveness. Even with repeated plays, I still have to refer to the reference cards and re-read the rules to make sure that I didn't play wrong. For a light strategy game, it has a couple of cool ideas such as pouch planning, real time and balancing your actions but it is also the main reason why this game becomes more complex than it should be.

Fun game that, in my opinion, has devised the perfect way to translate "Roller Coaster Tycoon" into a board game format. Speed-rolling mechanic to begin each round keeps things brisk and exciting, but the planning of what to do with your dice/ bonus cards incorporates an element of strategy into the game. Nice and light family game. Plus, you get to build your own mini theme park. Great fun.

Known as "Racist Racist Robots" in my house, this is a fun game.  Players are all competing amusement park owners trying to build attractions for robots -- robots with very particular tastes, who get very grumpy if you con them into hanging out with other robots of different colors.  Players must also put in the effort to keep their parks clean; there's something perversely awesome about accidentally winding up with a park so utterly disgusting that even inorganic life shuns it.

It has a variety of clever mechanics, most notably the "Yahtzee race" that begins every round with a flurry of dice rolling that will determine what you'll be able to do.  My one complaint about the game is that the random special action cards are a little to important to winning, and that good or bad draws from that deck can give you an unbeatable advantage or an impossible handicap.

Still, it has enough depth to be interesting and moves quickly enough to avoid wearing out its welcome.  Not quite a favorite, but always a welcome presence on my gaming table and one I'm always up to play.

I played this once and added it to my wishlist immediately. This is exactly the type of game that my family will love. The cool pieces and fun theme are awesome, but what really makes the game shine are the mechanisms. It surprised me how this game balanced the fun of speed dice-rolling with the strategy of choosing what order to resolve your actions and how to place your tiles. Throughout the game we discussed all the potential strategies that we saw within the game design, and it was cool to see the kind of depth they were able to attain with such simple mechanisms. An absolute must-have for me!

In Steam Park, players build and expand their very own amusement park, FOR ROBOTS! There are two main parts here; a speed rolling of the die where the faster you are, the more dirt you get to clean for free, and then using your die in that order to either attract customers, build roller coasters, construct kiosks, or clean up your park. After a number of rounds, you get points based on secret objective cards, and what you have built. Fairly simple and thoroughly enjoyable, also about 45 min play-time.

The game says 2-4 players but 2 should be avoided at all cost, as the speed element doesn't have any strategy to it anymore really.

Very nice, cute game. The first thing you are gonna like about it is the quality of the components and the graphics - the game is very attractive and beautiful. You can feel for sure the hand of Marie Cardouat.
However, I think you could feel yourself more like in a fable, in a Dixit story-based fable, not in a theme park full of robots. Basically it's not a problem, you can still enjoy this game a lot.
The downside of the game for my opinion is the simultanious  dice rolling mechanics, it make the play a bit chaotic.

Overall a very nice game, very light, beautiful themed family game, probably the hardcore gamers would enjoy it less

This game hits most of my sweet spots.  Dice rolling?  Check.  Spatial element?  Check.  Cool 3D cardboard bits?  Check.  Whimsically weird artwork?  Check.  This game should be a worldwide smash hit the likes of Ticket to Ride or Carcassonne.  For me it's the perfect family weight boardgame.  There are plenty of choices to make, you have to think fast, you can roll real fast and put pressure on the other players, and when you're done it's cool to see what you built.  I'm hoping that since Iello picked this up it eventually becomes a runaway hit that it deserves to be.

We had a lot of fun playing the game. There isn't a ton of player interaction since you are really just building your own park and can't effect other people's parks.

There's a lot of fun stuff here.  The dice, the speed aspect, the ride standees, the pulling the meeples from the bag.  I feel like the placement of the rides and stands on your board and watching what the other players are doing is the meat of the game.  The speed thing is really not that big of a deal- just giving or taking a couple waste (soot).  The meeple bag doesn't have much strategy if you are watching they colors the other players are using.  There are some cards which can provide a little direction and strategy which is very good.  Very light game underneath the chrome.

Hunh.  Just read the rules and this looks like it might be an interesting family game to play with the kids.

I just don't get the steam punk theme here and it seems like this game is more about the speed aspect of getting 1st or 2nd place to rid your park of free dirt actions.  The buildings are hard to distinguish between due to the goofy steam punk artwork.  However, I love expanding your little custom park with the rides themselves and filling them with guests.  It's fun and still makes the table which feels about right for a 7+ rating.  Just a little bummed it wasn't quite the roller coaster tycoon like game I'm still in search of.

RATING: 7
Steam Park is a real time dice management game in which you roll your 6 dice and keep the ones you want, re-rolling the ones you don't until you have what you want.  However, it is a speed contest, because the order in which you finish determines player order, and there is a valuable bonus for finishing first or second, and a penalty for finishing last.  Players then use dice to build rides and special power granting pavilions, bring people into the park, score random bonus cards, and clean up waste.  After each round, score for people on rides.  After 6 rounds, highest score wins.  

There is a lot of random in Steam Park - how your dice roll, the bonus cards you draw, the people you pull.  You can mitigate it, but it is there.  This is a light game that will probably be decided by one of the 3 random factors in the end.  However, if you can get past that, it is an enjoyable ride.  The components are great, and the tension of trying to get what you want quickly is very fun, as is the tension of drawing people.  This plays well with children, and is done before it wears out its welcome.

It's the downtime. There's too much of it in this game when played with four players. There is zero reason for me to pay attention during anyone else's turn. Now, there are games where this is acceptable, but this is a very light game, and so when it isn't my turn I have nothing to think about (for my turns), no reason to pay attention to the opponent's actions, and I just completely disengage.

Other than that, the art is cute (but once on your board the rides look less attractive than they do on their own). The dice rolling is stressfull (and frustrating if you roll poorly over and over again while the other players roll well). The robot drawing, while, in theory, interesting, in reality, is quite frustrating.

I imagine I would appreciate it more as a game if there was less downtime and if the frustrating elements were altered.

It remains, however, a game that is different from 99% of the other games released that year. And so worth trying more than 99% of the games released last year.

I like this game a lot for it's unique theme, the color and beauty of the components - you've got 3D roller coasters, and the fun robots you get to draw out of your bag. I love the dice rolling and the unique change of how that works - unlimited rolls but there's a race get better position on the turn order as well. It's tense during the roll phase, but there's various ways to play and different strategies. I wish this hit the table more often because it's a lot of fun.

RATING: 9
A 'must have title' - simple as that. With artwork reminiscent of Machinarium, the theme and style are simply sublime, and integrated well.

The curious combination of mechanics (dice-determined actions, tile laying, randomly drawn guests... all strategic elements that I like in a game) in the title brings a lot of innovation to the table, all of which seem to make for a very tight gaming experience. I personally believe this to be an essential recommendation for any collection.

Even if the English rules translation is a little wonky in places... that adds to its charm! The one criticism I have is of the component cutting quality in the cardboard sprue. Very easy to tear/rumple up the printed layer slightly, and the nobbly notches are rather obvious, which is really rather annoying (and a real shame, as they are otherwise beautiful pieces, so any damage really does stand out). 

A little more player interaction might strengthen the gameplay.

The Galaxy Truckeresque real-time element coupled with finding the optimal balance between cleaning up and development makes Steam Park a thoroughly enjoyable game. I'd probably rate it an 9 if it weren't for two flaws: the Casino, which is a bit too powerful, and the fact that there is no way to mitigate bad card draws. I haven't tried the popular house rule that replaces Casino's power with rerolling and Security's power with discarding cards, but I'm sure it makes the game better.

Gorgeous components, great idea. Sadly the event cards are fundamentally unbalanced. Some cards reward you for building a good park (i.e. by already winning or at least attempting to), some cards reward you for rolling certain types of dice (which ultimately requires you to keep rolling thus probably putting yourself in a worse position). It seems like wilfully perverse that the cards in the first category (i.e. win more cards) give out better rewards than the second type.

In this cute game you're trying to build up an amusement park for robots, and whoever earns the most cash after several rounds wins.  You need to get robots of the correct color to match the rides you build, and then they pay off.  Building stands helps you with all you're trying to do.

One unique aspect is the die roll to start the round - all players are furiously rolling and setting aside dice, then grabbing a tile for turn order.  You might think that would be too chaotic, but it's not really a problem.  One tip for new players - the bonus cards are really where you earn the big bucks, so play them carefully.

While not breaking a lot of new ground, this game is perfectly pleasant, and the right speed for our group.  (Minor quibble - the rulebook is on really flimsy paper which is annoying when you need to refer back to the rules during the game.)

Placement is maddeningly constraining in a way that's not much like real amusement parks, but seems good for the game.

The economics here are just complex enough that I can't work out the math off the top of my head, which is nice. A customer on turn 1 will give (over the game) 18 income and 5 dirt, but how much does that dirt cost me / how much effort does it take to get rid of? Well, it depends.

Tying the dirt accumulation to the time-pressure on action decisions also makes for a nice dynamic - if not for that, I suspect the game would take longer than I'd want for something of its weight. The rewards/penalties might be a little too high for my tastes; we'll see.

"These robot guests are so darn filthy! Look at all this dirt they leave everywhere!"
"--Okay, but why is dirt so toxic?!"

The game was alright, but not great.
Trying to score points in a couple different ways. At the end of the game most points wins, but you'll lose points based on how much dirt you have, so you have to make sure to clean it as the game goes on. The more rides you build and visitors you have -- more dirt. The slower you are to roll on your turn -- more dirt.

Cheap punch-out pieces. No matter how careful you are, the cardboard will rip.

I was intrigued by the real-time dice rolling aspect which adds a bit of tension and anxiety. However, it's not completely vital to roll all of the right results. It is definitely important to "finish" first so you can remove more dirt and enables to you get first dibs on better items. I liked the idea of building your own theme park, but there needs to be a lot of balance adjustments to the game.

It feels like a heavier gateway game for families.

Played the simple rules several times with the family and everyone seems to enjoy it.  It's a pleasant game to play but somehow I leave the game feeling unsatisfied.  Maybe it's not strategic enough for me.  Or perhaps the fast dice rolling is something I'm not great at and find less appealing.

The fun theme really carries this game. The dice are cool, but the rules for rolling them can be somewhat problematic.

Roll em as fast as you can to get the dice you want.  Last person to finish gets the most dirt (which is bad).  Use the dice to build theme-park stuff for points.  Some nice components add to the theme..which is always hard to achieve in a filler game.  Might pick this one up.

Players are theme park entrepeneurs, building, operating and cleaning parks for hard working robots (who need some time off to relax).

Crazy themed, but totally lovable game.  Players roll dice in real time, trying to get results that matches the actions they want to perform.  Actions include building the rides in the park, attracting robots to ride them, cleaning up the ever present coal dust, building information stands, and playing bonus cards.  The goal of the game is to earn the most money, from having robots riding your rides and from bonus cards for matching certain criteria.  Most cash after six turns wins.

Very simple, almost entry level game, featuring cute presentation and game play that is rather joyous.  There probably isn't a lot of game here, but you can say that about Ticket To Ride too.  A nice game that you could play with non-gamers.  Charming.

rimaniamo in 3 quindi riproviamo Steam Park aspetto il gioco da una vita quindi parto molto carico nonostante la prova fatta ad Essen 
Componentistica e disegni sono un colpo d'occhio splendido. 
Note dolenti : L'interazione è data dal solo lancio di dadi iniziale per accaparrarsi una buona posizione nel turno di gioco....e basta 
Occorre specializzarsi nelle giostre visto che non c'è ne sono per tutti...c'è solo una giostra da tre nera quindi il primo che arriva se la prende,io potrò puntare solo su un'altra giostra o su giostre Nere da 1 o 2 anche questo puo' piacere o meno. 
L'aspettativa era alta visto il lungo periodo d'attesa,mi aspettavo molto meglio....invece sono rimasto con l'amaro in bocca..peccato !!

Fairly light dice rolling game where the dice provide resources to build rides, build tents, attract visitors, or clean up the dirt (essentially negative points).   The speed element is really important, and the luck of drawing visitors from the bag can be frustrating.   Components are smaller than expected, and quality of the folding bits is lower than expected.   Reasonably priced family game, fun theme, good art.  I like it better than Escape or Space Cadets Dice Duel, which also hinge upon the same mechanism.   Here you get a break to take actions.

This game ended up being a bit of a disappointment to me. The speed portion is a gimmick, the seeding and drawing from the bag is a non-decision decision point. It's a game that at some point during development it lost its identity. Deep down I really feel that this could have been a pretty successful game (as in Big Box Retailer level success) had it focused on the park building rather than a dice rolling gimmick. What has ended up happening is that the game ends up being forgettable. Too gamy for light casual people and too light for more serious gamers.

This one is hard to classify. On the one hand, it seems quite random, with dice rolling as the central mechanic. Dice rolling with a time constraint, no less. On the other hand, the same people in my group consistently win, so I'm not sure how to classify Steam Park. Other than fun, of course, because it has that in spades. A great game, excellent components. Especially since I magnetized all of the meeples and all of the rides.

[2 plays] This game is from last year, but I’d heard nothing about it before this.  One of my friends happened to play it at the con and then introduced it to me.  It’s actually pretty interesting, unusual and clever. And it’s a relatively short, light game.

The theme is that you’re building an amusement park for robots, which I find hilarious.  As we know, robots work hard all day in the factory, so of course they would like to relax and have some fun.  

The production on this game is excellent, and the art is delightful.  

So here’s the deal: this is a real-time dice game.  Think of the many games (Wurfel Bohnanza, Roll through the Ages, King of Tokyo, etc.) where you roll dice and try to assemble various beneficial combinations.  Steam Park does that, except that the dice rolling is in real time.  Instead of a fixed number of rolls, you can roll and reroll as much as you like—but everyone else is doing so simultaneously with you, and there are bonuses/penalties for the order in which you finish. 
 
Beyond that, it’s building your amusement park—a bit of tile laying, though you wouldn’t call this a tile-laying game because the tiles aren’t really different; it’s more about placement of tiles and components on them.  The laying out your park is a bit like Vegas Showdown or Princes of Florence, in that you have stuff to fit into a space and rules about how elements can relate to each other, but there’s no renovation here; once placed, things stay put.  In addition to the various roller coasters, there are five different kinds of stands you can build; this reminded me slightly of the stands in Zooloretto/Aquaretto, but they do more.  Each kind of stand confers some advantage or special rulebreaking power.  There are also bonus cards that you can play every turn.

And there’s the “dirt” mechanism, which reminded me of waste in Trains, except that it counts directly against your final score.  Many of your activities generate dirt, and there are a couple of ways to clean it up.  It’s also the way the bonuses and penalties for finish order are dealt out. 

Would I play again?  I would definitely play this some more.  I’m not sure about it long-term, partly because I’m so terrible at a central mechanic (the real-time thing), and that might get frustrating in the end.  The friend who kept beating me at this felt that the key to success was not to keep rolling a lot to get just the dice you want, but to take whatever you could get right away and be flexible about using whatever you got.  
Also, on my second/his third game, we were still finding rules errors that significantly would change play.  It’s not that the game has particularly complex rules; I think it was just a con phenomenon of people learning a lot of new games and teaching them to each other without knowing them very well, and thus introducing errors.
So I’d like to play this game some more.  I found it quirky and charming.

RATING: 7
I think this game will end up best with 2.  Rolling the dice quickly, building your park, and solving your cards to maximize your score is incredibly fun.  I think there will always be a casino race, though.  It's clearly the best building.  Since you can't build more than one per turn, it's not a huge issue.

Waiting while 3 other people do it after you with 0 interaction, not so much.

Great components and theme, and I'll gladly play it.  It's also incredibly easy to teach, and all the mechanics fit in with the theme.

Feels like a heavy "gateway" game or otherwise for non-hobbyists in that the decisions are rather bland from a euro game point of view and there's enough randomness with the visitor and card pulls to keep it from being too strategic. I can see someone going straight from Catan to this one and loving it; family game in other words.

I played this and Livingstone both in the same night and they both struck me as disjointed designs in how they mix planning that takes people some time to work out (and slows down the game) and then randomness that can undo the planning or give some players lucky bonuses.

I really enjoyed this game, despite it relying on luck in three different ways -- dice, cards, and pulling meeples out of a blind bag.  The two phases -- hectic dice rolling and thoughtful resource management -- worked well to offset each other and give the game a yin-yang balance.  I also loved the three dimensional pieces and stylized artwork, which really added to the building aspect of the game experience.

This is one of the best themes--you are running a steam punk amusement park for robots. The "rides" are really unique and creative, and the game play is solid. It is not game-changing or anything, but it is good fun, reasonably easy to play, and hits that one-hour game mark that is hard to hit without being too simplistic.

Gameplay is great. Dice rolling is random, something I'm not used to, but it works. I can see cardboard rides wearing after a while. Building the rides and booths and placing them where you want always mixes things up, however there's usually only one or two "right" ways of building rides as not to run out of space. Still, tons of fun and will keep playing!

Egyszerű, gyors, szórakoztató vidámparképítgetés (nem is annyira) őröletes kockadobálással.
A játékban robotok! részére építünk vidámparkot. Az alaptémából már érezhető a játék komolysága.
A szabály nagyon egyszeű, lényegretörő és elég vicces. Pl. Note dobozkák helyett Obvious an boring rules dobozok vannak, amiben valljuk be, van némi igazság.

A lényeg:
1. Mindenki egyszerre dobál 6 kockával. Annyiszor újradobhatsz, amennyiszer csak szeretnél, de amit egyszer félretettél, már nem dobhatod újra. Viszont bünti jár annak, aki a leglassabban végez, és jutalom azoknak akik hamarabb, így meg kell gondolnod, hogy meddig érdemes optimalizálnod a dobásodat, illetve nem árt, ha gyorsán átlátol, hogy egy dobásból pontosan mire is van szükséged.
2. Ha megvagyunk a dobással midenki végrehajtja a kockákon lévő akciókat. Ezekkel új hullámvasút elemeket vagy standokat építhetünk, látogatókat csalogathatunk, célkártyákat játszhatunk ki, területet bővíthetünk vagy éppen takaríthatunk a parkban. Igen bizony, takaríthatunk, ugyanis a játékban fontos a park tisztán tartása is, a robotok olyan sokat mennek a játékokon, hogy mindent telehánynak olajjal (ez tényleg benne van a szabályban ). A játék végén nagy bünti jár a koszos parkért, szélsőséges esetben akár ki is eshetünk a játékból.
3. Pontokat kapunk a látogatók után.

És ez megy 6 körön át.

A játék savát borsát a célkártyák és a standok adják. A célkártyákkal további pontokat szerezhetünk menet közben, és ezek indukálják azt, hogy mindenkinek folyamatosan más irányba kelljen mennie. A standokkal befolyásolhatjuk a kockák értékét, turbózhatunk a dobott eredményeken vagy éppen szabályozhatjuk, hogy ki jöhet be a parkba és ki nem.

A cuccok minősége szuper, nagyon jól néznek ki a 3d-s hullámvasút "makettek".
A játék hangulatos, kb. 45 perc alatt lemegy. Nem nélkülözi a szerencsét, de bőven van benne döntési helyzet. Igazi pihentető játék. Eleinte én is (sejtem, hogy mindenki) féltem ettől a speed dobálás mechanizmustól. De nincs vele semmi gond. Nem annyira a dobás gyorsaságán múlik a dolog, mint inkább a gyors helyzetfelismerésen.

2 fővel is tökéletesen működik és szerintem kifejezetten barátnős/feleséges játék.

Mindeninek ajánlom, aki egy kicsit kuriózum, egyszerű, gyors, kikapcsoló játékra vágyik.

Nálam 8.

I've always loved playing Rollercoaster Tycoon as a kid, and now I have the chance to build my own theme park in a board game. Steam Park looks wonderful, and the game is fun. Yes, you can't really shape your rides or manage things as much as Rollercoaster Tycoon, but this game still requires some planning and some strategice decisions, combined with quick thinking during your dice rolls.

A very nice dice racing game with delicious artwork and feel-good game play. There isn't anything new here but the theme and artwork and mechanics come together rather nicely.  The dice racing works pretty well, though there is a lot you want to accomplish and it's sometimes hard to track what you're going for and looking for that in your dice or knowing when to stop looking.  I like that it ends just when it should, after six rounds. Waiting through other peoples' turns can be a bit of a drag though.

Cute, light fun. Fantastic components. Seems like the game ends a bit too quickly/abruptly. After initial play, feels a bit... insubstantial? I wonder if I'm so accustomed to long epic games of Monopoly, etc. from my childhood that these tidy euros where the game lasts exactly 4 or 6 turns and you to maximize your winnings within those turns make me feel like you never get enough time to really sink your teeth into it.

Not into dexterity games so we "Euro" house ruled it.  For us, start player rotates every turn and we role the dice the equal number of times until someone wants to stop.  The start player wins ties, otherwise whoever stops first chooses the first tile.  

Building your park and attracting robot riders is a fun exercise and the game is quick and light enough for what it is.  More enjoyable that I thought it would be!  Very glad the components don't have to be rebuilt every time and they fit in the box put together.

Interesting mish-mash of real time dice rolling, and spatial management. The components look great, and the end game theme parks look nice, but the theme is kind of tacked on. It's a fairly light game, and goes by quickly. I feel that the last person to finish rolling their dice gets overly punished however, and the first gets overly rewarded. This can lead to a huge imbalance, particularly if someone is way more familiar with the game than other players. Galaxy Trucker has this issue as well.

After one play I can say we are pretty charmed by this game. It's quirky and the art is beautiful and the game is pretty light but there's still a level of strategy to it. 

However, the quality of the components isn't great. After one (careful) play some of the rides and stands seem to already have some wear on them. The insert is flimsy and my box had two ripped corners when I took it out of the shrink wrap.

I am impressed by this game, it's really fun and the components looks very nice (which is not a surprise as the illustrator is the same as Dixit).  We made a lot of fun comments like when my brother sent a love freak to a scary ride or when dirt accumulated to dangerous levels, this usually happens when we are really engaged in the game.  Only downside was when I unpacked the stuff, the components are rather fragile and must be handled with care. Lets see if the rating will rise as I play it more and with more players.

Opinió després d'una lectura de regles:
Joc amb temàtica molt atraient (Theme Park!!!!) però amb tirades de daus simultanees, que tenen diferents accions a les seves cares i que determinen el que pots fer cada torn (al estil GdA). Això no seria un problema si no fos perque cada jugador pot tornar a tirar els daus les vegades que vulgui (apartant els que vol) al estil escape... El primer jugador en acabar serà el primer en ordre de torn i així successivament, com Galaxy Trucker... Té pinta de ser molt divertit les primeres partides i repetitiu les següents (com el Galaxy Trucker)

Good balance between fun & euro.
The short real-time phase where you roll dice to determine your actions & decide player order is fun, but i know some people just don't like any kind of real-time elements in their games.
The artwork is really nice & cutish, as is the whole theme, wich is pretty strong in this one.
You can build toilets to get rid of the visitors waste/dirt!
When you hope to draw the right colored visitor from the bag, good tension mechanic.

All in all a pretty good game. Also you finish the 6 rounds in about an hour, wich is great.

If you're a serious euro-gamer that likes his games predictable steer clear of this one.

After a couple of plays it turns out that the cards are way better to get money than the visitors.. the game hasn't been balanced properly, a pitty.

I normally can't stand dice-based games, but this one has enough strategy and uses dice in such a non-conventional way that makes me absolutely love every minute! Exciting, picks up quickly, and doesn't take too long.

Great game! It looks way more complex than it actually is because it has a lot of cutesy components that adds to the flavor. It is actually pretty straightforward so by the end of the first of the six rounds most people understand what strategy they want to go with and how to play. I recommend just doing a practice turn all the way through then restarting. There is a mechanic of having to grab a tile for turn order and bonuses every round, and some people actually have issues with that physically or mentally so I also recommend just mentioning it that before to all players in case of some issues because I have experienced some players being totally put off by that but I personally think it's fun.

The components are, of course, drop-dead gorgeous. The game is a simple dice-rolling game; it's a Yahtzee mechanic, but it's timed in such a way as to determine turn order.

The balance between money and dirt is an interesting one, but I'd prefer that the way these are distributed didn't depend on the real-time thing. (1 play)

Lovely, thematic theme park building game.  A few nice mechanics going on here, there's the placement of your rides and guests on your park which has some limitations and strategy to it, there's the ever-present threat of more "dirt" in your park - the removal of which must be balanced against expansion and new rides, and there's the simultaneous dice-rolling where you are trying to get the symbols you need but at the same time being sure not to finish rolling last. There are plenty of rule breaking opportunities from the stands in your park, too.

All these simple mechanics come together very nicely here and make for a nicely rounded game.  It plays in a nice time too.

Steam Park has one problem: it can sometimes be a little bit too random. It's not so much the dice-rolling or drawing of visitors, but that the right bonus cards can sometimes fall into one's lap (sort of like Ticket to Ride's Destination Cards, but even more unbalanced).

Other than that, there's not much else to complain about. It's an interesting light game with an assortment of mechanics that somehow work together with an interesting art style and theme as well as a quick sixty minutes or less playtime that is hard to resist.

(Okay, one other complaint: the punchboards that the overwhelming majority of the game's components come from are not cut well, leading to occasional damage of playing pieces. It joins Village in my "Most Annoying Before First Game Setup" Hall of Fame.)

The first couple times I played the game through we played wrong.  Once we fixed those issues, it became apparent to me that there are a variety of strategies (regardless of luck) to go about this game.

I really like this game.  The art is cool and the rule book fun to read.  The theme is fun and attractive.  I also feel like the mechanics of the game work together wonderfully.

As far as gamer games go, it is ok (probably a little too much luck) but nevertheless, I think its a great light hearted game.  This is a game I look forward to playing with my children.

Pleasant, light-medium game of putting visitors (robots) on amusement park rides to earn money while managing the "dirt" they generate from their factory jobs.

I enjoyed it and thought it was different enough from the typical Euro. It's a good game if you don't want something heavy and it moves along at a good clip once you get the concept.

There is some push your luck with rolling and rerolling of the dice, but you can't dawdle and indulge in analysis paralysis because the longer you take, you will get saddled with more and more dirt over time, which undermines your profits (VPs).

It's a bit more than the usual select-an-action mechanic since there are placement considerations of the rides and special tents that you put down (that provide special powers) as well as juggling what dice you wind up with to try and get the most amount of points.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (October 2015)

Steam Park can be a good family game, I wasn’t expecting much from it, but it can be fun with the right game group. The rules are very easy to learn and teach and the game flows quickly so the downtime is low. 

The game components and art are very good. The artist, I think, is the same one who drew Dixit (a game I love), and she did a good job here as well.

The theme is ok, it doesn’t excite me but it doesn’t bothers me either.

I liked that there is a speed element in the game (the best feature of the game), you can re roll your dice as often as you want, but finishing first has its advantages. so this part doesn’t take long and it is fun! After this phase each player play their dice to build their park. This part is very easy as the strategy is obvious. I also liked the rule that says that if, by accident, you changed the face of a dice you have to leave it with the new value.
 
The game has lots of (more or less) uncontrollable luck, first of all with the dice rolling, then with the robot´s bag and finally with the luck of the draw with the cards. The first two don’t bother me as much as you can do things to mitigate their luck, but the cards can be very powerful (perhaps unbalanced?) and there is no way to mitigate what you draw. For me, the cards detract from the fun.

Bottom line, Steam park is a good family game. I would play again if requested but I already sold my copy of the game. I find the game to be too shallow for my current tastes and my desire to play it again is rather low.

Initial impression: This is a fun, frantic dice roller. It has a good mix of thinking/planning and high stress roll as fast as you can until you get what you need! If you like Escape: The Curse of the Temple and a similar idea in a competitive game with a little more going on sounds interesting to you, you should check this one out.

Build an amusement park that keeps the right customers —- with all actions based on the roll of the dice. There are a lot of luck moments in the game, but it is not easy to get a runaway victory.

PLUS: 3D amusement ride pieces, range of options
MINUS: turns are based on speed of dice rolled (meaning bad rolls can kill you), heavy emphasis on luck of the draw

QUIBBLE: some of my pieces were not die cut right and ended up needing to be extracted with an Xacto :(

First impression after first play with 2 players. Good game, nice balance between luck and skill. It seems are several paths to victory.
With 2 players there is no real competition for the buildings, as there are too many of them. Perhaps one should take 1-2 colors out of the game when playing with 2p.

RATING: 6
Another steampunk game where the steam is absent except for the story told in the rules. The components, although nicely illustrated, don't really convey the theme. Not too bad as I don't like steampunk anyway. 
Not unusual for Cranio Creations, Steam Park has an action element. This time, it's speed dice rolling and deciding fast that you're finished with your rolls. The earlier players finish the better the bonus / malus card they get for this round. The slowest player is punished with additional waste which has to be taken care of to avoid huge endgame VP deductions.
The custom dice show one blank side and five different symbols to build attractions, extend infrastructure, attract visitors, remove waste or score VP cards. Once visitors are attracted, they stay until the end and generate income but also waste.
Steam Park is a nice mix of engine building, spatial planning, action elements and randomness (rolls, visitor draws). It is played in less than an hour. The problem is that strategic players will be turned of by the speed element, for fun gamers the engine building and spatial planning could be frustrating. A case of stuck in the middle?

Wonderful game with the same artist who worked on Dixit. Extremely solid mechanisms, with the potential exception of the speed-rolling(although that can be corrected for the slower rollers among us by buying the right stalls).

Enjoy building my amusement park (spatial planning), acquiring the actions (rapid dice rolling), completing objectives (long term planning), all while managing the inevitable dirt a park of this size will produce.  Surprising amount of things to juggle in this family friendly game. However, not a hit with the clan so it's up for trade.

RATING: 5
My first playthrough was a bit mixed. The turn order tiles for 2 players is TOO swingy. It's almost a viable strategy to roll once, and take the tile, forcing your opponent to net 8 additional dirt in the game, while ridding yourself of 8. That can be a 16 dirt swingin a game, which translates to be a ton of points. 

I would recommend using first and third place tiles for a two player game.

RATING: 8
Beautiful little 3D ride and park attractions can be used to build your own steampunk-ish theme park for robots.  You'll be rolling your little custom dice, trying to be quicker than the others so you can get what you want and take your turn when you want, trying to deplete the supply of the bonus stands, and seeing how much income you can generate through your "engine".  But don't forget to clean your park, that dirt will kill you in the end!

We have fun with this. The components add so much character to the game.  I do find the placement rules for how/where attractions can be built to be fiddly.  But all in all, it's a nice family game that is pretty different.

Really wanted to like this one. Good theme. But I didn't end up liking it. The strict placement rules bothered me and made me feel cramped. And the rule that says you have to take a waste penalty if you're last to finish rolling your dice was not well-thought-out. Maybe it was designed to discourage A.P. or infinite rolling, but that wasn't the effect it had in the game I played. I had a plan in my head and was as on the ball as anyone else when rolling my dice; I simply had rotten luck with die rolls throughout the game. Combine that with the fact that those 1st-3rd place markers were gone [i]within 10 seconds[/i] in every round, and the end result is that the person with the worst luck now got even more screwed over. How is that fun? Other games make accommodations for the player in the rear (point-wise or resource-wise), and this adds some balance to the gameplay and a sense of internal fairness. Glad I tried Steam Park, but I'm not really keen on playing it again. Maybe next time I won't be the person with die rolls of a statistically improbable level of suck, but someone will, and I don't want them to be buried in waste on top of that while I receive a trophy for having good luck. TLDR: Good games mitigate the luck factor; Steam Park exacerbates it.

Solid game. I really like the separate stages of each round.

However, the preparation for rolling can cause some AP. What do I need? How many casinos do I have so I can convert my rolls? 

After three plays I found myself slightly underwhelmed with the possibilities. I will probably be done after 10 plays or so. But that is well worth the $30, in my opinion.

At that price, this is a steal, so I had to pull the trigger. We'll see how this is received and maybe I see what other 2-player variants there are of this one.

It wasn't real thinky, it's mostly about rolling dice well in a very short period period of time.  I'm not a great roller for whatever reason and I just spent the whole game behind.  Anyway, maybe I'll like it more as time goes on, and it's cute enough to play again.  We'll see...

Steam Park is an easy-to-learn game with two difficulty levels: one for the less experienced gamers and a more strategic one for those who want a more exciting challenge. In this management game, you'll have to build your own amusement park and make it the largest and most profitable in the region. By constructing the three-dimensional, wonderful rides designed by Marie Cardouat, you will see your park grow right before your eyes. Choose your strategy! Build Stands to attract more Visitors, or Toilets to keep the Dirt under control. Whatever decision you take, take it quickly: The less time you spend planning, the more time you'll have to maintain your park. Thanks to a clever, original action-choosing mechanism, winning in Steam Park is as much a matter of being the best as of being the fastest!

I read a good review of Steam Park and threw it in to a recent order. I'm not really sure if that was a good idea or not yet. On the plus side, it's an utterly adorable game, with a charming design to it and some nifty constructable "rides" that sit on your little boards. I like the dice race element and found it produced a suitably tense round. I also found that, for a game which seemed like it was going to be fairly solitaire, there was a lot of solid interaction, both direct and indirect. That said, the sum of the parts, the game experience itself, was just kind of there. We did it and then we were done. So I just don't know about this one yet.

RATING: 6
It is really cool to watch your amusement park grow in this game, and that you get more points/stand bonuses as the game progresses makes it so that there is kind of a mini engine building feel. The real time rolling of the dice even for someone who normally doesn't like real time was enjoyable for me, as it was basically simultaneous action selection where the AP is transferred from the start of the round to when it's someone's turn. 

Despite its light weight there are many subtle optimizations you can make in this game. First, there is some tricky spatial elements of placing your pieces in this game too (although I'm sure if I actually thought it out I could figure out an algorithm for optimal placement). Secondly, denying your opponents rides or people of their intended color is highly profitable. Thirdly, the dirt adds some neat "greed" aspects, where you want to expand quickly in the beginning to start building your engine regardless of dirt, but you need to reel it all back later in the game. Also, while the chit-pulling of the people can really suck sometimes this is mitigated well with the stands.

The only major downside is that in the end, this game is won mostly by racking in goals, which usually is in conflict with my whimsical desire to just expand my park like crazy.

I am underwhelmed by the graphic presentation of the game. After I played one of the early prototypes years ago, I imagined a much more lush fun park design with lots of gears and steam pipes, similar colored (for gameplay purposes) but totally different attractions in the different sizes (for more visual variety), but the actual presentation is lacking unfortunately (for starters: why not make it a "steam park at night" with black backgrounds like it was done on the cover …).
That is not to say that the overall presentation is ugly or bad - far from it! My expectations just were too sky-high ...
I still have to see about the actual gameplay changes - the speed dice rolling instead of just speed-selecting your actions (which was the mechanic of the first iteration of the game) sounds like a fun idea.
I absolutely loved the gameplay of the prototype (type: perked-up family game). My rating is for the early version I played and could change.

This game has some super cool aspects to it, but I'm hard pressed to say I love the whole package.  The components are fantastic and my most enjoyable plays have been with my kids, who love the rides and the little robots.  Overall the game is fairly easy to teach and offers some good planning and options to focus on certain strategies.  My main sticking point is the "who can roll the fastest" beginning phase of each round where players roll their dice and grab a turn-order marker.  This is the most potentially punishing part of the game since it severely penalizes players for not being early in turn order.  I use some variants to somewhat resolve this, but I hate needing to use house rules to 'fix' an otherwise great game.

This one straddles the line between gateway game and light-medium tactical.  It's quite simple, but there are a lot of choices, and there's a surprising amount to calculate when deciding what you want to roll for and then again when you play out your dice.

The theme is fun, and the components are absolutely stellar, as is the art.

This would be on the upper end of difficulty for the non-gamers I know.  It's fun with 2, but I think it would be better with 3 or 4.  Downtime can happen as players figure out their moves.  There is definitely "strategy" to be had as you learn the game, and there are strategic paths to pursue, but it's really more tactical once you understand how the mechanics come together.

I very much enjoy the game and think it's a very high 7 or 8.

An interesting little frankengame that combines a bunch of different styles together. It's somewhat of a speed and coordination game at the beginning. It's a spatial game. It's a planning game. Most of all, it's a pretty, pretty fun game that's deeply accessible to all kinds of people. Love it!

The downtime was unbearable. Game was ok but the mechanics should support more simultaneous actions. Now even planning is pointless because the thing you want may or may not be there when it's your turn. Components were nice enough.

RATING: 7.5
While the strategy is quite clear (get robots on your rides as quick as possible) and there is very little scope to hinder your opponents, this is just an absolute joy to play.  Sure, the outcome is ultimately determined by who rolls best (and fastest) and who draws the most matching robots, but because it plays so brilliantly, I can forgive those flaws.  I can't forsee a time where I would turn down a game of Steam Park.

You build fairground rides and stalls and try to fit them into spaces your park, which you can extend. Dice have symbols which determine what build actions and visitors are available. Dice are rolled simultaneously and as soon as you are happy with the result grab a turn order marker, so you need to be fast. If you are the last player you get 3 additional dice rolls to complete your turn.

I love the "dirt" mechanic and how many times i've lost a game because of it.
At  the same time, it's quite a nice puzzle figuring out the best way to place all the stuff you start building, and how to better expand your building zone.

I recommend it!

RATING: 6
Delightful dice-driven fun; downside is the down time while others decide on allocations. Quite a bit of luck involved (not just the dice rolling, but also a VivaJava-like mechanic of trying to select the right color meeple from a bag of somewhat-known probabilities).
-----
a game that's good for two plays. Or possibly one, with the second confirming that there's no further depth to be had. Downgrading from 8.5, and traded away.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
Easy to teach, fast to play economic game featuring several mechanics that, while not revolutionary, they add up to great effect.

Dice rolling and pawn blind drawing provide a decent amount of luck factor that can be controlled to a degree (you can skip the bonus and keep rolling the dice and you can soften the luck factor of pawn drawing with some stands).

In combination, it's a very fun gateway game that plays under an hour. Maybe it's not ideal for people totally new to the hobby, but it's 100% recommended to those ones that have already played a couple of other games.

Downside:
-> I don't know how much lifespan it can have. The game will play out differently because of the luck elements, but you'll be doing the same in every game. I guess this can be tiresome after X games. The bonus cards can grant some diversity, but I see people tending to keep the same strategy in every game.
-> I think this would have been a good game for up to 6 players (the dice rolling part is simultaneous). Maybe an expansion will solve this?

Received in a math trade (5/15/14).

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I really loved the theme and art of this game, building a theme park is a lot of fun thanks to the great components. I had a lot of fun playing this with my family, unfortunately after 10+ plays it started to get repetitive and my kids lost interest in playing. The real limitation of the game is the placement rules for the rides and buildings, after a while you realize that there really isn't that much variation in how you set up your park. 

There are also some buildings that are much better than others which leads to a very similar game play experience because everyone tries to be the first to grab those buildings. Same thing with the scoring cards, there are really only a few different ways to score points with the cards, the color just changes (i.e one cad is green rides vs. another card being blue rides.

That being said we enjoyed the game and it is a great family game, but after about 12 plays you've seen and done it all. Playing it a couple of times a year would still be fun and the game would feel fresh, but I don't keep family games in our collection if they aren't going to see a lot of play. However; I think 12 plays is great for this style of game and we enjoyed the ride while it lasted.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Awesome artwork! I love all of the different rides this game is a visual feast for the eyes. 
I love building my park and seeing all of theses cool rides and robots in it.
- Great placement rules for the rides, they force you to really plan out your park in advance. It adds a great spacial puzzle to the game play.
- Easy to teach to new players.
- Great family game, my kids love the theme and game play. 
They find the simultaneous dice rolling a lot less stressful than in Escape.
- The "dirt" mechanic really ratchets up the tension in this game since you can not just focus on building the best park. 
- Multiple paths to victory, especially if you use the special powers of the different stands you can buy.[/i]

Initial feelings that this game is a lot of fun. A little bit of reflexes involved. Will see if it gets old after time. I haven't tried the info booth yet, nor the security booth.

RATING: 7
Everyone's going to be rolling together, and the faster you declare yourself finished, the more pollution you can remove, so finishing first is good, but not necessary if you're not getting something you'd really like. What you roll determine what actions you're going to take - build, populate, unpollute, play a card for VPs or build an ongoing benefit - and how many of each you're going to do. So the trick is to have an idea before you start rolling of a couple of combo's you'd like to see and go for them. Because there's only 6 rounds, you really don't want to waste a turn on a set of actions that doesn't reap much long term benefit. So there's lots of goodness here. There's some luck-based downside on whether you populate or not (you need to draw a colour meeple in the colour you've built a ride in). This can swing a game if you draw poorly and others draw luckily, as that's points in the bag for this turn and future turns that you don't have, plus the waste of an action this turn. This is the one thing stopping me rating the game higher, because otherwise it's interesting and fun to play.

Steam Park ist ein anspruchvolleres Familienspiel. Durch die kurze und recht hektische Würfelphase erscheint die Aktionsphase länger, als sie wirklich ist. Die Auswertung der Würfel dauerte in keiner meiner Runden allzu lange. 
Die Funktionen der Stände und die spielerische Vorbereitung auf das optimale Ausspielen der Bonuskarten hebt den Anspruch über das "normale" Familienspiel hinaus.
Glück beim Ziehen der Besucherroboter kann durch den Informationsstand und Würfelglück durch das Kasino ausgeglichen werden.
Interaktion besteht lediglich darin, den Gegenspielern bestimmte Attraktionen vor der Nase wegzuschnappen.
Die gelungene Graphik unterstützt den Spielspass.
Die Idee trägt die Spieldauer. 
Insofern werde ich Steampark immer wieder gerne spielen.

Steam Park is a Yahtzee-style dice-rolling game where you're allowed to re-roll the dice as many times as you want.  The catch is, everyone is rolling their dice simultaneously, and the order in which you declare that you're done rolling determines the penalty you take, and the penalties for being last are very severe.  I really didn't enjoy this speed game element at all.  The rest of the game involved putting together an amusement park with some really nice bits, but the gameplay didn't stand out enough to make me get over my distaste for the speed dice rolling.

I like the theme of the game very much: build amusement parks! It's very fun to play, as you race to play your dice first and attract guests for your park. However, I don't rank it higher, as the casino booth is very overpowered and literally the only way to proceed in this game. Still, I usually enjoy this game.

I got to play this game on my birthday at GameHaus!

This is a pretty light and straight forward game that saw a lot of love at the cafe (the rulebook is wrinkled like mad). It has a real time element in it so it's tough to balance luck/strategy/speed in this little game.

The game is charming and I didn't feel the over-powerness of the casino. My fiancee lost to me because she wasn't keeping up with cleaning the dirt. 

I like it better than some 7s in my collection but it is definitely not a 8 material. With my play I can tell the game will probably last 5 plays and then it will get boring. I am glad I didn't purchase this game with my 2014 budget.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
+ Very nice material
+ You have to make some interesting choices during the game
+ Theme is strongly present

- Simultaneous dice rolling: it will never be my favourite game mechanism in a game that should be strategic
- I don't think that it's a good idea that some bonus cards are more then once into the deck. Let's say you have 1 that gives money for the number of stands you have and you decide to invest in it. After a while you decide you have enough stands to cash the bonus card in. If you then later in the game can get hold of the double copy, you just get (lots) of money 'for free' as you don't 'have to work for it' anymore.

This is a solid filler game, which is sort of reminiscent of a lot of bits of other games. You roll your dice as many times as you like until you get your result you want, but there are bonus cards to grab for the first players who are done, so you are under some time pressure. Then you use your dice to build rides, expand your board, or try to get meeples to sit on your rides (which is what is ultimately worth points, and the mechanic is stolen from Village where you put guys in the bag and hope to draw them out again). It's fun and it has these semi delicate 3d constructable ride tokens that are pretty cool looking.

Real-time dice-rolling to select your actions for a turn is clumsily bolted on to an individual-board optimisation Euro that's too fiddly for its weight class. And despite being way overproduced, the players' finished theme parks still look disappointingly barren thanks to the unusually restrictive placement rules. Much preferred Barenpark for a 'build your own park' game.

This game has not nearly as much depth as I thought it did (why I thought that I can't quite recall), regardless it has some amount of complexity that I hope to unravel with more plays.

Additional plays show that there are multiple ways to win, but which one you do is more drive by your dice and your bonus cards, and neither of those things are super in your control. The rating is not going up with repeated plays, suffice to say. Started at 7, now at 5

I dislike speed games so keep that in mind. 

You roll dice to determine actions to perform on the turn. Build rides to attract robots to ride some are one and done others stay and score for the rest of the game. Put up stands to which are action modifiers. Seed riders to your rides play bonus cards for extra points depending on the state of your park.

Your tableau has restrictive building rules and the speed rolling determine who has turn order, gets a bonus with the last player taking a pretty heavy penalty.
I found the complex park tableau to be quite at odds with the speed rolling.

Liked the bag draw seeding mechanic for riders and theme but but detested the speed rolling aspect.
Will avoid.

This was an alright game. Played a bit long for me with the strategy being somewhat light as it is. I also didn't love the real time dice rolling aspect--it felt very random that my opponents could possibly roll well, and get a benefit for getting what they wanted first, while others would then get penalized for it. Hard to say the winner played better with those factors taken into account.

In Steam Park the most notable feature is the simultaneous dice rolling. Each player gets six custom dice which they roll untill you have what you like and then you grab a bonus token, unless you are the last player still rolling, you only have two more rerolls left and you get a malus token.

The dice give you actions like building an attraction, build a special building, cleaning up dirt, trying to get customers, expanding the park or playing a bonus card.
The game looks awesome due to the fantastic artwork on the 3D attractions and it is absolutely fun to play. The dice rolling is very engaging and after that you may construct on your little theme park.

Nice theme, great art, nice game play for about an hour. Recommended.

Steam Park is a prototypical example of what I don't like about contemporary middle-weight Euros:

* Limited, indirect, and ultimately uninteresting player interaction
* Hidden, randomly determined personal objectives, which dramatically reduces strategic depth and player interaction -- players are not going to bother to deduce what objectives their opponents' have, nor do they have the time to hinder them
* Bloated with too many rules and mechanisms considering the game's strategic and tactical shallowness

I like a lot of things about this game- the real-time dice rolling, the dirt, the scoring... but I really don't like the limit on the different park items (roller coasters, tents, etc.) It tries to reward getting the 1st player token, but it's only about 5 minutes into the game before something sells out. Maybe if there was as wider variety of items of equal power, this would be less of a problem.

Steam Park is still a fun game, but I think it could use an expansion to even it out

Fun and frenetic simultaneous dice rolling game about building a theme park. Given that you can roll and re-roll your dice as many times as you like, at least until the other players pass, there are some interesting decisions to be made about what you are going to "go for" on any given turn. How you build your theme park is also a fun challenge, as the adjacency rules can severely restrict where you can place future rides and other buildings. It may be a tad too long for what it is, and for such a light game, it has a huge table footprint. The production gets high marks - it's really fun to build these cardboard standee rides and watch your theme park develop in three dimensions before your eyes. Would play again, but I think that there are other light dice rolling games and other "super fillers" that I'd probably reach for first.

Nice family game, with some spatial puzzling and engaging, 3-dimensional components. The Yahtzee-style dice rolling has the twist of time pressure, such that you try to have your wanted results before others have finished rolling their dice. In the end, this game has a really huge luck component: the dice obviously contribute to that, but  also what kind of scoring cards you get and if you draw customers of the right color from the bag. If you have bad luck with customers, your park will luck empty and you will lose. The theme of an amusement park is well captured, but I would ignore any steam-punk connection; the colors (blue, turquoise) do not match and why you should have robots as customers is just silly. I suspect the title should sound like "theme park", but that title sure has  some copyright issues.

at first this seems like kind of a random-fest but there is a real puzzle within this game.  This is a puzzle game that has a some randomness that can be mitigated via bonus cards and sly use of your stands.  These stand give you special abilities and that must be used in a certain order to help you throughout your turn and here the puzzle begins.  its very kingdom builder like in that way.  Plays very fast and a fun dice game.

Got a chance to play this game with 2 friends and I loved it! The quick dice rolling aspect adds an element of suspense, and you are always choosing between taking the worse roll or the disadvantage. The game incorporates several game mechanics that I have seen in other games as well, and they work together very well in this game. Plus, I love the theme!

Steam Park is a great game the family will love that is simple to pick up, but lends itself to some good strategies.

Build a theme park, where the theme is "separate but equal" as you earn more money from black robots if they ride black rides. Looks great on the table with 3D set pieces that were illustrated by Tim Burton's bastard child (probably).
Recommended!

An enjoyable light dice rolling game.  Roll your dice, don't end up with too much dirt (penalty  points), and try to make the best use of the dice and cards you have to get VPs.  A lot of fun, and shorter than the listed box time.

The punching and setup took a long while!

I was actually surprised by this game. I won it at a gaming event (raffle) and thought "another dust collector". It turned out to be entertaining. The game mechanics are simple to teach, and the artwork is fun and inviting, even to the non-gamer. My 8 year old loves this game. She wants to play all the time, which I like because it gets her nose out of the iPad. It won't be something I pull out for my group, however I can see pulling this out with non gamers who want to be entertained. A well made game.

I sort of wish there were a little more going on - maybe a few more rides. It would be interesting to see if an expansion would add a little more depth.

That said, it's quite fun, and I really like the dice-rolling and re-rolling mechanism. I enjoy the art quite a bit (though my components weren't the best quality), and it's pretty fun to manipulate the odds of pulling different color meeples and then taking them and putting them on the rides. I suppose another quibble would be that it seemed way too easy to get rid of dirt. I could be missing a rule, but it didn't seem like anyone had any problems at all keeping their parks clean while still doing a lot of other actions. It might be interesting to see more dirt accumulate and have to make some tougher decisions about when to build and when to clean up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice little game. I usually don't like games that rush you into making decisions (as in the dice-rolling phase in this game), but the rest of the game is pretty good. Placement rules are very restrictive and I feel like that could have been implemented better as well. But there's a pretty solid game underneath these minor blemishes.

 I am a little concerned with optimization, and I think that eventually we will feel like we are stuck doing the same thing more often than not in this game. However, I like it for now.

This was a birthday gift for my wife in January 2014.  This game was so much fun to play from the first game almost a year ago to the last game I played with my wife a couple nights ago.  I taught this game as a new release featured at LexiCon Gaming Convention in Lexington, KY back in May 2014.  It looks fantastic on the table and it is appealing enough to welcome bystanders to play as well.  I appreciate the uniqueness of the game in its look and theme so that it should stay in my collection for a long time.  I hope that this game can stay in print and get an evergreen status over the next couple years. It's a great family game and it provides a memorable game play experience.

I have no idea what people see in it. Another euro tableau building with some stuff and that stuff and yawn. But they say simultaneous dice rolling, well, uhm, yay. It adds tension and that's it, I'm not sure if that's good or bad or doesn't even matter. Sure there's many interesting mechanics in it - drawing visitors out of the bag and so on, but at the end of the day it's just another euro where you build stuff.

Visuals are another case of illustrator failing in graphic design - the role of illustrator is to make the game look nice, the role of graphic designer is to make it readable and easily playable. Dear publishing people, employ graphic designers. 

Rating down to 1.0 - why does this exist? Uninspired. Unreadable.

It's quite a neat game at its heart: a dice-roller where you have to make decisions fast because the slower you are, the more dirt your park accrues - which is bad. But it's a small game in a big box and to us it felt like it should last 30 minutes, not twice that.

The artwork is cool, but that's about all I can say that I like about this game.  While the game is interesting, it's just not that exciting.  There is very little player interaction and there is a lot of downtime while each player takes his turn.  The simultaneous dice rolling mechanism to determine actions and player order isn't frustrating at best.  Once a player has a couple stands, not more than two rolls seems necessary.  Also, it seems to make sense to trade in at least one goal card per turn even it it only yields 2 or 3 points rather than trying to go for the occasional bit point scores.  Also, the random drawing of visitors from the bag can be EXTREMELY frustrating and can really ruin any chances of getting points or money.  Overall, I'm just not seeing what all the hype is about this game.  It's just okay.

Thoughts after 2P and 4P games

The Good: Great theme, easy to play. As good with 2 and 4 players. Plays in around the hour mark. A ninice balance between luck and strategy.

The Bad: Not much, other than setup time a bit long for the game time. Have found some of the stalls to be either too powerful or just not worth buying.

Still one of my favourite buys from 2014.

Solid game, a bit of a cross of Galaxy Trucker meets O Zoo le Mio. I like that you're rolling quickly to get your actions combined with the challenge of placing the rides to fit correctly. The bits are pretty neat, in that it does have a nice three-dimensional effect of building an amusement park.

RATING: 4
Luck-filled game that asks players to build an amusement park on individual player boards subject to spatial constraints and set collection bonuses. It's a bit like Zooleretto with engine building and without Zooleretto's central mechanic. Instead, the game uses dice for action selection and provides several scoring opportunities throughout. The components are nice and there's an audience for the game, but I have never wanted to build an amusement park, and there's too much luck and not enough interaction for my tastes. Everything "works", just not for me.

RATING: 6.5
1 play, 4er

It's a light family game, each turn starting with a quick dice-rolling phase then ending with a somewhat slower, more thinky, implementation phase. The first part of each turn was fun; the later part could do with a little more speed (or maybe some of us just needed to play more quickly?)! The game is certainly pretty, but not one I need to own. Decent, though!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Each player gets a 8x8 (?) personal play board, and a hand of 3 VP cards. There are 6 colors of roller coasters in sizes 1, 2, and 3, available in Supply, as well as 5 types of kiosks. (Everything is beautifully illustrated.) Players each get 6 dice. 4 Turn Order cards are placed in the middle.

Players simultaneously roll their dice, locking 1+ dice until all are locked, at which point they grab the earliest turn order marker available. When only one remains, that player gets only 3 more rolls of the dice. Then everyone takes as many dust counters as indicated on their dice. 

In turn order, players then use their dice to:
- acquire roller coasters
- try to attract visitors: add colored meeples to the bag, draw as many out, keep and place any of the color(s) matching your coasters if you have space
- discard dust tokens
- acquire kiosks: each modifies rules in some way, e.g., discard more dust, rotate a die to a new face, accept mismatched visitor colors, etc.
- expand your park (with a 4x4 piece?)
Everything acquired is placed on your board, but may only be adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to to something of the same color. They may also play any of their VP cards, which reward coins for various combinations of stuff (e.g., having a bunch of blue visitors, rolling a bunch of blanks, etc.).

Everyone then gets income from all their visitors, and draws more cards (draw 2 per missing card, discarding half of those).

After 6 rounds, the game ends. Players pay for any remaining dust tokens (at an escalating rate), and the player with the most remaining coins wins!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The Yahtzee mechanic is big right now.  I feel like for the past couple years there have been a lot of Yahtzee-style dice games.  This is another and like most Yahtzee-style dice games this one is reasonably simple.  It also plays quickly though so it makes for a good filler.

The game has players competing to build the best and most attractive steam-powered amusement park in order to draw in robotic patrons that will generate money.  The player with the most money at game end wins.  At the start of each round the players are quickly rolling dice simultaneously in real time until they get a set they are happy with and grab the earliest turn order marker available (much like Galaxy Trucker).

The turn order markers not only give players the advantage of going earlier in the round but also the earlier you go you get to clean up more dirt from your park.  In fact, the slowest player generates more dirt.  Dirt is the cost of success in this game.  Half of the sides of the dice produce dirt and the more patrons visiting your park the more dirt they produce.  At the end of the game you have to pay a cleanup fee that gets exponentially higher the more dirt you have in your park.

After the rolling of the dice players take actions based on the dice they rolled.  The actions are cleaning up dirt, building rides or stands, attracting patrons, and playing bonus cards.  Aside from the patrons themselves the cards provide the best income source and make this game a little more gamey than simple Yahtzee.  They will produce different amounts of money based on criteria like the color rides or types of stands you have.  This is one of the best ways to direct what kind of part you build.

I like the balance of real time action with strategic park building and it really does play easy and fast.  This is a fantastic filler game.  I will say I was disappointed by the lack of variety in the park rides though.  Aside from the different art each set is exactly the same.  I think it would be neater to have more differently shaped rides kind of like putting together tetris pieces.  As it is I am a bit afraid the game will get bland after a number of plays.

Really fun family game. Build a theme park by rolling dice to take actions. 3D components are cardboard, but really fun and visually catching and fun to build. Different ways to score points and special stalls you can build help mitigate luck from dice. Also, no limit on re-rolls, although if your the last to "lock-in" you roll, you'll get a slight penalty.

Good game for introducing casual players to slightly more complex mechanics like actions-within-turns, some resource management, finishing out side-objectives for more VPs, modular independent player boards. Important to note that the game is still heavily dependent on a yahtzee-like dice rolling mechanic, and there's blind drawing from a bag, both of which still add a lot of luck/chance (a bit too much luck/chance for my personal tastes which brings down my score of the game). The tokens that represent parts of the amusement park are so well designed and fun to pick up and place onto player boards.

Quite a fun game, as always with Cranio Creations.
I like the real time plannig phase and drawing customers from the bag.
Not that deep, but you don't expect depth from Cranium, but laughts. Maybe less fun than previous games like Dungeon Fighter.

This is a competitive dice rolling game, where you use the dice you roll, but the faster you get your dice set, the better off you are. 

There are buildings you can buy, but some of them felt quite a bit more powerful than others. Overall, the game was ok, but there seems to be a lot more luck involved than you might think.

I really enjoy this fast paced dice based games. You are building a theme park for robots and who doesn't love doing that?! The placing of your rides and stands is very tight and I have been really messed up by that. The casino is very powerful but this is balanced by there only being four of them and only being able to take one of each stand on each turn. 

Also, it is a beautiful game :)

May play again. I'd give it a 5.5 right now, and I did enjoy it, but it left a sour taste in my mouth. 

The game self-regulates, meaning that a player can't just build rides and acquire riders because they create too much dirt. Which seems okay at first, but is oddly counter-intuitive. In fact, it's like taking loans in a Euro game. You can have like 3 or 4 riders and still be okay, but once you get 6 or more, you msy get locked in a death spiral.

It rewards incremental improvements and meandering, which means it'll be great as a filler, but it's slightly too long for that. Looks pretty tho.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Didn't realize there was dexterity at the beginning of each round, which sort of kills it for me.
There seems to be a basic dominant strategy to win, so it's really just on the dice rolls and doesn't feel like there's enough variety.

Quite a unique theme and good mechanisms, in particular i like the risk/reward of the 'dirt', do you keep rolling your dice to get what you want? or do you need to finish quickly to grab the first turn marker? I very much enjoyed it and so did my group so looking forward to more plays.

Decent little short game. Cool theme, and can be a challenge to grow your park and keep it clean. the mad dice rolling dash is a little crazy, and some of the cards and tents seem overpowered.

RATING: 6
Decent fun and decisions to be made in this fairly short (< 1 hr) dice rolling/action selection game. As expected, luck factor is fairly high with the dice and the customer pulls from the bag. Player interaction is fairly low, and the speed rolling seems a bit out of place, although it does keep the game moving along quickly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Great game and a lot of fun. The rolling of the dice is something of frantic frustration ... but that is my only complain. Great for casual gamers. Euro gamers may not like the dice mechanism (roll fast to finish rolling first).

RATING: 6
Steam Park is a fun little game, but it's not really my cup of tea.

Players build out their park for cash.  Main elements are finite resources that are competed for, real-time dice rolling to quickly line up your turn, and then strategically placing elements of your park in a way that will allow you to build out as efficiently as possible.

If you're into games that feature strong "sandbox" or building elements, you will probably love this game.  Anyone who likes to create systems will also really dig it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
I was a little iffy going into this one.  A real time dice rolling contest didn't exactly sound like it was going to be a good fit for me.  And to be honest, it did entirely prove that I'm neither good at rolling dice nor good at rolling dice fast.  But I actually ended up liking this game a fair amount.

It a very cute game where you are building an amusement part.  The game comes with beautiful carboard structures depicting various amusement park rides which you can actually place meeples into.  The game revolves around building rides and stalls, soliciting customers, and scoring bonus cards.  There's a dirt penalty for doing too many build actions, having too many visitors or taking too long to roll dice.  I ended up losing 36 points at game end for failing to pass the health inspection. :)  

It's not the deepest game in the world, but it's far from the lightest.  And you can reroll dice freely until you get what you want (unless you're the slowest roller) so the random aspect isn't usually a problem.

When you've learned the rules, this is very simple and fun to play, but all the different pieces that you have to set out makes it very intimidating to new players. The one mechanic some people might not enjoy is the dice-rolling phase, where the quicker you finish, the better reward you get.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Unique game, with a very cool theme.  It's fun to play, and the turns are quick.  However, the big downside is the number of moving parts.  So many little pieces, that don't fit together really great.  It's a must-buy, in my book.  But it's not really a must-play.  You may only get this out occasionally, but it's cool enough to own.

Nicely designed, great looking pieces, well done rules, and fun goofy play.  Some may not like the real time speed dice rolling, but sometimes games should be about a few laughs and chucking them bones.  Don't forget to clean the dirt or your amusement park will close down.  If you are playing with kids you can start everyone with a Casino in play or make the dice rolling a simultaneous, we all roll at the same time, to be less rushed and more family friendly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
When you take away the graphic design and "realtime dice rolling", Steampark is a very pleasant, light, typical SdJ contender. It is easy to teach and learn, plays fast and has the right amount of luck to feel like a family game. But the graphic design and theme make this game really stand out, and the dice rolling fits wonderfully well, making this game pretty unique in terms of look and feel. I do recommend using the alternative rules for the Casino and Security stands, as suggested in the BGG Forums.

1st impressions: Ok game but some flaws. Theme and scoring divorced. Lacks player interaction. Real-time rolling feels unnecessary. Bag-building seems like it is open to abuse - if you pull nothing you feel like you've wasted your die (your colour will be gone by the time your turn comes back around), if you pull what you want you feel as though people think you used sleight of hand to cheat. Could be improved with a second edition ruleset.

I like how quick the game moves, visually of course it's great fun to look at.  It's always enjoyable to build your own little place in front of you.  I enjoy the speed aspect of the game since it's a pretty small part of every turn, it keeps things lively.  Might not be for some fuddy-duds, you know who you are.

Think the game falls into an awkward place where it's mostly a family game, but can be tricky to teach, and heavy gamer's won't find much to keep them interested long term.

Good, fun, simple, speed dice rolling game. Applauded before/at Essen for its great components but I found them meh then and still do now, and they turn out to be completely pointless and could just as well (and possibly better) be flat cardboard. But the gameplay is good fun with interesting decisions under stressful time pressure.

RATING: 5
I really wanted to like this game (I dig coasters and theme parks, and spent an inordinate amount of time playing RollerCoaster Tycoon on the PC back in the day), but it winds up being too many different things to really settle on what it wants to be.  The dice-rolling reminds me of Escape, and the turn order grab reminds me of Galaxy Trucker, but the rest of the game is just a bland mixture of placing things on personal boards and hoping to roll/place better than the other players.  There's a neat thing happening where the rush to be first can force players to overlook the dice they need, but there's really nothing here that makes me think there's much of a game behind the design.

I think some folks will really love real-time games but far out they can feel exhausting! I'm not really one to rush in real-time - I like taking quick turns and thinking through strats super-fast, but real-time dynamics just don't click for me in board games. Steam Park still manages to be a fun game, but the waste dynamic punishes players who can't decide on strats based on their random results, especially when the results aren't given to being competitive vs other players' midgame achievements.

Typically I am not one to throw around the word "unbalanced" when speaking of games, but this time it may be an accurate description.  But, with that said, I wouldn't mind playing this game occasionally.  I just can't take it too seriously.

Unfortunately i dont like games (like Escape) where you throw dice over and over as fast as possible trying to reach your goals. It is too prone to cheating and chaos.
That said, it is surely much better than Escape... at least there is organization, planning, strategy. You can aim at bonus cards, you can invest in kiosks for flexibility or you can just try to expand as much as you can. You can decide to disregard garbage or not and this is also important as a planning choice.
Components look very nice but the owner of the box told me the different attractions are a pain in the a55 to assemble as the cardboard is low quality. Anyways, it looks nice.

I must say this game is a breath of fresh air, You have the luck factor of the dice but you do have options open to you if you don't roll everything you want. The first time you play just use the tents as 3 points instead of their abilities. It makes it easier to play. The reason I gave it an 8 rating is the tents. They are hard to tell the difference between them sometimes when they are on your park. I wish they would have made them different shapes or colors. I may put labels or something on them to help. Other than that I highly recommend this game. Fun and easy to play but even with the dice you have a lot of strategy left to win.

Amazing. You build a theme park run on steam. Robots go to your park, I don't know why, but reasons. The game is awesome. Only six rounds and I get to roll the dice until I'm satisfied? Kind of. The amazing 3D aspect of building the park really pops and looks good on the table. On top of that, a solid game is built in. I like how there is tactical point scoring woven into an almost abstract game. Good moral too: dirt is bad :laugh:

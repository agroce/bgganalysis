Apart from a slightly badly written manual, no fault here. An OK deck building game where you scrap the cards accumulated once you use them for a recipe. It tends to be on the longer side for a game of its magnitude. which might be a downside (although you can tune it to lower final VP score triggering the end of game). Would play it again.

This game seems a bit fiddly and over-complicated for what it is, and I don't love the reliance on so much iconography on the cards.

After playing it at Chupacabracon 3 on 14MAY2016, I purchased it from Dani Demarest, the designer, who also signed it.   It's a fun, differently themed deck builder which I may be able to use as a gateway game with my SO for Dominion and others.

Pretty decent, cooking-themed card game. Think "Iron Chef: The Deckbuilder". It makes some interesting mechanic choices, and still keeps a small footprint (physically and mentally). It uses the star-realms-style market row purchasing mechanic, and encourages (though doesn't require) thematic play.

I've found it works nicely with the house-rule that submitted meals must sound delicious, rather than merely make mechanic sense.

It's Chopped - the board game. Beautiful artwork for a complex deckbuilder that challenges your creative cooking. Recommended to any and all foodies and gamers alike.

Cuisine a la Card is a deckbuilding game with a cooking theme. It was better than expected.

The rules of the game are easy, but there are many rules. You can explain it under 13 minutes. There are a lot of icons on the cards, but they are easy to understand.

The game has a cool and novel theme, but you don’t feel you are cooking through the game.

As most deckbuilding games, Cuisine a la Card is best played as a two player game.

In general, I love deckbuilding games, but I hate deckbuilding games that offer a variable market offering (Legendary, Ascension, Star Realms) because they decrease the strategy a lot in favor of (almost) pure tactics. Having saying that, Cuisine a la Card is, arguably, among the best ones in that category.

I really like the function of the warming trays, they allow you to save cards for the future so preparing dishes isn’t a random endeavor, however, the luck factor is high in the game (a minus for me).

I’m not sure about the replayability of the game, it seems it comes with too few cards, on that same note, it seems the price is a bit expensive for what comes in the small box.

Bottom line, Cuisine a la Card is an ok deckbuilding game, one I would play if requested, but I don’t think I will buy it. Dominion is still king for me in this category. The theme is refreshing though!

感想：
1. 入門級很好的牌庫構築遊戲
2. 主題性好，美術也不錯
3. 玩完有種基本牌庫構築元素也有，但也好像不到力的感覺
4. 牌要洗混是很重要的

This is an excellent game.  I participated in the Kickstarter and have officially received my copy.  I have played it with my board game friends, extended family members who aren't as big into games, and my own 6 & 9 year old children.  Everyone so far has enjoyed this game.  The rules are simple enough that even my 6 year old daughter can play along and enjoy herself, but the abilities of the cards definitely scale to some more interesting action for older and/or more experienced players.

The theme is really fun, and this definitely seems like a home run hit to me!

This is so far not an interesting game. Looks really neat and the theme is funny but the game play just doesn't keep up with the concept. The fact that you have to discard all the ingredients when presenting a dish feels like you have to start over again with collecting ingredients. So consequently the pacing is off, you move from slow to efficient to slow to efficient, etc.

The permanent abilities of the judges help, but not always significantly. Am a bit disappointed in this one.

I want to like this more.  And I suppose it is a fine desk builder.  It just didn't wow me and after the first play, I really didn't feel like picking it up again.

Damn good deck builder.  Limited choice of cards per round.  Slow in the start, speeds up durring the end game.

A well designed game, good artwork and a pretty easy deckbuilder to teach.  The only criticism we've really found is the inevitable shortage of Judges.  Blank templates to make your own would be great.

One of the wife's favorites. Has a very interesting ebb and flow for a deck builder as you give up all the cards you've just worked on building your deck with. Have to be careful at the higher play counts as having multiple players going after the same chef can be detrimental to the ones who miss out. Overall lots of fun, especially at 2 players. Can sometimes run a little long though.

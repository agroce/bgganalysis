RATING: 6
A bidding game, with an interesting mechanic: you have to ring a bell when you are satisfied with what is put up for an auction.  I always wait too long or slam the bell too soon.  Either way I loose.

Great game for families.  It's a bit like Coloretto and a game of chicken put together - with a few twists.  My boys both love it and the bell adds a lot of fun.  It has also worked really nicely as a filler in between more serious games with some of the game groups I'm in.

I have recently raised this from a 7 to an 8.  Quite simply my boys can't get enough of it and it is great fun!

Nice novelty of a bell at first but after two plays it seemed far too luck dependant and quite vicious with the spoiling rules (someone - i.e. always me when I had the chance - just grabs one fish and sells it to spoil several other players)

: 5인은 파티게임, 4인은 좀더 전략적인 게임(5인은 예측 힘듬).

요즘 부인님이 10점만점 주는 게임. 으잉?

치열하지도 않고, 떠들썩하지도 않는 매우 가벼운 게임이면서 어려운 게임느낌을 준다.(메뉴얼은 기프트 트랩처럼 A4 1장) 보스와 같은 기대를 해서 방출대상이었는데, 사람에따라 느낌도 다르고 아무나 해도 괜찮은 게임인듯 싶다.

5명까지 되는 게임. 넉넉잡아 최대 1시간.
(카드 떨어지면 끝이라 1시간 이상 할수 없다.)

부인 왈, 쑥스러운 사람이 용기낼 수 있는 게임이란다.

Auction game with a bell! Fun little game, you've got to think quickly to decide whether the catch is worth £10 and so ring the bell. On my first game, I think each of us would have done better by never bidding, so plenty to learn about the strategy.

RATING: 6.5
Nice idea - fixed bid for variable goods (fish).  I think one less fish type might have helped, making more things interesting.  The player who taught us introduced a house rule that says if ten cards are turned over the dealer must acquire these - otherwise the game just fizzles out.  Maybe that perceived problem is fixed by the scoring?  Second and subsequent games with non-gamers however much more successful and most have enjoyed.

A good little filler from Queen, in the usual oversized box (bah!). An auction game with an odd reverse mechanic. First one to hit the bell claims the cards, but pays a straight €10 however many are there.

Jan 2011:  Down to a 7.  For some reason my group has turned on this one after a couple of so-so experiences.  I think the problem was we were playing with too many players.  Perhaps this is a game that requires 3 or 4 to shine.

I can see that you wouldn't want to over-play this one, but as a light-to-medium-weight with a nice but not overbearing dutch auction speed element, I liked this quite a bit. It actually seemed to work better and be a bit better calibrated than the classic Merchants of Amsterdam, although the latter is still probably the more nuanced and interesting game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
An auction game where you flip over cards until someone decides its worth their while to take them and smacks the bell.  It's really kind of a push your luck game, as the longer you wait to buy, the bigger risk there is of either someone else smacking the bell before you, or some crappy fish turning up that you didn't really want.  However, sometimes waiting a little longer might get you a sweeter pot.  Overall, nothing too exciting, but there is opportunity for a little screwage and the randomness of the cards keeps things uncertain.  I normally wouldn't play a game like this, but it's short enough to be a decent filler.

A bit of a lark but I'm not convinced that there is enough happening to make me want to play again and again. It's kind of like Bohnanzay Coloretto meets Pit: a real-time push-your-luck simultaneous play auction economic game. Trouble was the real time element meant it comes down to a lot of guess work and playing chicken with your opponents. Plus if you removed the real time element I don't think you would be left with something worth playing.

Simple rules which turn into an interesting game of calculating what the offer is worth to all players and decide whether it's time to take it or not. From the rules, you would expect a RA-like game, but it never gets this depth because it is based on being fast and the value of a lot varies even more between players then in RA. Overall I wouldn't mind playing again because it doesn't take too long and makes for some interesting decisions along the way.

This was introduced to me as a Pit/Coloretto hybrid and it is a good description of the game. It just doesn't work that well. There didn't seem to be any intensity over the auctions as most of the time they weren't worth the 10 euro flat cost.

RATING: 5.5
The auctioneer turns fish cards over one by one until another player bites and rings the bell in the centre of the table, meaning they win the fixed price auction. You want to wait to get more fish for your money, but wait too long and someone else grabs the haul. 

This is the essence of the game. The fish you buy are collected in sets but you can only have three types on the go at any one time, so if you have more than three types of fish the others go in the trash. Add a little bite with stealing others fish and the like and you have a quick and fun family game. 

The bell in the centre of the table is the main point of difference here. It is that mechanic which makes this a fun game – as more and more fish come out who will strike the bell first?

A nice, light, realtime dutch auction game. Lots always cost the same amount of money but continue to grow until one player hits the bell. You need to be quick to evaluate the value of the fish on offer or they will already be gone which is certainly not for everyone. It does work well as a short filler, though, and the thematic integration is exceptional.

I played once and enjoyed it, but it's a little more fragile than some other auction games. Money is TIGHT and doesn't enter the game often, so players have to be very careful in the auctions they win in order to better their position. Also, the fish thief card is a little more take-that than I like. (I think the threat of spoiling fish is a good enough spur to not hold on too long.) I wanted to like this one more than I did.

I liked it.  It's like a blend between Coloretto and Ra, though faster than either -- you want lots of three types of fish at once, avoiding others, but fish are acquired by adding them one-by-one to a stack until someone likes it enough to ring the bell and buy the whole stack.  Recommendation: make sure that you clearly establish the rules for resolving who "wins" an auction before starting, because there WILL be conflicts.

This is a fun game that veeery closely matches how things are done at the Hamburger Hafen. And if you throw some character play into this, yelling your offers, man does it become fun.

So all it is is making money from selling fish. Just like in Hamburg. But it ain't so easy. Sales of other people are making your own fish go bad. So you want a lot of any kind of fish, but also be making money. But you also need to spend money to get fish. Man, sometimes it feels like trying to hold on to a fish, because the money feels slippery going out of your hand the minute you got it. 

Fun little game. With a bell to boot. Fun choices, nice cards and great atmosphere even if you think it might sound fishy.  ;)

Halkusz: Halakat kell árverésen szereznünk, eltárolnunk, majd eladnunk. A kikiáltónak van lehetősége a halait eladni. Több fajtát is adhat el, de ha elad valamit, akkor az összeset el kell, természetesen minél többet ad el, annál többet kap. Ezután elkezdi felcsapni a halkártyákat. A játékosok amikor úgy érzik szeretnék elvenni az összeset rácsapnak a csengőre. Ezt követően el kell tárolnunk a halakat,amelyet nem sikerül az megromlott és ki kell dobni. Természetesen ez utóbbiak mínusz pontot érnek. A speciális haltolvajjal másik játékostól tudunk halat elvenni, illetve a konzervhallal ki tudunk két halat dobni a kukánkból.

Surprisingly well received by my kids, even those who aren't gamers, and enough strategy to keep me interested.  It's definitely light, but there's room for calculation, together with the fun of screwing up those calculations under the time pressure of the fish sale.  My only complaint is that the "Krebs" card shows what looks like a crab but Queen translates as "crawfish."

A fun, light auctioning game. My 5-year-old just wants to bid on 1 or 2 cards, which makes it hard to (1) earn much commission as auctioneer, and (2) get the fish you want unless she's auctioning and can't buy them. Generally we just end up waiting until she runs herself out of money, but she loves ringing the bell.

Without my 5-year-old in play, the game gets much more interesting, but I think it will still take a few more plays before I get the hang of making much of a profit.

Cash-a-Catch is a great way of drawing in folks into auction-style games.  While there's no fluctuation in purchase price (10 bucks being the price for one or ten fish, or anywhere inbetween), it teaches players how a market works.  Paying $10 may seem like a bad move when purchasing one fish however, if that gives you ten total you'll be able to sell them all for $30.  Being able to weigh out when the right times to make the right purchases is key in this one.  We really had a good time with this one and recommend it.

I'm too slow for this game. My girlfriend destroys me and has won three out of our first four games by a large margin. In the moment I made up my mind that there's enough fish to hit the bell the fish was already gone. The alternative to just hit the bell with the third fish card showing up didn't work out either. Too many rotten fish of diverse types was the result. If you're good at speed games like Ligretto (Dutch Blitz) this should do it for you as well. Even if you suck at speed games, the theme and the short duration of 30 minutes makes it acceptable to play. And if it is for nothing else than spoiling other people's fish when selling your own.

A fun little game which should be approached as really only a light filler.  It feels a little like It's Mine in the auction part, then simple set collection with a nice timing/spoiling mechanism.  The artwork is very nice and really improves the game, as does the bell.  Someone expecting a deep strategy game will be disappointed, but if you're looking for a quick, silly, yet not mindless, fishmongering experience, this fits the bill.

Update: This is probably our fault, but I've been experiencing severe runaway leader problems.  The last few games have not been very fun.  Down to a 6.

Fairly average auction game. Players attempt to collect sets of fishes and sell them. The unique thing here is the hotel-service bell, which players ring to signal they want to buy cards. Its a bit too loud and doesn't always work (unless you hit it squarely). Probably only best played with non-gamers.

Game didn't really work for me.  If you like to think about your decisions, this is not the game for you.

Think it's too gamey for the kids but too chaotic and light for gamers, which means it will never get played.

Bought from Essen 2007. Light but tight "bidding game" (well, you don't actually make any bids - but there is similar element) which one uses Halli-Galli bell. Nothing special or new here, but is well made.

RATING: 6
The reverse fixed price mechanic makes it hard for people to calculate when to buy in. The number of fish types means that by the time the batch is profitable there will be waste. Those combine to make it more about not getting behind than about getting ahead.

Auction game using some elements of Coloretto with some special cards and a really annoying bell. Stupid name for the English version. Not for me...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Auction game where one person flips fish cards over until one of the other players ring the bell.  The fish always cost the same but they then must be placed onto their storage.  There's only room for 3 different types of fish.  Instead of auctioning a player can also sell fish.  The more fish you have of one type the higher your sell price.  There are special cards which let you steal fish and when you sell fish, that type in another players storage will rot some unless they have it on ice.  

I've only played once but we noticed that the two leaders in the game were running away with it.  They always had more money to invest and would continually invest often.  Might be a problem with the game but hopefully just something everyone needs to understand before the game starts.

Set-collection, screwage (slight), press-your-luck and some economic timing decisions.  All-in-all something I'd like to try again hoping to see a gem of a game.

As with many real-time games, expect that a pound of flesh may be offered to the shared implement, in this case the bell players must quickly ring to begin collecting their sets. The rest of the game is simple euro-style auction suit-collecting fare that holds up once the novelty of the gimmick wears off.

Liked it, and even better, the girlf liked it! We were all a bit trigger-happy (or bell-happy, more accurately) but if we'd let each auction go a bit longer, and done our maths better, we all would have made some money. As it was, two of us made €1 and €2 respectively, despite one trading way more than the other, one of us lost €7, and the other traded very little and made a €24 profit!
Edit: 2nd game I made a €44 profit! Will be even better once everyone is used to it, and doesn't close bidding too early.

Nothing extraordinary here.  There may be some rich-get-richer problems as the players that do well early have more flexibility as the game goes on.

RATING: 7
Appropriate both for gamers and non-gamers, Fangfrisch is a cheerful, light inversion of an auction game (a increasing lot of fish is snatched by the first player to pay a fixed bid, and the auctioneer gets some bonus for the amount of sold cards) crossed with M or Coloretto (only three sorts of fish can be stored separately for later sale, one of them in ice so it doesn't spoil, while the rest go to the bin and bring penalty). More tactical palates will enjoy the economic element underneath the glee of yelling and ringing the bell: the winner is the player who makes the most money out of selling their sorted fish (the more fish sold at once, the more benefit). The game is over relatively quickly, and can be played a couple of times in a row.

There are just two issues with this otherwise charming game... first, being short of money is a tough situation to overcome and it's very probable that players lose money at the end of a game, since fish have got to be sold at least in bundles of four to make any profit - this unfortunately encourages players to do nothing and just wait for an auction where the right couple of cards start. This leads to the second issue: what happens when the auctioneer auctions the whole pile because nobody else wants to buy? The market closes and people sell their fish at half the price, but is it worth snatching the lot just before the market closes if more than half of such an enormous amount of fish has got to land on the rubbish?

What you get when you cross the card taking of It's Mine with the sale rules of Hansa. The mechanic in It's Mine works because it's 5-10 mins of fun. 30 mins is stretching it all too far. Fine for an occasional play maybe, but no desire to buy or replay really.

It's a race to see who can smack the bell first, but don't get too anxious cause you'll make a bad deal for yourself.  The hook is the bell, but there's also a nice set collecting game built around it.  Needs to be played fast.  Lots of fun, but not to be taken too seriously.  Rating after one play.

Almost Bohnanza like feel in collecting limited portfolio set to then trade in for money. Alittle fiddly, with money transactions and sorting creating a hiccup in gameflow. I feel Queen games missed out on a marketing opportunity of using the latest advances in scratch & sniff technology. Unfortunately, the noisy bell was omitted in both games, which I feel subtracts some of the fun out of the session.

All auctions cost 10 and cards are added until you pull the trigger. I would put that is more of a push you luck element - where bad cards could be added and somebody else jump in. 
Once you have the cards you collect in 3 buckets until your turn to sell. 
Has couple of levels of competition - for the cards and when you sell you can force discards on other players (for negative points).
The game just seems to miss.

Bid for fish cards at a fixed price. The bigger the catch grows, the more the auctioneer will earn. Sell sets of fish to earn money. Too many fish to store & some will go-off costing your money at the end. The richest player wins.

Frantic ring the bell auction style is not for everyone, but this is ok harmless fun (unless you clash hands in the bell-ringing frenzy!).

And interesting auction/bidding game, but likely too much luck and a bit of a runaway leader issue to be a great game.  I ended up with the same score in both games, and the second game, I didn't buy anything (only receiving money from flipping cards).

--Jul2011-- Son #2's game.  It's an amusing mix of a random card stream and a set of chaotic decisions in the players' decisions to ring the bell and end an auction.  Outside that, the decisions of when to sell and what container in which to place one's fish are nearly trivial.  Still, it's a fun light amusement.  (Despite the lack of dice or trading, my children declared it similar to both _Can't Stop_ and _Bohnanza_.)

A nice looking game where players are fish mongers who buy fishes from the fishers? trying to collect sets of certain fishes. Then they sell their fishes for more money. The buying is done by each players auctioning a 'catch' in their turn by turning cards one by one on the table. When somebody else wants to buy the catch they have to push a bell in the middle of the table before anyone else. Each catch has the same set price (10 euros).

Amusing bell-mashing game of judgement and timing. Includes eels. The system is actually very subtle and deep, I think. Like Bohnanza, regular play should lead to revelations about game theory and mathematics. Ultimately, Bohnanza does the same thing better, so there's not much room for this game.

I love the way the mechanics interrelate here, from the fast-paced, bell-ringing auctions to the spoilage factor to the way the market for selling works.  About the only thing I would change is allowing the auctioneer to bid too, a la Modern Art.   I like the idea of an economic game with a speed mechanic.  Update:  played with five and it doesn't seem to work well.  Just too many cooks.

Since there are always auctions occurring, it will keep players on their toes. The bell can be easily broken though which is a huge issue since everyone in the game will be slamming against it. The money provided is very hard to handle (way too small!). The game does not really offer much variety so playing it repeatedly will make it lose its "fun" factor extremely fast. Amount of times played should be spread out over a long time-span.

Actually an excellent game despite looking simplistic. Gamers and non-gamers play well together - the gamers can make decisions about relative value of fish to each player, and when to buy for good value or to deprive an opponent. Non-gamers have fun buying and ringing the bell! As much or as little thought as you want and no analysis paralysis even for those thinking the most - you snooze, you lose the auctions.

This game is severely underrated! Yes. A light game but nonetheless a highly interactive game. I would put it in the same class as Bohnanza but even more interactive than that. Not to be played with folks that enjoy only ASL or Descent. But more of a family/casual gaming group. HOWEVER, this game can be really really brutal.... as we played it, spoiled fish can cause lots and lots of agony. In fact, I ended up with negative cash at the end of one session. More than meets the eye in terms of screwage. Twice I have played this game and in both occasions, lots of laughs, quick hand movement and outrageous bidding. Highly recommended as party game or great filler.

This game works well in casual and non-gamer groups. I think that it might have a bit of trouble in groups where the players are physically awkward or stuffy in nature. Once you figure out what things are worth your choices are fairly simple, however you do have to keep your eyes on several factors so it keeps your mind engaged. It moves at a fairly brisk pace and the bell keeps a good tension. You will hear laughter when playing which is always a good sign. I will say as is par for the coarse with Queens games, the rules are a bit vague on some points. Over all a great light fun game and very under rated here on the geek.

Speed maths and bell ringing. This game features a fix priced auction where the lot gets increasingly bigger, but some of the fish for sale are going to be worth negative points for some players. You can try to calculate what it's worth to you as the auction goes on, but you'd have to be quick about it because the first person to ring the bell gets the lot. So over-analytical players lose out to those who go with their gut. Usually, I'd approve of that, as I prefer to play games swiftly by hunch and feeling than succumb to AP and drag things out for everyone. However, this game didn't quite work for my group. There's a large luck element to it. It's possible to do well by never bidding: a dull strategy. Maybe it works as a light family game?

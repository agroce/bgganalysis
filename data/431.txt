This is a great strategic filler. I used to think it was a sexist game but finally a chick won and my boyfriend didn't! Easy to pull this out and teach only issue I have is the blue and green currency on the building board can be a little confusing. The symbols should have been more unique.

The special rules for two players are welcome. It would have been nice if the colors used for currency weren't reused for the buildings. Fine game but I'll stick with Stimmt So.

Okay, this is another one of those games that really isn't a 10 - certainly not a perfect 10.  For gameplay, it's maybe a 7 or 8... but I simply ADORE this game.  And fortunately for me, so do a few others I play with.  We'll often play it twice in a row.  One time me, my friend Bob, and Bob's mother played FIVE games of this, one right after another... heaven!  I think it's especially good for three, by the way.  Also, I haven't played Alhambra yet, but, as you can guess, I don't think the "original" needs anything added to it :)

*** MANY PLAYS LATER ***

I have played Alhambra now (a few times, even) and wow, do I prefer Stimmt So!  I am, sadly, in the minority on this one. [See: Alhambra for why I like this one better]

The game that Alhambra built itself on. It's the same game without the tile laying and palace building aspect.  A solid yet rather uninspiring set collection game with no fluff. 

I prefer the New York version of this, which I also own, as it offers a slightly different theme to Alhambra.

Played once with six and once with five players. 

The first time was with the rules as written, and it will be the only time we play that way. From now on, I will use the rule from [i][gameid=6249][/i] which allows you to pick either one money card or more than one as long as the total is five or less. It stops the game from dragging because there is only one money card anyone wants to take.

Otherwise, it is a nice, streamlined version of [i]Alhambra[/i]. My one complaint with the graphic design is the stock cards can be hard to differentiate across the table.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The strategy of buying only things that you can purchase by exact change is too strong, imho. Alhambra "fixes" this, by creating a spacial aspect, so not all "stocks' are playable.

New York Card Game:  Very much like the parent game except there isn't any tile laying, just majorities.  I liked it.  Good quality, great graphics. This will get played again.

Not bad, not great. Basically a card game packaged as a board game, and luck plays it role,. The theme is a bit odd with Auntie Emma trying to buy up the stock market, and you're all her reps or something. But the mechanic is quite nice, it's an easy game to teach most anyone quickly and entertaining enough.

Fun, albeit chaotic, share speculation game.  Players on their turn draft a bank note in one of four currencies, or spend their currencies for one of the four available shares on offer.  If they pay the exact amount (they can overspend) then they may continue purchasing.  Good old Wertung cards pop up to pay victory points for share majorities at three points in the game.  Good fun.

Meh. What a pile of crap. The math is all kinds of broken in this game. One player gets lucky and flips the correct building to buy, so they are one card ahead of someone else in a color, but they get vastly more points. This game might just be unfinished, and could use another couple of balance passes. Maybe it was good in 1992... but probably not.

El juego es sencillo pero divertido, es un juego de mayoría con mucha táctica y algo de azar. No es un juego sesudo, es un juego para jugarlo tomando un café por la mañana o un cerveza tranquilamente. Lo jugué a 2 quitando modificando algunas reglas; eliminamos 1 carta de dinero de cada tipo (como dice el reglamento) y no utilizamos el jugador virtual. El juego lo terminamos cuando se acaba el mazo de dinero en lugar del mazo de construcción, quedó mucho mejor que con el engorroso jugador virtual y en pocas palabras los edificios que quedan son los de dicho jugador virtual solo que sin estar tomando cartas.

Very, very simple, light, luck-based, but still great fun. A bit over-packaged, if you can get this cheaply, do so. It could be improved by colouring the share cards to make it more obvious, and the mechanism is very similar to Union Pacific (majority scoring, random scoring). But a must-buy game.

This is the card version of Alhambra which plays similar to the original tile version but plays quicker. Instead of tiles, you collect cards. 

There are no walls. The rules of play remains exactly the same as the original.

Lower rating as you lose the tile laying game feel. However, this game plays much quicker than the original tile laying verison.

While I like Alhambra, I don’t want to play the accompanying card game again. While the luck of getting the exact denomination to buy a tile can be annoying in the original, there are enough other decisions involved in planning the Alhambra to mitigate the luck. The card game lacks this balancing, the cards will always ‘fit’, no wall bonuses can compensate the majorities. With two players, things are even worse as the neutral player Dirk randomly gets cards making the majority scoring a complete crapshoot. Never again at this player count!

I understand that this is basically a rethemed Stimmt So!, which I should have tried first.  I think I've given a fair number of plays to Alhambra, and have even tried most of the expansions.  But it's taken the card game to show me that I'm looking for is actually the opposite of an expansion.  The walls and placement rules are generally a nuisance, and the speedier play makes the game just feel right.  Alhambra always felt a little long for what it was, and this feels like it restores what should have been.

In a way it feels very similar to Get the Goods, which I also like, but I like the different currencies used in this game.  I guess they both have their place.

There was once a game called Al Capone which was a card game released by a small self publishing company called db spiele. It was worth every penny I paid for it and was a hit among all game groups that I took it to. Then came Alhambra by Queens which transposed some of the mechanics of Al Capone onto tiles and added the mechanic of tessalating those tiles; to the few of us that played Al Capone Alhambra was not an advancement or even a better game. Now many years down the line after a number of Alhambra expansions (not all were enhancements I can assure you) and the release of the dice game comes yet another variant on a theme, Alhambra the card game. However closer examination reveals it to at long last be a slightly rethemed release of the original game Al Capone. It is an excellent game, and the only (minor) rule changes they have made have been for the better. My advice if you can get only one of the Alhambras get this one, and if you jave more than one verson, make sure this is one of them.

Having played Alhambra, I had an idea how the card game might play.  I was exactly right!  Even though it was predictable in its mechanics, I still enjoyed it.  A nice, light game without too much brain strain.  Only complaint was why they couldn't put a replica scoring board like from Alhambra.  I didn't feel like pen and paper so I borrowed the scoring board from the Big Box and it was perfect.  Maybe I'm just annoyed I paid $29.99 for it when it seems like the contents didn't justify that high a price.  My fault for an impulse buy.

I guess I shouldn't have been surprised but this card game is essentailly the original game with the tiles and wall mechanic stripped out. This essentially reduces the game to a set collection card game, which is still ok and it does help players learn the importance of paying exact amounts to earn a bonus action.

As such this is good as a teaching tool to the original game or for groups that prefer card games and don't want the complication of the walls and tiles.

Game where players have one action to buy stock, or pick up 1 of 4 available currency cards. If you can pay exact cash for a stock, gain another action. Victory points are awarded on majority of stock. It's not a bad game, the hiccup in the game was when the 4 available cards were $1, then if a player picked one up, it maybe replaced by a  high valued card (eg a $9 card), benefiting the next player, making it a luck fest. I'll still play it, but it's light and decisions are easy. Alhambra is the improved version of this game.

Pretty good card draft game which I like it better than Alhambra. As someone already said, emphasis is on the right place which is about getting majority on various stocks. A variant with starting 20 or more money and allowing for player to pick up many cards with the total value of 5 or less makes game a lot better. I tried this with 3, 5 and 6 players and definitely better with 3.

Bad thing is that a lot of stocks have similar graphics and components are too big for what it is.

The game is good, but not as good as Dirk Henn&#039;s excellent Showmanager.  It is a very light game, with most choices being fairly obvious, but it is still a fun game.  Although it plays with 6, the game is a bit too long and random with that many.  Best with 4-5 players.

A Arábia ficou conhecida, entre outras coisas, pela sua arquitetura. Deve ter sido daí que surgiu a ideia do Alhambra, em que jogadores disputam dinheiros (de quatro tipos diferentes, todos em referência a moedas antigas) e prédios de vários tipos. Aí, de tempos em tempos, quem tem mais prédios daquele tipo pontua. Ok, mas esse é o Alhambra original. Essa versão aí é o Alhambra Cardgame, muito parecido, mas com a diferença de não ter os bônus dados por muros consecutivos do original. Nada que prejudique a diversão. Simples o suficiente para não confundir novatos.

I liked this one. Take the card majorities and scoring system from Union Pacific, acquire the cards through money you collect, add in the neat 'go again if you can pay exact' feature, and there's enough decision making in this to keep it interesting ... but with rampant luck in what money you're able to collect when and in what cards you are able to purchase when, hopefully before you lose your majority!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice card game that's playable by up to 6 (always good) for 40 mins or so that moves fast. It's Alhambra rule for rule - 4 currencies, 6 building colours, 4 money cards out to pick up, 4 building cards out to buy, one in each ccy - except that the buildings you buy across the 6 colours are just placed in front of you in sets and whoever has the most cards in each colour scores it when the scoring cards come up at the 2/5, 4/5 and end game scorings (which is also set up the same way and scores the same points as Alhambra). As a result, it moves fast, its easy to teach, it's pleasant to play without being taxing. All the usual luck is there in what comes up and how many times you'll feel 'forced' to pay over instead of being able to pay exact and get an extra turn. But that decision is the essence of Alhambra, and it's provided here as well. This has always seemed like a no-brainer of a card game to release really.

Accidentally bought the wrong version of the game, so it was a bit of a letdown.  Actually gave this another try, and found it wasn't so bad as I first thought.  Enjoyed it well enough, it just was not the game I had meant to buy (I meant to buy the tile building game, but they don't play that much differently and this one is more compact).  Raising my rating of this as it really is not a bad game.

A majority share-holding card game in which payouts are triggered by the exciting wertung (scoring) cards hidden in the money deck.

But there are a couple of hurdles diluting the excitement: the distribution and the values of the shares are wonky so unless you are familiar with the shares you may be at a loss as to which money/share cards to draft.

The other issue is the difficulty in tracking the cash flow of fixed values which does promote tense uncertainty as to whether to pull the trigger and pay more for a share or wait and pay exact to gain the kicker of extra drafts in your turn. This last feature  (and drafting more than one money card if value is less than 5)introduces a pacing decision to slow or speed up the replenishments to get the wertungs out in your favour.

So it is a shame this will have to go as one attraction was getting to know the different buildings in the Netherlands but such info wasn't part of the game nor did the buildings add any theme.

Sadly for this style of game I'm leaning towards Airlines as the shares are 1 value and distribution is printed on each share; and if I remember rightly money held is not secret. 

However I'm not a fan of majority holdings as the cross-referencing to work out 1st and 2nd place (or ties) is alittle bit of a chore.

Nice mix of trying to balance getting more resources to purchase later or purchase now.  Little to do while others play but count cards and see where they end up.  Advantage over Alhambra is that the game plays quickly as there is only single choice (get money or get stocks).  Alhambra can slow a bit as folks consider their tile placement.  So not much down time between turns as turns should proceed quickly.

Nem tudtam, hogy a kártyajáték volt előbb és utána fejlesztették ki a lapkás változatot. Csak annyi az eltérés a lapkáshoz képest, hogy itt nincs fal, csak sorban gyűjtjük az épületeket színek szerint. Minden más teljesen megegyezik az alapjátékkal. Így én is azok táborát erősítem, akik szerint semmi szükség, hogy mindkét játék meglegyen egy gyűjteményben a fanatikusokon kívül. A falak hiánya és az építkezés izgalma miatt talán az alapjáték a jobb, de aki a könyedebb verziót szeretné magának tudni jól jár ezzel a játékkal.

Pretty much the same as Alhambra, without the topological exercise of placing your tiles optimally in your own grid. That does make it more suitable for younger children, though. But you can simply play Alhambra itself that way, so there's no reason to own this (apart from the pictures of Dutch places of interest, which were the theme of the vesion I played).

Came with my kickstarter order that was mis packaged and everyone ordered a big box and got family edition... I'm giving queen a chance to win me over, but not a great first impression.

As a reasonably quick super-filler, A:TCG has really grown on me. It took a handful of plays before I was actually playing with all the correct rules, but still :P

The Alhambra scoring mechanism has always felt a little strange to me, but the combination of random money + random buildings seems to all shake out in the wash. I like how buying with exact change allows for an additional action and helps incentivize taking low value money cards.

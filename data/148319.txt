Provisional rating after one play. Heavy deduction game for Eurogamers in so far as it's light on storytelling and heavy on puzzle-y mechanics. Very much enjoyed it but replayability will be lacking due to scenario-based play.

Impossible to explain, and mind-bending to learn, Tragedy Looper is an amazing game.

Some of the translations are confusing, and I'm not sure it's entirely well balanced, but you have to give it credit for striking into uncharted territory.

Cooperative deduction game. Not exactly two of my favourite things in board games. But this one has an interesting and satisfying dynamic of playing against and trying to outwit one player. 

Too much reading of player aids/sheets removes me from immersion in the setting. This may be mitigated by more plays I suppose. Strangely, this doesn't bother me in solo games or war games but does in coops.

RATING: 8.5
Logic/deduction game with bluffing and hidden actions.  This game completes me.

It's a gigantic maze of bluffing, logical deduction, and cat and mouse, with tons of misdirection and ample opportunity for great plays or even dumb luck.

The only downside is that it's very difficult to get to the table, and in order to fully appreciate it you need to play it regularly with the same group (else others will fall prey to easy traps).

The length of play (2-3 hours) and the downsides to non-regular play make it a really tough sell to new players, but I still really like it.

1st play: Mind..Blown.. I was not sure how this would play out, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. Very interesting deductive gameplay, with some reveal moments and a minor storyline to go with it. I look forward to playing again with additional subplots.

2nd play: absolutely failed as the mastermind. The game is much harder than I thought. Whether the game is worth the effort remains to be seen. This game is tough to rate and such a unique experience

I'm sold! It's so mysterious, not really knowing what to do, but at the same time deducing the hell out of it. The only thing that bogs me a little is the artwork, which I'm not really a fan of (and maybe the reference sheet is too text-based...)

My mind is completely blown by this game.  Someone managed to make a time travel game that works well, is amazing, and is very thematic.  Every game is like a murder mystery exploration experience, in which you keep finding new ways for things to go terribly wrong, but then you loop back in time to the start and you play again, this time you must avoid having the bad event occur.

Fun deduction game, but a little titchy.  I feel like some of the scenarios in the box are half-baked, and the "first steps" scenarios are not great.   I feel like the right custom scenarios would really elevate this, but since scenarios are impossible to replay it's very hard to find a "just right" one to play.  Hard to get to the table, since you have to use a scenario that no one else has played before (except the mastermind) meaning that you can't really bring on your friend who has never played before with people who have.

It took me about six playthroughs before everything finally clicked for me. I was completely confused (the first time my wife and I played it we spent over three hours. It wasn't fun and we realized we were probably playing it wrong. But we heard so much good about it we kept playing).  Now I can teach it to a new group easily and they understand and love it by the end of their first game. This is now one of my favorite games. If you like Clue but want something like "Clue on Steroids" then this game is for you. I doubt it will take you as many times as it took me to play before I understood - I'm uncomfortably slow at times - and it is so much fun. Definitely check it out!

I like deduction games.  This is a humdinger of a deduction game, with the protagonists placed in a situation where they know only that a tragedy needs to be prevented from happening.  They need to figure out the what, where and who of that tragedy as well as which sub plots are in operation and the secret roles of several of the characters involved.  The ways in which an evil mastermind manipulates the characters help to fill in the blanks.  For the mastermind player the game is a tough balancing act between doing enough to ensure that the protagonists lose, while not providing too many clues.  The number of levers available to pull can be a little overwhelming.

I like time travel as a theme.  In Tragedy Looper it is just a conceit that allows the game to be reset, giving the protagonists several attempts to solve the mystery and avoid defeat.  Nonetheless this works well.  

Manga I can take or leave.  Tragedy Looper shows good fidelity to its genre in its artwork, character abilities and narrative concerns. 

Tragedy Looper is a challenging game of deduction, bluff, mis-direction and concealment.  My one reservation is that this isn't a game I feel I can play straight off the shelf.  Get past the learning scenarios and the evil mastermind needs some preparation time to understand the significance of various elements in play and to plan their strategy.

Production quality is reasonable, except for the player aids that are just glossy paper.  The artwork on the player cards is nicely done, elsewhere there is a surfeit of dark colours on dark backgrounds. On first reading I found the rules quite difficult to take in.

Don't really know how to rate this game. I like the deductive logic elements of it, but I feel like it would almost be better as a two player game; I got tired of trying to explain what we knew and why we knew it to my exasperated teammate(s).

WOW! This is so different. So much going on, thematic and and tense! I'm not really sure how to describe this without giving away too much. Just play it.

After a second game and a new scenario it is even better! There is so much going on and the shared puzzle element really works with lots of discussion. The mastermind also has a complex game to play. 

The rules to this are actually very simple. The thing that makes it complex and rich is the "spreadsheet" (don't let that word put you off) where all the information is laid out for you and it is great fun trying to deduce what is going on.

Though the anime theme, game length and complexity for new players ensures this will not get played very often, Tragedy Looper is a pretty unique deduction game, one of the most unique I've ever seen.

I love deduction games -- and this would be a 10, except that there is no 'story' to start of each scenario.  I get it that we're popping in 'Quantum Leap' style and so we don't know what is going on, but at least *some* set-up text seems vital to getting everyone into the theme of the game, no?

RATING: 4
Too inaccessible for me. Game play reminded me of Le Fantôme de l’Opéra in so far as players use cards to try to control non-player characters on the board, each having different abilities and one player knowing some secret information. But there the similarity ends. I sold Le Fantôme because although it has the advantage of being easy to teach, I thought it lacked depth. Tragedy Looper has depth, and I sank in it. Two plays in and I still don't get it. When I was told “The killer might not be the murderer, the murderer might not be the killer” I knew this was slipping away from me.

Love this game. One (evil Mastermind) vs many in co-op (Protagonists). The protagonists have to deduce what is going on - and they start off knowing nothing. Not a clue what is happen. They wander around and  loop ends, they lose.

So then they have another shot at it. Better stop that happening again, so what if ..  loop ends, they lose!

Awesome tension. Mastermind has too much to get done - build red herrings, bluff, as well as achieve their plans. Protagonists are trying to remove possibilities and find out what is going on.

Very dependent on the Mastermind and their awareness of the game.

Game is 100% deduction. Break down all the info you have gained, piece together the story, then try and prevent it from happening again. I think it's brilliant and can't wait to play through every scenario. 

The problem: Most of the people I play with aren't all in on a 100% deduction game. I'm not sure that I'll be able to convenience them to play through the entire game with me. Also, each scenario is cooked after each play, but it looks like it will support a lot of additional material, I hope it takes off.

Really unique system, combines elements of Werewolf, Dracula/Scotland Yard, Mr. Jack, and throws a time loop element on top.  Really interesting to tell/be told that you've lost on multiple occasions and continue the play.

One downside is that sometimes the ultimate failure comes and the protagonists still haven't quite figured out what is going on, yet they can never try this scenario again, you just kind of reveal everything and that's the end of it.  In those cases it might be best to just play through one more loop just to give them another chance to figure everything out.

This game is not within my wheelhouse of favorite things. I'm indifferent on the Anime theme and I'm not really into co-ops, but I came with an open mind when asked to play this deduction game. The results were mediocre at best. 

It doesn't help that the rules get in the way and that there's a ludicrous amount of hidden information available to solve the puzzle. The player aid that came with the game was just obfuscated with the amount of minutiae. It seemed that it was a crapshoot guessing game in the hopes of getting the right info that you need. 

The time looping mechanism was an interesting idea and mixing a social game with a deduction element was promising, but in the end the game is just a repetitive tit-for-tat ping pong match.

This is a real brain burner for the mastermind entering a new script for the 1st time. It takes me several games to memorize the character and its hidden roles respectively. Even though the protagonists have figured out the roles, it's still exciting and challenging of the duel between the mastermind and the protagonists. A simple game at its core but indeed with a lot of potential.

I find it unexciting to play brain burners like Tragedy Looper, as all you can do all over the time is think, wait, think again, take a single action and then wait again: no enthusiasm whatsoever when playing it, only deduction and analysis paralysis brought to the extreme.

And the Japanese cartoonish art surely doesn’t help make it any more enjoyable.

Initial Impressions:
---------------------
Man this one is a really unique deduction game, however it is also a lot of work to "get it" (and not screw up the whole "Tragedy").  Our first game was a mess, as I screwed up a few things as the master mind during the intro scenario.  The 2nd game went smooth once we all got it.  The game does have the flaw that if you have played a scenario before, you have no choice but to be the mastermind, but you can make new scenarios easily, so this isn't a huge issue.  I am VERY excited to get in more plays of this one, especially with more challenging scenarios.

Players face off against a Mastermind who's trying to cause chaos of various forms. If the Mastermind succeeds time loops and the other players get another chance to win.

A real bear to teach, but for people who can stick with you through the teaching phase, there is an utterly amazing game here. There is one of my all time favourite cadences - when the power shifts from the mastermind to the investigators, there is a distinct moment that everyone around the table feels. Then the whole game changes, to a bluff/counterbluff or cat and mouse battle of wits. Truly original, truly wonderful, but hard to find people to play with,

This is an engrossing, heavy game that's quirky. It doesn't quite play like anything else and you have to slog your way through the rules to get where it's going.

PROS: 
- No other game feels like this one!
- Once you get used to the mechanics, you really can see the story emerging within them
- Excellent deductive mystery-solving fun
- An incredible amount of variety -- every game really can offer an original scenario!

CONS:
- The art is SO dark! I'm not a fan of the anime, either
- The rulebooks are very long and unclear, with a hilariously inadequate explanation of the game's main thematic mechanic ("You can time travel for some reason. Maybe you found a magic object or something.")
- The player aid chart is a terrifying sight for new players

This is a pretty good game.  It is an amazing concept, and translates into a pretty good game.  It's another game where you really need to learn the game as a group, and have open conversation.  I feel I ran into the same problems learning this game that I did when learning Battlestar Galactica.  There is learning the mechanics of how the game plays and there is learning the under-arching strategy of the game and how it fits with the theme.  Although the rules state we shouldn't talk during the section we are playing the game we then ended with the new players not really knowing what we were doing.  We could have played the learning games while openly talking, so that later we could figure the game out ourselves...  It meant a game I should be rating a 9 is getting rated a 7.  It's pretty good.

Being the mastermind is terrifying. Great game. Components are awful, and a beast to try to teach the deduction element. I think part of that is it's originality, which is only proved by the fact that I've had equal success/frustration in teaching this to non-gamers and gamers alike. It's rare that such a unique game comes along.

Quick playing, brilliant deduction game. With a mastermind role with lots of potential for bluffing, double think, and long term strategy.

I also appreciate the viral aspect of the game. Once you've been a protagonist for a game, if you want to be mastermind for that same game, then you have to search out three new players to play with them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Based on 1 play with 4 players, as a Protagonist:

This is an interesting mix of deduction and bluffing. The deduction aspect is rock-solid and quite satisfying.

That said, contrary to what... well, everyone else seems to be saying about this game I'm not sure it will work those seeking a hardcore [i]pure[/i] deduction game. Because this is an adversarial game with one player as the villain there's this whole other element to the game. You have to solve the puzzle in order to win, but it's strange to play a deduction game where you don't immediately win upon doing so. Specifically, winning seems to be predicated on correctly guessing what your opponent (and sometimes your teammates) is going to do, and you don't necessarily have enough information to make it anything more than a guess. Responding to what your opponent is doing is pretty straightforward - the game is all in the bluff and mindgames here. It seems like many scenarios could boil down to "Okay it's the last turn and that card could be one of two things - if I correctly guess which one it is, I win."

Obviously it would be unfair for either side to have an informational advantage here... so I'm curious to see how often that happens and how it feels over repeated plays.

I like the time travel theme a lot - it's unique and plays into the mechanics well. But I can't decide whether or not I appreciate the cheesy stereotypical anime flavor. There's a ridiculousness (the flavor text on the back of the box made me laugh out loud) that permeates the whole thing that's uniquely fun, but I suspect if we were swimming in anime-style games I would not find it so amusing. I generally have conflicting feels on anime as a whole though.

I will say the game doesn't feel terribly thematic on the whole though. It's not exactly clear to me who anyone "is" in the story or what exactly they're doing to prevent the incidents from occurring - it's all very abstracted, which is maybe a necessity since the action cards, etc., need to work for a number of scenarios but I was surprised at just how abstract the game feels.

The learning game was not as bad as I expected it to be. The rules are actually much more straightforward than they sound (though the rulebook is plagued with infuriating verbosity), but it does take a few full rounds (if not the whole first game) to really wrap your head around the strategies. Just looking at the player aids can give you some pretty bad information overload, but I promise if you just relax and take things one step at a time it will all be okay.

Additionally, I wish the components had better separated function and flavor in some instances. For example, it would be better if the character cards had the art entirely separated from the instructional information, and that the action cards were smaller so that when you play them ontop of character cards they just cover up art and not the text you often need to see. There are a number of small things like this that don't feel super well thought out that increase the length of the learning game.

Quibbles aside, I had a really good time with this game and am super eager to play more! It seems like being the Mastermind would be a fun little bluffing puzzle too - almost Netrunner-like.

There's not really anything quite like it. Playing both sides is fun, even if the mastermind's options for victory are more limited than they first appear. Fun deduction, heavy dread, huge replay ability if you're willing to put the effort in. Shame there's a couple of little things dragging it down.

I'm just not sure how to feel about Tragedy Looper. Apparently it's "thematic". Well, I'm sure that a non-descript scenario with characters such as Boy Student and Office Worker and roles such as Key Person(!) is anything but. Intrigue, Paranoia, and Goodwill? Just needlessly fancy names for different HP tracks, and I find that playing cards in response to the mastermind is a bit too much to rock-paper-scissors for my liking, except determined beforehand and revealed later.

The game may have the most fascinating framing of a deduction game I've yet seen. But in my one play (as a Protagonist), while I found it extremely [i]engaging[/i], I found it only barely [i]fun[/i]. It may just not be my cup of tea. (Or perhaps I'd like it more if I played as Mastermind: with RPGs, I do tend to enjoy GMing more than playing.)

Having to watch what you say in front of the Mastermind is a really nice form of communication limitation for the Protagonists. (If you play with semi-limited communication: before Mastermind plays, but not afterwards.)

RATING: 6
Components: I'm not a fan of the Anime-style characters; the abilities on them are printed in too small font. The graphic design is overly busy, and too abstract. With the exception of the characters, the design reminds me of a blocky, 90s computer game. I'd like to see a redesigned version.

Experience: Overly complicated for what it delivers. Even with all the help from the rules, I've never felt so strategically adrift before. Same goes for the protagonists, who even with the “when in doubt, add goodwill” hint, found it very frustrating to lose on the first turn, before they had any clue what was happening. The protagonists get to make so few decisions, yet there is such complexity to the rules, and to their cheat sheet charts. As the mastermind, I was constantly having to hunt around in different places on the chart, to see what abilities were available to me. Meanwhile the protagonists were just sitting there, bored, waiting for me to make a move. My ineptitude as the mastermind meant the protagonists figured out the plots and roles early on, so it wasn't particularly interesting for them (the deduction part quickly gave way to just trying to out-maneuver me). All in all, a flop with my group. Too much effort for too few decisions.

Just the murder mystery game I've been looking for.
Scratches all the itches of deduction and outsmarting your opponent(s) at the same time!

A quick overview: It's 1 mastermind vs 3 protagonists. The mastermind knows what's going on and the hidden roles of each of the characters on the board. The protagonists have to find out who's who and try to avert the "tragedy" (or tragedies) that will occur. They can go back in time (reset the game) a number times depending on the script to go down a different path of deduction and that's where the game really shines. 

There are so many ways for the mastermind to mislead the protagonists and obscure the truth in this cat and mouse game. So if you like games where you have to be creative and outsmart your opponents or you like solving mysteries and logic puzzles, check this one out. You won't regret it.

RATING: 8
It's spiky.  It's fragile.  It's tough.  And yet there's nothing quite like it.

Tragedy Looper is very dependent upon getting the right people to play with you.  You almost need to approach it like a Legacy game -- teach a small group the rules, play the introductory scenario to make sure you understand them, and then come back to play it repeatedly until you're finished or bored.  This is not a game that rewards constantly switching players, and one disengaged person can really throw things out.

The graphic design is muddy, and the text can be difficult to read.  But whatever.  You're here for the deduction, and the deduction experience is second to none.  This is, in many ways, what I think TIME Stories wanted to be, but whereas TIME Stories shines from a storytelling perspective, it's deductive elements are weak.  Tragedy Looper is all about the deduction.

El "problema" principal que li veig és que has d'estar pendent d'unes taules de "trama", i quan estàs més pendent d'unes taules que de la partida en sí, "surto" una mica del tema.

It was my favorite time travelling game until I played T.I.M.E. Stories. OK, it's unfair to compare the two, I know. Tragedy Looper is a neat idea and I generally adore deduction games, but for some reason it din't click with me and my group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Played an English test version. I have to assume that there were translation issues, because the game was simply broken. It's a deduction game with a ludicrous amount of hidden information for its brief length. We played what was supposed to be the simple intro scenario, and the game was over in four turns with the detective players only able to make semi-random guesses at the hidden roles of six(!) different characters. They didn't even have a clue as to whether the deaths were murders or suicides.

The time-looping deduction is an interesting idea for sure, but this implementation is way more frustrating than fun.

RATING: 8
Don't let the anime artstyle put you off, this is a very strong competitive deduction game with original mechanics. The 10 included scenarios are well designed allowing for intense mindgames and clever deductions. You'll have a ton of fun piecing together clues with your friends or tricking them into a false route as the mastermind.  

As a game, I adore Tragedy Looper. However, the 
"script creation guide" puts TL over other games. This teaches players how to make their own scenarios, making for many, many more replays, and an fun game design challenge.

Great as a "main event" game, even better with the bonus that you can make your own. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Gets a bonus point for originality.  I haven't played anything like this.  I love the time travel element and figuring out where you went wrong and trying to change it.  I like the players vs. mastermind.  I really like everything about it.  The biggest hurdle for this game is that it is one heck of a tough game to teach.  The reason being is that it is also really hard to get your head around.  You have to drop most preconceptions of what a game should be to truly enjoy it.  Sadly, due to these hurdles, it is a game that probably a minority of gamers will enjoy and "get".

Update - after 4 plays...2 as protagonist and 2 as mastermind...I'm really enjoying this one.  So far, I've only played First Step scripts.  If the Basic scripts are just as fun, this is going to be a 10.  Fantastic idea and design!

Jury still out on whether this can be a 10.  It kind of flops, like most co-ops, if one of the protagonists is extreme "alpha" and at least one other player is reserved.

RATING: 8
Very solid deduction and All-vs-1 game with a unique twist.  I would like to have photocopies of the game sheet, so that the protagonists can mark things down.   The deduction boils down to worrying about which caracters are with other characters, where they are, and how many tokens of different types they have acquired.   There are multiple ways to lose, but only one way to win, so that keeps everybody on their toes.   Complex to teach, but when you see through the plot and card interactions, it becomes simpler to think about as a player.   Probably won't buy this since I don't think we would play it at home enough, but would like to play it more to find out.

Provisional rating after playing as mastermind.  Have yet to play as a protagonist.  All in all, however, this has been - so far - a wonderful deduction game of cat and mouse.

Not so sure about the protagonist side since I've never touched it, but it seems disappointing to be just a little off the mark and have the game stolen from you.

Played once and really enjoyed the deduction aspect of the game. The time loop concept where the board "resets" is clever. Not terribly difficult to teach but this is a game that seems difficult to grasp, even with good instruction, until you've played through at least one scenario. 
I would have to be in the right mood to play because it seemed to run a little longer than it should but that might change now that I know the game better. Looking forward to trying again.

This is a well done secret information game.  It has somewhat overtaken Specter Ops for my favorite One vs. All game but it's still close.  Lots of great mechanics like stacking actions and allows for much more deduction then Specter Ops.  Also plenty of customization with user designed cases so this game will continue to get play for a long time.

Fantastic deduction game with a time-loop theme. The text certainly could have done with some revision, though, as it is needlessly confusing for first-time players (e.g., renaming the "Killer" role to "Assassin" or "Hitman" would reduce overlap with the "Murder" incident/culprit, the "Murder Plan" plot, and the "Serial Killer" role). The team co-op against a Game Master element may not go down so well with particular groups, though.

Wow. Deduction game meets time travel...except this is a deduction game that actually really makes you think. You're given a potential list of scenarios, roles, and possible occurrences on each day. From that, you & your team mates have to figure out who is who and stay alive for each round. Get it wrong, that loop ends & you go back (in time) to the beginning to try it all again. Sounds simple enough but it's really rather tricky. And thinky. This is one of the few DM-type games I've played where the DM/controller/mastermind is actually actively playing the game & not just directing play - they want to win as much as the rest of the players. Really enjoyed this.

This is the first time I have rated a game a 10. I love deduction games & this is possibly my perfect game. The only quibble I have is the obvious lack of replayability once someone has done a scenario (as you can't go back & replay it as a protagonist). But there are plenty of scenarios available online & guidance is given on how to create one yourself.

Tragedy Looper is one of the most unique games I have seen. It is a semi-cooperative deduction game with one player playing the villain and offers a ton of mystery and intrigue. The reason I do not have it ranked higher is that it plays awkwardly without exactly four people, and I rarely have exactly four people. At three players one player has more to do than the others. At two one player has to control all three heroes and it can get a bit overwhelming.

What a hot mess.  

Trying to remember from awhile ago:
Did not work at all.  There were some rules about what was included in which plot? you had to guess, but just because you found out that a component was part of a plot didn't mean the other plots that didn't have it were eliminated, it was all very confusing.

I really like this game a lot.

There are a few things holding it back from greatness.

1)  The components are often difficult to differentiate.  The Mastermind cards look a lot like the protagonist cards, and the paranoia markers look a lot like the Goodwill markers.  The cards can be difficult to read as well.

2)  Card quality - they chip easily, and this can definitely ruin the game - sleeving is a must.

2)  For the Protagonists, if they get beaten badly, it is not very fun for them.  This game is fun when it is close, but with no luck, if someone loses, they can feel pretty down about it.  It depends on who you play with, but there are ways to shift the balance in this game through various rules and scenario options - work hard to try to get the right balance, as it will make a big difference in the game.

A very unique game involving time traveling as a theme/mechanic where the protagonist team tries to stop the mastermind in individual scenario. Such a great 1vMany story based game

The story elements in this game are amazing and the fact that you can create custom scripts to accompany the ones in the book.

The tactic movement and hidden information really add a nice level of suspense for the protagonist and it can also be very hard for the mastermind to keep track of everything and create a good plan, challenging for both sides.

The only downside is that the game takes newer players awhile to get into, the tutorial script takes awhile to run through and game lengths can be a little long.

This is one of those games which gets worse in my memory the more time passes.

It's clear it could be fun for a dedicated group.

But it obstructs the formation of that group in two ways: (1) doesn't 'feel' much like the theme would suggest, and (2) isn't much fun when learning. If pitching the game to people doesn't work, and trying it out doesn't work, how is this supposed to find its audience?

Interesting, to be sure. I will reserve final judgment until I've played as a protagonist, because I imagine each role is quite different.
[EDIT] And as a protagonist, it is still interesting and now super tense. This is a real gem, though admittedly clumsy in some parts--the rules could use some reworking.

Plays like nothing else. Superb. The arc in this game is amazing, as power slowly passes from the Mastermind to the Protagonists.

Don't be tricked into thinking this is much of a story game though, it's way too abstract for that. It's a deduction game played against a strategy game. I got burnt by misselling this as a story heavy game. It requires a lot more investment to play well than your typical story game, and you should play it with people aware of that.

The instruction manual is not complete; you'll need to skim through the FAQ thread for a few details. Still absolutely love this game. It is a weird logic puzzle of cat-and-mouse. Sadly I haven't been able to play any standard-level scenarios yet...

A few FAQ notes, mostly to refresh myself on a few key points:
*Mandatory effects always happen FIRST. If there were two serial killers alone in the same room, they would kill each other (because their effect is mandatory). Or if there was a Serial Killer and a Killer with four intrigue in the same room, the Serial Killer would kill the Killer before the Killer would be able to activate its optional player-killing ability. 
*Card resolution sequence: "Forbit Movement", "Movement", then everything else (with "Forbid" happening first)
*Movement can be explained as if player and Mastermind play two different movement cards on the same person, the resulting movement is the third type of movement.

This is so unusual and so much fun!  It's got a great narrative element which integrates smoothly with the cool deductive stuff. I really enjoy both trying to solve the mystery and trying to figure out what to do with it. Plus, I totally want it to be an anime series now.  

The set scenarios may limit replayability, however, especially when some people have played before and others haven't. (2 plays)

It's like solving a murder mystery by trial and error using a time machine. Players lose when certain conditions occur. But then you get to go back in time, reset everything, and try to get through the scenario again. And with failure comes knowledge... With each reset and each move the Mastermind helps players learn more about the roles the characters play in order to solve the puzzle.

The game is challenging for players, but really hard for the Mastermind who has to prepare an air tight scenario.

While I respect Tragedy Looper for being a wildly different type of deduction game, it has extreme issues with accessibility. Without a regular group, it requires a skilled rules teacher playing the game as the Mastermind (which, for my circumstances, is almost always going to be me).

I'm keeping the game for now because I have confidence that more plays will increase my rating, but I'm going to need to play with players who have played before (to allow myself to play as a Protagonist). If that doesn't happen, I may need to trade this one away.

Things I like about Tragedy Looper:

1. Deduction if you're a protagonist.  The slow trickle of information is neat.  Actually, it's more like an occasional deluge or epiphany.

2. Being able to just say, "sorry, you guys lose." And watch them try to figure out what the hell just happened.

3. Bluffing.  Red herrings and baiting abounds.

4. Binary win condition.  Either you win or you lose.  There's none of that arbitrary end game tally that hardly seems to follow the action of the game.

5. It's very tense.  In my first (friendly) game as the mastermind, my pulse must have quickened as if I were in a high stakes tournament game.  I asked everyone else if they were warm.  Nope, it was just me.

WOW!! Amazing Semi Co-Op game. Tragedy Looper is THE deduction game. It can be very complex, so it isn’t for everybody, but I love it. 

This is my fourth year in the hobby, so it’s become harder and harder for me to find very novel games, still Tragedy Looper is very novel and unique. I’m currently very excited about it and it has a permanent spot in my game collection (and to think I bought it by mistake, it must be fate :D).

The theme is amazing as well, we are time travelers trying to stop bad things from happening, to accomplish this we have to relive again and again some events (like Groundhog Day and Edge of Tomorrow) doing different things each day AND trying to deduce what the hell I going on. The game mechanics support perfectly the theme. 

The explanation can be, somewhat, involved. But at the core it is a very simple game as, each turn, the mastermind plays 3 cards and the each player plays a card as well. The hard (an interesting) part is to analyze the Masterminds moves (why did he increase paranoia on that character? Is it a bluff?) and why or why not an event triggers. It isn’t as simple as it sounds as the protagonist have to deduce the correct plot and subplot, which character roles are present in the plots, the role of each character (if any), and how to save the day. The game comes with very good aids IMO, all the info is there but connecting the dots can be hard and fun. Even if you correctly deduced what is going on you still need to play the cards perfectly for the win, otherwise the Mastermind can still win. Also a bad deduction can spell doom for he protagonists.

I have heard some people complain the game has no structure and that it is very hard for the protagonist to win. I’m not sure this is the case, I lost my initial game (but it could have been won), but I also saw how the same Mastermind lost another game. Besides I feel Tragedy Looper has lots of structure so playing cards in you turn isn’t that hard, (If you want a deduction game without any structure try Sherlock Holmes, a game I find very unsatisfying). I also believe that playing the Mastermind isn’t as easy as most players tend to think. I will try it very soon.

In every Semi Co-Op game I have played, I have always wanted to be the bad guy (Overlord, Jack the Ripper, Mister X, etc.), however this one is the exception. I would be happy if I only played as a protagonist. I feel here is the most fun because the Mastermind doesn’t need to deduce anything, he already knows the plots and is only concerned in trying to accomplish them. I will try it soon to see how I like it. I think I will because I like to outsmart my opponents (who doesn’t?).

One weakness of the game (as any deduction game) is that if the Mastermind makes a mistake the game breaks, another concern is that the game only comes with 10 scripts, after you play them as a protagonist, you could only replay them as the Mastermind. However (I think, I haven’t read the rules yet) the game comes with rules to create your own scripts so I don’t think this will be an issue for me. Besides the game has some expansions in Japanese, so I think they will be released in English. For my part, I will try to play as a protagonist all 10 scripts and then I will bring the game to another game group to act as the Mastermind. 

I’m not sure what is the correct player number to play Tragedy Looper. I’m leaning toward 4 players because it is easier to deduce with more brains, however an alpha player can ruin the group experience. 

I’m amazed that I only played with the basic rules (which is totally fine in this game), I think the game has more advanced and complex rules. I want to try them :D.

Bottom line, Tragedy Looper is a great brain burner deduction game, possibly my favorite. I want to play it again ASAP. It’s been a long time since I was this excited about a game. It has the potential to go even higher in my personal ratings. Try it before you buy it as it clearly isn’t a game for everyone. Very novel.

After more plays I continue to love Tragedy Looper, and the game surprised me again. Playing as the Mastermind is also very hard and most fun than I expected. I read the rules and I want to try the advanced version, also it does come with guidelines to create new scripts so the replay value is high.

With more plays I think it can continue to go up in my personal rating and even become the best 2011 game for me.

Time will tell.

I finally played with the advanced rules (called Basic in the game manual) and it was a blast. In this setting, the difficulty is very high for all the players so I always have fun with Tragedy Looper. Still the Mastermind needs to be extra careful not to make any rules mistake, because if he does the game can leave a bad taste, other than that the game is pure gold for me.

I love the new rules (the final guessing, the limited table talk, the new roles and incidents) and the new scripts. Now you have two subplots to discover/manage.

I´m upgrading Tragedy Looper´s rating and now it is the Game of the Year for me. I love to play it and I hope they release more scripts soon. I know you can do your own but I always prefer to play other´s people designs. An amazing game.

One of 2011´s favorites.

I really like this deduction game. I've only played it once with two players, but it was a lot of fun. It's very thematic, but I have to admit that the theme was just window dressing for me. As the master mind it boiled down to trying to obfuscate what I was doing, and as the protagonist my wife was mostly focused on figuring out which roles were in play and who was what on the board.

Tragedy Looper is a challenging game to describe and teach. I can best liken it to a game like Zendo, wherein one player configures their game pieces to conform to a rule (such as "2 pieces must point to the right") and the other players try to deduce the rule by arranging their pieces and being told they are right or wrong. A less precise but better known analogy would be Mastermind. The added step that makes Tragedy Looper different is that the deduction of secret roles of the characters is not the goal of the game. The goal is to learn which character is going to die and use what you deduce of the secret roles to prevent the death (the "tragedy") from happening. The Key Role you are trying to protect (the identity of whom also needs to be deduced) can potentially die in multiple ways. Deducing those ways and then manipulating the characters and their actions to avoid deadly situations for your Key Role - THAT is the goal. You "loop" back in time 3-4 times most games and each loop consists of a certain number of days (rounds). If you can keep your Key Role alive for a single loop, you win.

What I describe above is the role of the Protagonists. One player is also a Mastermind who is trying to create situations on the board that cause the death of the Key Role character. Either the Mastermind will win or the Protagonists will win as a team. Situations are manipulated by playing face-down action cards onto the characters or locations. These cards, when flipped, move characters to different locations or manipulate one of three statistics (paranoia, intrigue, and goodwill). The statistics are used to activate abilities of the characters or to create the conditions that cause the death of a character or some other incident (usually bad for the Protagonists). There are also cards that block each of these actions. Each day (round) the Mastermind plays 3 cards and the Protagonists play 1 card each.

I love the concept of this game. With the right audience and some patience in learning the roles and how they operate, this will easily become someone's favorite game. As you deduce partial information, it starts to become a game a cat and mouse as known situations are avoided, but new situations and risk points arise that may also need to be avoided in future loops. There are a few hurdles with the game, however, that I think might be too much for my usual players to overcome. 1) The initial learning curve is steep, mostly because key information is hidden and even when you deduce something, it is hard to remember all of the situations you need to avoid. For the game to flow well without too many overt mistakes (for either the Protagonists or the Mastermind), you really need a keen understanding of how the secret roles operate. That takes a number of rough, patient play-throughs to learn. The reference sheet is great, but there's A LOT of information on it to digest. 2) On top of understanding the roles, they activate through the manipulation of statistics that create an ever-changing board state that is difficult to decipher the implications of from turn to turn. 3) Everyone at the table MUST be fully invested in the spirit of the game, or else it won't really engage. Finding 4 players of equal investment into such a brain-bending deduction game will be a challenge for most play groups. It certainly is for mine. While I'd be game for that level of engagement, I can't do it alone.

I really enjoyed this game as the master mind and would love to be able to play as one of the protagonists. though, I think my opportunities for the latter are slim.

My only problem in getting this game back out has been the amount of effort needed to prepare as the mastermind to do the game justice and the whims of my gaming group. I have prepared twice for a second game only to have the group want to play something else, so my effort was wasted.

RATING: 7
I was happily surprised by this game. I had no idea what to expect, and I have no familiarity with the source material (if there is any, it does seem to be based on an anime IP, but maybe that's just the theme). The game is one of deduction and double-guessing. There is an overlord who is trying to cause you to loose, and a book of scenarios to play. In a scenario there is a particular plot and subplot which provide different roles and abilities to the overlord and characters (NPCs). The job of the players is to deduce which plot and subplot have been chosen, what roles NPCs have and then avoid the loose conditions that can be triggered. 

The game is played over a series of loops, each loop is a run through of the scenario. There are several loose conditions and if one is triggered during the loop it ends and a new loop begins. Everything is reset and hopefully the players gained some information in their defeat. Depending on the scenario you have some number of loops to 'get it right' and survive the scenario without triggering a loose condition. 

The deduction and guessing of the overlord's motivations is a lot of fun, and hard work! It's a very clever game which will get better with more plays as people become more familiar with the possibilities and how to make deductions in the game's framework.

Rating could go up, I want to play this more.

One of the best One-vs-all game I have played. Although 
it is kind of hard to wrap the theme & mechanic around if the player have never experience watching "time travel in loop" like Higurashi & Steins Gate, anime&movie&game. 

The gameplay is definitely interesting and challenging for both side, a great Mastermind player can also narrate the event to add on to the mystery&story-telling aspect of the game.

A game that was touted to be a mindbending revelation really felt to me more like a complex game of Mr Jack. Each character has a role that the other players need to guess. And you make deductions by moving or placing markers on them. End of the loop, you see/test your results.

I don't think its a bad game, but I wouldn't say its great either. Felt more like a group activity than anything else.

First game was maybe the roughest rules explanation I've ever done considering I was a new mastermind and did not have everything well connected rules Wise in my head yet.   I very much needed to read directly from the rulebook.  However with very patient players we muddied through it and spun the game.   Really took about 2 goes to finally nail some of the smaller details but wow once we did we were flying and it felt great.   It's still a brain burner because even when you really think you know what's going you still need to continue "preventing" the tragedy.  I had a chance to play both as mastermind and as protagonist.  I had a tough time with some of the rules but I think bit had more to do with my thickness than anything else.    

  This game is amazing and perhaps one of the most unique games that I own.  I don't know that I've ever gotten this INTO a game.  I even couldn't resist an evil laugh whilst playing the mastermind.   Glorious.  Can't wait to play again.

RATING: 8
Brain-burning one vs, many deduction game. This game may scare off a lot of new people since it seems kind of hard for them to grasp it. Game also suffers from "how many plays you get out of it." If you don't have a consistent gaming group, it may be hard to know what scenario people have played, but at least there a variety of scenarios online or you can come up with your own. Another downside is one mistake from the game master can screw up the whole game. Feels like a love it or hate it game so you're taking a risk with who you play with on this one. A gameplay could be great fun or awful.

Very unique game with a reiterative time-travel mechanic.  Players work together to prevent unpleasant events that have happened in the past. They start the game being largely ignorant of the story and have to learn as they go.  They work against a "mastermind" who is trying to ensure that the tragedies (suicides, murders, cult activity etc.) actually occur.  So far, I've only played the "mastermind".  I wasn't great at it (players solved the introductory plot on their second attempt), but I loved it.  So much fun watching everyone work towards a solution with occasional missteps. I said "Mwha-ha-ha" once or twice. My only complaint is that the stories feel a bit abstract. Guess I was paying more attention to game mechanics instead of role-playing possibilities.

Lots of good ideas but too long and (for the mastermind) lots of waiting around for the others to decide what to do.

we thought the 'no communication' option would speed it up but it made it even worse.

if the 'good guys' are logical it seems they can always work out the final role puzzle, especially on the 4 loop games. (anything over 4 loops... wow! i can't even imagine playing that!!)

So lots of good things but i would need convincing to play again!

This is a HEAVY game.  do not go in thinking it's just a simple guessing game, because it is not.  If you can find people who understand how to play and like playing detective, you'll have a hit on your hands.  However, if your group is hard to focus, or easily distracted, play something else, because this game will punish you for not paying attention.  This game requires a lot of commitment by the host/mastermind, whereas it will be a bit easier for everyone else in the room to enjoy.  Writing scripts is not as difficult as it sounds, and once you get it gameplay is smooth, fun, and deep.  Getting into it however, takes effort, and it will only be worthwhile if you can stick to it.

Tragedy Looper is a scenario-based deduction game for two to four players: one mastermind and one to three protagonists. The game consists of four location boards and a number of character cards. Each scenario features a number of characters, hidden roles for these characters (serial killer, conspiracy theorist, friend), and some pre-set tragedies (murder, suicide).

A deduction game where 3 time travelers are trying to stop the mastermind for performing his evil plan. The protagonists win if they can survive just one week, while the mastermind wins if he can make the protagonists lose all of the loops. The rules are a bit complex for beginners as there are a lot of abilities to keep track of, as well as many losing condition. The mastermind has a lot more rules to know, compare with the protagonists, and some fast thinking is required. 2 and 4 players recommended (not 3 players)

Loving this one. 3v1 deduction game, and unlike most games with a mastermind the mastermind has to play their ass off to have a chance of winning this one. Also, half the rulebook is guidance for coming up with your own scenarios so there should be loads of replayability here.

Played through scenario 6 with A, C, and M.
Played scenario 7 with C, M, M2o, and M.
Played scenario 2 from Midnight Circle with C, M, and T. I think this scenario is more difficult than the book says. The protagonists were very busy the whole time just trying to stop me from achieving a win condition and didn't seem to have the actions they needed to figure out what role each character had.
Played scenarios 1 and 3 with @Drey and B

This game has a steep and unforgiving learning curve and can be quite intimidating with all the charts and scenarios.

RATING: 9
Sure this game mechanically may not be as revolutionary as the theme suggests, with it being very similar to Letters from Whitechapel in that the mastermind is trying to accomplish some task and the good guys initially have no idea what's going on but gradually piece together clues at each attempt, with one victory condition being to just stall the mastermind long enough. However, this game builds on the already solid deduction and thematic flair of Letters from Whitechapel and takes it to another level. The scenarios with the varying powers of the characters, along with the incidents to spice up everything may make the game more complicated, but they really set the tone of e.g. yes, I really am trying to murder everyone, avoiding the problem that Whitechapel despite its thematic feel is technically an abstract hidden movement game. The mastermind has to be very careful balancing winning the loop and not giving out too much information. The heroes unlike Whitechapel can also play in a much more aggressive manner if they so choose to kind of "force" information reveals (e.g. there's a reason the heroes have +1 Paranoia cards and the mastermind -1 to counteract it).

That being said, this game is not for everyone or perhaps even most people, and it's not helped by a below average rulebook. This game was really designed with 4 players in mind, and the fact that only one player can have played the scenario before can make it really restrictive if you have a small game group that isn't exactly 4 people, especially since it's not the easiest game to learn (the mechanics aren't actually that convoluted, it's just so out there that there's nothing familiar to compare it to). I think the best way to play it is as a campaign with the same people, so that you don't have to repeat the same first steps scenarios too many times, and so you will have people who are familiar with the flow before you tackle the more complicated scenarios.

I've seen lots of complaint about the anime art, but there is nothing remotely risque in this game. Sure maybe you just don't like the cartoony look as a whole, but please don't dismiss this game because of fears of overly sexualized characters.

Card quality is not good and I already have several noticeably scuffed cards, be sure to sleeve.

EDIT after playing all scripts: Hmm I might have given too much of an impression on its similarities with Whitechapel. I meant it has the general idea where the heroes initially have no idea what is going on and must gradually tighten the net, but Whitechapel definitely has a stronger spatial aspect, whereas Tragedy Looper has more card play and variable powers. Personally I thought each script felt pretty differently, although that was not an opinion shared by everyone in my group. There were a couple of games that basically came down to a 50/50 guess, but I didn't really mind because I felt like the game if you can't win outright before the final guess is more about the deduction/obfuscation than whoever actually wins or loses. Originally table talk rules were set pretty loosely in my group, but if the protaganists have good team chemistry it's almost better for them not to talk too much because it gives away their plans to the mastermind. Depending on how much people spend trying to predict each other's moves the game's length can be quite variable, but I felt even in long games I was engaged until the end. Many will say the learning curve is too great, the game can drag, that it has very poorly defined and sometimes completely incorrectly translated rules, but personally the only thing holding me back from rating it at least a 9 is my fear of lack of replayability. If I find out I can in fact think up decent scripts on my own, that will be a huge boon to this game.

EDIT 2: Finished Steins Gate recently, and I think while there is a couple of things that are more strongly reminiscent of Steins Gate (e.g. importance of a phone and pocket watch) overall I think the game draws a lot more inspiration from Higurashi.

Tragedy Looper is another that's dropped solely because it just doesn't get to the table enough. I love the time looping. I love the premise.

I like the idea but the way the rules and the information is laid out makes it such hard work. Its like a big logic puzzle - if A then B then C. I suppose it is a bit like Scotland Yard but more complicated. As mastermind you really have to be up on what each character does and i dont feel like the starter goes really make that clear. There need to be more examples. 

Also it is annoying that everyone is so obsessed with spoilers in videos about this. There needs to be a video of the first scenario with someone talking through all the things. People don't have to watch it. But it would really help if the mastermind watched it.

The game is truly original, I have not played another game like it.  It is a good deductive game with an element of competition between the team of "protagonists" and the "mastermind," a setup I usually enjoy (for example in games like Scotland Yard).  Rules are easy to understand and remember.  Looking forward to more plays.  Tentative rating, might increase with repeated plays.

Brilliant deduction game, that has the great advantage of a constantly evolving gameplay. What starts as a deduction game, quickly becomes, as the days (turns) and loops (rounds) pass by, a war of wits and bluffing. A true struggle of who can outsmart his opponent, that leads to a climactic endgame. That being said, the whole "experience" depends heavily on the ability of the Mastermind not to play linearly thus revealing too fast all the hidden information. 

Quite thematic. Simple rules, very accessible game. Though it may seems hard and convoluted at first, after a few turns all fit together perfectly. Highly recommended.

1 playthrough as mastermind (script 1). Will adjust rating with more plays.

 - Explaining it was more complex than I expected. This is primarily my failure to explain properly combined with their desire not to spend an extra half an hour going over the rules. Recommendation: Get your friends to watch Rahdo's playthrough video instead.

 - Component quality was poor. The boards were noticeably warped. Tokens and cards were fine (although I put the mastermind action cards into opaque sleeves anyway).

 - As the mastermind, it was fun to try to anticipate what my opponents might do, consider what options would maximize my coverage, and listen in on my opponents discussing their planned moves so that I could play certain cards knowing they were themselves providing coverage for my actions.

 - As Rahdo noted, play in the early loops was about hiding as much information as possible and trying to mislead your opponents while still satisfying objectives while the final loop is a game of bluffing into the right combination to meet expectations.

[COLOR=#FF3300]This is an interesting take on time travel and deduction. Usually, a deduction is something everyone tries to complete on their own, but here, not only one person (mastermind) knows what has already happened, but the other people work as a team to solve the mysteries, while the evil fella tries to disrupt them as much as possible. Great! But wouldn't really recommend playing this in a 2 player game.[/COLOR]

Definitely a "not for me" game. Much of the game is a logic deduction puzzle, which I would rather find in a more abstract package (think Zendo). Making it cooperative does not improve the experience, and the typical cooperative restrictions on talking and showing hands is decidedly annoying rather than interesting. The endgame devolves into a guessing game of "if he zigs, we have to zag, and vice versa," which some people find exciting but I find deflating.

Stuck in a PBF game, I can already see the flaws in this thing. It's a brilliant idea, but poorly implemented, and mostly I feel annoyed and frustrated. And that's apparent even in the positive reviews and videos - everyone sort of hesitates when they talk about how "great" the experience is. They are afraid of "spoilers" but the fact that there is information that can be spoiled is the exact flaw--it creates a situation where not only do the protagonist players not know what is going on, they don't know how to find out either.

All the guessing and double guessing is phenomenal... I love games were the cards are played face-down and are all revealed at the same time... we have to go in the other players head and try to determine what they are doing, and even more in this game... The protagonists have to enter the Mastermind head and try to figure out the Plot, sub-plot and the roles of each Character... and then try to deduce what he's trying to do and foil his plans!

Great game!

This is an abstract team vs one game where the mastermind is trying to arrange things on the board so that he wins and the players are trying to stop him.  This doesn't feel like a thematic game to me: playing the game gives little or no sense of story - it just feels like your moving around pawns, or placing & removing token to enable or prevent special abilities.  The catch is that the players start the game with little information about what board state leads to a loss, so there is a deductive, logic-puzzle aspect to the game where the players are trying to figure that out.  As a deduction game, its not too difficult.  Usually the mastermind ends up tipping his hand and players figure things out.  But getting all the protagonists to do the right thing to stop him without talking is still a challenge in itself.  Overall, a very good, unique game.  It's really hard to teach.  It's really hard to play the mastermind well.  I'd pick letters from Whitechapel over this any time we had 2 or 3 players!

I love some of the mechanics of this game. I especially liked the deduction, bluffing and WIFOM aspects. However, there is a lot going on and almost too much for players to keep track of, including lots of referrals to rule tables that make it tough to learn for new players. It should appeal to those who love cooperative games. It doesn't really remind me of any other game I've played other than Avalon Hill's Down with the King but that is a very distant comparison. I suspect that some clever designer will be "inspired" by this game and create a more streamlined reimplementation.

This game broke my mind. No seriously, it really did. The win conditions and means of engagement this game offers is by far the most unique thing I have read in ages. It will take some effort to learn how to play. Further, some folks just won't....get it. Recommend playing with table talk allowed the first few times. Once table talk is turned off, the game becomes such a fantastic experience...well, as long as you don't mind groping about in the dark trying to figure out who is trying to kill whom.

I did not love it, but I think it is probably an OK game. It was difficult to pick up on. Once I caught up, the play was good...I liked the logic, deduction, and cooperative play. I probably would have liked this game a lot more if the theme was something other than modern anime.

One of the most innovative and unique games I've ever played.  The only downside is the learning curve.  Once you can wrap your head around how it works, it is brilliant.  Put in the time to learn the rules very well before you try to hook your friends on it.  It is well worth it.

I've only attempted this game once with 3 players and it was not very fun. However, that's due less to the gameplay and more to us trying to figure out how to play! It's a neat concept and the game is unique--I just need to get the rules under my belt and try it again. I know there's a good game in here!

Wow! Something was seriously lost in translation here. I thought I was time-traveling to stop a tragic incident, but it turns out all I was doing was labeling non-player characters. "Hi, my name is Male Student. I'll be your Serial Killer for today."

Tragedy Looper's scenarios are like some kind of extra-terrestrisl police reports of an event; detached and sterile. Each suspect is defined by one or two abilities they can enact, lacking any motive or explanation. Their abilities trigger based on a character's buildup of Goodwill, Intrigue, or Paranoia; three disconnected quantifiers that could have better been united by an emotional theme (Happiness, Anger, Sadness or whatever). 

Despite the convoluted deduction needed to recognize characters, each player only takes one or two actions a game turn and then watches how things play out. With some more development these mechanisms could make for a decent game, but currently it is completely undermined by an endgame victory condition where all that is necessary is to provide the scenario's dramatis personae, rather than stopping the actual tragedy!

Coating this clunky gameplay is truly terrible graphic design. Shadowy textures overlaid with ornate fonts and generic anime art, all in the same color palette of orange, blue, and purple, makes for ugly, indistinguishable components.

I went into this game interested, and found it a total letdown.

RATING: 9.5
Tragedy Looper is the bastard child of Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective, the television show Quantum Leap, and the video game Braid.  All v. 1.  The scriptwriter knows exactly what's going to happen, while the protagonists have to figure out a) what story is in progress, b) what roles the main players have in that story, and c) how they can prevent the inevitable from happening.  I say "inevitable" because the badness WILL happen, but the protagonists will have a certain number of opportunities to "loop" back in time and try to solve the puzzle again, knowing what they now know.  Run out of loops, and you lose.  Prevent the tragedy(ies) from happening, and you win.

The first game I played was Ghost Stories hard.  And it will stick with you: You'll know exactly where you precious plan screwed up, and you'll counter it this time... only to have the scriptwriter twist the knife deeper next loop.  It's an absolute mindfuck of a puzzle and I can't rave about it enough.

The only reasons I'm not rating it higher are a) the learning curve is the Cliffs of Insanity (and this will not be the ONLY Princess Bride reference you will make while playing Looper), given all the characters, roles, culprits, and cascading events that COULD happen, and b) without an experienced scriptwriter I'm certain this game will fall a little flat - not a problem except for a).  Also, I'm not a fan of the anime, but I will suffer through it because the game is just.  That.  Good.

Cooperativo contro il master. Il gioco non è immediato, soprattutto giocarlo bene. Ci trovo però molta originalità in questi looper che riavvolgono il nastro per cercare di risolvere il caso. Idea geniale e gioco da provare spesso per comprenderne la longevità (a prescindere dal fatto che gli scenari al momento sono solo 10). Trovo che il gioco renda, e diverta, di più se si lascia libero il dialogo.

I enjoyed this novel approach. You try and get through a scenario without a death, but each with attempt you gather more information about which character might be performing what role, and you use that information to stop that tragedy happening next time. The aim is to get through the scenario (in your given number of attempts) just once without a death. There's two major elements at play - after all cards are played, stuff happens (like adding a paranoia token, or a character being killed). You can see what role or roles perform those abilities, so you can deduce that such a role must belong to one of the two characters in that room where it happened, narrowing it down. Each time through you'll get more info, but you only get so many attempts, so you need to maximise each opportunity. Once you get a feel for who can do what, you can get a feel for what cards the mastermind might be playing to get the right characters in a room together for bad stuff to happen, or maybe adding tokens to trigger stuff. It's your aim therefore to deduce what each character can do (from the given list), and play cards to ensure they can't do their designated bad thing. If you can do all that by the last time through, the last loop, you'll win. Of course, the mastermind knows what you know, so he might be playing cards other than what you think that, when combined with your expected cards, get him the outcome he wants. So this is the second major element - the outguessing of the mastermind once things become more known. Which makes for a nice double-whammy. Deduction games are usually far more abstract - Deduce or Die, Eleusis, Sleuth, Code 777, etc. Bringing a huge slash of theme to the genre is a nice step forward, and the game is nicely different in feel as a result. I look forward to exploring it more.

Based on one play: One of the most original mechanics and themes I have seen in a while. You are stuck in a loop of time and must prevent an event from occurring, however you do not know what it is or who it involves, just that when it happens, you are reset back to the starting instance and must try again. You have a limited amount of days and loops to prevent this event. The mastermind and the players each play 3 action cards either on characters or locations and the players must work together to prevent this unknown event. Confusing at first but a great surprise. If you are looking for an original mechanic and theme that works well involving deduction and discussion it is well worth a try. I only played the easy intro scenario but would love to play a more advanced scenario.

Tragedy Looper is a cooperative deduction game with a mastermind player, a little like Scotland Yard. This is a scenario-based game in which the players have to prevent a certain “key person” character from dying. However, if that key character dies, the players enter another “time loop” Groundhog Day-style and try to prevent it again. The game ends if the players can successfully make it through a scenario without the key person dying, or if a specified number of time loops elapse. Neither the players nor the mastermind are represented by specific characters; instead, they play action cards on characters and locations to affect them in various ways. I’m not usually a big fan of cooperative games, but this one really got my brain going. Trying to figure out why the mastermind player did certain things, and use logic to figure out which characters play which roles was really engaging for me. Easily the best deduction game I’ve played. My only caveat is that the scenario-based nature of the game makes it difficult to play with different sets of players each time.

Preliminary rating: have only played the first three scripts (although I have played the first one about 6 times), but definitely has potential. I will rerate this if I ever manage to play more scripts. 

That song "Like A Virgin" by Madonna? This game made me feel like a board game virgin. The first time playing, NOBODY ever quite gets what the hell is going on or how to play it. It's extremely unique. After the first turn of the first script and you lose and have to reset for the second loop, you're left just blinking and staring at the board, wondering what the hell you're supposed to do with what you just saw. The player aids are mystifying, and you feel like you've never played a board game before in your life. 

It really is incredibly unique, and has loads of potential. I see this going up upon further plays, but as it stands (from just the first few scripts that I've played, mostly as the Mastermind) scenarios are difficult to balance. Not that that is the most important thing in the universe.

I think this game rivals Dead of Winter in terms of evoking a theme for everyone involved at the table. The time travel schtick and level of abstraction takes a little bit of getting used to, especially in terms of teaching the game.

Played this so far once as a mastermind and I enjoyed it.  But man this is the only game I've ever played where I actually was a tiny bit exhausted from thinking when I was done.  I feel like that would change if I played it more often so I got used to the mechanics, but as of now this game is tiring.

But the other problem with this game is that I feel like I will rarely play it unless if I go to gamer meetups.  I think it would be very hard to convince my group to try it out and I'm not even sure if I would want to teach someone how to play this game, which would be the first time I've ever felt that way towards a game.

Update: It's been at least 2-3 months since that last update and this game has shot up in plays and score.  I can now teach players this game in under 10-15 minutes, and it's just awesome.  Now that I understand 99% of the rules this game is less exhausting and just simply more fun to play.

No game comes closer to being like truly solving a mystery than this one.  The mystery is there, the mastermind knows the roles of all the characters, it is up to you to find them.  You can't know directly, you can only interact with the characters and watch their responses and behaviors and draw conclusions from that.  And then, once you know, the true cat and mouse begins!  Because even when you know the role of every character (at least, with some high likelihood!), so does the mastermind!  So, do you try to move the serial killer away from the key person, or will the mastermind anticipate that and move the key person into the murderer?  Or into the conspiracy theorist that tips their paranoia level over into suicide??  Do you instead move the key person away from the serial killer???  A delicious experience unlike any other game I own.  And becoming a masterful mastermind is a challenge all its own.  

I love introducing people to this game and watching the rollercoaster of emotions take hold.  First, total bafflement and confusion.  Then, revelation.  Then, frustration!  Then, confidence.  Then desperation.  Then, sudden hope.  Despair!  Triumph!  Despair!

A dark dance of logic and psychology.  Endlessly entertaining.

Deduction game. 1 vs many that are trying to solve the mystery in the past. I love the anime and the Japanese style. For me this was a very rough play. We lost the first scenario and we really just played poorly. I want to pick it up a notch and play a harder one to see if we can do it. I own the game from a math trade and am going to keep it for now. I don't know if I should have higher hopes or not. For me it was just ok.

this is a really great game. the 3 points off are for replayability. If you own this game, you're going to play as the bad game every time. Once you play a scenario (on either side), you can't ever play it as a good guy again. And unless you play with someone else who has played before that is willing to spoil a scenario, you're going to be the bad guy for new scenarios you haven't played, thus making you ineligible to play as a good guy in the future.

Demo'd it in Gen Con and fell in love with this. I really like the deduction and mystery solving aspect of the game, and the theme of time traveling to solve a crime is really cool. There is one mastermind player and 3 protagonist players. The mastermind's job is ensure the set tragedy happens. The protagonists' job is to prevent the tragedy from happening by figuring out what the mystery is, and who the culprits are, before the time loop runs out.

This game has a very hard learning curve to teach and play. It's unlike any other game I've play. The mastermind has to make sure that the protagonist players don't get too much information to quickly prevent the tragedy from happening, and the protagonist has to use every little clue given to solve the mystery.

A deduction game masterpiece. It's a real brain-burning (mostly for the Mastermind player) and it needs the right people at the table, but it returns a SUPER satisfying experience.

The best deduction game I played tied with Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective; the latter is richer in flavor, simple and perfect for everyone, while the former is more deep and dynamic, a real 'game-system' with great math basis and a pure genious mechanic.

No other game I own plays anything like Tragedy Looper. It is a game of cat and mouse where the Mastermind must continually outwit the Protagonists in new and unsignaled ways.

Torn about this game: It has highly original mechanics. However, I wasn't able to absorb all the rules at once, which meant I couldn't play or deduce with any confidence. I had to rely on other players (thank god this is co-operative). So I found this game very frustrating because I was too stupid to comprehend the consequences of my actions (and foresee the potential actions of the mastermind.)

RATING: 9
Tragedy Looper is an awesome deduction game for four people.   Three players play as time travelers trying to stop some horrible event from occurring.  Problem is, they have no idea what the story is, who the NPC characters who populate the board are, or what - if any - malevolent actions they may harbor.   The fourth player knows everything, and his job is to make sure the other three players do not succeed in saving the day.

The game play is simple, and totally unlike anything I've played before.  The three protagonist players win the game if at the end of the story they have not lost.  However, there are many game loss scenarios, most of which the players will never know about until they happen and they loose.
BUT WAIT!  Here's the key that prevents this from being a game of total frustration: every time they loose the game, the protagonist players get to talk about what they think happened at the board, and time travel back to the beginning of the game to try again, empowered by the knowledge of how the last cycle ended.    They get to do this 4-5 times depending on the story in play before the jig is up.

I could keep going on about the clever mechanics in this game, the wonderful pacing, how easy it is to trip eachother up, and the difficulty for the evil player to keep his evil plans secret, but the main take away I wish to impart is that this is truly an amazing experience.

I surprised at how much i liked this game and am being overly critical with a 6 rating.
A deduction game of the difficult order.  You will lose as the protagonists, especially, if like me, you play the wrong card.
The fun is working out what cards the evil master mind is activating and therefore what plan is afoot. Actually stopping them, well, that's a different matter as so many things can cause you to fail.
So why the low rating? Because i can't see myself playing it that often.  It sits in the same realm of game such as Twilight Imperium.  Good /  Great games that take a toll on the players and should be seen as an event to be savoured and enjoyed.

Review currently based off a single play as Mastermind.

I loved the idea of Tragedy Looper as soon as I saw and read the box. A mystery game with a Mastermind and 3 players who didn't know what was actually happening in the game. They build up the picture of what is going on by losing and learning.

A very big positive, for me, is that it really requires good teamwork between the players. For this reason, it also requires a certain type of gamer to play. If someone isn't really interested and just kind of does their own thing - the Protaganists will lose. But when the players do work together well, it gets much more difficult for the mastermind to win in subsequent loops.

I really enjoyed the game and look forward to further games - especially playing as the protaganist!

! Comments based on 2 scenario plays in which not all gaming rules were followed correctly !

(+) The game really feels like it is telling a story

(+) Intriguing gameplay

(+) Original concept

(-) Annoying rulebook

(-) Problematically low replay value: the final scenario's are far more complex, so you should probably take new players through the first scenario's. However, if you are a couple, your partner can not participate in previously played scenarios as a fellow protagonist. This is a real deal-breaker.

(-) Scenarios don't feel really balanced.

(-) No player aid to write stuff down for protagonists?

The game I had to re-read the rulebook for the most (yes, that includes Vlaada Chvatil games!) because there really isn't much of a frame of reference for this game.

If you have the right crowd, this game is really incredible.  The converse true too, which is why I rarely suggest playing it.

Table talk is a tricky issue.  If there's too much of it, then the game drags on too long, but too little leaves new players utterly confused.  A good middle ground is to allow table talk on the first game except that players cannot indicate what card they played.  On subsequent games, be strict about no table talk.  The printable player aids are probably also a good idea.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game has a lot of neat elements, but in the end I didn't feel quite satisfied with the experience.  To play analytically, which is how I want to play this type of game, one must read a huge chunk of text and parse how they all interact, just so that you can figure out what options are eliminated by a given piece of evidence.

I think the experience is probably better if you just play fast and loose, and enjoy the weird theme.  But I don't like it when the game rewards boring strategies, which is what I fear is going on here.

Still, there is a quite interesting tension between the two sides, and I like how you combine deduction with tactical maneuvering and second guessing.

It's hard to get this to the table.  It requires a group that is completely dedicated to learning the rules; not that they are particularly difficult to learn, but what there is needs to be known quite well, and the Mastermind must absolutely know all rules and be very focused in order for the game to succeed.

But this is such a rewarding game, if you do have the chance to play it.  It offers a pure and interesting deduction experience, and it is one of those rare games wherein the theme is so strong and ever-present that it's inseparable from the mechanics of the game.

No need to be turned off by the limited number of scenarios, as there are plenty of good fan-made ones available online, and the rules also contain well-thought-out instructions for creating your own balanced and interesting scenarios.  I myself just wish I could play this often enough to get through the first ones that came packaged with it.

My biggest complaint with Tragedy Looper is how much it relies on the Mastermind (which is a very lonely position). This has nearly been replaced by T.I.M.E. Stories in my mind: the looping time to discover new avenues, the logic brain-burning, and the cooperative nature, and all without the need for a segregated player that has to outsmart three other people.

If you love deduction games, then this board game is for you. This RPG deduction board game takes deduction to a whole new level. It's a team or up to 3 players versus 1 mastermind, with the "protagonists" having to play in such a way to prevent the tragedy from happening. Requires a lot of logic. The only downside is the teaching time, as every time a new person comes to play the game, you need to go back to the easier levels.

Very interesting design for a deduction game. Can be extremely fun but is flawed in a few ways:

1) Really difficult to advance multiple plays unless you are really into the game.
2) Too many things to remember and keep note of for both players and mastermind. The player aids could be designed better.
3) The game can break down into a game of flipping chances rather than actual deduction.

[i][center]You've met with a terrible fate, haven't you?[/center][/i]
The unwitting protagonists of Tragedy Looper are taken straight to the centre of a mastermind's conspiracy. If the events take a dark turn – and they undoubtedly will – the protagonists get to replay the entire loop. With each passing loop, the protagonists gather more information on how to outwit the mastermind and guide the story to a happier conclusion.

Depending on how you look at it, the rules for the game oscillate between being richly layered and downright convoluted. The deductive element is driven by a haphazard network of plots, characters and incidents, and sprinkled with the occasional confusing terminology. Still, this is a cracking deduction game with the right group. Each of the mastermind’s actions potentially reveals the true nature of the scenario, but communication restrictions between the protagonists creates another hurdle. The loops become increasingly tense as the noose tightens around the mastermind.

Just bear in mind that the mastermind needs to be particularly adept in dealing with the cogs and gears in the machinery. Missing the trigger for an ability or event can jeopardise the entire deduction process.

What a crazy game. Does a lot of super interesting things I haven't seen in games before but takes quite a while to wrap your head around. The rulebook is kind of a nightmare (it over-explains everything to the point of absurdity) and could be much better written/simplified to help new players (instead of being split into many parts and scattering information all over the place).

Once you figure out how to actually play it's a super interesting, unique game that I really enjoyed and hope to play more of. But it's hard to recommend to anyone not willing to fight through the crappy rulebooks.

Brain-burnery 3v1 deduction game.  I love the time travel theme, and I think I enjoy deduction games more than most.  Using a number of NPCs on the board, the protagonists attempt to deduce the roles and the mastermind's win condition while the mastermind, who has perfect information about the roles, has to bluff to keep information as vague as possible while still achieving his victory condition.  Playing the mastermind is really difficult.

We really enjoyed the game. It is easy to get one player card set confused with the Mastermind cards because the color is almost the same, and the images look similar from far off, which was a bit disappointing, but overall it is an interesting concept with cool anime artwork and the time travel aspect of it is really cool.

1 play, 3er, all new

Cool concept, time travel, but through inexperience and luck Strat and I managed to survive the scenario through the very first loop! I wouldn't mind trying this again, but probably not without reading the rules myself or, even better, have an [i]experienced[/i] player teaching it! 

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Before game, some event(s) happened - a murder, suicide, whatever. You've rewound the clock and are going to try to get through the key days, preventing the key problems. But someone is working against you, so you don't know the details: each loop through, you'll try to learn what you actually need to do to stop this horrible event from happening. 

There's a scenario specific setup, with certain characters positioned in specific locations on the board. Each round, the Mastermind plays some cards (on people and/or locations), then the players do the same. Then, you reveal the cards and resolve their actions: e.g., move from location to location, add/remove paranoia/intrigue/influence(?) counters. Accumulating counters allows other things to happen: specific events, powers, etc. After cards and effects are done, the Mastermind tells you if anything happened (based on specific conditions set out in the script -- e.g., if the right 2 people ended up in the right location with the right counters on them, one of them gets killed). If the key event happens, you rewind time and repeat -- with players trying to figure out what the event was, and prevent it in the next loop. 

If the players manage to get through a loop without the key events happening, they win; if they fail to do so after a scenario-specified number of loops, the Mastermind wins.

-General Impressions
Tragedy Looper is a murder/mystery semi-co-operative deduction game. It's like Fury of Dracula where it's a 1 (mastermind) vs. all (protagonists). It's a very thought provoking game that works very well with a good mastermind.

-What it does
The mastermind is trying to achieve a tragedy (triggering certain loss conditions) and the protagonists try to balk the mastermind by taking anticipatory, or pre-emptive actions.

If the loss conditions are triggered, the game loops back to the original starting point and the protagonist deduce what went awry and what roles are present.

If the protagonists are able to prevent a tragedy from occurring or able to guess all of the hidden roles during the "final guess", they win.

-Why I like it
Tragedy Looper is a real brainburner and is exciting to play with a good mastermind and engaged players. I have to be in the mood to play this, but once this hits the table and everyone is on board, it's a lot of fun.

People may question the replayability, but there is a mastermind handbook that offers instructions and hints on how to make your own plots. Boardgamegeek also has a lot of excellent custom plots and sub-plots to try.

My main concern is the graphic design. It would be better if cardbacks were more visible and if symbols were more intuitive, simpler and brighter. I like designing, so I made my own Persona 3/4 themed Tragedy Looper cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is like a combination of Quantum Leap and Groundhog Day.  The game is played with a Mastermind and 3 Protagonists (which can be played by 1-3 players).  The Protagonists are trying to prevent some tragedy from happening but they do not know what it is, who it is happening to, or how it is going to happen.  The Mastermind is trying to ensure this tragedy does happen while not giving away too much information.  This is because the Protagonists do not have just one shot at preventing this tragedy from occurring.  If they fail during their first "loop" everything is reset and they get another shot (and sometimes another, and another, etc.)

The game really boils down to a deduction game but with a really interesting and fun twist.  The players aren't completely without information.  Each game has to follow one of a certain number of plots and subplots and each of those dictates which roles the characters can have and this set of information dictates their possible loss conditions.  Each time I take an action or something happens in the game it gives the players more information so I need to ensure the tragedy happens while causing as much ambiguity and confusion as I possibly can.  And I really adore those kinds of mind games.

I've, as the owner of the game, only played as the mastermind which is why I'm speaking only in terms of that but I also think the deduction game of the players seems equally as interesting and offers a COMPLETE change of gameplay, goals, and mechanics.  Almost like a completely new game.

The components are passable, not the best I've ever seen from Z-Man, and I'm not the biggest fan of the anime artwork (I like anime just fine, it's just not the theme/style I would have chosen for this game).  But the system is also one that allows for a lot of custom scripts once you get through the 10 that come with the game.  This is a really original and great experience.

RATING: 5
Just an amazing and groundbreaking premise done up in such a overly complicated manner with a horribly explained rulebook. 
This steep learning curve could have been averted with better design...
Needs a complete overhaul on execution and pick up some tips from T.I.M.E stories on this (which is incidentally a game that is far inferior in terms of content)

Edit: Wrote the above before and guess what, I was absolutely right about it. I will probably end up being the mastermind all the time with everyone else groaning at the end about their headaches trying to crack through the murky depths of equation and logic.

But if I do find a couple of others who have the same affinity for this, it could jolly well turn out to be an awesome game

Good entry level game for new gamers who may not necessarily be interested in breaking into board gaming. Allows the mastermind to handle most of the game's mechanics which takes a load off of the things that said new gamers would have to process. Of course, they have to figure out why certain things are happening, but I think it results in an overall more fun and less frustrating experience when they can all collaborate and discuss things with each other instead of working against each other.

I. Love. This. Game.

I think it's completely unique - I've never played anything quite like it.  It's challenging and engaging, though I'll admit that it takes a little while to comprehend just what exactly is really going on.  It also hurts me to play more than one script in a row - I don't think I'd manage more than two!  I've played as both a protaganist and a mastermind, and I enjoy both.

I agree with other comments about the usability - some things are hard to read, and the cards and components are generally murky and dark.  I like the overall Japanese-ness of it all though, the anime theme works really well and if you're into that sort of pop culture you'll recognise alot of familiar tropes.  I haven't made any new scripts yet, but eventually will have to - once you clear a script there's no point in playing it again as the protaganist, and there's only 10 in this base set.

Overall I love this and would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to try something challenging, thought provoking, and completely different!

1-vs-many deduction game with a Groundhog Day premise. Play involves moving characters between a set of locations and adding/removing "intrigue" and "paranoia". The mastermind's goal is to fulfill one or more of his or her evil plots, e.g. a murder: killer and victim in the same location, with unfortunate but predictable results. The game then resets and the other players, now with more information on what plots might be afoot, get to try again.

If they can last a round with none of the mastermind's schemes coming to fruition, they win, but they only get a certain number of loops to do it.

It's easily the best deduction game since Letters From Whitechapel, in part because of the same deliciously satisfying narrative arc: the detectives start knowing nothing and the noose gradually tightens.

The biggest downside is that the components are pretty hopeless. It's a complex game and I'm not sure it's possible to make intuitive, but they failed in small, stupid ways, such as using a hard-to-distinguish typeface for for the paranoia limit numbers. It doesn't feel like a great deal of attention has been paid to the usability.

Love the concept and gameplay. It's a clever challenge of trying to outmaneuver the opponent and (for the protagonists) figure out what is going on. But the "only play each script" once really problematic. It means you have very limited replay value, and makes learning the game extremely problematic. I'm not even sure how we'll teach other groups to play. My rating would be much higher (probably an 8 or so) if it weren't for the replay problem.
Additional problem: The gameplay is really a 2 player game; the protagonists are basically making choices as a group. However, the game is much more fun when there are multiple protagonists to discuss things aloud.

The game kinda targeting niche market. deduction for the protagonists and bluffing+deduction for the mastermind, I already played both sides, didnt really enjoy being the protagonists side coz of lack of information in the early game, but being as mastermind... trying to bluff and deceive the protagonists is what i liked, I lost the 1st game as mastermind and won the 2nd game, very tight as the protagonists really doing great job deducting the posibilities, in the end i'm winning by just a hair. Kinda long if the games turning into full discussion between the protagonist, and mastermind getting AP coz cornered.

The theme itself didnt come from the box, its just anime art with game mechanic, i had to do some naming for the protagonists and mastermind to help the players getting into the game and some opening story why they end with the game mechanic, the in game characters are very2 generic characters (eg. boy student, rich daughter, Alien???) instead of japanese names like maybe Kei or Sakura... definitely an issue need to be improved.

I like the game more after some plays, but this is definitely niche game and not for everyone, art also can turn off some ppl, so I recommend trying to play first before buying the game.

Unique design, a game that takes a while to get absorbed. 
As first time 'Mastermind', it took some time to get my mind wrapped around the ruleset, and to memorize all the roles.

But a brilliant 'bluff and deduction' game which keeps everyone involved and anxious until the last loop is past and done.

If you ever saw Memento or The Butterfly Effect and thought these movies were great, if you ever role-played and are intrigued by time-lapses in your rpg games... get it. You won't regret it.

Really unique game, I take pride of it being part of my collection.

tl;dr: let's just say this is not my bag

I like the idea behind this game, except that you have to work in a team to solve the problem. And as you might know I prefer games that don't involve a co-operative element
Anyhow... People who know this game well and like it probably will disagree with what I'm about to say, but I'm just going to state what this game felt like to me and how I experienced it. For me the game felt like you had to just do a couple of crap shoots and hope you just happen to get the right info you need to eventually solve the case. Once you have some info you can do some guestimations, but since you still don't have enough info to solve the case, you'll also have to just try some stuff and see what sticks. And that doesn't work for me.
So I see why people might like it, but I have no interest in playing this again. Just not my type of game.

A sort of competitive puzzle game. Players start with no information and must try and figure out how to stop certain events from happening across a limited number of time travel loops, gaining bits of information each loop. The mastermind must execute at least one of the possible plans/game-ending effects each loop.

If the players manage to make it through a full loop without any of the game-ending effects triggering they win.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
An interesting deduction game combined with a fairly dull action selection/bluffing game. My first play fell a little flat (a combination of unengaged players and a rough rules explanation) but the opinion of just about everyone else who played it suggests there is more here than I saw in my first play. I'm keen to try again to see what went wrong.

Update: Playing as the Mastermind seems equally uninteresting. Perhaps doubly so as the Protagonists debate and scheme as a group while you sit in silence, trying not to give anything away.

It seems as though the first turn is pretty decisive; end the loop on day 1 or, through little more than dumb luck, have a number of near-essential characters killed off and make the tragedies all but impossible. This seems capable of delivering a great play, or a really mediocre one.

I'm also less than convinced that the deduction is interesting at all; more a case of looking things up and actually having to deduce anything. Sleuth provides much more interesting deduction decisions.

There may be more in later scenarios. I doubt I'll get to them.

Rating down from 5.5 to 4.

I have only played this once, and I feel like this should actually be a 4 or 5, but I am giving it the benefit of the doubt until I play it more.  

I generally like the idea of the game, but what drives me crazy is that rather than trying to deduce a persons decisions like in Letters from Whitechapel, in this game you are trying to deduce from a series of convoluted rules in the way characters behave/move what is going on in the game.  Often if you miss something, it isn't because you made a mistake or the other player outwitted you, it is simply because you didn't realize there was some obscure rule which would have revealed a further piece of information.

I suppose the best way to sum it up is, to make this game complex they added rule complexity, rather than designing a good game which by its nature is complex but the rules simple.

Tragedy looper is a very unique game and I love the premise.  I love the puzzle solving aspect and how much information can be gleaned from so few actions.  There are so many different characters, plots, and subplots to keep track of!  It's a great mental exercise.  My only complaint is that the game becomes a "Princess Bride" situation in the last round after the protagonists have figured out all the details.  Then it just becomes a guessing game to see who wins, but I suppose that's why they have the variant where you can win just by solving the crime.  I definitely want to play this more.

RATING: 10
This game is an incredibly unique gem. I love the 1-vs-3 approach, and the game proves challenging and rewarding for both sides. As the mastermind, I enjoy nefariously plotting to throw off the protagonists, and the looks on their face when they have no idea what just happened. As a protagonist, I take delight in unraveling information and there is a great sense of accomplishment when you figure it all out. It also doesn't hurt that I really like the theme, which can be a turn-off for some people.

I would highly recommend this to people who like logical puzzles and medium-weight games. I can't really think of any other games like it. The closest you get is hidden identity games like Mafia, but even those grow tiresome at times. Tragedy Looper is like an inverted version of that, because although your identity is known from the start, nothing else is (for the protagonists). This makes the game like a modern mash-up between hidden information, anime theme, and Clue.

RATING: 7
Seems really good but difficult to grasp, even after one full game. It's basically a hidden role game, but instead of players having different roles, the mastermind controls several different characters who have different roles and it's up to the other players to try to discover what those roles are based on the events that happen. Pretty tricky.

I just wish they hadn't gone so cheap on the production. Everything looks and feels cheap, including the dull-looking black-and-white reference sheets that players have to look at through the whole game. A whole graphic overhaul would be appreciated and would make the game a lot more appealing.

Update: I've finally had the chance to play a couple more scenarios. This game is better than Time Stories, but I feel like it never got as much attention largely because of a lot of the issues stated above. The production on Time Stories was incredible.

Tragedy Looper is good. One of my friends pointed out that this is one of the only deduction games that makes you feel like you're actually investigating something. In games like Scotland Yard and Whitechapel you're just looking at numbers and following paths based on deduction. In games like Time Stories you're just playing a choose your own adventure story. In Tragedy Looper you have to actually pay attention to every move and every event and then check that against your reference sheet to try to figure out what is happening. When you start a game you don't even know what will make you win or lose until you put together the pieces to figure it out.

That's mostly all from the protagonists side. On the mastermind side, you have a lot of information to juggle. You need to make certain things happen while keeping in mind a lot of special abilities, trigger conditions, timing of events, secret roles of characters, and of course just the basic gameplay of guessing at what moves your opponents are going to make.

So far that is my biggest issue with the game. The mastermind should really have some sort of screen, like in Mysterium, and a sheet for each scenario where he can make notes and have all of the needed information ready. As it stands, the mastermind just has the same reference sheet as everybody else, and it contains all of the information for all of the scenarios.

A really unique experience it just really needs a better production.

A very novel style of game that scratches an itch in between strategy and deduction in a way that few (if any) other games too.

I did have to learn that it is *essential* for the Mastermind player to prep for the scenarios.  Due to the game's natural non-replayability, you need to give each one your best shot and it's awful to make some blunder on Loop 1 that makes your defeat utterly certain, but you have to play through 3 more loops before the protagonists will figure that out.

As an aside, we cannot imagine playing the game with "no table-talk" as it frequently recommends.  Collaboratively solving a logic puzzle is the main draw for our team!

RATING: 9
A really excellent puzzle.  Love this game.  

Only criticism:
It's pretty frustrating to actually convince the loopers to not discuss which cards they're playing, though, even when you (as the DM) give them time to do so before you play.

Tragedy Looper is an interesting game. The premise is that you've gone back in time to "fix" history and avert some tragedy. But there must be some temporal jetlag at play because you don't seem to remember exactly what it is you're trying to prevent, or who the bad guys are. There's a mastermind who is trying to make sure that tragedy happens.

The good guys play through a scenario, progressing over multiple days. If they can make it to the last day, then they win. If bad stuff happens, which could be that all the players die or various other loss conditions depending on the scenario, then the loop resets and they're returned to the starting position... but with a little bit more information about what's going on. There's only a certain number of loops available, after which the players die.

We played the introductory scenario... and it was a little overwhelming. there were a couple of different possible main plots and subplots that could have been in play. Which plots are in play change which hidden roles the the people in the game could be. So you know that the "Doctor" is one of the characters in the story, but whether he's the killer or cultist or something else entirely is something you have to deduce. And those roles are important, as they have abilities that allow the mastermind to muck things up for you and end your loop.

I found all the possible roles and the possibilities that their abilities gave the mastermind confusing. You've got a cheat sheet showing all the possible plots, roles, abilties, etc. but trying to find important information was difficult. Identifying all the ways to lose the game wasn't obvious, for example. Loss conditions tend to be listed in individual role abilities, but are sometimes listed in plots. There's not a "Here's how you lose" area that shows all of those in one place. And trying to figure out things like "How can the mastermind add more paranoia? And is that even important?" meant you had to scan through all the roles and events and look for combos that would allow the mastermind to trigger the loop end. It just wasn't laid out in a way that made it easy to figure out easily.

I liked the idea of the game a lot. Things start going sideways, and you think that is going to be a bad thing... but sometimes that exactly what you need to figure out what's going on and who's who. And there are bad events that happen, like people getting killed, that don't necessarily end the loop. Apparently we're very selective in our definition of "tragedy". The worst thing that can happen, and did to us, is that you end up ending the loop in the same way twice... meaning you don't figure out anything new from the second "end of loop"

The game is fun and puzzly. There's a good bit going on, and it's a bit of a crazy ride. Supposedly the game is meant to be played where players can't discuss what to do during the loop itself... only during the between loop resets... but I can't imagine playing it that way. We were hard pressed to do anything well even with free communication. Without being able to discuss what was going on we'd have been screwed beyond belief.

As the Mastermind it's a lot more strategic than I expected! I expected it'd be more rote, but there's a lot of double guessing and strategic planning. The protagonists' success hinges a lot on how well the Mastermind controls information flow, although there are certainly good and bad ways to play. The rare deduction game that involves actual gameplay strategy in addition to deduction, which is a huge win in its favor.

It is a bit long, and the protagonists could all be replaced by one player, so not everyone might make a useful contribution. I've only played this 4-player so far.

RATING: 6
I like manga art, murder mysteries and 1-vs-many games, but this game was still a bit of a letdown for me. Playing the part of the evil mastermind is hard, and requires a lot of preparation (getting a firm grip on the triggers of the plot, learning the abilities of the characters by heart, etc). It can be compared to preparing a pre-scripted adventure as a dungeon master while knowing that playing it out will not leave any room for error for improvisation. The game itself is not too long and starts with a suspenseful mystery. However, luck (the blind guesses of the protagonists) certainly plays a part in how long this part of the adventure lasts. Once the protagonists have the main roles figured out, it devolves into a guessing (and double-guessing) tug-of-war, which Is not quite as appealing as the first part. Also, only play this game with four players! With two, it is much too easy for the protagonist player to foil the mastermind's plans.

This game is a favorite in my group, many of whom are fans of anime in this genre. Personally, I don't really like the theme, although I can concede that the art is rather interesting. My main issue with this game is that it's a rather abstract game where the theme is hard to grasp. The player feels like he's solving a mystery in reverse. Rather than taking any direction action or uncovering any clues, players are tasked with moving characters around a series of locations to trigger/prevent certain events from happening. 

The issue is that players are only told whether something happened or did not happen, with no other context. I feel that this is a missed opporunity for this theme. Rather than layer on any thematic reason or gameplay, it essentially becomes a giant puzzle of reverse deduction involving an eyewater combination of character roles, plots, and locations. While the characters and plots all feature names which can allude to certain archtypes, none of these are actually explained in the game. The result is a rather dry game which comes down to a mechanical, methodical process of elimination. 

As I'm the only one in our regular gaming group who thinks this way, it must mean that the game is mechanically solid, however, it's not enough to really make me truly interested in what could have been a very flavourful game.

Sublime blend of deduction and psychological warfare; lacks the spatial element of my all-time favorite Letters from Whitechapel but holds its own as a very unique experience and a similarly thrilling,  brain-burning joy ride. Playing the protagonists and the mastermind are two completely different experiences. In terms of table talk (the rules give several options and leave it up to the players to decide), I think the best idea is to have protagonists only discuss between loops BUT to do so without the mastermind at the table.

Hits both marks as best deduction AND best time travel game that I have tried. I may be a little skewed because I just adore the time travel aspect of the game, and the reminiscence of this game to the "Shadow of Memories" and "Time Hollow" videogames.

I like the idea of this game more than I do actually playing it. There's an interesting puzzle here, but the gameplay consists mostly of staring at a crib sheet full of tiny print and playing one extremely boring action card a turn. It seems like a lot of work to do, especially when the first half of the game consists of playing most of your cards almost completely at random.

There are some neat moments when you start to narrow down the perp/victim/crime stuff, as well as some "I know that you know that I know" moments that are pretty entertaining, so it's worth it if you can get a handle on the rules and deduction methodology. I just wish it played a little smoother. Also, it really needs more missions. I think the rules assume more designer skill than most people have in the "build your own scenario" section.

The title says it all. A scenario based cooperative murder mystery with time travel. One player is the mastermind against the team of variable powered anime teenage protagonists. Programmed actions are simultaneously resolved to effect mystery, goodwill and paranoia to avoid a tragedy. If the mastermind succeeds and the protagonists fail to maintain status quo it triggers a quantum time warp to loop back for another go. Clever game with lots of expansions potential.

Tragedy Looper is a mixed bag. It has an inspired premise, but its drawbacks are numerous and severe:

- [u]Not easy to learn[/u]. This is one of the few games I've played where I didn't fully understand the rules/system by the time it ended.  And I wasn't the only one.

- [u]Extremely difficult to teach.[/u] Tragedy Looper requires a master explainer, and there aren't many of those.  Prepare for your players to despise the game (and you) if you don't provide a comprehensive explanation against a solid conceptual backdrop.

 - [u]New players negatively skew the game[/u]. Unless novices are willing to blindly follow the instructions of experienced players - which isn't fun at all - n00bs will make dumb mistakes that favor the mastermind just because the system is opaque.

- [u]Baffling player aids[/u]. They're challenging to decode and digest, and could benefit from a complete overhaul - but I wouldn't even know where to begin.

- [u]Scenarios have zero replayability[/u].  Even if new players grasp the game mechanics by the end of the session, they can't even retry the scenario that they just screwed up.  That's a truly unfortunate design choice.

- [u]Language stupidities[/u].  Though possibly the result of a mistranslation, it's endlessly confusing to have the 'murderer', 'killer' and 'serial killer' potentially be three separate characters in the game.

I want to like Tragedy Looper, but I'll never have a steady group of four players to play it consistently over time.  That's a problem in terms of future willingness to play. I also wonder whether a board game is the best medium for Tragedy Looper. It may be that a different medium would be a better fit, such as an electronic app with a proper interface.

Unfortunately, there is a strong likelihood that this exotic game won't find its niche.  Expect it to hit bargain bins soon - which is typical of most Z-man games - but not for lack of heart and ingenuity.

The most exciting game in a long time!

Time looping to try to avoid tragedy, reminds me of "Groundhog Day", with an evil mastermind - yes please!

Sadly my copy came with 2 marked Mastermind Cards, making the game unplayable without opaque sleeves, or some variant using other markers to designate where the Mastermind plays their cards.

I already want all the original Japanese expansions translated into English, please Z-Man! :)

[b][thing=148321]Haunted Stage[/thing]: (2012)[/b] 7 new scripts, and hints to create more.

[b][thing=148320]Mystery Circle[/thing] (2012):[/b] 10 scripts and new rules.

[b][thing=150607]Another Horizon[/thing] (2013):[/b] 5 scripts, and a new set of roles, plots, and events, with instructions for how to use them in custom scripts.

[b][thing=150610]Tragedy Looper Script Collection[/thing] (2013):[/b] 30 scripts, and 2 expansion characters (Illusionist, and Researcher).

[b][thing=160796]Midnight Zone[/thing] (2014):[/b] 6 scripts in a beginners set with everything needed for a Tragedy Set, i.e. Basic Plots, Subplots, Roles, and Incidents.

This is easily my favorite deduction, and I love the game's asymmetrical nature. Normally I'm not much for one-vs-many games, but it works incredibly well here, especially in a full four player game (less so with three, and with two the game loses quite a lot as there will be no table talk at all).

I'm was blown away by how heavy this game is, it's a brain-burner. As the Mastermind you have to think kind of circularly, and it's tough. I may create some cheat sheets that lists the Characters, their Roles, their Abilities, any Incidents that affect them (whether as the Culprit or Key Person), and the Plot rules. Just to have it all on one single sheet. Now you spend so much time searching for all the information on your play aids.

The Script creation rules are well thought out and explained, and even without them there's so much to explore in this box that you will be playing for a very long time.

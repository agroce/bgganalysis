Stress!! I love how everyone has to plan and work together to get patients cared for and love how it is timed. The app is perfect for this game! My kids and I seem to be pretty good at this game so we are going to step it up to the expert level next.

Well-produced, semi-real-time dice game.  I kinda liked [b]FUSE[/b], but this went a little out of my comfort zone.  The planning and co-op elements really left me cold.  The app integration was minimal, and that was fine.

RATING: 7
Quite a silly cooperative game :). You are doctors in a hospital trying to cure patients. The gameplay is easy enough: you have a handful of dice and from the rolled results you have to combined series in order to cure ailments. There is a timer too, you have exactly one minute do this. There is nice app counter to this game. Besides curing the patients you will have to maintain the power in the generators, so the hospital does not lose energy. At the beginning of every turn cards will pop up, which will mean usually bad things for you. Overall it is a nice game.

A really good real-time game for folks that don't like real-time games. For folks that are usually too stressed by real-time elements, this game is nice in that players have as much time as they want to talk strategy before a round. However, then players roll their dice and have one minute to place all of their dice in order to try carrying out those plans, and that minute goes by quickly! So, it strikes a good balance.

I also really enjoy how many things the game throws at players. The goal is to treat all of the patients in a certain number of rounds, but the game also throws other various emergencies at you, some of which you can kind of sort of ignore, but may come back to bite you if you let them linger. Focus on those emergencies too much, and you'll lose due to not treating the patients. Focus on them too little, and the emergencies will pound you. Another really nice balancing act.

Overall, a good amount of difficulty and pressure without being overwhelming for folks that might usually shy away from real-time games.

Bought this expecting a frantic and exciting game, but what I received was a boring plan-a-thon. The game is broken up into "planning" phases, during which you can sit there and discuss exactly what is to be done/prioritized, and 1 minute "action" phases where you roll the dice and assign them to accomplish goals. What this leads to is lots of boring "oh well I guess we should do this first" followed by 1 minute of constantly asking what kind of dice are available, and then back to upkeep and planning. I would have greatly preferred a constant real-time game, like its predecessor FUSE, but bought this instead after an internet random suggested it was just better (yeah maybe if you're one to need a nap after any amount of stress). Overall would not recommend, the decisions are boring and usually obvious, and the real-time component feels forced rather than being an interesting game mechanic.

Better than FUSE. Sure FUSE plays really fast and this game took a long time, but it was interesting. It required thinking both quickly during the rounds and planned out in-between rounds. We really had to communicate and plan what we would/should do. And it has a theme even if it makes no sense. Still it's a timed, dice game: I don't like these games because I don't like the stress of timed play, it makes it too hard to concentrate and hold/move pieces steadily, and generally stress ruins my fun. Still, this game is absurdly difficult and the settings are set too tough.

A more complex Fuse--have yet to determine if this is a positive or a negative.
Initial thoughts from a solo play, it seems like the game would be more preferable with more players to mitigate dice roll luck, but that being said there is still only 1 minute to place ALL dice, so more players could make this tricker to keep up with.

2-5 players? Not great with 5 players? By Kane Klenko. Real-time co-op dice game. Based on FUSE. Much more susceptible to quarterbacking than FUSE, especially during Countdown phase.

RATING: 5
Of two minds on this one, but the more I played it, the more negative I became.

Gameplay is pretty self-explanatory. Plot, roll the dice, quickly deliberate and prioritize, rush and repeat. I find that this is more of an exercise in frustration than anything else, though. 

Dice are the epitome of random, and trying to figure out what you want to do with that random when nobody rolled anything associated with what was planned is...ugh. Mind you, I play with a nearly equal assortment of individuals that operate on opposite sides of the brain. With a game like this, there is little reconciliation with that merciless time limit. Sure, you could change that time limit, but we would either just argue more, or it would come to the point where it would be unacceptably easy. No middle ground.

Despite that vitriol, I cannot rate this any lower than what I have. It really is a great co-op concept that will truly resonate with some groups. I see it being worth playing. However, I need to put mine on the block for something our group would enjoy more.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (August 2017)

I like Fuse, so I was expecting a good game, sadly, I was sorely disappointed by Flatline: A FUSE Aftershock Game.

The rules of the game aren’t very complex. A friend explained them in 15 minutes. Playtime is around 50 minutes.

The game´s components are good, the dice look amazing and they are the best feature of the game.

I like the theme.

I was expecting a tense game like Fuse, but in Flatline: A FUSE Aftershock Game there is almost no tension. Every turn you have one minute to place your dice and this part of the game is fun and tense, but all other phases are dull. In the other phases you resolve what your dice accomplish or you plan how you will use the dice. This new iteration of the game adds some pretty standard and vanilla coop features to Fuse. The game´s decisions seem obvious in the planning phase but within the chaos of the rolls and the small time to put them in place some mistakes are made or some positions cannot be filled due to luck. 

Fuse is a tense but simple game, perhaps the extra complexity hurts Flatline: A FUSE Aftershock Game.

Inside the box, there are some Fuse promos. In general, I dislike when publishers do this because they make me buy a game to get the content for the game I really like (and many times I already had the game before like Notre Dame and the Castles of Burgundy promos). Still, I can attest it is an effective plot as I bought the game for the promos, and after playing it, I sold it, but I kept the Fuse promos.

Bottom line, I was expecting a better, tenser, funnier game but Flatline: A FUSE Aftershock Game disappointed me. It has much less tension than regular Fuse and it adds some complexity and a lot of playtime for a lesser experience. I would play it again to see if I missed something, but my desire to do so is low. My SO didn’t have much fun playing the game either. Mildly boring game. I already sold my copy of the game.

Played this at a convention. It was easy to pick up and mildly entertaining. However, it was perfectly forgettable.  First, the pressure of the game did not come from the interesting choices but rather from the timer.  At its core the game requires you to match symbols on the board with symbols on your dice - thus, the basic tasks of the game do not require a very challenging puzzle to solve or very interesting choices. However, there is some strained excitement by virtue of the timer.

*圖版拼好，圓盤放中間，緊急卡洗勻放一旁，緊急骰放對應位置，病人版塊洗勻根據人數跟難度選取對應張數蓋著，抽四張分別放在圖版的四個對應位置，圓盤指針鑽石格指向任何一個病人版塊的下方左邊第一格，放一個能量方塊在充電區，使用對應人數的電力表板塊，上面擺滿能量方塊
*每人選一個顏色骰，拿六顆，一顆放一旁，一顆收回盒中(2人以下用七顆)，單人遊戲同兩人規則只是一個人操作兩色骰
*遊戲進行多輪直到勝利或失敗，每輪分成八個階段
1.失去能量 移除電力表最左邊一個能量方塊，沒得移就輸了
2.根據電力表目前最左邊沒有方塊的數字開對應張數的緊急卡，橘色的差在橘色區空格，藍色的差在藍色區數字最低的空格，藍色區如果六格插滿會形成第二列，如果藍色區12格全部插滿新開不管藍色橘色都移出遊戲，要抽卡不夠抽就把棄牌洗勻在抽
3.丟緊急骰 小到大依序執行藍色緊急卡效果，同數字的先執行下方，兩骰點一樣就只執行一個數字
4.規畫  玩家討輪等下行動，可自己選擇限不限時
5.行動倒數 計時一分鐘，時間到或所有人放完骰結束，玩家先一起丟一次骰，之後就可以同時放骰到緊急卡或病人版塊上，根據對應限制，病人卡一列如果沒放完會清掉，骰子一放就不能拿回
>病人卡有限制只能一個玩家放或是剛好兩個玩家或是任意數量玩家，或是所有人到要放，如果有兩個單人則代表要是兩個不同玩家，上下的符號代表兩種皆可
>玩家可放骰到充電區，只要放滿對應人數格就可以拿對應能量方塊放到電力表
>玩家可放一顆骰到重骰區，之後可重丟任意顆骰一次，此區根據玩家人數有限制格數
6.結算卡牌 橘色區的卡只要沒擺滿需要的骰子就翻面移動到紅色區，如果滿到對應人數就輸掉，如果有擺滿則放到綠色區只露出最上方綠色格，此區的卡隨時可使用後棄掉，上限4，不夠擺就要使用或棄掉，藍色區的有擺滿就棄掉，下列如果清掉就把上列的下移
7.結算病人版塊  從鑽石箭頭只到的病人版塊開始，順時鐘結算(此順序只是方便，如果觸發放置清理版塊可同時結算放完的病人版塊)，每一列如果擺滿就放清理版塊蓋掉，如果全部蓋掉則結算此時黃色中央箭頭指向的對應格，然後清掉病人卡開新的放
8.結算充電站 有放滿就把能量方塊放到電力表
9.轉指針 全部結算完且所有骰返還對應玩家後，中央輪盤順時鐘轉一格，鑽石指針指向順時鐘下一個病人版塊的左邊第一格，如果板上有封鎖版塊就移除
*玩家如果清掉所有病人版塊就贏

Real time co-op game that is a lot of fun. There are plenty of moments of high intensity as you race the clock to treat patients and everyone takes a deep sigh of relief once the round is over. Components are nice quality but the board(s) seem larger than they needed to be. Communication is key as there simply is not enough time for an alpha player in this co-op. It is a neat, well executed game that is very underrated at the moment.

I spotted a copy of this in the Geekway library and had to grab it to try it out. A cooperative real-time dice placement game where you all are trying to treat patients. This is a predecessor to Fuse which I found to be an extremely difficult game. This was much more forgiving once you got a good strategy down of how to stay afloat. If you are looking for that super tough difficulty, it looked like there were ways to increase the difficulty pretty easily. Numerous rushes of 1 minute chaos with short breaks in between. I am not a huge fan of real time or speed games (not that I'm bad at them), but this was a hit!

Flatline is a real-time coop game where you roll dice and cooperatively assign them to various tasks to save patients and prevent bad things from happening.  One nice aspect is that it alternates between timed and untimed, so you can coordinate your strategies before the timed phase starts.  However, I felt like the strategies were fairly uninteresting.  There are bad things that you always want to avoid, and the patients either cause good or bad things to happen if they stay around.  So, cure the patients that have bad things coming up, keep the patients that have good things coming up.

The interesting part is that there are several tasks that require dice from all players, and once you put your dice down you can't move them.  So sometimes all but one player will commit to a task, then the last player will realize they already used the die they needed.  But for the most part, it felt like an exercise in efficiency where your goal is to just to prevent the bad things from happening and then make sure you use all of your dice.  I like real-time and I like coops, so I enjoyed it.  But, I would rather play [thing=38453][/thing], [thing=123096][/thing], or probably a few other games before Flatline.

A fairly bland reimplementing of Fuse with poor art design, a confusingly awful insert, components that don't feel good or intuitive to use, and a stronger reliance on luck because of the long-lasting effects of bad luck as opposed to the fast-paced nature of Fuse.

Really fun game. The ease of play is really strong here. Setup and tear-down are fast, and the game can be explained in just a few minutes.

My only issue is that the game seems almost impossibly difficult. I've only played a few times so far but I haven't came close to winning, even on the easiest setting. It feels like in addition to playing well, you need a lot of luck with the dice in order to succeed. This is made worse by the fact that you can usually see that you won't be able to win within the last few rounds. Based on how many patients are left, you can see that there just won't be enough dice to cure them all in the remaining rounds. I'm considering not using the timer every other round just to see if the game would be winnable.

Still, I'll keep playing because the game is so fun and easy to play. Just hoping to eventually pull out a win.

Absolutely love Fuse and it's a firm favourite with the gaming group, so this is a no-brainer for purchase. Slightly worried that this time, there's patients on the line!

Chaotic, fun and totally crazy game of dice rolling with time-based cooperative element. The custom dice look very good.

I do like this game, but after playing twice, I wonder how it could possibly be won when played as intended. My group played it without the timer (to avoid the added stress) and barely scraped out a win on the easiest level.

Co-op real time dice chucking in one minute waves matching color patterns to treat patients on the space ship hospital while neutralizing random event card threats.

Learned to play under the tutelage of Kane Klenko. Lots of player interaction. Lots of decisions to make, and not enough time to make them. Really takes the alpha gamer out of the equation. If you enjoyed Fuse, but wanted more, then this is the game you want. Highly recommended.

Like many other real time games, this one can get to be pretty hectic. For some reason, it seems harder than it probably should be, but it's still enjoyable to lose.

Hectic dice placement timer based game.  It's cooperative, and you'll be yelling quite often at your friends.  Even the easy training mission is a challenge the first time.  Nothing really special here, but it is somewhat fun to play.

So far, I like FUSE better. This game has so many more decisions to make, and I like that. However, FUSE was very streamlined, and this is a bit fiddly.

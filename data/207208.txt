This feels like a very tight little game that went surprisingly under the radar. Bidding is interesting - a one time bid where no matter where you land it's interesting choices (well, not if you were last). Theme is pasted on, but I definitely don't mind having picked this up from a Queen fire sale.

Advantage of playingin later/last is just too important. Scoring tiles kinda broken. Killing raiders appears to be way too dominat too....

*6* (Initial plays)
Post apocalypse game that has a good blend of mechanics. The game is brutal and enjoyable at the same time. The bidding portion of the game makes for a difficult decision but the rest of the game is rather ordinary. The set collection is basic and the buildings are rather simple. For a game of this weight I would kind of like it to play quicker. Still enjoyable, just not all the time.

RATING: 7
Interesting game about survival.  The auction mechanism for the round is a lot of fun, as you can end up with lots of "bad stuff" happening if you don't pay attention.  The brutality of the zombies attacking can really set you back and make it hard to recover, as the problems can compound really quick.

Overall, a fun game.

If anything, this wins the award for "game that you'd guess is AmeriTrash, but is squarely Euro". There are no "thematic" events in the game. Thematically you need to get workers and fight  marauders, but it's just getting new meeples (in 3 colors), and build buildings, which both provide space for workers (you can't keep more than you can house), and provide abilities for your workers. The core mechanic is actually an auction where you spend workers as your bid. Or three parallel auctions. One for turn order in selecting of the available items, one for turn order in selecting of the available buildings, and one where your bid is simply the set of workers that you will put to work doing stuff. The "stuff" that they do, is unfortunately rather bland. I.e. the systems don't really interconnect to result in interesting plays. There are a few good building combos, but you only get one per round, and don't know which will be available each round. The items don't actually do anything during the game. They're just for end-game set collection VP. So overall, I like the auction, but it's surprisingly dry for a game called Armageddon.

Its just mediocre. You can Its a little bit like behind every good thing in game comes one bad.Betting could be fun, but its done badly in terms of blocking and defeatings your foes, that have had turn before You. Buying survivors is fun, but collecting equipment is not (its an euro, but you cannon count 1/3 of your opponets point until the end of game. Buying building is cool, but on a side You also need to take completely random +or - tile which means, that whatever you are doing, sometmes you opponets gets pluses two rounds in a row, while you get two minuses. Building a city and using the actions is cool, but on the other hands the our Survivors not doing much stuff in dependence of colour. Its like "yes, maybe a little bit, but who cares". Idea with scoring tiles (after 3rd round, after 6nd round and one from our hand at the end of the game) is good, but they are not very well balances, so you can get shuity tile with scoring for special type of building, while your friends will get some easy tile with scoring for every equipment card.

This could be very solid games. Its even a little bit fun to play in, but there is plenty of better titles.

Armageddon is a solid auction game where you bid with your workers which you also need to do stuff in your city. So, the more you bid, the less you get done in your little part of the world. The game throws marauders at you all the time. These guys try to damage your city and cost you victory points (VP) in the long run if you don't deal with them. On the other hand, they can also be a VP source. So it depends on your overall strategy whether you want a lot of them or you avoid taking them. On top of that, you try to get some endgame points by collecting sets and and by satisfying open and hidden scoring cards.

The game itself reminded me a lot of Homesteaders: By buying various buildings you kind of commit to a certain type of strategy. Whether this is fighting marauders, collecting cards, getting straight up points from buildings or any other way is up to you. Pick your path and try to build a good engine that supports your current strategy.
But all in all, Armageddon did feel lighter than Homesteaders. Because you don't know the order in which new buildings and merchandise turns up, Armageddon has more of a "go with flow" feeling than Homesteaders where you can plan a lot more. Not that there isn't planning involved in Armageddon. The more rounds we played, the more I understood that you basically have to have a rough idea of what you want to do in a given round before you commit to your first bid. While you still don't know what your opponents will do at this point, you should already have a plan for your city. The workers that you need there won't be available for the other auctions. You can even push your luck at this point and try to consider the building you might get this round. While this aspect was fun, it also slowed the game down a lot because of the AP it induced in me. But all in all, I enjoyed the planning aspect.

What I didn't understand was the player order. If we played it right (didn't read the rules), the player with the most points is always the start player and then it goes clockwise around the table. Why isn't the order decided by the players current position on the VP track? I don't know if this would change a lot, but it still felt like a missed opportunity.

Some people seem to be bashing at the theme of this game and call it an abstract but I can't really understand this. The actions made kind of sense to me in this setting and I could kind of see a thematic reasoning behind the basic turn structure where you basically assign your worker resources to different tasks. The more people you assign and the faster you are, the better the results will be. But I'm not a theme guy anyway, so what do I know.

To sum it up: I enjoyed my one and only play of Armageddon and wouldn't mind playing it some more. If I had to rate it today, I would give it a 7.

This was way more enjoyable than I thought it would be - probably because I won.  But seriously, they really did well at integrating theme and mechanics.  Somehow, it just all clicked for me.  I don't see it working well for only 2 players, so I'll never buy it, but for a group, it's pretty darn good. I hope to see more plays.

Played a demo game at UK Expo - I quite liked it. It has a bidding round that resembles Keyflower in that you are bidding in workers to win things and possibly to allow the workers to take actions. However the auction is not quite as good/interesting as that in Keyflower and I also preferred the way Keyflower builds up your settlement rather than the card-row in Armageddon.

Not a bad design and I would certainly play again - a little more theme engagement would have been nice but for some that won't matter.

Comment:
After a short introduction I was sold on the game.

The combination of bidding and worker placement is interessting and offers some hard choices to make. Theme and mechanics are very evocative for a Euro-style game and fit well imho. You really "feel" for the fate of your little post-apocalyptic colony.
The artwork and the general quality of the components are fantastic.
Really looking forward to the next play-session.

A great game and one of my two highlights of Essen '16!

Update: Yes, the game punishes the players, but in a positive and theme-fitting way. That might sound strange, but I never had so much fun losing disastrous :D
Apparently everyone associates completely different things with the shape of the player markers. For me they look like skulls or heads with gas masks...

$12.43 on Amazon; this is a GREAT game. You are the mayor of a settlement trying to survive by recruiting more people, housing and feeding them while trying to fight off marauders. Has a cool auction/worker placement mechanic and a finite number of rounds so it doesn't take too long.

Queen games-hez képest kicsit bonyolult és elég mély játék, egyáltalán nem rövid játékidővel. 2 óra körül kell számolni egy partyra, ami QG-től meglepő adat. 
Nagyon jól sikerült elkapni a poszt apokaliptikus hangulatot, sokszor reménytelennek tűnik visszaverni a támadásokat, ellátni minden emberünket, és közben talán még kicsit  előrébb is jutni. A központi licitálós mechanika elég nehéz döntéseket indukál, főleg annak akire hamar kerül sor. Talán a végpontozó lapkák egyensúlyán lehetett volna még kicsit dolgozni, de ezt leszámítva élvezetes, jó hangulatú játék. Gémer(ebb) társaságoknak ajánlott, nem a szokásos QG szint.

Colour me surprised that so many people seem to think the setting comes through in this title. From my point of view Armageddon shows one of the most obvious disconnects between setting and mechanism I've seen in a good long while. It looks like accountants will be in dire need after the apocalypse.
Anyway, the centrepiece of the game is a recurring auction that determines player order for the different phases of a turn. Since you bid with your workers, the more you bid the fewer workers will be left over to actually do anything that turn. Interesting trade-offs and all, although with typically similar numbers of workers the valuations are fairly coarse; small differences, big effect, stuff like that. The visual design could also use some improvements. I've got two bigger issues with the game, however. One is that the auction is pretty much the game but only takes at most a third of the game time. The overwhelming rest is spent with administrative tasks, managing various tracks and assigning workers to buildings. The second is that the scoring seems rather wonky, with end game bonuses varying wildly in usefulness, and equipment cards as a major source of endgame points suddenly running out (possibly a balance problem with 4 players).

Now this is really a mediocre game. While it's not bad, it doesn't do anything really well. The cover looks great, but once the game is laid out, you are looking for the theme that is shown on the cover.

The game is light and while it has some good ideas, there isn't much depth. The different colored people sound very interesting, but the game didn't take advantage of that idea. Instead there's only a single part in the game where you need the colors...

Could have been a great game, but the actual one is not.

Meglepően bonyolult játék a Queen Gamestől. Poszt apokaliptikus játékban egy városban a túlélőket irányítjuk. Az embereinkkel kell három helyen licitálnunk. Az első helyen felszerelésre és új emberekre licitálunk ( a felszereléskártyák, egyszerű szettgyűjtögetés a játék végi pontok érdekében), a másodikon épületekre licitálunk, ahol akciókat tudunk végrehajtani. A harmadik helyre tett embereinkkel tudunk a városban dolgozni. Minden helyen az első helyezett jutalmat, az utolsó büntetést kap.

A fosztogatók állandóan jönnek, ezért legfontosabb akciónk a fosztogatók visszaverése, mert ha nem sikerül a kör végén sérüléseket szenvedünk, az pedig pont levonással és embereink elvesztésével járhat. A játék állandó küzdelem 6 körön keresztül, végig úgy érezzük mást nem csinálunk csak a fosztogatókat verjük vissza. 

Nekem nem jött be a játék hangulata, hosszú és monotonnak találtam a játékot.

Thankfully I only payed about $12 for a new copy of this, because otherwise my disappointment would have been greater. Queen games, at one point was good, but I feel ever since they released Dark, Darker, Darkest(2013) their quality of games(not component wise) have severely been lacking. 

I played this game once, and knew from the get-go I would not play this game again.  In Armageddon, players are tasked with building up their fortifications and gain followers during a post-apocalyptic setting, by gaining resources, through cards, buildings etc. and get beaten the least during the game. The premise is fine, but the game lacks in many areas. During the game you are constantly driving off marauders, who will force you to lose points, your leader, etc. every round, which will become annoying. You can circumvent this by dedicating workers to do base actions and fight them off, problem is every turn you auction off said workers to get first pick at items and buildings as well. Plus it doesn't help that items will grant you more people to your base, but will sometimes have marauders attached(all workers randomly drawn from a bag) which will in turn increase the amount you need to fight that turn - not to mention every round it will gradually increase as the game gets closer to ending. So you have to choose to get a very useful building, an item, that is merely used for set collection bonuses end-game, or dedicate a certain amount to use the actions available to you on your board.

First off, why are items only used for points? Seems rather silly that having two shotguns in my hand gives me 3 points at the end of the game, why couldn't the cards be multi-use like in Covert, where i can discard it to fend off marauders? It would make the game more palatable and give more choices to the player, and more importantly make sense! In my one play session, I had a player literally dedicate all his workers to doing base actions and forego getting first pick at items and buildings because he was so high on the marauder track.

Also I noticed a huge flaw in the game. I was dead last with only 14 points, while my friend who was doing the best had 57 points, both of us prior to end game scoring. I had a scoring tile that granted me 4 points for every liquor card I had in hand by the end of the game. The liquor card has a set bonus of 16 points if I have 6 of them, which I did. I got 40 bonus points from that. Then the round track had a scoring tile that granted four points for every Engineer in my colony(yellow meeple) and I so happened to buy a building that converts all my generic(green) workers into yellow or blue(soldiers)...I had 12. So because of a tile and two cards I scored about 100 bonus points, not to mention the other scoring tile and card sets in my hand rocking from 14 points to 136, in one round. That is ridiculous. Lords of Waterdeep sort of has this big point score swing end game, but every player can benefit from this, and even still can win if they didn't.

The issue is, you can forego playing the game, and just collect cards, and keep spamming buildings like the library that give you more card draws, because there isn't enough variety in the items, building or scoring tiles, in this game, meaning every game will be just as samey as the next. The game includes only 24 unique building and in a four player game, you will see at least 20 of them, every time, which poses a problem because people know which building to shoot for to score them the most points. Same with the end game scoring tiles, which each player gets two of. One thing I hate about any game, is lack of variability, and this game has it in spades. Plus some buildings will generate a ridiculous amount of VP per turn just for having it built. 

The game started out ok, but just turned into a slog of getting beat by the game, but in a quick turn around gaining over 120 VP's in a matter of seconds just from two factors. The game could of been great with more variability from the get-go, more use from item cards, More choices to give players that result in more unique games and less super swingy point generation. As is, it goes on the trade pile.

I wish it had a better feeling of building something. The equipment cards where very abstract and game-y, instead it would have been interesting if you could discard them for taking out marauders, upgrading buildings or something. Made a critical error in the first round, and the rest of the game became a pretty boring chore with almost no choices because of the downward spiral effect. Meh. artwork is great and components as well.

Armageddon is a contender for the biggest disjoint between theme and mechanics. Everybody expecting an apocalyptic ride, will be disappointed by the central auction mechanism driving a tactical system of set collection and VP optimization.

The mechanisms are solid, the parallel auctions are interesting although not the tightest. Bids are coarse-grained due to bidding with a limited amount of workers of which players should have a comparable numbers. Armageddon is a fine mid-weight tactical euro that will suffer from the unfitting theme.

It is an average game and with set collection.
Bid with meeples and defend defend defend.
Everytime counting on the score track, damage track and marauder track, is a bit tedious.
You get in the first auction maybe a marauder, so adjust the marauder track.
One player gain the green reward (bonus) and one player the red (malus) and again adjust the tracks.
Second auction, again green bonus and red malus and a token bonus or malus, tracks need to be adjusted.
Then transfer the meeples to your own city board.
Now, many meeples are needed to defend the city against the marauders (the track) and normally you have no option to skip this.
After this, you need to count the score point.
And btw. transfer the marauder (track) to damage track.
Check the damage track for every round.
Count the meeples and the buildings with beds and check the score maybe.
After this all, prepare the new round with new marauders.

Pleasantly surprised by this one. It's a worker placement game with a weird auction/area control aspect that works quite well. You have to "bid" on each of the three areas, but you get a penalty for having the lowest one, and you also choose rewards based on how you place. A lot needs to be weighed, as some cards could have detrimental things added onto them. You always feel like you're behind the eight ball, and are constantly struggling to keep up. 

Such an interesting, tight design. One of the very best in Queen's catalog. Only downside is the maintenance between turns, which can be a touch too fiddly.

I feel this game is very underrated.  I love the way the bidding mechanic works.  Essentially you split your workers into three groups:  The scavengers who go out looking for equipment and survivors, builders who build new structures, and everyone else who will take care of things at home such as manning the watch tower, running the headquarters, etc.

The game can be pretty brutal.  There are as many ways to lose points as they are to gain them.  You have to make sure to keep the marauder track and your damage track under control.

RATING: 6
One of the more heavy Euros out there; not in the league of Dominant Species or Kanban, but lot's of hard choices and optimizing. Not prone to analysis paralysis. The setting -- a post apocalyptic day after world -- is fresh and the implementation is actually pretty good for a Euro: You commit survivours (workers) to collecting stuff, educate engineers, defend the settlement from marauders and so on, but don't think of classic worker placement! It's more of a worker bidding game. On the first glance, it seems rather interactive, but then again, it isn't really possible to directly do harm to each other except for the well known conception of blocking and taking stuff that someone else may need. 

For the friends of involved mechanisms, however, there is bad news as well. You can't completely analyse the game. Strategic planning? Not sure. No full information, secret individual scoring objectives, and there were complaints about some halfbaked elements, e.g. play order. Some point sources seem ridiculously undervalued. There might be a game breaking Hunger strategy.

So, from the thematical aspect alone, this one is pretty convincing for its genre; the mechanism maniacs will see the need for some minor tweaks. I didn't find it boring at all (honestly), but it didn't excite me too much either. I have the feeling that this Armageddon is one of those games that get some attention right now, but I don't believe many will remember it after, say, 5 years. Give me the choice and I'll go for like 50 alternatives most of the time. But: It may fit the role of the occasional 2 hour Euro.

RATING: 5
The gameplay of Armageddon centres around a clever auction mechanism which has shades of Keyflower. The currency used in the auction are survivors, and you send them out each round to bid for equipment, buildings or to be sent to work at your base. The neat twist is that you have to shelter your survivors too – or have them rebel – which adds an additional consideration to how many survivors you pick up. It's not a super-thematic game, but the mundaneness of the post-apocalyptic life is a decent fit for the mechanisms.

As a whole though, the game is a little wishy-washy. The auction system invites a fair bit of downtime at the start of each round as players divide their survivors among the three auction piles. The weakest point though, would be the use of straightforward set collection via the equipment cards. Having a sizable chunk of VP come from rummaging around the equipment deck feels a bit cheap. Even worse, the publisher seems to have made a questionable change which makes it possible for the equipment deck to run out. Overall – an interesting concept, but the game could have used more polish.

I was happy when the game ended. I managed not to manage the track, that one which should have been managed in order to avoid cumulative damage. Other players did that better and they gathered substantially more points and were maybe more happy after the game.

Love this game. Just like a real post apocalyptic survival game you always feel you are under fire but you slowly pull away and everything comes into place. I recommend this game

Rating based on a half game demo Play at Essen.
Nice auction mechanism with action and set collection combined. Works surprisingly well thematically without adding the obnoxious "Z".

Rating might go up with further plays

Auction game with a bit of worker placement: You place a number of workers to bid for buildings and the remaining workers can then use the buildings you have to score points. Not bad but not exciting.

Good take on the post-apocalypse theme in a Euro game. Hold off the raiders if you expect to win.

This is a terrific game, with a well implemented theme, especially for a eurogame. At its core is the central bidding mechanism, but the game also includes worker placement, and set collection as two other important aspects. The game features excellent rules, and iconography. This is a thrill to play. It's all wrapped up in a very nice package. The bidding, worker placement, and set collection somehow just comes naturally together.

I'm a bit surprised that this hasn't caught on with more players yet.

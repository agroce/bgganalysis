I think the map is grotesque and the rules obtuse. Sadly, it doesn't scratch my substantial Great War itch. The good news is there are plenty of other games that do.

I want to like this one. Like many Clash of Arms games, it's very attractive. The subject matter is a real interest-killer though when trying to pitch it to potential opponents. A WWI tactical game? Isn't that kind of boring? The whole point of the game is that there was a lot of interesting stuff going on, but it's a hard sell, and compared to WWII (SL, ASLSK, CoH), the latter games have more obvious appeal.

RATING: 5
Tried to play it, but it's hard to get into a game about guys charging trenches.  The tank rules are complex and the tanks always break down so it hardly seems worth the bother.  Simulation for simulation's sake, where are the game play decisions?  I have never had much interest in games which are more about simulating than about fun.  Never became the "Squad Leader of WWI" which I think it was aiming for.

Has very nice plane and tank counters though, useful for the Jules Verne variant for GWiE.

RATING: 7.5
This is the ‘Squad Leader’ of WWI, portraying accurately the tactics used a century ago. Each counter is a platoon of men, cavalry, each vehicle symbol is one tank or truck or an artillery piece. The box contains 4 modular double-sided map boards, a dense rulebook and lots of counters. You just read enough rules to play the introductory scenario then go on with more page-rules to proceed scenario by scenario. This was not an era of flexible manoeuvres. The innovation and use of the deadly machine gun blocks such expectations even in game play. The scenarios although historical are usually one sided; the harsh battlefield reality of WWI. Anything used at the battlefields is represented here in detail. A nice tactical WWI wargame simulator. 

For more flavor look for the expansion ‘Infernal Machines’ 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating is based on limited plays, and may change over time. This looks to be a very nice game- a bit like Squad Leader set in WW1. 

This game sets out to do a lot, and it somehow manages to do it all quite well. 

The game offers a unique perspective on WW1. It's not just a stalemate of facing trenches. Zooming in on the trenches, Perry Moore shows us that there is a mobile war going on at the tactical scale. There are interesting decisions to make every turn, and the gameplay is tense.

The rules do contain a few problems here and there, the worst of these being the rule for Becoming Unspotted.

RATING: 6
Solid WW I tactical wargame that emphasizes the "toys" (aircraft and tanks) over the infantry.  Portrays the change in technology and tactics as the war progresses generally well.  Clash of Arms does a marvelous job with the physical portrayal.  Even though there are other tactical WW I games out there, this remains a benchmark game.

Just out of shrinkwrap.  Looks nice ... quite a bit of reading. Got the full colour Central Powers counters referred to in the Forum - yup, not consistent. [BTW, a fellow BGGer did provide a scan of original CP infantry counters ... which printed out on gloss photopaper look much nicer on maps than the "new style" ones.)

disappointing... the subject of this game is, imo, one of the most fascinating in the history of warfare and the designer/developer/publisher missed the opportunity to give the players an opportunity to know why. Simply stated: the rules are a mess, the c3i inexistent, some stuff is overcomplex and other not considered at all...
great graphical rendition of maps and counters.
nevertheless I play it, and still play it today (a lot of homerules...).

Probably my favorite Clash design.  I like Perry Moore's stuff-- always on interesting topics that not many people design games for.  LANDSHIPS is a hypertactical game of warfare in the trenches of WWI.  It plays faster than ASL, and is a lot less complicated.  Wonderful graphical approach, too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
My first impression (and it is only that) is that the treatment of machineguns (the heart of WWI tactical combat) is very wrong.  They have the same movement as infantry platoons, and are actually better at close combat.  Silly Germans, no need to create Stoss tactics, just send your machinegunners across no-man's land!  The sequence of play--which allows no defensive fire against the second leg of an attacker's movement--also looks questionable.

RATING: 7
Look like a winner for a tactical level WW1 game(urrhhh...yes, it is about WW1, not WW2 ASL). The game was released in 1994, more than 10 years ago and thus attracted quite a few followers.  In fact, I've just seen only one game on this WW1 tactical level so far. A realisitic simulation of what happened on the ground of WW1.  Trenches everywhere and tanks appeared the first time.  The subtitle of this game is tactical innovations.  So you'll see a lot of action involving a variety of weapons together.  Players should try to maximise the use of each weapon's strengths in some sort of coordination.  But you'd soon find their efficiencies are low and slow, rendering a combined- arms operation virtually a theory on paper only.  A "traditional", earthy and sturdy but resourceful design from Perry Moore.  The sequence of play is complex with 12 phases for each side in a turn.  Some of the phases are joint operations (air combat and close assault).  Although the pages of rule is less than 20, the actual game mechanics is not as simple as it seems.  The style of rules writing is also somewhat disorganized with little cross reference, a signature where one wants to pack everything inside a cabinet.  There are too many acronyms.  You just have to flip through the pages sometimes to get what they are about.  There are a dozen scenarios to choose from and a lot of nations are involved, including a scenario on Turkey vs. British in Ramadi Iraq, 20 miles north of Baghdad.  There are several good pieces of historical commentary written by the game designer himself. Overall, it's by far the best Perry's game and a game that worths every of your hard-earned penny.

Probably Perry Moore's best work.  Very colourful WWI tactical game. However, I would never play this without Arnaud Bouis' alternate CRT on Web-Grognards.

The system is a sometimes annoying pile of fiddly little subsystems (and some advanced/optional rules that have the opposite effect of the original rule), but covers a lot of ground.  Looking at the 24-phase turn sequence, one can't help being impressed by the design elegance of someoen like John Hill and think "this could have been done simpler". Unique product given its scope.

RATING: 5
A bit of a dissapointment. The theme is excellent and the historical notes are some of the best ive ever seen, the production is absolutely beautiful but when it comes down to it the game just doesnt seem FUN. Id say it comes down to the fiddlyness (the turn sequence, the lack of status markers and the awful spotting rules) and the CRT. Every attack either does little to nothing or it completely elimates the unit. Even tanks are either eliminated in one hit or entirely unscathed, both frustrating and unsatisfying in my opinion.
Landships is also yet another wargame which suffers from an extremely loose rules set... Those spotting rules are a complete nightmare.
On the plus side some excellent quickstart rules are included which can get you playing the game in half an hour easily.

RATING: 5.5
Easy to see the appeal: this is the real-world incarnation of games like BattleTech, Ogre, and Warmachine. The historical notes are a blast to read. I can live with the loose ends in the rules and unbalanced scenarios, but the lack of basic marker counters (for keeping track of units that fire, etc.) drives me crazy. Most of the system is also driven by d6 rolls, which I particularly dislike in tactical games because the range of outcomes is so narrow. The spotting rules are a nice idea, but functionally unworkable. In short, it's a messaround game, not to be taken too seriously or put under a microscope.

The quick start scenario, by the way, is fine for teaching the basics of infantry fire and movement but the simplistic artillery rules that are in effect denude it of any period feel.

RATING: 7
Not great but not at all bad, either.  Artillery seems far too powerful and complicated, too.  Maybe arty *was* that pivotal in WWI - I don't know - but it does little for the flow of the game.

Rules are a mixed bag; actually fairly well written and easy to assimilate, but too many important bits of info are scattered around in odd locations.  This is not a deal breaker but it makes learning & playing more of a chore than it has to be.  Tanks are really the coolest part of the game, as they should be, and they are modeled in an interesting and in what seems to me to be a fairly realistic manner.  They break down a lot, and some tanks can "wander" off course - the player moves their tank and a few die rolls to simulate hard-to-steer vehicles will indicate where the tank *actually* trundled off to.  I thought that was a simple but cool way to model this.

The charts & tables are a bit of a handful, as there is a lot of info jammed onto a single card which is a bit much to make sense of (and I play ATS, so umpteen playaids on the table is not a foreign concept to me). The maps are simply outstanding, though, and there are lots of them, too.

RATING: 7
The rating us based on my initial thoughts of the contents after opening the box.
First off the dice are random, the D10 is just a normal black D10 however it would have been nicer if the D6 actually matched rather than looking like something from an 1960's board game.

Then the rulebook, well it's hardly a book, just a number of pages folded over and stapled together with all the writing inside being way too small making the reading uncomfortable. The illustrations there are, are poorly done as are the diagrams. Inside the rulebook the scenarios are stapled to the middle pages which isn't ideal.

After removing the rulebook we get to the table/chart sheet which is printed on yellow card which once again is difficult on the eyes.

The counters come out next and they are very, very poorly done and very small. I can't understand why the Central Power counters are coloured in yet the Allied are just blue counters with the outline of the troops, crap!

Then comes the maps, which are OK but not fantastic.

Like I said, this is just based on the contents, hopefully the rating and comments will be better after I've played it, but it isn't really worth the £35, it's more like a game that would have been given away in a gaming magazine a few years ago not really worth much more than £10.

Updated now I've played twice, it seems a great game to play and I really enjoyed it

Very good game on an under-represented subject (WWI tactical games) in wargaming. Solid design, not too difficult on the rules front, but lots of the scenarios are high counter density affairs, leading to somewhat lengthy games. Even better when combined with the Infernal Machines supplement for some Russian Civil War and Chaco war action.

Very good topic, always adored the era. Basic rules are simple but they allow enough room to invent new ways to reach the goal. (for ASL and Fighting Wings -player at least) Game runs smooth and keeps both parties busy. Spotting rules are some degree of horror but Infernal Machines saves the day. Spotting is excellent idea itself. As fire tends to be devastating once it hits, it is just matter to play a bit of hide and seek. As all out assault against enemy machine gun posts will deliver expected results, something more devious has to be introduced.

Not there best looking game, but this is a blast to play. Choice of text is questionable, should have been larger. Overall, not too difficult of a system. Reminds me of GDW's Trenchfoot, not a historical simulation but a great experience none the less. THE definitive Beer & Pretzel game.

RATING: 7.4
As tactical WWI wargames, there aren't a whole stack of them out there. It's the tactical aspect of this game that interests me. Even at it's best, WWI tactical combat was mostly relegated to "over the top" charges and was mostly static from 1915 on. Still, this one throws out a few interesting scenarios using WWI innovations and tactics that seem interesting. There's a support website for the game and it was released in a 2nd edition by CoA

I really enjoy this game. I have to say the draw is the almost infinite re- playability of it. I can whip up home brew scenarios - or if I am lazy just modify one of the the many that come with the game. Add some gunboats to a game with a river on the map - add airplanes alter the time line (play 1915 games in the 1917 and add arty and optional rules). And the combat rules are not difficult to learn. One comment though: I would dearly love some spotted markers to get track of the units spotted. The rules are on spotting are a little hard to grasp although the designer has good cause for them. It's just trying to keep track of who is and who is not spotted that's hard.

I only managed a few scenarios, but found it just wasn't working for me. I think it was the sequence of play that caused me problems as it renders ineffective the fire and movement tactics used during the war. Maybe a revisit with house rules is in order.

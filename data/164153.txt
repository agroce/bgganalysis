I should have known that games that require a dungeon master are not for me. Couple that with lots of fiddly rules and multiple aspects to keep track of with no real rhyme or reason, and you end up being one of the most dissapointing games I've played in awhile. I want to like this game, but its like the really cool looking bottle of wine or beer with a cool label, yet tastes terrible and leaves a bad taste in your mouth.

What I did like: the maps and minis. 

Everything else in this game either requires learning too many rules that aren't intuitive or waiting through significant scenarios for meager rewards. It's not as deep as the Star Wars RPG's I grew up playing, and it's not as fun as battling with the Star Wars minis. I'm sure i'm in the minority, based on the BGG rating, but this game just isn't what I thought it could be, and wasn't all that fun.

Updated Rating: 5 - Dated 2017-03-10
I am starting to soften on my stance with this game. Originally, I had rated this at a 2, but that was unfair. It was due mostly to having played the game (campaign) with two different groups, where in one, the DM was very unfair, leaving out explanations of rules, and not working very hard to correct obvious mistakes we made as Rebels, the other being a group where the two other players (one the DM, the other the Wookie) seemed content to have their own in-jokes, and own RPG-Lite going on, irregardless of me, or the campaign we were playing. That soured the game for me.

I updated the rating to a 4, because it was unfair to judge the game on the players I played with.

After having restarted the campaign (this time as the DM) with a group I enjoy playing with, the game is fun. But what I've already stated about fiddly rules are still true. The rule book comes out once a scenario, even after multiple plays. There are some things in the game that don't make intuitive sense, and in some cases, detract from the theme. 

I will, however, keep playing now that I've got a good group to play with. I'm also hopeful that the eventual app fixes some issues with how to build and maintain a campaign, and that the rules come a bit more naturally after multiple additional plays.

EDIT: updated rating to a 6 after playing many skirmish missions. This seems to be the "best" mode of the game - although the rules issues still plague this version of the game as well. If I were to make this game over, I'd strip out half of the rules requirements. Battles should be seamless and easy (similar to Memoir '44, for example).

Just bad. I don't like Star Wars and this game was just a mess. Every mission boiled down to "body blocking". Too fiddly, bad rules (4 rulebooks, SERIOUSLY?), just didn't like one part about it. Couldn't finish one full game.

[thing=164153]Imperial Assault[/thing] (2p skirmish, 2-5-player campaign, 1-2 hours per mission)
There are two games in the box: the campaign game and one-shot skirmish mode (with 6 scenarios). After 2 skirmish games and 9 missions of the campaign, the game has been everything I have expected, although because this is the first game of this type to us, it should be easier to exceed my expectations.

Imperial Assault is extremely fun to play and the missions are varied (not just killing). A campaign has at least 11 missions, half of them side missions that vary between campaigns (random draw and rebels choose one from the 2+ available). The different weapons (attack dice) and defenses (defense dice) allow push-your-luck moments, and sometimes the dice are on you side and sometimes against you. You have an overall strategy, but the game is played in a very reactive, tactical way due to the alternating activations.

As the imperial player I cringe when I see the level-upped rebels take out my stormtroopers in one shot before they even get to activate on that round, but if the rebels take too long killing my troops, they neglect their objectives, and I come out on top again. And the rebels are not the only ones that get to have new abilities.

Also: I have painted the miniatures. Even a quick paint-job will make the game look amazing. (Unfortunately for a painter, every painted game needs to look better than the previous one, so a good job takes quite a while. Well, at least painting is a good peripheral hobby to go with boardgaming.)

It is fun after spending 10+ hours to learn it. Hate the manual design which is not new player friendly. And the overwhelming content still scared off lot of people.

Didn't like the dependent on the overlord and all the surprise on the campaign guide. Questionable the replay value per the mission. Any how, it is fun, which is what the value counts.

What a waste of money in my
Opinion. I am a diehard Star Wars fans, TRPG DM & Player for years, and enjoyed both strategy and dungeon crawl games. I saw the reviews and the beautiful components, then I thought I must get this. I even paid more money to get expansion characters such as Han Solo and such.

I have to say, the only think I like is the miniature scuplys. I got the game for a few years and the user manual itself scared me. It was not well written and confusing, pointing you to jump from page to page. Surprisingly, the much more Harvey TRPG rule books were much more clear and good read.

Some might said that the game is very simplified. Indeed to compare to TRPG or hardcore streatgy. But I was hoping this game to be more simplified. To me, I think this is too complicated. If I have the time to play this, I might as well play TRPG. If I want good strategy, I might as well play Shogi or Eurogame, which simple yet with depth. If I want to play dungeon crawl, I would just go for D&D Advemture system anytime, which was simple enough to be customizable to make it more fun.

I played my first game of this with colleagues. Just figuring out how to rebuild the tutorial map took us such a long while. It felt like I played a puzzle building along with reading boring confusing rules to desicpher complicated code. Most disappointed game for me so far, as I have had high expectation...

I Love this game, it is Star Wars in a box.  My problem with it lies in my playing as the Imperials.  My play group takes a significant amount of time to plan out each of their turns, this works well for them but it means a typical round is: Rebels take 10-20 minutes per player, imperial takes

The only game that I have painted the miniatures for. That should show how much I enjoy it.

The joy of Star Wars distilled in a box. Many adventure games and dungeon crawlers can become over-full of book-keeping and die-modifications, to the point in which it can feel exhausting. Some players greatly enjoy this aspect of gaming. However, it just wouldn't feel right to have a Star Wars game with the same sort of barrier to entrance. I think Fantasy Flight has done a wonderful job of streamlining the dungeon experience and creating a game that heavily suggests the feeling of a Star Wars skirmish. The amount of gameplay and longevity is also incredible, supporting a campaign mode with enough story and progression to feel depth, as well as a fast-paced skirmish mode that is great for little one-offs. The support for the main game, through miniature expansions, is also admirable and the amount of content you receive in cards and skirmish scenarios justify the price and show that Fantasy Flight is creating win-win situations for the company and for fans.

Another move and roll game.  Didn't seem to have any meaningful decisions, but this is based on only one play.  Also (blasphemy) I'm not that into the Star Wars theme.

RATING: 7
Thanks a lot FFG for yet another crappy rulebook. Sure, it is true that the system has been streamlined from previous generations of dungeon crawlers (Descent and Doom), but the way it is presented to the players is rubbish. The rulebook has an onion structure distributing all essential information of a rather simple game over tens of pages.

Another weak point is the infinite levels of pain the setup induces. Sure the game is beautiful but the search for the right bits and pieces is a quest of abysmal frustration. Oh why could not you just make a pile of generic pieces instead of individual ones.

In the end we got sick and tired of the setup and trying to find the information we needed. Without giving it further thought we covered the gaps in the rules with our own and quickly grabbed a bunch of troops and cards to play with. Once the game finally started, it shone like only a star could. Take my word with a grain of salt though. After all those brain burners, a fast paced dice fest always welcome to my table. I do not mind if the game does not offer the cleverest of mechanics as long as offers a retreat to another universe.

If you fancy a game calling for deep thinking, skip this one. You will just ruin the experience with your analysis. But should you enjoy quick decisions based only on your intuition, you might find Star Wars Imperial assault a rather refreshing experience.

Star Wars (Check). RPG{ish} (Check). Miniatures (Check). Likely to have plenty of expansions (Check). This is on the fast track to becoming one of my all time favorite games. 

I Can't wait to play it again.

7/1/15 - I had to re-rate many of my games because IA raised the bar for my collection. It is the best game in my collection. It has been a hit for my wife, my gaming buddies went crazy for it, and I find that I can't get it to the table often enough to make me happy. It is the best game I own, and one of the best on the market right now.

I still can't wait to play it again.

I love the Star Wars theme.  This game is a 1 vs many game, where one player will play as the Imperials and the others play as the Rebels.  As the Empire, you will build your faction with various tools at your disposal.  The Rebels have a series of characters that will gain abilities as they advance through the non-linear story that is determined by several cards.

Where X-Wing drops you into the cockpit of iconic Star Wars snubfighters and Armada puts you in command of entire fleets, Imperial Assault takes you right down to the adventures on the ground that are so central to Star Wars. Both sides are incredibly fun to play, with the ragtag band of heroes earning experience and accomplishing missions while the Imperial player deploys all the might of the Empire to stop them. Definitely one of my favorite games right now!

The box is also two games in one, and the skirmish ruleset is nothing to sneeze at.

1st plays: This is a refined version of the Descent 2.0 system with a better theme.  I really wanted to like Descent, but the hand of take-that cards always felt jarring, and the long turns caused it to drag a bit.  Threaded actions and less gotcha's speed up the game and make for a positive experience.  I do wish there were more Jedi/Sith though.

2nd plays: We played this multiple times in one night, and the campaign was interesting, each scenario was different, and not quite the frantic pace of Descent.  It's still a race to complete objectives, but slightly less so, and still a very tight margin for error.

I bought this to play with my two boys.  I wasn't sure how well it would work since my boys are so young (6 and 8) but it has actually worked out great.  We played through the tutorial and they really liked it.  We are currently 8 missions into a campaign and we are all having a good time.  I play the imperial side and they each play a hero.  To make it be more fair I haven't been spending my XP or Influence, but they have been spending their XP and credits (which they really enjoy).

FFG could have very easily taken the lazy rout and just slap Star Wars pictures recycled from their LCG on Descent and they would have made back more than their investment. I don't mean to sound cynical but that is exactly what Hasbro has done (for years) with Star Wars Monopoly or Star Wars Risk. FFG has shown love and care in this game, and it shows from the countless of flavor text written everywhere from the rulebooks to the hundreds of cards and the overall reworking of a tried and true game system. To put it bluntly: Imperial Assault is far from âDescent, but with Star Warsâ. It is a perfectly streamlined and designed game that takes classic design concepts and mechanics and refines them to one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had.

Dungeoncrawler in space with Star Wars theme. 

Now weÂ´ve played three missions on the core set campaign and itÂ´s soooo good. The battle keeps swaing back and forth and its almost always up to the last turn to see who wins. 

This is RPG in boardgame design, the miniatures, the story of the campaign and the levelling up system and the fact you can upgrade your equipment. 
Simply amazing. HavnÂ´t given it a 10 yet, but that is mostly because we havenÂ´t finished the campaign and IÂ´m afraid it gets a bit repetitive. But I donÂ´t see that happening right now.

Este juego me enganchÃ³ desde el principio. La temÃ¡tica es Star Wars Â¿quÃ© mÃ¡s se puede pedir? Pues se puede pedir que la caja bÃ¡sica estuviera mejor organizada por dentro porque es una vergÃ¼enza. En EspaÃ±a, el precio del juego es 100 euros. Comparado con "zombicide: black plague" o "blood rage", la organizaciÃ³n es decepcionante, siendo necesario preparar insertos para almacenar el material.

No obstante, y pese a esto, tiene la mejor mecÃ¡nica de juego que mÃ¡s se ajusta a mis gustos. Las partidas se pasan volando, es rejugable y adictivo. Las miniaturas son buenas y algunas tienen partes deformadas que se corrigen con calor, pero se pueden pintar bien. Cuesta recordar todas las reglas y exprimirlas pero con 2 o 3 partidas es suficiente.

No he jugado escaramuzas. SÃ­ el modo campaÃ±a, tanto de imperio como de rebelde. Se disfrutan ambas aunque el juego parece inclinarse por dar ventaja al bando imperial.

Jugadores: 4 o mÃ¡s (si falta alguien para completar los hÃ©roes, entre todos se controla).

Best Dungeon Crawler ever. 
A "must have" for every SW fans.
A "must have" for every dungeon crawler fans.
Revolutionary in its core, not oriented in slain mob, rather in complete objective before a deadline. The struggle between master-empire and rebels-players is full of tension. 
Very deep in its genre. Requires teamwork and sacrifice to claim victory.

Just started a campaign.  We're two missions in.

I only purchased this to have a "Descent" like game in my collection.

We are really enjoying it so far, but I suspect the rating will go down after the newness wears off.

According to a buddy of mine that has played quite a bit of Descent, the games are virtually identical in their core mechanics.

This isn't getting to the table with the frequency I was hoping for, so I traded it away to someone in the gaming group for another game I've been wishing I had in my collection.

I feel like too much of a fanboy because of this but...whatever. I wanted something that was similar to a dungeon crawler that allowed some bits of a story with more fighting and strategy. It needs to be quicker and easier than D&D because of the type of people I wanted to get involved.

After just one day playing through a couple missions, I can see why this game is so popular, and why Star Wars fans are living in a bit of a golden age of board games.

Uses well-tested mechanics from games like Descent or even the FFG Star Wars RPG to provide an entertaining Campaign or Skirmish experience. A bunch of missions included right in the box, and the miniatures and other components look fantastic. Firing and melee rules are simplistic, and the opposed die rolls help to mix up what might happen during a combat rather than being a 100% sure thing. The line of sight is easy to follow, and Strain and Wounding mechanics help the Heroes feel...a little more heroic than the Imperial mooks they face. Dat AT-ST though. Pain to put the gun on the nose, but damn does it look good.

It's... okay.  The theme works better here than it did for Descent, because it is a tactical squad game with objective-based victory conditions.

One complaint I have is that melee weapons (lightsabers aside) don't make sense in this setting, so why does my wookie have a polearm?  Also, the Jedi was having a hard time damaging a computer, so we looked at her stats... and she is wielding a quarterstaff.  Where is her lightsaber?!  You don't infiltrate an Imperial facility armed with nothing but a bonk branch.  It's goofy.

Amazing game! Fast, simple and addictive! Skirmish is great and the fact that I can play in that option without explaining a lot to a new user is great. Campaign is brilliant!

Imperial Assault is two games in one. With a Star Wars setting. And wonderful miniatures. What's not to like?

At its core, Imperial Assault has the same engine of Descent 2nd edition, with some small tweaks. The most important, in the campaign mode, is the alternate activation of a hero and a group of villains: it creates, at the same time, quicker turns and lots of tactical tension.

The campaign mode looks like it will be my preferred gaming mode, but skirmish is somewhat appealing too... two great games in one!

If you're only going to invest in one game to represent Star Wars in your collection, this would be an excellent choice. A medium-weight game with fantastic components and steadfast support, Imperial Assault will no doubt have everything you love about the Star Wars universe before it's all said and done. What I really like about this system is how quickly and easily it plays (it's essentially a fairly simple tactical skirmish game) and yet the campaign mode provides a grander context to draw you in. Super streamlined and just plain fun!

Rogue One in a box, basically.  Which to me is awesome!  Once you get the rules, the combat system is clean but has a ton of options with skills.  We have had some epic moments when I played through the campaign - even to the point of having the very last mission come down to one action in one turn (if I as the Imperial side had one more action, I would have won!).  I really like that in the campaign, both sides get to upgrade and have advantages, to the point that you can give the Rebel player(s) a great experience without holding back as the Imperials.  I haven't played skirmishes yet, but I can tell they are a lot of fun.  There are a lot of great options, choices, and a ton of wonderfully Star Wars models!  It's an excellent system, and the dice rolling is fairly random, but it usually ends up feeling more epic than frustrating.  I really do love this game.

I am really impressed.

I played a demo in Essen and the game felt kinda...meh.

But now after I played the full game and three scenarios in a row I can say that FFG have learned a lot from Descent 2.0.

Now what is really better and what make IA (up for now) the best Overlord crawler to date - sadly, I do not enjoy them that much today.

1.) Hidden information - Rebels will be surprised in every mission and the old DOOM/Descent 1 tabletalk is back!

2.) Mission style are (up for now) really different. Defend a base, strike in to get secret plans without getting wounded, reache goals in a sepcific number of rounds [so not only rush missions here!!!)

3.) Nice combination between skills (rebels and Imperial player)

4.) Interesting campaign system with a good story focus.

5.) Theme - Descent 2.0 felt kinda flat for me but this game really rocks!

This is a cool game. Very Fantasy Flight with nice minis, counters, chits, cards, more cards, smaller decks of cards. (Seriously 29 decks of cards!)

Modular map is nice, though it adds a bit to setup. (I tend to enjoy the map construction, so it doesn't bug me.)

Plays well. At this stage I've only played the first couple and they are quite balanced. Keep your eye on the objective and you might eek through. If you don't your opponent will reach theirs first.

Normally I don't really enjoy thematic, dungeon-crawling dice- and combat-heavy games.

But here I can really connect to the theme as a fan of the franchise. And I think it really helped that I got to play in skirmish mode where players have a duel with evenly strong armies and some clearly defined mission goals.

My rating most likely would have dropped a point if I was playing a scenario mission against an overlord â because I don't really enjoy that type of gameplay.

UPDATE: [6.13.17] - I love the Star Wars universe, and so many thematic elements of this game capture the imagination and scratch that RPG itch.  However, the strategic depth of the "meta" is thinner than other games made for the same IP or dungeon crawling style of game.

Worst game in existence. There  is not a single game rule in this game, that is well thought out or balanced out. The game is heavily one sided by design, which means half of the game content is there for the sole purpose of inflating the price, without any prior notification of it being so. The money would be better spent burning, that at least warms you for a couple of seconds, this game gives you nothing

Found this by sheer dumb luck, everything you do is dependent on you. There's no one to blame except your self when you lost: but no worry, analyze what you did wrong and improve your strategy next time. Throw in some ally/villain packs and SW:IA can nearly hit infinite replayability in both campaign and skirmish game

oh btw I never played Descent, so I just learned all the rules from scratch, it's not as daunting as it looks

and me being a Star Wars fan definitely helps a bit too

I like games that tell stories while also being mechanically interesting. Imperial Assault is such a game for me. The following only concerns the campaign mode and is mainly from the viewpoint of the "dungeon master" who controls the Galactic Empire.

In itÂ´s core, its a tactical shooter, meaning you have to position your guys tactically and strategically on the board. Selecting the order in which you activate your units and their positioning is crucial. The line-of-sight system allows you to sometimes block important figures from being shot at. Units are represented by miniatures that are fun to paint and I would highly recommend you do that.
In most scenarios there are some triggered events that happen either at fixed points in time or when the heroes do something specific. This maintains some level of surprise for the hero players and keeps the story going. The players quickly try to play around some potential bad situations like opening a door with the last action and being surprised by a squad of stormtroopers.
I think the units and their abilities enable a relatively deep tactic game although you also need some luck when rolling the dice. I donÂ´t mind the luck-factor since it also comes with many moments of tension/joy/small frustration that make a game engaging.
Most of the scenarios are close and come down to the last action in order to determine the winner. The possibility of upgrading your characters with new weapons and skills together with the continuing story motivates for the next game and keeps it interesting.

I would say I like the game for the same reasons I like X-Wing the Miniatures Game. Both are set in the same universe, both use dice as well as cards that represent units and describe their values and abilities, nice miniatures and a tactic movement aspect. The big differences are the number of players (2 vs. 2-5), the grid board vs. no grid, the turn order (sequentially vs. "simultaneously") and the fact that one tells a story from beginning to end.

A touched up Descent with a Star Wars theme. I'm more invested in Descent than IA, but it's a pretty strong game. I especially like some of the units that we haven't seen a billion times in Star Wars media. I'm not sure how wise it is to own when I already have Descent, but I hope to get it to the table more someday.

Very enjoyable dungeon crawl within the Star Wars universe...what's not to like.  My only gripe is that the game favors the imperials so much, and they have more forgiveness from bad dice rolls.  But everything else, the campaign style, the upgrades the variability of the characters make this very enjoyable.

I am only a few missions into the campaign, so this may get more balanced as the campaign progresses.  If this changes, I will update my review.

this game plays similarly to monopoly. except there are no properties to buy, and you attack each other's pieces. this game is fun. for maximum enjoyment, consider painting the pieces and ordering 3d printed components. there are a lot of pieces and mechanics. definitely not a casual game as you will need a group of dedicated people for a campaign.
definitely not recommended for a small child.
 the worst character by far is saska teft. imperial guards are too good. r2d2 is worth. i think it is more fun than getting a root canal. also there is no jar jar figure sadly. otherwise i wouldve given the game 10/10

After playing the core campaign as Rebel player and lost mission after mission I have to say it is not really balanced. In the FFG forum and other social medias the Imperial player or the Rebel player outmatch the other totally. And I played the tournament system but was also not really convinced about the balance. You can just play a Stormtrooper Squad of 16 miniatures and as Rebel you have puny 5 miniatures in a skirmish with the same command points. Guess who wins?

Imperial Assault has the campaign game for one. The campaign can be great fun. It feels like Star Wars. Its a great group adventure. On the other hand the game is really not that interesting regarding game mechanics. Decisions are simple and straightforward and the game master has to compensate for this. If he/she is doing a good job then its great. If not its just a really simple "move and shoot/roll dice game" with some problems in the mechanics.
The skirmish mode: Okay is nice that they added this, but: Its to easy for a compelling tabletop. The messed up the balance and asking 10 Euros for one single miniature and some cardstock, because "Star Wars" and "Disney" are printed on the product is too much.

After playing through two full campaigns, I have decided this game just isn't for my group. Too often, the game suffered from bad die rolls; many times, people played tactfully, consulting with each other as a team, and then just got hosed on the rolls. I know that's the point of these games, but we just did not find it as fun as we hoped.

The game is dripping theme, though, and many of the missions felt the way they should from that perspective. The story quests, and the characters specific missions were tense and satisfying most of the time. It was the dull filler missions to get to the final battle that left us wanting. Not a bad game, just not for us. 

Willing to trade.

This is a hard one to score.

I enjoyed painting the minis following the excellent Sorastro painting series, however the game itself has hit the table once... ever. It takes forever to set up, the rules are a bit 'picky' and not very intuitive. Admittedly though, I hated Zombicide and other 'dungeon crawl' type games, I just thought Star Wars would pull this from the dust!

The Star Wars-ness though is awesome, and you can feel the love poured in... That being said, the base set is incomplete in terms of miniatures, FF missing out many of the vital components in favour of just putting in a cardboard token and trying to get you to buy 'Wave 1' a handful of minis costing nearly the same (or even more?!) than the whole base set.

Imperial Assault is Star Wars Descent: the only downside is, you canât switch sides and play as the Empire against the Rebel GM/NPCs. But I guess it might be fixed easily by an expansion or home variant.

Initial Impressions:
-----------------------
First off, the components for this one are amazing.  Everything just does an amazing job to say "I'm Star Wars" and it really makes the game feel thematic.  The scenario system is pretty cool, and makes each campaign unique, and this will improve as they add more character packs + big box expansions.  

The LOS is still not perfect, but its an improvement over Descent 2e.  I like that they removed stupid things like traps, but made the Imperial "building up" still interesting.  

The game is still a bit "Gamey" and in fact, the team on the clock so far in my games has always lost, with only one of them really being close.  Still need to play more, and read some FAQ stuff to make sure all this stuff was legal ( I am pretty sure it all was ).

I really enjoyed my plays, and even after playing all day, I wanted to keep going, however the system still has some issues.  I probably had too high of expectations, and while I still think X-Wing is the better Star Wars game, this one is still amazing, and I look forward to years of playing this one!

I enjoyed this one but one of my gamer friends hated it and made the whole experience miserable. I will concede that any game where one of the players has to 'hold back' is not particularly well balanced. Along with the fiddly rules this is not as good as hoped.

Best dungeon crawler there is in my opinion. Campaign is really good, I think it is better for rebel players then to Imperial overlord (it sucks to play 1v4, no one to share your happiness and sorrow). Expansions bring infinite replayability to this game, and when we add skirmish, we get such a power house it is not even real. I think I could play that skirmish anyday.

In the middle of a campaign with friends. It is pretty jam-packed with a lot of stuff. Perhaps my favorite mechanic so far is the campaign scenario generator. My least favorite are the weird line-of-sight rules. 

The game itself is fairly snappy once you start playing. Put-away is the most fiddly part of the game as you put away cards and sort decks.

I wonder if the system will ever flip with a set such that the Imperials are running their own "Heroes" against a Rebel "Agency?"

Update: There's a lot of little things (decks, principally) to keep track of. This is pretty confusing for me if players want to play more than one battle at a sitting. I do like that battles are mostly short-ishâon the two-hour range.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Getting the same 4-5 ppl together over many sessions can be a challenge for the campaign, but still a great experience for star wars fans. Can drag on the campaign if one side keeps winning and gets all the upgrades, so manage that if you are the imperials. Always play with max heroes, as that provides the most interesting strategic decisions for the rebels.

Very long preparation before each game. Side missions are inbalanced with no indication so you can choose hard mission at the beginning with small chance of sucess.

This is the first dun-crawler I have ever played or owned. It has inspired me to do the unthinkable: paint my miniatures. Don't buy this game if you are not a Star-Wars Fan, it reeks of theme. Easily the best "Bang for your Buck" big box game I own. Incredible amount of super high quality components. 

UPDATE:
I now own the Chewie and Hahn expansion packs and have been able to play as the Imperial mastermind. What a fantastic game! The ability to play shortish missions and an over-arching campaign has changed me...or at least the standard I have for what is deemed an amazing game. 

...THANK YOU FFG! I'm buying this for my Brother...

I have now played several rounds of the "skirmish" game. Far & away the most popular non-rpg game among my friends. Bump to 10.

The setup can take a while, but after half a dozen plays or so, you've probably worked out a good system so you know where everything is and can find it quickly.

I've mostly played the campaign as the Imperial player and this game came pretty naturally to me. I was able to crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke ... thus terminating my cousins' desires to play this with me. You have to be ready for some tactics if you play this game, and you have to STICK TO THE MISSION! Don't get side-tracked blasting stormtroopers. I, personally, find the run-and-gun type of mission much more evoking of the Star Wars theme than a more combat oriented game where the goal is to wipe out the opposing Imperial units.

The skirmish mode is nice to have. It's a fun little diversion, but having played WotC's Star Wars Miniatures game and currently owning Star Wars LCG and X-Wing, I think I have enough games that require customization before you play. What this game lacks in the options of the old Star Wars Miniatures games, this game makes up for in mechanics. I like that each skirmish game has random mission objectives so you are trying to juggle between wiping the other force out or getting mission objectives. It feels very innovative to me and I really like hat aspect. If I didn't have so many games like the skirmish mode, I think I'd be way more excited about it.

I really wish I had a group of local dedicated players to go through the entire campaign with. I get stuck being "the bad guys" most of the playthroughs and it honestly kinda kills it for me. I am aware that there are "auto bad guy" variants but having tried those with Descent, it just feels like too much of a chore. 

If you like Descent but your group doesn't do the whole "dungeons and dragons" theme, this is a good way to get a taste of that with a more popular and mainstream theme (Star Wars).

The best of the Doom/Descent games.  I think they did a nice job conveying the theme and feel of the Star Wars universe.  I enjoyed my plays of this however I don't plan on buying it.

Paid $43 from Barnes and nobles during 50% sale. Play campaign a few times to see all core set missions!
Best add ons: Villains; Royal Guard Champion, Hired guns, Han or Chewie: wave 1- no expansions needed. Twin shadows expansion- adds mini campaign, 6 new missions, 4 new characters: tusken raiders/ heavy storm troopers, two heroes (Biv Bodrhik, Saska Teft). Later waves: Obi wan Kenobi. Ally/Villian packs add one mission each. Return to Hoth is a big-box full campaign add-on, better value than Twin Shadows.

When playing two person- one player controls 2, 3, 4 rebels.  If playing 2: each gets a "Legendary" Reward card. It adds +10 Health and both Heroes get an additional "activation token" which means they both get two turns in one round as compared to the Imperial Player's Deployment cards which get only one activation per round.  If playing 3: each gets a "Heroic" Reward card. It adds +3 to Health and 1 of the 3 Heroes (rotating) gets an additional "activation token" which means they basically get two turns in one round. Best balance is if you play 4 heroes though!

Rating based on first impressions of a tutorial mission and a skirmish mission.

Superb components and graphics, excellent theme and interesting game mechanisms. Tutorial mission is a downer since one can basically just run through it but skirmish was fun and you didn't have to wait to use all the goodies that come with the game (as you do if you're playing campaign).

Setup is painful and you really want to come up with a good system to store the components of the game. Rules are also a bit of a mess and it's still quite tough to find answers to relevant questions even though FFG has clearly done a lot of work to prevent rules issues.

I must play more, I must play more, I must play more...

I really like Descent...

...and suddenly they came with Star Wars Descent. YAAAY!! And it even has reworked rules.

For me as a big Star Wars fan this was a must buy.

This box has so much to offer.
I haven't played the campaign by now but I'm really looking forward to.

The skirmish-mode is great. And this is how they lure me into the expansions. In Descent I have no interest in buying the expansions (expect the Co-Op ones) but here, where I can use them for a 2P-Skirmish game? Crap...they got me...

And as a final word.
They even reworked that pathetic Line of Sight rule.

I love it.

Wow. Played two scenarios, and they were both supremely stupid. The figures and art look like Star Wars, but of course it feels like a mindless dungeon crawl because it's just Descent with a new coat of paint. Apparently FFG just got the Star Wars license, realized they need to crank out as many Star Wars games as humanly possible, and said "hey, we've got Descent on the shelf, we could turn it into a Star Wars game with almost no effort". Which is about what it feels like they put into it, at least on the game and scenario design end.

At least the scenarios are much shorter than Descent or Doom. They're dumb, but at least they're over reasonably quickly.

The game system is actually not too bad here. The dice are fine, the surges powering special abilities are decent. The recovery rules are broken, but what the hell. If there was more interesting terrain rules, more opportunity for maneuver, maybe more space to play with, and if the game had been given a non-stupid narrative arc, there might be something here. But sadly those things were not done. Think of some random terrible Star Wars tie-in novel.

At the end of the day I generally dislike FFG's games anyway, so YMMV. If you liked Descent for some reason and are a Star Wars fan, this might be your game :) But it's not mine.

There are a few off-the-wall rules, but the miniatures and maps are gorgeous, the gameplay feels tense, the maps are just about infinitely replayable, the theme/writing is pretty strong, and the abilities add great flexibility.

It is Star Wars Descent. All I ever needed this to be is Star Wars Descent.

I would say there are less differences between this game and the last iteration of the system (Descent 2e) compared to previous new editions (the Descent 1e > 2e jump; the Doom > Descent jump), and I feel confident in saying this is the definitive version.

First, they fixed what in my opinion is Descent 2e's only serious flaw: its broken-ass spawning system. The overlord (Imperial Player) cannot just respawn his biggest baddie the turn you kill it every single time and must once again generate threat (now using a handy wheel instead of tokens) in order to respawn troops.

Beyond fixing what was obviously broke, the next two most important changes, in my opinion, are that the overlord (Imperial player) now swaps turns with the heroes and that the maps are much smaller. These are two of the subtler changes, but they make all the difference.

The turn swap means less downtime generally and makes planning effectively much more difficult (and thus interesting) for both sides, who now have to react in real time. It brings out the psychological warfare of such games better - anticipating each sides moves, etc., is brought to the emotional forefront of the battle.

As for the smaller dungeons... the play space might look less epic on the surface, but really it just makes things feel tighter and more focused. Individual sessions now last the 90-120 minutes they ought, and it's rare that anyone goes a turn without doing anything important or lagging behind.

There's also some other smaller, but hugely welcome component changes that make setup go a good deal faster. No more fiddling about with terrain tiles - the colored lines on the map are more than sufficient (although I will point out that my red-green colorblind boyfriend had no end of trouble with the thin red lines).

The way scaling works for different player counts - beefing up the heroes rather than having a million different versions of each individual monster - also speeds things up and works even better.

The rulebook is also just straight up better. True to Fantasy Flight, we encountered some ambiguities here and there but most everything was covered and the general layout of the rulebooks is excellent. There's a handy index for absolutely everything so even clearing up confusion was a more pleasant experience compared to Imperial Assault's forebears.

The new side mission system is certainly interesting and exciting, although I'm not sure how I feel yet about upgrade paths being tied directly to characters. I'm not sure I'm the audience for that as I would prefer a little more customization. But that's a pretty minor and very personal complaint.

I am a huge Star Wars fan, though I do miss the fantasy theme and would love to see a Descent 3e. But I have to say, this is just an all-around better and cleaner experience out of the box than Descent 2e.

Update: Mostly done with our first campaign now and it's safe to say that this game IS pretty unbalanced, in the Rebel's favor. I understand that it's basically impossible to balance an asymmetric game 100%, but there were some missions (Friends of Old) where it seems like there's no way the Rebels could lose. If the game must be unbalanced, I would prefer that whichever side won the last mission (or at least, story mission) then receives a mission that's NOT in their favor for their next (story) mission.

I think this is in part due to the fact that the Rebels pretty much always have a unit (and thus turn) advantage. After the first turn or so, the Imperial player is usually stuck with 2-3 groups on the map to the Rebels' 4-5, giving them about half the number of turns each round, which can really hurt when there's no "delay" option for the Imperial player.

An expansive game with tons of variety.  It's a lot of fun, although the balance is sometimes off - games tend to be tight, but also incredibly tense in a way that isn't always fun.  Missions are normally time limited, and one mistake by either side can destroy you.  It's one of the better games in its genre and the missions are very fun for Star Wars fans, but it's for experienced wargamers or at least experienced gamers because it's so unforgiving.

I like the idea, but I just have not been able to get this to the table.  The lack of the ability to play solo means that my copy is pretty much sitting on a shelf instead of being pulled out like other more co-op games.

It does not help that the high price mark has kept me from not only looking into expansions for this game, but into other Star Wars based games as well.

I wanted to enjoy this but its another rehash of Descent/Doom. It encouraged analysis and group discussion of optimal moves rather than fun light roleplaying. 

UPDATE: It turns out we got some rules wrong that made it harder than it should have been for the rebels. This could push it up to a 7.

This is the Empire Strikes Back of star wars games.  I have not yet been able to play the 1v1 mode, although I hear it is very good and quite well balanced.  I have been able to get through most of a campaign as the imperial player however, and it is just great.  Bursting out a squad of storm troopers through a door on an unsuspecting rebel feels so good.  Meanwhile on the other side of the table I can see the players plan expertly and make use of their abilities to shut down any weaker play I make.

review from the boy: Everything is awesome in Imperial Assault(sang to the Lego Movie theme)

review from dad: When I was a teenager I found several dozen of the 80s Marvel Star Wars comics at a thrift shop in my hometown for 25c a piece and I bought them all. They were wacky, ridiculous, 'real house of ideas'/Marvel in it's glory days 80s supertrash. It sent me on a several year quest through my teens to collect every Star Wars comic Marvel had produced before the series untimely cancellation. I eventually succeeded, finding #1 for next to nothing a real coup.

Apologies for the aside it was just so I can say that playing IA is the closest I have felt to what my 12 year old self felt(yes 30 years ago) reading those old Marvel Star Wars mags. The excitement, the joy. Tonight the boy's character Mac got to drive an AT-ST. This game delivers on what it promises.

A very fun campaign game with interesting character development and tense scenarios. Nearly all of our plays came down to one or two moves / dice rolls near the end. it was also a nearly even split W/L between the imperial player & the rebels.

i don't have much desire to play the campaign again but if there were totally new material that started where the first mission ended I would devour it.

This is the Star Wars game I have been looking for.  It is epic adventure and brings in all the elements you would want in a SW setting.  The minis look great and scream to be painted.  The missions are fun and relatively diverse.  I haven't even cracked open teh Skirmish game yet but that looks just as fun as the campaign.

It's grand and I own a bunch of the figure packs alongside the first small box expansion.

But I used to play Doom (2004) so I know the system well, and Earth Reborn (2010) does single map skirmishes better, while Gloomhaven (2016) does deep co-operative dungeon play much better.

Imperial Assault is still grand and the newly released Legends Of The Alliance app seems fantastic but it feels like newer dungeon crawling campaign systems may have already surpassed this polished up Doom/Descent engine.

...won't lie though, this is a safe keeper because it's so easy to play and introduce ahead of the heavier campaign games!

Played a full campaign (as Diala) and lost. Not really a game for me. Dice combat feels very swingy and I really didn't enjoy all of the "surprises" which happen once you open a door, complete an objective, etc. I did appreciate the character progression, but it isn't enough for me. I'm still curious about the skirmish mode and would give that a shot, but I'm not running out to play it.

Despite my other geek cred, I am not captivated by the Star Wars franchise. Therefore, the sparkle of this game might not really work for me like it might if you love the theme. Certain episodes that are more-or-less impossible for the Alliance to lose followed by episodes where it is almost impossible for the Empire to fail make this a bit weak, IMO. Each episode takes too long for this sort of lopsideness to not raise hackles.

Rating for the entire game [family=26488]family[/family], which deviates from my normal policy to rate base games and expansions separately. My rating for just the base game would only be slightly lower with a 9, though.
A truly excellent game! I particularly love how they managed to include two very different games which I both love! :)
My rating contains a bonus for the existence of an official, well-organized tournament scene, the fact that the official FAQ is updated regularly and that FFG is not afraid to change cards that turn out to be too weak or particularly too strong.
The game still has one notable improvement potential in my opinion, though: I think it is missing official rules for multiplayer (campaign) missions outside of a campaign (like playing single scenarios in Descent 2e).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I don't enjoy this game very much. It's for two primary reasons: (1) my son is so good at it, and I'm so mediocre, that it's a mismatch every time, like playing chess against a master when you're just a duffer, and this is somewhat further exacerbated by the campaign where you feel like you're having to play not just one game as a fun one-off, but instead a dozen missions of likely losing drudgery; and (2) the game is somewhat fiddly, forcing the player to keep a lot in his head as he's playing, and I don't do so well at this -- reminds me of other fiddly games like Sentinels of the Multiverse or World of Warcraft the Board Game, where you're constantly having to mentally adjust for +2's and -1's before and after comparing every roll. Not so fun -- better for computer games. I completely forgot about an ability for one of my two characters for half a match; on the one hand, thatâs on me to remember all of his several abilities, so I deserve to have missed it; on the other, the more abilities you add the more fiddly things get, the slower the play goes, and the more likely I am to make mistakes. The game lends itself to micromanagement as you progress. 

My son, meanwhile, is nailing the math so fast that he already knows what dice to root for on defense. I sit there trying to remember who has Pierce X, plus that Old Wounds means I do one less damage each roll, but that Savagery means with those guys he does one more each roll, etc. Maybe it's partially that I'm having to handle two full characters with two activations each (two player game, where I'm Rebel) -- maybe if I just had one character and was teamed with friends playing one character each, that would be more fun and less fiddly and unfunny.

It's a good design, of course. And my son is a great, great player -- I would love to see him compete against someone really good, as that would be a lot more competitive for him. As it is, though, it's hard for me to want to get this back to the table. I would prefer other wargames that are one-offs, not campaigns, that are more streamlined and less fiddly. There is also Skirmish mode. Maybe that would be more fun. 

Overall, I find myself much more interested in setting up a game with him of Battle Lore or Battle of the Five Armies, or Combat Commander. Or, also great, playing co-op with this talented young man who's always fun to join in with, rather than be beaten by! So for me, a 6 out of 10 based on what I've seen of this game. I had high(er) hopes.

Little things here and there in this game bothers me. I find that quirky LOS rules in dungeon-crawlers should be a thing of the past. I hate the "trace an imaginary line" thingies in games. They always result in arguments and uncertainty around the table, even with veteran players.

Claustrophobia doesn't have that problem, Alien Vs Predator: the hunt begins doesn't have that problem, Gears of War doesn't have it... They are all much better games than Imperial Assault in my mind probably because of it.

As such, I prefer other games for campaign play and dungeon-crawling. As a skirmish game... I have much better already.

SW: IA is, without a question, a fantastic game. Let me preface this review by saying I have only played 1v1 (and 1v1v1) and have not had time to embark on the campaign portion of the game. That being said, the game is wonderfully put together and combat, skills, abilities, and strategy all work cohesively to create a well-thought out and put together game. The game play is great, but some of the rule book is a little hard to understand and the game takes a ton of time and a committed group to do the campaign.

RATING: 7
I want to like this more than I do.  The presentation is nice, but the campaign in the base set is just a bit dull and does not have that Star Wars feel to it. The scenarios all seemed one sided, and as the characters power up they seem  over powered and invincible compared to the Imperials. My understanding is that the later boxed campaigns are better, and that the skirmish game is better than the campaign. I'm not willing to keep giving FFG my money to find out, though. 

Hoping FFG will announce an app for this...Descent and Mansions of Madness were greatly improved by apps, so fingers crossed! Think of the sound effects! I'm only keeping my set knowing that the app is coming.

Update: an app is here! Early reviews say itâs great...hoping to play soon!

Heroes are more balanced than Descent. Balance between one versus many sides can still be quest dependent but the choices of skills are even more important since the dice rolling results and characters have been brought more in line with each other.

Some general improvements like alternating turns and the dodge die are great.

Random mission draw, different quality mission rewards, ally threat cost, and hidden mission events can hurt competitiveness but increase the adventure aspect of the game.

great game if you're not the owner :/ I'm always stuck playing the imperials for the campaign, and I never get to have "my character" throughout a campaign. I also don't get all the cool surprise story stuff as the imperials. skirmish is pretty good, but I rarely get to play 2 players.

My advice; convince a friend to get it

I love this game and the variety of heroes and imperial troops with the expansions, it is expensive and worth shopping around to save 15-30% on the RRP, but as a miniature painter this is well worth the cost.

3rd party AI system turns this into a great coop experience, but I would love to see an official app facilitate this mode of play and I think 6-8 mission long campaigns would be good to add as the core set is a long haul to get friends together consistently.

Wonderful tactical game set in the Star Wars universe. And it DOES feel like the Star Wars universe. Aspects such as Imperial might, Rebellion desperation, and the power and influence of the Force, all mesh together well in the narrative. Good-looking miniatures, variable settings for combat, fun dice, and a plethora of ability cards and strategy options. Good stuff.

Like many, I got swooped up in the hype for this game and so far, it's underwhelmed me a little. The skirmish mode is OK, but there's quite a bit of setup time and I think I'd rather play something like Memoir 44. The campaign annoys me that your "heroes" are these secondary characters instead of the main ones, like Han, Luke and Leia. I also much prefer playing the Imperial side, as multiple players on the Rebels side bogs down with tons of downtime between turns, arguing and players trying to take control and telling what to do. I'll continue to feel it out with some more plays before giving a final review.

Gioco eccellente, per materiali, ambientazione e coinvolgimento. La modalitÃ  campagna Ã¨ appagante e avvincente, lo skirmish Ã¨ ugualmente divertente. L'impianto regolistico lo mette a metÃ  strada tra uno gioco di "imperial crawling" e uno di combattimenti tattici tra miniature, in una fusione che mi piace molto. Sebbene abbia la stessa ossatura di Descent II edizione, se ne discosta per parecchi aspetti, snellendo e migliorando molte sue regole e caratteristiche, risultando decisamente superiore sotto tutti i punti di vista, a meno che non siate innamorati del fantasy. Ma volete mettere entrare in scena a sorpresa con Darth Vader e seminare il panico tra i poveri Ribelli??

Star Wars: Imperial Assault is my first foray into the Descent system and our first "date" was enjoyed by me. I was a little surprised that the game is quite light rulewise (with the exception of some timing questions). It's more like a beer and pretzels game than a serious brain burner. Chuck some dice and have fun. That's about it. The only thing one could hold against it was brought up by someone from my gaming group: "It's surprisingly unthematic for a Star Wars game". Although all the characters are there and you're fighting with the merchandise you'd expect in the Star Wars universe, we figured that it wasn't about epic battles but more like a race to achieve your objectives as fast as possible. Because of the harsh round limit in the first scenario, we didn't even bother to kill all the bad guys but raced for the terminals. In the end, we were swarmed by Storm Troopers but this didn't matter when we beat the last terminal to pieces.

I really enjoy this game, but as much as I like the idea behind having a game master, I think I will enjoy the game much more once they release the app (like they did for Descent).  When playing with a GM, it always feels like they could totally route the players if they really wanted to do so, which often leads to holding back a bit, which actually makes it almost too easy for the players.  It can be hard to find a good balance where it's a truly tense game, though that may speak more to my tactical ineptitude than the game itself.  The missions are fun, the figures are great, and the campaign is well done.  I really look forward to playing it more after the app comes out.

The game is very thematic and I would have loved it if I played it when I was a teenager.  But my gaming tastes have changed a lot since then.  Also I don't have the time to play through all those campaigns with the same players.  It's not a bad dice chucker, and I appreciate a good dice chucker.  But this game has little replayability once it has been played through once.  I've never played Descent but have played Mutant Chronicles and Earth Reborn.  It reminds me a lot of both.  One thing is for sure, it is really tough on the Rebel players.  We lost both of our missions...and that's with the Empire player taking it easy on us...by not drawing some kind of card.  Basically this is just a move and attack w/dice game.  Would of been my favorite game when I was 16.

RATING: 10
Terrific game. I've played through the Core Campaign, Twin Shadows and halfway through Hoth currently.
The Campaigns tend to vary in difficulty for the Rebels. Core isn't a cakewalk, but it is definitely the easiest campaign made yet. One issue with the campaign structure tends to be a rich-get-richer mechanic. If the Imperial wins he gets more xp, which puts him in a better position to win the next, etc. Snowballing in campaigns really is a risk I've found.
Skirmish, in my honest opinion, is the most balanced way to play this game and I'm very fond of the strategic side of it. Campaigns are fun stories, skirmish is all tactics.
Balancing can be a problem in some missions, and AP is certainly an issue with some groups, but neither sway me from loving this game.

Excellent reskinning of Descent 2nd edition with changes.  Solid theme, and playing the Imperial (Overlord) player doesn't bother me as much as it does in Descent (I wish Descent 2nd had more fully co-op scenarios).  Skirmish is okay, but currently is dominated by Imperial side because of Imperial Officers (personal feelings based on what I've seen being played).

Decent game and we had fun with it,  probably more the group than the game causing the fun to ensue.  Wow this is # 11 on BGG, must be due to the allure of the theme and the chrome?  Overly complex for what it is, decisions are not all that meaningful or tough.....nothing new here and quite frankly theme falls a little flat for me.

Much like Descent 2nd Edition, but with many improvements in my opinion.  The side-missions, character progression, combat and turn-order have all seen very positive changes that I think make this the definitive "dungeon-crawler" of the 2010's.  Very cool campaign mode, but also a skirmish mode for those that just want to shoot each other head-to-head.  Highly recommended.

8 on the Cindometer (Star Wars is her one exception from her usual aversion to sci-fi )

It is Descent v2.5 I'll call it. The Skirmish Mode I think is a toss away and a way to try to make it qualify as a miniatures game. I do love me some Descent and the small tweaks I think are for the better here. As the usual Overlord though I am disappointed that there are some hidden triggers and surprises in the game because most likely I won't be the one to experience the surprise but rather spring it. And funny enough, I don't see this game as a replacement for Descent at this point. First I'm a tactical miniatures junkie, my genre of choice. Second though it does feel different enough to work along side and provide a slightly different experience.

Star wars in a box. FFG hit the nail on the head with the theme. Theres some balance issues in campaign mode if one side gets a string of succesful missions which players will need to sort out themselves with adjustments where relevant. But the missions are so much fun. The minis on the board look excellent and really have a lot of individuality due to the various skills,items and abilities that define them. Theres a true sense of star wars adventure in nearly every mission. Environments are really well designed, making you feel that theres always a clever plan of attack hidden in front of you. 
    Skirmish mode is also excellent. Being able to customise your squad for skirmishes makes for an excitingly competitive meta game which i haven't given nearly enough time to. 
    App supported solo/cooperative mode has breathed even more life into this, which makes me want to go out and buy the various expansions on offer.

RATING: 7.25
Imperial Assault is basically Descent 2.5 ed, but that's a good platform to work from, so why not?  There's the usual spate of changes, most of which are improvements.
Your heroes come in the usual archetypes (blaster-wielding smuggler, jedi-esque woman with staff, veteran trooper, grizzled commander, etc.), and are locked into their classes.  (Unlike in 2nd, where you can select your sub-class from a menu of choices.)  This gives you starting equipment and a series of purchasable abilities, just like 2nd.  You move and act exactly as before.  The only change is the dice, where they've reconfigured how attack and defense works.  It's a minor thing, but you no longer have that 1/6th miss chance on your own attack dice.  Instead, it's a 1/6th chance to dodge on the white dice (only used when attacking agile enemies; most use the black die).  This is less frustrating.
Also patched is the way that heroes heal and are KO'ed.  It's always been that if you were short stamina (now 'strain') for some effect, it down-converted to health loss.   But the other way was never true until now.  Now, if you've got 3 strain on your sheet and you have a capacity of 4, you can rest and get all 3 off, plus heal one HP.  If you do run out of HP, you flip over to your wounded side (which has one fewer base ability & some slightly lowered stats) and go back to full health.  The OL has to kill you [i]again[/i] to knock you out of the game.  We've yet to see this happen, since healing is so much easier.  (Rest twice on your turn and that'll put you back near full if you had no strain used).  This means there's a little less of an incentive to just try and murder the weakest character (unless the mission requires you to).
Threat is back, and spawning enemies is back too.  It's not near as annoying as 1st ed, though, since reinforcements can only be brought in through specific spawn points.
The scenario design is about the same as 2nd ed, for all the good and bad that implies.  There are some small improvements, though, with decisions that the OL player gets to make when he has a chance to throw a wrench in things.  The campaign is also reworked, with more branching paths and better incorporation of side mission choices.  
I've had fun with it so far, and we've been holding on, despite the number of times where it seems like the scenario is hopelessly stacked against us.

This is the Descent done right. I could write an extensive list of things I love in this game (in comparison to Descent) but to make things short, this is perfect tactical campaign game in a universe I can relate to, full of characters we all love. Scenarios are fun and challenging so far, rules are concise, balanced and well covered.
The fact it comes with rules for 1 on 1 skirmish game, 3 books of rules and awesome, beautiful miniatures (yes, AT-ST, I am looking at yous) makes it pretty much my favourite game of 2014 (and could enter in top 10 of all time).

[b]Edit:[/b] No, it will not be in the top 10 of all time, it was just a hype. But still a great game.

Meh.  I think there's some balancing issues between player/keeper, but ultimately, there's nothing really new here.  For the 1 vs. all mechanic, I prefer Mansions of Madness.  The only draw here is the Star Wars license, but beyond that, I just don't feel there's enough here to warrant the ticket price.

That being said, if you are a minis kinda guy or gal, these are awesome sculpts and you can totally put them on your bed and go "p-chu, p-chu!" when nobody's looking.

I've only played as the Imperial Player (i.e. the dungeon master). I've done one campaign to completion and started another one that won't get finished just because of scheduling. It's a fun game, but has some balance issues. It seems easy to snowball and one of the Imperial Player classes (Subversive Tactics) makes things hard on the Rebel Players in an un-fun way. The campaign is won or lost strictly on the basis of the last game, which is an awkward way to end. That said, it's still a cool campaign experience even with those problems.

RATING: 3
Rating is based on campaign mode only. I had to go with a 3 as it best describes how I feel... that is, not likely to play it again, but maybe in a year or so I could be convinced to play a shorter campaign, with only 1 or 2 Rebel players.

The 1-vs-n format of the game creates serious problems for competitive play and it was common to go for 2-3 hours with my character only have 6-8 meaningful actions. I would contribute to other Rebel turns, but to avoid being that "alpha" player I didn't try to force my opinion on others.  Further, if other Rebels made decisions I didn't agree with and I couldn't convince them otherwise I would feel frustration towards them... not good (I haven't felt this way in other co-op games... probably because you're playing against the game, not an opponent). I just can't reconcile a game where 1 of 5 players takes up over half of the game play time and has the opportunity to make 5x more meaningful decisions than other players. Additionally, the missions take too long in general, the round limit forces the Imperial player to use tactics that are not fun to play against (i.e. blocking, stunning, delaying, beating us down while the Rebels are effectively running away, etc.) and the hidden information is annoying (an AT-ST appears out of nowhere, Imperial characters next to a crate recover damage, etc.). There's not much story to the campaign either... a few sentences before each mission and a few sentences at the end, in fact, I'm not sure what the story was and I was never able to feel any attachment to my character, which may have been because our plays were spread out.

I also feel this is a difficult game to play competitively as the Imperial... again, the tactics you need to use are frustrating and you'll take heat from the Rebels. Also, since the Imperial does consume so much of the game play, you're likely to feel rushed as you don't want everyone else waiting on you throughout the game. Further, the Imperial player has to invest even more time than the Rebels to prepare the missions and such.

I'm glad we tried this but I just can't see investing another 30-40 hours on this game at this point... I would much rather get repeated plays of deeper strategy games like Tzolkin or Caverna.

It's a shame because I really wanted to like this game... the components are great, the IP is great and combat solid, just not for me. The 2 player skirmish mode may be a better fit and would likely have a much higher rating.

Love this game. I have played it very little, but the theme is probably my favorite one out there, and the game features it pretty well. The components look stunning and the missions are pure fun. Only downfall: you need to gather the same 4-5 people group to follow the campaign and, unfortunately it hardly happens. Have not tried skirmish yet.

UPDATE:

After some more plays, three of them on skirish mode, this game is awesome. I think I even like the Skirmish Mode better than the campaign, because it features a quick scenario to play with tactical decisions and without dismantling the map you created, you can play a second different mission there. Love it.

(1)The greatest thing put within a cardboard box since Heroscape-Rise of the Valkyrie! Finally THE greatest license has a set of rules that are worthy of it!

The game is not as accessible to new players as Heroscape... this is a big deal in my book.  That being said, it is very streamlined for a "gamer's game." Dice are great... LOS rule is great... Board is great... skirmish AND campaign are great... Serious home run... just not the game to bust out with an 8 year old.

These are not the droids you're looking for.

I really believe that many of the high ratings here are due to the convergence of Star Wars fandom and Descent. Which is exactly why I spent months like a kid before Christmas waiting for this game to come out.

Boy have I been dissapointed.

This is not simply Descent in the Star Wars universe as many other commenters have said. Although the basic mechanic is the same, the "minor" differences create a dramatically different game play experience.

Alternating turns means that not only do turns grind on, there is much less collaboration between the rebels. Unlike Descent where my group carefully plots each turn together, in Imperial Assault, we take our turns individually for the most part and then play Tetris on our phones while waiting for our turn to come around again.

The "narrative" function of each encounter means that the Imperial player must plan carefully and well in advance in order to have a coherent strategy throughout the encounter.

The game drags on and on, really. My group has been playing Descent almost weekly for two years and it's rare that an encounter takes more than 3 or 4 hours. But 4 hours seems to be the minimum time to get through an Imperial Assault encounter, which means it's not really appropriate for our regular after work Tuesday game night.

Finally, my biggest gripe with the game is that it really does not do justice to the flavor of Star Wars universe. Chewbacca never hid from storm troopers until he could find a med pack. And yet the best way for the rebels to win in this game is to proceed cautiously and methodically. The objective for the Imperial player is usually to inflict enough wounds that the heroes are considered "wounded". This causes the heroes to spend a lot of effort to avoid becoming wounded rather than heroically pursuing their goals.

So, my group which is Star Wars and Descent obsessed, has abandoned our campaign after about 7 encounters. You cant say we didn't give it the college try. But in the end, we were tired of not enjoying our weekly game night.

I think this game is perfect.  However, I've only played it twice so I'm not sure.
After a few plays, I give the skirmish game an 8, but the campaign only a 6.  They all seem to be push fast objectives with only a certain amount of turns.  I don't care for that so much.

I have a complicated, love/hate relationship with the Descent and SW:IA model. Itâs only been recently that I think Iâve come to understand that this game system is not what I ultimately want it to be, whether I play it 1vMany or coop. Iâm expecting a more strategic experience when the dice overpower any efforts at good play. Whatâs more, I come for a dungeon crawl only to learn itâs a dungeon race.

My group and I played a yearlong Descent v1 campaign using Road to Legend. I went from loving the game to loathing it. The big problem with Descent v1 was how the Overlord would activate all his guys at once and pick off one guy (often strolling by others; [i]ta ta![/i]) until he was knocked out. Then repeat. This was THE way for the OL to play every scenario as it worked. And the downtime waiting for him to maximize his 10+ dudes and cards was annoying. It felt imbalanced in terms of both power and fun. Throw in lots of rules ambiguities and the fun got sucked out, and we simply ended things prematurely because nobody was having fun.

Then SW:IA comes along and, as wary as I am, I'm convinced to try it -- and lo and behold, I find it fixes just about everything I hated about Descent. The one-at-a-time monster group activation vs all-at-once is brilliant so turns go much more quickly and things feel much more balanced (no more monster parade of suffering 12 attacks before your next turn). We meet monthly for a 1vMany campaign. Iâm in love again! 

But something is bothering me about these games. I leave my sessions fried after 4+ hours of parsing out permutations of movements and actions to find the best one because the result always comes down to the dice anyway. I donât feel that the player agency is commensurate with the effort required. You can figure out the best order of moves all you want, but the dice will determine the story told. 

I originally rated the game a 10, but after playing the campaign once through, Iâve found the balance is nowhere near what Iâd like it be. Weâre all strong players but have found unless the Imperial Player doesnât play well, the odds are stacked grossly in his favor due to how much regeneration and surprise he has on his side. Thatâs because the game effectively cheats in order to balance things. You get done wiping out some enemy figures in your way but â surprise â a new group spawns right where they were or even behind you. 

Frequently, hours of careful tactical moves on our part are undone by spawns and events that we could not have foreseen. Again, I get the concept behind that, but it often renders hours of careful planning moot because â surprise spawn! I long for the control in Descent whereby players could control where monsters spawned. 

In one session, we rolled dodges on the first 7 of 8 rolls and got off to a fast start but that still wasnât enough to stop the spawn-athon that happened near our end goal. We just couldnât fight through it all and made the scenario feel unwinnable. I just wish there was either an AI that adjusted as the game went on (for example, only so many figures allowed on the board at a time) or the players have one "No Spawn" card they can play once a game when it spins out of control against them. Unfortunately the game is frequently punishing and over before itâs over.

I also question the choice to have the game become quality vs quality AND quantity. Shouldn't the rebels be markedly stronger than the enemies? [see Conan for how that's done well] Instead it's a game of equals vs equals plus numbers. Our Imperial Player astutely bought the power whereby when we rested, he could make an interrupt attack or movement which really hampered our ability to recover. Just brutal. That needs to be nerfed. 

In the end, I've come to realize that I'm not very good at this game because I approach it as a dungeon crawl when it's more of a run-n-gun to reach the next objective point. Which is fine, but it's not what I want when I sit down to play this type of game.

Cleaner crisper version of descent with a star wars theme. 

The campaign is a bit all over the place and there is not really that cohesive a story however game play is good and engaging with a variety of win conditions for the rebels (Imperials seem to win if the rebels are all wounded or run out of time)

Seems a bit powerful that it is impossible to miss with a melee attack, but maybe that was one of the things updated between Descent first edition that I also own at this iteration of the same game.

I like the XP and cash to allow you to upgrade your character and the imperial units however it like it could have used a little more play testing and a bit more finesse.

Artwork and minis are good and the scenario maps are varied. The map pieces fit well together which was one of my major complaints with descent 1st ed. 

I look forward to more games of this and I have to agree with my partner that this has a more two player feel to it, which one player controlling the imperial units and another the rebel units. with multiple rebel players the game drags a little and you can end up with some seriously dull turns for example I move one square, I open the door. movement and action done! playing multiple characters negates turns like this as you have other characters who will be in better positions and thus able to do stuff on their turn.

It's Descent 2.5, with streamlined rules and an added skirmish mode!  I think that it improves what is already one of my favourite games with enough care and attention to make it the definitive dungeon crawler.  My only complaints come from the Star Wars licence, which I'm a bit indifferent towards and the fact that the blister packs are outrageously expensive for what you get.  Also, I liked that once you chose a character in Descent, you could then decide which class you wanted to be, with more being added in later expansions.  In Imperial Assault this just isn't an option.

My numero uno in the collection. The theme just oozes Star Wars, heroes are recognizable and would be fitting in the cinematic universe. They have fun abilities adding to the tactical nature of the game. Miniatures are superbly sculpted and are begging to be painted (which I admit I still haven't done yet). If I have to give one negative point to the game, then I would be the fact that it's hard to find a group of players available to finish the game's campaign.

Imperial Assault is a very thematic game and the rules have been improved when comparing to Descent: Journeys in the Dark 2nd Edition. The game is asymmetric so, yes, some missions will feel imbalanced - too easy for the Empire or too easy for the Rebels - but overall both sides have a fair chance of winning the campaign. A full campaign lasts about 10 sessions and over 30 hours of gameplay. Excellent replay value and there is also a skirmish mode for fast and fun battles.

Realistically, you're going to end up spending quite a bit of money on this game if you want to own it. The base game is fantastic, but you'll want more of the add-on figures, and then maybe some expansions too.
 That being said, if you can justify the price, it is quite simply phenomenal. There is simply so much to do right out of the box, you likely won't see a lot of the missions. The missions are weighted fantastically well, and playing as either the rebel or the imperials are an absolute blast.

Very strategic and tense tactical combat, a genuine Star Wars feel, diverse characters with interesting leveling options, and a ton of great components. Although somewhat disconnected, the branching campaign sets the replayability through the roof, as it adds to the map modularity and the multiple play modes. The game is optimized for campaign play, so it almost requires playing with a consistent group. I would have appreciated an easy way to jump into scenarios with rotating players: it is still possible to manage (as we have attempted to), but keeping track of the level, resources, and chosen paths lengthens the already busy inter-mission bookkeeping. Perhaps other similar games (like TMNT or Conan) would better serve such a play approach.

The biggest downside for me is that the imperial player alternates between rooting for herself (you want to deploy your best tactics) and rooting for the hero team (you want everyone to have a good time). No victory (imperial or rebel) feels complete when you are alone. :( Therefore, I really look forward for the release of the delayed app to transform this into a fully-cooperative adventure, and hope that the tactical depth does not suffer in the process. Such an app would greatly improve the already awesome experience that is this huge game.

Improved version of Descent/Doom system. Fixes some of the major issues like going after the weakest hero, removes the overlord deck (or at least simplifies it). The scenarios so far seem to be more interesting and tense, the campaign has a good flow to it and I can see a lot of variability and high degree of replayability. Still the same game though, same crazy amount of stuff to track and unclear interactions. Guess you can't have one without the other.

The tactical game is fun too, however, I don't like the booster situation as I don't want to invest hundreds in keeping up, so I'll stick to the 4v1 player campaign which is quite enjoyable.  Some missions are very very hard, but the balance between the Rebels and Empire player seems decent (GM doesn't have to play with kid gloves).

Well, what an excellent fighting game from one of my favourite franchises! So glad to have held off from buying Descent to finally picking a game that uses the same system (with definite differences) and a beautiful Star Wars theme. Glorious components and everything generally looks great. Skirmish rules are simple but leaves a lot of room for fun. I've only played the skirmish mode but I'm very much looking forward to playing taking on the campaign mode!  But even if the game was just Skirmishes, there would be enough in here for me.  An absolute favourite.

Fun but long. Best in campaign mode but perhaps limit to one mission each session. I prefer being a Rebel and fighting the Imperials as part of the group but being an Imperial player can be fun too. With three players it seems stacked against the rebels but not as much with four or five players. I haven't played the two player Skirmish game yet. This game is a re-implementation of Descent but I think it is designed so that the "overlord" player has more fun. Expansions huge cash grab.

Take away the jank rules and mismatched theme from [thing=104162][/thing] and you get a mighty fine system. There's no more pretense of dungeon crawling or loot (well, chests, but their items are temporary), just an objective based squad game with some satisfying surprises to stage for the overlord/imperial and interesting XP-based upgrades for both sides. I think that some of the scenarios could telegraph a little less information to the Rebels for more suspense & immersion, but overall the campaign is very well paced.

I need to get this back to the table with a larger group. Playing with 2 players it just became a chore in some missions. The map design often forces a style of blocking and rushing game play which I just don't find very fun. There is also a pretty big issue in the campaign where the winner keeps getting benefits which helps them win. I've tried playing the DM style role, but I don't see why I'd play a game like this and not just a traditional RPG if that was the sort of experience I was looking for.

With the right group I could easily see this as a higher rating, but for now I can't see it coming back to the table with any regularity. Hopefully the app will bring it back.

RATING: 10
The most epic campaign style game to date.

The SW theme really allows you to immerse yourself and the scripted events in each mission add even more flavor.

This game is very tactical in nature, more so than descent. This can be a bit brutal for the rebels, who are usually out gunned and aren't aware of the possible events in each mission.

If you need to win every mission, this game is not balanced for that as certain missions are harder for one side or another and dice rolls play a big factor. If you take it as a story game all leading up to the finale, you will really enjoy the experience.

For a more balanced tactical game, the skirmish mode is excellent and FFG is doing a good job of promoting it in stores. It plays fast and is very tactical with lots of options

Having completed one campaign I can safely state that the game retains the fun through protracted play (took us a year thanks to schedules...)  A Medium/Light turn-based dudes on a board Star Wars drenched experience.  A definite for Star Wars and squad combat lovers (doubly so thanks to the included skirmish mode) looking for 1-2 hours bites, a maybe for everyone else.  Many rules have been streamlined for ease of play so really hardcore players may find it too easy.  The base box contains everything you need for many weekends though all the expansion packs add to the visual aspect and extend the lifespan with new missions to squeeze in.

Does a decent job providing some RPG elements that make me feel invested in my character.  

So far in the campaign I am playing it feels a bit too easy for the heroes but I think it would be a different story if the DM imposed a time limit on our talking strategy and he's pretty lenient when we are like "oh I meant to go here."  

It also potentially suffers the alpha gamer problem (depending on the group).

With some of the recent games that have come with this style, either all v 1 or all v the box, you would have to be a star wars fan to pick this above the rest.  Fortunately, it really feels like star wars - even to the point of the AT-ST feeling a little silly, unwieldy and large for what it actually accomplishes, just like in the movies!

Seriously, the AT-ST has to cupid shuffle it's way around the map.

Oh and the characters offer a nice amount of diversity and synergy.  I would never to choose to play with anything less than a full complement of characters.

I love my plastic starships in XW and Armada but for me, Imperial Assault is the real deal if you want a game with an RPG feel but not the full RPG experience. Also, the campaigns are absolutely superb. I don't play skirmish mode.

The App is OK but the main reason I use it is to try playing as Rebels (I'm normally Imperials) in solo mode.

I have never played Descent or Doom. We finished the campaign of 12 missions - and it ended in such epicness. I was the imperials and even if the rebels won the finale, most missions were so tense. Our group is full of experienced board gamers, so it has been a tough tactical battle for both sides.

Characters are distinct, the development is satisfying, the mechanic works smoothly, except a few minor things. The missions are never dull.

Just think; after 15 meetings in 6 months, our group are eager to play Twin Shadows. Solid 10/10.

Wow!.  Awesome game.   The highest rating for a game I've awarded(ever) and definitely good value.   A bit tricky to learn and time consuming to set up.  Having said that once you have the hang of it and your mission is under way, the game delivers the feeling of being in your own Star Wars movie. Whether you're the empire trying to foil the rebel plans or the rebels fighting against seemingly impossible odds, Imperial Assault keeps you coming back for more.  
PS. SW:IA is actually two quite different but both equally excellent games in one box depending on whether you play Campaign or Skirmish games.

RATING: 7
Most of the game is actually story, theme, miniatures, artwork etc., not so much actual game play, but the game play is still very exciting. Most interesting things of it are defense dice, different attack dice and special character powers and the movie story itself. All together those things (components, art, theme, story, custom dice rolling etc.) make quite unique thematic Star Wars experience. Looking forward deeper into game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This one is fun all around with a good branching story that is rather compelling and includes Luke, Vader, and others in a believable way. The power creep in the campaign is hard to contain. The heroes have to be nerfed.

In the end, this is best played in skirmish mode or with a custom made campaign. Game is not special, but when I play I can hear the Williams score playing in my head. This is the game I wanted back in the golden age of science fiction: when I was 13 years old.

My 2nd all time favorite game. Great story elements, great mechanics, spectacular miniatures, epic missions that many times comes to the last die roll, great theme that matches the gameplay and some of the greatest dice i have ever come across.

You gonna need to play some missions with the same players for everyone to get used to and grab all the little details.

2 cons for me are the set up time and sometimes the snowball effect.

As a generic sci-fi skirmish game i would give it a solid 7, but FFG is using it as a way to suck the dollars of the Star Wars zealots who tosh money at whatever has the SW logo printed on it. If you don't believe me, consider this: with the base box they only sell you half the game, you have to spend 80 aditional bucks for minis that are should be there, but there's only a cheap carboard token. It's the DLC of boargames, and that is unnacceptable.

Also, I can't believe over 1200 people gave this a 10 just because it's Star Wars, as much as I love the original films.

I would love to rate it a 9,  but I can't it just doesn't feels thematic enough.  That Imperium seems to have infinite resources but actually the Imperial player just brings one stormtrooper Per round in, but heroes will kill up to three per round. Tanks like Gaarkhan can ignore good positioning, he just rushes through it all  and is almost impossible to kill (rushing strategy works in most of my played missions, so where are tactical decisions?). In Descent the overlord has some action cards to spice up the course of the campaign, in imperial assault those cards are moved in the skirmish game.  So playing as the heroes is fun, playing as the imperial player feels very limited. Rarely buying one command card is not enough. You wanna field an elite unit, forget it, much too expensive. You can't wait 4 turns to save up points for it or rebels will have finished their goals already. Agenda cards are mostly useless too (f.i. Add Sidemission xyz to the campaign -> why should I care about this?). A lot of wasted potential.  Furthermore it is almost impossible to bring those expansionpack Minis like Vader or Solo into campaign play. It seems that this game Is much more developed for skirmish mode instead of campaign, which is just clunky.

Edit: The more missions I play, the more I have to downrate this game. Nearly broken Mission "12 o'clock p.m." Page 8. Setup time 20min, play time 5min. Guys, this mission is rubbish. Granted it could work with 4 heroes, but with 3 = one with double activation token it just did not.  The player who controls Jyn gets the second activation token and rushes to the comlink.  With a successful test the door opens and she can shoot a first time on Szark. With 2nd Action a 2nd Shot. Then immediately again 2 Attacks (2nd act. token) and Szark is dead before the Imperial player could do one action. Game over. Now judge yourself if this is broken or not.
 I will continue to downrate this game with every mission that is a disgrace in balancing.

This game needs an App so bad!

RATING: 7
Being an adult gamer with a wife but no life-or-death responsibilities to rear children is a fraught thing. It reminds one that to many, living a biologically unreproductive life, a life devoted to life itself, learning, art, fun, and other indulgences--is ultimately, to a certain, distinctly puritan frame of thinking, selfish. When we are finally too old to fully enjoy those things, we will only have each other, or the crumbling infrastructure of the state, to care for our needs. It is potentially frightening enough that one chooses not to consider it at all, but to defer that anxiety elsewhere.

Playing Descent, in either edition, was a hatefully stupid thing. It required you to think long and hard about decisions which were ultimately out of your control anyway. It allowed for zero creative engagement with the game, instead plugging any question you might have about the way your characters interacted with the world with a card with plus-one something printed on it. But I liked the figurines, and in quiet hours I learned to paint them pretty well. Nonetheless, I have never met a human being who found the experience of playing Descent more fun or interesting than a thousand similar alternatives. And I kept trying to make the game good, with house rules and various incentives. This never worked, but it did became a small obsession, indicative of a greater anxiety about things not in the game, anxieties about one's place in the world, about the idea that when one is dead, one may go childless and unremembered in the larger weave of the world.

Imperial Assault is a mildly improved version of the Descent system. It is just as satisfying to paint. My friends will play it (as long as I keep certain needlessly complex elements of the game structure hidden), because, for them, as for myself, Star Wars is an unadulterated source of nostalgia. I own everything for the system, and sometimes dote on the game in a way that puzzles and vexes me, because it does not reward extended thought. And one day, hopefully a long time from now, my lifeless body will be reduced to carbon in an unfurnished room with an antiseptic odor to it, and I will no longer have any anxieties or obsessions to worry about.

The only reason It gets this high rating is because of Skirmish. The replay value and the customization options are the most interesting parts about this game for me. 
Campaign mode is also fun, but bot as deep as you would like. 

I like all games, but one of my favorites is Magic, and i can relate to this kind of games that gives you the chance to customize and build your own "deck" "army"  or what ever to battle against other players. Now, add the Star wars theme to it, and it becomes even more interesting for me.

The biggest concern for me is if It stays long enough active to invest the time and money on it. So far they have done an excellent job at having a healthy environment in the Skirmish mode and keeping fairly everything playable and somewhat balanced. So, the longer this game stays around, the better it gets if they keep printing content that fixes those early mistakes...things like cost curve, OP stats or abilities, and other interactions that could smooth the game. Also, once the game feels in a good spot, They could start bringing new elements to the game that could potentially deepen the game play.
Basically is a great game for what i was published for (campaign being little behind) and with great potential to become even bigger...Not as Magic, but as x-wing.

Finally, as a positive point for those who like the campaign mode more, FFG has announced that they are working on an app that could definitely could change deeply the dynamic of the game, even said to have a solo option...We will see how good or bad this app can be.

Enjoyed the games for as long as i had it, but at the end i wasn't play it much since i moved away from my playing group.so traded it. i also updated my rating.

Imperial Assault is the best miniatures game I have ever played. It is incredibly thematic and entertaining. The developers at FFG have done an amazing job of making you feel like you are actually taking part in a Star Wars story line and all of the missions play out like a part from the movie or an episode of Rebels.

The quality of all the components is very high, especially compared to other games. The minis are a blast to paint and really come to life on the board. The combat is very well thought out and engaging with their own unique die that pertain to each individual character's abilities. For instance, red die are very high damage, green die have good damage with range utility, blue are high range but low utility, white defense die are for agile characters while black are for armored etc.. it just all fits very, very well.

The price point is high but you also get 2 games in one with the skirmish. Skirmish is great even if you just want to play head to head with friends, or you can take it a step forward and join the great online community. But even if you never plan to play skirmish, the campaign itself is very lengthy with a lot of options. 11 missions will take your roughly 20-25 hours to complete, then you can play again and see very few of the same missions depending on if you win or lose. Then as you add blister packs you get more missions which expands the choices even further.

I could go on forever about this game, the bottom line is that balance wise it is great, quality wise it is great and entertainment wise you are getting all you pay for and more.

As A Star Wars fan, I was looking for a dungeon crawler/dice game so this was an obvious one. a friend of mine has Descent 2nd and I like it so this seems like a good match.

Campaign mode seems a bit automatic but still has progression. Some mission a for sure balance for one faction of the other. The success of these mission are only worth their reward in progression. Each side wants to win to get stronger so you get ready for the final mission. It's done well but the campaign does simulate one thing right based on the movies. The Rebels are outgun and it's in their best interest to get on the objective as quickly as possible. This is not a campaign where you can just try to kill everyone to win. If you try this, you will lose. There is always a timing going on so the Rebels are best to achieve their goals as quickly as possible and leave. Hit and run tactics is very similar to what the rebels have to do in the movies.

If it was only for the campaign, this game would still be great but the huge advantage this game has over its predecessor (descent) is the inclusion of a skirmish mode. Now, if you can't get your group going to continue to campaign, you can play a 2 player game and people get to "build" their army to their licking and power. This brings this game over its predecessor and open it up to more than just a dungeon crawler.

RATING: 9
It uses the well known Descent mechanism, cleans it up a bit, adds a Star Wars theme, and voila! legal heroine.

It doesn't get higher marks because in the campaign we played, (2 rebel players against the Imperial), we got creamed, and we often felt powerless to act against an ever growing powerful imperial player.

Still, top marks for what you get in the box, tons tons of minis and bits, an "Amerithrash" player's dream.

Yera

lo tiene casi todo pintado, por cierto. :D (esta QTCGS)

Descent engine aplicado a La Guerra de las Galaxias. No hace falta decir nada mas. 

Todo lo bueno y todo lo malo de Descent (con algunas correcciones sobre la materia) aplicado a la trama argumental mas reconocible de los ultimos casi 50 aÃ±os. 

Para mi gusto el defecto mas reseÃ±able (ya sabeis que se me da mejor seÃ±alar los defectos que las virtudes xD) es que, dentro de la tematica, el argumento y elementos incluidos son muy de universo expandido. del universo expandido nuevo hecho acordemente con disney, se entiende, ya que el antiguo UE ha sido declarado obsoleto. 

Me refiero por ejemplo a que los personajes jugadores son todos inventados y practicamente irreconocibles en las peliculas u otros materiales expandidos (quiza sean personajes de los actuales juego de rol o del LCG, pero como no tengo el placer con ninguno de los dos...). ocurre lo mismo con el desarrollo de misiones, los enemigos... y eso en mi opinion le resta un punto en inmersividad. 

Los personajes conocidos (luke, han solo, chuwi, leia, darth vader, boba fett, etc) entran al juego como "lugartenientes" que pueden participar con o contra los jugadores siguiendo determinadas reglas del escenario. Esto lo hace muy inmersivo, pero mucho menos que manejar a los propios protagonistas. Una "operacion desperre" que se veia venir de lejos, en toda su maxima expresion. 

Jugablemente y en calidades todo aquello que se puede decir de descent es aplicable a IA. 

pero en mi opinion de momento IA no es el amerigame definitivo. es un excelente juego, pero va a estar demasiado monetizado y se han mojado demasiado poco en los contenidos para que en mi valoracion llegue a ser absolutamente magnifico. 

pd. ni me molesto en llevar la cuenta de las expansiones que ha comprado yera de este juego. escribo "todas" y me juego las uÃ±as de los meÃ±iques de los pies a que acierto. xD

I still haven't tried the campaign, because honestly playing the Empire does not look terribly fun. I'm open to being proven wrong, though.
The skirmish was unexpectedly fun. As of a billion expansions in, there's a decent amount of variety--and though the activation system is the same old nonsense, there's still some room for cleverness.

Actually, if I could give it more than 10 I would, it's fantastic and only going to get more amazing! Just look at what's in Twin Shadows coming up...droooool :D

Descent 2.0 needed twearking, mainly on the Overlord side of things.

My main gaming bud tugs himself off to anything star wars. 
Not as much as the yanks do, but, still quite a bit of British, stiff upper lip tuggage. 

Those two facts that could not be ignored when this title came about.

So; even when i said i wasn't going to; I went and bought it. I am not even that bothered for Star Wars.
Held out for five months. Very good willpower, but broke in the end. Glad I did now.

Models are unbelievably good, so much so in fact, that after opening the box, I needed Han and Chewy and IG-88. 
My one complaint is for Darth, who has a (star wars 5 and 6) fat head, and is in no way proportional to that Brizol bell-end David Prowse!

Have played two missions and we desperately wanted to play a third but ran out of time. 
Basically, It's bloody great. 
The missions here are like in Descent. 
Race against time missions. But where in descent that was thematically shite, and everyone really wanted to dungeon crawl. 
In SWIA, it seems to fit better. After all, to quote my bud, 'its called assault!' True

I am playing the empire and I actually feel like I get to do something. 
Descent has def been superseded. But they have had over 10 yrs, 4 or more titles and millions of hours of, profit making play testing with this ruleset, to get it somewhere near right. So there is no excuse for this to be anything less than the dogs bollox.

Just need a few more sessions to see if the rebel scums upgrades outstrip the empires puny ones. Really hope not, that was the biggest thing that needed putting right from 2.0. {10 campaign plays in, and the imperials have turned the kick ass corner. Get In!}

and we haven't even thought about skirmish rules yet.... 

I am a weak person. 
My name is Han and I'm a boardgamer, 
it has been less than 5 minutes since my last fix.

RATING: 3
Fairly nicely done tactical squad game in the Star Wars universe; rules are surprisingly unchanged from Descent. Game encourages being aggressive as the attackers almost always have the advantage in most situations. Scenario design wasn't too exciting for the first couple we played, however. Well done overall and I can see why some people like it a lot, but not really something I need to own.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Rating is for skirmish head-to-head game only. Some good ideas in the game and the interaction of character abilities and the dice mechanics is brilliant. There's a lot of depth in the actual gameplay. In the end this game falls victim to only having certain builds that are competitive, 1 (or maybe none) big character and a bunch of low-point grunts. Not the kind of force I like playing so to Ebay my stuff goes. Epic Duels is still the king of ground based Star Wars combat games IMO.

Played at Salt Lake Gaming Con.  Just can't really see ever playing it again.  The gameplay is pretty much exactly like Descent 2.  And that's not bad, but it's not really all that good either.  SOooooo many decks of cards with no WORDS ON THE BACK FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW WHICH DECK IS WHICH.  Jesus.  That was driving me insane.  The Star Wars-yness was done nicely, as FFG always does with Star Wars.  The minis were nice.  Just too fiddly of a system to ever expect I will be able to enjoy a campaign.

One of the top dungeon crawl/adventure games I've played.
The game kind of solves the most issues I have with these kinds of games.
Downtime is reduced by alternating between hero and overlord activations.
Player elimination and overlord focusing on single characters is greatly reduced by the use of "wounded" status.
Of course, the combat resolution is still (compared to Descent) crazy random.

Aside from some MB Game Master games in my youth, this is my first experience into the heavily thematic game genre.  I was very hesitant at first as the rules were cumbersome and poorly worded.  But the gameplay has proven to be a lot of fun.  Sure it is highly thematic, (which I guess translates to, you spend a lot of time beating on the other guy rather than optimizing your position) but for the singular experience that it has brought, it is worth the effort.

Really neat "skirmish format" game when players go through the adventure, level up, shoot baddies, all the while I try to create "big enough" an obstacle for them. It scratches my role player itch just enough - with self-added freedom of modifying scenarios just a little bit to add more flavors, and steer map draws just a bit to go where it could be interesting.
I wonder if it will hold after we finish the campaign.

RATING: 2
Repetitive.  The intellectual property (it is better than Descent because it is Star Wars skin/theme) is the only reason this game is ranked so highly.  If you don't believe me but are curious as to whether I am right: good for you.  This uses the same mechanics seen in Descent, Descent 2, Gears of War, Doom, and the list continues.  Fantasy Flight makes tweaks here and there and changes the game into more of a campaign mode than earlier games.  Bottom line - the game is the same.  You could write the "progression" of players into quests in Descent without campaign mode.  Regardless that isn't the most important point.

The combat is repetitive, it doesn't matter if it is Darth Vader, an AT-ST, E-Web, or storm trooper.  The number of dice are different and the variety a bit, but it is the same combat over and over and over.  The game is almost exclusively about combat with interludes that are illusions of non-combat.  Kill this person, kill these terminals, area control these zones (you control by killing people).

The game isn't strategy, it is tactics.  Even that is being generous.  The white die is the worst die in the game.  It goes from block 0 damage to block infinite damage (ALL).  Realistically that means you could take 8 wounds or 0 wounds (1/6 chance of either event.  That spread makes luck a dominant factor.  The black defense die is the best, it goes from 0 to 3 as the spread of how much it blocks.  I am too much in the details, but the game is basically a poor version of craps.

It is beautiful, if I rated a game on beauty and how great star wars is then I would give this game a 9 or 10.  Problem is it is a game and not a dollhouse.  It makes a great dress up dolls experience, but not a good or even OK board game.

RATING: N/A
Proud owner...but I cannot find ANYBODY to play with...

UPDATE: Still haven't played so I won't rate but I've been discouraged about getting this game out the more I read and the more I get confused by it. After a few solo practices, I can say that I can find the skirmishes fun, but I foresee problems with the setup, stacks of fiddly components (not the minis sans the droids), dozens of stacks of cards and all of the effort to explain new players two books of rules just to shoot at a couple of storm troopers and achieve small objectives. I put a fair amount of investment into this based on word-of-mouth alone but I think I have buyer's remorse...

ANOTHER UPDATE: And I'm rid of it. Traded.

YET ANOTHER UPDATE: I'm now officially torn because I want her back!

THIS IS RIDICULOUS: I've bounced back and forth on this, but I'm ultimately going to move on. I wouldn't get anyone willing to commit to a campaign anyway...

Multiple skirmish games played, haven't even touched the campaign. 
Highly tactical, lots of variation on each mission and each is disgustingly different, even when played on same map. Also nice variations on actual troops, even if Mercenary faction needs more figures. Highly recommended for fans of tactical combat.

Played through the campaign as imperial - fun as hell, but would still like to have fully co-op experience. Hoping for similar app as with Descent 2nd edition.

I've played the first mission twice (trying to find a group to play a campaign with). It is an excellent game and seems to improve on Descent in many ways. Keeping the mission objectives secret makes the game unique (I'm not sure if Descent had that rule too, but if it did we didn't play it like that). The game's mechanics are simply tools to accomplish a thematic objective. I can't think of another game that accomplishes this. Some players dislike the hidden objective rule, but I find it very thematic. Plus, if it's anything like Descent, knowing the objective ahead of time would almost make the game boring. 

The threat system makes the Imperial player (which I played once) feel like they have real choices to make. I think this is an improvement over Descent's Overlord Card system, since the Rebel players can account for the increasing threat and aren't randomly caught off guard by certain events. However, our normal Overlord/Emperor seems to prefer the Overlord card system (he's never played the good guys, so that might account for it). 

The components, as always, are beautiful. I have painted all of the core minis (pictures are on by BGG user page gallery) and had a wonderful time doing it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Core set has incredible value. Truly a FFG core set game that requires no expansions for the full experience.

Streamlined dungeon crawler design. Just the right amount of rules to keep round-to-round admin minimal and not get in the way of action. Essentially you don't get the feeling that a computer should be doing all this math.

Finally the most dynamic sculpts of any miniatures game. In many other games, the miniatures are posing rather than striking. In Imperial Assault, all the sculpts are in the midst of performing an action lending to the imagination of a chaotic fire-fight.

Loved the gameplay of Decent, but the theme was not quite my taste.  Also games like it tend to take a long time.  Being an ex-warmachine player, I didn't want to get another game that could take hours and hours just for one game.  Then I heard about imperial assault skirmish rules for tactical combat.  It caught my attention and then eventually I picked it up.  I am so stoked to play this!

In a nutshell, this game is flawed, but fun. If you can look past the rules oddities (easier to do if you're a die-hard SW fan) and the way the gameplay can swing wildly in favor of one side or the other, you might enjoy this. Among the many complaints: Heroes can run through or past formations of stormtroopers with impunity; they get hit with blaster fire 20+ times and are only "wounded" (not that you can tell); they CAN'T die or be captured no matter what happens. This results in some crazy tactical decisions since there's really nothing to fear by running into a field of overwhelming firepower. Clearly, there are "game reasons" for these rules, but they do not fit the theme. Not a game to be taken too seriously. Looks like it's a big hit, so FFG will get rich selling unpainted plastic minis at ten bucks a pop. (Seriously?)

I've played through a campaign of this (as a hero) and a campaign of Descent 2.0 (as the Overlord). Both were lots of fun but had the same problem (for me): As the characters get more and more special abilities, the game becomes more complicated and each quest/mission/battle moves slower than the last. The result is the campaign gets less fun as it goes on. Still, the games are fun -- I think the campaigns start out as an 8 and end up a 6, thus the 7 rating. I like the fantasy theme better, but I think Star Wars plays a bit quicker.

First of all, the components for this game are incredible. Never been one for painting mini figures until I got this. 

That said, there is so much to digest in order to play this games campaign and that means time. We were 5 hours on first campaign and really damaged my perception of the game. We have played a few skirmish games minus the full rule set and they are decent fun.

I love Star Wars. Ok, now that we got that out of the way...

I love board games! 

I love character building! And story! And tactical movement/combat! And puzzle solving! And miniatures!

This game is essentially a Star Wars rpg-lite boardgame, and it does a fantastic job of realizing that experience. I think it's great the way it blends elements of character building and story from rpgs into a mechanically tight system that works for a board game. The way the campaign is structured into missions and side missions, with a branching story, gives the game a narrative breadth that eclipses most board gaming experiences, while the mechanics of the game are fun in their own right. It's exciting to play, and to not know what might be around the corner, or behind that door, and winning or losing the game really comes down to making good choices at key moments. 

It also does a lovely job at creating that Star Wars feel and atmosphere as well, which goes a long way in garnering my appreciation for the game. It's a lot of fun.

A Star Wars retheme of the Descent system, along with some tweaks to the rule set.  Two versions of the game are included, one being a multiple session campaign and another being a standalone skirmish game.

RATING: 7
Setup is a pain. The rules can be cumbersome the first 5 times through. Not so much the main game rules but all the little sub-rules on each card. have to keep checking the reference manual until you have everything memorized. The skirmishes are fun some but some of the characters, Luke and Vader, just dominate the game. We are about to start a campaign so I am hoping that helps how I feel about the game. I love star wars so i love miniatures and theme but it seems more and more like i am not liking miniature games. I will say i am really looking forward to buying the cards that automate the Imperial Forces so we can all play as the rebels.

**UPDATE** Played first mission in core campaign and bumped my rating up one. Setup is still a pain but rules are much easier after a few play throughs. Like the leveling up of both sides after campaign missions.

Great fun!

Fluent play, not overburdened with rules and exceptions.

My one of two games (along with Star Trek: Fleet Captains) with minis (and I certainly don't plan to buy more).

--

The balance of some scenarios (the most notable examples: Fly Solo and Temptation) is ridiculous...  The light side is SO disadvantaged in them... :-/// (at least in 2-player mode).  To whoever created these unbalanced scenarios: TEST, TEST, TEST the game for ALL allowed player counts!!! (or start digging f*cking ditches instead)

RATING: 8
Initial rating one play only

I wasn't big on trying this at first knowing it was just a Descent re-skin (turns out it feels like a mix of Earth Reborn & Descent and almost more like the former), but it is SW afterall, and I wanted to see for myself if enough theme comes through to justify a purchase or not, short answer: still unsure

So I liked the mechanics for the most part which was not a surprise having played Descent in the past, and this version is pretty streamlined for FFG but of course it is the 3rd or 4th version so you would have hoped they would get it right (well, the first time would be nice really and without need of expansions to fix...) but there are a few questionable rules/tactics there too so its still not perfect but pretty good. Apparently most of the missions can be played in 2 or 3 hours, I like this and combined with the streamlining and only 13 pages of rules it should make it fairly easy to table. The biggest plus for me though was the game was damn fun [i]and[/i] had a nice bunch of decisions to make too, and not just campaign based, actual in-game decisions became interesting and damn tense at times too. I thought the Rules reference book was a great addition to FFG games, unfortunately it was not quite as comprehensive as it should have been so still need a really good FAQ and there is still some cross-referencing as a result too so a PITA there, but it was great to be able to really easily and quickly find most stuff, hopefully they will work on perfecting this in future because itâs a great concept. 

The scenario I played 2 player was just the intro one but was pretty neat, the imperial player had some tricks up his sleeve (like a DM where only he knows like Descent) that is sure to catch the Rebels off guard and make their life interesting and more challenging at the same time. Also great here is the time element, as the rebel player I was really under the gun to keep moving, without this the tension would have been way way less so this was a great addition here imo. At the end of the scenario I had to race into the final room, bruised and bloodied and out of time completely and my mission all came down to one dice roll so it felt very polished/balanced and damn tense and fun overall.  

From what I know the Campaign seems interesting enough, and this is almost always a nice draw/addition in a game where you have some choices on how to upgrade/shape your character for future missions etc. So the big question left for me was does the theme really come out enough in the game? To me, so far it feels like a combined crawl/tactical minis game with all the theme applied through text, unlike something like Queens Gambit where it really âfeelsâ like a star wars game (and not a dungeon crawl). The thing is QG only had one mission, but itâs a damn thematic good one (game has too much luck though). Here we have many missions, and even a campaign which is great but are they really star wars based? Well first mission seemed pretty generic, and apparently none of them play out scenes from the movies which to me is disappointing. I mean if we could try to rescue Solo from Jabba, now [i]this[/i] would feel thematic, and sure fans can come up with this stuff but why do we even have to go this route, jeepers. Yes you do get to "somewhat" use some of the big characters here (not as your main guy though) and you are playing in the SW universe I guess (text read aloud revolves around it) but I think much more could have been done to bring the theme out. 

So to sum up, by far the Best SW "boardgame" (not counting pure "ship" or card games) to date with no close competitor (QG & Assault on Hoth runners up but both too simple & too much luck), but I hope they do something original and much more thematic with the universe, we need more simulation otherwise it just feels tacked on with a bunch of flavor text. As I somewhat mentioned it really does almost remind me more of Earth Reborn (tactical minis game) than Descent, but it definitely feels like both to me anyway and still retains some crawl feel. No idea on skirmish game myself (apparently good) but not that interested either, the campaign game is what I want to play if playing. Likely remain between 7 and 9 for me depending on richness of campaign and if I see more theme integration (not just a bunch of text), would have been easy 9 for me with more theme. As usual for me this is a 2 player only game, but I think will work very well for 3 players too and would happily play it 3. If I didnât own Earth Reborn I would jump on this, now the decision is a little harder since my shelf space is so tight, and they do scratch a VERY similar itch.

I've invested so much time and money into a game that I've hardly played.  I honestly can't say how good this game is since I've barely scratched the surface but I've been completely enamored with it nonetheless.  I have all of the expansions and I've painted many of them and still don't plan to really dive in until I'm done painting. Until them, I love the idea of the game and look forward to finishing and finally playing it for real.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (January 2015)

I really like Descent (Second Edition) and as Imperial Assault is very Descent derivative I was sure I was going to love the game (right now I like it, but it has a lot of potential). Besides Star Wars is my favorite theme EVER so buying the game was a no brainer for me.

When I got my game, I was surprised to see a box so big. The game was much more expensive than I initially thought, but the game components are truly great, the miniatures are awesome and I have never seen a game that came with four different game manuals. Great job on the game component FFG.

So far I have only played the tutorial mission twice but it was very simple for us (and very difficult for the rebel payers), Iâm still glad it is there so it is easy to explain the game to new gamers, but if you are a seasoned Descent player you could perhaps begin with the campaign mode right away. The tutorial mission is also great because you can play the game after 30 minutes of unpacking it.

After playing it I noticed some differences between Imperial Assault and Descent, most prominent the heroes now can die (be defeated) and be out of the current scenarios, this is handled a la Earth Reborn in which the players get hurt first and they lose some abilities and if you hurt them again they are out. I really like this because it makes more thematic sense. Also all the minis can now move twice. 
 
Iâm also excited to see that the game came with a second mode of play (Skirmish) only for two players. I have to play it soon. 

Bottom line, Iâm sure that when I play the campaign mode (and the skirmish mode) the rating will go up. Iâm also sure this will be a huge money pit but I donât really care about that. On the other hand, Iâm not sure if I will keep it as I bought around 15 copies of the game for my friends and after I have played a campaign I usually donât have any desire to replay it. Perhaps the Skirmish mode can save the game for me, or perhaps I will keep it because it is Star Wars. We will see. I think Imperial Assaultis the best Star Wars game currently in print (I havenât played some of the OOP games), miles better than X-wing and better than the Card Game. 

According to my 2015 game commitments I need to play more campaign games so I think Imperial Assault will be it.

Current Rating: 7.0

I recently realized that this kind of game doesnât appeal to me anymore. Itâs been a long time since I last played Imperial Assault, but more important, my desire to do so is very low. Now I feel the game offers lots of work for a very small return in joy. If I never play the game again I wonât be sad.

How can you lose by taking Descent 2nd edition and reskinning it with Star Wars? You can't, that's how. This game takes all the good things about Descent and makes it better. My only complaint is that since the theme and setting are so familiar, it makes things frustrating sometimes because you're not able to do things you really want to do when you want; getting the lightsaber for the Jedi apprentice, for example. Generic-setting fantasy games don't have the same feelings.

Ugh.  So much promise.  I so looked forward to this game.  Unfortunately, the game play is uninspiring.  One example - I know my opponent wants to come thru this door.  I want to put my guys in overwatch on it - except I am not allowed to do that.  He was able to run thru the door and then attack me first.  I still won the game, but the whole system was weak.  It reminded me of playing Panzerblitz as a kid (not the tank part, the no Op Fire part).  Seriously, no one during playtest raised an issue?  The game would be nothing without the franchise and the money thrown at components.  See Star Wars: Rebellion if you are looking for amazingly high component values AND great game play.

Rebel players use their character's abilities to try and defeat the one playing the Empire, either in one-on-one skirmishes or groups of players in scenarios (which in multiples become a campaign), using dice-based combat. Base box is expensive but comes with a lot: a variety of terrain, cards for each character to guide play, six hero minis, many more Imperials -- including an AT-ST! -- plus Luke and Vader figure packs, which show you the value of getting them beyond just the minis (scenarios too). However, it also comes with FOUR manuals, and you will find yourself returning to the reference manual which explains all the key terms in better detail than the introductory manuals.

PLUS: large variety of options in the base set, scenarios are really challenging
MINUS: cost

EXTRA PLUS: further figure sets mean that the game will have a long future of options

The first time I played this the game was ruined by another player dragging the game out arguing over rules wording and constantly making the guy check the rulebook.

Played a 2 player game with my mate after 3/4 months since the last play as I was not interested at all in playing again, now I would be happy to play two player any time.

RATING: 7
I hated Descent 2.0, and this improves on Descent in practically every way despite being adapted from the same system.

Allowing movement through enemies changes the game from "quick, run to the goal before we get blocked by monsters" (Descent) to a tactical skirmish with interesting choices (Imperial Assault).

That goes in hand with another big change to the mission design. In Descent, almost every quest is a race, and the overlord player often has a divergent goal. The teams don't even really care what the other side is doing as long as they're doing it quicker. In Imperial Assault the Imperial player is fighting directly against the Rebels in almost every mission, with the win condition being "wound all four Rebel players".

Speaking of wounds, Descent's hero death is a joke. Heroes can spring back up on the next turn with no penalty. In Imperial Assault, not only is Rebel death part of the victory condition for the Imperial side, but being wounded actually changes the stats and abilities of the Rebel players! It's a thematic and dramatic element that Descent sorely lacks.

Imperial Assault adds more drama and tactics by allowing the Rebel and Imperial players to alternate turns. In Descent, all the heroes take their turns before the overlord even gets a chance to do anything. This often results in anticlimactic situations where the overlord summons a fantastic creature (e.g. master Shadow Dragon) only to watch it be slain before its first action. In Imperial Assault that rarely happens, and the Rebel players have to consider which enemy groups have acted when deciding who to target next.

The heroes killed a master Shadow Dragon, they should at least get some pleasure out of killing such a large beast, right? No, in Descent, the reinforcement rules often mean the overlord can simply revive the monster on the next turn. This further encourages the heroes to run for the goal and ignore the overlord. In Imperial Assault, the reinforcements are chosen by the Imperial player and arrive in groups so the Rebel players never know what to expect.

Further to that point, the campaign book in Imperial Assault is private information. Only the Imperial player knows what's coming. This again adds drama and tension to the mission.

Descent, with some rules re-writing, quest re-balancing and player co-operation, could be a good game, but I'm not willing to put the time and effort required to make it so, especially when Imperial Assault does everything better.

SUMMARY

DESCENT:

* Hero death is insignificant; they spring back up on the next turn
* Monsters can be wiped out before the Overlord even gets to use them
* Quests are unbalanced - it always feels like one side had no chance to win
* Quests are usually a race between the Heroes and the Overlord
* The Overlord's quest goal is often unrelated to the heroes, so both sides tend to avoid each other
* Reinforcements are predictable (usually one per turn) and weak
* Overlord card effects feel weak and insignificant
* Overlord cards are difficult to remember (there are 15 cards in the deck)
* Quest information is public, encouraging players to game the system instead of role-play
* Monsters completely block hero movement
* Line of sight is convoluted
* Figures can miss an attack (1 in 6 chance), which is anticlimactic
* Movement around corners when a monster is present feels unfair
* Large monster movement ("shrinking") feels silly and unfair
* Fatigue-movement feels unfair
* Heroes choose the quest order, so there's no chance for a linear story progression
* There isn't much story to follow anyway - the flavor text for each quest is sparse
* Travel is unrewarding and nearly flavorless

IMPERIAL ASSAULT:

* Rebels first become wounded (with reduced stats) and then withdraw from the mission entirely if they "die" a second time
* The Imperial player activates one group of enemies after each Rebel player
* Missions are incredibly balanced, often being decided in the final turn
* Quests have a bit more variety, and you are often racing a clock instead of each other
* The Imperial goal is usually just to stop the Rebels (all four Rebel players wounded)
* Reinforcements arrive in groups purchased (with threat points) by the Imperial player
* Agenda cards are purchased by the Imperial player and have stronger effects
* The Imperial player starts with 0 cards, so they are learned by all as the campaign unfolds
* Only the Imperial player sees the campaign book
* Enemy figures slow player movement, but never block it completely
* Line of sight is improved (although can still be frustrating if the players don't all understand them)
* Certain (nimble) figures can dodge an attack (1 in 6 chance), which is a bit more exciting and happens less often
* The movement around corners problem still exists, but doesn't come up as often because of how the maps are laid out, and because the Rebel players are usually not trying to avoid the monsters to race to the finish line
* Updated movement rules for large monsters make a bit more sense (no more "shrinking")
* Strain-movement is limited to two spaces per turn.
* Strain is also a more precious resource than fatigue due to how tight the mission balance is
* The Rebel players still choose the next mission, but the choice is more interesting for both sides
* It's still hard to follow the story, but each mission has decent flavor
* No travel

Skirmish is cool, but fiddly. Playing CMON games made me realize what a waste all those extra spaces on the board are. Building an arena takes AGES, and often they feel bare - there's little to interact with other than corners, and it just feels very wasted.

I hated the campaign, but maybe it's because I was the empire and my units kept melting under the combined firepower of the heroes; might get batter later on in the campaign. I would love to play this with my son, but he's too young for it. In a few years we'll have a go again.

finally got in a play!  (4 players total and the first mission).   Rather enjoyed it.  it isn't deep, but so far it is quite fun and VERY thematic.  Put on that SW soundtrack in the background and start role playing to enjoy this one as much as possible.  

A good game so far.  Excited to try the rest of the campaign.  Painting my figures.

Played a skirmish with Luis.   Great fun.  not sure what the knock is from others on this one.  Offers about as much Star Wars theme as I've even encountered and the mechanics are sound.  I enjoyed it in skirmish mode just fine, though the Campaign is still slightly more exciting for me after one play of each.   

After two campaign missions, I still like it, but I can also see how it takes a little longer than perhaps it should.  More after next mission.

The other ratings are a two high (spelling intentional). I understand theme is an important part of a (American) game but should the theme really raise a 7.5 up to 9.5 because they branded Star Wars on it? 
Feels like this game is way over-rated for what it is. Yes, the game is good, the components are good (and you certainly pay for them). But the way people are acting, they could thrown out their collections and never need to play any other game again.

Played one campaign where the Imperials ran away with the game.  Overall, it felt too much like a D&D dungeon crawler and not enough like Star Wars.  Having heroes who can absorb half a dozen blaster bolts (and who get better by crouching behind an object and shedding some strawberry jam) just didn't feel Star Wars-ish to me, and I didn't like a game system where most attacks hit.

Edit: After playing the Twin Shadows mini-campaign, I dropped it two more points.  The 8 round limit used in most scenarios feels unnecessary given the Imperial players' unlimited reinforcements and the game is too much about playing 'stupid' and running pell mell towards the objectives for me to enjoy it.  Balance also feels like hot garbage as the Imperials ran away with both campaigns despite early Rebel victories.

Rules are the latest variation of FFG's house system (Doom/Descent/Mutant Chronicles) - I think I preferred the MC incarnation, which put a higher premium on attack accuracy.  A lot of the interactions among cards are sloppy and not that well defined, which was a surprise given how often FFG has already gone to this well.

Plays like descent that doesn't suck! I will admit this gets at least 3 points for theme + component quality, as I generally dislike player vs DM type games. Will update after more plays. Update - The player vs DM is surprisingly well balanced and the campaign plays out nicely, although there is a lot to keep track of between sessions with all the components. The Skirmish mode bumps this up another half point, it's a total blast. Traded away to a friends who are more star wars fans than I who can bring it by whenever I want to play it.

I'm normally not a campaign based board game player.  I'd rather play a roleplaying game.  But this game is about as good as it gets.  The rules are familiar, have some strategy and are easy enough to teach to people who don't normally game.  

I like that every piece is dual-purpose, so even if you don't like campaign games, you can just duke it out in skirmish mode, or vice versa.

(Update after 3 years of campaigns)
I feel that most campaign missions feel too rushed.  My biggest complaint is that the games donât feel fun anymore.  They feel tedious.  I still think skirmish adds a lot, but I think campaign falls apart over the course of time.

I love this game! My husband and I play this game with our 12 year old and love it. The only expansion I will not buy is "Heart of the Empire" because I want to keep the game to the original three movies. I hate the prequels. My husband plays the Empire exclusively and dislikes setting up the board due to having to search for the correct tiles for the campaign. I love having a game that will beat us at times.

Excellent game. It's a reskinned Descent.
I don't know both games well enough to point where this does stuff better or worse but both are fun. 
I personally prefer the SW heroes (they seem to have more character) but do prefer the fantasy villains/foes (again, they seem to posses more character).

Haven't tried the skirmish mode. If that works well then this would eke out just slightly over Descent (since a good 1v1 mode was missing there) but otherwise I prefer Descent.

Descent + Star Wars?   Shut Up and take my money!

Actually got to play this at BGG Con 2014, the next day I ordered it and every available expansion pack... now the hard part, waiting by the mailbox.

Now that I own it, it's further from descent than I realized but the vast majority of the changes are a positive.

2016-03-13 - 8 - It's a rating after the first skirmish game. I don't think I will play the campaign anytime soon, but for a tactical miniatures game it's pretty good and I just think which expansions should I buy and why there must be so many of them.

RATING: 8
This is a good game! It's targeted toward a p&p enthusiast but also incorporates the boardgame aspect for those who aren't so good at suspending their disbelief. Please note depending on who you play with this game can cause confrontation as it plays just like a p&p and you have a gamemaster that can only tell you stuff based off your choices. So fun game but be careful who you play with.

Fun game! For the campaign mode, it would be a toss-up for me whether I would pick this or Descent.

The skirmish mode however is excellent! Games are quick and exciting. Playing with iconic Star Wars characters is icing on the cake.

I've only played co-op, with the Legends of the Alliance app.  This seems like quite an improvement over the Descent app, especially with respect to superior enemy behaviour.  The sense of urgency in the gameplay is also better suited to the Star Wars theme than that of a fantasy dungeon crawl.

Love Star Wars, love the idea, love the pieces, but this game is a big time and effort investment. There's so many little, fiddly rules that a single scenario playthrough can take hours. I'm sure with more playthroughs it runs smoother, but learning it is a chore and so is organizing it all. Keeping the same players each game can also be difficult. RPGs and dice rolling are becoming less attractive to me the more games I play as I'm not a fan of randomness determining important moments in a game. I'm also not a fan of the one vs. all mechanic as I like working all together or all separate. Loved the idea of the game but can't imagine bringing it to the table often.

This game is very frustrating to play.  When we first started playing I very much enjoyed it. But now I loathe playing it.   In the campaign I am playing in the rebels are steam rolling the Imperial player.  He is not enjoying the game at all and neither am I.

The line of sight and movement rules are terrible.  Down right awful. And the ability to rest twice and heal makes it a chore for the Imperial to do any real damage.  

Very disappointed in this game.

Thumbs down from me.

Fantastic dungeon crawler game in the Star Wars universe. The problems I can see is:

First experience with ia is the legends app. I have nothing to benchmark from but that was a blast. Lots of stuff to do for each player. Excited to finish the app campaign and might try the standard empire vs all mode eventually. Will keep.

Update 1 - After a few plays, the app has some serious AI issues.  We will finish the app, but likely follow-up with a 1vAll campaign eventually (after Gloomhaven).  The app is fun if you're on the fence about 1vAll, but I do not recommend it long term... just too fiddly for what it's worth.  I feel like a human player as Empire would speed the game up immensely for us.

Comments regarding the campaign mode: The setup is a barrier to play, and the game is very fiddly - there are so many things to keep track of, and every round someone forgets to apply the effect of some condition, or card, or situation, or something.

Star Wars + Descent = GREAT! It is basically Star Wars Descent, but it irons out so many issues with Descent that makes it just an amazing game. Even the Skirmish mode is amazing, so it is 2 in one games! 

There is just one big negative: You want to have all the expansions. You don't need them (the game is pretty much complete and justifies its price tag easily), but you are going to WANT them. All of them.

This is the prime example of what I do *not* want of a board game: tons of components, which translates into excruciating set-up times and even more bookkeeping. You spend almost as much time doing chores than actually playing. If this were a digital game, it could be played in ten minutes due to the lack of set up and bookkeeping. All that said, if you are a Star Wars fan and don't mind the downtime, do give it a try.

Amazing campaign mode that engages the characters with their own personal missions (eventually) to make for a (mostly) narrative storyline. Much-streamlined version of the Descent system. 2 games in one box with Skirmish mode. Great production values overall (natch, it's FFG).

However, this doesn't prevent the game from becoming rather clunky and slow. Even small missions are taking my group 4 hours to complete as the heroes try to optimize their way through the puzzle that is a mission. Fiddly mission rules can be easily forgotten by Heroes and lead to "tainted" missions. Imperial player spends a lot of time watching and waiting to be a victim to the rest of the players' plots.

I think my primary issue is with this form of tactical game overall - they're very calculating and that has to be from whence the fun derives.

Wanted to love it. Maybe over time (4 missions in) I will.

---Minor Spoilers Below---

Played: 

##1 v Many Campaign##

#1: Aftermath: Imperial Win. Rebels took too longer killing and not enough time destroying the terminals. 
#2: Loose Cannon: Easy Imperial Win. Rebels had to kill all the Imperial units and never really got close. Rebels loosing heart a bit but as the Imperial player i don't think they are playing to their strengths. 

Ended up abandoning it due to a couple of players not enjoying themselves as they felt the rebels had no chance.



##App Campaign##

- Enjoying so far - good add on. After the first mission everyone happy to try and get through the campaign

#1 - A couple of rules wrong but enjoyable intro. Held on OK. Pretty good little mission - something different.
#2 - Continued to be good. Nice sense of exploration.
#3 - Won fairly easily. An OK mission but probably the weakest so far.


##Skirmish##

Not tried yet but want to get to some day.

3. Not Being Star Wars(I kid, I kid)
4. Theme
5. A robust and well thought out campaign mode.

It plays well, and the Campaign mode is masterfully designed. It is the best designed Star Wars game ever.

It loses a point mainly to the abomination that is the box, I have a Plano Lockjaw for almost every component and have the skirmish stuff and the tiles in the box.

I can't really put my finger on it, but for some reason I just can't get 'into' this game. All the elements I like are there: Star Wars, character customisation, campaign game-play, loot, ...
It's not because it's a one-vs-many game, because I do like those, most of the time. It could the way the Dark Side has all information and the Rebels have no clue as to what's going to happen. It just feels imbalanced towards the Dark Side. Though since I joined in, the Rebels haven't lost a single mission. Maybe it's because there's now three Rebels, or maybe it's because of our now highly aggressive playing style: rush to objective, then rush out. Which isn't all that fun either, honestly.

Descent with Star Wars.  Great combination.  I feel this version is more stressful as everything seems to be timed.  Much more challenging as a "Game", but I still like the "Adventure" feel of Descent.

Update 12/4/17: They came out with a co-op/solo app for this game. This fixes everything!

Update 6/4/16: Wanted to like this game but couldn't finish a full campaign due to frustration. While the board and minis are beautiful and look great on the table, each mission takes A LOT of time to set up. The narrative arc is nice and I like the theme, but the game play provides very little depths to strategy and very few interesting decisions. This is a hard pass in my opinion. If you want an awesome Star Wars game with minis, play rebellion.

A couple plays through the tutorial. The tutorial was a really easy puzzle for the imperials to win every time, so we are hoping that the campaign will prove to be a bit more interesting.

MINIATURES! I got this because it had the starwars theme, but I didn't play any boardgames at that time. Took me a year to find people and the courage to try the game out as the imperial player. We were all newbies. We missed tons of rules, but we're halfway through the campaign now and finally getting to know everything. Heroes are unstoppable kinda, but it's still tons of fun. I really like the addition to play skirmish and to add the miniatures you like. Don't like the speed at which they are releasing stuff, but meh, wouldn't have the money to buy everything anyway ^^

This game...
There are moments that are wonderful, my gaming group played through the entire first campaign in 48 hours. 
It really captures what I believe are the best parts of Star Wars (space battles are boring, I'm looking at you 7 and 8) and puts them in a box.

However...
Some of the scenarios are brutally (difficult?) unfair for the rebels and when we lost the campaign we were all left feeling really disappointed. I think it is poor game design to have a 1v4 scenario that has an 80% loss rate... The DM didn't like it, we didn't like, but apparently they have fixed the imbalance in some of the expansions.

RATING: 7
Imperial Assault puts you in the midst of the Galactic Civil War between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire after the destruction of the Death Star over Yavin 4. In this game, you and your friends can participate in two separate games. The campaign game pits the limitless troops and resources of the Galactic Empire against a crack team of elite Rebel operatives as they strive to break the Empireâs hold on the galaxy, while the skirmish game invites you and a friend to muster strike teams and battle head-to-head over conflicting objectives.

As an additional benefit, the Luke Skywalker Ally Pack and the Darth Vader Villain Pack are included within the Imperial Assault Core Set. These figure packs offer sculpted plastic figures alongside additional campaign and skirmish missions that highlight both Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader within Imperial Assault. With these Imperial Assault Figure Packs, you'll find even more missions that allow your heroes to fight alongside these iconic characters from the Star Wars saga.

I love this game. One of the best dungeon crawlers I've played, even before adding the amazing Star Wars elements on top of it. The campaign is high stakes and extremely rewarding through both the main missions and side missions. With the skirmishes, the balance and depth makes it one of my favorite two player games out there. And with the newly released companion app, I can now play it as a fully co-op game with my group who was hesitant before. Seriously love almost everything about it!

After one full campaign where I was the IMP, I didn't really enjoy myself the last few missions where I felt I had no shot. Perhaps another go would change my perspective, but I'm not certain I really want to play again. 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This feels very much like Descent with a Star Wars theme loosely tacked on to the game. It works, but I can't say it feels anything like Star Wars. I do prefer the back and forth movement where a hero activates and then a villain group activates which continues until all groups activate. The damage dealt seems greater than in original Descent but perhaps I'm just imagining things there. The maps are tiny and there is not much room to maneuver or at least so it feels. Unless I'm missing something, I'm not sure the Empire acquires strength that quickly but we're still early in the campaign so we'll see.

I have tried both editions of Descent and I have to say this is a much better implementation than either of those behemoths. Out of the box there are definitely a lot of options to play with with both a skirmish mode and a campaign mode to play with. The components, per usual for FFG, are the best in the business. Models are all very detailed and made with some of the best plastic in the business. Colors and distinguishing marks on the map tiles all stand out. The map tiles were done brilliantly and offer a wide variety of possibilities in map generation. Out of the box there are about 40 missions to play, although you may only experience a fraction of those in a campaign. Overall the rules are well done, with one nagging problem of some strange Line of Sight rules that have been pointed out in many different forum posts. My biggest complaint with the game is that it really doesn't feel like Star Wars. All the Star Wars trappings are there, and the models look like they belong in the Star Wars universe, but ultimately what I did in the missions and what actions i took didn't feel anything like the world we have all come to know and love. What you did get was definitely an interesting tactical miniatures game, with a really nice campaign system and numerous choices for the Overlord player. What you didn't get was anything close to an experience of being in one of the movies, and that is a big miss in my book. Overall I definitely enjoyed the game, and would like to play more, but I am glad I didn't purchase this game especially knowing that they will just be doing serial purchases for this game from now on.

This is essentially Descent 2.5, and that's a good thing! I've played this for several groups, and everyone has always loved it. I think the theme appeals to a wider audience than Descent, and I like what changes they did make (not many) to the Descent rules. The miniatures are top notch, as are the tiles. The only game with higher quality tiles is Space Hulk. 

Huge fan. Would play any time.

Much of its appeal comes from the star wars license. It's an all right game on its own, but I admit the main reason I play it is to move storm troopers around and shout "pew pew" at my friends' rebels.
Would strongly benefit from a native cooperative mode. One gets a bit tired of always being the "GM".

* About the CAMPAIGN mode:

** Type of game:

$ Miniatures dungeon crawler.

- Most similar game I played: Earth Reborn. Very similar: squad-level skirmishes on usual real life terrain with miniatures in two camps, and missions. However, I prefer the smaller number of figures in Earth Reborn, which makes turns go faster. I also prefer the breadth of flavors in the actions and game play of Earth Reborn. Imperial Assault has the advantage of having an important 1 vs many mode (a la Descent).

$ Somewhat similar game: Space Hulk. But Space Hulk is about a cramped terrain. There is less variety in the maps of Space Hulk, or in the characters, or in the events (no events in Space Hulk). But I like the claustrophobic setting.

$ Somewhat similar game: Claustrophobia. But Claustrophobia is simpler, more streamlined, and the characters move at a much bigger scale.

$ Somewhat similar game: Warhammer: Diskwars. I prefer Diskwars: it is richer in terms of unit powers, tactical choices, and has a nice guessing element (secret goals, command cards).

Pros:

+ Streamlined rules. Easy to pick up. The game can be started by knowing only the main rules, and some details can be explained on the go.

+ Good game flow. The Rebels can confer with each other, which alleviates downtime.

+ 30 missions. I like not knowing what will happen, and the game is replete with unexpected reinforcements and events.

+ The characters have a distinct personality, which is nice for strategizing and making everybody participate to the fight for victory.

+ Very good material. Nice sculpts (not at the level of Space Hulk 20th anniversary edition, with a plastic which is less dense, and shows more mold marks, but very detailed sculpts).

* Cons

- I found the breadth of the decisions a little lacking, for all the glitter: while I liked evaluating the relative strengths of the various threats, developing strategies and make tactical decisions about movement, finding synergies between the characters and using their respective strengths, I almost get the same kind of pleasure from a game like BattleLore on iPad. In a similar category of games, I prefer the thematic richness of Earth Reborn.

- Detail: the stats could use some icons: this would make the first games easier (by allowing the Rebels to quickly spot where is the life of the Imperial troops, etc.).

First two missions of the campain were kinda "fun", or at least OK to bare for those several hours spent. But when I realised that the full campaign (side missions included) is literaly the same roll-move-roll game, it made me regret all the time I've invested into it. Never, ever again anything like that. It's just a pointles waste of time.

I did finish the campain though, since I didn't really want my group down.

Imperial Assault is a fantastic game that Iâd recommend to anyone whoâs a fan of either board games and/or strategy games. And may God have mercy on your wallet if youâre either of those things and a big Star Wars fan, because the conveyor belt of expansions and fresh figures will be grinding onwards for years to come and paint your minis in the mean time it makes the game look even better.

One of the best game in this genre. It's simplier then Descent(first edition) which we played a lot in the past and much better then Descent(second edition). Game is quite balanced. Game master and players have chances to win. Main disadvantages:
- Still requere some time to create game board(specially with all tiles from addons)
- Game is the best for 4 players + game master. Three players get additional activation which ruins some misions,
- I don't like the way game blance itself by giving more complicated missions to players if they win the previous one. In some cases it's better to lose to get easier mission at the end.

The campaign is a blast.  I've never played a game that came down to final dice rolls or tactical decisions so often.  

Just got a skirmish play in and I have to say it is also fantastic.  If you've read the scene in the Harry Potter books where they play life size wizards chess...that's this.  You get the thinky chess tactical feel, but the pawns feel alive with their special abilities.  The card play in skirmish really brings it to life.

The latest iteration of the Descent engine - and it shows, in a good way!
The change in play sequence - alternating activations - does it all. No longer are problems to be analysed from end to end. Instead you need to prioritise, because your  opponent will have an activation before you can take your next one yourself.

Play balance in the campaign still seems to be a bit of a problem: Consensus is that the Imperial player has the upper hand. So for lasting appeal, The immperial might have to pull his punches a bit, which really isn't optimal, as you can end up feeling a bit cheated, even when winning.

Adding miniatures is not really enough for me to rate a game thematic.  I don't feel any immersion.  This game could be wooden cubes and storyless and I would enJoy it the same amount.

Thing is, I still really like it.  If this combat system came in an rpg instead of a board game it would be a 10.  After half a campaign I'm satisfied and feel no urge to delve deeper.

RATING: 8
Despite liking fantasy more than space the added skirmish mode almost effectively adds another game to get more bang for your buck, as you can customize your command cards and which units you use. Also, the changes from Descent makes good thematic sense (you can never fail an attack with a blaster but light units are fast enough to dodge, range is now accuracy since a blaster should have near infinite range).

In terms of the campaign the overlord's role has changed to be nearly no card play and instead much more focus on units. The back and forth activation rather than all the heroes go first means the heroes can't just wipe out a third of the overlord's forces before he/she has even gone, and that the overlord can spawn in batches now instead of one at a time is both more realistic and also helps prevent his/her units from being picked off one by one. Instead of having healing characters now anybody can heal themselves via resting. Some things that seemed really powerful in the original (fatiguing really far to get off multiple attacks that could potentially remove your fatigue, blast) have been weakened. 

There also used to be the problem that if someone died the overlord would just camp a monster on its corpse to make it difficult for the hero revive, whereas now you just become wounded and become weaker so that your game isn't practically over, and while killing you once and for all will eliminate you from the current scenario, the overlord is incentivized to attack everyone because if everyone is wounded that is also a win condition.

Finally, only part of the events for each campaign is revealed to the heroes initially, which I think makes your first run through more exciting, while in the future one could instead be more strategic and plan around these traps.

It's pretty impossible to give a single scoring to this game.
It's pricey but you get two games in a single one, the campaign and the skirmish.
Campaign wise is a really nice system, will last quite a lot of sessions and has still a bit of replayability (though the best is being surprised by the things that happen).
If you have quite a lot of bucks to shell, the expansions will add other miniatures, characters, and new campaign and more and more hours of fun.

Haven't yet played in skirmish mode.

2014 Christmas present from Teri. I am currently 5 missions into a campaign playing as the imperials. I am having a lot of fun with this and am using my Star Wars Miniatures figures instead. This feels great, is a good retheme of Descent and I have not even touched the skirmish mode and am happy with it!

Campaigns: 1 base game, won as Imperials
Skirmish: 1

Update: I love this game. Yes the missions are sometimes imbalanced, but the story makes up for it.

Finished 2 full core campaigns and 1 expansion campaign.  I love this game!  It feels like Star Wars skirmish fighting.  The Empire side is strong and menacing and the rebels have to hit and run trying to achieve the goal.   Many of the scenarios have come down to one roll near the end of the mission to determine the winner, building the tension and excitement. I raised the score from 8 to 9 because I love this game more every time I play.  If they come out with a full coop and single player mode with the app, it will have to bump to a 10.

Great tactical game, excellent mechanics, only downside is repetitive missions (each mission feels the same - objective grab) and cash grab due to additional content (cca 70$ each quarter, some content should be in the core game to start with and once you start investing in this game you simply can't stop).

Has 2p skirmish also which is great, but there isn't much variety in core game for 2p skirmish out of the same boy (expansions are must).

Short note on the history and evolution of this game and its mechanics:

-> Doom: The Board Game + expansions
-> Descent: Journeys in the Dark + expansions
-> Descent: Journeys in the Dark 2. Edition + expansions
-> Star Wars: Imperial Assault

The game mechanics have evolved over several years and many, many expansions. There is no doubt that SW:IA is a very well designed game.

However, I don't enjoy this game as much as I hoped I would. I guess I was looking for a Dungeon Crawler (like Descent) only in a Star Wars setting. As it turns out it is and definitely plays like a tactical miniatures war game and I was not looking for that kind of game.

Even though they did not change much compared to Descent, the few changes do make this game seem a lot more tactical, which sounds good, but ultimately ruins this game for me. You find yourself planing and analyzing a lot, which slows the game down quite a bit. But the worst part in my opinion is that the game seems to only create an "illusion" of being tactical. Ultimately it is still just a "move guy, roll a guy"- type of game. It is far to heavy for actually not offering that much in my opinion.

Also, the campaign never really caught my interest, even though I am a huge Star Wars fan since my childhood.

The theme alone is enough to more than sustain my interest. Over any other source material (LOTR, Hunger Games, Firefly, Star Trek etc) I feel like this is the one that succeeds the most when introducing "nobody" characters as the heroes of the game. Imperial Assault does this with aplomb, with six well-rounded characters that fit classic roles (the leader, the veteran, the smuggler, the sharpshooter, the brawn and the religious/exile). Crafting backstories for them isn't essential, but is very fun in terms of deciding who will do what in the cooperative fashion of the game; "Would my character do this?". The models aren't perfect (some horrible mold lines- Imperial Officers' faces, I'm looking at you..r faces), but for games at a similar price tag, they are well above average. Who doesn't want an AT-ST to assemble and paint?

Not that paint is necessary either- the models look just as good in their natural grey and tan plastic. Personally, I have loved getting stuck into painting the figures and, unlike other miniatures I own, I have started with the rank-and-file rather than the heroes. And I have LOVED it. Star Wars costumes, particularly for Imperials, help to make this a painless and yet as challenging as you want experience.

In terms of gameplay... well, I admit to being a hater of too many rulebooks (hence why this is not a 10). This has just one too many. Granted, this is for different styles of play, but it put me off immediately. Lo-and-behold, there is an app! Much like Mansions of Madness (and there are more than a few similarities, thankfully, to ease me in) the app does all the thinking for you in running the game. Not only that, but the missions appear to be different than the ones found in the campaign book in the box; can anyone say bargain? Perhaps I will find the rulebooks amiable when I can pluck up the courage, but at least for the moment there is an excellent index section for as and when situations arise that need clarification.

The thrill of Darth Vader or IG-88 turning up in the middle of a mission cannot be downplayed and creates utterly gripping moments as two Rebel soldiers bit the force-dust allowing Gaarkhan to flee to safety. It's sequences like these, from different villains, that give this game a real sense of drama and epic scope despite its relatively small skirmish-size structure.

Amazing game. Fully recommended.

RATING: 3
Spent time playing skirmish competitively for multiple months, just never had fun playing the game, regardless of how much the concept seemed good in theory. It seemed hard to actually build a list that was both fun and interesting. Then I played the campaign for the first time yesterday and had a miserable experience. The game is completely unbalanced. Random rolls with little in the way of modification is all that tips the game between a completely easy time and an impossible challenge. The campaign is fundamentally unbalanced, and requires the Empire purposefully playing at less than their best for the rebels to stand a chance. In addition, small and semi-random rules are everything in this game, and you will spend more time looking up rules than playing the game. Stay away, play X-Wing instead if you're looking for a Star Wars miniatures game.

Campaign games do nothing for me.  Greatly prefer individual scenarios as it's much easier to get to the table.  With that said, I've still had fun with the campaign in this game.  It's probably a little easier to get a Star Wars campaign going with others than it is a random generic theme.      

Skirmish is the highlight of the game for me.  I've always loved putting together team/squads (which is why Heroscape is my #1 game).  There is a ton of variety in Imperial Assault, once you grab a few expansion packs - various skirmish maps, units, command cards, etc.  Would love more 4 player skirmish maps and objectives that are different than earning 40 VP to win.  

A coop app will make this a hard game to top.

Played one campaign - 4P 3 rebels characters.  Clearly, a big step up from Descent 2nd, which I view as weak all around. Many small improvements in the system made me mostly enjoy our first campaign.  Still suffers from normal descent issues - unbalanced missions/scenarios. And, it is a huge dice chucker with plenty of luck - which to some is a benefit.  I've gotten a little old for buckets of dice, I am sure I would have enjoyed this more 20 or 30 years ago.

April 2015 - un-fun.  Totally don't care what happens to my characters.  All the characters I've played have been totally ineffective. Little Stormtroopers are better. Decisions don't matter. My only hope is the skirmish mode at this point.

Favorite dungeon crawl with a DM. Two games in one and excellent production values.

Pros:
-Production value
-Star Wars Theme
-Quality miniatures (unpainted)
-Re-playable campaign
-Character progression
-1 Hr play time
-Skirmish mode

Cons:
-Set up time (30 mins)
-Campaign commitment

RATING: 8
Imperial Assault is the dungeon crawler I've been looking for.. except it doesn't have dungeons.
IA fixes the biggest issue of Descent; the boring Overlord (Imperial Player in IA) gameplay by alternating the turns between the Imperial player and rebel players. The second biggest change is the story driven structure of the campaign which makes the game enjoyable whether you lose or win the individual scenarios.
Some players fear the possible balance breaking snowball effect if one side wins multiple scenarios in a row as the winner usually gets reward bonuses. While I've yet to face this issue, I can imagine it happening in some rare cases. Nevertheless the game is highly enjoyable and in our plays the winner has always been resolved with the last die roll, so I definitely feel the game is as balanced as possible with all the options it offers.

First time player and went with the Empire. I did manage to squeak out a few victories and was very happy with the experience. Most of the missions came down to a single dice roll to decide who won, which I fell short on in several. Took us more than 6 months to finish, but I would like to try Bespin Gambit or Twin Shadows campaigns

The Descent engine finally comes into its own as a cracking tactical combat game. The overlay of Star Wars theme, a campaign game and a skirmish game offers tons of replay value. There are, however, better tactical combat games around.

RATING: 5
After having played a full campaign of this, I can definitively say this is not for me. As the Rebel player I found the endless surprises beyond irritating. While it's supposed to be cool and thematic for the mission to suddenly change halfway through, in practice it amounted to 'Guess what? You lose the mission because we're now redefining in it a way you couldn't have possibly known and the strategy you'd been taking turns out to have been entirely wrong for this mission. Cool, huh?'

No, it's not cool.

RATING: 9.5
Best heavy game of 2014.
It's almost too good to be true, Descent 2ed. has been streamlined even further and the generic nerd fantasy theme replaced with a one that pretty much everyone is familiar with - Star Wars. The ultimate dungeon crawler experience. As long as they keep expansions coming this will be the only one you'll need. Descent system of overlord vs. others is great and fixes all "AI" problems other dungeon crawlers have, of course you need a dedicated overlord who isn't just centered on winning alone but wants to create an immersive and fun experience for the group. But yeah it's awesome game. FFG has really stepped up their rulebook game recently with Eldritch Horror and this, and after ~20 minutes of dedicated reading (by overlord) and a quick tutorial mission you'll be all set for campaign. You can also play miniature skirmish matches with same set, good value.

2-Player Comment:
*After some 2p campaign games I would say it's my favored player count in many cases. Other player as emperor or with RedJaks automated co-op variant. The scaling system is very elegant and there's very little downtime with only two. Add skirmish and you have a very solid package for two.

J'ai jouÃ© la compagne Ã  4 joueurs (3vs1). DÃ©sÃ©quilibre total (mauvais groupe de perso ?), souvent au bout de 3 tours de jeu on s'avait qu'on allait perdre. Les scÃ©narios de la campagne reposent trop sur de l'attaque/dÃ©fense (un groupe doit atteindre un objectif, l'autre doit simplement l'en empÃªcher). Donc malgrÃ© un systÃ¨me de jeu affinÃ© par rapport Ã  Descent v2, la sauce a moins prise. Et bizarrement je trouve que thÃ©matiquement Ã§a cloche un peu.

Good: 
A Star Wars boardgame!

Good quality components. 

Bad: 
The problem I have with this one is the gameplay objectives (for at least the early scenarios) doesn't feel like Star Wars. 

The early objectives are pretty basic, as a rebel you just need to rush to the objective and interact with it within x turns. So, as the rebels, you just charge through the empire units to the objective and if you manage to get through the foes in time you win.  

I am hoping the app coming out later will elevate the gameplay to match Decent or Mansions of Madness.

While most would describe this as a re-skin of Descent (and I'm not going to disagree with that) it most certainly does not make this less of a great game. On the contrary it takes everything Descent does right and gives it an amazing lick of Star Wars paint. While the skirmish game is fun the campaign mode is where this really shines, letting you feel like part of the epic universe it is based and providing some seriously cinematic moments and hours of entertainment. And of course like all recent Fantasy Flight products the components and miniatures are fantastic.

I like the flow and pacing so far. I worry that the game may slow down too much as the missions get bigger and more complex but I'm really interested in seeing how much replayability there is in the campaign.

Update - solid game system but it really lacks that special spark. Too much is left too the dice and choices are very limited by the crazy turn limits.

RATING: 9
Oh, I am not an Ameritrash gamer and because of that I was really concerned, when I get this game as a present. However, we managed to try this out as 2 player game, and it was a blast. At first two days we went crazy and get through some 7 campaign missions. And it was really good.

Pluses:

+ Story and differentiation of missions is huge
+ Missions feels well balanced and they were close for us
+ Really clever space usage and map design.
+ Beautiful game
+ Game does not stop with just campaign, it includes skirmish options.
+ Campaign is designed with several differentation options, and because of that each time will be other missions.
+ Good tracking sheet
+ Amazing rulebook (actually 4 books)

- It is hard to jump in with different groups of people.
- Several characters are tokens in order for FF make miniature buisiness.

Verdict:
Amazing game!

The rulebook needs tightened up with some errata. It isn't nearly as polished as I would like. The movement rules are pretty gamey as well. The tactics aren't very interesting and even with the changing campaign objectives, the scenarios all feel somewhat similar races against the clock. The scenarios aren't individually well balanced for two heroes but over the course of the campaign it may balance out. Seems best with 4 heroes. Even the hidden elements don't seem like they make a huge difference in replayability.

Looks like a great game but again comes with the now usual splurge of expansions that FFG hopes to sell. I guess they would go all-out miniatures business if they expected people to keep up buying.

It was nice to have the opportunity to joint two missions in a campaign. Would like to play again. Still zero interest in owning myself.

Got for Xmas 2014, finally played the first scenario for the first time in May '15. I'm liking it so far. Early 2016: picked up several ally/villain packs and have enjoyed playing skirmishes at the local store. Also halfway through a campaign with the Descent crew. Good stuff!

Update late 2016: Campaign with Descent crew stalled out and fell flat. Campaign with another group is slowly grinding forward despite no one enjoying it much. Sadly if it wasn't for skirmish and the fact that I've painted most of the minis I'd probably look to unload it.

Despite what others would say, the game is not balanced if you have less than a full party of rebels. In additiom, the game is not balanced if the wrong rebel mix is selected. And, to make it all worse, once someone is ahead there is a severe run-away leader problem. These are minor concerns if you want to play occasionally. But it's very easy to end up in a situation where one side is dominating and you've committed yourself to a long campaign.

High quality beautiful components. But the very high setup-timings between scenarios and the bad game mechanics kills the fun for me. Specifically if u play the Szenario with only 2 Players, the best and most efficient way for the rebels to win is to rush through the map and ignore every fight. Here and there some lucky dice rolls on Computer Terminals and thats it. BORING!

What can I say?  I was a fan of Descent 2nd Edition and this game is a further refinement of that system, with the added bonus of having a Star Wars theme on top.  The mechanics are more polished than in previous iterations of the system, adding the ability to dodge and cancel surges while improving line-of-sight rules (oddly, the new system was one that I had house ruled for D:2E when it came out), while also incorporating story-like elements seen in games like Mansions of Madness.

Frankly, this game is a real winner, and if you don't detest rolling dice you owe it to yourself to give this one a look.

Would rate this game higher, but feel that it is an FFG money trap.  The base game does not even include Han Solo, Chewbacca, Yoda, R2D2, C3PO, Leia, etc. etc.  You have to buy these character packs for $10 each.  To me that is like opening a box of Lucky Charms with no Marshmallows, and the instructions saying you can purchase the marshmallows here...

If this game's expansions came out like Descent 1st Edition, than this would be a lot more tempting for me to buy, and also would rate the game higher, maybe an 8 or 8.5.  Plus FFG has been decreasing with each base set the variety.  For instance, in the base games Descent 1st Edition came with 20 Heroes, Descent 2nd Edition had 8 Heroes, and now SW:IA has only 6 Heroes.

The game play is very much a rush to complete these objectives and the heroes win type of game.  With all of the setup required for SW:IA, I would rather play Descent 1st Ed, for a deeper more in-depth dungeon crawl with more loot, monsters and heroes to choose from, or Tannhauser for a faster setup and easier to teach tactile miniatures game.  

With that said, it was fun for a group of old men to go "Pew! Pew!"

Ordered at Book Depository for AUD$95. 

Should be here soon.

UPDATE:

It's here now, and it's huge!

FURTHER UPDATE:

I saw this one sale as a âhotnessâ sort of item at Cancon for AUD$170 and while I am a Star Wars fan going back to seeing the original movie at Hoyts in George Street Sydney in 1977 I just could not justify that sort of price tag. Fortunately, my good friends at the Book Depository made sure that I didnât have to as a month or so later they had the base set on sale for AUD$90 odd with free postage. Very hard to say no at that price so I didnât.

Anyway, much as you would expect with a Fantasy Flight Games product, it is very well produced and the plastic miniatures are very very nice and true to the Star Wars characters they represent. I have been thinking about painting some plastic gaming miniatures (as opposed to myâ lead mountainâ of unpainted metal figures for miniatures gaming) and these guys have bumped the Zombicide chaps from the head of the queue.

I took the game along to a local board game meet up (GLOG at Gungahlin Library) in the expectation that a chum who knew the game would be there to teach it to me; alas he wasnât. I was a bit surprised when Little Fish the Elder (aged four) insisted we play this game, despite me only having given the rules a cursory glance (most of my rules reading time had been devoted to Cthulhu Wars). Anyway, Star Wars: Imperial Assault it was so I set up the introductory scenario and was joined by a few other others (one of when was an experienced player in the âdungeon crawlâ whose name escapes me that this is shares similarities with) so it wasnât too much of a learning curve.

Star Wars: Imperial Assault plays pretty well and isnât too hard to pick up. The challenge will be to get the most from oneâs troops as they acquire experience cards and suchlike; that knowledge will come with time and experience. One thing I really do like with Star Wars: Imperial Assault is that it has rules for both one-off skirmish games as well as campaign games. From what I can see, playing out a full campaign will be a very satisfying gaming experience.

So, after one play I am pretty much hooked. I can see me trying to get this to the table again and again as well as purchasing all the expansions and miniatures packs because:

1 Star Wars
2 Completist
3 Itâs actually rather fun.

Any Star wars fan who likes skirmish level gaming should really consider trying this game.

RATING: 3
Imperial Assault is a pretty awful and vastly over hyped re-skin of [i]Descent 2nd Edition[/i]. Sure its chromed to hell with a big grey AT-ST miniature in the box, but in terms of substance its just as awkward and shallow as D2nd. Being Star Wars themed doesn't make it any better!

Just as in D2nd they've killed all the decision making, fun and depth in the process of making a 'faster, scenario driven' game. The timed nature of many scenarios forces both sides hands tactically. You have to play cheesy tactics like blocking and stalling to win, or in the case of Rebels running away so the enemies can't touch you, both of which are frustrating to do and frustrating to have done to you. This rubbish makes every game feel like a soul destroying optimization puzzle, not a entertaining semi-coop game.

Most scenarios are totally unbalanced in favour of one side or the other.

Heroes also overdevelop into obnoxiously over complex piles of skill spaghetti ('Oh I rolled 2 hits and a surge, I'm going to use this skill to add a surge and gain focus, which in turn allows me to use my chazwaser ability to add Pierce 3 and move three spaces, I've then got within three range of a different target so I'm going to shoot them too using a special shot where I can deal damage equal to range but only if I'm stood next to another Hero in which case you can't see me to shoot me back and I deal you 9 damage pierce 3 with bleed, cleave 1 and stun'). Often Imperial player's units are essentially dead in one hit unless they get lucky and roll an evade!

As the Imperial/Overlord you're also significantly nerfed, with no real customization options. You have no event/keeper deck to build, no threat management (spawning points don't count), leaving you with few effective choices. After a point there is also little to spend experience on, as only a handful of cards will have a use depending upon your opponents. Influence cards are so hard to buy and their effects so circumstantial and weak they are hardly worth a glance a lot of the time.

All in all I just hate this game. It makes me feel miserable, bored and unhappy, regardless of which side I play on. Its as fun as throwing yourself off a building so that you land testicles first on a railing.

The 3 is totally justified.

I own this and several expansions. Having both an RPG and Wargame background, I find this game plays best as the Campaign (RPG lite) game. The skirmish, though interesting, is not an effective system compared to the older SWM - designed for skirmish. I rate this game very high for the Campaign - and it is now the only way we play it. It is also good for children who are 10 or older, or even 8 or older with some "assistance". The coop nature is best done when the Imperial Player views themself as "GM Lite", as opposed to an opponent. This creates the best atmosphere and real RPG style tension.

Overall, excellent game system for RPG Lite concepts. Good way to bring board gamers into the wider RPG fold. Very good for campaign systems.

This is Descent 2.0 with a Star Wars makeover. Most of the mechanics are exactly the same and some even have the same names (e.g. surges). Having played Descent it would have been less confusing if they hadn't bothered trying to rename the mechanics at all to avoid any confusion when switching between the two games.

Where the dungeon delving theme fits perfectly with the tile exploration and monster fighting in Descent, the Star Wars theme is limited to skirmish style encounters and apart from the highly detailed miniatures does not bring the Star Wars universe to life. So people looking for a deep Star Wars theme maybe disappointed with this dungeon crawl experience.

As I love dungeon crawls I think this is a fantastic game but as I prefer the D&D style setting my rating is lower than my Descent rating.

Descent was awesome fun and the long play time didn't bother our group. 

That said, FFG have finally nailed the formula with Imperial Assault. The Campaign Play is awesome, the rules refinements are spot on and the experience of each play is tense and well balanced. 

Add to that an entirely additional way to play, the Skirmish Game - read this as 1 v 1 tactical miniatures game, and Imperial Assault is worth every cent of the investment if you are into tactical miniatures types of games. 

Just be prepared to spend a lot of money because if you love it you will want every expansion and wave of minis. 

Descent was the HeroQuest of my middle years and Imperial Assault will be the game that I remember well into my greying years.

RATING: 8
It kind of out-Descents Descent in some tactical aspects, even though the feel is different enough for me to still love Descent, too. I play the campaign exclusively.

The SW theme seems to work great for this one & the combat is a bit more balanced and tactical than in Descent. 

That being said, in some missions (well, with repeated plays feels that maybe in most? my rating is kind of dropping with every play) the Empire can simply flood the game with endless troops, dropping them basically wherever he wants, which goes well with the theme and makes the scenarios "evenish", but at the same time kills the feel of the overall balance and achievement of the game. For me, this kind of difficulty feels artificially maintained, and has a a deus ex machina feel, which I don't care for that much.

-Campaign play where you level up
-Bosses

[b]Dislike:[/b]
-Imbalance that's hard to balance yourself
-Lots of small details in the rules
-Making lots of decisions that are most of the time unimportant (e.g. where to deploy and end your movement)

Okay, so I've played this game A LOT! Every campaign (until and including Hearth of the Empire) have I played at least twice, so you can count how many hours that about is. However, I wouldn't have played this game that much if it wasn't for the people who wanted to play this more than I do. I for one, don't like it that much anymore.

Here is the thing: initially it's pretty cool when you're discovering all the things and systems about this game. You set standards to stuff. So the first time as the Imperial player you deploy an AT-ST or Darth Vader you feel mighty when you suddenly roll 2 defence dice instead of 1, and the Rebels will look in fear and be like "What?! Two defence dice?!". The first time the Rebels destroy one of these they'll feel amazing. Then, the first time they ONE-SHOT (or one activation) one of these they'll feel invincible. The Imperial player will feel almighty again once he deploys his first boss with advanced stats. And once the rebels are able to defeat that, your standards are set in stone, and every game after you'll know what's a threat and what not.

So when nothing is surprising anymore, what kind of game are we left with? The Rebels can try different heroes and new combos, the Imperial player however... will keep doing what he always has been doing? He doesn't really have excess to combos so his role is basically the same as always: choose the most powerful units and cards (the Villain deck in Jabba's Realm might be the only exception). So yes, Imperial player will get boring faster than the Rebels, but that's okay: players can switch or you can use the app.

So what game are we THEN left with? I'll admit, even after my dozens of plays, I still like building my unique heroes and wondering what items will appear in the shop. Playing though, the part that takes the most of your time will become pretty meh. You'll just be doing whatever looks best, with no real interesting decisions. The dice just become an annoying time sink and numbers become meaningless. 90% you know that if you attack that guy twice he will be dead, but you still have to roll to make sure he doesn't get lucky. Dice should be about mitigating risk, but most of your rolls won't be about that anymore, just a resolution.

But wait: dice are also about having random events happen and adapting to them. True, you could see it as an interesting shifting puzzle: what should you do if the guy you intended to kill survives? But I don't want to roll and re-roll and cross-reference, all just to check if the guy survives! As you might've suspected already, skirmish is definitely not a game mode I like.

Okay, I might be rambling a bit, but here is the main thing: The problem is not so much that there are no more decisions to be made, but that the decisions you have to make have such a small difference. Whether you should kill this guy first or this, whether you should end your character's movement/deploy there or the space next to it; it all won't matter 90% of the time, but you still have to decide what it is exactly what you want to do. I find it hard to get my point across but I hope this last bit did.

TLDR; your first 1 or 2 campaigns will be awesome! But if you expect the game to be as new every time you play a new campaign, think again. It will just be more of the same, just with different numbers.

A MUCH improved version of Descent. I'm not that big of a Star Wars fan, but this is what I wanted Descent to be. Everything is so streamlined and quick, and the theme is overflowing from this game. The one glaring flaw here is that the game has an odd balance. It seems like the Rebels rack up wins pretty quickly, and then at the end of the campaign they lose. I feel like this should have been reversed to feel more thematic, but it does make for an exciting conclusion to each campaign. The skirmish mode is pretty fun, but also feels inferior to games like Battlelore.

UPDATE: Eventually degenerated into yet another game of comparing attack dice to defense dice. Great theme and components, but not much to return to after awhile. I prefer the simplicity of something like Zombicide at this point.

Great game regarding rules and components, but...
Campaign Game: The secrecy regarding mission information vs. heroes is ridiculous. Absolutely game changing if you ever played before (and thus know) the mission details, i have never encountered such effects with Descent.

***** Update *****
Campaign Game: The "surprises" for the rebels are a laughing stock. More important then intelligent play is the correct bet how the mission might be designed. Will switch to overlord role as i'm no longer willing to waste my time with playing heroes and the gaming group wants to continue playing IA.

Darn.  I so wanted this to be awesome.  I played with my fair share of Hasbro Star Wars figurines as a child and this seemed like a great opportunity to pass it on to my kids with more structured rules.  The figs in this game are great!  The boards are great!  I love how you can create scenes from within the Death Star or all the way to Endor.  But the game play is dry.  Your star wars character gets to do two things, which really boils down to moving and shooting or shooting twice.  Tactical nuance attempts to come from different dice based upon the weapon you use and the defense of the target.  But at the end of the day there are just not any real choices to be made.  This game made me realize that I am not a dudes in the hallway gamer, but even with that deficit, this game is not as good as Myth, and is in a galaxy far far away from Mage Knight, which is both an excellent dudes in hallways game and just an amazing game in its own right.

Wow is this game good. If you're a Star Wars geek, there's no reason why you shouldn't buy this game. The story is immersive and I love all the different twists and turns a session can take. I have only played as the Imperials (and, unfortunately, have not won as often as I'd like), so my experience is entirely from being the GM. The miniatures are great and the modular maps are really cool. The biggest downside is setup--it takes forever. If you're the GM, definitely set this game up ahead of time; even then, however, when you move on to additional missions and side missions, the modular map system slows you down a lot. The good news is that Fantasy Flight is releasing an app, which hopefully will cut down on setup time.

Hi!

So me and my group just finished the campaign of the base game, with me as the Imperial player. We started out with 4 players and midway through we were 3 until the end.

We did the following missions:
Aftermath - Rebel win
Loose Cannon - Imperial win
A new Threat - Imperial win
Sorry about the mess - Imperial win
Fly Solo - Rebel win
Means of production  - Imperial win
Viper's Den - Rebel win
Homecoming - Imperial win
Captured - Rebel win
Drawn In - Imperial win
A Simple Task - Imperial win
The Source  - Imperial win
Desperate Hour - Rebel win

Rebels - 5 wins
Imperial - 8 wins

Rebels won the campaign

Throughout the campaign the missions felt biased towards the Imperial player having the upper hand.
Most of the wins by the imperial player was a complete walkover and vice versa.
Three of the missions felt like they could have gone either way.

The players used the following characters:
Gidion Argus (left the game midway through the campaign and the rebels gained the heroic card)
Fenn Signis
Diala Passil
Mak Eshka'rey

*SPOILER*

And in the last mission they decided they had lost anyway and added Han Solo as their ally to the mission.
I added Darth Vader to my hand of deployment cards using the agenda card.
They took their time quietly eliminating forces and making sure I never had more than a few groups out.
It became easy to clear each room and by the end General Weiss had no where to hide and it was just a matter of math that he could not sustain.
1Â½ rounds before their time would run out they eliminated him and won the campaign.

In the end I felt that there was no point to this campaign and that the last mission we played, determining the campaign winner, was heavily biased towards the players.
I would have loved a mission which was touch and go and could have gone to either side, but this mission was a slaughter, where the only thing I could do was run and hide, trying to run out the clock.
All the cards I had gained and the power of my troopers amounted to nothing since the players could easily one-shot them, sometimes multiples, because if I was to make a dent on the players standing next to Solo, my troopers would have to be able to reroll.
Giving them a 4-action AT-ST didn't help matters much either. If they didn't have that thing, maybe the situation could have been a bit more even.

*/SPOILER*

Having tried my best to prepare for a win in the campaign, it fell flat for me, now that I've just lost the deciding mission. And going into it with a 8 - 4 score of wins I felt confident that I should have a good chance at least of pulling out a win.
I didn't want another mission of me crushing the players, but I definately didn't want this either.

I don't think that this mission and some of the others have been playtested enough by the designers and when this mission is the one deciding the end result of the campaign, it should be at least a challenge for both sides.

We've had some fun during this campaign, but most of the time the players have felt betrayed by the missions and lastly I felt betrayed by the last mission and the campaign win-condition.
This is why I'm giving this game a considerably lower rating, than I would have otherwise, which could have been helped by a more balanced campaign.

I will probably only play skirmish once or twice with this game, if that. So that part of the game has little to no value for me.
I only hope that we will be given a more open ended system like "Descent: Road to Legend", which was much more open ended and could endure several playthroughs without getting "old".
I don't see myself nor the players playing this campaign twice.


PS: The Gidion Argus-player left because he had to move to a different part of Denmark. Not because of unhappiness with the game :)

RATING: 5
Full disclosure: Not a SW fan. I mean, i like it I guess, but I have always seen the franchise as the lowest possible common denominator in terms of nerdery fandom. So IÂ´ve always been wary of "X thing but with Star Wars Theme slapped on OMG!BEstEVR!!!" Reactions.

Having said I love me a Dungeon Crawler/minis game anytime. So when a friend bought this we jumped at the chance to test it out.


Pros:
-Spectacular componentes: Classic FFG Bling here. The Walker mini alone is spectacular. The printing artefacts of FFG's usual cardboard stock however do rob the maps of some of its luster. Games like Level 7 or Claustrophobia look way more vibrant and detailed, but otherwise A+.

-Streamlined Play: Make no mistake, this is Descent 2.5. But there are minor enough changes that make it feel a bit simpler and more streamlined. The dice checks are faster and the turn sequence is altered to make it hero/overlord/hero/overlord instead of all players/Overlord. This does change the strategies in the game but I believe its for the better, and feels like it makes the overlord role more engaging (have only played as hero so far).

-Excellent Campaign play: Make no mistake, no other game in the market comes with a campaign book as comprehensive right out of the box. Branching paths, equipment & skill progression, sidequests, etc. Sure, you could argue that the "storyline" or whatever is barely there, but the SW flavour takes care of the fluff already and the allure is in the comprehensive scenario tree and options presented. A++.

CONS:

-Lackluster missions: Sooner or later it sinks in. The missions are all the same. Not in terms of objectives but on terms of flow. Basically the game exploits the idea that the overlord will always have some scenario-screwing twist locked behind an objective door or timed element. And its a one-trick pony. Once you've seen it it always boils down to "remember that when we open that door, a ton of baddies or some crap like that is going to appear". Bleh.

-Monotonous Gameplay: Overall the gameplay experience is cloned from Descent, which is not 100% to my liking. It can be fun and engaging due to its progression model, but IA's gameplay can basically be summed up as a "smash Â´n grab" race. Basically you have a very tight window of turns in which to complete your objectives and the overlord just keeps pumping monsters your way. Cool. Except the maps are small affairs (due to the time limits) that only serve to funnel characters into fights constantly. There's no defensive or conservative play here as in games like Level 7 or Space Hulk. Any turn you are not moving forward and kicking ass is a turn wasted. Which sounds awesome but gets monotonous reaaal fast. Remember how dynamics work kids: Something can only be perceived as "fast" if you alternate it next to something slower.

-Questionable Mechanics: You might consider these pet peeves, but if you are into miniature/skirmish games you would do well to remember that a)LoS rules are basically broken and b)movement is ridiculous.
Basically LoS is calculated from an attacker's corner to two target corners. But you can count valid corners as those within a wall and or in any configuration. Similar to D&D but without the concepts of partial cover, which results in basically everyone always having LoS against anyone.
Seriously.
I dare you to check this, but unless you are basically puting a whole building between your enemies there's practically zero chance you can take cover/hide from enemy fire.
Which leads me to the fact that there's no real way to block or hinder movement as any character can move across any diagonal even if flanked on all corners by walls and enemy units. Oh, and there's no facing except for some giant enemy units. 

Again this all falls in line with the idea of the game being a race and nothing getting in the way of you finding and shooting your opponents. But its cheesy as hell and robs the game of any tactical edge whatsoever.

-Maps are simple and small: Not to be redundant, but the largest maps we played so far are still smaller than Space Hulk's intro mission. Yes, at first glance SH's puny Suicide Mission is still larger than anything in this game :S. Again, this is because the game is a race and has no exploration or defensive play whatsoever, but stil...

Overall: If you are insanely in love w/Descent or SW then of course this just begs to be bought, and that's what FFG is counting on. However people need to understand that the game is merely engaging because of the campaign book and its progression system. And that's a one-trick pony. Besides that you have a mostly blunt game with zero room for subtlety or tactical nuances, which can still be fun, but puts it miles behind games that offer the same kind of gameplay with more elegant mechanics and variety of play and tactical options. No matter how you slice it Imperial Assault is a broken record that keeps blaring the same notes over and over. They may be fun notes for some, but better experiences are found elsewhere regardles of your undying loyalty to Disney's franchise.

Fun tactical miniatures game - nice mix of co-op and competitive (one person plays the Empire, the other players play rebels). The minis are really nice and the rules, while extensive, aren't too difficult to get into. The only thing I dislike is the line-of-sight rules, which are counterintuitive. The scenarios run a bit long for my family's taste, I think, and we petered out about halfway through the campaign, but I'm hoping to get this back to the table.

Streamlined miniatures war game, in one of the best universes available. Good game, well thought scenarios, characters, abilities and items. It is a whole afternoon of rolling dice which is definitely not for me, I won't play more or buy. Miniatures are fantastic. Expensive game to get into, but the miniatures don't require painting and minimal to no assembly which is great! Much more economically and timeframe feasible compared to Warhammer/ Games Workshop etc. Can get some bargains from the Book Depository.

Played a lot of the campaign with my roommates. The gameplay was solid, and I can see what people mean by streamlined. They simplified a lot of things while maintaining a good bit of theme. I don't think all the scenarios are balanced, but I think its hard to do that overall. I felt like this was more balanced than DnD though, but I also felt like its purely a tactical skirmish game at times.

Overall solid. The troops movements, attacks, and other things are cookie cutter, but its a good cutter I suppose. Nothing exceptional though, and I personally don't like the SW's theme. I think downtime is a little high (since you have to count out spaces to enemies and postitions change turn by turn) and that it could still be better balanced, but its okay. I think setup is a pain though.

Oh, I also wonder how much replayability there is in the campaign. I don't think there's honestly much. I don't want to replay any more of the missions I've already played...so there's that as another negative.

Plays: 4+

Edit: issues after many plays: low replay, high downtime, star wars theme sucks, miniatures are good but many are just repeats and bland, story sucks, huge imbalance in some missions, etc will not play again if i can avoid it.

At least in dnd the dm can balance behind the screen and give more freedom and immersion. char progression is bland too and loooooonsetup is annoyingly tedious

RATING: 7.5
Die Regeln sind fÃ¼r FFG-VerhÃ¤ltnisse erstaunlich verstÃ¤ndlich. Die Spielmechaniken sind grundsolide gestaltet und die modularen Kartenteile bieten groÃe Vielfalt. Miniaturen und sonstiges ZubehÃ¶r Ã¼berzeugen auf ganzer Linie. Zwingend notwendig ist ein Imperialer Spieler, der auch mal suboptimal spielen kann - ansonsten leidet der SpielspaÃ der Rebellen erheblich. Also ein nicht ganz perfekter Crawler, aber ein wahnsinnig gut aufgemachtes Spiel mit Eventfaktor. Verkauft weil: AP-Gefahr steigt im Laufe der Kampagne. Kein GefÃ¼hl von fortlaufender Handlung.

First impressions after playing two missions from the mini-campaign of Twin Shadows. Awesome! It's the first time I play a semi-cooperative game, where you have an overlord. I like the narrative aspect of the campaign. It's very thematic and very well integrated in the gameplay. At this stage, I don't know if the game is well balanced between the rebels and the imperials but I don't care. As I play the imperials, it was a pleasure to see the heroes trying to complete their mission. In cooperative game, it's often me that "leads" the others because my regular player are not familiar with the rules. Now, as the imperials, I can't do this role. I can teach them the rules and let them think at the best strategies but without me :-) 
The components are perfect, especially the miniatures. It gives me the desire to paint them.
I'm really looking forward to play it next time!

It's as much Star Wars as it can be. In my short experience, it pends a little towards the dark side, but nothing that a DM mindset - which I consider fundamental for this kind of game - can't fix. A huge improvement over Descent.

The game is very fun and a pretty good alternative to a traditional pen and paper RPG like D&D. It's an asymmetrical game where one person plays the Empire and the rest play heroes of The Rebellion.  FFG could use an official companion app to go along with the game to save items and experience.  The box also leaves something to be desired and you almost require a custom box organizer of some kind.  I have the one from Broken Token that works quite nicely and solves the box issues.  It would also be nice if there was an option for the empire to be auto-run so smaller groups could play together against the Empire.

I've wanted to try an "RPG" just to say I've tried it. This is the closest I've come so far and it was just ok. I could see myself being willing to play it if someone else got everything and scheduled everything and I didn't have another regular weekly game event. So it is never going to happen.

This is a simple skirmish game that uses most of the Descent 2 rules. It has a 1vs1 confrontation mode game that seems pretty interesting, but we just played the first "mission". Of course, the "star" of this game must be the campaign. I like the player scale mechanisms.

I cannot say the game progresses slow, but it doesn't feel fast either, because you're not doing anything when it's not your turn.

The components are top notch. The miniatures are really cool and the rest of the stuff has high quality. Sadly, the price is even higher and just by having a look at the planned expansions, their cost and their meager components, it feels FFG is more interested in making money than in making a good game.

After being a RPG hardcore gamer during a lot of years, this kind of games doesn't fill me up. Yes, the decisions are there, they are meaningful, even if not deep, there is tactic, but RPG have soooo much more than that... Still, they have some entertaining value for me and I can play them.

Of course, I know that this game will be an instant hit for many ameristrash lovers. I wish I could enjoy it as much as they, because it's Star Wars we're talking about :D

This game addresses pretty much every nitpick that I had with Descent 2.0.  Smoother, slightly more streamlined, and a bit more balanced.  Throw the Star Wars theme on top and this is pretty much the perfect campaign based "dungeon crawl" game.  The skirmish mode is just the icing on the cake.

Need to explore this more really. The whole product seems gold standard TBH both in terms of what you get in the base box and the supplementary stuff (little side-quests with each blister pack). It also seems to run smoothly and be fairly intuitive. It is a bit intimidating though and may be more of a 'life-style mono-game' rather than What I was hoping for: Star-wars meets Heroquest for the dilettante DM.

It's a Star Wars themed dungeon crawl with RPG elements... how can you go wrong?  But if it's not enough info for you, the components are very good (especially the minis) and it seems to have a lot of potential as a campaign.  The only negative from 1 play seemed to be AP... there was a lot of "If you go there and do X then I use my special power on Chewie then the Jedi kills the Stormtrooper... wait that won't work.  What if we try..."  I hope that will go away with familiarity after more plays.

This is one of my favorite games ever played, even if it did not have the Star Wars theme. I feel that it's a much more polished version of Descent 2nd Edition and it fixed the things that I thought made no sense in Descent. Also, it's two different games in one box; two different and great games I might add.

To help those of you who are thinking about this game I included my comparisons between both, Star Wars: Imperial Assault (SW:IA) and Descent 2nd Edition:

* 2 Different and Great games in 1 box (Traditional Campaign & 2-Player Skirmish mode); Descent is only one game (Campaign)

* SW:IA has a better hero kill mechanic where the first time you deal full damage to a hero he is "wounded" (flip his card over and has weaker stats), if you deal full damage to a wounded hero then he is out for the remainder of the mission. I was not pleased with the Descent as a hero NEVER dies!!! When you âknock-outâ a hero in Descent, the hero simply loses a turn and comes back to full health, something I found very frustrating as the Overlord player

* In SW:IA the additional ally/villain packs add more to the game in the form of Skirmish & Story/Side Missions; not just an additional figure which you may not be able to use in a campaign like in Descent 

* SW:IA has extremely high replay value as there a countless number of story/agenda cards, and the number grows as you add expansions

* The mechanic of taking turns in SW:IA is much better and polished; activating one Rebel, then one Imperial, one Rebel and so forth, makes it feel like each player is involved in making actions every other turn. Unlike Descent where all Heroes perform their actions, then all monsters, all Heroes, all monsters, so forth.

* For players who are inexperienced to dungeon crawlers, SW:IA might be a little too intimadating and complicated for them at first. Descent is a tad bit simpler if you want to get newbies interested

* Both games contain a ton pieces to organize and setup, SW:IA has more

* Descent instructions are a little bit easier to read and understand the first time

A good game but not a whole lot above Descent 2.0 to be honest. Thematically it is very strong and the miniatures are better but the rules are a bit unclear and unnecessarily complicated. Once again from FF there are too many decks to manage - story mode, side missions etc. and they are a little difficult to get the hang of at the start. Looks like it will get going once I get further into the campaign though, so looking forward to that :)

Waited a long time to start playing again because I felt that an app would finally come. Glad to get this one to the table. Good for a bit of fun and the app works pretty well. It does get a bit samey after a while but still a keeper. campaign mode great too - i love the way your character starts to build up gear and skills pretty quickly.

Tentative ranking given I have read the rulebook. Love Star Wars and like the way it can be played two ways.

Update: 30/12/14 arrived today and played a solo skirmish match. I quite enjoyed it, perhaps more than I thought I would. Now for the campaign soon. Might even be interested in tournament play at a local games store.

Update: 7/6/15 I think the skirmish mode will most certainly hold this at its rating for me. I am glad FFG created it with two systems. The campaign mode is alright but nothing mind blowing.

Update: 10/10/15 Down to a 9. Still an excellent game. Just not representative of a 9.5 anymore.

The story telling aspect of this was fun and I liked the progression and variance in stories, but it felt like a tactical miniatures game more than anything else. Couple that with the high luck factor and that I'm not really a Star Wars person, this game did absolutely nothing for me. I honestly have no desire to play it again. Would much rather play Descent 2e over this and I found 2e average.

RATING: 9.5
Right now this game is completely blowing me away. It looks amazing, (the components {especially the map pieces} are top-notch!) it plays super-streamlined and fun, and the campaign is so fricking cool I want to pee. But I won't. 

Right now I am having an incredible time with this game. I cannot speak to balance at this time, but the Imperial player did kind of run away with the first campaign I played. I think that is because of the one flaw I can find with the gameplay: Rebel Allies cost too much Threat to deploy. They just aren't worth it. I mean, Rebels got Luke Skywalker on the first side mission, and then deployed him in the next few missions and lost every single one. First mission they did not deploy him, they won (unfortunately for them it was a forced mission and it didn't get them anything). In theory, he has to kill 10 Threat worth of Imperial units to make him worthwhile. It's just not going to happen. ]

Other than the Rebel Allies foible, I feel that this game is the perfect adaptation of the good team vs. bad guy game. I think Middle-Earth Quest is a better one-off game, but the campaign mode is just so well put together and slick that overall this game is better. Time will tell if this remains true, but as for right now, I am foaming at the mouth to buy all of the add-ons for this, as soon as they come out. Looks like you've got another money maker, FF.

Thank you, based Conieczka.

Ahhh, Descentâ¦in spaaaaaace. I was on the fence with this one, but my family picked it up for me as a Christmas gift. The developers did a great job refining the Descent 2.0 system. The alternating activations between the Rebels and the Imperial player makes for much less downtime for the Overlord. Like its predecessor, the campaign system really elevates IA above a simple tactical minis game and provides story, character growth, and gradually-introduced complexity.

What was initially a fun and exciting Star Wars themed miniature game quickly grew stale for my group.  After playing through 3 campaigns, this one is going back into the box until the co-op app comes out.  

The reason for this is in the balance of the missions.  As a player, there are few clues in the mission to tell the players whether this is a "race to the finish" or a "hunker down and methodically kill your way to the finish" mission.  If you guess incorrectly, you will lose.  In "race to the finish" missions, you need to sprint to the objective as quickly as possible, often ignoring enemies.  In "hunker down and methodically kill your way to the finish" scenarios, you need to take it slowly and kill every enemy you see in order to survive.  You can see how guessing incorrectly will lose you the game.

Also, the players equipment is entirely luck of the draw, and it's easy for the Imperial player to grow more powerful than the group.  In none of our games has the Imperial player lost.  Since they know exactly what the mission entails and what the objectives are, they can easily tailor their choices accordingly.  This is not to suggest that it's impossible for the Rebel player to win, but it's extremely difficult.  I hope the app changes that.

RATING: 7
Gameplay is better than, say, Space Hulk. 

However, the scenario system is a mess (e.g. really prompts you to play with the same players, or at least the same Empire player). And the random scenario generator is awkward to use.

Also, the way they've handled expansions is along a 'price gouging' model.

This is possibly my first game I rated a 10. I love tactical games and this one has plenty of it. I guess it roots back to my final fantasy tactics days on the PS1. Put a Star Wars spin on it and you've got me hooked. This looks and plays exactly (more or less) like Decent. The hard part is getting a group of players together to play this regularly due to conflicts in each other's schedule.

It's a medium-weight dungeon crawl.  

Is it a bad game? No. 
Does it have anything to do with Star Wars? No.  

This is one of the most pernicious examples of a pasted-on theme that I've ever seen. Probe droids wandering around in a cargo ship?  Imperial Guard hanging around a security installation?  Everything is just so shoe-horned in to make use of the Descent 2 mechanics.  

You want to do a Star Wars game?  Give me wide-open spaces and deep hallways, hangars and chasms and long-distance fire-fights. This is just appropriating a theme to sell an interesting, but unrelated product.

WARNING: Game play is BORING!!

This game had great potential, and of course the theme is amazing (who doesn't like Star Wars??)- but after a few games it really gets OLD and repetitive...

Taking 2 hours just to shoot a few Stormtroopers is not fun... its just slow.  What really takes place in a couple of minutes of real time takes way too long in game play.  

Perhaps does something that is mindblowing - it makes a Star Wars themed game... BORING!  

Calculating just that one extra blaster shot just isn't fun. 

By the way, if you like the system, I would say that Descent is better.

IA is a mechanically sound, highly enjoyable tactical game. It is based on Descent, which I believe it improves upon in all aspects. Although strategy is certainly involved, the random dice rolls and variety of effective options prevents you from thinking too hard about the next "perfect move." Instead, you jump in, try your best, and hope your buddies bail you out if you messed up. :-) Great fun! Highly recommend playing the Star Wars soundtrack in the background while playing.

I've never played Descent so I can't comment on the similarities or contrasts there.  I really like the combat mechanics in this game.  I find them very fast and easy to process.  I also like the good guy/bad guy/good guy/... turn sequence.  I wish the campaign for the base box wasn't so long.  I like that there are side quests/missions interspersed with the main missions, but at the same time, the main missions really feel like they take a lot longer than the side missions so it screws up the pacing of sessions in a way.

My one big complaint about this game is I got some of the figure packs for the game, but once your campaign is going there's really not much of a way to integrate those things into your game unless they happen to be mercenaries or regular enemies.  

I really like this one though.  Theme is fantastic, characters are awesome, tons of missions in the core box.

RATING: 8
The Star Wars theme is fine, but I honestly like the Descent Fantasy theme more. Regardless, the minis are nice, the levels are well designed, the changes to the rules drastically improve the game system over it's mechanical predecessor, Descent 2nd edition. The huge improvements include having players take turns between monster activations, moving the miss result onto the defense die that the lighter armored characters roll, as opposed to having it on the attack die, and in general, the theme fits the timed-style maps much better than a Dungeon Crawl setting does.  That being said, my playgroup took issue with the timed missions aspect of things. For them, this game needed to be more of a monster-masher for them to enjoy it. Pity.

Do you like DnD but hate all the complicated character design, and complicated gameplay, and role-playing? Well then this game will simplify the combat (not in a bad way), and make things move quickly. But otherwise... It's just DnD simplified in a way that doesn't really make it any more vibrant.

Oh, and it's Stah Wahs, so if you love that you can probably enjoy this. But I don't, so I don't very much.

BUT BUT BUT: I play(ed) it twice a month in campaign mode with people I like, so it's a nice change of pace from our other regular board gaming nights.

But, the built in timers in most missions turns it into a run and gun mess that I eventually found really tiresome.

Our campaign fell flat after a few sessions. 

I still really like this game right now, but I think we need the right group of people and maybe when the app comes out I'll play it again.

I also really like skirmish, but again nobody else is willing to get "into" it. To play this game you really need to be able to get "into" it. 

It also helps that I can paint minis and get enjoyment out of that.

UPDATE 10/23/17:  The app needs to come out. I really like Skirmish. I've played the game a bunch of times, but haven't played much lately. This is much more of a system or lifestyle game that you really need to invest in. I don't know anybody who is really willing to invest in these types of games. I personally love system or lifestyle games though so thats why i still rate this game so highly.

Just got this game as a xmas gift and have already played a few games.  I love the campaign part of the game, this truly is star wars in a box next to Star Wars Rebellion.  Going to be getting all the big box expansions for sure. So much replayablity with all the expansions and different paths you can take if the rebels win or the imperials win.  Also the new Legends of the alliance app just adds another great feature to the game where you can play coop or solo.

Hey all,
I just want to like these dungeon crawl games that are rpg lite.  But I just desire playing an rpg, instead.  One irritating thing is the need for balance i these games.  Also, your character should be able to die!  Sick of no death in these games.  Rated a 4 in January of 2015.

Hey,
Improved rating to 6 after a couple more scenarios.  We lost one of the scenarios which made me feel that the game is not so bad.  I wish death could mean more.  I so dislike that death is not permanent in games today!  February 2015.

Of the myriad of dungeon delving scenario games out there, (Doom, Descent, Conan, etc.) I think Imp Assault is one of the better.
The rules are polished so it's easy to just get going from scenario to scenario, and while I'm no Star Wars fan the theme is used here to great effect...

That said, Imperial Assault still suffers from the same issues that turn me off other games in this style.  It takes hours to finish a scenario, and you'll reflect back to realize not much at all actually happened.   The campaign story snippets would be better placed in children's cartoons, and every decision is followed by lots of rolling dice negating any semblance of meaningful player input.

REALLY good. VERY story driven as far as the campaign goes. I love the narrative and the ability for the Rebels to do side missions. Every time I have played this with friends we always have a blast. Last side mission we played was neck and neck and came down to the last turn.

I think they have taken the Descent style system and really improved on some things for this. Also the fact they included rules for a skirmish style game is just a HUGE bonus. Im looking forward to finishing out the campaign and seeing how my rating holds up.

Overall a big box of thematic fun with tons of choices to be made throughout.

I bought this on a whim when it was on sale after hearing it was pretty good. It quickly became one of my favorite games, if not my absolute favorite game. The asymmetrical, mostly-cooperative gameplay is cool, and it feels like a very light role-playing game, focused mostly on combat with some light storytelling. It being set in the Star Wars universe only makes it that much cooler, in my opinion. Setup takes a decent amount of time and it was a little hard for some of my friends to get it at first, but once you get into it, the rules aren't that complicated.

RATING: 6
While this game has some interesting ideas, it suffers from a couple of flaws, some serious.

The early-game of a campaign is heavily Imperial-sided, with the Rebel players having limited access to weapons and items. This, fortunately, becomes less of a problem in the later stages.

The most serious flaw is that the game was designed for multiple playthroughs, but not in the traditional sense: while it has limited scripted variations, the main concept is designed so that Rebel players are at a serious disadvantage the first time, as they don't know how turn limits and several other triggers affect their games, which in turn gives the Imperial player a great advantage, as they can plan ahead.

The aspect of cooperation between the Rebel players is, however, well executed: this makes it a still enjoyable experience when played with friends.

While not very complex, it is very challenging without 'explaining' things to the players or them having played before.  Many of the 'hidden' aspects to be figured out are on a clock that does not allow for cautious play.  Being forced to run and gun wounded or lose to time, time after time gets rough.  And you can win every fight but the last one in a campaign and have a crushing defeat.  MUCH easier/better after a first play through.

Poured the most $$ into IA, but I'd still consider my best boardgame investment: I've literally lost track of the # of games I've played. As of mid-2017 I probably played about 8~10 full campaign, 15~20 mini-campaign, and somewhere between 250~400 skirmish missions

full campaign = 11~14 missions
mini-campaign = 4 missions
every campaign & skirmish mission takes about 1~1.5hr

I can't decide if I like this more than Descent 2 or not. The new turn order, where there's more back-and-forth between good and evil, means less endless chat from the players as they try to decide their entire teams movement ... but in a way it also reduces the skill level in Imperial Assault, with planning reduced.

It succeeds in making small team combat tactical.

Overall, it's just move-attack, move-attack over and over again, with turns taking surprisingly long to resolve because of table chat. 

A pretty good game but none of it is rocket science. Unless you get into the 'spirit' of it, you might just feel there's not much game inside the huge box.

I loved this. I'm already sold on dungeon-crawlers, but the way this plays with the world of Star Wars really got me. My experience was improved so much by the fact that each hero on our team (we had three) got their own moment that, if it were a movie, would have been supported with a triumphant John Williams score -- I (the gunner) mowed down a whole hallway of Stormtroopers in one turn, the Jedi rushed an officer and took him out with Vibroknuckles, and the Bothan infiltrator made a suicide strafe to knock out the last security camera we needed to end the mission. I really want to do the campaign mode.

I feel kinda weird not giving this a higher score.

It has lots of things I like. Campaign based progression. Fantastic miniatures (that really just scream at me to paint). Team based play. Strategy required from the players. It's hugely thematic (it's Star Wars!!!!). Gameplay makes sense and is pretty easy to learn. It's a nice looking dungeon crawler. Seriously, all good here!

On the other hand, I currently don't understand how the rebels can win. Admittedly this is only from 2 short campaign missions. 

My issue is really with my final game - the Imperial player won one game by completely surrounding our last mission objective. Since we couldn't interact with it if there is an Imperial soldier within 4 spaces - we had to be able to kill every single one of them. The ability to do this kind of thing really bursts the thematic bubble. I can just imagine the conversations of the actual characters in game.

Stormtrooper - "Captain, the rebels are coming. Shall we move forward and take them down?"
Royal Guard - "No, they're coming for this terminal. Lets huddle around it and prepare Operation Human Shield"
ST - "Errrr, OK. Can I at least shoot at that guy?"
RG - "NOOOO! He's a Wookie. If you hit him, you'll only make him mad and he'll be able to hit harder."
ST - "What about that trooper over there? I'm sure I could hit him."
RG - "NOOOO! He's at full strain. If you hit him, you won't do much damage and he'll likely lose all his strain tokens. Just put your gun down and go huddle beside those Tusken Raiders"
ST - "......"

Perhaps it is partly to do with our tactics (though some of the guys had played this game a lot previously). I do appreciate that it is a successful tactic for the Imperial player to use and it isn't a case of being a sore loser. It just takes some of the mystique of the game away to see this kind of tactic be usable and successful.

I will be playing this again and I will certainly reconsider re-scoring this in the future. 

*Edit after 2nd night's play
Well, now been on the end of a Rebel victory. "Focus on the objectives" is certainly the call of the day. More than ever, I realise the game is not about shooting or killing anyone as a Rebel. It tends to always be about just sprinting like crazy to the objective markers. For the Imperial player, it is definitely about swarming and surrounding the objective token with as many bodies as he can fit there and going for victory by attrition. If the Imperial player could have opened the final door, he would have done so and just surrounded the final objective with as many people as he could and hoped to stall us until time ran out. 

So when there isn't really any other tactic for the Rebels except to sprint forward and ignore the people shooting at them, it really makes for very uninteresting decision making. In an entire game, which might last 2 hours+, you might have 2 or 3 actual decisions to make. The biggest decision will be what to spend your end money/XP on.

Also, when it isn't your turn - there's little reason to pay attention to what is going on. So long as the Imperial player wakes you up whenever he shoots your character - that basically sums up what you need to do. Unless you want to be the table captain, of course, and tell everyone else why their idea is wrong and what they should be doing. 

My review now changes to a 4. I'm going to finish the mini-campaign I'm in, then will require serious persuasion to ever bother playing again. Though could possibly change if I ever try Skirmish mode, that sounds like it might possibly be interesting.

My sister and I had a blast at first with this game. Until many scenes in when we realized that the double move a Rebel got when only playing 2 characters allowed him/her to run pass almost everything the Imperials put out. It was frustrating for me as I was playing the Imperials. I only won two games at the beginning. After that my sister just keep her characters running to meet the objective and I was lucky if Darth Vader could get one hit in before she had dashed into another room. 

This game I am sure plays much better with more players.

8.20.15 Have played the intro game a few time and now working through the campaing. Right now I am loving this game and giving a through 9.5 and we have not even started to skirmish yet. I like both the theme (star wars) and the rather short missions that can be done usually under two hours with setup and take down.
10.19.15 After getting into the campaign game and moving it along, I am going to bump this to a 10. It just hits the sweet spots for me in the these campaign type games.

RATING: 6.5
I've played the tutorial and the "Aftermath" mission in the campaign.  Within 1 minute of opening the box 2 of the probe minis were destroyed by my kids (warning for parents).

Pros 
- The persistence of the campaign mode seems to be the main draw for the game.  I will update my review when I experience a few more missions.
- Stellar components (other than the flimsy probes)
- Fantastic presentation
- Intuitive mechanisms for young kids to pick up (though this is countered by the amount of text in the game)
- Miniatures provide a more visceral experience.

Cons
- Setup is long. You have to build the map.  This involves sifting through a pile of tiles finding the correct ones and then assembling it.  As the imperial player you have to then read the campaign text.  You have to find the cards you need for your deployments, find and prepare various other decks and tiles.
- Cross-referencing 3 rulebooks - I'm sure this goes away with experience, but when you are new, you have a rules reference guide, a learn to play guide, and a campaign guide, all of which are interconnected and reference each other.  Example: "What does stun do?"... lets check the learn to play guide, it just says there are effects that are placed on characters.  Ok, let's check the  rules reference, it says check the effect cards... which deck is the effect deck?  Ok, let's look up what the effect deck looks like on the component list in the learn to play guide.  Sort through the massive pile of cards and find the effect deck, find the stun card, read it and place it on a character.  It's a lot of work to figure out what the stun effect does.

Anyhow, I'm excited to keep playing and seeing if the setup and referencing are less time consuming in future plays.

RATING: 7
Very nice game, great minis and mechanics. However, in my opinion, it would be ideal to play with the same people always to finish a campaign, which depends on your group of friends, and with enough frequency to not forget the the rules (I find some of them a bit overwhelming). I haven't tried the skirmish mode yet, so I can't give an opinion for it...

We loved this game after playing the first 2-3 games of a campaign, but our interest in the game declined with every subsequent play.  We made it through 12 full games, and by the end we were ready to be done.  Even though the scenarios are all different, it still felt pretty much the same every time we played.  We also found that the scenarios were not very well balanced, so one player usually just had no chance of winning.  In most cases, the empire just crushed the rebels, which was pretty disheartening.  We liked the dungeon crawler feel, but we would like it more if we were working together against the game rather than competing against each other.  Will trade away.

RATING: 10
06-01-2015. Rated after 8 plays. What is there more to say than this game basically is Descent 2 fixed, mating with Star Wars.

Yeah, it's mostly Descent 2. But it's line of sight system is better, the chance to miss moved to the defense die, there are now multiple defense dice (If I remember correctly I think there was just one before). For me, the biggest improvement is the open-endedness of the campaign system, which feels less scripted than Descent as the overlord has events, can spawn/repair units.

This game took everything I disliked about D2, and fixed it. It's a great story-driven game. One potential downside would be that overlord has become either less powerful, or more reliant on the story. Therefore, it seems less replayable.

I have only played this "Solo" with the companion app, Legends of the Alliance.  I don't own any video game consoles and this gives me that feeling of Star Wars Battlefront which was one of my favorite PS2 games.  It takes a bit to get the mechanics to run smoothly but after repeated plays it becomes second nature.  The tutorial in the app is a great supplement to the rule book and really helps to illustrate the mechanics that may otherwise be confusing.  I can only imagine it would be better with more players.

If you like Descent: JitD (2nd Ed.), it improves on that version with Star Wars theme.  We got through a fourth of the campaign but stopped due to a move.  I would like to p lay the 1v1 competitive rule set soon tho.

:thumbsup: A two-for-one of enjoyable games. The Campaign is a fun Star Wars game, and Skirmish is a true sandbox in which fans can play out the free for all fan fiction fights from their dreams.
:thumbsup: Nice miniatures, a pleasure for painters.
:thumbsup: A double rulebook system: Learn to Play + Rules Reference Guide. This wouldn't work well with many other games, but it does in this FFG title. It reminds me a bit of the videogame approach, where more gameplay abilities are unlocked as the game's storyline progresses. Here you start playing after reading through the Learn to Play booklet, and when you encounter a situation that isn't covered there you look it up in the Rules Reference Guide. The latter comes with a useful index, and a good cross reference system between related items. But as as a rulebook on itself, it's a mess. It's a bit of a nuisance to read it as is. And if you don't encounter the situations that prompt you to look up a rule in there, it's possible that you'll be playing without an essential (albeit often small) rule unwittingly...

----

:thumbsdown: So. Many. Expansions. It's a double-edged knife. Granted, you're not obliged to buy any expansions. You can use tokens and the stat cards are provided in the game (and campaign expansion boxes). But you'll want them, 'cause you're a Star Wars fan. But then you'll have the luxury problem of finding storage for all those miniatures (especially if you paint them), cards and tokens. And the choices: what card decks will a use in my campaign?
 Which figures? For Skirmish it's a lot of fun to be able to build a wide variety of teams, of course.
:thumbsdown: I find Campaign games to be a tad 'bittersweet'. Playing as a campaign adds an extra dimension to the gameplay of any game. Your sessions feel like part of a greater whole, your actions are steps towards something beyond the current scenario. But it adds more 'scheduling' to your free time. The schedules of a campaign group need to align, and that's not something that's easily doable for some people. I have started multiple campaigns, but haven't seen even one of them all the way through to the end... And story-wise, the patchwork of story missions and side missions often provides a narrative that doens't make all that much sense. Though I must add that each mission on its own reall does feel like Star Wars.

Imperial Assault is the best implementation yet of the "Descent" system, sanding away some of the rough edges that have always given me pause before. The gameplay is leaner and meaner than it was even in Descent 2e, and the Star Wars setting is well done enough, though not as natural a fit as something like X-Wing. The scenario design has so far been better in the story missions than in the side missions, though even in the low points I've enjoyed myself. I also question some of the balance with two heroes, who are given extra action and increased HP to help balance the game. It seems a bit strong, though it's also a distinct possibility that I'm just a lousy Imperial player.

Surprisingly enough, I don't get enough play with this excellent game.  We just haven't found the right group to get into the campaign, and I'm very disappointed in that.  I'm hoping as my boys get a few more years on them that this game will take front-stage as our group game.

We were four players and tried the first scenario twice. The feeling is compared to "Earth Reborn": you set up the mission, begin to play and the game ends within a few minutes. Somehow disillusioning. I hope it will develop better in future plays. We the Rebellion players were a bit frustrated. But I highly expect much more from the game.
The game components are absolutely gorgeous ... I haven't seen such fine miniatures before.

EDIT: We tried the first scenario and although we were again not successful the soul of the game began to shine and we got a better feeling about the whole thing. The idea of developing your hero is simply gorgeous.

This is a game that only true fans of Descent and other dungeon crawlers can appreciate. Anyone else, expecially real RPG players, will wonder why a game based almost 100% on combat got so scanty, confusing and flat rules. Cover and line of fire rules are amusingly messy and explained in great length and detail, but at the end of the day you can either shoot someone or not all, with no middle ground (shoot with penalties) as anyone would expect in the case of partial cover or limited vision. Similarly, movement rules covers almost any possible case (mostly regarding movement through angles and other miniatures), but at the end of the day, any miniature can always move through almost everything, albeit with a penalty. Concepts like interdiction, suppressing fire or area control are completely absent (strangely enough, however, heroes can heal themselves while shooting by getting special results on the dices), and almost any tactical decision is more based on the intrinsic mechanics of the game (mostly how many rounds are left before the failure of the mission) than on something that really resemble tactical movement in the middle of a shootout. 
In other words, this is a game that is incredibly simplified, made for players who likes to play a campaing and getting special powers for their characters while more or less stomping any opposition. Anyone else who may be interested in a mode realistic combat simulation, should look elsewhere.

I bought it recently and since then I played the tutorial mission and one skirmish game with my wife. So far it looks great. Models are very beautiful, I love them and I'm really looking forward to paint them.
One thing I don't like much are the command cards in skirmish. It looks like it will be really hard to create a deck. And when two people are playing with just one box there are not duplicates for some cards, so both players may choose same card for their deck.

Campaign game: Definitely better than Descent 2 - the adventures feel much more substantial, though they also have a weird truncated feel with how the scenario stops as soon as objectives are achieved, and it feels very game-y in those last turns in particular ("Oh if we just do this and this, we can ignore those guys attacking us from all sides, and should win easy"). Seems much easier for the rebels, but maybe it should be - at least does not have the no-brainer spawn the best monster and block strategy for the overlord. The miniatures are a delight; character development is fun. An impressive amount in the box. Don't like the Imperial Walkers owing to the change of scale, which is annoying.

Staaar Warsss... the theme to Star Wars!  Admittedly, I haven't played this game as much as I would want to, but it is only due to the fact my wife hates combat games (even though she plays Kemet just fine... go figure!).  Have played skirmishes 5-6 times, and I just love going up against the other teams, and the cat and mouse nature of the missions.  This rating is without even having touched the campaign mode!  This would probably be even higher in that case.  Can't WAIT for the APP to be available in 2017 so I can play single player!  Or maybe I can find a friend to play with before then...  Probably waiting for the APP... :)

Big, big Star Wars fan here, so this trade is with heavy heart. This game is just not me cup of tea. 

Too much of a hassle, too many parts/cards, too many badly designed rules. The game feels way to dependent on.. well, almost everything to make it work. 
I'm not a fan of games that need a lot of work from the players themselves to function or be balanced even a tiny bit.

Next to that is the mandatory need for a game-master, which will probably be the one who owns the game, and it's quickly turning into just a frustrating game night for me. It's just no fun!  

Adding to it the famous FFG business model; lots and lots of expansions to keep it fresh and playable. This game is off my shelves and to a better home to be played.

Game-play and choices make this a fun RPG.

However, it seems like the outcome of most scenarios is pre-determined. No matter how well you play it seems nearly impossible to win some, and others even if you did everything wrong its still a walk in the park. Maybe this is somewhat a function of the characters that are being played, but it seems to me that the game really needs better balancing.

It's like playing a role playing game, but just focus on the battle.  It's fun, and not overly complex while still allowing for some good strategy.  Still mostly a luck based game, but there's enough options in a turn to make it feel meaningful.

You shoot me, I shoot you. Only take into account all these mitigating and fiddly factors. OK - that's not a fair summary because really you need to play a campaign to experience the game. But taking turns to blast each other, no matter how immersive it might be, just doesn't interest me enough for the amount of time it takes to not just play, but set up and pack away too. Give me Quantum any day over this.

A completely wonderful one-vs-many game based on the Descent 2E engine. This game is so tightly designed and has so few "fiddly bits" for a ginormous, big-box American-style dice-roll-y game. Tactically rich and oozing with theme. All missions have totally come down to the wire so far, which makes for a lot of excitement.

As if that's not enough, it's basically two games in one since you can play an optional 1 vs 1 mode that has its own fascinating challenges in building your own squad and customizing a "command deck" from which you draw action cards. So much good game in one box.

Improvements over Descent 2nd Edition:
+ The X die result moved to one of the defense dice, to which not every figure has access to (only those without armor)
+ Instead of the questionable reinforcement rules (discouraging from combat), the "Overlord" now again uses threat tokens
+ After one of the hero players performed his turn, the Imperial player activates one of his figure groups (more interaction)
+ Every hero can rest to heal strain (surges) and/or damage on himself
+ Spending strain for movement is limited to 2 movement points per activation
+ Heroes have a wounded state with decreased stats. If all heroes are wounded, the Overlord often wins.
+ Attributes have an associated die instead of fixed numbers per hero
+ Line of sight is now traced from one attacker space corner to two defender space corners (non-reciprocal)
+ Player activations scale based on the number of players (same number of activations for all player counts)
+ The campaign guide is hidden information like in Mansions of Madness
+ There are side missions for both sides, explaining the back story of the characters, with unique rewards
+ The overlord chooses cards from 1 of 3 class decks providing abilities that are always available once purchased
+ Figures can move through enemy figures (at higher movement cost), so large figures cannot block passageways
+ The scenarios are no longer divided into two encounters, where the 2nd one often was impossible to win after losing the 1st
+ Skirmish mode is an excellent addition and a great alternative to the campaign game for two players

However, sadly, the game is again unbalanced. Some missions are nearly impossible to win for a certain side. FFG needs to improve their playtesting a lot, since this is a general problem present in ALL of their scenario-based games: Descent 1st Edition, Descent 2nd Edition, Battles of Westeros, Mansions of Madness, Tide of Iron, TannhÃ¤user, Doom (2004), DOOM (2016) ... all suffer from balance problems.

Great tactical game. Interesting combat system, character development and scenarios. The only problem is with the campaign, that if one side is winning too much, their abilities become too powerful and it ruins the game balance. The bias isn't toward either side particularly, in my experience, just the one that is winning. Some rebel hero combinations are significantly weaker than others though.

This is possibly a properly developed game, building on much Descent experience, and it does look awesome. Matter is, I was never that impressed with Descent, and this borrowed most of its fatal flaws (to my taste). Adventures and campaigns may well be balanced and play smoothly, as games, but they have little to no simulation value, which is a big deal in something that should draw you into a galaxy far far away: incremental damage in the face of blasters and lightsabers is ridiculous (are these dudes being slowly grilled?), wandering around to find junk in crates when you're out on a sharp, well defined military mission is a misplaced dungeon crawling notion. Jumping over enemy figures, while it may work well as gaming solution, is not really representative of this kind of skirmishing with heavy infantry weaponry (aside from some Jedi acrobatics). At least they got rid of characters coming back after having gone to town, or whatever that was supposed to represent.

Even as a game, although I don't doubt it implies some relevant tactical and even strategic decisions, I don't find all that interesting.

And then, the flavour and storyline...as with most FFG products, these are plain laughable (Does anyone care about General Weiss, really!!?? Give me a break!!!! and don't even get me started on the flavour text...). In the end, many fast paced encounters do not equate to one big epic experience, in my book. Hence, I'm still waiting for the real SW 2-player grand strategy game, a la WOTR. But that's not the direction the hobby is taking, so my wait is likely to be indefinitely long. This is turning more into a general rant against the zeitgeist than anything else.

But then, all in all, I do want to own a big box with plastic Imperial Walker, wookies, and Darth Vader inside.

RATING: 9
I'm a big fan of 1vAll dungeon crawlers, and this is a good one. 

However, as a campaign game, it needs consistent players for campaign to deliver on its promises, which makes it not adaptable to any group or setting. For that reason I have a preference towards skirmish dungeon crawls like Claustrophobia or Super Dungeon Explore) at the moment.

But the immersion of a campaign game can't really be matched by one-shot scenarios if you have the group for it.

Feel of the game: Most missions I've played so far have you carefully choosing between pushing for your objective and taking damage, or stopping to kill stuff but slowing your progress. The heroes are very capable of killing everything, but don't have the time to do so. So it has sort of a "racey" feel with some exploration elements. Definitely not a pure combat game if that's what you're looking for; at times, some of my teammates seem slightly disappointed when I urge them towards the finish line while they'd rather kill something or avoid damage.

[hr]The balance between objectives and combat actually feels pretty damn good I think.I think this game is firing on all cylinders as far as achieving its goals goes, so upping design rating to 5.

Enjoying the campaign immensely.

fantastic "dungeon crawler" style game. shoot guns, wave light sabers, run across the map to the objective and survive. the ability to level up your heroes (or villains) between campaign episodes is awesome. also the "choose your own adventure" style flow to the campaign is just great. allows for lots of replayability. the 2 player skirmish mode is a load of fun too, except the game does not come with enough command cards for both players. each player would have to bring their own set which is kind of ridiculous.

It took me 10 plays before I began to write this comment.  The main reason for that is twofold:  1) How can I describe correctly enough what might be my favorite merge of all time (Descent/Star Wars) 2) What do I do with Descent?  So that's my problem here -- I'm afraid that Imperial Assault has somehow replaced my beloved Descent, and I don't know how to react to that.  I just know that I really love playing Imperial Assault!  Excellent, better-crafted campaign.  Fantastic minis that look great painted up.  Two different games in one box that are both excellent.  Seriously, the two-player Skirmish out of the box is really well done!  So for now, I'm all in, and we'll see where this goes.  *update* - the app release really gave this the surge to keep at the 10 spot.

Long set up time, partly due to the terrible box. Campaign is interesting but the strategy is dumbed down to 'run as fast as you can to the objectives and cross your fingers'. Scenarios are far more about customising a team and playing with skill so I much prefer them.

I wish the game had been zoomed out to cover twice the area so we could take part in larger battles. Many fights seem like they're about chasing someone down a corridor and running out of shooting range at about 10 meters with many guns. Just seems like the reimplementation of descent could have gone further towards creating a different experience altogether.

So yep I don't like half the game much. But the components and the scenarios make me feel like a kid again. And it's Star Wars so it gets some stupid amount of extra points.

Really a great, great game. I do like Star Wars and so the theme certainly helps my love here, but I like the system here - the symbols on the dice create for quick and efficient combat resolution while giving a unique flavor to all of the various characters. I can find myself imagining the combat going down and the system moves nice and quickly to feel like the action is there, and I haven't even gotten to play the campaign yet!

This is Star Wars Descent.  You are going to hear a lot of people saying that it is a totally different game and a new experience.  And to be fair, I think this is better than Descent and does a few things to fix some of the problems I had with that game which I otherwise really enjoyed.  But it is still just Descent with a Star Wars theme.

That's not a bad thing mind you.  I love Star Wars and I've got a ton of fantasy themed games so the Star Wars universe is an interesting change to the forumla that I quite enjoyed.  The game is played, if you've never played Descent before, with one player controlling the imperial Forces and 1-4 players controlling the rebel forces in a tactical battle/adventure campaign.  The campaigns are a series of missions that can be anything from straight up "eliminate the enemy forces" goals to escort or fetch missions.  There is also a persistence element which really gives the game replay value.  After each mission in a campaign both the imperial player and the rebel players will acquire new equipment and powers to improve them in future missions and the campaign is meant to form a cohesive story...which it doesn't really do.  It feels more like playing a video game RPG.  There are unrelated side quests and the main story itself jumps around but the persistence angle is still kind of nice.

The one main change from Descent that I enjoy most is the way alternating turns work.  In Descent the heroes would all get to act before the Overlord could act and a lot of times that ended with the Overlord behind on the board right from the get-go.  In this game the heroes and imperial player take alternating turns with each of their units instead of going all at once.  This allows for more tactical flow and balanced turns which of course makes the game more fun for everyone involved on both sides.

There is also a skirmish mode which is nice if you aren't interested in the campaign or just want another way to play with this product as a "one-of".  The skirmish mode is just a turn-based tactical battle between two players.  There are still scenarios that dictate the goals of that particular play and you can build armies yourself with certain amounts of points and special ability cards.  It's a nice addition, especially if you like games like that and want one with Star Wars characters.

I really do enjoy this game but probably won't follow it like I tried to follow Descent.  It is just too difficult to get a group together for the persistent campaign which is the main selling point and if you fool yourself into thinking you can it can be expensive to keep up with a Fantasy Flight product like this with all the character packs and expansions they release continually.

Being a lifelong fan of Star Wars in general, it didn't take alot of time for me to buy myself a boardgame connected to SW.

Having 4 players trying to beat 1 evil player makes it a wonderfull experience! The game has different stages and missions to complete making it a very long game.
The setup itself takes around 15 mins/mission, and if you're playing with people that overthink every single step, one mission can take up to 1,5 - 2 hours.

The game itself also gets regular (mini)expansions to upgrade your basegame. Having played the campaign multiple times (replayability is high), it's highly suggested buying some of the expansions afterwards. This gives you even more replayability making it a game you can play for weeks. However the pricetag on some of these mini-expansions (mostly characters + 1 extra mission) are somewhat high for not really needing them. The big expansions make the game even longer, and by buying these you'll be able to play the next set of mini-expanions.

However, it's not needed to buy the expansions if you have multiple groups of people! But having played the campaign 3 times (having different results and missions sometimes) makes me want to buy the expansions nonetheless.

So if you're into SW, you'll find this one of the better boardgames out there in the SW universe!

RATING: 9
Never played Descent so all the comments comparing these games are pretty useless.
Played 3 campaign games plus tutorial with 2 other players controlling 2 rebel heroes each. The players take the roll of rebel operatives embarking on missions for the Alliance. Initial campaign involves investigating the development of a new weapon by the Galactic Empire.
Gameplay occurs on a modular map/board formed by interlocking tiles that are set up according to a diagram in the campaign book. One player plays the bad guys (Imperial forces). There is a lot of running and gunning and combat is a main part of the game. Results are determined by rolling certain coloured dice that have diferent symbols on their faces.
Pros: - Star Wars
- Campaign games make for a nice overall focus of your time. Every time you play the game you're moving the story forward.
- Developing characters through skill upgrades and purchasing items
- well designed tiles are strong and fit together solidly and snugly
- nice minis
- lots of options for expansions 
Cons: - thematically, I'm not happy with some choices Fantasy Flight made for enemies. Probe droids guarding Imperial facilities? Royal guards hanging out on random planets?
- Setup can be long if you're not organized
- I sort my games pieces into baggies and sleeve my cards regardless, but you pretty much have to with this game seeing as there is no viable storage option in the box
- I like the idea of campaigns but I'm not sure I really care about this particular story. Also, when we finish what do we do next? There is replayability but the main story stays the same. What do you do when you finish a video game?
- lots of options for expansions that will cost $$

RATING: 8
A very enjoyable tactical skirmish game. I have played 2 campaigns so far and am midway through a third. Overall, I find the game an excellent step up from Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition). It changed some of the minor annoying rules in that game for the better and one major rule that helps the experience. It's no longer a "Heroes go, then monsters go" activation system, which I think is great for preventing players from becoming bored, and I especially like the change to put dodges on defense dice instead of misses on attack dice. There was usually nothing more deflating than missing an attack. 

That said, there are still some cracks in the faceplate. It is still not well-balanced; some missions will be entirely hopeless for the Rebels if the Imperial player is anywhere near competent. While the hidden mission design is interesting for the Imperial player, I often find it frustrating for the Rebels. For example, there was one mission my group played from one of the figure packs where the Rebels had to escort C-3PO down a corridor with rooms off to the side. They opened one of the side rooms and triggered some enemy spawns. There was a little tunnel linking the two rooms and the other room was locked, so they thought it would be a good idea to put C-3PO in the other locked room as they figured nothing would spawn in there until they decided to open the exterior door. Little beknownst to them, there actually was an active spawn point in that room that I didn't have to tell them about because of the mission secrecy rules, so I ended up spawning a Tusken Raider and defeating C-3PO in one fell swoop. This actually led to the abortion of that campaign, as two of the Rebel players were so incensed by the move that they didn't want to play anymore. Ultimately, I have to admit it seems a little unfair to have a game with missions designed purely around the Rebels activating unknown events that can completely wreck them. It trivializes future campaigns; Rebels will simply plan better once they know in advance, which makes the decision to keep quest information hidden suspect. 

I do like the game a lot, but I admit I am also turned off by the business model. I may pick up the Return to Hoth expansion, but I am turned off from buying anymore figure packs. It just doesn't feel like you get a requisite amount of value to the cost outlay and I don't play the 2 player Skirmish mode, so half of every figure pack is a giant waste of air for me. I really wish the Skirmish mode had been spun off into its own separate game.

I've found that, while I really enjoy this game, it's a difficult one to play as much as I'd like.

Aside from that, I love the mechanics in this game, and it sits enticingly on my shelf begging me to play it.

My rating is based on playing the game using the App to make it full cooperative. I don't think I will ever play the original 1 v all campaign due to the snow ball effect that happens after the first couple of missions. In my play through by the 3rd mission the game tilted so hard in the favor of the empire there was no coming back for the rebels. 

I have yet to play the 1 v 1 game however I can't see not liking it would decrease my overall score but it could improve it. 

My previous score before the app came out was a "6" based on the 1 v All campaign.

I like this in spite of myself and a lot of what I think about how games should be designed.  I like the theme, and I like dungeon crawling when it's not done totally incompetently.  This game is about half-competent, and apparently that is good enough.  I absolutely hate the line of sight rules.  My rating is far more about how much I want to play more of it then it is about how well designed I actually think it is.

I will always remember that this box was delivered after 10PM. It really came from the dark side.
I played the intro-mission and a side-mission against 2 legendary heroes and I can say I am curious to see more, even when I lost both missions. I like stories in games and this game brings stories. I hate to look things up during a game and you cannot avoid that in this game, but I can forgive that. I will run to join the dark forces if this does not reach 10 plays. I will update when I play skirmish mode.

Update: I played skirmish mode with preconstructed decks. What a blast: vader choked his last opponent to death after bombarding the heroes that were outside collecting artifacts several times. I will update when I construct armies.

I'm really divided over this. On the one hand I love it for being a Star Wars minis game with upgradeable characters, and fairly understandable rules. On the other hand I'm less impressed with the scenarios as written. Go to terminal, shoot at terminal, ignore stormtroopers stood around you in a semicircle blasting the crap out of you, win. I'd have liked some refinement that is lacking maybe due to a desire to get the product on the shelves, but there is a little bit of a 'that'll do' feeling about the campaign.

This game is best when you can get the same group of people over repeatedly to do a campaign from start to finish. The game is more of a run away to complete the mission and maybe have one guy distract the bad guys. Every mission is like this so it gets a little old. Also frustrating when people play and even though you tell them the mission goal, they end up trying to kill everything, usually ending up in that they die or the mission fails.

Skirmish mode was fantastic.  Looking forward to playing a ton more of it, but looking even more so to the campaign stuff which we will hopefully get to start up soon!

Campaign start is fantastic.  Some minute rules that you really need to get down but the gameplay more than makes up for it.  I don't think it will take forever to run a campaign and we will most likely be able to run another after we finish up.  I think this game has more replay-ability than we will be able to get to.

Cool game and I love Star Wars, but it seems to have a snowballing problem in our group. When I began to win as the Imperial player (Rebel Scum!), I simply couldn't stop and it's getting easier each time. Let's see the rest of the campaign and I'll revisit this. 

Have not tried the game in skirmish enough to really give it a rating. Seems cool though.

Edit: It's a good game, but I don't really have time to play a campaign.

The campaign version of this game is very detailed with a lot of theme and a fantastic story arc. This game is as close to an RPG as you can possibly get while still calling it a board game. The Imperial player essentially serves as the GM and oversees one of several dozen missions provided with the game. Both the Imperial and Rebel players receive XP and credits to spend on various equipment, abilities, and encounters as they advance through the campaign. The game also comes with skirmish or combat rules should players simply wish to battle it out. The combat rules are also used in the campaign game and are easy to understand, yet very well done.

Absolutely no-brainer. I want this. 

However... it is just too damn expensive. Over â¬75,- for an incomplete game. Ridiculous.

Yes, it got the 'hot' factor. Yes, it got Star Wars. Yes, it got a lot of miniatures, but so does a secondhand copy of DnD The Adventury Game which I can pick up for â¬5,-. Yes, it builds on a great system (Descent 2.0) and improves on it on some points (most notably the turn structure). Yet...

The box is oversized to justify the ridiculous selling price. Oh wait, FFG tells me "there should be air" because you will buy expansions. Right? Oh right, you've spent already a â¬75,- on this game. Ah well, we know you'll be stupid enough to not remember that if a seemingly decent but factually overpriced expansion comes knocking. We have already six lined up and as we are FFG, you can count on us to expand this game untill you, your friends and even we are sick of it.

By then, you have shelled out massive amounts of money on this game, it has become a completely unplayable piece of junk (Arkham Horror, anyone?) and we move on to the next 'biggest thing'.
Perhaps bringing out a 'deluxe version' of the base + some random (complete) set of expansions so far in order to really piss off early adapters.

Feel some FFG frustration here? You bet. I love a game being complete, playable from the base and no expansions needed anymore. That is why I will ALWAYS favor Battlelore 1st ed over second. Or Thunderstone over advanced. Or any other discontinued line in my book. I hate a company that treats its customer as the stupid money sheep they time and time again prove to be. Even though it puts out great games with great components I love to play.

Now why did I start this rant? Because this game is not only set on the 'premium' end of the price-point, but they deliberately left out pieces out of the base box! Counters, instead of minis, which are only to be had if you shell out more money. It feels like a slap in the face, hitting harder because you've already spent so much money and are 'locked in' into liking this game.

Its like buying a Ferrari. After you've spent your life-savings on it, it will take some time before you are emotionally able to admit it is a crap car on the road. Now, I'm not saying Imperial Assault is a crap game (it wouldn't be high on my wish list if it was), but I find it insulting that a games company puts out an incomplete game at such a price point. 

Will be hunting for a second hand copy, hopefully including all the expansions to make the base game playable (without introducing more holes to patch with other expansions) at a reasonable price point. Will this take a long time? Probably. But I can wait as there are plenty of other great games to go around.

Another top 5 games for me, mostly for its theme.  If your a fan of StarWars, then buy and own ever part of this game cause its worth the money. Each miniature, card, token, and board piece just oozes the Force.  The game play is much more streamlined then its predecessor, Descent: A Journey Into Darkness.  Additionally the Skirmish mini game within the full games, gives you an awesome alternative to playing with a full group.  More bang for your buck if you will.  If your a fan of dungeon crawlers and Overlord player mechanics you'll love this game, with or without loving Star Wars.  As if that's possible.

I like the idea of Imperial Assault, perhaps more than I actually enjoyed the game. We played 5 player scenarios; that means that each player (excluding the DM) takes 1 turn in 10. That's too much downtime for a light-ish dungeon crawl.

There's also far too many tokens and statuses, in classic FFG style. The scenarios also seem fairly random - with the hidden spawn points having a real impact on the game depending on which route you take.

I've recently been playing Heroscape and it's amazing how clean the design of that is compared to this.

Still, I fairly enjoyed this and I'd happily play it 2-3 player in future. I won't be buying it though - when I went to log it, it would appear that there are already 5 or 6 expansions planned.

Update: I don't like it with 5 players. Especially if you're playing as the (not quite a) Jedi character. Too many of her turns are move-attack or even attack-attack again. Rolling 2 dice twice every ten turns is not enough decisions in a 90 minute game. With 2 (playing campaigns) it is swamped with cards and text. 3-4 players might be the sweet spot. At that player count, it's a pretty good game. 

Though I'm still pretty convinced that the scenarios are massively imbalanced in places and deciding whether or not to even attempt a secondary objective can condemn the entire mission to failure, or sometimes there's no hope to begin with.

ImpAss is still very much a case of "fun, but..."

Update: Just play the skirmish game instead. I'm pretty sure that's what this is mostly intended as.

Played once with another player.  It seemed nearly impossible to kill his guys!!  I guess I was playing it wrong though...seems the only way to defeat opponent is to restrict their access to the win conditions...though maybe this was just a 2 player anomaly.

I think I feel better playing this one occasionally, although I'm lucky having a very great group and a dedicated guy to carry on the torch. The campaign system is great and I still have to play the Skirmish game, but the scenarios are interesting at the beginning, then slowly you start to make decisions which regretfully feel less and less tactical and more gamey.

Theme doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid, so the rating reflects not as much the game but the good times I have when we get together.

I am completely enamored with Imperial Assault. It's everything I want out of a trashy dicefest dungeon crawl: pretty components, breezy mechanics, high drama, character progression, SIDE MISSIONS aaa.

The branching campaign metagame is such a clever yet obvious evolution of the HeroQuest/Descent 'thing,' but it totally makes the experience.

Playing this made me realize how much I love the Star Wars IP. Now I have to go read all the extended universe books like a fucking megadork.

Here are five reasons I am not a fan:

1) First, the games story seems shallow.  I will admit, we only started playing this game recently, but I would have expected a more detailed intro about who the characters were, what it was we were doing, perhaps more detail surrounding what caused us to be going on all of these missions, or even what caused them to meet one another.  Worst of all, the story seems like something I could write in 10 minutes right before I left to play games with my friends, it lacks complexity and feels like a generic MMO mission.

2) It tries to be a tactical game while allowing for completely blind changes.  The whole idea of having unknown information, especially information which allows large amounts of imperials to be summoned, makes it almost impossible to plan ahead, which is the very definition of tactics.  It essentially turns into a luck game of what corridor you decided to run down, or if you did or didn't keep your people together since you have no idea what will happen.

That being said, random chance is okay when the chance has bounds placed on it.  As an example, when I play a tactical game like Warhammer 40K, I know the die can't go above 6, and I have an idea how many they roll.  Even when playing a card game, I have an idea of the cards that might be drawn.  True unknown information like plot twists and major power-shifts belong in a true story RPG with a DM not a game more about tactics and positioning than story.

3) Because players can't check everything the imperial is playing (or at least so I am told) there is no good ability to fact-check rules against the imperial player, which makes point 4 worse:

4) The movement and line-of-sight mechanics are sometimes to the point of not making any sense at all.  Warhammer for example, has complex movement and line-of-sight, but it is based on real-world principles so it at least makes sense.  You can even guess as to what cover might or might not give you an advantage, and where you would be safe. On the other side of the coin, games like chess have clear cut movement.  But somehow in this game, with a grid like chess, they managed to make the movement and line-of-sight more complicated than warhammer yet less-clear and precise.  This is also seen in forum posts where no one can agree on a few particular mechanics, particularly involving large bases and special abilities like pounce.

5) The last problem with the game is persistent leveling.  When I play a tactical game and lose brutally to a player, it is nice to know we can come back and start again on the same playing field.  That is not really possible in this game.  Which again, I would have no problem with if it was Co-Op or story driven, but this game has a competitive tactical edge which makes the whole concept of persistent leveling stressful.

In summary, I feel like this game tries to weave story into what is otherwise a tactical game, which causes both the story and tactics to suffer.  There are better story games out there and better tactical games out there, don't waste your time with this one.

First session of a campaign (Tutorial + 2 missions). That was really enjoyable. The game is easy to understand with great thematic and great tactical co-op play. Narrative is pretty well adapted to what you have to do.
Rate 8.5 for now, but probably gonna raise it as we play more games.
Raised to 9 after 2 more missions. I like how planning BEFORE starting is important. It's not just about rushing and fighting your ennemies. You really need to take a few minutes to plan carefuly with your team (as rebels) in order to be successful or at least have a chance. This shows great tactical design.

Probably a cons would be that it can be a bit long to set up as you have a specific set up for each mission, but a wise Imperial Player should be able to prepare this at least for 50% (at least for the start of each new session).

PS: I am not a Star Wars fan, but the thematic was still awesome !

I have only played the tutorial session using the cooperative app and the person teaching it didn't have a good grip on how the app worked.  It was pretty unengaging.

The Good: Production quality is top-of-the-line. The minis, cards, map tiles, and dice are all excellent quality. The rules are simple, but the game is not without its intricacies.  The base game includes a lengthy campaign, as well as the option of skirmish play. The main characters, while created for the game, "feel" like Star Wars characters, at least as far as they're fleshed out (which isn't much). The game is strategic and fun, although I prefer All VS The Game to 1 VS All games.

The Bad: Fantasy Flight includes main characters in token form only, forcing you to buy the separate figure/card packs to flesh out the game. The gameplay can be incredibly repetitive, too, but that is tied to the type of game that it is. Scenarios offer different objectives, but they do not change gameplay much.

A fantastic re-implementation of the Descent mechanics, I think they really improved almost everything that was just a bit off with second edition. And a Star wars retheme is a great idea! The campaign is wonderful, and after playing skirmish, I am loving this game! With the addition of the app, this game achieves legend status.

I don't like miniatures.  Never even played a miniatures game.  Most of my friends don't like miniatures because we are mostly card game players...until Imperial Assault came out.

We found ourselves playing campaigns and skirmishes for hours.  Sometime we would play for 8 hours straight.  Now our entire gaming group has a copy.  

This came is really magical and is probably going to be one of the very few games that I owned which will get a 10.

I can say that this is the best Star Wars Boardgame ever released. The dungeon crawler, the miniatures, the system, everything in the game makes you feel that you are in the Star Wars universe.
The thematic way that the game deals makes you really feel like a Empire Commander or a Rebel.
The only problem I can see in this game is that it needs a regular group to play the campaign.

Good game, however, I don't enjoy the ground combat as much as the dog fights in X-Wing. Plus x-wing already comes with painted minis, which is a big bonus. I'm big into realism, so playing with a copy of this game that already had painted minis would bump the experience up for me.

I was super pumped to get this game on release, but I never got a group together. I even felt like I wasted cash on a Broken Token insert and multiple expansions. The best I could do was to play it in an simple version with my son.

I even printed up the custom solo variant by RedJak, but never felt the compulsion to try it.

But now the game hits my table thanks to the Legends of the Alliance app! I was looking for a campaign mode for Mansions of Madness 2E, and luckily this delivers what I was looking for without needing more purchases (I havenât played Descent).

The game is very much a tactical strategy game (akin to XCOM the video game), with very mild RPG elements. It feels good, especially with the constant drip of new items and abilities to power up the heroes. Because the game emphasizes combat, you will see each Imperial model in your collection repeatedly, which makes things a little bland. Map setup can be cumbersome with its plethora of small and odd shaped pieces. But the game is fun, and I am greatful for FFG to invigorate new life into the product basically for free.

This is a fantastic game in the dungeon crawl genre. I really like the ongoing campaign, and the fact that the Imperial player can do their best to defeat the rebels (as opposed to an RPG, where the GM is more of a storyteller and arbitrator).

RATING: 4
Too much of a war-game to be a good RPG, too much luck to be a good board-game, too constricted to be a good war-game.  
I must admit that, given the hype, I was expecting the same 'wow' moment I got from playing X-Wing the first time. Sadly IA is nowhere near the same league. Or even the same galaxy. 
Loooong mission set up times, more snoozing between player turns, and a game system that is almost solely based on lucky dice rolls. To be fair X-Wing is dice driven as well, but X-Wing doesn't take 2 hours+ per mission...
The worst part of the game however are the 'pop-up' baddies that totally destroy any game immersion. In our third game we had 3 storm troopers, a crewed E-Web blaster AND an AT-ST walker just appear in our area. "Where the heck did they come from?" We asked the GM. After considering for a minute: "Erm, they were hiding behind a locker?"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
My group is loving this game. The Empire is strong early in the campaign until the heroes start leveling up and maxing out the equipment. Even then, the increasing threat level allows the Empire to throw out more or stronger characters more regularly later in the campaign. It's a great balance that requires skills for either side.

More of everything I enjoyed about Descent 2e. Rules are refined and seem to be improved from d2e. Component quality even better than Descent. Stunning. Depending on the quality of the campaign this score could increase.

Edit: After finishing the campaign, I think the quest design is probably better than descent, making this mechanically better in all ways. 

Not sure if it's ok to write but, I am a bit bored of the Star Wars setting. So much marketing for the new film. With an original setting, this would be a 9.

I really want to like this game.  I like the theme and I like the idea that doing missions have effects on later missions, but everything just feels so horribly balanced in the Empire's favor that it's not fun.

It's crazy because this is a game where we, the rebel players, have to go up against a larger group of ever-spawning enemies.  You'd think that because of the overwhelming numbers we'd have in general stats than those enemies but you'd be wrong.  We may have anywhere from 2-3 more HP than the enemies, but our attacks are much weaker.  In a single turn, the Empire player can almost take down a player where we get happy when we do 2 damage.

But that's when we even hit the player because we also have worse defenses.  Where we either have a single white (bad) or black (good) defense die, the Empire player almost always seems to have black dice, multiple dice, and/or things that buffs their defense.  As a Force Adept it literally feels like I'm running up to a probe droid and waving a wet noodle in its face.  Even the wookiee isn't doing much better.  Most of our damage comes from unblockable things like cleave and blast, but unfortunately that's an insignificant amount of damage.

That said, when we do manage to damage an enemy, the infinitely spawning probe droids just heal whatever is hurt.  When we aren't doing damage, the probe droids proceed to murder us.  In the off chance we get close to killing a probe droid, it just explodes on us and another spawns.

Fighting in that game is just hopeless for the rebel players.  We tried the first few missions killing enemies and we were just getting our butts handed to us.  So this most recent mission we tried running since fighting was pretty inefective.  That mostly worked, until half way through the mission a weakened slow person needed to be escorted through a gauntlet of enemies we left behind.

See, these missions are puzzles that you have zero way of knowing the right answer.  If you fight, you die.  If you ignore enemies, they catch up and murder you or eventually kill your goal.

Nothing just feels right in this game because it feels so unbalanced.  The Empire player gets to constantly respawn, they have gadgets like cloaking that gives them more dice, jet packs that let them ignore terrain, and all sorts of bonuses that help them out.  THe rebel players get some powers and equipment, but at a much slower pace so we're constantly outclassed.

I like a difficult game, but this game just isn't fun.

I loved Imperial Assault. My friend and I played through the campaign once so far, though I haven't tried the skirmish rules yet. We were a little unclear on the mission structure at times. The threat that the Imperial player generates leads to tense games, but sometimes it felt overwhelming and too hard, and the last scenario felt almost impossible at that point, but still so fun. It's the best Star Wars board game for me.

RATING: 8
Immense fun with the correct group.  

Improves on a number of mechanics from Descent without losing excitement.  Love the implementation of the Star Wars universe.   I do find the player characters to be a bit limited and competitive balance makes some barely usable but there's more than enough game to explore.   

The individual levels aren't terribly long, but the overall length of the campaign can dominate a number of game nights, but, again, the right group makes it well worth it.

This game has been a bit of a let-down, I was hoping it would my go-to "dungeon crawler" and 2 player skirmish game for years to come.  Having played through the campaign though, it just felt more like a chore to me.  Too many imbalances, too many "rush to goals and ignore opponent" missions, a lot of downtime from AP, extremely long setup.  

The game is solid, I enjoy it a decent amount, but I had very high hopes.

Lot of stuff in the box.  The campaign is pretty good the game isn't balanced but the players can do it.  The Empire has a lot more to keep track of than the rebels, even if one player controls all four heroes.

So there is really no price issue.

RATING: 8
The light side:
Surprisingly great game even if I wasn't a star wars fanboy. Bought it for the theme and minis. Also wanted to try painting and as I missed out on Descent a redo in SW universe seemed like a good time to try it out. Turns out the game itself is also very good. So far only played skirmish but there is a real tactical fight there, not only a dicefest. Excited on seeing how good the game continues to be after the expansions.

The dark-side:
Initial feeling with the expansions is that they are an outright moneygrab by FFG. This is the only negative thing about the game. Comparing the base-game versus the equally expensive full first wave of expansions I have to say the current FFG mini-expansion model feels like a complete rip-off. One can only draw one conclusion, FFG are the EA of boardgames. It should not be legal that they hook me with the base game providing 100% fun, then charge me the same for mini-expansions that only provide 20% more content. And even worse is the model that they withhold content from the base-game and split it up into mini-expansions, I'm looking at the missions and command cards especially. In the long run FFGs actions will bring about their own demise, if karma exists... which I doubt.
Why can't FFG do the honorable thing and simply release big and small-box expansions with a fair price instead of this business model based on leeching "whales".

Rating changed to 10 after campaign play has proven itself. The game has a good desperate atmosphere and my fears of the campaign being a dud were unfounded. The twists and turns have really challenged us and the character development has clear progression from peashooter to ultimate killing machines. Still hating the business model but I have gotten decent value on my investment.

Rating changed to 9.5 after a few more campaign missions. For us 2/4 side missions have been an absolute pain to play and are based on the sole mechanic of deatmatch... this does not work in IA. I hope we just happened to pick the only two side missions that absolutely suck. Story missions have so far not let us down.

Rating dropped to 8 after finishing the base game campaign. The campaign was so imbalanced it was mostly a lesson in futility for the rebels after the half-way point of the campaign. At that point there was really no reason to play, we had practically lost before even starting. Imperial powerups had made the ordinary cannon fodder stormtroopers have boosted health and more firepower than a hero. A single activation by the imperial player always resulted in a wounded hero if they got in range of a healthy hero. Rating for campaign: 6. I know this campaign might be balanced in some gamegroups but I also know that in those groups they chose the stupid one to play the imperial side. Only reason this stays above an 8 is that the skirmish still works and the campaign wasn't all bad at the beginning before powerups and unachievable objectives destroyed it. But I expected more/at least some balance when paying premium price. None of us, imperial player included could think of any other way for the rebels to win than by epic dicethrowing. We tried playing smart, only killed those we had to to prevent getting wounded. We tried playing hard, killing everyone. We tried running through. The outcome was always the same, imperial victory by a large margin. Also the scripted events are mostly just plain stupid! How are the rebel heroes supposed to know that this time you shouldn't advance the mission and that you should position yourself in a certain way or be doomed to fail.

It's better than Descent 2nd edition, which was utterly boring. Neither this or Descent 2nd edition replace Descent 1st edition.

I'm sure this is a great game for a group of five Star Wars fans, but as I'm not a Star Wars fan and mostly play with two, it's an excessively chromed tactical combat game that has to be played as a campaign.

I got out of the system when FFG released Â£59 of expansions, all iconic figures from the movies. I don't think I'm their target market, and I'm sticking with Krosmaster Arena and Earth Reborn for a tactical skirmish game.

Quite possibly the perfect board game insofar as capturing the theme (Star Wars) exactly, is challenging, and also a blast to play. The only thing I find after playing it is that I want to play more of it and I want more expansions. All my buddies think about when we aren't playing it is when we are going to play it again. We eat drink and sleep SW:IA. 

My only concern about the game is that after playing it once or twice then some of the missions won't be so exciting (because all the hidden information will be known), but the good thing here is that many missions aren't played in a single play through so there is a degree of inherent longevity there, and also I am sure FFG will release quite a few expansions to keep things fresh (which, personally, I enjoy expanding my games).  And finally, the saving point here is that after playing 10 or so missions then odds are you may remember some vague things about the first few missions, but probably won't remember (as rebels) exactly where the Imperial reinforcement points were, or exactly what happened when the door opened.

As always with FFG, the components are of the highest quality. They have really spoiled my buddies and I there, everything else we play we seem to find lacking.

Love the new app.  Played app campaign twice.  It is good.  Makes a game where I had to play two sides into a one sided event.  On normal difficulty able to win fairly easy with 2 and 3.  Want to try 4 before playing harder.  If more content would probably rate this a bit higher.  Hard to say if I prefer this over TM.  Different type of game have to be in mood for.  Always ok to play a Euro but need certain mind set for tactical dice chucking mini game.  Playing less times a year over TM though does not mean I would necessarily rate it lower then TM.  This is most definitely my favorite dice chucking game.  I have tried several.  Compared to Sword & Sorcery this has less other things to track.  It is easier to remember special powers for each character over S&S.  I use S&S since that would be my next favorite dice chucker dungeon crawler.

First game of this genre I bought when I got into the hobby. Coming from an RPG world, It was easy to get into. I had a great time playing as the overlord / empire (being a GM, this was also an easy transition). I was ecstatic when Legends of the Alliance finally came out. Thanks FF, you made my year!

Components are top notch, game play is fast and easy (again, coming from an RPG world), and setting is great.

fantastic game!! first dungeon crawl system I played and I I love it.  definitely feel that the minis need to be painted in order to be immersed in the theme.  but I love the system.  I think the battle system is balanced and is great for dice mitigation.  I love that the rebels have these crazy abilities, but still have a tough time with the empire.  I LOVE DMing for the game, playing as the empire and deciding the course of the game and when to do what is an awesome roll.  Fantastic game I don't see my love for this game stopping, and duh it's Star Wars!

I love this game. Particularly skirmish mode. The set up time is the clunkiest part, especially for new skirmish players since there are so many options but it's a great collection of flavor in the characters (especially the mercenaries) which corresponds to cool actions they can do. There is a decent amount of luck to the game when it comes to rolling dice but the strategy really comes in to setting up your troops and embracing character abilities. Also there's tremendous replay value. I would play this any time I get the chance.

Update 6/2016: I increased it to 10. Every time I play a skirmish I love it more because of its intricacies and want to play it more. Yes I love Star Wars in general but that's not all that's at work. It's the fact that every game is a tense game where there isn't a clear leader for a few rounds. Several times I've had a commanding lead for points and board placement only to lose it in the end or vice versa. Part of that is dice rolls, part of that is that most skirmish maps have at least 2 distinct things going on such as multiple ways to score extra points or damaging effects caused by things separate from the main objective. You can half ass go after both locations and possibly get mowed over if your opponent goes all in on 1 of the 2 or you sent a scout 1 way to do something to lure 1 or 2 of their people away, or blah blah blah. It's fun.

Then the Star Wars flavor on top of that makes it even more fun. Just because I can quasi relate to the characters having seen the movies, shows, read books, etc countless times. So despite 1 character maybe not being the easiest to do well with, I want to make them work so I keep trying new variations to a build to make them more effective. 

Anyways, I could go on forever. Solid 10.0 in my book. Best game in my collection. 

Update 5/2017: About 1/3 of the way through my first campaign (Return to Hoth) as the Imperial Player and it's still really fun. But as the Imperial that has 30+ skirmish plays, it's important to not go for the throat and play at your absolute best otherwise you will crush morale so much nobody will want to play after back to back to back losses. They're good losers when they lose but it feels hopeless after a while. So play nice if they're new!

[i]Preliminary mid-campaign rating from an unexperienced Rebel player perspective:[/i]

I'm a born eurogamer so these kind of games aren't really for me. That said, I still think that Imperial Assault is really cool. I love the theme and the overall flow of the gameplay. I wish the campaign was more immersive though, every mission feels like a separate bit, there's no continuous narrative. 

The only major downside I've encountered so far is the fact that the campaign missions are rather unballanced - one side often has a distinct advantage over the other and this can be pretty frustrating, especially if you come from a eurogaming background (but maybe the missions are supposed to be unballanced and they were intentionally designed as such).

I only know a small portion of the game - I've yet to play as an "overlord" and I've never tried the skirmish mode so far. Once I get the hold of every aspect of the game the rating might go up (and it probably will). All in all, if you like Star Wars universe and enjoy ameritrash style of gaming then Imperial Assault is a must-have.

RATING: 7
I have played in three different campaigns at this point, two of which as Imperials.  I really love this one.  It feels like Star Wars.  Some of the scenarios are unbalanced.  It is up to your group to decide if you are going to play all out every game, or if you will have an unspoken agreement that "fun" is valued over the win/loss.  The DM in me likes to let the players have a good game, but I wouldn't give it away either.  

My latest complaint (which may be group specific) is that the Heroes take a long time on their turns. They talk, plan, strategize...all great things. And I, as the Imperial player, sit and wait, and wait, and wait. I have had some games were the literal majority of my time is spent waiting. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The main reason why this is a shorter version of descent is because most of the scenarios are "clear the objective within x rounds" or "survive for x rounds" 

Thematic wise, everyone shooting and attacking me, but i'm ignoring them to punch computers or pick up spices.

If you know me, you know that I love Star Wars (the original trilogy, anyway). I grew up with it. I made friends through it. In a very roundabout sort of way, I met my wife because of it. And as long as I've loved Star Wars, I've loved Star Wars games. Particularly, the Star Wars RPG.

So, when I finally got a chance to pick up this game, I was fairly impressed. The theme is well-represented, the components are great and the game play is action-packed. Playing it feels like a Star Wars adventure.

So, what is it that holds this game back a bit for me? The answer is a little complicated but it boils down to a few basic complaints. The core system can get a little cluttered at times, which can slow down the action. With so many abilities, symbols and conditional rules, it can feel a little too big for its britches once in a while. Also, the delicate balance of the Imperial player's game can be awkward. I rather suspect that once the co-op app is released for this game, some of these issues will be addressed and the game could stand to climb quite a bit higher for me.

As it is, even with a few warts, it's still a great game with lots of appeal.

This fixes some problems I had with Descent (and as a result I'm selling Descent), namely the downtime between players and Imperial player (overlord) and the imbalance between the twoâI definitely feel like you don't have to hold back as the Imperial player. I also like how reinforcements are handled: you get them, but you have to slowly earn them, they're not free and your currency persists between rounds in the campaign.

The theme does less for me than Descent, but I'll be keeping this one.

Post Death Star, a new Imperial threat. Tactical miniatures game to run leveled up squad-based campaign missions or point-spend skirmishes mode. As the campaign threat level goes up, forces gear up with item cards, bolster their class deck.  Meanwhile the Imperial forces advance their agenda cards and their class cards. Named heroes and bad guys start showing up in the later stages of the campaign.

This game is amazing. The figures, the mechanics, the theme - everything is top notch. The campaign is a really enjoyable experience that goes back and forth between the two teams. Overall it feels balanced and is so much fun I really want to play it more and more and more. 
The skirmish is a bit underdeveloped, but it has great potential. Together with the small villain/all-packs and future expansions I think this 2nd game in this game will shine just as bright as the campaign. Still it's great entertainment for 2 players. I even had a 24h session only playing the skirmish, that says a lot about a game!

RATING: 10
This game is a bit of a hard one to rate for me.  Star Wars was such an integral part of my childhood, it is impossible to objectively review this game as just a game, but I will try.

There are two main modes of play, campaign and skirmish.  Campaign mode in my experience has been hit or miss depending on the mission.  On some levels, the rebels are vastly out matched and will have a difficult time winning.  On other levels, it is less of a challenge.  The rebel players have to play a lot of the levels perfectly to have a shot at winning and hope that imperial player makes a mistake they can take advantage of or lucky rolling.  This changes from mission to mission based on the number of rebel players.  With 3 rebel heros, one gets an extra activation per round.  This makes some tasks much more manageable.  Especially when they have to rush to interact with certain things.  With 4 heros, these maps are more challenging.  Overall it is both fun and frustrating to play through.  Unlike other games that have a dungeon master who's job it is to make the game challenging, interesting, but winnable (with some potentially difficult decisions), this game pits one imperial player against all other players.  If the map favors the imperial player, and the imperial player doesn't show mercy or pull the punches a bit, it can be a painful experience for the rebel players.  As the imperial player you have to sometimes act more like a DM than an actual player.  It's a bit hard while the rebels constantly mow through your troopers and other figures like they were paper dolls to create a situation that is winnable for the rebels when it is in your favor.  It just feels good to be about finally give them a good beating.  The imperial player also has pre-knowledge of certain locations on the map that will be important allowing them to huddle troops there or do other things that make the missions really hard for rebels but are thematically wonky.  I once had a Nexu that could have attacked a player, like a Nexu probably would with disregard for anything else.  Instead, I used it to block a walkway creating a separation between the two groups of the rebel team causing them to have to defeat the Nexu before regrouping, wasting a round taking care of that instead of completing the mission objectives.  As a result, they failed by a few activations.  Strategically the move was the best for my "team".  It wasn't very thematic and ruined the feel of the whole match.  Campaign mode is rife with these types of issues where the imperial player often has to play in the spirit of the characters and map rather than play to win, otherwise it can ruin the game for everyone.

Skirmish mode is a completely different mode of playing this game, and one that I really enjoy.  You "deck-build" your team of figures and your command cards to create your squad.  Only then do you find out what mission you will play.  So you might form a heavy hitting, small quantity, and slow moving team only to find out that the mission requires a bit more mobility, or via versa.  You have to figure out how to adapt your team to best meet the goals and defeat the other team.  There is ton of potential to customize your group and find all kinds of interesting groups to bring down.  This currently only plays 2 people, though I hear the next full expansion coming out will open skirmish mode to 4 player matches.  Skirmish mode ends up being a lot more tactical.  You adjust to what your player is doing.  Campaign mode is a bit more strategic.  You have mission objectives and while you might have to handle things that come up that the imperial player does, often you have to ignore them and just grind towards the goal regardless.  It is that tactical feel of skirmish that I like.  You can't just follow a plan coming into a match.  You have to carefully decide which figures to use in which order to maximize your damage potential, minimize the damage you could take, or limit the options or your opponent.  Each move matters and is important.  Where as in campaign mode "move towards the objective" is often one, if not both, of the actions on nearly half of the turns.

With all that said, it is a solid game where a couple of mistakes can be the difference between winning a match and losing a match.  It is great to see the power shifting slightly back and forth and you see people make slight mistakes and see how finely balanced the game is (at least in skirmish mode).  

I would probably give this game an 8 or so if it was themed differently.  But with a star wars theme, I just can't help but want to play it, even if the matches are sometimes frustrating.  It still is very enjoyable to be in the Star Wars world controlling the characters.  And for me, that just puts it over the top.

I'm not sure who playtested this garbage, but they should be hauled out behind the chemical sheds at dawn, and shot in the back of the head. The scenarios are so laughably imbalanced one way or another that the game is boring.

It's thematically wrong (apparently Hoth Wampas and Snowtroopers are allied, and Imperial Royal Guard are lurking in every corridor in the Star Wars universe).

Badly designed (but better than Descent at least). The production is certainly high quality. The materials and miniatures are everything you might expect from FFG.  However, every time anyone suggests playing this dross, a little part of me dies inside.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Unsurprisingly, skirmish mode doesn't appeal to me at all.  Lighthearted killing belongs in multiplayer bash-a-thons such as King of Tokyo, Star Wars Epic Duels, Nexus Ops, and Bucket King - not in two-player space operas with overly earnest flavor text.

The campaign mode is a shiny iteration of the Descent/Doom system, though not quite good enough to own.  If my kids were younger and had insatiable Star Wars appetites, this would be a sure-fire purchase.  Nowadays Descent 2nd edition delivers the goods for my high-humor adult and family gaming groups, though strictly as light filler.

Imperial Assault's biggest drawback is that the scenarios aren't nearly as interesting as those in Descent.  The Descent designers gave themselves permission to be inventive and nuts, whereas in IA they limited themselves to dry, run-of-the-mill Star Wars serials.  That was not the best choice, as humor and imagination have long been a hallmark of the franchise.

I also hate the expansion model for this one.  I can play [u]with[/u] Han and Chewbacca as allies, but I can't play [u]as[/u] Han and Chewbacca? And I have to pay separately for them?  Bleah.

I've had mixed experiences with Descent. I'm fully aware I'll never paint the minis (I've learned the lesson enough times to forgo even thinking about trying). But its reception is very good, and the theme speaks not only to me, but to one of my favorite co-players, and two is not a bad player count. So while I don't think I'm going to invest the fortune it would take into all the expansion packs, I would like to give the base game a go.

Virtually every 1 on 1 game I own I turn to before Imperial Assault but the skirmish mode does get played every once in awhile.

The main campaign mode is definitely the main attraction, however it's so difficult to get to the table that I simply can't assess it.

Based on skirmish alone this is a hard sell. It's a fun game and if you want that star wars ground combat go for it.

Good dungeon crawler with excellent quality minis and interlocking map components.   Have to apply some heavy criticism and knock off at least 1 or 2 points for the large expansion boxes that show characters that don't actually come in the expansion.  Not sure why the Twin Shadows expansion with its box blatently featuring Boba Fett does not actually include Boba Fett?  ...borderline false advertising, probably not even borderline.  Hoth doesn't include the Echo Base Rebels?  Bespin doesn't include Lando? Jabba's Realm does not include Jabba!  It's really pretty ridiculous.

I've only played skirmish so far, but it's a lot of fun.

The rules aren't too bad, it's a little slow at first but speeds up quickly ... except for the map building, that's always going to be slow unless you print out pre-made maps.

Gave it a try, a bit try. 2 days gaming it where we played the Tutorial and 6 Campaign missions. But couldn't finish it.
There are 3 things that just make me dislike this game a lot.
This game has some serious issues that suck the fun out.Â It felt like playing check, where you had 3 other players deciding and discussion all moves and permutations with you.Â Every single move, every single decision, every single doubt...
Second, it felt (and played) like no matter what we'd choose, the Empire would always wins. The game feels like is pending to the Empire, in a hard way. Sure, the Empire has the same issues as the Rebels, but if he/she makes any serious effort, then the Rebels are crushed. Otherwise, if the Empire pulls back, then it's not fun either.
And last, all this is made worse by the fact thatÂ there was so many rules checking and unclarity that the first 2 or 3 games just took us way too much time.

The theme and story in this game are immersive and it creates a great game experience. The rules are nicely streamlined compared to older FF games and it makes for fast, interactive, tactical play. Balance can be a bit of an issue on some campaign missions but losing feels less punishing than Descent and the balance overall seems better to me so far. The skirmish game is nicely balanced and offers a good one-off game opportunity that will only improve as more content gets released.

Really looking forward to the App.

First impression isn't what I expected.
Beautiful, inspiring artwork, miniatures and cards. Simple to learn, great campaign system in theory. (Have not played a full campaign, so cannot say)
Limited number of turns are a big turn off. They encourage a single style of play: "run for the objectives, ignore all else". The "DM" has multiple ways of winning and knows the conditions and upcoming surprises while the players do not. 
There's great potential for fun, but my first impression was one of frustration. Limited options, a single way of winning while the DM has two to three (time limit, wounding the heroes, blocking the objectives) and the statistical probability of victory seems highly stacked against the heroes.
I know for a fact that this game is fun and I want it to be, but I may look at alternative ways of playing or house rules.

Ahhoz kÃ©pest, h tudtommal nem szeretem a dungeon crawlereket, ezzel baromi jÃ³t jÃ¡tszottam. Persze, a tÃ©ma hatalmasat dobott rajta,, de vhogy jobban Ã¶ssze is Ã¡llt az egÃ©sz, mint anno a DnD egy prÃ³bÃ¡lkozÃ¡s utÃ¡n. (Ãs az a vilÃ¡g annyira nem is Ã©rdekel.) Nagyon jÃ³ lenne egy Ã¡llandÃ³ csapat hozzÃ¡, el tudom kÃ©pzelni, ahogy egymÃ¡s ellen feszÃ¼lnek a fÃ©nykardok Ã©s tÃ¶bb missiont is lejÃ¡tszunk szÃ©p sorban...

Has base game along with 5 of the add-ons.  Really enjoy this game but I couldn't get a consistent group for playing it.  Its only been used maybe 5 times for some of the first missions
Has Chewbacca add on, IG-88 add on, Han Solo add on, Rebel Trooper add on, and Royal Guard add on.

"improved" version of Descent 2.0, though, I still prefer Descent for some reason.

This game is AWESOME! No other way to put it.
We've played the base set campaign and the Twin Shadows campaing.
The Base set campaign was a lot better - due to the much longer campaign. You get more connected with your character and better learn to play it.

Dungeon crawling in the Star Wars universe! Great hero options and variety, a great campaign with plenty of replay value and the most fun I've ever had playing the evil overlord/ DM/ Morcar/ Zargon/ Emperor ever due to tactical options tailoring the components to ones preferred play style. 

Update: Now playable in coop thanks to App support. A perfect 10 ever since!

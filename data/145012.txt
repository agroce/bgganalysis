This is a light family Euro with nice art and components. There is a sense of satisfaction when you see the palace that you have built at the end. There is nothing new or innovative that the game brings, but the artwork and theme are pleasant.

 The gameplay is fair and I would play it again if asked, but I wouldn't seek it out myself.

RATING: 6
Good looking game.
I like the game play, its quick and simple.
I think if the game is played enough to learn the tiles this game will play its self, this is due to a lack of good choices, most turns have only one good choice.
Leaving you with a game that plays its self.
So this is better left to people who own a large number of games and will not play enough to remember the number of tile possibilities.

RATING: 6
A simple, Euro, tile-laying game where you are building up your own palace and each player has slightly different scoring rewards (and some may overlap and be the same).  The artwork is wonderful, IMO, and the game itself is a very light Euro that I think works as an introductory type game.  I'll play it more and my kids will like the theme and the game.

2014. 2-4p, 45 min. tile pl, set coll.

Others say: very light, family euro game.  Every player is working on their own palace, so the only interaction is from taking tiles from the middle that other players might want.  An early poor choice of tile placement can really hurt you later in the game, much like tile/wall placement mis-plays in Alhambra, which BTW has a similar theme.

The components and artwork of Sultaniya are amazing and very pleasant to play.  It's a luck tile drawing with simple mechanism.  Easy to learn and play.  Kids love to play it.  Comparing to Splendor, you may have different ways to build your gem stock.  Players compete aggressively to achieve the gem goals in the market.  But I found that I didn't have too much choices to select the tiles in Sultaniya to build.  Feeling a little bit restrictive and limited.  It's not a bad game and still nice to play with causal gamers.

Vous avez aimé Istanbul et Five tribes ( respectivement coup de cœur des bénévoles cet été et cet automne), et bien Sultanya, ça n'a rien à voir. Ah si, quand même. Ça se passe au pays des sultans, grosso modo, même époque. Deviendra-t-il le coup de cœur de cet hiver? Dans ce jeu, vous allez devoir construire un beauuu palais pour votre sultan préféré. Avec des belles colonnes, des jardins, des minarets. Éventuellement demander l'aide d'un génie qui pourrait passer par là (Véritables figurines de génies dans la boîte, fournis avec leur lampe !). C'est un jeu de pose de tuiles (qui construiront votre palais, vous l'aurez compris). Des règles simples, des parties sympathiques. une belle découverte.

Kicsit nehezen tudom besorolni a játékot. Ami biztos: kivételesen gyönyörű kivitelezés, szép grafika, az átlátszó dzsinnek pedig fenomenálisak. Kb 2 perces szabály, pörgős lapkalerakásos játékmenet, némi aszimmetriával megspékelve. 
Ez mind nagyon jól hangzik és egyáltalán nem is rossz a játék. Sokkal több van benne, mint elsőre látszik, de azért az az érzésem, hogy igen nagy a szerencse szerepe. Simán lehet, hogy fel sem jön olyan lapka, amiért te kapnál pontokat. Dzsinnek nagyon jó kombinációs lehetőségeket visznek a játékba, de azért minden lapkáért, nem lehet dzsinnt hívni, így egyértelműen előnybe kerül az, akinek a 3 vagy 6 pontos lapkái hamarabb előkerülnek. A pontozás is kicsit sánta nekem. Túlzottan hangsúlyosak a 6 pontos formák és a pontot érő tetőlapkák, így értelmetlenül háttérbe szorítják a többit, pl. a titkos célt, ami így kicsit értelmét veszti, mert milyen titkos cél az, amivel alig lehet pontot szerezni.
A szabály rettenetes, de némi netes keresgéléssel megérthető a szándéka. :)
Annyi rosszat írtam, pedig ez egy jó kis, egyszerű lapkalerakós játék, ami bárkinek tanítható, de mégis azért van benne bőven kombinációs lehetőség.

Sultaniya is a tile-laying, palace building game that is as much as a spatial puzzle as game. Straightforward gameplay with some lovely (if overproduced) components. Nothing totally mind-blowing however. The luck of the draw is very heavy here, and while it can be mitigated by spending jewels, you are mostly playing by revealing tiles and hoping for the best. Pleasant and not bad to play through. But not interesting enough to inspire me towards playing it again

RATING: 7
Pretty nice family game, slightly reminiscent of "Alhambra" in the theme and the tile-laying mechanic, but without the annoying money rules. There are balance issues and significant randomness, which make it not so good for a table full of gamers, but it's very pleasant to play. The production certainly helps with beautiful artwork, plastic sapphires that look like big diamonds, and fantastic djinn miniatures in translucent plastic coming out of golden lamps. One design decision I don't understand is why the two recommended four-player setups either include all female characters or none, when it would have been so easy to go for a more even split.

I wasn't really sure how I'd like the game after reading reviews on here, but I'm glad I took a chance on this one. The art and the components are great. You can see some but not all of the other players' objectives, and the scoring all happens at the end so it's a bit of a mystery how that's going to shake out. There's enough going on in the mechanics that it doesn't feel too  simple, but it's definitely not a heavy game either. A very pretty game on the table :) 
My gaming group has liked this one.

This will definitely appeal to people who like shiny, pretty things.  It has sparkly jewels and everything. 
Components aside, it's a tower-building tile game, not that different from Asara, except that the building is wider, so you have the concept of support. I tend to like this sort of game. The individual player goals could be more diversified but still work nicely. (1 play)

The game comes in a big box, has great artwork (from the tales of 1001 nights), wonderful plastic gems that look like crystal diamonds, 4 really good figures of genies and lots of tiles.

Pleasant enough game. The gems and djinnis are neat components, and the artwork is very good. I think that in a family setting, this game would work great. For me, it was just okay. I actually found myself more interested in the end game scoring more than playing the game, as it just plays like a slightly tweaked Carcassonne, which surprised me because I thought this seemed more like Alhambra at a glance. Still a decent game for families, but probably not something I'd play over other tile-laying games.

RATING: 7
Awesome, big sapphires! Has a puzzle-solving feel to it, with having to match the various elements of the palace which I like. However, in a two player game this can lead to feelings of dissatisfaction as about a third of the total tiles are removed from play, thus creating situations where no tile can fit. In the future, we will be throwing caution (and game balance, probably) to the wind and play with all tiles.

I look forward to future plays of this game and exploration of strategies. This game seems like it would lend itself well to expansions and new scoring objectives.

Having different scoring rules for different players, and secret goals on top of that, adds some much needed actual gameplay value. Regardless of that, the game seriously lacks interesting decisions and mostly just plays itself.

Pretty at first sight but quite soon the obvious UI flaws start to show: 
- Keeping track of other players' soldiers is impossible because the soldiers are almost invisible.
- No player aids for genie powers.
- Both the scoring track and the scoring tokens are very poorly designed.

Beautifully produced tile-layer. Not sure why I didn't like it more. Keep referring to the rules because I forget what the different colored genies do. Do not like how two of the secret goals directly conflict with each other, so you can play well and still not win because of it. Also, got stuck during my second game when I needed to find a matching tile, but there were none left. It would have taken me four or five turns tearing down my palace and rebuilding. Luckily (?) another player ended the game and put me out of my misery.

After two plays I give it 6.5.  Almost a 7 for me.  Not terribly deep and complicated, but my kids and I all enjoyed it very much.

Still overall a good gateway game for the tile-laying genre.

I love the theme of the game, the art and presentation are just beautiful and do a great job of drawing you into the game.

The Genie sculpts make sense for what they do, making it very easy to remember w/o referencing the rulebook during play.

I enjoy the variable scoring for each player, with any player mixup changing the value of the tiles in any given game.  Game play is very light and the time to play is short.  

Best used as a family game or as a "gateway" for those newer to the hobby.  Very grateful to have this one in my game library.  (Thanks Aaron.)

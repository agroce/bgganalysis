A light game... very nicely produced. Some simple game mechanics, but not very inspiring for me. Will continue to give this table time though, as there are clearly worse ways to spend time with the family.

An unusual combination of set collecting with a race game.  Players move wagons across the board from both sides.  Along the way they pick up contracts and goods of different colours.  Matching sets of contracts and  goods score points. Take ownership of one of the first four wagons to cross the board and score more points.  Money is earned from taking contracts and can be used to break the rules of movement or be converted into victory points at a 5:1 ratio.  

Somehow, these interlocking mechanisms seem to add up to less than the sum of their parts.  I found Strada Romana a pleasant enough game, but all the decisions it presents are pretty obvious. A wagon makes rapid progress? Take ownership of it. Blue contracts will earn you more gold than any other? Move a wagon so that you can take one.  And so on.

RATING: 6.5
If you have ever wondered what a filler really should be, than this is a good place to start.  Game play is very short.  Turns are likewise quick but will still elicit meaningful decisions from the players.  In short order the game will wrap up, scores will be calculated, and the winner crowned.  And before you know it, you're off to the next game.  Was your journey worthwhile?  Likely so.  You may not finish a game and say - oh let's play again.  But next time your looking to fill in 30 minutes with 4 players before switching tables for a main event, this one should pop to mind.

It has some unusual mechanics, and therefore it's a potentially interesting game. There's just something too abstract in it, and I felt it a little cold (but this could be due to the rulebook). This needs a replay or three to judge accurately.

I'm not really sure why I liked this simple game. Maybe it just was it's simplicity combined with the rather attractive tactical options presented to you every turn. The traffic jams you can create to mess others out of their resources are just great fun. So a simple family game with a rather large take that factor.

Simple & fast, both to learn and play, it makes a very good job in combining a nice theme, good materials and an original mechanic. Great graphics for a game whose regular mechanic is modified by a potential (and covered) chance to bet which adds some useful uncertainty on the final victor.

Good resource management based game with nice themed board. Played with three with mixed feedback. Overall a fairly light game but some good stratagy options. One gripe is the lack of event in the game. Many have complained about the "traffic jam" in the middle of the game but I found that we did not encounter much in the way of drama. My main gripe is the lack of detailed explanation and lay out of the rules. Some elements are just not covered and others that are vital to game play are just one line buried in the text.   Overall, a reasonable strategic game with a little "take that" element that would improve with more action choice.

First impression: Played with two. Not much decision, just set collecting and a little race betting. Hope for a better expierence with more players.

One play only, 2 players. I was attracted to this title because of the general idea (worming your way out of a prehistoric traffic jam), and my girlfriend because of the appearance, which she found very appealing and cute. Unfortunately, despite the rather elegant rules the promised traffic jam management never seemed to appear in our setup: it took ages for the merchants to meet head-on and by then the game was nearly over anyway. A second deception came in the form of the scoring: it proved altogether way too easy to pursue the optimum strategy, being collecting one contract of each colour, and then of one colour a lot of contracts. I've noticed that more people have found this issue in the 2P-game problematic, and that the author has even started work on a fix. I'm keeping my fingers crossed, for we didn't purchase this title because of the game's rather shoddy performance, and a good alternative might win us back over.

That said, I doubt a little that the traffic jam management actually plays a big role. With two players you make the same number of moves as with five players; it's just that with five players people are far more likely to be inclined to purchase a special move in order to grab a specific part of a contract, and thus [i]cause[/i] the jams to appear. There's also more points to be had in estimating the correct arrival of the merchants, I think. And to be honest, the alternative scoring variants proposed for the 2P-game so far make a lot more sense than what is currently in the game... Summarising: has a nice bit of potential, but needed to have been refined more.

[b]Update[/b] Many years later I purchased the game on the cheap, remembering that those variant rules might improve matters. As it turned out, however, the English rules weren't actually phrased all that well, and suggested things which more or less hammer a stake through the game. For example, you are [b]not[/b] allowed to pick up contract parts at the end of every movement in your turn. No, [i]per turn[/i] you can only take [b]one[/b] part of a contract (that is, in the 2- and 3-player case). Ahaaa... Lookee here. That changes matters, of course. And once you get that rule correct, and introduce a few of the variant rules (pair of completed contracts = 1 VP, stacking the square contract parts, at the very least; not sure about the start with 2 contract halves, or the handing out of 1 wagon tile) [i]and[/i] remember that it is 3 movement points or nothing, then all of a sudden Strada Romana turns into a fun little game with even a little asymmetric evaluation of player positions. Traffic jams appear too, because the wagons meet head on long before the contracts can be filled or money can be transformed into VP. And so money is actually spent on special moves too. Whoopdeedoo!

I'm actually feeling a little pleased that I gave the game another chance, and plan on introducing it to less serious gamers too. So, correspondingly, the rate has gone up considerably.

February 2012 -- We haven't had an occasion to play this again, but I think it's a very good game. I hope we will try it some more.

2013-November: Still haven't played this as much as I'd like, but have enjoyed it each time.

A nice and simple game that plays smoothly and easy. There's nothing remarkable to it apart from the beautiful graphics. Just an average and solid game of set collection.

I liked playing it and can play in the future if there's an opportunity. I won't seek it but I won't run away either :-)

When the game was explained to me during the Spiel in Essen, I was intrigued.  It seemed as though it would present lots of challenges, and collecting complete contracts would be quite difficult.  The betting aspect also seemed interesting.  However, in reality, it isn't all that difficult to collect complete contracts, and often most players don't lose any points for incomplete contracts.  The congestion that is a central element of the game actually has the effect of causing the game to decelerate, allowing boredom to creep in.  The game fails because it simply isn't that exciting or challenging.

RATING: 6
Neat and more or less fast game. Played it as a 2-player game and while the game itself was nice, it was kind of boring. With more ppl involved it would be better, BUT also more chaotic, which could make the gameplay worse.

If I were a spiteful person, my score would be dropped by a point due to the ass-tacular color choices... green/gold and brown/red are almost impossible for me to tell apart. The color-sighted were kind enough to position the pieces differently for each color so that I was able to play (gee... thanks!) but just a few minutes of research would have avoided this problem (and this goes for ALL games... find a color-blind player.... hell, call me and I'll be GLAD to help!... and just do your best to use colors that will be easy to distinguish for EVERYONE.../exit soapbox)/

Based on one play: You basically just move the horses around trying to get goods in order to get a good multiplier on your score. Others can see what color you are chasing but it is not in anyones interest to try and stop you, but mainly just chase another color. Since the horses come form both sides, they run into each other and get blocked, but it is not a huge concern as you can pay to move as you wish. You can pass to get one gold and then five gold turns into one point, but that is way too costly. You can also bet on which horses will make it to the other side (when four do, the game ends). Overall, it is quite dull with half the rules not even being used.

Action point allocation game set in ancient Rome with a few nice touches. Players control wagons moving from two different sides of the board through the use of three  moves each turn. At certain points wares and goods can be picked up and it is by combining matching colours of these items that leads to victory points being obtained and therein lies the game's first main area of strategy. The second relates to players predicting which of the wagons will be first to cross the city to the other side and this can become an area of much thought as routes become blocked by other wagons, thereby slowing down progress. This is a solid game with plenty of opportunity to interfere with opponents' plans but there isn't enough variety on offer to have players coming back for more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
In my opinion this game requires that players hide all of their resources (coins, victory points, goods, contracts) because at the end there is high risk of kingmaking side effect. Game flow is dynamic, due to different goals (set collection and race). Asymetric map should get players into challenge to master the race.

Oh how I love the concept of Strada Romana!  Two groups of chariots race toward each other and then smash together in the heart of the city.  Strada Romana straddles the line between too chaotic for heavy strategy, and too rulesy for light filler.  The resulting compromise just isn't that fun.  Instead of the inevitable collisions increasing the excitement, the game slows to a crawl, like a real traffic jam.  Oh good.

I don't understand how a game like this could get published given all of the potential designers out there vying for the limited number of spots available for new releases each year. It's completely insipid. Players take turns moving chariots through a bottleneck in the midst of a Roman traffic jam. You can "bet" on which chariot you think will finish the "race," and you can take wooden cubes in various colors to create sets and earn gold. You can use the gold to do "special" chariot moves, such as a sideways move... exciting! Your score is principally determined by multiplying the number of different color cubes you have by the number of cubes you have in the color that you have the most of. None of the players felt any connection whatsoever to what they were doing or engaged by the game in any way. It's an uninspired design that sadly had the table laughing at it rather than with it.

Just one play. Want to retry as soon as possible because it was the very first game and because all players used the same strategy: pick up goods of the same color.
So at the 3/4 of the game there where no goods left and all the carriages were jamed in the middle of the board.
And the jam is the most interesting part of the game !
We didn't take enought care of the race part of the game. And it is important cause there are some big points to make here.
That's we I want te replay, to test some other strategies.

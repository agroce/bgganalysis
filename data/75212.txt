Great game. A game of medium-heavy complexity but with fantastic and original mechanics. Rules are easy to learn and teach (and this is a hit for this kind of games), so that can be explained to new gamers rapidly. One of the best economical-business games ever created, that reflects perfectly vintners choices across the years.

Very strategic game about running a vinyard, making and selling whine. I love this game. It really feels like you setup and work on a business, pay the interest to the bank etc. First person to pay of his bank loans ends the game. Person who made the most money wins. Get this game! It is great.

Grand Cru is an economic game in which money is extremely tight; you start with none and your first action is to take out a loan with an eye watering interest rate.  Over-bid for a field of grapes or special ability and watch your finances dive into a death spiral.  As with many economic games, there are opportunities to manipulate the market and advantages to monopolies.  Once someone gets their engine running efficiently, the end of the game comes quickly.

Somehow, despite some interesting elements, Grand Cru didn't come together as a compelling game for me. I found it rather dry and procedural.  What you do after your engine is built is mostly just run it.  The theme resolutely failed to come to life.

The seventies pastiche artwork is quite a refreshing change, although the icons are badly done and we found a frequent need to check what the special action tiles could do.

Has some redeeming aspects as an economic game. The advertisement action is mostly useless or extremely powerful depending on offer. If one player plants pinot early with no competition due to tile distribution he will run away in the midgame.

I very much enjoy this game.  It is like a cross between Power Grid and Black Friday.  The only problem with the game is that though the art work is beautiful, it severely hinders the game play.  Pieces are easily lost in the background art, there is no consistent symbology, no reminders as to the order of year end events, and the art on the chits is nearly indistinguishable without a magnifying glass.  The mechanics are great, but it is hard to get through the imagery to get to the actual game.  This bothers me so much that I am working on different art and symbols for my own board and pieces to allow it to be played properly.

Players run vineyards.  Players obtain loans.  Money is tight.  Wise investments in vineyards and special tiles will help with the costs. The game ends when the first player is able to pay off all of his loans, which several dis at the same time.  Reasonably engaging game..

A Vinhos-t még nem próbáltam, de mindig egymáshoz hasonlítgatták ezt a két játékot, és ez az összehasonlítás nem volt túl kedvező a Grand Cru-ra nézve. Pedig jó játék!! Lehet, hogy a Vinhos még jobb, és tudom, hogy teljesen más kategória is. De az tuti, hogy a Grand Cruhoz szívesen leülök máskor is. Nagyon élvezetes. Tematikában én utoljára a Dominant Speciest éreztem ilyen eltaláltnak és egyedinek. Két hibát tudok mondani: A presztízspontok elköltése nagyon igaszságtalanra sikerült, mert az ülésrend felülírhatja a sorrendet, ha valaki mindig utolsó, de a jó helyen ül, akkor mindig másodikként választhat a presztízs akciók közül. A másik hiba, hogy nincs leszabályozva a játék hossza. Vagy akkor van vége, ha valaki visszafizet minden hitelt, vagy akkor, ha valaki csődbemegy. Tehát elvileg a végtelenségig is tarthat a játék!! Mi van pl. akkor, ha mindenki úgy érzi, neki a legjövedelmezőbb a birtoka, ezért bár temérdek pénze van mindenkinek, senki se fizeti vissza az utolsó hitelét, csak hogy nehogy vége legyen a játéknak? Ez így szerintem elég béna dolog, ezt leszámítva tetszik nagyon.

Egyszerű, könnyen befogadható szabályokkal megszerkesztett, szépen kivitelezett játék.
Azonban hiányzik belőle vmi., ami izgalmassá tenné.
Túl egysíkú és egy idő után statikussá válik. (csak rójuk és rójuk a köröket...)
Nehezen lendül át a játék a "holtponton", amikor már a hitelek visszafizetésére összpontosíthatunk.
Egyébként a témát jól visszaadja a játék...!
Megítélésem szerint az ideális játékosszám 5 fő... + na, meg egy üveg bor is kell hozzá, hogy legyen ami "életet" vigyen a játékba.

Unalmasnak mégsem mondanám, de azért nem egy "Chianti"...

The theme of wine making is the hotness of 2010, and it is a theme I like, so I bought Grand Cru (almost) blindly. It is a fine game, which works a little like Age of Steam: players take loans to start off, then plan their economies to pay back the loans at a certain point. It is a good game, where the most part of the players interaction is in the auction for vineyard tiles and improvements. As with the majority of these type of games, the flaw lies in the fact that players need to know how the evaluate the tiles (and that is not an easy task, due to a certain amount of opacity!), otherwise the system can fall apart.
Needs more plays for a more accurate evaluation.

This seems to be a fragile, economic game as good ol´ Container is one of. Don´t take out to much loans at the start. Take 6 loans and you will sure die the death of interests - and the greedy bank wins once again! (Which means all other players win, except you) For your first GC experience you can ease it with some house rule to pay 1 Franc less interest for the first two years. After that startup period, the full rate as usual has to been paid. 
Print out the gamers aid sheets here from BGG, i wonder why eggert didn´t lay four sheets in the box? With Cuba they did it better. With giveaway tiles: heuriger, mixed Set and the Innovations tiles.

Very impressed on first play and keen to play again. This is a complex gamers' game where you have to struggle to avoid bankruptcy and very reminiscent of a Wallace in that respect (only), which is a positive for me.  We found it well worth the effort and our game explored some of the different tactics on offer, given the different characteristics of the grape varieties, with a 'quick and cheap' strategy competing with an 'invest for the long term' and a more balanced approach.  Impressive that this has been incorporated in a nicely thematic way, which makes the game a bit easier to pick up as well as more enjoyable to play.

Grand Cru is a fragile game, and the three of us playing were terrible at it. It's only a six because I don't really know where it might end up. It might be fantastic, or it might be trade fodder. 

I know I spend a fair amount of time complaining about games that are so balanced that they appear to play themselves. Grand Cru was quite possibly the furthest from that end of the gaming spectrum that I've ventured (at least, it felt that way on the first play). Round length, game length, and game balance are all in the hands of the players. I enjoyed the game, despite having no idea what I was doing and coming in last by a large margin. The mechanics are easily digestible, the play is fast and smooth, and the level of interaction is on par with Puerto Rico. If I ever get really good at games like Grand Cru, Grand Cru seems like it would be a very highly rated example of the genre. 

At the same time, I do have concerns about a few things, most notably left-right binding (we played 3-player and the binding reminded me a lot of my first play of Loot, also 3-player). I also really fear that without a group committed to learning and playing the game, it will regularly devolve into a game that's only as good as the weakest player. One play is obviously just one play, so take all of this with a rather large grain of salt. 

Updates: Traded after three plays.  The whole system is a little too loose in the joints (aka fragile) for me to make the most of the potential that the game offered.

Just as Wabash CannonBall is all about controlling the intersection of game-length and personal posture, Grand Cru is all about the time-value of money versus controlling round-length (iterated). It is the heart of the game, and yes, of course it is explicitly unfair. It wouldn't be interesting if it were fair.

RATING: 6
The game itself is fairly straightforward and reminds me in no small extent of Age Of Steam. Players start the game with no funds, and must take out loans from the bank to get going. Banks expect to be paid interest over such a request, and if you could make sure you haul your ass off to pay them the money back then thank you kindly. Which is what happens in Grand Cru. Players go into debt, build up a sort-of economy to make money, and continue to do so until one player manages to pay off his debts, thus heralding the end of the game. A quick inventory of liquid assets, vineries and wine in production then determines the winner.

Sounds simple in theory, but in practice... I'm not sure. Money is tight, and the interest rate brutal, meaning that you cannot afford to make a single mistake in valuing the vineyard tiles or timing your actions. This process begins right at the beginning of the game: be lax here, and you lose. Even something as inconspicuous as a grape tile has an intrinsic value a player must be aware of. The most glaring example: in the two full post-Spiel games I played to date, the winner relied very strongly on one or two types of action tile (the double harvests), which when coupled to a [i]yellow[/i] grape tile are [i]insanely[/i] powerful if not recognised in time. You get to conserve actions; two yellow grapes sell easily for about the interest on the lower end of the scale; two grapes sold at a time others are struggling with just one means you get a lot of prestige which you can use to boost both the yellow price and becoming starting player; and basically you get to flip the bird to the other players. The only countermeasures are to prevent someone from obtaining that combination; or to cash in on the yellow production too; or to drive up the inherent price of a yellow tile simply because it is worth quite a lot at the [i]beginning[/i] of the game, paradoxical as that may sound.

Grand Cru is a title where you cannot really play your own game. The game, in as much as you can speak of one then, is in learning the correct countermeasure in a lot of situations: make a mistake, you effectively lose money, and let someone else slip away. This is doubly important in the beginning, because tiles you buy here will stay with you the longest. If the group you play the game with is composed of regulars with whom you'll learn Grand Cru together, then the effort might be (somewhat) worthwhile. For casual play I'm beginning to fear this game is probably not worth the effort. The sheer brutalness of how the game plays out acts as a deterrent for such groups: once you begin losing, you lose [i]bigtime[/i] in a nasty, spiralling-out-of-control way without hope for redemption, and that is not a great motivator to try it anew. The game would go over much, [i]much[/i] better if there were some rule change or variant to ease newcomers into the rythm of the game, allowing them to make a few mistakes without too great consequences, and to entice them into slowly tightening the thumbscrews. Right now the game's ruleset is one for expert players, and for that the game gets 1 point deduction.

Several incidents during the game I wondered to myself, "Why aren't we playing Age of Steam rather than this?". That said I do like the game and will play again. I am glad they used cubes rather than bunches of grapes for bits. Clear markers over the wine selling cost would have been helpful. It is important to buy special tiles. Grapes will always be for sale later, but first build infrastructure then make money.

A surprisingly tight and interactive game. Because the year ends after 4 rounds and someone has harvested all of his grape vines, all the players need to keep on eye on who's harvesting what.  Also, the price of wine drops after someone makes a sale. Then there's the bidding for grape vines and special tiles. 

Made the house rule that you have to wait till a subsequent round to buy a tile even when you bid $7 and you can have only one tile of a tech type.  Game play was much tighter.

[ImageID=858625]

Grand Cru is a hard game for me to really rate, despite already being three plays into my exploration of the game. The game is thematically about the managing of a wine business, but in reality it ends up mostly being about return on the managing debt, and being able to position oneself to eliminate that debt at a point in time where your post-game cash in is such that you will beat the competition. In our game that simply seemed to come down to who was able to get a maximal revenue stream fastest and then turn that momentum into the ability to pay down their loans.

Even if that was all there was to the game, I suspect the layers of decision making that would engender would be sufficient to make this an interesting game worth exploring for a handful of plays at least. I suspect, however, that the game we played was not a true representation of what this game has to offer and instead was representative of the petty struggles of individuals who really only had the vaguest ideas of what was going on, and probably won’t understand until even more plays have been reached. I accept this, but I am not sure, how open other people are going to be to do dealing with an opaque system that has the potential to fly wildly out of control in the hands of rank amateurs, in a manner similar to how Container can be extremely fragile and very vulnerable to unartful player decisions.

Elsőre nem rossz: gyors pörgős körök, igaz mivel 1 évben (fordulóban) több is, ezért nem rövid játék, de nem is elvetemült hosszú.
Jól egymásba rakott, egyszerű szabályú, de mégsem családi játék, vagyis valahol a családi és a gamers gém közt.
Sok mindenre kell figyelni, apró részletek, és a másik figyelése sem árt: évet jókor, jól kell tudni befejezni. 
A bor készítés: szőlők vásárlása, szüret, egyéb dolgok beszerzése (minőségi bor készítés, plusz szüretelő, stb), ezek segítségével aztán jó bor készítése, és azok eladása a nagyobb haszon reményében, amiből aztán a felvett hitelt vissza lehet fizetni. S ha ez sikerül, akkor vége a játéknak. (Vagy ha végképp nem sikerül, és csődbe megy a birtok.)
Szép a játék maga, jól is van összerakva, sok újdonság azért nincs benne, olyan mint a Fresco ilyen téren. 
Még plusz előny, h 5 személyes, na meg a pörgősség: tényleg nem az van, h egy vki órákat van: az éven /fordulón/ belül, az egyes körök gyorsan zajlanak, hamar vissza kerül hozzád a "lépés".
Ugyanakkor meg kellemes, gondolkodtatós, tervezős játék.
A játék inkább 8. mint 7, sőt akár nőhet is felfelé.

What pulls me in here is tension of how tight everything is and trying to get as much done as possible before somebody triggers the end of the round. The auction is unique in how it's an action to claim your prize and how you can outright purchase something. The challenge is in getting just the right combination of bonus powers with fields, and I love the early part of the game where you're anxious to get development tiles and have to decide to outright purchase something or not. Since money is so tight, the evaluation between an action vs even a few dollars is not as easy as you might expect.

My concern is that the short game seems to be the way to go. That is, you purchase 1 development tile and maybe 2 fields and that's it. You start with 3 loans and run with those 3 acquisitions and pay back your loans while other players are still trying to get their bigger engines revved up. What should be a strategic game of clever bonus power combinations and astute bidding ends up be undermined by the player who takes out the fewest loans and buys 0 or only 1 bonus tile.

RATING: 6
Grand Cru starts by players taking out loans. Interest rates on those loans are insanely high so this sets the tone for the first phase of the game, the struggle to scrape the interest together each turn. Players slowly build up their engines, hoping to gain a miniscule advantage over the competition. At some point the scales start to tip and cash starts flowing in, signalling that the game will be over in a very short while.

The transition from cash-strapped to debt-free is rather abrupt, and the biggest part of the game is the uphill battle to enhance your vineyards while still being able to pay interest on your loans. As might be expected, that is a rather dry affair in spite of the theme. Progress initially is barely noticeable and Euro-perfect calculation is important. People who like their games dry, tense and on the brink of destruction will find a lot to like here.

Update: My second play left me less than impressed. If the game comes down simply to who manages to acquire the best combo (be it degenerate or not) in the first two or three turns that would be a major letdown. Downgrading from the initial 7 for now.

Top on my list of economic games.  True of many economic games but NOT TRUE with Grand Cru; Having your own strategy is not required to do well, just tactics to defeat the strategies of the players adjacent to you in turn order.  Have only a few plays thus far and it has been great to have an economic game where your success is largely attributed to your strategy and the tactics to execute it.  Simply playing against the adjacent players has resulted in last place in my games of Grand Cru.

I was very impressed with my first play, but further play has raised possible balance concerns. Specifically: I'm not sure whether the slower-maturing grapes are viable with a group that knows what it's doing ... but I could be wrong.

What I especially like about Grand Cru is the turn structure, and the fascinating (sometimes coercive) timing decisions it generates. The bidding for resources is interleaved with various other actions, with too little time to do everything you need to do. Auction prices are highly volatile depending on where players' attention is focused at any given time. The upshot is that evaluating the worth of resources, actions, and time is extremely tricky.

I've played the prototype twice and once the final game. The gameplay is tight. It seems that extreme strategies are more rewarded than balanced ones. I am not yet sure if I like that aspect of the game. You really have to keep an eye on what are your fellow players doing. The mechanics are nicely interwoven. But while you choose your strategy in the first rounds, beginning with the mid-game you only execute what you planned, barely a meaningful decision is needed later, which lowers a bit my enthusiasm. Also the "direct buy" somehow avoids the auction and is saving one action compared to it; therefore it seems too strong, even if you pay two or three francs more than in the auction; it the actions that are scarce.

Pretty good economic game.  I'd definitely play again.  I liked the track to age your wines.  It let you plan your stock bids to try and plan what would be sellable, when, and for how much.  There are quite a few things to consider during play, bids, demand prices, age of wines, technology, debt, etc.  All make for an interesting balancing act.  The downside is it doesn't feel terribly interactive, even with the bidding and spending of "prestige" for final actions each round.

This is an excellent economic game!!! What a gem!!

You're in charge of your vineyard and you have to harvest your grapes to make wine in order to sell it, to earn money, so you can pay off the loans that you took  out as you started this business. Sounds easy, right??? 

Well first of all, everyone will try to get the grapes for the right wines. Prices go up, as people bid up. You can't have it all. But you need help in the form of "helper tiles". Those can be expensive, but they are very useful as they cut your costs down. Harvest all you can, because making wine is important. Why? Because you need to make money. And money is how you obtain additional tiles for grapes and "helper tiles". 

As you sell the wine at the festival, you get action points, which you can later turn into additional sales, juice, value of wine or money. So you have to compete at the festival level as well. Once you're done there, you have to pay interest on your loans, but make sure you have enough money, otherwise, you'll have to take out another loan! And you need to pay off your loans, not take more of them!! 

Very tight economic game. Plenty of things to do, very enjoyable, fierce fight and making sure you wine is the best of the best. Very recommendable game!!

A reasonable business game (ignore the vinyard idea, it could have been themed around anything that increases in value with age, such as antiques) where you're short of actions rather than money. There's a strong groupthink element to how much time you have for each round and how much the tiles are worth so playing time can extend well beyond the 90 minutes advertised. I'm not sure there's much mileage in a low loan, few actions strategy so there's a bit less in the game than meets the eye.

I've enjoyed this game far more than I expected I would. Unlike most engine-building games, in Grand Cru you don't build up an engine and then run it for awhile. Instead, you build up an engine, prove it works, and then the game basically stops. Excellent dynamic combination of a handful of mechanisms. Gives the feel of building a wine "start-up company". It can drag, however, with a particular kind of poor play by even one player.

Very good, tight, economic game.

It's not love at first sight for many (me too), BUT starting with the 2nd play - when you have grasped the game already, its flow, dynamics and subtleties -  it becomes great: full of tension, predicting others' moves, with ever-present race in several aspects...  Sometimes it feels like chess in the most positive meaning of this word.

EDIT: Wow, with more plays it becomes better and better.. different valid strategies and all mechanisms mesh together wonderfully...

EDIT2: After 9 plays I have enough.  No specific complaints.  The game has just worn out for me.  Pity, because I have pleasant memories connected with it :(

The theme is good. The individual parts are ok (vineyard, barrels, market...) but all together does not work together as good as it should:
- in the auction house, it's better to buy than to bid because it costs 'actions'. While you bet others are executing actions in their vineyard, selling wine etc.
- A interest rate of 20% is not reasonable. You spent almost all money on paying interests and the credits.

After 2 hours, I think we have been in the middle of the game, so we stopped it unfinished.

RATING: 8
An underrated game of steering start-up debt into a sustainable revenue stream in order to reach into the black with the best ROI. Along the way auctions reign-in leaders, competitive specializations are acquired, various vintages are harvested and matured, wine demand is manipulated, and prestige actions are fought over. 

A mildly opaque affair where timing is key. Do you play for a short turn-around or invest for the long haul? Because of this decisions often have ramifications beyond the current year. In the end timing, balance, and length are all within the hands of the players.

RATING: 7
Our second game went much faster with less of a struggle to get out of debt. But the concern regarding the four-action-strategy grew as one player implemented it well and we found no way to counter it. Grand Cru definitely needs experienced players to shine. I hope that it doesn't get a constant battle to fight this strategy. Why does the vineyard have 12 spots when the winning strategy only demands 4 or maximum 5?
---
Grand Cru starts with the same premise as Age of Steam. Players begin with nothing, have to take out a loan and from thereon the unforgiving struggle to get out of debt starts. Contrary to Age of Steam, in the middle of the game the fear of a never-ending game set in as we all just were able to pay interest, occasionally had to take a new loan, were able to avoid bankruptcy but nowhere came close to paying back the loans. This might be due to our inexperience and mediocre strategies. In the end, three of us were able to pay off all debt in the same round. 
If every game has this long walk in the middle of nowhere or - more severe - if the minimalistic fun-killing four-action-strategy proves to be superior, Grand Cru will go down the drain. Until then, it's a good game for hardcore economic gamers that's worth exploring. Don't let the negative buzz especially in German forums turn you off.
The board artwork serves its purpose but is rather ugly. The artwork on the special tiles is not functional. They all look alike and even in my own vineyard I wasn't sure which tile has which function without looking it up. They also tend to visually disappear when lying on the gameboard. As usual, the artwork of Eggertspiele doesn't score with me.

Five (!) mistakes on first play to remember (should I start teaching games just by reading out the rulebook?):
- Tiebreaker on prestige is turn order starting left from the start player, i.e. start player is last
- Direct purchase is possible even for tiles currently auctioned
- Harvesting the last grape is only possible when the round marker already is on the fourth spot
- When there are not enough grapes to refill all vineyards, players get 1 Franc as compensation for each grape they don't get
- Good vintage: price doesn't decrease when a player sells a cube for maximum price

Didn't blow my socks off on the first play, but I rather liked it. Clearly a combo-building and timing game (both elements that I like). The timing element is the decision to end the turn (at what point do other players start to make marginal gains over your). The combo element is trying to build a production machinery (mainly with the special tiles) that can get more done in the same time than the other players'.

The main potential problem I see with the game is the turn order. I suspect it should not be clockwise from the start player, but determined dynamically. Right now there's too much left-right binding: the penalty for finishing the round is that you get one fewer action than the players before you in turn order. If the player to your right is playing a fast tempo game, you can only gain that action advantage by being the start player. This makes taking the start player token a no-brainer for the player with the prestige lead.

It is an interesting game with very specific mechanics. First of all, taking loans to get the starting money. Next an opportunity to take another loan or pay it back in order to pay less interest. Also the variable number of turns in a year - the players themselves decide when the year ends. And the most important thing is to finish the game on time by paying out all the loans. And don't complain that the game was finished just right after it was started. I think, such was the aim of the designers.

Įdomus žaidimas su labai specifine mechanika. Visų pirma, pinigų žaidimo pradžioje gavimas imant paskolas. Galimybė, paimti daugiau paskolų arba jas atiduoti ir mokėti mažesnes palūkanas. Taip pat nefiksuotas ėjimų skaičius vienuose metuose - žaidėjai patys nusprendžia, kada metai pasibaigia. Na ir svarbiausia - laiku pabaigti žaidimą atiduodant visas paskolas. Ir neimkite į galvą, kad žaidimas pasibaigė net neprasidėjęs. Toks, manau, buvo žaidimo kūrėjų tikslas.

Overly long game that ends really fast when it starts ending. The market is broken, it  doesn't work. You're boosting prices for other players' good and the way of upping the prices seems really odd. The game doesn't actually evolve that much around wine. Instead, you're benefiting the most when preferring different bonus tiles over wine tiles. The starting player position's changing between the players also doesn't work that well. It's a bit too easy and cheap to keep the position for long periods of time. The loan system is quite nice as well as the problem posed for the players by the maturing of wines. The game is also pleasant to the eyes and in a slight way reminds me of Puerto Rico thanks to the settler phase like tile buying and goods/wines of differing values.

Some nice ideas here (end of the year -trigger for example) and economic is very tight which I REALLY like. BUT otherwise Grand Cru is far from perfect game. First of all the game takes too much time which is always bad thing. But for me the most annoying feature is that even the most straightforward moves takes couple of actions and between those actions you might have to wait other players moves/AP issues -> gameflow is too slow. And I think the endgame scoring is a bit absurd too - yes, it's easy to remember to collect different kind of tiles, but I don't see how that thing fits to the theme? The game experience here is something which one I would like to like more, but the flaws are too big ones -> means that I'm quite sure, that I don't need to play this any more...

In spite of Drakkenstrike's review warning against playing [i]Grand Cru[/i] as a two-player game, my wife and I have enjoyed it quite a lot. Having only one action per round means it plays fast (even when pausing to consider your next action). There's a good degree of interaction in and competition over the auction, the festival, and the pricing. And you really have to watch the other player's position as much as your own.

Played twice, one with 3 players the other with 5 players. The gameplay is much better with 5 players as you can't concentrate on 1 particular type of grapes and not letting others to get some benefit. Steep learning curve, but well worth the effort.
edited on 5/12/2010: not sure I like this game as much as before as today's game drags so long (probably would end > 3 hours, and I have to call an end before that) and I'm sure I'm not the one who's hoping the game could end earlier. Am I playing with another game? Would try later with my familiar colleagues. Rating dropped to 7.

Four games later a number of frustrations has overtaken us, and if I wrote a review I would have to label the game as a "primeur" itself, since I think it should have been developed a bit further before its release.

A bad experience is not remedied by knowing I only have myself to blame.

Interesting game where you are taking loans out throughout the whole game to try and turn a profit on your wine.  You also have to wait a set amount of turns before selling your wine so there is a loan and gamble depending on how long you want to wait for your grapes to get more expensive.  Somehow I managed to win my first game which always makes it better, but I really did enjoy this game.  Worker placement with a bit of money management going on.

the game has an interesting mechanism, actions include a maximum of five auctions, where everyone on each of his/her turn decides whether to do some other action, or start, continue or end participation in one of the auctions. the auction has princes of florence princess and muse mechanism except it is possible not to take the item when the turn comes back. but do some other action instead. another borrowed mechanism is age of steam like loans. all in all, not a bad game, but I am not sure it offers enough interesting decisions. rating may go either way with further play.

A way too long engine building game with heavy emphasis on the special power tiles.

The price table does not work at all. First of all, they have not even tried to tie it to the theme; Raising the price is just an action, and that's it. Also, if you don't have the special power tiles giving you more than one price increase per action, taking the price action usually benefits your opponents only, and you just threw a perfectly good action down the drain.

The clockwise turn order does not work either. The price for the first player marker is too low, and it is too easy to keep that marker for several rounds in a row.

The graphical design is mediocre:
The game looks very bland, the price markers are too big for the price table, and some of the special power tiles are hard to decipher without the manual.

Rating based on one play only to take with a large dose of salt, not just a grain.

There is a brilliant game in here struggling to get out, but one play is not enough to determine whether a) it's not out because the game wasn't developed enough, or b) we don't understand the game well enough to let it shine.

Clearly a very fragile design, regardless - money is very tight and the interaction between players is huge. Early rounds are not that interesting because there is so little to do / sell, but mid-game things start to get moving. I am concerned that having an expansive winery is a waste, though - typically the player with the smallest number of wines to harvest will dictate the game's pace and if you're too far outside that level you're not likely to get much use out of your holdings...

RATING: 6
What seems to be a nicely put together Euro unfortunately seems to play the same on each playing. Specialise in one colour so as to minimise your sale actions, ram the price up, sell for max dollars.  Repeat for turn after turn until your loans are paid off. Specialisation allows you to win that colour each turn and give you the prestige points to get bonus actions. Diversification just can't compete, requiring more actions and getting less prestige. I originally liked that the engine building sub-mech for getting new tiles is different. Basically spend 1 action and pay 7 to get it straight away guaranteed, or put it up for sale at a low price, hope that no one overbids you and get it cheap when it gets back to your turn for the 2 actions (put up, then take). The risk is that someone overbids you however, and bang, that's an action wasted - you'll need to spend another action bidding again, or let it go for something else. This can be horrible if you've misjudged what other people want, or there are malicious players at the table, as every action feels like it counts. But the main issue is if you get overbid 3 or 4 times at the start of the game, you're effectively a full turn behind those who weren't overbid, and it's near impossible to catch up given there's little other interaction with a player once they have their money engine up and going. I like how it's moved on from the normal Euro spin of a set number of rounds and turns. We have an Age Of Steam get loans aspect at the start of each turn, and these will handle probable purchases and pay off loan interest. So you need to quickly come up with a means of getting revenue > interest. And in another interesting spin, the game ends when one player pays off all their loans. Then everyone pays off what they can, gets bonus money for diversification of tiles (which is easy enough to do near the end of the game after your specialisation engine gets you the money you need) and most money wins. You want to jump all over the improvement tiles which generally allow you to save actions each round. A round is made up of actions where people put up/bid for new tiles (which auto-generate wine cubes each turn), harvest wines, push up prices, sell wines and the like, and ends when someone harvests their last wine. So you need to keep roughly in step with the other players, never needing more than one action more than the player who'll need the least number of actions this turn - that's why those improvement tiles are so good.  There's some harshness, and it's probably hard to catch a leader as there's little interaction other than the bidding and in getting first sales of a cube colour to get best price. It's still just pushing cubes around, but the loan/interest engine building nature makes it interesting. Unfortunately, the kingmaking nature of the tile bidding, and the sameness of each turn, plus the sameness from game to game, drops it for me.

Nem igazán tudok sok értelmeset mondani róla. Minden megvan benne amitől szeretni lehet a társasokat, de valahogy nem működik olajozottan. Elsőként a licit, ami nagyon fura, mert gyakorlatilag egy pénzekéért lehet elvinni a cuccokat, mert nem éri meg felüllicitálni sokszor, ebből pedig kellemes feszültség születhetne. A többi része már viszonylag jól működik, de az kiveszi a játék élét. Ja és a szimbólumok, szépek bár, botrányosa összemosódnak, nehezen láthatóak.
Kellene játszani vele még, hogy korrekt legyen az értékelés.:)

Not good with two, but interesting with three or four. The game can be over quite suddenly with a runaway winner if the other players don't know how to stop that. (Basically, never let any player get a monopoly on one kind of wine.)

If you get a German edition and you don't read German, be careful: we've found some mistakes in some of the English-language player aids.

Economic simulation of wine growing in France. Vegas Showdown-like auctions enable a good 2p experience. Money is tight, the system is balanced, and the artwork is great. Great theme integration (with wine maturing each year, for example) and a good game progression that makes the time fly by.

I liked this one.  But then again, I saw the slow development necessary to get out of the starting debt.  It is wine after all and a good wine should take time.  Not that complex of a game at all, and shouldn't really require too much thinking on one's turn.  The first game might seem to run long, but with familiarity, the pace is increased and the game plays at a quick clip.  Adding to the appeal - the theme also works very nicely for me.

Juego economico con tema vinicola de fondo. La base del juego es una subasta sobre losetas de viñedos que producen vino que se vende al mercado, y de losetas de mejoras, que son pequeñas opciones a variantes de reglas que dan ventaja en algunas acciones. Necesita una partida para asimilar la importancia y variedad de estas ultimas. Secillo, corto y profundo pero sin agobiar.

Hay muchos juegos con temática de vinos... Pero ninguno me ha llamado tanto como este. Nada de mini-juegos y mecánicas retorcidas como el Vinhos. Grand Cru no tienen grandes pretensiones, y esa es su virtud. Un juego elegante y que no tiene unas reglas excesivamente complejas, pero difícil de dominar y ganar. Un buen ejemplo de juego Económico bueno.

Very fast and intense Economic style Euro with nice components, theme and mechanisms.
The market mechanism reminds me Planet Steam (in a simpler version) and I found very interesting the fact that the number of actions per turn depends on the players and are not predetermined.

Edit! All the above apply only for a 3 players game!
With 5 players some mechanisms do not work properly.

RATING: 7
This is one of those games that I enjoy more than the people I'm playing with do. I've never seen any malicious play or kingmaking in a game. Being overbid may seem harsh, but the bidding track has values from 1-7 and those who continually put tiles up for 1 (when others are paying more), are taking a big risk of losing an action and being overbid. It should really come as no surprise when they are outbid. Defending a grape type monopoly by overbidding is also a completely appropriate move in my opinion - the player doing so just has to factor in whether the cost of using their actions to do so is worth it. I enjoy all the subtle nuances and how well they play out. This is not a game suited to those looking for a solo gaming experience. Players need to check each others moves by breaking up monopolies and yet keep their own game on track. It is in this way that diversification is encouraged and games play out differently. Players who play in a boring, set way may indeed find the game boring, but what works in one game might not work in the next. A sign of a good game.

Perhaps the game runs a too long and starts a little slow. I suspect that the more experienced gamers become this will knock several turns off the gaming time as they become more efficient - beginners will probably dig themselves into a slow start. I find it an interesting puzzle getting out of this debt you've dug yourself into - much like the economy of many a nation. If tiles go for high prices at the beginning of the game it'll significantly increase the play time. As the game develops the turns become longer. Missing the opportunity to end the game by not picking up a franc or two can lead to an extra turn and another 30 minutes of play time.

I enjoy the relationship of the improvement tiles and wine varieties, then in the second stage the improvement actions bought with prestige. It has a unique feel this game and that's appealing to me when it works. Grand Cru doesn't bog down in money counting like Automobile. Unlike Black Friday it has a discernible theme that matches the game play. The rules are quite straight forward. Once you work out the artwork with their trucks and snipping grapes has meaning it becomes easier to follow. I think this is the weak part of the game - more clarity with the artwork would make it easier for beginners to pick up.

Unfortunately I seem to be one of the few who likes it, but that's okay. For an economic game it's one of the better ones.

Before playing, Robb Effinger was talking about how he was afraid there was a dominant strategy. Having not learned the game, I did not really know what he was talking about. In my game of Grand Cru, I looked at my strategy and realized "oh, this is what he meant!"

My opponents were both looking to cash in on some expensive blue and purple crops which they'd invested heavily in. I on the other hand had only yellow grapes and nothing else. I had taken fewer loans, and was making a modest income from my Yellow grapes, and just before David got a $28+ payoff from his Purples, I ended the game by paying off all my debts. I won the game 22-4-3 or something.

The thing is, I could see this happening all the time. Players who go bigger on loans trying to get more expensive grapes in play will simply lose when the cheap-grape player pays off his couple of loans. Maybe this just means that everyone needs to get some cheap grapes going to build up more slowly to the bigger grapes, which is fine. In retrospect I'd like to play this some more and see how people's strategies develop as they realize how this game works.

The wine theme is integrated in a fantastic way. The whole game is quite good, not only the auction mechanic (which was the main reason why I had bought it). 
There's a bit of a problem about the seating order though: if you sit next to the starting player or the most famous player (who goes first in phase 2), you have a considerable advantage! Sitting next to beginners is an advantage as well! 
The duration varies widely and one cannot easily say how many rounds will be played.

Not recommended with 2!

RATING: N/A
This is basically an auction game. Or it should be because that's the only interesting thing going on during the game. It has IMO lots of flaws: some special tiles are really special wile others are just ok. A certain combination of action tiles can be too powerful and maybe too obvious. If a player gets the 2 harvest and the 2 different sales actions I guess the game is his!
Still a cool auction (not that new but fun to play) and a great wooden box. The rest of the components is a bit off for the Eggert Spiele's standards but it's not bad.

A hard core and awesum economic game. Not a sim as this has NO thematic fidelity - the wine business is not like this, however the game is compelling and very tough. 

There seem to be loads of paths to progress and control your fortunes, and a large number of competing demands to balance. There is a real need to value the auctions correctly and to try and establish quasi monopolies, and to stop other players achieving them. One of the best games from Essen 2010

Very good game and I love the wine theme. This is not about actually building up your economic engine and then making tons of money. This is about getting just enough money to pay back your loans. If you focus too much on getting a big pay off at the end, someone else will (most likely) beat you to it and finish the game before you actually get the chance to cash in. The end game will happen very suddenly, so while of course optimizing your income you must keep an eye on the possibility that the game will end this round.

Many interesting decisions every round and the game doesn't drag on for hours. Even the auction goes smoothly, because if someone pays 7 francs, she gets the tile and that's it. So no boring auction rounds going around the table again and again and again. 

I actually got the "first times playing Puerto Rico" feeling about this game, because when it ends you feel like shouting "no wait, just one or two more turns and I'll have it all, nooooo" and you instantly want to play again trying a different strategy. Recommended if you like economy games and of course if you enjoy wine.

Somehow the game lacked fun and was more work than play. Rating after one play. The winner produced only one cheap type of wine and tried to end the game as fast as possible which was very successful. This left the other players unsatisfied with a low number of actions and turns.

I had high hopes for this one, and I may have given up on it too soon, but this seems to be a game that needs some further tweaking/development. The concept/theme is very nice, but the underlying mechanisms do not seem to work, or are at least not much fun. Currently a disappointment.

You bid on different varieties of grape fields (which vary in terms of how much money their wine can make and how long it may take to mature) and also on some special ability tiles, and aim to have the most money at game end. The game end is triggered by someone paying off all their debts. Soon thereafter the game ends, and some bonus money is received for a couple of things.

I'm not too pleased when a game's goal and its endgame trigger are so close but not quite the same. Not sure how annoying it is here.

There are tactical considerations I suppose in that the end of each "year" is player-controlled. Once someone has harvested the last of their grapes from their fields, the other players get one more move each and the year is over. So, a player who sets himself up with a lot of work to do (e.g. a lot of fields to harvest) may not have enough time to do it. There's a chance this could serve as a rubber-banding mechanism, as the player with the least to do sets the standard of how much can be done. I am not sure how much of the game is in these time-budgeting considerations, but they're not of much interest to me, and they seem to necessitate the micro-move format (i.e. you can do very little at one time before the next player goes).

And I typically feel like I want to do a number of specific things, but the order I do them doesn't matter, because most of them don't involve much player interaction. That creates an annoyingly loose feel, even though the economics of the game are very tight (huge interest payments on loans that you can't avoid taking).

The bidding on tiles has an interesting eBay-like system where there is a BIN price that gives you the tile with one turn, or else you can place bids and possibly win it for cheaper but for a minimum of two turns. The BIN price is always $7; it seems reasonable to think that this cannot always be a reasonable price (either too high or too low), but I don't have a feel for which side it errs on.

There's a majority sub-game where selling the most of a given type of wine each year gives you "points" which you can spend to do additional actions outside of the usual turn framework. This might be a rich-get-richer element. I mostly felt like it wasn't likely to work well because there may not be much competition (or [i]deliberate[/i] competition) for each type.

It's not a fiddly game at all and is easy to play, but it seems pretty opaque, as far as what good strategy or tactics would be.

Initial opinion is decidedly meh, but it could move up given variant rules that strip out some of the mechanisms and sharpen the focus.

Ronda de cuatro turnos. Puedes subastar variedades de uva, comprarla si eres el valor mas alto, vendimiar, vender vino maduro o subir el precio de una variedad. Al final del cuarto turno es la feria de fin de año, se pagan puntos de prestigio por acciones especiales y el vino que tengas envejece. Termina cuando un jugador cancela todos sus prestamos o llega al tope de prestamos. Gana el que mas dinero tenga. Muy lento, el turno en los puntos de prestigio es injusto y se puede eternizar la partida hasta que uno quiera terminar, porque el dinero es secreto

Grand Cru represents the best locations for a vintner to create and cultivate wine. But creating great wine and running a successful vineyard requires much more than just a great location. Patience, dedication and a good understanding of the market are all needed to be profitable.

As ambitious vintners, the players attempt to run new vineyards located at the best sites available. As with many new businesses, starting up is very difficult. For cultivation and operating of their new businesses, the players will need to rely on loans from the local bank. Money is tight and wise investments will also help with the costs of the business. There is a need to observe the cellar and balance long-term strategies against short-term interests for running a successful vineyard. Far-sighted planning and skillful timing are keys to success.

The game ends when the first player is able to pay off all of his loans. Only then do the players find out which vintner has the most profitable vineyard to win the game. A votre santé!

I am very thoroughly sick of games where you have to go through an agonizing number of turns just to start doing something interesting. This is yet another such game. I am actually trusting that there IS an interesting part, since in the game I played we didn't get to it, as it is possible to end the game very early on, and this was done. I regard this as a major flaw.

The rules translation initially proved to be a bit of a stumbling block and the iconography on the special actions spots could use some help, but the game was interesting once we figured out what we were doing.  Timing was crazy important for having wine mature, as was having multiple vines in barrels to sell.  

Special Note:  I normally stick to whole number value ranking for games, but I felt the inclusion of a glamour shot of the designer in the rule book deserved a head nod and a bit of a ratings bump!

After lowering my initial marks as a business game I've since raised them again on the merits of a "gamer's game".  Similar to Vinhos and perhaps a bit lighter. It's a solid Euro.  I'm still at a loss for being able to put together any kind of strategy to follow.  Have played more, and found there is depth to the game.  Often buying a tile out-right rather than bidding it up is the way to go.  Specialization in higher value wines seemed to give me a win in one game where I didn't have to compete much in that variety.

This is a very enjoyable economical game. It is also quite ruthless. While the game rules speaks of auctions, that's not really what's going on in the game fiction. It's more like trying to strike business deals, but being shot down, or not able to close them in time. Between players, the "auction" is more like a leverage tool, a way to put pressure on the other players, such as, "if you don't end the year now, I'll get this tile for a pittance."

If you and your group don't mind a game where tempers may flare, and people certainly will do their best to screw over each other, such as ensuring that you don't get that deal for that grapevine or equipment that you need so much, then this is a game for you.

I have the limited edition wooden box version, and treasure it.

Good pickup and deliver game.  Will have to play this a few more times to see what the best approach to this game is.  With the Cuban's and building being randomly assigned to slots, this game seems to have a lot of replay ability.

A decent, short(ish) Euro-game, with standard, familiar Rondel mechanics, and quite a high degree of take-that involved. Production is very attractive, and not distracting, which all adds to a moderately thematic experience, for a Euro. Not ground-breaking, but good stuff.

2012-05-17 (rating 6.5):

I played it once (with 3 players, 2 of them playing for the first time) and didn't like it much. Seems to simple. The goods aren't really converted, just used directly or in one step. There are only few choices each turn.

And the hidden information - I don't like that.

I hoped it will be more like [thing=3076][/thing] but it wasn't.

"Versión" reducida del Cuba, comparte misma estética pero mecánicas distintas, es más corto que el Cuba y más apto en general para menos jugones. El Cuba en si, es mejor juego, más largo pero un juegazo.

Probably one of the most straightforward resource management games. Each round players take turns to first gather resources and then turn them into victory points at the end of round. Game will be won by timing your actions correctly so that you are in the best position to score the biggest points and possibly deny others from scoring anything. For a resource management game Santiago de Cuba is so simple that it is hard to find any flaws in it. On the other hand, since there are no unpolished edges to the game, it is not too exciting either. An average cube pusher I would say. A big plus for the Cuban theme nonetheless.

I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Santiago de Cuba is a nice, relatively portable euro-game with some good mechanisms that doesn't outstay its welcome. As far as visual presentation is concerned, I'm always a fan of Michael Menzel's work and this board is no exception. It's a beautiful piece of artwork covered in bright vivid colors and lots of details that bring everything to life.

While the art is such a strong point in favor of this game, I unfortunately can't really say the same about its game-play. To be clear: It's not bad by any mean... but at the same time it's nothing to write home about. There's a lot of other euro-style games with similar mechanisms and a similar feel. Sure Santiago de Cuba offers a fair amount of depth and even a decent re-playability thanks to the random set-up of the action and building tiles, but I don't really find a reason to go back to it.

It's a well designed game and a perfectly put together package, but it doesn't have the most important this for me in a board-game: that twist that makes it stand out. Therefore I find Santiago de Cuba to be just a very average game in its genre.

немного похожа на "Токайдо", ты занимаешь определённое место, а на него уже нельзя встать (можно прыгнуть вперёд, но за деньги, и пропустив другие места). впрочем, основной геймплей при этом экономическо-погрузочный. 
очень сложно запомнить, у кого какие ресурсы есть, и можно прогореть на этом. 
BGG рекомендует играть на двоих, хотя конкуренция за посадочные места и здания (да и сами ресурсы) ощутимо ослабляется. 
большая вариативность игры от партии к партии за счёт случайного расположения как кубинцев, так и зданий.
"Князья Катана", по-моему, лучше. 

копия игры досталась сразу с несколькими видами брака: три пары одинаковых кубинцев (из девяти), четыре пары одинаковых зданий (из двенадцати), куча одинаковых жетонов очков (только 1,2 и 3, тогда как должны быть ещё 5 и 10). 
неудобные маленькие ширмы. милые иллюстрации Менцеля.

после второй партии:
атмосферная, но вялая игра. могут неудачно выпасть здания/кубинцы, и процесс будет довольно монотонный. очень сложно что-то просчитать даже на несколько действий вперёд.

Characters and a task (loading ships) familiar from Cuba, a rondel and a touch of worker placement.  Santiago de Cuba is a reasonable assemblage of parts previously seen elsewhere.  Indeed, it does a good job of distilling down some key elements of Cuba into a quick, easy game.  Random placement of the characters gives the impression of variability, though I'm not sure it changes the game in any significant way. With four players I found Santiago rather chaotic and would expect to appreciate it more with fewer.

Menzel's Cuban artwork is as easy on the eye as ever. Production quality is good, although the tiny player shields are disappointing.

Good looking eurogame. Great artwork. The rules are simple and the game works well. Plays in about 45 minutes. Small amount of luck. There is enough player interaction mainly because the players use the same miniature (taxi) in order to move around the town. Its a good gateway eurogame.

A lot of traditional euro goodness packed into a small package here, this game features resources acquisitions, conversions, and timely shipping, along with buildings which provide for euro type actions.  It has a nice, relatively short playing time, and it flows fairly nicely as you drive the car around a circle of actions.

I think it lacks a bit of flair and excitement though in many of its actions.  The thrill, for me, was in shipping goods, a la Puerto Rico type mechanics, first, before others.  Beyond that, though, many of the actions in this game seemed, relatively modest in scope and thrills, which I do not fully begrudge the game, which necessarily has to balance and equalize the power of all the actions.  But I did have a sense of wanting more fireworks in the game so to speak.  Still, this is a good euro design.

Könnyed, viszonylag sokszor újrajátszhatónak tűnik. A játék lényege, hogy árukat szerzünk, és a kikötőben néha eladjuk azokat. Van egy standard árfolyam, ami 2 és 4 közt mozog árufajtától függetlenül (ill. van 1 fix áras áru). Van sok hasonló játék, ami ebben egyedi, az egyrészt a kereslet meghatározása: kockákkal, mindig a kereskedést kiváltó játékos dönti el, melyik árura nincs kereslet az adott körben. A másik újszerű dolog az akcióválasztásnál a lapkákon lévő akció összekapcsolása az épületek használatával. A játék akár nagyon gyorsan is véget érhet, de lassan játszva is max 1 óra. Egyik gondom, hogy nagyon kicsi a készlet (minden áruból pontosan 8 van), így simán nyomon követhető a többiek áruinak memorizálása nélkül is, hogy miből mennyi van a piacon. Így sok értelme nincs a paravánnak szerintem. A másik gond, hogy a kevés eladási lehetőség miatt erősen fennáll a királycsinálás lehetősége. Egyértelműnek tűnik, hogy az eladás (kiváltásának) időzétése a játék kulcskérdése.

RATING: 8
Very nice, fast and fun game.  It is a kind of double rondel mechanism, where you select a character in a rondel, which afterwards sends you to a building.  The combination character-building will be different each game.  The idea in the end is to produce and send different products to get VP.  The capacity of the ship is decided with dice in a nice way.  Once you know rules, it can be played in 30-40 minutes. 
2 player games become quite tactic since the position of the car can be more controlled, and also you know each others commodities.

This is Cuba's little brother: it mantains some aspects of the original (theme, artwork, some of the mechanics) but reduces them to a very essential, straightforward tactical game.
Santiago de Cuba can be very mean, especially when played with just 2 players: it can be played in a very nasty, obstructive way!
Anyway it is fast and quite pleasant to play: a good filler with pretty components!

After a few plays, it's a lot of fun. Lots of tactical choices. Plus it's beautiful!

Update: Still like it a lot, although I rarely win.

Update: the game plays long for what it is. We start the turn marker on #3 which helps mitigate this a bit. My wife rarely complains about any game, but says SdC is redundant for her. 

It really does not help much that the setup changes from game to game. I have to agree with her this time-it's redundant.

Reduced from 8 to 7.

It's a tactical game which is fun and fairly quick to play. You move the car one space along the road to the port, or more than one space if you want to pay to move the extra spaces. You then activate the citizen in the store where t he stopped. You then move your worker to one of the buildings in the neighborhood indicated by the worker and activate it. If the car stops at the port, the players take turns loading goods onto the ship for victory points until the ship is full and sails, or every player passes. The game ends when seven ships have sailed.

Very good little game, but I like to play it with 2 players, more players means less control. The main problem of Santiago de Cuba is that 7 ships seems to be too much, there is almost zero engine-building mechanics, so after the car gets 10 laps around the city the game starts to feel a little repetitive.

In any case is a good game for newbies who want to explore the eurogames universe and for play with the family.

Good game. This plays quickly with not too much downtime, there's a lot of tactics for how you play each turn depending on what the next player round is trying to do, and there's a fair variety of different actions to take.

RATING: 6
Popular in publishing circles these days is positioning a game in a ‘universe’. It allows a designer to re-use similar ideas or a similar subject without the need to call it an expansion of an already existing game. Santiago de Cuba takes place in the Cuba-universe; and does so to the point where the usage of the now-familiar Cuba-artwork is beginning to look like infamous expansion production to keep having interested people pay for essentially the same product.

The game itself is, in my opinion, probably the best of the entire series. It features the same grand ideas as Cuba, the same characters we've encountered up to Havana, but requires the players to interact in a different way. Now we walk around on a rondel with just one, shared pawn (and as usual moving further away costs money); the people action on which the pawn lands we take; and as an extra a building action with a colour equal to that of the character is carried out. At one point on the rondel it is possible to sell raw materials to a ship for points; the demand of the ship itself is determined by a dice throw. That is all you need to know, you can now play the game.

Santiago de Cuba takes the tactical, ratty, weasly nature of Cuba and marries it to the shortness of Havana. Due to player chaos and interaction you cannot plan for a path to victory: instead you must be opportunistic, and keep an eye out that the player after you doesn’t get a good action too easily. This is not very exciting, but it helps that the game is done in well over half an hour. Santiago de Cuba does [i]not[/i] have the destructive chaos of Havana at 4 players (which sees players being awarded with resources they cannot use, or playing cards they have no interest in just in case it turns out they need the defensive measures). It takes what is good, and leaves the bad.

Unfortunately, my partner really disliked the fact that this game used the same artwork [i]again[/i] and so was against purchasing a copy. My fellow players remarked that they'd rather play Cuba. As for myself: I wouldn’t mind selling off both Cuba and Hanava, and making do with just this little game. My partner doesn’t want to let go of Havana just yet, and hasn’t played Cuba sufficiently often to make this kind of judgment... But we’ll get there eventually. I sincerely hope this is the last game in the Cuba-universe, though.

[b]Update[/b] The game with just 2 players is not as fun nor as interesting as with more players. I strongly recommend to avoid the game at this number, and chalk up the presence of the '2' as a case of marketing wizardry which has nothing to do with giving the owner of the box a pleasant game experience. The rate is given for the 3+ case.

This one seems unaccountably under-appreciated.  It's a fantastic light-weight economic game with elements of worker placement, resource denial, and rondel mechanics.  The theme doesn't jump out at you, but the gameplay is evocative of the idea of using local connections to gain the most profit from exports, so the narrative sits lightly atop the very solid mechanics to make a truly enjoyable experience.

Take on the challenge of doing business in Cuba’s second largest city. To be successful, you’ll need to meet the international demand for Cuba’s many exotic goods and, to do that, you’ll need to make the best use of your connections in the city of Santiago. And that’s going to be a tall order, because you won’t be the only broker looking to profit from Santiago’s many commodities!

RATING: 8.5
This is, in my opinion, a perfect entry-level "Euro-style" game to play that most people (including non-gamers) will enjoy. I really like how the pathway to victory points is very straight-forward (collect goods and sell those goods to the ship), that the iconography is intuitive and easy to teach, and that it's relatively fast-paced and engaging. I took a chance and picked up this game without having played it, and I'm very happy to now have this game in my collection!

RATING: 7
A really nice, quick euro game. It generally plays in under an hour and is easy to teach but doesn't feel at all like a filler.

The only slight downside I've found, in a couple of games, is that with four players it's possible to get stuck visiting the same two locals every time around with no way to get enough money to break the cycle. However, in two and three player games this is not a problem.

RATING: 8
Stripped down worker placement and cube processing game which ingeniously uses a rondel to make each player turn fast and simple. Sometimes, the turn is too simple (ie obvious), but the pay off for speed of play is worth it. Definite flavours of Cuba here, but its faster and more fun. It turns a grinding too long game into a good quick game. 
I also like the way the "rondel" order is randomised making each game a bit different.

Játszottam a "nagy" Cuba játékkal is, de szerintem a hajóra pakoláson kívül nem sok köze van a kettőnek egymáshoz. Amíg az nem annyira jött be, addig ez az egyszerűbb családi játék nagyon bejött. 3 fős játékot próbáltuk ki. Amíg mi a sógorral azzal voltunk elfoglalva, hogyan törjünk borsot egymás orra alá, addig a feleségem szép csendben, fölényesen megnyerte a játékot :). Viszont mindannyian jól szórakoztunk. A játék újrajátszhatóságát nagyon ötletesen oldották meg, habár ezt egy játék alapján igazából még nem tudom eldönteni :). Mindenesetre a kubai szakembereket és az épületlapkákat is minden játék elején véletlenszerűen kell felhelyezni a játéktérre. Ezen kívül kockák segítségével határozható meg az áruigény is, ami ezáltal hajóról hajóra jelentősen változik. Természetesen nem csak a hajó megpakolásával lehet győzelmi ponthoz jutni, hanem találni más forrásokat is. A játékot egyszerű, könnyen érthető szabályok vezérlik és a játék hossza is 1 órán belül marad, ami egy kellemes családi játékká teszi, amennyiben valaki nem riad vissza a kereskedős témától.

Played without the screen for the 1st time; 1st May 2012 (it was a 2-player game). It certainly feels alright (not that it's bad) and added some aggressive decision to block/stop the opponent from sending the demanded goods. I always prefer to play by the manual (I hate house rules) but this one can be a very good variant.

I admire the replayability in this game. Each time you play, will be of different combinations of charaters/persons along the road, and of different combinations of grouped buildings. Simple, elegant and just perfect.

This is my 2nd favorite medium-small box game from Eggertspiele/Gryphon Games after Pergamon.

Some of my tokens, when punched through from it's frame, got a little chipped. :(

Me gusto bastante, la búsqueda fue larga, pero al fin logre encontrar ese juego de gestión de recursos y colocación de trabajadores sencillo, familiar, pero con chicha.
El juego es solido, no es el juego mas complicado del mundo, de hecho es bastante sencillo, pero eso lo hace muy bueno para jugar con novatos porque es difícil perderse, pero tiene su chicha porque debes saber como hacer combos, lo importante de elegir ciertas losetas y de manejar la demanda de productos para las rondas, en azar es bajo, pero la rejugabilidad alta, no puedo decir mucho mas, un juego de no mas de 60 minutos que escala a la perfección de 2 a 4 jugadores.

Szimpatikus játék. A hangulata Cuba valóban, de a játék egész más. Könnyed, taktikai, 1 órába belefér, mégis izgalmas, jól eltalált. gyors.
Itt is áruk, és hajóra pakolás, de más lehetőségek, a seftelésre. 
Megyünk körbe a városban egy autóval, és megállunk az egyes kubaiaknál. Igénybe vesszük kubai emberek képességét, tudását, beszerezve tőlük ezt-azt amazt. egy autót használ mindeki. Majd a az adott kubaihoz kapcsolt házakba lépünk, és ott is a ház képességeit használjuk.
Közben a kikötőbe érve megpakoljuk a hajókat, ezzel szerünk pontokat.
Fix 7 körös -7 hajó rakodás- mindig változó tábla -a házak és a kubaiak helyzete minden játéknál más.
Szóval tetszik.

RATING: 8
2017-02-07 : A variable but shared rondel mechanic with a secondary worker placement action limited by your rondel action choice. The combination of both a rondel and worker placement and everything being in the open (for a 2 player game) means this is a highly tactical game where you gather resources, convert them and ship them at just the right moment. When you pull it off this gives a very satisfactory feeling of having outfoxed your opponent(s). I can see why this is considered best with 2 as then denying victory points to him becomes a viable tactic as well. It's the sort of game I like, but apart from the double rondel/worker mechanic there's nothing really new in here and it might be considered a bit bland and repetitive by some as the game is just a little bit too long.
2017-04-23 : I've now played it across all player counts and it's definitely a best with 3 game - that's the sweet spot for game duration and strategic planning/randomness. Rating is for 3-players, with 2 or 4 this becomes a 6.

Solid two player game that has a few plays in it. With more than two it gets just a "bit" chaotic. Will take a couple of plays to figure out what the optimal paths are. They are not always going to be obvious. Players that make the attempt to plan ahead early in the game will be rewarded.

Moving the car/setting the pace is very interesting. I find this mildly satisfying with two players, but it's just a headache with more.

I like how simplified this game is over Cuba. Variable game set up, quick turns, and just enough Euro to make me feel good about it. Can get long winded though if the ship keeps getting passed over.

Update: kept the game for it's gateway game teaching purposes, but now find myself wanting it to end midway through, and wish I hadn't set it up.

I've certainly played this more times than recorded.  It's one of those, "fill the time slot without being a filler" games that ultimately I decided I ought to buy for my collection, even if most of the time I was playing other people's copies.  Couple of things to watch out for can make this a bit nasty with newcomers vs old hands, but perhaps all the more solid for that.  It's not quite Cuba "lite" but lots there.

The more I play this, the more I like it. I thought the dice were more important, but there are so many ways to score points, and the possibility of little engines occuring, it really entertains me. Get a red good, get a black good, go see Maria, she gives me 2VP and hey, she's got a red flower, and there's the red/black converter, another 4VPs thank you Ka-Ching! And yesterday, one player ran out of money, totally lost control, had no choice but to move to the next space for round after round after round... Very entertaining.

The reason this game is so great, is because it is so versatile. It has plenty of strategic depth and choice, something I really appreciate. It also is very easy to explain and learn. It is a happy medium for length, which means I could always get people to play this game. My first time playing I played three games in a row until 3:30 AM. Replay value is high, and I highly recommend this game, considering I only paid 23 bucks for it.

Emiatt egy 4 fős játékban, szinte soha nem lehet már 3 pontért sem szállítani, nemhogy 4-ért.

Santiago de Cuba takes more than just the setting from Cuba and transforms it into a lighter, more family-friendly offering while keeping some of the general feel of the original. Santiago is a much shorter and more tactical game as a result, yet still offers some things to think about and presents you with a subtly but decisively different experience each time due to the variable setup. As a short light to medium Euro game, you can certainly do worse that that.

If I was ever asked to choose a game that best reflects the stereotypical "dry" feeling of Euros, I would probably point my finger at Santiago de Cuba.  This is very much a "trade cubes for other cubes for victory points" game.  And while there are a couple of ways to do it, SdC cannot escape the fact that it is a very dry game that was outmoded even before it was released.  I'm a big fan of Euros and many of my favourite games share a similar mechanic.  But on top of it they build something interesting, unique, fun, tense, etc.  SdC does nothing to make itself at all interesting when compared to other Euros of this type.  Just go around the board (literally in a circle) and take resources and perform basic actions to convert things to other things or eventually VP.  This might be a "filler" Euro that works for some. For me, it is a yawn fest, half-boiled and an overdone idea to be done again.  To its plus, it works solidly and has great artwork from the (always great) Michael Menzel.

este jogo é uma pequena pérola e funciona muito bem a 2

desagrada-me o facto de ser possível implementar uma estratégia onde as vendas podem ser completamente sabotadas, quer pela opção de reduzir um dado a zero, quer pela opção de pagar e não parar no porto, o que no meu ponto de vista subverte um pouco a ideia do jogo

é possível encontrar uma 'regra da casa' para contornar isso e o jogo torna-se muito mais agradável e temático: por ex. o dado apenas reduz um valor (ou até permitir a opção de poder aumentar) e o custo para quem salta o porto passa para 2 ou 3 moedas

Aside from the strategic placement of property markers to claim a victory-point "tax", this game is almost all reactionary tactics.

Kuba második legnagyobb városában az utcákat végigautózva helyi barátaink és a kerültben megtalálható épületek segítségével törekszünk minél több győzelmi pont elérésére, amelyben nagy szerepe van a beérkezett hajó megfelelő időben történő feltöltésének, kis társaink akadályozásának és a rendelkezésre álló erőforrások legjobb kihasználásának. Aki ebben a legoptimálisabban dönt a játék során, meg is nyeri azt.
Többszöri újrajátszhatósága garantált. Ami nem tetszett: ár/érték arány (bár mi használtan nagyon szép állapotban jóárasítva jutottunk hozzá) és a kis méretű paraván (ez helyett lehet másikat nyomtatni, ha kell).

This combines a lot of my least favorite eurogame mechanics.  Its a worker placement / resource collection game where your available choices on your turn are severely restricted by turn order.  Each decision is very minor and you don't have many choices on each turn.  On your opponent's turn, you can do nothing.  Unlike every good worker placement game on earth, there is no way to effect the turn order, as you simply rotate clockwise for the entire game.  The designer missed the great thing about the Rondel by having all the players moving the same piece around the rondel to activate.  Of course, this means on your turn, you are usually left with only one decently efficient choice unless the player before you screws up.  In a tightly balanced euro like this, that means who you sit next to is more important than the decisions you make in the game.  That is poor design.  The economic goods market is cleverly designed and results in a lot of interaction between the players, but merely exacerbates the player order problem.  Another major issue I had with the game was that there was no progression of your economy.  After playing Cuba, and learning how the sugar could be converted into rarer rum, I was expecting a game where my little economy could grow throughout the game.  I was sorely disappointed to learn that turn 7 was the same as turn one - exactly the same, except you'll have a few different resources you've collected through the course of the game instead of the starting resources.  Of course that also means you could play the game as a 5 turn affair instead of 7 which would improve the time to fun ratio a good bit I think.  The game's biggest problem is also the only thing that gives it any semblance of re-playability:  The worker tiles and the building tiles are placed randomly, and which worker tile you choose limits your selection of a building tile.  Also, you can't choose a building chosen by another player in the last round, because their meeple is there.  So what?  Well, some strong combinations of workers and buildings will exist.  Other combinations will be weaker because they have less synergy.  Because you can't choose something chosen by another player the previous round its very easy for turn order to keep one or two players screwed out of the power actions, or in a place where they have to pay a couple gold a turn to do anything worthwhile.  It just exacerbates the problems caused by a shared rondel and fixed turn order.  Overall this is just not a good game and I think as more gamers play it, the rating will drop on the geek.

This is a quick-playing but slightly involved filler with very nice production values. I'll happily play it. However, gameplay literally consists of going around in a circle and either getting resources or trading them in for different types of resources and/or VPs. I can't help but think that the game is someone's idea of satire, like it's the Platonic ideal of the worst stereotypes about eurogames.

A neat game, plays fast and easy. But the ownership mechanism (Alonso) feels like a "gamebreaker" to me. The player/players that get good ownerships (tiles where you can ship goods) will win. They can trigg the boat, and put low dice on the boat, so you have to ship thru the tiles, and each time the other players do that they get 1 VP.

Only online play at yucata.de. Rieneck took the movement mechanism from his own title Der Pate from 2010, combined it with a resource conversion where it was combined with a dice allocation mechanism previously and transferred it to the Cuba theme. Interaction is less direct with decisions being mostly tactical. The result is a more standard inoffensive fare that works well but lacks the spark to distinguish itself from the mass of other releases in the field of comparably short light to medium Euros.

Random placing of citizens and buildings makes sure that the game has repeat play value and different dynamic every time, but inside a play it might well end up being repetitive.

At its best as a two-player game. Low-luck and predictability gives you a lot of "if I do this, they'll do this, and then I'll do this", but without making the game drag on. Dual-action worker placement are also a cool aspect of it. Always enjoy the Puerto Rico-like shipping.

Brilliant flawless game design.  Nice replayability due to how the different tiles are randomized at start and how that has a good impact on decisions during the game.  Love the way the dice are implemented here for market demand and manipulation as I do the way running out of money causes you a real problem.  It's probably a 10 for me as a 2 player game and an 8 as a 4 player game.  It's my favorite of Cuba/Havana/Santiago de Cuba though they are all pretty good games.

Only played it 2 player.

An okay game. One of the most beautifully illustrated boards I've seen. One of Michael Menzels best works I think.

We had 3 major issues with the game.

1. Player goods supposed to be hidden
The goods being of a fixed number. So just by glancing at the table you could see how many resources your opponent has hidden behind his player screen. This is the biggest flaw of the game but it's something you'll just notice in 2player games I think. Guess you could "fix it" by putting the goods in bags.

2. Runaway leader.
Once you get in the lead and you know what your opponent has you can easily manipulate the game in your favor. The player that gets an early lead should manage to win quite easily unless he does a mistake. This is also something thats most likely just a problem with the 2 player game.

3. Progression of the game.
I feel like the game is lacking of any "progression curve"(for the lack of better words). It's early game feels the same as the mid game... which feels the same as the end game. You feel like you've just played 7 rounds feeling nearly the same. The tension doesn't build up at all and nothing changes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.2
For some reason until now I believed it's a strongly dice-based game, a kind of Cuba dice game after the kind of Cuba card game that Havana is. But no, dice are just the in-game randomizers; it's a rather straightforward rondel game with a commonly moved marker and a board that is randomized on two levels in the set-up. I like how it manages to bring back so much of the theme and feel of Cuba, using a very different mechanism, while keeping it short and quite accessible (okay, now we played longer than an hour but it was a learning game). Also I like the restricted "one-worker worker placement" aspect familiar from Le Havre, a very different game with the same setting. In the end, the game doesn't feel that tense as I'd like but is still fine.

I prefer with three where there is much more control.  With four, the game cycles through far too quickly and there is little one can do to slow down the leader/catch up.  The most interesting mechanism is that you first take a regular action (hiring a character) and then take a building action (based on the rose color).  However, each game is different as the order of the characters will change and the buildings will also move around quite a bit so the combos will change.  This one is probably the best of the trilogy - the game plays crisply and smoothly.  There is some nastiness that can occur with the zeroing action of the demand and/or closing down character tiles in front of a person with no money...bad news there...:-)

I heard that this game was "Puerto Rico--light." That's definitely not the case. It's not an engine building game at all, and mostly tactical, not strategic. It's a rondel/pick-up and deliver game (in which you move in a circular motion around Santiago picking up goods from local vendors and take ownership of property along the way). While it didn't match the rumors I had heard, I did still enjoy the game. I could see this feeling a little samey if you play it enough. I like the dice mechanism though (I've seen this in Grog Island as well, a game that, incidentally, I was not to keen on). I also like the short play time. The components are okay, and the directions are not bad. The box is a good size. In fact, if this was a medium-sized (Ticket to Ride) box, I probably wouldn't hold onto it. As I'm writing this, I'm still wondering how much I like it. It's definitely not innovative, it's also not extraordinary in any way, but it's also not offensive. Overall, I think I'm a little disappointed. The real estate option doesn't seem particularly viable in a 2 player game, and that's supposed to be where this game plays best. For now, I'm going to rate it a 6. If I end up holding onto it, it might get better with age.

7/27/15:

After a second play, I have no interest in every playing this game again. The gain money/rush to port strategy dominates gameplay and leaves a sour, anti-climatic taste in your mouth. Lowered rating to 5.

I rate this a 6 after 11 games. The game works and it´s pretty to look at, but it is rather repetitive and bland. The setup will vary a lot between games, but there isn´t a lot of variation within each session. It has served well as a 2-player with the son since he was 7, and it´s a good game with adults as a longer filler after a heavy game. I will happily play my copy from time to time but it´s not a game I would seek out today.

First I thought this game is just too simple and linear. But after we started playing it with "suitable" friends this game opened up and showed its real possibilities.
Now it is a big favourit. Very atmospheric in artwork, even more if we put a handful of Cuban tracks in the cd player while playing. 
Definitely best with four players as some of the buildings and strategies are just masking sense when the most players are around the table. There are plenty of tactics in this game with the raw materials, the buildins converting tfhem into classic products, the limitations in amounts, the demand on the ships which can be influenced on our favour, the car movements and the corruption what makes features unavailable for the round being for other players. 
We played a lot already and it is still full of surprises. I am glad not to let this gem to collect dust on the shelf after the first couple of tries.

I really prefer this as a 2-Player game.  It's a lot of fun, plays quickly, and it has good choices.  3-player is okay, but it reduces your ability to make strategic choices.  4-player is just more chaotic, though still fun.

It's a very clever game, marrying a rondel with worker placement and pickup and delivery.  The theme really comes through in the way goods and abilities manifest, and the art is fantastic.  This game is an all-around great package.

After Cuba this is a lighter interesting take on action selection.  Now the board is an action wheel.  Players move around it and can always pay more to move further to trigger actions.  Each action also belongs to a sub-category of further actions that can be triggered.  So basically, you're deciding what 2 small actions you want, trying to collect commodities and turn them into VPs, either through selling them to the ship (based on demand) or through one of the special actions.  Simple and surprisingly engaging.

Really solid, 'condensed' gateway euro game, but it does have some issues. First and foremost, it feels longer than it should be. I always find myself rushing the game towards the end (delivering wood, picking dice with smaller numbers on them, etc.). Second, I really don't like fiddling with the victory point tokens, there has to be a more elegant way... the fact that the player shields are way too small doesn't help either.

I'm almost ready to get rid of this one.

A nagytesó Cubának az áramvonalasított, családi változata. A magyar társasjáték díjat kicsit túlzónak érzem, de kétségkívül nem egy rossz játék, sőt...

Jóval többet hoz, mint amennyit kinéznénk belőle. Az épület és a kubai szereplők lapkáinak kombinációja szinte végtelen, így rengetegszer újrajátszható, hiszen minden játék során máshová kerülnek az értékesebb akciómezők és épületek.

A paravánokat feleslegesnek érzem, mivel elég kicsi az árukészlet, simán fejben tartható, hogy ki mit gyűjt.

A győzelem a kiválóan időzített behajózásokon múlik, csakúgy mint a nagytesó (Cuba) esetén. Egyébként a két játék között a tematikán kívül ez az egyetlen közös pont talán...

Könnyen felfogható szabályok, izgalmas játékmenet, egyszóval ideális családi társas, sőt talán még a gamereknek sem olyan reménytelen eset...

This game is ridiculously fun! Just played it twice with Pirate Nate. So simple, so deceptively simple, but it unfolds like a switchblade--fast and lethal! 

The theme is crazy fun. We lit cigars, wore Panama hats, played Buena Vista Social Club on the iPod, glared at each other under the brims of out hats and said things like, "Senor, I theenk you are quite meestaken..."

The randomness of the Cubans and the Buildings creates a wonderful matrix of decisions and combinations. It is part worker-placement, part (quasi-) engine-building, part resource management and part pick-up & deliver.

One of the funnest games I have ever played. Panama hats off to the brilliant designer, Michael Rieneck.

Now I have to go pull the shrink off Cuba...

This is a great medium light game to introduce people to euro games. The rules are very simple and straightforward. Most of the game is spent trying to maximize victory points by shipping resources and using buildings.

A bite-sized Euro that utilizes the rondel mechanism very well. The game is quick and light, but it reminds me of Dominion with how the players who see the cool combos are going to do better. Sort of feels like a distant cousin to Puerto Rico, but thankfully isn't anywhere near as lengthy. I like this one for what it is. It puts a lot of control in the player's hands while still moving along at a quick pace.

Un juego perfecto para la introduccion a los eurogames. La tematica esta bien inegrada con la mecanica, siendo esta ultima de una dureza medio-baja y debido a ello les puede resultar muy "sencillo" para jugadores expertos pero no por ello prescindible como entrante entre otros juegos mas complejos. La oferta-demanda cambiante que ofrece el juego como metodo de obtener PV y la colocacion aleatoria de los diferentes edificios a los que acceder para planificar estrategias, aportan mucha rejugabilidad (aqui debo añadir que los componentes, incluido el tablero que es precioso, son de buena calidad) y variacion entre partidas. lo peor a destacar de el, en mi opinion, quizas sea que a cuantos mas jugadores, menor es la posibilidad de poder preveer las acciones de los demas ni de recordar que o cuantas cosas tiene cada quien tras su pantalla de juego. Seria un aspecto a mejorar sin duda, pero que para nada lo hace un mal juego; a dos jugadores funciona excelentemente.

En resumen, 100% recomendado

Easy to play and light resource collecting / selling game.  Maintains a rating of 7 due to the mechanic of manipulation.  Players will purposely try to reduce the markets need for a particular resource while another player will try to close out the ability for a player to do so.  The game is less about resource collection and more about demand manipulation.

4 player game for 1 hour was enjoyable enough. I think the screens are a bit small and fiddly, but the gameplay was relatively enjoyable.

Variable set-up game where everyone shares a space going around the board picking up goods and selling them for points at the shipyard.  There are 5 different goods, coins, and at each location you get to use a special power out of a choice of three.

A typical light/medium Eurogame - no really new element but hints of this game or the other... mashed up wonderfully. Here players race on a card around a port, trying to gather goods to unload on the cargo ship for points, stopping at every other door and asking locals for help. Of course this help means gathering points, money to make the car advance or goods, to trade collected goods or to disturb the opponent's drive.

The game is light, pleasant if a bit luck-dependant (the demand of materials is decided by dice throws, the first player can get a sometimes decisive edge at the beginning) and replayable enough - the houses and different favours are all represented on tiles that are laid at random at the beginning of the game. Funnily enough, the topic actually fits the mechanisms - the scarcity of money leads to lots of favour exchanges.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Sweet stuff, especially with two or three. The random tile layout adds subtle variation and, although the cube-shuffling is fairly routine, there are enough screwage and second-guessing options to keep it a tight-run thing up to the final scoring. It's also refreshing to have a game that rewards a gradual gain of VPs, rather than a sudden rush to convert resources in the last couple of rounds.

Best thing out of Essen 2011 as far as I'm concerned.

Like Havana, Santiago de Cuba is thematically related to Cuba but has little in common with it. Players take the role of shipping agents, supplying a series of freighters with goods for export. The players take turns progressing around a variable rondel, collecting and converting goods. Each ship demands different random cargo.

There are two particularly nice elements to Santiago de Cuba:

First of all, there is a primary rondel of 10 spaces which are colour-coded into four categories. There is a secondary rondel keyed to the colours of the first. The combinations and order of spaces are accordingly very variable between games. This should keep things fresh.

Secondly, the players move together on the primary rondel, but only the active player benefits on their turn. Thus opponents may skip past the spaces you require, or block them by taking actions first. There is a lot of interaction.

I have not yet played Santiago de Cuba two-player, but I think it will be excellent; possibly the best way to play. I am looking forward to it.

Otherwise:
The components are nice and the artwork is good. I find Santiago de Cuba is quite friendly to colourblind players. The rules are easy to learn and simple to reference. Teaching takes 5-10 minutes, the game three-quarters of an hour. SdC is a fine lightweight Euro: a good candidate for occasions when there isn't time for something longer. My rating may easily increase after playing 2er.

A pleasing spinoff from Cuba, using the same artwork and components, and streamlining the whole production and shipping concept into a one-moving-figure rondel type format which links to special powers. So you decide how far you want, and are willing to afford, to move the car to get to the production space you want, and that links to several buildings to give you an extra action boost. Eventually someone will decide to land on the shipping space and you convert goods into VPs Puerto Rico style. The aim is to convert goods into VPs more efficiently than your opponents, and there's multiple ways to go about it. Turns are fast, there's a decent decision to make each turn. A solid lightweight Euro with great art and components.

An enjoyable and unique light-med economic game with much replayability. Easy to learn and teach. I thought it would have a similar yet lighter gameplay as Puerto Rico, but it felt more like a lighter Caylus, but with more of a focus on competition for shipping goods. [I am not able to compare this to Caylus Magna Carta as I have not played that, yet.]

I thought it a nice 2-player. I've not played with any other counts, yet.

update 2015.12.28.
Négy személlyel hosszú idő után egy újabb játék. Most is gyors volt és viszonylag jól lehet taktikázni is. Szerintem egy jó játék!
A lényege. Egy kubai kikötőben vagyunk, kereskedünk ezzel-azzal (dohány, szivar, cukornád, rum stb.) az öbölben van egy főutca, ahol megyünk körbe-körbe és különböző akciókat hajtunk végre. Ahol megállunk annak megfelelően a tábla felső részén is végrehajtunk egy akciót a különböző épületekben (bank, Casino, feketepiac stb.)
Ha körbe ér az autó, akkor be tudjuk váltani a terményeinket gyp-ra. Amikor elmegy a hetedik hajó, akkor vége a játéknak.

Funny story. I started my rules explanation by relaying the all-important "Do NOT run out of money!" tip I'd seen in multiple threads. With the 7th ship ready to sail, a perfect set of goods to sell and what I thought was a competitive number of stockpiled victory points, I rushed the end by spending my last 6 coins to jump to the spot right before the port. I forgot that the game doesn't actually end unless the 7th ship _sails_away_ so we took another lap around the Cubans with my opponent merrily demonstrating the wisdom of my earlier advice. I did not win.

A vicious, highly interactive game with more dick-moves than a porn set. That said, there is little actual "take that" and, unless you run out of money *cough*, you can never be completely blocked from taking meaningful turns. The game moved along quickly despite us both being a bit AP for our first play.

We got one or two minor rules wrong, but nothing that would have impacted our enjoyment of the game.

Would play again. Very curious to see if different arrangements of buildings and Cubans changes the game enough to give it sufficient longevity.

I had this one on my wishlist for a long time (which probably means I didn't want it THAT badly) - and finally bought it. Sadly, it didn't meet my expectations. Yes, I knew this is a light euro, but for me, it doesn't have any staying power. The setup is random, but it doesn't change a lot. The games are very samey, mostly tactical, no reason to plan in advance. Some actions can screw you over  in a blink of an eye. I think there are better light euros out there, and for experienced players this will be boring and sometimes frustrating.

Not a bad game, but not very good either.

I'm not sure I enjoy this game... the commodities are fairly volative and it's near impossible to establish which goods will be worth grabbing. Shipping can be shut down too easily, so conversion to rum and cigar followed by returning those for VP seems about the only valid strategy, which makes owning the relevant buildings all the more valuable.

A player's optimal move depends entirely on the action the previous player performed, which renders long-term strategy in this game almost nil.

I like how the game changes with each setup. Combinations and the order of things have to be examined and evaluated with each game. What worked once before probably won't the next time. This is good. The game is also simple to understand, teach and quick to play. Taken as a light game with some interesting, yet not too challenging decisions to be made, it does the job of entertaining and not outstaying its welcome. It's a bit too simple for my taste, but I'm happy to play every now and then. Scores an extra rating point for the variable setup.

A very nice, lighter version of Cuba with some interesting elements to it.  I like the taking over tiles and how it can add points when others use it.  Three is probably the best number to play this, but it is a good 2p game as well.  I like it and expect to play it a bit more in the future.

I'm going to downgrade this to a 7.  I have a feeling this is one of those games that whoever gets an early lead is going to be the winner.  This one may get traded.

We played the whole Cuba trilogy in one night and this was for me the me weakest. Now Havana's interaction level is way above the rest (it's from a different designer) so no contest there. Santiago is much more direct offspring of Cuba (or maybe even expansion El Presidente) - get stuff, change into other stuff, rinse, repeat. True SdC is a tiny bit more interactive then its parent (which is very MPS). However Cuba has a breadth of strategic paths and room to explore. This does not. It's a ho-hum light/medium euro with nothing to be really excited about. Now if you like low interaction euros and seek a medium-light game it might be for you. Nothing memorable here. Ok neat illustrations, but for that - get Havana. 

EDIT: reason this has fallen to 1.0 - it's just the mediocre of the mediocre. Derivative and worst recycling of the entire Cuba line. When you re-warm mac and cheese for the 5th time...

RATING: 6
Played a few 2P and 3P games. In this game, players go around a wheel, taking the effects of the spot where they land. Players may opt to pay extra to move further in the wheel though. At the end of the wheel, players ship goods according to the demand determined at the start of the round. 

Apart from the shipping theme, this game doesn't really feel like Cuba. There are some light 'take that' effects that are welcome, and if played with aggressive players, this pleasant game can turn vicious. This game fits nicely in the shuffle of 'super-fillers', though in my opinion, it is rather forgettable.

A Cuba grafikájával megtámogatott könnyedebb játék. A Cubától eltérően itt nincsenek birtokaink és az épületekből is csak hármat vehetünk meg a játék során. A játékosok Santiagóban haladnak egy autóval. Egyet ingyen lehet lépni a körúton a többiért egyenként 1 pesót kell fizetni. Minden hely ad valami bónuszt, általában terményt, illetve egy szín három épülete közül egyet lehet használni. A kocsi beléphet útja során a kikötőbe, ahol kockadobás határozza meg, hogy milyen árut lehet eladni. Tehát sima árugyűjtögető és jó időben eladó játékról van szó, amelyet 12 épület bonyolít meg. Könnyed, szép kivitelű játék. Nekem kimondottan tetszett. Elég gyors is egy parti. A Cubát nehéznek találók mindenképpen próbálják ki!

[2017-02-26]
A kikötőben 1 árut eladó épületet én túl erősnek érzem, pontosabban ha azt valaki megveszi túl sok pontot szerezhet belőle a játék során, mivel az ellenfelei sokat fogják használni.

A Euro game with just the right amount of depth and play time to convince a board game neophyte to play. It's pretty fun imagining all the players cramped in the same car, yelling at the driver to stop. Decent replay value thanks to the variable position of buildings, action spaces and the relation of one to the others.

Fun, attractive-looking game. Moves fast.  Setting is the 1950s, maybe 60s in Santiago, Cuba's port front. Easy to learn; 7 rounds of picking up commodities to meet the incoming ship's demand for goods. Beautifully colored dice represent different commodities; number on dice represents quantity of that product that is in demand that round.  Additional action can be taken by occupying or controlling various buildings beyond the waterfront Cuban stores.

While I did enjoy playing this and managing the ships, I'm not sure that there is anything here that is really, really new or compelling that makes me want to rush out and buy or play this. I like the ownership of the buildings (like Genoa) and amassing resources, and there were some tension-building elements (like when to use the ships), but not quite enough to really draw me in.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I've only played it at yucata, but I imagine this should play pretty quickly. Not especially innovative, but a solid light worker placement/pick-up-and-deliver/rondel-ish game. It's set in the Cuba universe (similar theme and artwork), but I think I prefer the original game and Havana, both of which are heavier than this one. Still, this might be a nice quick filler, I guess.

--- Summary ---
SETUP
Each game, the order of the rondel actions is randomized. The rondel is actually a series of people placed on a circular track, including a pre-printed shipping space on the board. The people shows an action and an icon for a building-location. At the start of each game, the buildings assigned to each location (3 each) are also randomized. Players share a single action-selection meeple -- the car -- which starts just past the harbor spot. The harbor starts with a ship with randomized demands (the last player rolls 5 colored d6, each with a different number distribution; discards 1); the value marker is on the 2 space (track shows 2, 3, or 4 = value of goods delivered).

GAME TURN
On your turn, move the car clockwise (1st space free; 1 gold per space beyond that). If you move past the harbor, advance the goods value one space. Take the person-action you land on (earn goods/VP/money, take ownership of a building, etc.). Then move your meeple to a different, unoccupied building at the indicated location and take that building-action (convert goods, earn money/VP, deliver good immediately, manipulate goods demands or value, etc.).

If the car lands on the harbor space, players take turns delivering a single type of good to the ship; earn VP per good according to the value track. Wood may be delivered in place of any type of good, but only for 2VP each. As you deliver goods, decrease the number showing on the matching die. When all players pass, advance one space on the round counter; player triggering ship rerolls dice (and discards one die). 

WINNER
The game ends after 7 rounds (= ship deliveries). Most VP wins!

The level of interactivity is interesting and the action selection mechanic work pretty well although it is sold as a mechanic rather than thematic at any level.
The endless possible way to end a turn may be issue making the game much longer than needed and that can turn players off to a lenghty boring game. It should not take more than 45 minutes under any circumstance!

Hm, something is missing in this Euro. Optimizing your victory points but especially with 4 players it is really hard to plan anything in this game. You play more in the style of looking at your options when it is your turn and then try to make the best move. With 2 players you can effect your own and your opponents moves better, but still, what I usually like about Euros is the control you have as a player (though there are exceptions like Carcassonne where you are very dependent on the luck of the tile draw and I love it anyway), "Santiago de Cuba" is nice enough when played but never takes me to that 'let's play again'-place. 
With a few more plays, I find it getting rather dull, I have to remove another 0.5, sadly.
Update: I tried this again and for some weird reason, I do enjoy it a lot more now... Not sure why, anyway, half point up again.

Straightforward game play with a few tricks up it's sleeve.  The random layout somewhat makes for a different strategy each game.  It's a quick playing euro with no arc.  Similar games with no arc: Royal Palace, Finca.  I suppose it's a Hans im Gluck style game with less wood.  I like it for it's quickness, graphic design and familiarity.  The strike against it is that it is very flat.  At least with 2 players, more players may spice it up a touch.

Played mostly 2 players games. Great! You have to balance playing to reach your goal and hindering your opponent. There's many ways you can go to achieve your goals.

I prefer the 2 players version. With 4 players, you are kind of stuck in a loop, always landing on the same spaces turn after turn. You can try to change that by paying more to move differently, but when your turn comes again, you will be stuck in the same spot, having the same choices offered to you.

Have not tried 3 players.

It works quite well with two, is quick and provides you with many decisions to make. You'll have a better opportunity to visit different spots and to follow different strategies.

RATING: 8
Santiago de Cuba is an excellent and yet quite simple tactical euro game. Players are travelling together by one car around the city, trying to get as much goods for them as possible, so they can later sell it with profit to a ship waiting in harbor. Demands of captain are set by roll of dice and active player can decide, which four of five dice will be used. Precisely one car and three buildings hidden behind each stop (seller) are source of difficult choices, which are waiting for you every turn. Supplying of ship will guarantee you longed-for victory points. Every car movement is important, so you are paying closely even, when its not your turn. You have to constantly plan and shift your intensions based on events. Simple commercial game with difficult choices. Something, that can hardly exist. But let’s make an exception this time. Santiago de Cuba is a perfect pick for demanding or relaxation play.

Wow! What a difference from Cuba! SdC is themed much like Cuba--get goods and ship them--but is both far simpler and far more variable. Players move one marker around an operation track, then (usually) pick one of three buildings to activate. Both the operations and the buildings are randomized at game set up.

Played once at 3p and once at 4p. The 4p scores were far lower than the 3p scores. One player attributed this to the extra player, but I'm not sure. Certainly they should be lower since the available market is divided by 4 instead of by 3, but this isn't the sole source of VPs, and I think the 4p scores were half the 3p scores, which argues the random set up had a big effect as well.

Read the rules. Some interesting mechanics for this shorter version of Cuba. Since there are nine Cuban tiles for the car to drive around, it seems like it would be fairly chaotic to be able to use the specific Cuban you would like to use. This probably means that it is a better 2 player game than 3 or 4. Will wait for reviews before making a purchase decision.

The designer was handed a thankless task:  replicate Cuba but with dice and simpler gameplay.  Menzel's artwork evokes the mood of Cuba, but the gameplay falls flat.  Despite the random deployment of characters and buildings, the game is [literally and figuratively] trapped in a circular flow of play.  This is worker placement and resource conversion distilled to a repetitious grind.

The game works. It does have choices, and it ends when it should.

RATING: 7.5
DIY version [now owned]. Felt compelled to try this for a long time, for some reason, even though comments I read don't make it sound very good. It sounds like a major simplification of a game like Puerto Rico or Caylus MC, which does interest me, as I find those games to be too difficult to play for what I get out of them.

I played two 3p games (I've read that 2p is best; I prefer playing with as many as possible, so 3p is the compromise). I enjoyed it more than I probably should. You have a fairly small number of choices at any moment, and at least the illusion that they are important. You can screw the other players by buying buildings they want to use, or harming the demand for goods they want. It's a fairly short game that plays very smoothly with a nice rhythm.

The main problem with the game is the difficulty of planning ahead. It feels chaotic; I can't quite put my finger on what causes it (aside from the obvious fact that the players share a single collective Rondel and don't move at a constant rate).

I also find it dissatisfying how the goods do not really have different values. On average there is slightly more demand for citrus than other goods, but that's just in terms of quantity that can be sold. Cigars and rum are relatively difficult to acquire but don't sell for any more than their component ingredients; the only advantage is that you can trade cigars/rum to the Cafe for (less-than-average) VPs. Wood is wild (have not seen that before) and it is actually worth less. I think it may be too easy to acquire, as much as it is fun to screw somebody's intended sale by beating them to the punch, substituting worthless wood. In one of my games, using the building that inactivates a Cuban was used repeatedly on the wood guy.

I feel like the dice roll too low, too. Eventually it's going to happen that you roll two or three zeroes, i.e. no demand for any but a couple of goods, and it's a drag.

It is so simple and fast to play that I find it easy to focus on the positives.

...Own the game now. I love how elegantly Rieneck has crammed so much drafting and "option bundling" onto such a small board: The market-like Rondel, the colors tying each market option to a menu of buildings, and the ability to speculate on buildings you think will get used a lot. This is one of the most painless micromove/efficiency games. It's almost always interesting and not too difficult to evaluate one's options for a given turn. Upping .5 to 7.5.

I think the biggest downside is how random refreshing the boat is. You can quite abruptly find that the goods you've accumulated are no longer shippable any time in the near future. If this were corrected, there still wouldn't be a lot of long-term strategy, though. Mainly just what buildings you buy, as those purchases are permanent.

I don't think you should play with the screens. It's more fun to know how many VPs everybody has so you can tell who to scheme against.

Surprisingly this is a multiplayer euro that shines with 2 players. I haved played 3 and 2 players, and 2p makes by far the most interesting spot because you can plan your next actions, making it a bit meatier/strategic than with 3/4 players. It is fast, very tactical and not a brain braining class but with enough interesting decisions to enjoy both gamers and casual players. Beautiful arts, theme and components makes it a strong recommendation for playing with your wife/girlfriend. My rate for 2P is 8, for 3/4P is 7, averaged rate: 7.5

Welcome to Santiago, the second largest city in Cuba, home of legendary rum and birthplace of the revolution! The chaotic streets hum with the sounds of bustling crowds and busy commerce. Cargo ships constantly arrive and depart from the port. Demand is continuous, if unpredictable, for a supply of local products such as exotic fruits, sugar, rum, tobacco, and cigars.

In Santiago de Cuba, your business card says "broker", but in reality you're a shady wheeler-dealer who arranges deals with the locals and with corruptible officials to move goods and meet the demand of those ever-present cargo ships – and your ability to procure these goods is only as reliable as your "connections".

At the start of the game, nine locals – the Cubans – are randomly arranged on a path around Santiago, with the port being the tenth location on the circuit. Each Cuban has a different ability: e.g., give a player two tobacco, give a player a good of his choice, force opponents to give you something, give money or victory points (VPs), and seize a building or allow a player to use a previously seized building. What are these buildings? At the start of the game, twelve buildings are randomly placed on the game board in four color-coded groups (white, yellow, etc.) of three. As with the Cubans, these buildings give players a special ability when used: convert tobacco to cigars, change VPs to money or vica versa, increase the value of goods delivered to the ship, render a Cuban inactive for the next round, and so on.

Players will deliver goods to seven ships throughout the course of the game. The demand for each ship is determined via a die roll; the active player rolls five dice – one for each type of good – then chooses four of the values rolled to represent demand for goods of the same color as the die.

All players share a car and travel around the island together. On a turn, the active player can move the car to the next location on the path (whether Cuban or port) for free, or pay one peso for each spot moved beyond that. After taking a Cuban action, the player then must move his player piece to a building of the same color as the flower on that Cuban. If he takes an action in a building owned by someone else, that player earns 1 VP. (One Cuban allows a player to use the same building where his piece is currently located.)

If a player moves to port, players take turns delivering all goods of one type to the ship to meet demand, adjusting the demand dice as needed. A player earns 2-4 VP for each good delivered; a player doesn't have to deliver goods. If the ship's demand isn't met after everyone delivers or passes, the VP bounty per good is increased by one and the ship remains in place – unless the value was already at 4 VP, in which case the ship sails. In this case, or when all the demand is met, a new ship comes into port with new demand values.

After seven ships have sailed, the players earn 1 VP for every three goods still on hand, then tally their VPs. The player with the most VPs wins, with ties broken by goods remaining, then money.

Each game poses new tactical challenges for the players, thanks to ever-changing combinations of buildings, Cuban inhabitants and demand for goods.

Rating after one play with two. Not sure if I will give it another try, as there are so many better games in my collection that scratch the same itch in the same playing time. The game felt a little bland, mainly because (a) it starts to feel samey halfway through and (b) there are plenty opportunities to screw other players, which makes it almost impossible to plan ahead. So an OK game, but for me not really worth owning.

Although I have major problems with Santiago, I still have to recognize it for what it does well.  Beautiful board and just an interesting game overall.

However, the game's critics have a point.  There isn't much new here.  And, quite frankly, Havana is the better game.  (Have never played Cuba.)  

I've come to realize rondels bore me to tears.  This is a rondel game.  Have disliked it in every game I've encountered - Vikings, Finca, Seeland and others.  The reason is because there's nothing to build on with a rondel mechanic.  There's no engine, no story for the most part - although I'd say the rondel in Santago is more thematic than most.  Overall, it's a shame the mechanic is flat and uninteresting since it seems like most games with rondels are beautiful to look at.

I really dig this game.  Nice Rondel mechanism at work, plus some light worker placement.  There are really some tough decisions to make during the game.

(after 1 4p game)  Nothing super new here, and the choices within the game are somewhat limited, BUT I would play again if asked to see if there is more there.  You do control when things ship and can raise the price per shipment - I think groupthink comes into play on this one.

Surprisingly simple and lighter feel of a light-medium euro game but still hold tactical plan to win the game. Perfect for short time game and new players.

I was between 7 and 8 for this particular game, and only for now i leave it at 7 in order to see if i have the same hunger to play it in the future. The game offers a great replayability level by changing the position of the tiles on the board and in some cases changes completely the strategy of the players! It's a good, rather simple game that has to do with how to gain and handle money, resources and victory points. Give it a try!

Bel gestionale veloce che nasce come spin off
di Cuba da cui riprende il tema e le illustrazioni.
Sistema di movimento stile Antike anche se la rondella è sapientemente nascosta nel gioco.
Unico neo, le azioni soprattutto quelle di carico, posso favorire molto il giocatore alla sinistra di chi carica. Con un pò di attenzione il problema è comunque controllabile.

Light-medium weight (2, investment/speculation).
Medium interaction (indirect, but powerful).
Medium theme application.

A great little 1 hour Euro with fantastic art and an approachable theme. Ultimately more engaging in a shorter play time than the main game Cuba from which it's derived.

I bought this game on theme alone. I am of Cuban decent and I figured why not?  I game based in Cuba.  Its a decent game, but there are some concepts that blow my mind.  Like how does a car end on one side of the dock and then magically appear on the other side of the dock.  that and with 4 players the game takes WAY too long, I think it is best with 2.

The third game in a row of titles were the art and characters are based on the original Cuba. A game I sometimes use to convince new players to play something other then Catan or Ticket to Ride. And usually they are pleasantly surprised.

Artwork is excellent. Box size is spot on. Components too. Game play is simple but effective. The random placement of buildings and helpers will ensure the game will be different each time.

After a couple of mostly enjoyable plays I was left with mixed feelings. Friends feedback largely centred on the bad feeling of being robbed of coins and having action slots "switched off" for one or more rounds running. Interference of player's planning aside, there is a game here. One where you whizz around the port in a taxi carrying out some very nicely themed actions. With a small board and seemingly simple rules set you'd expect the game to be over quickly. It can drag on a bit. That will be my own personal complaint. Somewhat unusual because I do enjoy plenty of long games. Santiago de Cuba is not something I'd ever consider buying based on the reactions of friends at the table.

Good solid eurogame. I like that you get the Cuban action and a second Building action each turn and that all are randomized at the beginning of each game. It is not great but I like it a lot.

Just a very 'meh' experience.
I enjoy Havanah a bit more, but Cuba is the real deal.
There are other, better games than this that are more 'fun'.
Well at least for me.

Very good game.
Sometimes rounds seem to repetetive, but it all depends on how much money people spend on movement.

Though i'm playing this constantly, but i still can't call it a very fun game for me. It's ok with two players, but too chaotic with more. You can't do much strategy then. But it still gives a pleasant feel of selecting sites, collecting resources or special abilities.

Although it feels superficially derivative of Puerto Rico (in that the main way you gain VP is loading commodities onto a ship that only accepts certain ones), it's a lot simpler to learn the rules and grasp the basic strategy. My wife loved this one.

Everything seems to work smooth, there is many things to do all the time, and the game is not longer than it should be. It is also beuatiful. Then you find out, there aren't any important decisions really, you just go with the flow, without much tension. Someone steels oranges, so you seal the container. You don't expect this when you read the rules, you however feel it when you play the game. If this wasn't my wife's favourite, it would go out of the house.
EDIT: it did eventually go.

awesome game!...kind of the mini-version of Cuba, more so than Havana...where Havana was just the roles and building for points part of Cuba in a card game, this is the roles, building powers and shipping of Cuba in a small board game...play can be really fast, so watch your opponents carefully...

This game should be the little brother of the game Cuba. We can not say we agree on that, because we just don’t know the big brother. We saw it once on a table, but never played it. Even didn’t read a review about the game, so we don’t even know how the mechanisms works.

Good thing about that, is the fact we started to play the little brother completely fresh. The rules were pretty simple to explain, and we started to play after 10 minutes of explaining.  As decribed in the short explanation of this game above, the mechanisms of this game, are pretty easy. This is a light game. For us, that is a good thing, because most of the games we like and play are light games. But, after playing this one, it tastes like more. More depth in the game, is what I’m meaning then. It felt like something was missing. I just guess we have to try the big brother once. Over all, a nice and easy family game. Easy to explain and play. Graphics are nice, and you’ll get the feeling that you’re a trader that has to deliver the ships. But the feeling that you’re a wheeler-dealer? That doesn’t happen. I guess, not giving that feeling is the missing part.

This is a fun, quick, light-yet-angst-ridden game.  It somehow distills and fast-forwards [thing=30380][/thing], while keeping the feel of some of its elements.  The way the ship demand is handled is perfect torture, and a nice distinction from its progenitor, while giving the same sense of urgency that the ships did in it.

This is an excellent resource management game that manages to not get lost in its mechanisms and allows the players to make choices to which the repercussions and/or possible outcomes are known.

I find so many new games in this style (i.e., 'euro' games) get so caught up in delivering new mechanisms that they lose one of two things: the clarity of cause > effect that should be strived for, or the element of fun. Sometimes, sadly, both are lost.

A simple vista un juego simple ya que las reglas y la mecánica lo son, pero después de las primeras partidas gana en profundidad, sobre todo a dos jugadores.

A very fun Qwixx variant. Tight and fast to play with a lot of back and forth. perfect length to play a best-two-of-three.

A very nice and highly recommended variant of Qwixx. But beware: The game feeling is quite different. Whereas Qwixx is the light and fast-paced dice game, Qwixx: Das Duell is a much more tactical variant. I like both but each at its time.

Also a good game, but Qwixx iself is at least as good as this with two players.

Last year i didn't bought this one because I already own Qwixx. That was a mistake. Nice box with a space to trow the dice. Really made for 2 players due to the "take that" rule on the first marker.
You love to play Qwixx with only 2? Than this is a must have!

Variant van Qwixx speciaal voor 2. Net iets anders maar geen grote meerwaarde.

The original Qwixx is one of our most played games (also due to it's very short play time). This should be an instant hit.

RATING: 6.5
FUN: 80% Qwixx, but the stacking opportunities means you need to approach this differently.

UNIQUE: as this is the offspring of Qwixx, it gets no points for originality.

NEGATIVES: it loses some of the Qwixx charm because no one else gets to do things on someone else's turn.

A nice variant of the superb dice game which has a few new twists. After 5 plays I still can say: we like the duel very much.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8/10):[/COLOR]

[i]Qwixx: Das Duell is an excellent implementation of Qwixx for two players. I was skeptical at first, especially since I enjoyed Qwixx with two. However; since I have an obsession with roll and write dice games I finally decided to get a copy. 

The big change in Das Duell is that players now place discs on a shared board. This opens up the game for a lot of player interaction because it is now possible to remove someone else's disc. Also, under certain circumstances you can also stack discs on one number, this combined with the other rules differences really change how Das Duell plays out in comparison to Qwixx. You really need to pay attention to what your opponent is doing; at times you will make a move that may be sub-optimal  to stop your opponent from racking up points. 

Game play is brisk, typically wrapping up in 15 minutes or so. I am really impressed with the changes the designer has made; he was quite successful in transforming Qwixx from a good 2p game to an excellent one in Qwixx: Das Duell. I believe that folks who don't like Qwixx may enjoy Das Duell because of the player interaction. The game is no longer driven by optimization; instead you are reacting to what your opponent is doing. Hopefully there will be a US release of Das Duell, but there are a few retailers that have import copies if you're interested.[/i]

Qwixx! But for 2 players. Using the same board and some discs you can mark the same number multiple times. If you are a fan of qwixx and play 2p games this is definitely one for you. I know it will go well in so many households. I hope there will be a US printing. Easy, fast and fun. Solid game.

[NSV 2016 edition] {Abstract; dice; 2p} Qwixx: Das Duell is a run and short 2p filler.  This a basic dice game, so this is quite luck driven; you are subject to the dice throw to make decisions.  In early game, there are more decisions to make.  At late game, you can't do much because most positions and rows are occupied - the result of a throw helps you make a decision.

There is indirect player interaction.  Players have to decision whether to block a row so that his/her opponent cannot stack more tokens, etc.  Yet, they are just simple decisions.

The quality of the dice is exceptional: vibrant colour and sturdy.  I like that box cover is also a dice tray.  Good production.  I prefer more colourful tokens.  The grey and black player pieces look too dull.

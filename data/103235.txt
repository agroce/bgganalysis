The game played better than the rules made it out to be (seemed boring).  It was blandly themed, but it was neat watching this board economy grow.  It was a fun puzzle each turn to try to figure out the best possible moves from many choices.

Solid cube conversion game to maximise VP's. Much depends on the location of tiles and how you spot good routes. The early loss of money and points might appear devastating, but this is compensated for by the ability to place opponents building tiles in expensive locations.

Pár hete próbáltam a City Tycoont, egy másik idei esseni lapkalerakós játékot. Akaratlanul is ahhoz hasonlítom ezt. Először is: a Singapore szerintem sokkal egyszerűbb, és ami mellette szól: nem rontották el a színekkel:) De túl sok pozitívumot nem találtam benne, ami a legjobban hiányzik, az talán valami eredeti ötlet... Mert abból kevés van benne. Ami érdekes (bár nem feltétlen válik a játék javára), az a kiegyenlítő mechanizmus (többieknek kijelölheti az utolsó a telkek helyét, a királycsinálást meg felsőfokon beleviszi a játékba szerintem). Ami nagyon nem tetszett, az az, hogy nagyon nagy eséllyel az épületek jó részét nem is tudom használni az egész játékban, egyszerűen azért, mert túl messze vannak. Persze alakulhat úgy, hogy a közelembe kerül valami tápos lapka (akár olyan is, ami a mozgásban segít), de ez már bőven szerencse kérdése is szerintem. Nagyon kevés játéknál éreztem, hogy ennyire kis ráhatásom lenne a dolgokra, és csak tehetetlenül nézem, ahogy a távoli mezőkön dőlnek a pontok. 
Ami meglepett, hogy a rajtaütésekkel szerzett veszteség mennyire jelentéktelen hatással volt a végkimenetelre. A győztes nem is látott közelről ópiumot, pedig úgy látom ezt szánták a fő csavarnak a játékban. Kíváncsi vagyok, hogy akik többet játszottak vele, azoknál is ilyen jelentéktelen volt-e ez a rész.
A pontozás módja is azt sugallja, hogy nem vitték túlzásba a tesztelést: kiegyensúlyozatlan az egész.

Nem tetszett na, kár ragozni. Akkor már inkább a City Tycoon.
Pedig a szabály alapján bizakodó voltam!
---
Aludtam rá néhányat. Még egy gond van a játékkal: van egy teljesen egyértelmű nyerő stratégia: végig 0 ponton állni, gyűjteni a kockákat, a végén mindent beváltani gyorsan (a sok pont miatt ugye ilyenkor dől a pénz is az 5-ösököből). Ha pedig mindenki ezt csinálja, mivel ez a legjobb, akkor unalmas antijáték az egész...

A fair try, but the end result is a game that has nothing more to offer than others in each kind, and also the whole "move your guy through the streets" thing is frustrating. Yes, it offers some strategy by limiting the options but the whole board is a mess after a while, so, I didn't like it.

An interesting tile-laying game where the player in last gets to determine where the other players must place their tile and also gets to place his first.  The catch up mechanic is significant and most of the points are scored on the last two turns of the game so gearing up for the finish is key.  There is also an interesting mechanic where using certain black buildings and having the opium good (1 of 4 available goods) can be expensive if you get caught using them.

RATING: 6
Build board as you go. Major Euro-y cube pushing going on, with a couple twists. One is a push you luck aspect, where the more you use "illegal" buildings, the riskier it gets. The second is the turn order mechanic, where the player with the fewest points decides where each player builds, and how much they have to pay. It works, but I didnt like that part. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Best played with experienced players.  Newbies tend to struggle and can cause imbalance.  Also, the game is a bit too luck heavy and swingy/unbalanced because some late game buildings can be used to score a ton of points, while other buildings are nearly worthless, and you have no idea what building tiles are coming up next.  The game might be better if it had some kind of building market preview so players could see one or two turns into the future and plan ahead for their precious few moves and actions; however, this could backfire and make the game longer and more brain-burning without reducing the chaos because you have no idea which building plots the Raffles player will assign to each person so a building you planned to use could end up on the opposite side of the world.  This "Raffles" effect (not knowing where buildings will end up) is just an integral part of this game; therefore it's important to have a flexible strategy to deal with the chaos and to keep your options open by racing to get your second worker/helper as soon as the extra worker building gets built.  Caution: you have 3 precious moves per turn so this is ultimately a game of efficiency and all of the points-making buildings require lots of money so a dollar or two spent willy-nilly on roads could cost you many points in the end.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Better than expected from the rule preparation. Catching up seems hard as everyone tends to do the same thing to maximize points.

I think the illegal buildings should give a more significant return to make opium a more attractive alternative to legal business activities.

A bit of a problem with group think- follow the leader as several players with take the same path.

Update: after 3 plays it's done. Finito. Traded it away.

RATING: 4
I'm a big fan of the eurogame genre, but this one is about as bland and middle of the road as it gets.  Place a network of tiles that perform various cube/VP/money conversions, and run your pawns around to use them for a VP scoring engine.

The problem here is that the tiles are added throughout the game, with the tiles getting more and more powerful and efficient as the game goes on, and by more efficient, I mean crazily more efficient.  So, it's best to just collect a ton of cubes, making money as necessary, and waiting to cash all of the cubes in for points near the end of the game when the point/VP ratios are drastically better.

Overall, just a boring game design that seems to have problems in the game progression.

A disappointing experience. I was interested mostly because of the spatial action activation concept, but in practice the board grows far too large for any decent strategical notion to take root. There are few point tiles sprinkled throughout the main body, meaning that the game itself is a rather boring affair of grabbing tons of cubes and trading them in at the end. Would suit my gaming needs much better with more movement options and one draw stack less. Finally, Singapore suffers from a usability issue in that tiles covered with a little meeple, a ownership marker, and several roads, are completely covered, so you can't see what the tile is going to do.

I love the feel of this game as it progresses: an undeveloped area turns into a warren-like maze of shady enterprises. The draws from the raid bag every time someone builds or uses one of the dark buildings add tension and occasional hilarity.

Unfortunately, the one time I played the pacing was very, very screwy. Nobody was able to hold onto much in the way of points or money for the first half or two-thirds of the game, and nearly all of the game's points were scored in the last two turns. On the final turn of the game, I went from 2 points to 54 points, as I'd quasi-accidentally stockpiled loads of materials which I could then turn in to phase III buildings for obscene numbers of VPs.

Plus, of course, those tension-filled draws from the raid bag ended up injecting a fair amount of chaos. Random draws would devastate a player's plans, forcing several turns to recover. (Managing this risk is simply a part of the game, I expect, but some people still won't like it.)

Singapore has a lot of replay with the way the tile-based board.  It is interesting how the combos pop up.  Some are intentional, and some happen on their own.  
The trick is to be open to ditching the point engine you are in for a better one that opens up.
It is a clever game, as long as the theme doesn't bother your delicate sensibilities.  Though the illicit buildings add a lot to the game.
The only complaint I have is that the catch up mechanism feel a little heavy handed if you're not the one using it.  But that also depends on initial board layout.

Nothing terribly memorable, but another interesting historical Eurogame where players build buildings throughout Singapore and move pawns around activating those buildings. Opium presents an interesting punishment, but offers higher rewards for taking on that extra risk.

I am even more hesitant to rate Singapore than I am Dungeon Petz, simply because at this point I have difficult separating the game from the wonderful experience I had playing it late night at BGG.Con 2011. In many ways this game seems to be yet another cube pushing efficiency exercise, but there is enough interesting things going on, with the area movement part of the game, the forced tile placement, and the overall element of strategic planning involved in trying to account for logistical chains for multiple turns. Of course, there may be enough chaotic elements due reduce this capability but I am not yet sure how significant it is.

Very simple and straightforward. A very easy game to teach! But all this simplicity is probably a bad thing for what is cast as a medium-weight eurogame, as the game can be long and there aren't that many strategic options. 

Some people may complain that it's random, and it can be a problem given that winning margins can be close and points gain can be arbitrary. But I think the real problem is that because all the good tiles are at the end of the game and that players are expected to punish the leader, this game is all about avoiding being the leader until the end of the game and sneaking in for the win (which goes back to my comment about lack of strategic options).

Being from Singapore, I do have to address the theme.  It is not as pasted on as it seems, and that is one redeeming quality of the game.

RATING: 3
Dry, dull, and tension-less. The epitome of cube converting with very little else of interest going on. Had an interesting idea in that your dude can move 1-3 tiles per turn and activate the tile's ability each time, but all we were doing was getting red cubes to turn into green cubes so as to turn into money or VPs so we could get some blue cubes to turn into yellow cubes and... 

The yellow cubes represent opium and at some point there may be a raid causing the player with the most yellow to take a hit but it didn't really factor into the game. That should be an important consideration that tilts player decisions but it doesn't have enough teeth and didn't factor into the game in a meaningful way.

I did like the spatial element of the game as you had to consider where your guy was going to end his turn. Perhaps that could be used better elsewhere.

I liked this game reasonably well except for one glaring irritation:  I hated the way building plots are assigned by Raffles each turn.  It completely turned me off.  I think there's a good game hiding in there if the plot assignment mechanism were different.

Singapore is a game which I wanted to be more than it is. Let it be known that I love Peer Sylvester's work, particularly because he often brings a significant and notable twist to the games he designs which playfully subverts the genre he momentarily occupies.

Here, the genre is Euro-resource-conversation, and the twists include:
- [b]Rubber-banding[/b]: the game includesPower-grid-esque rubber band that is pronounced enough that the game becomes one of brinksmanship, aiming to be in last by granting other players points (e.g., using their buildings) -- this entails choosing how the network of buildings expands (which also includes how much lots cost, in a game where money is already tight);
- [b]Spatiality[/b]: gone is the usual magic equivalency of travel between buildings (e.g., distance is made uniform through architectural magic) of most games. You want to make a conversion, you have to walk there and distance matters.
- [b]Push-you-luck[/b]: some buildings generate slight advantages over others, but have a risk-reward system which might, or more appropriately will, cost you in the long run (but with above banding, this can also be a useful way to fall behind).
- [b]Refusing incrementality[/b]: This game literally explodes in the late game as players shift from jockeying for position into fully exploiting their point potential rather than having a homogenous point increase that is friendly and clearly signals leadership.

Yet, it is worth noting that while these are great twists on a genre that has become formulaic at times, it is still at its heart a Euro-resource-conversion game. This means that while there is interaction between relative point positioning (and how lots are distributed) and network building, the resource-conversion part of the game still feels independant-esque (as workers do not block movement or access to buildings nor are there ways of mucking about with already acquired supplies).

Soulless cube-pusher.
They didn't even try to paste a theme unto it.. all there is are colored cubes you'll transform into VPs.

The game is bearable if you'll make fun of it the whole time..

Also the player order mechanic is incredibly wonky.. in the early game it makes complete sense to go for the least VPs so you can tell the other players where they have to build.

Rarely have I seen a game that so clearly wants you to play it a certain way. 

Singapore lays out up front what you need to do to win. You should be dancing around, occasionally giving opponents points, occasionally sacrificing some of your own for cash, and positioning yourself to get control of Raffles.

At the same time, you need to be ready for the late game. Points start out in a bit of a dry season, but when that rainy season hits they will pour from the heavens in sheets. To make sure you don't miss out, you'll need to load your holds with copious amounts of cash and goods.

I'm glad I got to play it because if someone had described it to me, I never would have thought I would have such an adverse reaction. I dislike there being a strongly "right" way to play, especially when there is such a mechanical similarity between the available paths of victory. My MtG "career" should have taught me this, since I clearly fall into the Johnny/Spike category. I like there to be more creativity, and I like being able to find niche strategies that can work given certain conditions. 

I also dislike the positional play early on. I decided to try to ignore the play around Raffles and instead focus on making cash and getting an early lead. This went over like a lead balloon. My late game was anemic, and I got blown out by the end game buildings. 

I originally called the Raffles mechanic rubber banding, but now I'm not so sure that's a good descriptor. Rubber banding implies that you can't get too much of a lead or the game will reign you in. In Singapore's case, it's not so much rubber banding as a conversion of what your "score" is at different stages of the game. VPs are not the measure of success in the opening turns. They are a timing mechanism to limit what actions you can and cannot take, and to force you into using your opponents' buildings. The only time they start being an actual indicator of success is in the late game, when you trade the goods and money you acquired earlier. Far more than VPs, goods and cash are the real indicator of relative status until late stage 2/stage 3.

When all is said and done, Singapore is not a game for me. I'd play it again to see if my assessment holds up, and maybe another game after that to be sure, but I sincerely doubt it would become a staple for me. My low ranking is an indicator of this, and while I don't think the game is particularly flawed, it's not something I feel I could ever come to love. Singapore wants you to be patient, subtle, and forward thinking. I learned long ago that none of those were my particular strong suit.

Note: Take my low ranking with a grain of salt. I got entirely demolished playing this, and it may be coloring my perceptions.

Really restricting and un fun in a lot of ways.

Disappointing. Felt longer and more restricting than a game with illegal activities should be. 

The raid mechanic is pointless, slows the game for no real benefit or penalty. Illegal buildings feel like an after thought, they are no more powerful or fun than the regular buildings. In fact removing those buildings, opium and the raid mechanic and the game will play the same. 

Every movement is restricted and you sometimes get caught using the same three buildings for several rounds. Having the second worker, doesn't really accomplish much more.

Neat theme supported by short rules. The Raffles mechanism nicely encourages using the buildings of others, but at the same time it encourages also turtling and it feels like Raffles is giving a too major of an advantage in the beginnings of turns. The black buildings and opium add a neat push your luck mechanism that unfortunately suffers from the black buildings not being strong enough. I'm not that fond of the extra powerful late game point machines and the game also includes the worst ever screens I've encountered. They fall easily due to players breathing. The game can be very prone to AP and is a bit of a rinse-repeat exercise. Would benefit from being a bit shorter in the goods hoarding part of the game.

There is a nice idea how to give some advantage for the player who is in the last position, but what won't work here is ridiculous unbalanced buildings. With a good luck you'll get great combo which brings you plenty of points only in a couple rounds and TADAAA you'll win / or can win and it doesn't matter how badly you've played earlier. The board is too small which brings some usability issues as well. All the rest here is something what we've seen many-many times so I'mt not that excited.

RATING: 4
I feel like this is a flawed masterpiece in some ways.  I really enjoyed the game, but there are aspects which are frustrating.  All the high scoring buildings which will basically decide the game are built in the final 2-3 rounds.  The earlier rounds are relatively meaningless outside of trying to collect a large collection of cubes to trade in near the end.  I found both the raid mechanism very interesting (can be quite painful as you lose half your opium and half your money when you get raided by the police).  The fun aspect of this mechanism is that you can activate the black market on your turn to try and cause a raid on someone else...of course, you are only setting yourself up for a potential future raid in the process.  The wrestling for last place aspect can get old (advantage in that you select the lots on which people build and you yourself get to select the first building and build first).  People need to know the big point producers that will come in play in the final couple rounds.

=====================================

My second play confirmed that this game is not for me.  This is one I want to like, but I do not like games that reward a person who is in last place and this particular game grants way too much power to that person.  Have little to no desire to try again.

The ability of the player in last place to target other player(s) for the expensive build locations seems excessive - maybe if the £4 space was £3 it would work out better.
The later stage 3 buildings have little opportunity to be actioned as it is likely thy will be placed far away from where the pawns are positioned. 
The game just feels "clunky" to me and does not play smoothly.

I like the route selection system, the way the board grows, and the artwork. 

The tile powers seem horribly out of balance, though. First of all, the black tiles don't seem quite strong enough for anyone actually wanting to choose them instead of white tiles, and green cubes are seriously weaker than any of the other colors. Second, the ridiculously powerful end game scoring tiles tend to turn this into a betting game: You just hoard a ridiculous amount of cubes, stay last on the scoring track, and hope that the big VP tile matching your cube pile turns up early enough so that you'll get two activations out of it.

Suffers from soft Chinese cardboard pieces with sharp corners. Also, resource cubes are in player colors.

I wouldn't have given it a look if it wasn't by Peer Sylvester, designer of the wonderful King of Siam. The growth engine with topology is a clever idea, but didn't seem to work well in practice. As a catch-up mechanism, the last-place player gets to decide where the others will build each turn, which makes it virtually impossible to set up a coherent engine. But worse than that, the buildings themselves are almost universally tedious cube/money/VP conversions, some of which are just outright better than others. Reading about the game, I was intrigued by the 'black-market' mechanic, where you can choose to take a risk to access more powerful 'illegal' buildings. But in practice, the illegal buildings don't seem much more powerful, if at all. While it should feel thematically different to use them, actually it boils down to getting some bad-ass yellow cubes instead of mundane green and red ones.

Blend of typical features - place tiles that convey actions, move pawns to trigger actions, convert cubes to money and/or victory points.  New features are the use of a risky good (opium) which could trigger a "raid" and lose of goods and money.  Another feature is the last place player deciding where everyone else will build this turn.  Nice to help spread out the buildings a player controls and/or to make it more costly for the leading players.

At first blush, the tiles don't appear that much different, but there is an acceleration in the game with money and cubes flowing more readily late as routes are developed and the race to VPs is on.

An oddity - very abstract but to me deserving of a higher rank than it has. It's slightly undone by the slow start, whereas the later rounds are more tense and involving.

Nagyon érdekes, hogy egy 2011-es esseni játék egy szintén akkor megjelenthez hasonlít, bár voltak már ilyen "érdekességek". A Singapore ugyanis majdnem egy az egyben City Tycoon csak itt nem az erőmű lapkák termelése határozza meg az egy körben levő akciók számát, hanem összesen van három. Ugyanúgy lapkákat rakunk le, amivel árukat, pénzt vagy győzelmi pontot lehet szerezni. Ez a hármas (áru, pénz, győzelmi pont) váltásának minden variációja szerepel a lerakandó lapkákon. A játékba még az visz színt, hogy a hátul levő játékos kezdi a köröket és ő határozza meg, hogy a minden körben lerakott lapkákat milyen drága területekre kell rakniuk a játékosoknak. Jó ez a kiegyenlítő mechanizmus, jobban átláthatók a lapkák a CT-hez képest. A három akció is könnyebbé teszi a játékot. Szóval, mintha a CT-t játszaná az ember, de egy kicsit jobban átgondolva. De a játék ugyanolyan száraz, a szerencse szerepe talán kicsit erős lehet a jobb lapkák lekerülése szempontjából. A királycsinálás szintén megjelenhet. Szóval egy kicsit jobban tetszett, mint a CT, de semmi izgalmat nem váltott ki belőlem. Iparosmunka, semmi több.

Players collectively build out a set of tiles offering various resource gathering/conversion powers. Each player can move their person up to three time and activate up to three buildings, so there's an engaging spatial movement element. Using another player's building gives them 1VP.

In theory, broader strategy is driven by the fact that the player with fewest VPs chooses where all players can build. The intention seems to be that there is a deliberate race to the bottom -- the player who can choose building locations can create for themselves sets of contiguous buildings with good synergies while denying the same to opponents; their buildings will therefore be in high demand and will score them many points. (There is also the minor benefit of making other players pay $4 to build instead of $1-2.) Of course, producing useful buildings in this way encourages other players to give you points such that you are no longer in a position to control proceedings, so the exercise seems vaguely self-defeating. The game also seems strongly biased towards hoarding resources for use on very late buildings which grant up to 28 points per use, giving the strong impression that much of the early game placement is completely irrelevant. Many buildings will never be used.

I find Singapore intensely frustrating because it feels tantalizingly close to something great. Peer Sylvester was also responsible for the notoriously clever King of Siam, so in the first few games I suspected that the fault lay with the players. Was there something wrong with our groupthink? Would its subtleties shine only with more experience?

But repeat plays have not shown any improvement. Identifying and building valuable chains of tiles provides a tactical challenge, but the whole package is just missing something. I don't know exactly what, but every game is a letdown.

Lovely production and lovely ideas, doesn't quite work. No patience left for it.

Lay tiles, move pawns, produce cubes, convert cubes, earn VP. Less humdrum than it sounds: route plotting can be tricky, and the last-placed player dictates where all players place their single new tile this turn, which can hit the cashflow of other players. Not sure about the illicit goods - are they really that much better than legitimate goods to compensate for the penalties of getting caught?

Pretty fun tile/worker placement. I enjoyed the modular map, together with the tile and road placement, there's a lot of board variability. Opium was a little risky for my blood though.

Two complaints. It's easy to 'corner the market' on resources early and take away other players' options. And if you start out taking negative VPs, you can bully everyone around forcing them to build on expensive property.

Otherwise it's a pretty fun game. I'd play again, but I'm not sure I'd buy it.

A very dry little game, even with the opium aspect of the game.

I quite enjoyed it, but there was very little which made it stand out from the hundreds of other Euro resource collection/conversion games out there.

With an AP player, this could very easily descend into murder.

Down from 6.8 to 5.8.

Some interesting mechanisms in what ends up being a poor game. The lot assignment offers little except making for annoying layouts and wasting a lot of time. The black market bag is exciting, but can totally screw a player--one player got nailed twice in the end game, losing about 40 points--it is far too strong. Due to the low mobility of one pawn and the possibly extreme action-expense of getting a second pawn, action choice can be extremely limited. If a close-paired production building is near its matching point generator, players have no option but to pump the top-performing generator. Any tactics or other strategies are untenable. If the pump involves the black market, you still have to pump it, and trust to luck with no risk management. An unbalanced game. Probably I should rate Singapore as 1, broken, but it does have some nice design features, especially a modular board.

After playing much more correctly, the black market is far less odious (though still can be catastrophic, however the Raffles (last) player has far too much power. The only way to bring the Raffles player down is for other players to give him points by using his buildings faster than he can burn points. If players get aggressive about this it should end up being a very odd exercise of racing to burn points down to zero first. If they're not aggressive, the Raffles player can make the most efficient point generating arrangements, which other players will have to pay him to use, and prevent other players from arranging alternative point generators.

Admittedly, if everyone tried everything possible to unseat the Raffles player (including giving him points), the first two phases of the game would might result in a race the the bottom, with the Raffles player changing frequently. However, this would still result in the Raffles player at the point the first high scoring tile from set III being able to make that tile as advantageous to him as possible. Other players would either have to pay to use it or use something less optimal for fewer turns. Losing opium when you're in a buy-sell cycle trying to generate points is still disastrous.

Possible variant: Low player does not assign lots, he just plays first--lot assignment seems to slow the game a lot, in part by making the board inefficient, and as mentioned above, makes the Raffles player far too powerful. The assign lot tile is still active and can be used to reserve a space. Another possible rule change is, when fined, you can pay £3 per cube in bribes to save your opium--otherwise a raid could cause the loss of 20+ points.

Last, this just isn't a $45-60 game. If it worked well, it would be comparable to Glen More or Egizia at $20-30.

I will note that the rating is a little wonky, because we apparently misplayed one of the rules.

Still, the last-player dictates is a cute mechanic, but it does feel a little random, especially because you get VPs when visiting other shops. The roads also seem unnecessarily fiddly.

Provisional rating, one play.  The decisions to be made were interesting - putting together combinations of tile movements and activations to gather resources or VPs.  My main issue was the 'lumpiness' of the VP gathering: a tile came out that provided 25VP, and through planning and (self-admitted) good fortune one player activated it once more than anyone else.  Be warned, the rulebook is vague or misleading on several points, check the forums here for clarifications.

2016-08-13 - Dry. Tentative 7.5 rating. Get cubes, trade it in for VPs. Money is really tight. Few, simple rules.
2016-08-22 - Plays relatively quickly. Appears that the basic strategy is to grab lots of cubes, ensure your pawn is nearby the lastest (level 3) buildings for 20+ VPs. In a 4p game, you can get about 2-3 rounds per building level (stack). If you are able to you can get 40+ points in the last 2-3 rounds of the game. The biggest point buildings are 5x cubes of same colour (red, blue) + 10 GBP = 25 VP. A 25 VP boost = at least a 5 GBP bonus so you "recover" some money. Rating dropping from 7.5 -> 5

Typischer euro kun je ze haast niet krijgen.

Spelers bouwen de stad singapore op. Dit doen ze niet alleen door allerlei productiegebouwen te bouwen, maar ook illegale praktijken worden opgebouwd. Dit zorgt voor een push your luck element, want des te meer je criminele activiteiten doet, des te groter het risico dat je gepakt wordt en een boete moet betalen. Dit is het enige echt originele in een verder toch vrij middelmatig spel.

Zal het zeker nog wel een keer willen spelen.

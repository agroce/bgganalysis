Juego muy temático, semicooperativo aunque bastante más cooperativo en general, ya que el juego te obliga a ello. Lo definiría como un "elige tu propia aventura" sacando cartas y siempre con mucho azar en cada cosa que sucede.  Tiene ciertas ideas muy buenas, y aunque por pulir ciertas reglas, esta logrado. Como negativo/positivo lo recomendaría a quien guste de los cooperativos con mucho azar, si no les importa la duración de las partidas que suelen durar muchísimo, bastante más de las 2 horas que reza el juego, al tener que estar entre todos tomando las decisiones. El setup también es bastante costoso. Le pongo cierta nota alta por destacar ciertas ideas y sensación inmersiva de la temática, pero no es para nada mi tipo favorito de juego, por no gustarme los cooperativos y menos con tanto azar. Llevo 2 partidas completas, habria que ver también la rejugabilidad que la veo muy dudosa. Yo creo que se podría adaptar mejor por otras mecánicas que no fueran carta-azar, y mejorar bastante el juego.

I played it the other day and I liked it. In my opinion its 2 strongest features are:
- It's a semi-cooperative game. Having to interact with other players along the play, you really feel that you are playing with OTHER people; not just sitting next to someone while you play.
- The atmosphere gets you into the story part of the game, not only in the game itself. This way, you can get really involved.

Enjoy it!

As much I wanted to love the game after seeing the fabulous cards and the theme, the crappy rules ruin everything. There are just too many situations not covered by the rules or the explanation being ambiguous, such as the winning conditions. At certain points, I even felt that the game had not been play tested at all before publishing it. 

Luckily the rules state that common sense can be used in unclear situations. In practice this means that you can make your own rules which ultimately allowed us to enjoy the game.

When it comes to the gameplay, I would have liked to see more of crisis management in different situations. Now the only problem was to get the food and wood needed. Whatever energy you had left was spent on exploring. This became tedious after a while leaving the exploring the only exciting part of the game.

Bottom line is that I could play again if we agreed on the rules first.

An interesting semi-coop.  I like the choose your own adventure style of storytelling.  The theme is pretty solid and relates well with the game mechanics though at times I felt like I was puzzling things out as opposed to traipsing around a semi-deserted island.  Some of the mechanics just felt mechanical, as if they were included for the sake of being rather than for thematic elements.

So why not a higher rating?  A few reasons.  It's longer than it needs to be.  The semi-coop angle doesn't quite work for me.  It encourages cooperation until someone doesn't and says "screw you, I'm doing what's best for me!"  ...but then the group can lose, so...  yeah.  Not a perfect solution.  Also, the game sort of boils down to burning through the exploration decks which is a little reductive for a game that otherwise looks and feels like it should be doing more.  Don't get me wrong, the exploration angle is interesting-ish and kinda fun but only if you're doing it.  If you're not exploring, then you sit around for 5-20 min. while the explorers resolve all their crap.  And oh, by the way, they tend to get story point rewards for it while you're tending camp and helping the group.  And getting nothing.

I'd play this again, largely to see how the story changes and how the game holds up to repeated plays.  I'm a little shaky on the replay value because it reduces down to explorations but I'd definitely give it another go.

As indicated by another BGG user, the real adventure was trying to decipher the cards and rules. In addition to the poor quality of the rules, the game feels like it was not fully tested. After reading the forums here and at BSK (Spanish boardgame site), my impression is that the problem may not be the amount of testing but the incorporation of late changes in the testing process (that introduced new untested problems). According to the comments of some testers, there are important differences between some rules in the game and those used during playtesting. Things like: (1) the jumping of all the players after finishing a desk,(2) the impossibility of doing anything useful in a round because energy must be paid in advance (when placing the meeple, which sometimes makes resting only useful for the next turn rather than the current turns), (3) that lessions are only recovered at the end of resting which may prevent the gain of energy, (4) the text of some cards that confirms that some changes took place late in the production process because the text does not fit with the normal rules, (5) the null explanation of key situations regarding exploration or handling the health of your character, (6) the long FAQ that still leaves many questions unanswered, etc.. , suggest that the game is more a beta version than a fully finished functional product. Big disappointment.

Gran sensación de inmersión. Las tramas aportan un toque novelesco al juego lo que ayuda en gran medida a la sensación de inmersión en el personaje y es que, literalmente, te metes en la piel de un náufrago que intenta desesperadamente salvar su vida tratando de abandonar la isla!

An enjoyable mostly cooperative game.  Comparisons with Robinson Crusoe: Adventure on the Cursed Island seem inevitable as they are coops with the same theme, published within a year of each other.  I found Castaways' choose your own adventure-style narative more coherent than Robinson's; there is a real sense of the consequences of earlier decisions and the lasting impact of events.  Castaways is also a rather more straightforward game to learn and play.

Castaways is mostly cooperative in that the players must work together to get off the island.  However, if they succeed there will be a winner, the player who accumulates the most story points from exploring the island, salvaging objects from a shipwreck and spending time writing accounts of derring-do in their journal rather than helping their fellow players.  As in all semi-cooperative games, there is a tension between playing for the win and avoiding defeat for everyone.  There is the potential for someone behaving quite selfishly to wreck the game as the other players refuse to carry them to victory.  I won't say that Castaways has found a fix for that problem, but the difficulty of surviving and getting off the island has been sufficiently apparent to keep players cooperative in my three plays of the game.   

Castaways plays quite long.  The 120 minutes on the box may be possible when playing solitaire.  With groups of three and four we were nudging four hours.  Nonetheless, that unfurling narative remained engaging throughout and there was a constant balancing act between exploring, feeding, developing the camp and making stuff to improve the chances of rescue.  I'm not certain whether that narative will remain engaging in future plays.  Variable decks of event, object and exploration cards will change things to some degree, but the overall aim will remain the same.  There are none of Robinson Crusoe's alternative scenarios.  

Production quality is good with some decent artwork.  The iconography is mostly straightforward.  As the ten-page rules forum suggests, the rulebook could have been clearer on some important points.

This is a theme I have been wanting in games for a while. I have not played Crusoe yet but this delivered in spades. My only problem with the game is the lack of official means to make it pure co-op and the fiddliness of going through the card deck so often. Regardless I would play this would anyone who wanted to.

Not a bad game at all, but has its flaws. It is a lot of work to play, between adding cards, shuffling deck, re-adding cards, and so on.
But it offers a lot of player interactions for a coop game, if you have the good player group (not too competitive, or your game will be broke, nor completely cooperative or you lose the greatest aspect of that game).

In a match against Robinson Crusoe, Castaways is easily beaten in my opinion. A lot more fiddly, less intuitive, less strategic (events hit you harder and are almost impossible to predict), and more scenario-dependent, thus less replayability (Castaway will need some expansions on that point). Only the social aspect and the card driven theme save it from shipwreck.

Very interesting game. At it's core there's worker placement, but then the game allows for real stories to emerge while playing it. The co-op aspect (mixed w/the not-so-co-op mechanics) is a bit strange, but the stories you can find while exploring the island are different every time you play. Also, it is really difficult.

Ingenious "Choose your own adventure" style of competitive game. Unlike Robinson Crusoe, which is more cooperative tactical (and a gem in its own right), this game is about pushing your luck, taking chances, finding a different storyline in every game, and coming back with the most "Story Points", if the crew comes back at all. 

I kept looking for Wilson somewhere in the game, but no joy. ;)

Have played four times now, and don't intend to play again. Replayability is a serious issue with this game. The competitive element to the game potentially breaks it completely but the biggest flaw is the way the end game is triggered and how you determine whether you escaped or not. Rather than aiming toward a clear objective (like in Robinson Crusoe), you have to get a balance between getting to the end of the exploration track as quickly as possible and trying to build and collect everything. Whether you escape or not is nearly entirely down to chance - it just feels so very anti-climactic. Rather than ramping up the tension towards the end, it just kind of fades away. Seriously not fun for any player not included on an exploration, with serious amounts of downtime. And there will be players who don't go exploring if you want to stand a chance of winning. Takes far too long to play for what it is.

I like the basecamp portion of the game, it's more visual and interesting even than Robinson Crusoe.  I also enjoy the expedition component to the game, and the exploration of the island.  After a couple plays there are still several cards left unseen, yet it already has a feel that maybe we've seen everything.  I'd love to see expansions for this and just more adventures on the island and more difficult choices to make.

I'd prefer the game not to feel as rushed, because you're forced to explore-explore-explore every turn, which results in the basecamp portion becoming just this secondary thing.

I'm not a big fan of the semi-cooperative nature of the game either.

Prototipo pendiente aún de publicación. Por confidencialidad, omito momentáneamente valoración y descripción del juego. (Agosto 2011)

Parece que el juego ya fue publicado o está en vías de hacerlo, así que puedo opinar libremente. El juego está bien.. es una historia de supervivencia en una isla y es bastante temático, pero le percibo con poca (muy poca rejugabilidad). En cuanto uno se conozca las cartas, el juego pierde interés. Por lo demás, se puede disfrutar bastante las primeras partidas.

Es un juego semiccoperativo, es decir, de los que me gustan mucho. Las tramas, especialmente en las primeras partidas, hacen que sea un juego inmersivo temáticamente hablando. Quizá la duracción sea un tanto elevada, lo que puede disuadir a según que jugadores o en según que circunstancias.

Very thematic.  I really like the exploration deck that changes throughout the game based on choices.  Every game has different options based on your exploration discovery and random start-up cards.  Rulebook leaves a lot of unanswered questions and its taken two games to figure out the gameplay so its smooth.  Wish they had included a player aid sheet for the turn order as well as made the male/female explorers back/front on the same card.  Overall, happy with it so far.

Unfortunately, this one doesn't hold up over time.  Every game has been a 2-4 hour slogfest that should easily play in half the time.  Some very neat ideas, details, and stories, but not enough for the length.  Want to like it so much more.

This is "Survivor" the board game. The story element is absolutely brilliant: going on expeditions and seeding the other decks with future event cards is by far the most innovative and interesting part of the game. 

However, the "semi-coop" aspect can become a nightmare, especially considering how hard it is to survive on the island. When someone is the fisherman or the cook, the entire group pressures them to stay behind to forage/fish, which might be fine in a normal coop, but only breeds resentment in a competitive game where the only fun to be had (and one of the only ways to score points) lies in exploring the island. 

Like the TV show, I think this game would be fun to watch other people play on TV, but as a game it is far too unstable to be enjoyable for long. Group cohesion easily falls apart, and pure spite might lead someone to throw the game for everyone else when things don't go their way. I hope designers have begun to realize that "semi-coop" is fundamentally flawed because it makes players unsure of their own goals, and muddies the gameplay far more than it should. Nobody wants game night to turn into a psychological study--featuring themselves as the subjects!

Playtested a prototype of this one yesterday and it was a lot of fun but took a long time to play and interpret the English rules which need a lot of clarifying and streamlining. I'm not sure waht my rating should be but I can see this being great fun if it is put together right. The rulebook needs organising better as we missed rules that were important and would have helped us get closer to getting rescued. I think it may be much harder with less players as you won't get a lot of the items and they are so so useful. Please Please Please explain about the food better. i think there are quite a few improvements needed to be made to make this a game people will go back to but then I'm not sure about repeat plays happening. 1 Play.

A close competitor to Robinson Crusoe but I feel the rules are lacking something (or I missed something) in regards to travelling up the mountain/volcano. You can pretty much push your luck and have a mega turn going up the mountain. Regardless, the choose your own adventure game book style of the climb is very thematic and works.

Castaways is thematically rich game.  I'm so involving to play this game.  The themes and story are solid and relate well with the game flow.  I felt like I was working against the weather, managing camp stuffs, setting up bonfire and catching fish to survive.  The story is highly related to the end of your actions and story.  The replayability is an issue of this game but I think it is enough to have so much fun even only after several adventures!
Remarks:
I played something wrong about the Castaways in my play group adventure.
One player must reach the mountain top first.  Then choose any one remaining event card for items needed for rescue.  However, we ended the game when we got the items showing in the current reveal event card.  In other words, if we can collect the required items listed in the event card in this round, we can rescue from the island.  Of course, all castaways should be in the camp (without lost).  We may need additional time to finish the game if we play it right.  But I found that "our variant" also makes sense and can be used to change the game to a short version.

In inevitable comparison to Robinson Crusoe, what this this title lacks in detail (complexity, amount of pieces in play, and the like) it more than makes up for with an increase in competitiveness. Which I like. Also, the foraging/fishing mechanics work extremely well.

A lot of potential for themed adventure expansion add-ons to be easily added, which I sincerely hope will be forthcoming. Although it lacks a variety of different scenarios, each island set-up is unique with randomly determined mini-arcs, which I like very much. And this is is half the price of RC. A solid contender for any game collection, despite the cheap-looking plastic components.

The games gets major bonus points for a plethora of Monkey Island references - always helps to make a winner, in my book!

The exploration in this game is really awesome.  The way that cards in the exploration decks can cause you to put different cards in the other exploration decks depending upon your actions makes this game shine.  It's like a choose-your-own-adventure book but far superior.

However, the camp part of the game is a little bit subpar.  Other worker placement games have far better worker placement.

Getting rescued from the island for having various junk just prevents you from playing the fun part of the game: the exploration deck.

I've only played this solo, making the semi-cooperative aspect pointless.  Writing in your journal just seems stupid.

I feel like the following should have been done:

1) There should have been much more potential for exploration.  The 150 numbered cards should have been 500.
2) The semi-cooperative aspect should have been dropped or somehow made interesting.
3) There should be no potential for early rescue by gathering junk.  The stuff built in the camp should help you some other way.
4) There should be other things that can be done in the camp, with several of them having some sort of card draw that combines with the whole exploration thing.

This game is fun, but I feel like it could have been much more.

Acquired on a trip to Idaho for Gpa Barfuss' funeral.  Part of a "grab bag" game purchase.  I've heard it is like Robinson Crusoe, but I wouldn't know.  It has some fun story telling, but can also be very hard.  I enjoy it as a solo game too.

Not sure if I like the fact that you constantly have to collect wood.  Having played it a few times, the game starts to feel a bit same-y, as you see very similar cards.  Only uniqueness to the game comes from the dice rolls.

Me ha decepcionado completamente. Conocía las reglas, y sabía que me enfrentaba a un tiradados... pero hasta este extremo?? Es que tiras dados incluso para descansar!! Estás tirando dados toda la partida, y las puñaladas y la cooperación podria ser mucho más intensa si no dependiera totalmente del azar. Te encuentras con algo: Tira para ver si es bueno o es malo. Ah, y lo que te encuentras, también es aleatorio... Será todo lo temático que quieran, pero un juego en el que mi capacidad de decidir sobre lo que le ocurre a mi personaje es tan baja, no lo puedo mirar con respeto.

Updated after a second play.  Each with 3 castaways.

Castaways has great theme and I really like the actions available.  The setup was a little long, but I think it was worth all the replay options it gives you.  You have to be in it for the long haul.  A three player game should take 3 hours from what I can tell.  I still need to see how long a solo play takes.

One thing I did not like was the Foot icons on the exploration cards.  With the number of cards in the exploration piles that have icons you will need to explore most of the deck to advance anyway.  I would have really liked it better if the foot icons determined movement rather than finishing the decks.  

One thing that you HAVE to know is to REALLY press the expeditions past the comfort level of getting lost.  If you only press expeditions to the point where you can easily get back you will DOUBLE the time it takes to finish the game.  This can really suck all the fun out of a good game.

There are two parts of the game when it comes to replay value.  The thematic part of the game seems to have great replay value.  This is the story that evolves based on the cards and actions of the game.  Most of the good story elements are rewarded by getting Story Point token, though I think a shark attack while fishing should qualify as well.  The mechanical part of the game has less replay value.  You will have variety of the actions you choose, but they will vary much less than the story.  So you need to think about what is important to you for replay value.

Another thing that I didn't like was the semi cooperative aspect.  It should be played as cooperative only.  I understand that greed gives the players harder decisions to make, but I think it really distracts from the way the game needs to be played.

I had fun with the game.  It is a little long, but I enjoyed the variety of the story.  I need to try a solo play and see if that is the sweet spot for me.

A collaboration game about four castaways who are stranded on a small island. They must collaborate to improve their shelter, gather food to eat and wood to keep the campfire burning, and figure out how to advance to the interior of the island, as only from the vantage point of the highest spot on the island will they have a view of the vast ocean – and even more importantly, a view of the ship on the horizon that promises rescue! The players must manage their time in order to deliver a signal to this passing vessel – but even if they're all rescued, in the end only one player will win, that being the one who writes the best story at the end of the game, the one who lives and retells the greatest adventure from all the survivors, the one who has collected the most story points.

Castaways (Naufragos) is a fun storytelling, adventure game. The game is difficult to win, but fun even when you lose. It's nice to be able to make decisions (as a group, sometimes) and later experience the consequences of those decisions. 

That being said, it is a great concept, but a bit lacking in execution. First, there is a lot of randomness (almost everything requires a die roll). Events are random as well as Plot cards when exploring. This can be frustrating when trying to get the food you need for the round or getting the fire lit. 

Second, as others have stated, the footprint icon on the exploration cards does not seem to have much game effect. We'll see with more plays whether this holds true or not though.

I'm more than a bit disappointed in some of the plot cards. Many have awesome story leads, but seem to be just bait for the inexperienced player to follow. The reward(s) do(es) not justify the added time it takes (or energy expended) to complete. These should be better balanced to make them viable as a path for the castaways. The result is with experienced players, these cards (i.e. Temple) will never be explored. Wasted opportunity.

The game starts out really well and has a fairly immersive story/theme, but it drags toward the end where you sort of start taking the same actions over and over, trying to trigger the endgame. (Explore, explore, explore, because you have to reach the end of the exploration track before you can try to be rescued from the island.)

Unless you enjoy repeating the same story elements over and over, I suspect this one will have limited replayability. After two plays, we've seen the majority of the various card decks.

Still, it's not a bad game and I think the "semi-cooperative" aspect of this game works a lot better than I'd have guessed.

One thought I did have was that this game might be one I'd actual consider playing the 1-player variant of. It's possible that might even be the best way to play it, though I'm just guessing.

Castaways is a near miss, I'd say.

I've played this one several times and it has a mechanic that I've never really seen before.  It uses a kind of encounter deck system that changes depending on your choices and die rolls.  Every time I play that part of the game is different.  It also has a huge amount of these cards.  I haven't managed to exhaust the experience yet.

Way, way too long.  Theme is excellent, but it is very easy to get put on a path of futility, so you spend hours slogging through with no hope of rescue.  Cut the length in half, and the game would be top notch.  As is, it is to be avoided.  Edit: I see that re-playability is an issue.  So if you want to sit though this game again, it's worse on repeated plays due to surprises being spoiled.  Ouch!

Low replay-ability as it is mostly a repeating story where surprises only work once. A bit turned off by the first game when the only real adventure we had was trying to decipher the cards and rules. Still it is not horrible and worth trying once with others who know the game.

RATING: 6
It has some major issues retaining it from being a great game: 1) it's too long for what it delivers, the playtime indicated on the box should be raised up to 4 hours 2) the rulebook is terrible. Seriously, it has to be re-written completely otherwise you'll miss some important rules for sure. Furthermore - I do not know if it is the italian copy only - many situation in the game (due to exploration cards combo) were unclear or seemed a nomsense. Translation/playtesting shall be improved. 3) there is no competition on the action you take, since the most important are always 4x and the 1x benefits the whole group 4)it suffers of some downtime during the exploration phase, when you're not part of the expedition yourself 5) the island track - there is no reward in exporing alone since you'll easily finish the exploration deck and make all the players move on the next one, so no personal benefit at the end 6) some key items were still missing at the end of the game, thus it was impossible to complete it. Apparently if the items are not drown you can loose - and there is nothing you can do to go through the whole deck 7) I think the replaya ility will be an issue after a while.
IN SUMMARY: a missed opportunity for a good game with a refreshing neat exploring mechanic drawned down because of its many flaws.

This game wasn't playtested quite enough, which is a shame. I actually quite enjoy it, but some of the expeditions, like the temple, take so much time that you likely are failing to win the game to explore them. This is the one major complaint I have, but it's very frustrating that there are adventures built in which tantalize you but are forever excluded from a winning strategy.

-A splash of push your luck with ways to mitigate

Cons
-Confusing rulebook

After a couple more plays this starts to feel clunky. The exploration mechanic, the adventure deck and how it randomizes the events is fantastic but the rest of the game...not so much.
- It's very easy to manage health, meaning there's never really any tension. Also makes characters with healing abilities completely useless.
- The game clock is too long. Plenty of opportunities to rest, which dilute the tension
- Some of the actions in the game are extremely weak.
- Semi-coop is very poorly implemented. The decision to be selfish and play competitive is very rarely interesting.

Not solid enough in my opinion. As negative aspects, there are some holes in the rulebook, it's too long (around 4 hours for 4 players) and the balance between the competitive and cooperative side lacks consistency. Anyway, the game is fun if played from time to time, on the graphic side it's nice and it conveys an entertaining gaming experience.

Die deutsche Erstregel ist eine nicht gänzlich zu klärende Entdeckungsreise zu einem Spiel, das wie eine Brettspielvariante des legendären ZDF-Adventvierteilers von Robinson Crusoe daherkommt. Eine Flut von Karten sorgt für ein geheimnisvoll-unkontrollierbares, abenteuerliches Spiel mit kindlich-verspieltem Charme. Strategen werden in NAUFRAGOS Knochen kotzen. Die Frage ist auch, ob einem das Spiel mittelfristig nicht langweilig wird, wenn man die Karten kennt. Spielzeit ist zu lang.

RATING: 2
The balance between attempting to escape the island and accumulating story points creates an interesting tension between players, as strictly selfish actions (cards that provide large numbers of story points and writing in one's journal) tend to only accumulate points and not avert the lose condition.
However, it is far too difficult to actually escape the island, especially because of how hard it is to reach the heart of the island through the encounter deck. Far too many dice rolls are necessary in optimal play for the game to not become a frustrating exercise in random chance-- even ignoring the varying value of story point tiles.
The encounter deck is interesting, though fiddly. The way cards are added to decks based upon encounters that occur in other parts of the island allows for a sense of cohesion between some events in the encounter deck. Unfortunately, handling the encounter deck as well as the encounters gets boring fast. Even if most of the events were not simply a die-roll or an optional die-roll, many of the follow-up events that occur are based upon one's reaction to the previous events, which, while mysterious the first time, will always yield the same result, siphoning away the game's replayability.
The English rulebook is awful by the way. I am still unsure if I resolve some of the events correctly.

I got the German first edition, but I didn't have as much trouble with the rules as other people seemed to have. 

Anyhow, I really like the game. Gameplay and theme match really well, components are alright and even though it plays in about 2 hours, it doesn't feel long to me.  

I think the exploration is a little weird. There are not enough cards that let you move forward, so you basically have to go through the entire pile to jump to the beginning of the next area if you want to make it to the top. 

Also, I find it unnecessary to play it as a semi-co-op game. My boyfriend and I agreed to skip the scoring at the end and just use the report chips for re-rolls. If we escape the island we win together and everybody is happy. Neither of us cares who 'has the better story to tell'. :)

Right now I'm not sure if I like this better than "Robinson Crusoe: Adventure on the Cursed Island" or not. They are both great games.

Loved the narrative of the game-play, not too difficult to win (with 2 characters at least), has a really good choose your own adventure feel.  Different from Robinson Crusoe, less puzzle more story-telling than that game.  I have not decided which I like better yet, but glad that I own both.

I understand semi-coop in some games with zero sum, like the zombie themed ones: it's me or the rest, there's no food or place for everyone in the colony, whatever.
But in a game where thematically you spend most of the time cooperating with the rest in a deserted island to start a fire, build a shelter, explore... and in the end you'll backstab them because only one player may win when you all get evacuated? Leave them to die is good for you? That makes little sense thematic-wise to me. Plus, there's actually very few decisions in the plot cards: it's always: roll a die, see what happens.
The rules are a bit of a mess, the decks are a pain to stack and setup.

In my opinion, this game tries to be several things at once (worker placement, thematic, semi-coop), and it doesn't fully achieve any of them. But it had real potential. A pity.

I think this game is better than Crusoe, no scenarios, each game is different. It is like a cross between Tales of Arabian nights and Crusoe. Good mix and good game.

I would have removed the "chronicle" thingy. My teeam of game designers testers find this game too random, but I think it's ok. I'm also lucky to have bought it at 30$ brand new too! :)

The game has a lot of replayability, and I hope the designers will come up with an expansion that adds more cards to the game. Cards that you can add randomly, especially in the middle and last deck of the island (as well as the main story deck and weather deck). No need for additional boards or complexity, just more cards and maybe characters too.

Thumbs up!

Joc semicoperatiu d'aventures amb elements d'eurogame. Afegeix una mecánica molt interesant de "Elige tu propia aventura", de manera que les decisions que prenen els jugadors van variant l'"argument" de la partida (afegint unes determinades cartes o unes altres a les baralles d'exploració).

Tot i això, el joc presenta un parell de problemas de difícil sol·lució:
- tot i ser semicooperatiu, el joc s'ha de jugar de forma cooperativa, ja que la dificultad és molt elevada. Això provoca que, si un jugador decideix mirar primer per el seu propi profit, la resta de jugadors han de fer el mateix i es torna impossible la victoria.
- el joc té el seu màxim interés en la "sorpresa" (objectes, cartes d'exploració, etc...), de manera que, en unes poques partides es perd aquest element sorpresa i el joc es torna una mica repetitiu.
- l'atzar és bastant determinant, no només en les tirades de daus, si no també en les cartes d'exploració.
- escala molt malament a menys de 3 jugadors, sent impossible la victoria en solitari, i molt complicada a 2 jugadors.

While thematic it feels the same as robinson crusoe, gameplay is a little bit different. adventuring is more like choose-your-own-adventure books which I like, but the goal is always the same: reaching the top of the hill.

Really needs some house rules to make it better. Most important is to advance one step in the Island Track every time you draw an Exploration Card and yet another step if there's a footprint on the card. This prevents the game from drag without sacrifying any aspect of the gameplay.

This game is a whole lot of fun.  the thematic text on the cards and the choices to do one of two things and then have a, b or c happen depending on the dice rolling is just so much fun. Then push your luck aspect to the explorations is where this game shines. the end points are stupid I we all ignored that part of the game.  This is game is what Lost Expedition or Friday  tried to be and failed miserably.  It is a very hard gaming experience that is also fun.

I was really looking forward to playing this one with other people after testing the game solo to get a handle on the rules.  I was not totally disappointed, but I do have some concerns.

We played with 4 players (the maximum allowable) and the game was unfortunately quite slow, this can be expected when 3 of the 4 players were new to it - but still it was a bit too long.  The slowness mainly stemmed from regular checks in the rule book to see if we could do certain things, or even simply how everyone's special character powers worked.  There are LOTS of holes in the rulebook, I'm really hoping the publisher posts an FAQ or updated rulebook soon because there were a few things we had to make house-rules for and I am not a fan of doing that.

Anyway, that aside - this isn't a bad game!  The cards are of an outstanding quality, the flavour text on every card is interesting, the events are meaningful and thematic, and the game chugs along nicely.  The act of exploring, where you turn over cards one at a time to resolve the next mini-adventure, is fun and everyone can get involved in the excitement.  The constant threat of running out of food or firewood keeps you from being to daring with the exploration, and it does encourage you to make some decisions together.

I am slightly skeptical about the semi-cooperative nature of the game, it seems that there is sometimes little incentive to really cooperate, but I suppose that's thematic and it makes the game cutthroat (in some respects) which will be a plus for many people.  This isn't a family game!

The rules (or lack thereof) may frustrate some people, but I'm confident I can get to grips with it now after one slow playthrough.  Again, I'm really impressed with the cards and the theme and I can heartily recommend it - particularly to fans of thematic games.  Don't get me wrong, however, there's plenty of "game" here to go along with the theme.

Not sure how replay could ever compare to Robinsion?  Also sounds too long, and maybe not polished enough

Edit - watched a gameplay video (thanks Radho!), kind of torn on this one (always was actually) but likely somewhere around 7 for me. For me its not the semi-coop nature that has me torn as I think I like that (something different), its more about I already own and really like Robinson, and they are very similar for sure.  

So it incorporates the best part of Tales of Arabian Nights, in that your choices effect and shape the overall developing story (maybe it just happens in ToAN not sure, here you can influence it somewhat), and the story that comes out is very rich and thematic. This largely happens in the exploring action, and it is the meat and most interesting part of the game (btw I think I like the card system better than books in ToAN or Smersh as I think they "interrupt" the game less). I think this is the only similarity to ToAN (never actually played it) here which for me is probably a good thing judging from what I know. There is a great push your luck element in the exploring, in a Diamant kind of way.  

The rest of the game is not as interesting in comparison, its standard WP stuff mostly, but you do have to make co-op decisions about what to do, they just aren't quite as interesting as Robby's decisions, and there is not the same tension from what I see. The other thing here that does stand out about it is the semi-coop aspect, and as Radho points out the game is not near as interesting if you remove this aspect and play full co-op as the decisions become even easier and there is even less tension (and apparently its too easy to win so needs tweaks to fix this)

The game looks to be too long for sure, blanking out some spots on the progression track looks easy enough to tweak, but I don't think its that easy here and not sure you can tweak it properly to keep the balance without playing or reading the rules. On the fence still, I'm tempted to add it if I get it cheap, there are a couple significant differences from Robby that I think I like, I am just lacking shelf space, want to play to fully decide (and I am trying to avoid buying 7's)

Interesting, fun. The semi-coop mechanism adds a nice bit of "me first!" thinking to the hivemind exercise that full coops can otherwise be. Castaways is very thematic, and mechanically simple.

The changes in the tempo of the game are a bit odd: Actions go quickly, but then someone goes off on an exploration adventure, and everyone else have to sit and wait for five minutes. Hmm...

Castaways is like two games bonded with super glue. One is a standard worker-placement game where food and supplies are gathered, shelters are built and constructs to help you get rescued are found or built. The other is a choose-your-own adventure type exploration game. Both parts are integral to winning. The worker-placement game must keep you alive while you explore to the heart of the island. If you don't get to the heart of the island, you can't win.

Sound a bit like Above and Below? It sure does. The main difference is that the stories in Castaways are driven by three decks of cards. As you have encounters and make choices in one deck, you add cards to future decks creating consequences that later come back to help or hurt you. Above and Below lacks any such continuity in the exploration, however the worker-placement side of the Ryan Laukat game is far more interesting than the pedestrian choices you face is Castaways.

In the end, the game runs about 3 hours, which is too long for the payoff. The worker placement actions are repetitive and, while necessary, are uninteresting. The story cards are fun and I love how the choices can play out, but there are not a lot of story paths and it would get predictable after a few games I imagine. Also, a big part of game play involves getting "story points" which determine a single winner among the survivors. It feels kind-of tacked on and at least in my group we largely ignored it, even though there are cards that can come into play that specifically allows players to fight for or steal points from one another. If the game was somehow designed to finish in 2 hours and the story points didn't feel so tacked-on to the core game play, I'd probably rate it higher.

Entertaining solo, good fun with 2; I'm interested to see how the experience improves with more players...

This is a very clever little game that I'm not sure is getting the attention it deserves. This likely has a lot to do with being overshadowed by Robinson Crusoe, with which it shares a common theme, and which came out about the same time. I can't compare the two, but I can state that taken on its own merits, Castaways is a very fun game.

The variable setup provides the initial story threads that, depending on your choices/luck, integrate new cards later into the game that extend the narrative. I love this mechanic. Having actions you take early in the game play out in different manners in the late game depending on how you responded. It helps you build a story that you are directly responsible for; if I threaten and scare the natives for their blowgun, they're going to come back later for revenge with poison darts... Great fun that feels similar to Tales of the Arabian Nights with the exception that you make the decisions, and you deal with the consequences.

With respect to replayability, there should be a fair amount thanks to the wealth of cards included. However, there is absolutely a finite number of times you will be surprised. Eventually you'll have seen an increasing number of the cards in previous games until the freshness wears thin. Additionally, you'll know which decisions to take in order to get you closer to the "best" outcome. The only recourse I can imagine is selling a complete replacement set for all the cards in the game for an entirely new experience. As such, it seems like expansions may not be in  the cards (har de har har). Again however, this might be a blessing in disguise. There's definitely enough legs here to provide enough entertaining plays to make the game well worth the cost.

Great game!! Much better than Robinson Crusoe.

Feels like you're lost in an island. It's like a role playing game.

RATING: 4
Sits at an uncomfortable position between a game and a storytelling experiences. The end result is it fails to satisfy either aspect due to limited storytelling with a lack of content, extra scenarios, and variation between outcomes (everything is roll 1-2 take an injury, 3-4 lose an energy/gain next to nothing, 5-6 awesome stuff!) It fails to satisfy its role as a game by having oversimplified mechanics supported entirely by random events. Do I work on this or this? either will get done eventually and provide us with either a bonus or a way to win. In the end, decisions are obvious and fail to bring about meaningful interaction.

Also let's get it out of the way: Semicoop doesn't work at all thematically or mechanically. No hidden information results in there being no complex decision making. It's all either clearly help the team or help yourself. Biggest D-bag or just the luckiest wins. If you're looking for Semi-coop, play Archipelago (I don't even like it much; it just does semi-coop better). Archipelago even has the island theme going for it!

Game length is an issue. It should be shorter. A lot shorter. 

Finally, let's not ignore the elephant in the room: Robinson Crusoe is a much better game in the same vein. This game's ultimate existence is unnecessary, except to take RC and make it lighter without reducing game length. As previously mentioned, the semi-coop "innovation" is a bust.

All in all, only play it if you know you're getting into something like Robinson Crusoe, but with inferior mechanics and severely limited replayability.

this game needs an expansion.  It is really fun, totally "choose your own adventure" style that I used to love in elementary school books.  It has a really fun feel to it.  The mechanics aren't really tight but it is a great way to spend an evening.  Just needs some new cards to boost replayability.  If there were about 40 new starting stories to the additional 20ish this game would boost up to an 8.5 for me.

Castaways is a competitive collaboration game about four castaways who are stranded on a small island. They must collaborate to improve their shelter, gather food to eat and wood to keep the campfire burning, and figure out how to advance to the interior of the island, as only from the vantage point of the highest spot on the island will they have a view of the vast ocean – and even more importantly, a view of the ship on the horizon that promises rescue! The players must manage their time in order to deliver a signal to this passing vessel – but even if they're all rescued, in the end only one player will win, that being the one who writes the best story at the end of the game, the one who lives and retells the greatest adventure from all the survivors, the one who has collected the most story points.

Naufragos ist ein "kooperatives" Spiel, bei dem am Ende doch nur einer gewinnt!
Wir sind gestrandet auf einer Insel und müssen diese durch Arbeiter-Einsatz erkunden, das Feuer in Gang halten, verschiedene Bauten bauen, die Siegrelevant sind und und und. Das ganze machen wir kooperativ, also zusammen. Für viele Dinge gibt es Logbucheinträge (Siegpunkte)... wer davon am meissten hat gewinnt.
Das ist das, was mich echt stört an dem Spiel. Ich bin erforschen gegangen, obwohl Charakter eines anderen Spielers das besser konnte und zwar nur, weil ich auf SP aus wahr. Logisch war das weniger... und verloren habe ich trotzdem, da die Siegpunktausschüttung (meines Empfindens nach) sehr zufällig war. Es gibt auch eine Aktion "passen", da bekomme ich random einen Siegpunktchip auf dessen Rückseite ein Wert steht...
Das Spiel gefällt mir dennoch, da es eine geile Story erzählt und dabei recht einfache Regeln hat.
Es gibt einen Kartenstapel mit nummerierten Karten. Wenn man nun ein Abenteuer erlebt und eine Entscheidung fällt (Klau den Einwohnern die Banane oder nicht), dann muss man entweder die eine oder die andere Karte aus dem Stapel suchen und in den Abenteuerkartenstapel mischen. Bedeutet dass sich die Einwohner zukünftig wieder melden und die Story sich weiterentwickelt.
Ich hatte eine Flaschenpost die ich weiter und weiterlesen konnte (z.B.).
Zu dritt ging mir das Spiel aber viel zu lange. Zu zweit kann ich es mir gut vorstellen, aber ein Solospiel würde ich sehr gerne mal versuchen.

RATING: 6
It was fun the first couple of times, but it missed the mark for me and felt under-developed.

The exploring action compared to the camp actions is unbalanced. Someone that explores could take a great deal of time going through several cards and interactions while someone who forages for food just grabs a tile and adds it to the storage unit.

Travelling and exploring up the mountain isn't fully developed because most of the time you can't get enough "foot" cards to move through a zone and have to exhaust the deck. So what's the point if there aren't enough of those cards to have it as a way of moving through an area?

If they were going to make it a semi-cooperative, I would have liked to see it take a more "survivor-the-reality-show" approach where you must form alliances but only one person can win so in the end you can only work with people so much.

The choose your own adventure part from the exploring action is quite fun but once again should have been implemented in a better way so that other players not exploring weren't sitting and watching others have all the fun.

Overall, enjoyed the games I played even if I felt the game is a missed an opportunity and eventually traded it away.

The game runs on the long side. Rules questions pop up all the time too, even after first time play.

Must play again - I rate this a 7.  It could be a 8, because I love the theme, mecanics, and story telling aspect of the game, but the cards are a bit cheap (black background that scratch easily) and it's freaking long (2h30 for a 2 player game without rules explanation).  Setup/teardown is long as well,as like many games that use various cards that needs to be shuffled/sorted.

Halfway through this one, I was over it entirely. I do not like the exploration mechanic (as anyone who doesn't go gets to sit out while the party, or one player) cycles cards endlessly. I also do not like the rule about the game ending as a victory only when the headland is reached and a combination of items is held by the group. Finally, the lost mechanic is baffling; no penalty for getting lost? No secret deck of outcomes? This one just didn't do this one for me.

Positives:
- Solid gameplay
- Some interesting cards and options
- Does many things better than Robinson
- New cards getting added to the game based on previous events is pretty cool

Negatives:
- Semi-co-operative aspect is flawed by design because it leads to unnecessary conflict between players (in a bad way)
- Some characters like the Fisherman are terrible because you are pretty much forced to go fishing every turn while watching the Explorer do all the fun stuff like exploring
- Dice

Fun,    Players create great stories along the way… very thematic. In the end, players want to stand out in the story of their adventure, creating competitive aspect that is interesting, but still need to act cooperatively to survive and endure.

Only 1 play with my son.  The first thing to note is that this is a "STORY" game.  I feel like I am playing through an adventure story and can't wait to see what unfolds on the next page.  The game play is not too deep, but it is FUN and challenging.  There is a push your luck aspect (FUN) with exploring the island.

If I was playing competitively (instead of just co-op with my son), there is an interesting decision between the selfish "I need to get Story Points" aspect, that you need to weigh against doing the best thing for the group to improve chances of getting off the island.  But to be honest, it seems to me the Story Points are irrelevant (outside of using them for dice re-rolls) your first couple of plays, because the game is tough.  You really need to approach it with a co-op instead of a "semi co-op" mentality to have a glimmer of hope to get rescued.

Like others have noted, your 1st game will be 3-4 hours.  So make sure you have the proper amount of time set aside.  After a couple of plays I can see this time dropping to 2-3 hours.  I don't have a problem with the time if it is an enjoyable experience.  It seems that the game "MAY" not be that replayable due to seeing the same cards over and over.  But that wouldn't be a problem for at least a dozen plays, as you will only see a subset (about 10-20) of the 127 plot cards each game, and the card combos will vary.

Comparisons with Robinson Crusoe (which I've only played twice).  Castaways is easier to play, and tells a "richer" STORY (IMHO) than Robinson Crusoe.  Robinson Crusoe (I think) has a wider range of decisions and possible outcomes.  Robinson Crusoe is more complex and is more of a gamers game.  For me, this takes some of the fun out of the game.  Castaways feels more like taking part in an adventure story/movie, the decisions are more straightforward, and IMHO is better suited to be a FAMILY game.  I'm not going to say which one is better, because I haven't played either enough.  As of now, I'm happy with my purchase of Castaways.

Castaways falls between being a story game and being a gamer's game.

It won't be challenging for a true gamer and it has a repetitive story mechanic which makes each game feel the same.

There are some cool mechanics but they do not integrate well enough to be interesting after a few plays.

A gamer should beat the game in the first try if the adventuring mechanics are understood. After this it should be a breeze.

If it is a challenge that you want, consider Robinson Crusoe. If it is story that you want, consider Tales of the Arabian Nights.

I am underwhelmed by the semi-co-op thing. It leaves a bad taste in your mouth when the game is over. But if fighting with your friends and family is what you want, pick this one up and don't try to win just have fun annoying each other.

A very pleasant and immersive semi-coop game which plays solo very well, also (although losing some tension due to the lack of competitiveness). An "experience game" in which often winning or losing is not as important as the experience of struggling for survival and discussing with your teammates. Due to the "surprise" effect of some storylines in the cards, it's better to spread out your plays in time if you usually play with the same teammates so nobody remembers exactly which cards have those nasty/great effects.

I'm not sure what game I'm rating here; it's some heretofore undiscovered variant of Castaways based upon misunderstood setup, misunderstood mechanics, and misunderstood game ending conditions.

This game has great ideas and mechanics. 

It's a nice thematic game, it creates and develops very nice stories, but strategy wise, it's an overtly simple game, there are no grand decisions, everything is pretty obvious, and it's the cards and not the players who dictates what happens.

-> I don't enjoy the ambient it creates: everybody distrusting everybody, negotiating about everything...
-> It's anti-theme: castways caring about who's going to become famous more than about saving themselves?
-> It's very long, even more long considering the few things you actually do.
-> The only really interesting and original thing is the exploration; players not doing exploration will have to wait quite a lot until their next turn.
-> Replayability is in question once you get to know the cards and the story arcs.
-> The components are just OK (cheap plastic?), but the art and the design are nice. The price is great.

Semi coops just don't work, and it doesn't here either. The moment one player does something aimed at winning the game individually over helping create the winning condition, then all players effectively get permission to act selfishly instead of selflessly, dooming everyone to a loss. It needs a topmost player loses type thing. The game is too easy to find a perfect path as a straight co-op (where if you win, you can combine your scores to compare to your previous group best) so that doesn't work long-term either. There's the normal worker placement aspects - get food, wood, build shelters, etc. Whereas Robinson Crusoe tried to add fun and theme into the flipping of cards when you tried to do this stuff, Castaways makes action resolution pretty cut-and-dried and chooses to add its fun by having the players go off and do exploration instead of hunting and gathering. And the exploration bit has all the card flipping theme. Much the same experience therefore, but adding more surety on action success meant we found it less frustrating than Robinson Crusoe and more fun. Even if it was substantially longer, which is a downside. I want it playable because of the theme, just not sure how to fix it for our group yet.

Neat semi-coop adventure. 2+ hour game. Tough game with lots of choices. Good pieces. Good graphics. Neat ideas. Okay feel to the gameplay and theme. I enjoy the semi-coop aspect. Too long for what it is.

Regarding English 2nd Ed. - Warning:
- Rulebook is a mess.
- Fiddly to learn.
- Many questions will arise about cards due to poor wording.
- A FAQ is ongoing, but is incomplete.
- Some cards were cut incorrectly.
- 2 boards go side-by-side to form 1 larger board (sigh). - Don't bump your table because cubes love to slide around on cards and lose their places. 
- Nail down the difference between "Storage" and (forage) "Supply", because confusion is eminent.

Great fun on first playthrough (2 players). Loved the exploration and adventure, can't wait to see more of this. Maybe we were lucky, but we did manage to fairly comfortably escape the island - no traumas, whilst building almost all available structures. However looking forward to more of a challenge, and seeing its more competitive semi-cooperative side when playing with 1 or 2 more players.

Really good game, with lots of planning to do. Kind of like those "make your own story" books, but for a group. Still on the fence about getting a copy or not, but will definitely play it whenever the chance presents itself.

RATING: 9
The moulded pieces i.e. wood and drumsticks plus the artwork seems more evocative than Robinson Crusoe, plus the bookkeeping seems more fluid and evocative; however the exploration phase of pushing your luck bloats your turn and playing time, so maybe by too much to be entertaining for other players; I now strongly convinced this is only best as a solo venture, besides there seems to be some backstabbing. I also like the deck building/card exchange narrative.

This game tries to be semi-cooperative and fails. The idea is all players have to accomplish certain things in order for everyone to be saved. What they need to accomplish is semi-random as it is determined by random card draw, but the faster you act, the more chances you get for that random draw. The problem is that as you play, players can collect points, and if everyone is rescued then whoever has the most points wins. All the surefire ways of getting these points produce nothing towards the goal of being rescued, which means if you are trying to win, you are essentially making it more likely everyone will lose. If you only try to get rescued, the player who took the points action one more time than you will just win. That's of course an exaggeration, since the points are face down tokens ranging from 1-4, so really, nobody has any idea what's going on in terms of the points. The plot of the game is pretty nice, it works off these card decks that call each other to the deck when you resolve them. There is a high degree of re-playability here in terms of the plot alone. Overall, if you are willing to ignore points entirely, this game is good, but not as good as Robinson Crusoe: Adventure on the Cursed Island.

Like most semi-cooperative games, this rides a fine line of wonderful suspense and being nearly unplayable. It's easy for things to go haywire if players aren't 100% sure what it takes to survive, or if they even care to survive. Castaways is brimming with theme and sports an impressive exploration mechanic. I really did feel like a castaway. That being said, the objectives aren't always clear and things get hopeless pretty fast after tiny mistakes. Not necessarily stressful in a good way. Overall, I just kept asking myself why I would return to this island when Robinson Crusoe handles the same theme perfectly already.

This is a tough solo game and the rules are quite vague in numerous places.  I kind of liked the story that was building but I died so early I just don't think I really got the feel of the game.  The directions were just very frustrating for a game that seems pretty straight forward.  

Update:
After watching a few videos I think I've got this one down.  Really hard as a solo and the instructions indicate this.  However, my second adventure was just that, an adventure.  I had many encounters: had a goat and milked it for food-well, until and I ate it and a dog lead me home and then I ate it.  I lost still but had good progress on goals of the game but just ran out of time.  

It's die roll heavy so there are many opportunities to earn re-rolls.  The story builds like a choose-your-own-adventure book.  You add cards to the decks often when you make various choices.  Pretty fun adventure game and I might try playing with 2 or 3 characters and giving it a try as there isn't a ton of character management so would be pretty easy.  

My biggest knock might be that there isn't enough re-playability because the script plays similar. I suppose time will tell.  An expansion with different island starting cards might help with this if it is a problem.  It's just speculation at this time.  Fun game.

After 1 full playthrough: Like the game a lot. Mechanics work although some cards / rules aren't as clear as you would want them to be. Only played it full co-op until now but I already see how the semi-coop aspect would make the game a lot more tense and maybe more enjoyable. I don't see however how the players would ever get off the island in semi-coop!

Attention: If you look for a cooperative game and want to play Naufragos as coop, don't do that. I believe it's way to easy to be played as a coop. But this is imho what makes this game great - the semi-coop works absolutely perfect. You are always struggling between "should I help the team" or "should I help myself", adding in the adventure cards, this game is a lot of fun.
I only fear that once you know all the cards, the game will be a bit less interesting.

Несмотря на то, что основной механикой в игре является нелюбимый мною "миплплэйсмент", атмосферность превалирует над происходящим действом всю дорогу. Играть интересно, но реиграбельность явно невелика. В этом смысле напрашивается аналогия с Рунебоундом, где кол-во карт в основных колодах определяет данный показатель, так как за партию через руки игроков проходит почти 100% карт. Здесь конечно эта цифра несколько меньше, за счет сюжетной колоды, но всё таки. Аналогии с Рунебоундом также напрашиваются по обилию художественного текста на картах. Уровень сложности лучше сразу выбрать повыше, так как на стандартном (с реролами) пройти игру не так сложно.

I had to double-check when Robinson Crusoe came out (a year before this game) because this game clearly "borrows" a lot from Robinson Crusoe but tries to set itself aside by being a semi-cooperative experience.

Right away, semi-coops suck for the most part.  The only one that has done it passably has been Cutthroat Caverns.  With something like this where you have to work together or you all lose and then if you don't all lose you score points to check for a winner, it just doesn't work.  The game is too difficult to not work together which makes the whole semi-coop layer feel kind of worthless and if you really did compete with each other to a higher degree you would either all just lose or players that knew they didn't have a chance at winning could just derail it for everyone.  What's the difference to them between them losing or everyone losing after all?  We ended up resorting to playing much like we play Legendary, even though it is meant to check for score and award a winner we play it pretty much purely coop.  But the problem with that is this game is just a worse Robinson Crusoe at that point.

To be more clear the game is a (semi-) coop game where players are stranded on a desert island and have to take actions each turn to acquire food and wood to not starve, build shelter, craft items for survival, and build items like rock signs and signal fires to be rescued.  Along with this is an adventure piece where you draw cards that have a wide variety of effects and usually have you put a different unread card back in the deck to encounter later based on the previous card drawn.  For example (minor spoiler ahead) killing some piglets for food has you shuffle an unknown card into the deck that later turns out to be an angry mother boar that will attack you.  This piece is kinda fun and I would have liked it...again, if Robinson Crusoe didn't already do it in a much, much better way.

Semi-coops are terrible 99% of the time and this one falls into that majority.  If you play this purely coop it is just a worse Robinson Crusoe.

RATING: 6.5
Fun game that is similar to Robinson Crusoe. I like/dislike the whole competitive nature of the co-op game though. Wish it was re-designed without it, since removing it takes some of the interesting elements out. However, one big complaint is how you finish the game by exploring the whole island. The "footstep" icons to progress on the path are fairly rare and if multiple people explore and divide up the steps then the only way to advance is to finish the entire deck. This seems kind of weird and we had to go through all 3 decks because we were no where near finishing otherwise.

Our story was a 4-player game where we all had female characters. We started roleplaying our characters up and acting all nice like a bunch of stereotypical women would act. Encouraging each other when we failed (like when Greg's character didn't start the fire on the first turn on a 1 to 4 roll). As time went on though this changed and the competitive nature of the game came out -- especially after I had convinced my allies to give me the Gold Chest (worth 8 VP) so that I could spend my VP tokens on other things. I was the amateur hunter and always went adventuring and scouting for good loot. Managed to get a Gunpowder Barrel and a Machete early on. Found a dog (who I named "Billy") along the way and everything was working out. However, things turned towards the end with Dennis stole my treasure and refused to heal me because it would cost him 5 VP. Granted, we were close to winning so it is something I probably would have done myself. 

I sacrificed my Gunpowder Barrel (worth 5 VP) to blow up the fish and get a ton of food because we were hurting to survive (I probably should have let them all starve since I had found food on my adventures).

The story unfolded that we found some slave ship and escaped slaves managed to make it all the way to the end of the island (they were the last card in the deck). A long the way we encountered a ton of animals (boars, jaguars, birds and their eggs).

Eventually we managed to get off the island by burning through all 3 decks and I just barely survived. However, Greg managed to get a ton of 4 VP chips during the game and just squeak out a win over Dennis who stole my treasure. I would have won if I still had my precious booty -- that damn bitch stole it! =)

Has a lot of similarities with Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island, but still enough to be a different and good game - not just another rip-off. I think that Robinson Crusoe is the better game, with the many different adventures, which Castaways doesn't have, but more plays of both games will tell.

Second game - lowered my rating to 7, from 8. Last time, we all played much more co-op than second, and we got busted by playing way to self-centred. The only thing, that made this game feel different, was the change in the style of our play.

Castaways delivered one of the most memorable and entertaining plays I have had in a long time, but I don't know how repeatable it would be. We had a huge amount of fun squabbling over who was going to help us survive and who was off after their own objectives. The game, though long and complicated (set up was a nightmare) was always interesting and entertaining.

Robinson Crusoe, but with added dicking over. A huge amount of fun.

I'd played a prototype version years ago (literally, about 4 years ago) and was glad to see that the published edition lived up to that original promise.

Interesting tension and the evolving nastiness of the plot is fairly well-done, but it's way too long and in some ways pretty broken.

This game is pretty freaking brutal. No need to have the competitive element in the game as 9 times out of 10 you won't survive the game. Enjoyed dying and struggling in this game. While reminded of Robinson Crusoe, this game is it's own beast and would gladly play either.

Very good, fun, but long, semi co-op with emphasis on semi as players compete to get the best story to tell if they escape from the island. Much simpler to learn and teach than the similar Robinson Crusoe without losing much, if any, of the gameplay and with much less of an alpha-player problem and with stronger storytelling.

The only disadvantage compared to Robinson Crusoe may be less replayability with no expansions released for Castaways, so it may not hold up to heavy daily/weekly play but there are plenty of story arcs for occasional play.

Recommended house rule: Semi co-ops typically suffer from 'it is better to all lose than let someone win, so I will just sabotage the game if I cannot win' mentality. But this is easily and interestingly resolved by reversing the Story Points (VPs) so that the (least selfish) player with the fewest Story Points wins if you fail to escape. This adds interesting decisions to not get too far ahead during the game, and towards the end to judge if you will succeed or not and if not to burn your Story Points on re-rolls.

It's a long game (2-4 hours per game) but it's also a great gaming experience. Something different, a pseudo-eurogame full of theme. The game is in the plot cards and the cooperative aspect until it's more or less clear that you're going to get out of the island. In that moment is when coop turns into selfish. And when someone gets the ink too, of course. First try to survive, then try to win.

Despite all the hype, I prefer Castaways to Robinson Crusoe (or Friday for that matter).  I really like how playing one exploration card can often lead to a chain of other related events that allow a story to progress in a logical manner.  The game has tons of theme and is very true to its source.  One downside is that once you know all the story cards, some of the excitement of exploring decreases.

My main complaint with Robinson Crusoe was that it was so hard, punishing, and resource constrained that is simply was not that much fun to play.  Castaways is definitely easier to win, but I found it more fun to play too.  It was also not as fiddly as RC.

The discovery parts feels like a different game: every other action is "put a meeple, do one thing", the discovery is "take a card, do something, repeat" 10 times or more if you don't care about getting back soon. Being in the jungle also seems easier to survive.
I think going on discovery with multiple people is always badly played: The advantages of having more energy to expend is more than offset by the bad stuff happening to all explorers.

A giant hit with my 8 year old.  My husband and I have played with him on most of the logged games, and this has been a fantastic family experience.  We even played a simplified version with the 5 year old once.

The problem: we're getting really good, and always win.  Often without needing any healing surges at all.  We don't mind always winning, since it's the adventure that we enjoy, but would love to be able to level up the characters and have new level 2 or 3 scenarios.

Cooperative dungeon explorer with a great emphasis on the unknown and the random as the dungeon is revealed tile by tile as you play...
1st of the D&D Board Game...

-1 For weird mechanic that make a specific hero 'own' a specific monster. Can be confusing at time, when 2 or 3 monsters of the same type are in play at the same time...
-1 Because some thing are not well explained, like which dungeon tiles are considered standard and which are considered specific to an Adventure... Hint: Read each Adventures and remove tiles with a specific name, these are Special Adventure tiles...

RATING: 8
Lots of fun for a D&D-lite experience.

It's not the deepest, nor the most tactical game on the market, but for those with a limited amount of time for gaming who are looking to scratch that D&D itch, look no further than Castle Ravenloft.

Those looking for something a lot more epic, with sprawling campaigns and persistent RPG choices and experiences need not apply.

The hardcore will be disappointed.

But for the casual gamers our there, this should be a staple in your collection of dungeon crawlers.

Really enjoyed this system...was a bit meh about the Dragon one when I played it a few years ago, but at that time I was having to go through long 2-3 hours combats in 4E.  

As a board game, the system works awesome.  I now want all of these--I wish the actual RPG had as good combat pacing as these boardgames.

First impression: No chance to play yet but it's hard to believe how much stuff is packed into the box. The box must be 6-7 inches in height and it needs that depth with all the cards, counters, puzzle boards, and plastic minis included. It's like a whole Christmas in a box!

Second impression: Well I played the first solo adventure and it was very intense (and fun!). Got at least one rule wrong which probably cost me the game. There are some vagaries in the rules that need to be addressed but not so many that a small FAQ couldn't resolve.

Final impression: too light for me. There's not enough hard choices and the system tends to play itself. Production values are outstanding but the game system is very much a novice level. (Sold it)

A birthday gift from a friend. My best friend in fact! I really like this game a lot. There are some things I don't like about it as well, for instance I think they could have done better on the tile art, and the AI would be better if it could be replaced by a DM type figure (sort of like in Descent, but a neutral force to keep it in line with D&D). That being said, the game is fun and I have enjoyed painting the miniatures (which I never would have done if not for CR)

Simple and streamlined "role playing/board game" crossover. Modular board and nice sculpts. When played as a coop game (which is really what it IS at its heart) with the kids, it's a real hit. A nice introduction to the RPG for those who don't know or understand the genre.

RATING: 1
just the badest game i play this year 
 not even a light dungeon crawl , just a dungeon genrator, with. with strictly no strategy, no game , no play, the only thing you d it's take card and roll dice, there is no way of predict anything , so your win or lose depend only of random. 
the only thing it's like the game don't let you roll enough dice to staticaly lose , you're always lose or die on the 3 or fourth last tiles 

no interst at all 

by lowered yout stat , you can even start the game on the 3 our fourth last tile, like the first part of the game have only function to lowered your capacity before the las boss fight withoout kill you

My first dungeon crawler. Good as a primer for D&D4E.

I bought this when I was playing 4th Edition D&D heavily. The Adventure system would make a great primer for the RPG, which is pretty moot now that it is moving to 5th edition. 

The game itself is pretty rough. It punishes you for exploring. It punishes you for not exploring. Wave after wave of minions will beat you down on your way to fight a boss who will most likely kill you. Advancement options are a bit underwhelming when compared to others in the genre. 

I think Runebound is better for an RPG fix, and dungeon run better for dude in a dungeon fix.

It's a decent dungeon crawl game and fairly difficult. I can imagine that some people won't like the fact that you'll basically be attacked each round (from the newly drawn monster if you exposed a new tile or from the environment if you choose not to expose a new tile). Still, if you like PnP D&D, it's worth a try.

Wife was surprised how much she loved these D&D games. Nothing deep about them, but its just fun to roll some dice and kill some monsters sometimes. Great for when you don't want to have to think too hard, but you want something more substantial than a little filler.

Game is a little meh, but parts are super nice.

More a coop than a dungeon crawl.  You tend to get beat up and barely survive versus being somewhat powerful and growing stronger as the games progress.

I never got to make a meaningful decision during the game. Move to the edge of a tile, get attacked, draw another encounter, wait for your team to move and attack and hope there still is a target when your turn gets round. The map did not seem to add anything to the game, there is no importance to positionally, since the monsters automatically move next to you anyway. We could have simply played from a deck of cards.

RATING: 5
One of those love or hate games. For me, its more of a hate type.

The rules are very condensed and simplified till the rules make no sense. You will find, the identification of tokens are not clear, the monsters gives no 'power' difference in terms of which monster is better than others. (Important, as there are cards that 'forces' you to choose the stronger monster....how do you define that?)

The monster cards are not well defined as 'miss damage' are not clear. Treasure cards should state when a card should/could be played. Common sense does not equate correct usage of card effects and timings. Looks like lots of FAQ to come.

Player movement causing exploration is an invitation to being hit first by monsters even before you can retaliate.

Monster movement defines tiles....so where do they land? Which Square? its immportant as this landing-square causes other players to determine where they can or cannot go.

As some plus points. Miniatures are reasonably nice. Losy plastics used. Fast combat resolution. Few-er cards than standard dungeon crawl games, as there are no weapons/armour/spell cards besides those you start with.

Overall, a simple game, badly supported by the rule booklet. Can never be on the same level as Descent. Lacked excitement playing the game. Plain average, nearer to plain boring.

This game is superb. I'd been putting off buying it thinking it was too much like D&D 4E (an edition I don't personally care for), but it turns out that when taken as a board game, it's simply amazing.

And it's great that my Dungeon Command monsters can be used with this game, too.

I love this game ! I don't have time for real D&D anymore, but this is a lot of fun and can be played solitaire which is a real plus for me. It isn't perfect but what is here is WONDERFUL, expandable and best of all plays quickly enough for you to think of "oh, just one more...!" Looking forward to getting the next game in the series...

RATING: 8
This is by far the best of the 'intro to D&D' boardgames that have come out over the years. I know, not really saying much since most of those were pretty bad but it's pretty clear that's the market WotC has aimed this product at. This is not a RPG however. It is also not an in-depth dungeon crawl either so it's not to be compared to Descent or other similar games with more depth. 

The game is a light, team based tactical combat game set in the D&D 4e world. The rules are pretty simple and easy to understand. I've seen a lot of complaining about the rules and I really just don't understand where it all comes from. I can only imagine it comes from those that are used to having every little detail spelled out for them. The rules are designed to be light and quick to pick up. Just keep in mind that if it doesn't say you can't do it then it's allowed. In keeping with the light nature of the game, the playing time is fairly short. The hour listed on the box is pushing it a bit though. It does depend on the number of characters you have in play. I'd say on average you'll finish in 1 hr. + 15 minutes per character. 

The components are excellent. All the minis are unpainted sculpts from the D&D 4e minis line. The tiles and counters are all thick cardboard similar to what you get in Descent. The cards are nice. Nothing incredible but what I would expect from a game like this. And everything fits back in the box nicely. The insert is one of the better ones I've seen recently and easily accommodates everything that comes with the game. Just be sure to NOT throw out the cardboard backing after you punch the game. You need to save some of those to raise the storage insert up to the lip of the box bottom. This is nicely explained in the rules. 

There are 13 adventures in the game. But unlike similar games there is a good deal of replayability in each adventure. Because the map tiles are random as are the monster, treasure and encounter cards you can get wildly varying play with the same adventure. Each character also has customizable abilities or powers. Abilities which might work in one adventure might not work as well in others so the selection of these powers is important. I've been challenged with each adventure. The tactical situations are best described as puzzles that the players have to solve as a group. The monsters and villains are well tested since they are pulled from D&D 4e. The programable nature of the monsters works very well and it is fun to puzzle through how to defeat them. 

Overall, I think this is a solid game for a lighter dungeon crawl. The rules are short and easily explainable. And the playing time is fairly short for this type of game. The game also is great for families. The age on the box is 12+ and I can see how that might be the case if a group of kids were to play. But when played with a parent the game could easily accommodate younger kids. In that case I'd say you could easily get kids in the 8-10 yr. old range to play with a good level of autonomy.

I'm big into D&D, but for some reason, these games are just ok for me.  Maybe I haven't played with the right group.  I'll never get rid of this, however, even thought the box is huge.  The minis alone are too cool to give up.

“Plays like D&D 4th edition. Easier than Descent.”  New for 2010. Definitely easier than Descent.  Easy enough to teach others.  Gives a D&D type feel, but along the lines of edition 4e play. Meh.  It would be okay for a quick D&D fix, but it's doubtful I'll pull it out for play again.

I really enjoy dungeon crawlers as a genre. I had high hopes for a Dungeons and Dragons themed game even though all my experience with Wizard's published games screamed "don't get your hopes up!". I should've listened to my instincts. Don't get me wrong, there's definitely a diamond in this very very rough, but it would require repurposing many of the components for a much better custom game. And speaking of the components...

I'm a tactile person. I enjoy having nice pieces (minis, where appropriate, are a plus!). But Castle Ravenloft's graphical design is just bland and boring. I literally could not prevent myself from yawning every time I saw the cards and tiles in the game. Each of them seem to be designed like bland corporate brochures with one color, up to two flat shades of that color, and white+black. That's it. The "art" on the cards consists of monochrome sketches. Instead of eye-grabbing icons for things like "Immobilized", instead we're treated to just the word itself with really badly done generic token backgrounds. I can't emphasize enough how every tile and card is just a generic texture plus a word. It felt like I was playing a prototype for an unpublished game right down to the rules that clearly need tweaking. On the other hand, the minis are excellent. 

The game's actual rules fall really flat. Most of the decisions they made don't make any sense in the context of the game and it slowly reveals how untested it feels. Most of the time, half the party will be stuck on level 1 for the entire adventure due to a really stupid rule that requires rolling a nat 20 (which you only really do in combat) by that character while you have 5 experience. Afterward, you can't ever level again. That doesn't feel very D&D at all. That's just like if someone knew the general premise of D&D but couldn't be bothered to balance the game properly. It keeps all the boring parts of the TTRPG: Armor class, healing surges, daily powers, a single level. Without adding any of the good stuff.

Each adventure feels almost the exact same, even moreso than Descent 2e did. Move onto tile, fight whatever's there, reveal monster/encounter, get suckerpunched (EVERY GODDAMN TURN) and repeat for EACH player's turn. I understand this was to scale the game's difficulty by player but it really means there's no teamwork. Every player just hits whatever's closest to them and splitting up actually stops the party from dying as fast since too many encounters hit every hero on one tile. It's seriously the best and only way to play. After you learn that extremely basic tactic, the only remaining gameplay feature is the pure ass-chapping randomness. Dungeon crawlers need to be random because it adds variance and replayability. Castle Ravenloft on the other hand will eat up all that variance in one adventure. The game is just too random and you experience a slew of never-ending bullshit on a constant basis. We won our adventures but it wasn't very fun or strategic. It was the same tactic of figuring out how to get close and rip into 1-3 HP as fast as possible every turn. The fact that monsters move based on hero turns was very confusing and difficult to keep track of once things got moving. Multiple times, that rule felt like it was written incorrectly and slowed the game down tremendously. There's better ways to balance based on how many players are in the game.

And the SUCKER PUNCHING. Jesus christ not a single monster we encountered just spawns and sets something up. Every single one of them spawns, moves an entire tile to a hero, and slams them with their best attack instantly. You'd think heroes would learn eventually to guard after an encounter.

Overall, this game plays like it was designed by a corporate publisher: soulless, vapid, shallow, and yawn-inducing. Only reserve for game nights where you have 45 minutes to kill and want to go to bed after.

As a fan of dungeon crawlers, and adventure games in general, Castle Ravenloft is my current favorite. It combines nice bits (but not the nicest) with good mechanics (but not the most original) in a reasonable playing time (close to the fastest) that equals the most fun per hour that you can have in this genre. The adventures in the book showcase the versatility of the system. Endlessly expandable. Looking forward to the next play session and WoA, the next game in the series.

Very slow and dragging. The consistency of difficulty seemed all over the place in the first campaign/mission. Maybe I'm just not meant for the RPG-style, maybe I need to try it again, or maybe I don't like dungeon-crawls, but I was booored.

RATING: 7.5
Solid dungeon game. Very clever and easy rules. Plays fast with lots of fights and a system that pushes you hard to keep on moving. This serves as a timer that brings every scenario straight to the conclusion. It never bogs down. I did not like it at first, but now i enjoy it a lot. It scales to the number of characters you wanna play, without fiddling special rules. A fun power crawl.

While I have read all the complains and comments on the game I can't help but disagree with most of them. I find this game perfect for when I need a Dungeon Crawler fix without the massive amount of effort and time needed for other crawlers. Sometimes I don't want to play a game for 4 or 5 hours leveling up my characters while my friend is a overlord. Sometimes I want to hack and slash my way to glory and fun.

RATING: 5
Too simplified for it's own good.
What could have been a fun fast dungeon crawler ends up as 20 minutes fun and 40 minutes boredom.
Also a visual letdown, with generally bland artwork on the tiles and no pictures on neither treasure cards nor encounter cards, who actually make up the majority of the 200+ cards!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Customisation - lots of options available through official and community created content including: plethora of scenarios, custom campaigns with new heroes and even changed gameplay mechanics to include proper leveling. Now I'm not someone who wants to customise their game (outside of sleeves and plano boxes) as I prefer to play vanilla or with official expansions, so I attribute this as the 2nd biggest reason I'm getting rid of them. If you love customising games and using lots of variants with PnP stuff then this may be for you!

Components - Top notch, card stock is good along with the quality of the tiles, love how they lock into each other. The insert is actually quite usable even though I opted for deck boxes and planos  You'll be getting your monies worth in terms of box contents.

Minis! - This gets it's own category! When I first started collecting boardgames I originally wanted games with Mini's and games like Mage Knight seemed so abstract and hard to grasp with it's coloured tokens. I also had plans to paint them which lasted for about 10mins after I got them home. Now that I owned and have played a few more games I've noticed that a lot of games substitute mini's to hide shallow mechanics and unfortunately I feel these games are that, plus I have no issues anymore believing my purple wooden token is a dog! cool

Gameplay - I love complex games but also really simple games like PAGC, Elder Sign and Dungeon Roll... But the D&D Adventure Games were just a chore to play, for the setup time and length of gameplay I really felt like I was just going through the motions to finish the game in order to say I'd done another playthrough and I tend to enjoy longer games like Robinson Crusoe and Mage Knight. Rolling a single D20 is also a bit of a bummer and I like ideas where people have instead used 2x D10's.
Mechanics are too predictable (i.e. A monster WILL spawn if you encounter a new tile) and takes away immersion from the game, games like Galaxy Defenders and Gears of War have similar mechanics but still maintain some unknown elements in them that keep the game fresh and fun (I don't own either but have played them). I also thought about keeping this game to play with my wife/friends but even they were bored with the game after a very short time.

Theme - This was the biggest reason for me to ditch them! For me as Theme can make or break a game for me in terms of creativity and imagination. I had real troubles getting immersed in these games and letting my creativity take over. I felt the theme just wasn't there or at least kept pulling me out, aside from the mini's everything else just seemed... lifeless. 
The tiles themselves are good but all very samey with not too much difference. The cards were the worst bit, very little art or style, the font was bad and I haven't seen many people comment about it but for me the font was the biggest immersion breaker. I'm not looking for cursive text or an aged scroll to read off but at least choose something less... sterile and office like. Theme is one of the main reasons I enjoy Mice and Mystics, if the theme wasn't there on that game I'd probably have the same opinion as I have here. Some of the tokens were also just a coloured background with plain font text saying what it was which just seemed lazy if they were able to print proper art on other tokens. 

Support - I really felt WoTC let the whole team down on this one, they virtually copy pasted their games after Ravenloft

It feels boring, which is a bad thing for a dungeon crawl. Nice minis, but the map is pretty generic, the rulebook is frustratingly vague, and the monsters are uninspired.

So far, I don't find it really works either in gameplay or theme terms. There is not really much in the way of interesting strategy or tactics. That wouldn't matter to me if the gameplay meshed well with an immersive theme. And it's almost there: really nice miniatures and so on. But the game pushes you towards exploring fast, even when thematically that seems wrong. It pushes you towards keeping your party spaced out. You have to linger by an unexplored area and, every time, you are pounced on by a monster who surprises you. The lovely monster miniatures aren't usually the biggest threat, rather the encounter cards. There isn't enough variety in the rooms or what happens when you explore. I'd prefer more variety between character classes. I really think a few changes to the rules could rescue this, but I'm not sure if I'm going to get round to trying this out.

Traded away for £25 in Maths trade.

Although it's not my type of game, from all the games of its kind/family, this seems like one of the good ones. 

The monsters are quite balanced, the interaction between players more often than in Mansions of Madness and the extra comes from the quality of the miniatures - they really rock.

A coop dungeon crawl game with easy-to-learn rules. Playing time is around 60 minutes per scenario (at least for the first few scenarios). The game lacks a bit of the unpredictability that comes with a dungeon master, but it delivers an enjoyable gaming experience overall.

RATING: 2
Gorgeous component, enormous potential, and totally failed game. Boring to death, crippled, and again boring. 
How can a game with such potential be so bad? That i am still trying to understand.

Why are those wonderful tokens being unused? Why are those gorgeous monsters all the same? Why are those AI cards all identical (rush and hurt)? Why are those "treasures" almost feel as a punitive measure? Why is the turn so more scripted? Why are those tiles all completely useless? There's a grid but monsters move by TILES. What horrible idea is that? 
So much questions...

Basic turn: you move, you hit the monster (usually, there's only one monster on the board at a time), you chose to discover and get hit by a random encounter or be hit by a random encounter. Then you turn stop. You get hit by the new monster that appears exactly the same place on the new tile, it hits you without any way to prevent it, and then it's the other player turn. Then you move, you hit, and you discover. You get hit by the event, hit by the monster, and then you move......

A funny co-op dungeon crawler, with easy but often confusing rules, set in the fascinating Castle Ravenloft Campaign Setting. With a little of tweak this is a very intereseting boardgame (sure that WoA, his twin game, will improve it a lot)

I still haven't come to terms with this "dungeon crawler", or more precisely with the underlying "adventure system" mechanic of all of its brethren. Need to give it some more spins, I guess. So far I am not very thrilled.

While being a old school D&D-RP veteran, this game got me, and some of my 'non-believer friends' around the kitchen table and enjoy a part of the experience of a full fledged fantasy roleplaying campagne. We got through most of the scenario's within an hour, which is excellent I think. The number of player scaling difficulty system is great. Compared to the other installments of the series ([GAMEID=66356] and [GAMEID=91872]) the heroes feel somewhat weaker though. 

For my fellow Dutch Geekers I've included a review video of me and my friends playing the game: [youtube=jQq7QqSGGdw]

It really does feel like DnD: The Boardgame. 4th Edition DnD already feels like a boardgame as it is... but this is streamlined to get a dungeon crawl done in an hour and they've done just about as well as one could expect them to do. I gave up Descent for this game and I'm happy I did because of the quicker setup and play time. My only gripe about this game would be the lack of a real campaign mode like Descent Road to Legend offered.

I see myself playing more WoA or LoD adventures but using CR heroes (specifically the Human Ranger & Dwarf Cleric). Good Game :)

Who wouldn't want to take on the likes of Count von Strad?  Well, this game is your chance... sort of.  In actual play, the game is a clever, if not a bit simple, dungeon crawl, but it will not take you back to your AD&D days of Castle Ravenloft; nor will it bring a flood of role-playing back to you.  What it will provide is a mostly straight forward system in which you may experiment with the D&D 4E combat system and with a bit of attention and effort could relate an interesting tale of adventure.  The component quality is solid as well.  So it has some strengths.  

It also has some negatives.  The original as printed rules are not particularly good and in some ways are pretty down-right poor.  The revised rules available on the WotC website are much improved and essential - but not everyone knows to go hunt them down.  Experienced gamers - sure; but the bulk of the target market for the game?  Not as likely perhaps.  The programmed monsters work, but are frankly a bit simplistic in their tactics.  and its a bit surprising that more character development is possible - nor is a campaign available out of the box.  This factors all add up to down grade the game a notch or two.

So if you combine the good and bad, you get a respectable mid performing game that really has quite a bit of potential... if it's ever exploited in future releases or enhancements.

I love games I can play solo, which is technically all of them for learning purposes, but Castle Ravenloft you can actually run the dungeon, level up, and I liked the fact there were several scenarios to experience. It's more or less D&D 4e Lite, but the minis are solid, the rules work, and it's fun enough that I'd grab the other games in this series if I could find them at a decent price.

RATING: 7
Preliminary rating after one play.  A well executed dungeon crawl.  For everyone that says AD&D 4.0 took role playing and turned it into a board game, they're right. This is the end result.

I like the fact that it's simple and relatively easy to explain the rules.  If you've played AD&D 4.0 it's got some strong linkages.  The down side is that I'm afraid that after several playings it will start seeming bland and repetitive.

This game is brutal (in a good way). Every game walks that razors edge between victory and defeat, and I find that I get it to the table less because of that.

After three plays, I can say with some certainty that this game fails at what it attempts to be.  The crisis management aspect is frustrating, as you nearly always lose hit points every round to attacks you can't avoid.  Being cautious punishes you with events, but being bold punishes you with monster synergy.  Sometimes the events slap you for sticking together, sometimes for spreading out; there is no way to know which it will be.

The game does not sell the horror theme at all.  It feels more like running a gauntlet: plow through to the finish line before the constant beatings knock you out.

It doesn't feel like a dungeon crawl, either.  The placement and orientation of the tiles had little to no impact on the gameplay, and the monster AI is purposefully stupid so the heroes have a chance.

There are better crisis management games, there are better horror games, and there are better dungeon crawlers.  Fail.

Es un juego que te quita el "monillo" del mazmorreo. Pero no te esperes algo profundo, no lo es ni lo pretende.

El arte de las cartas y las losetas es muy mejorable... , pero por su precio me parece una buena relación calidad/precio.

This game is a fun, light, hack and slash dungeon crawl.  The game is easy to learn and teach.  The components are very good.  The players work together against the game to achieve the scenario goal.  I also play Descent, which I love.  However, Dungeons and Dragons board games are easier to set up and do not require an overlord. I see myself playing this game more often in the future. 


 Update:  I sold this game to prepare for a move and my son prefers Dungeon Saga.

I played 6 of the scenarios and after that I didn't feel like playing it anymore.  It feels like I have to fix the game before it becomes any fun.  In fact, I did do just that.  However, it is not perfect and don't want to spend my rare gaming time to fix a game when I have tons of other great games to play.  I am still looking for that right dungeon crawler coop game.

The components aren't the top of the line in the industry but they are acceptable enough for the price of the game.  Don't buy this game if you are looking for much depth though.  As dungeon crawls go it's at the bottom of the stack.

After numerous plays i have come to the conclusion this game is for the VERY light gamer.

Very good and entertaining COOP-game. No downtime, fast to play and very intense.

I had high hopes for this one but it turned out to be too dry.  I want a dungeon crawler with a good level up mechanic.  Zombicide does leveling up better than this game did.  I level up on a roll of a natural 20?  Who thought that up?


This game fell flat.

This board game is great to tear you away from World of Warcraft for a few hours.
It's a dungeon crawler with excellent mats and gameplay.

The plus: the system adapts itself to the number of players (1-5) and the players all play against the system.

While it may be not as surprising as a player based dungeon master, the design is marvellous and it is a real dungeon crawler. 

The game is a board game of the D&D system, but developped without much pretention which is great.

I love it since the time to play it is between 1 hour and 1hr 15.

Quite hard to achieve victory. Around 20% win / 80% loss if not cheating of course :))

Update 06/2011: game is a blast. For those wanting a fast dungeon crawler with fun gameplay and tense actions.

These days I mostly play it solo with 2 heroes: if you don't take a healer, it is a blast and a challenge to beat the scenarios.

RATING: 6
The gameplay here is decent, but I feel like it could have been so much more. The tiles are frustrating - you're exploring ancient Castle Ravenloft, but there's literally nothing of interest on the tiles, just squares and walls. It's really a meat grinder in play - something bad happens to you every turn. You have to understand that it's not really a dungeon crawling adventure like Descent, but a race to finish the mission before you inevitably die.

I initially rated this game highly -- the concept of DM-less gameplay excited me, and the D&D branding electrified the air.

I played my first game, which went well for the 3 of us, but I definitely felt a tinge of "Is that it?".  My second game was a narrow victory, and that felt great -- surviving by the skin of your teeth, whew, there's nothing like it.  Since then, however, I've lost every game I've played.  Who likes to play a game that they always lose?  In this case, I don't.  

I like the idea of CR, but most often it boils down to "Do I really want to spend the next 2 hours doing repetitive actions ... ultimately to just lose the game?"  

Beyond this basic, perhaps superficial reason to judge a game harshly, I think that the game play is much too repetitive.   By the basic "monsters always attack first" mechanic and the "encounters nearly all kick your tail regardless of what you do" problem, it would require a person an extreme degree of luck to actually beat most scenarios.

I just spent some time reading other low posts for this game, and many others (in the 2-3 range) have elaborated on the things I've mentioned.  For anyone interested in this game, be ware.  I'm hopeful that future expansions will fix the problems with this game, but I recommend that only after that point do you drop the cash to purchase this game. bg

OK the artwork is not as lavish as FFG and you don't get the painted miniatures like in Claustrophobia but at £40 + P&P this game represents great value for money. It has great depth and theme drawing on the fantastic heritage of D&D.

D&D CR is great! Yes, it's nothing like D&D (or it's not like 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 3.5 D&D which I have played), yes it's brutal on the players (encounter cards, yikes!!!), but boy it is fun! There are some games I actually enjoy getting destroyed when I play them. Maybe it is because when you actually win one of the scenarios, it feels so good! Great replayability with all of the scenarios, great minis, great fun!

Castle Ravenloft lacks the grueling difficulty that makes (modified) Doom such a gem.  Also, I think it could afford to be more stream-lined, too many tokens, cards etc.  Only played Scenario 2 twice.

RATING: 8
A decent dungeon crawler, Castle Ravenloft suffers from some mechanical issues, the main being how the monsters on a newly explored tile behave: there’s no way you can prevent those creatures from attacking you or a companion, let alone have a chance at defeating it before it strikes, which means you need to think twice whether to push deeper into the dungeon or wait for another player to do it.

Decidedly this suits the theme perfectly (it simulates conditions such as limited visibility and ambushes) but just seems odd: it really feels like a cheap ploy to let the monsters attack the party at least once, thus making the game quite hard.

On this subject, there’s no doubt Castle Ravenloft is deadly: most creatures have high attack bonuses and hit often; the encounter cards themselves, which you draw more often than you’d wish, are very dangerous, as no card in the deck is helpful to the party; and most of the treasures aren’t that powerful compared to the dangers the players have to face in the game.
All in all, two curative surges are often way too few to storm the dungeon successfully.

On a side note, it’s funny to see how well the poor D&D 4th edition fits a boardgame, which is what I thought ever since it was published: due to most of its clumsy rules and abstract powers, D&D 4 doesn’t work as a real RPG but would make a good boardgame rulesystem.

This game just confirmed my first impressions.

Good enough for cooperative play with friends, but if you have actual D&D experience you'll find this game frustratingly limited. Most of the combat is dull because heroes kill the monsters before they can act, and in the end heroes take most of their damage and threat from silly environmental cards. The forced rush to move through the dungeon is just annoying.
Bumps up to a 7 or 8 with proper house rules.

RATING: 7
After several plays, I find the game pretty fun, but you need a party that is willing to take the hurt that the games dishes out.

Like many good 'crawlers, you need teamwork and careful sequencing to succeed in each scenario. You need to study your characters' special abilities and be ready to use them when the occasions arise.

Strangely, the game does no seem very cohesive from a thematic standpoint. Monsters appear and strange things happen all the time that have no great relation to one another. The game is still fun, but it's nagging that everything feels so random until you meet the boss.

So it comes down to surviving whatever is hurled at you until you meet the final baddy. Do that through a dozen or so of scenarios of increasing severity. Perhaps the best thing that can be said (until I play more) is that it's a bit like DungeonQuest with parties and dirt simple combat.

RATING: 5.5
It's an okay co-operative game of dice rolling and variable player powers, but it got bogged down in all of the negotiation of how to fight the monsters and lost the fast-paced, hack-and-slash feeling that I would prefer.  The whole game centers around timing so it felt like a fantasy pandemic with all of the negotiations.  Also, I had to dock 0.5 from my rating for the unrealistic rule that allows newly drawn treasure items to be given to any fellow hero in the game, regardless of his location in the dungeon (castle).

A little ho-hum with 5 people, but we were still double checking the rules and what-not so it took longer than it will in the future.  I'm looking forward to games with fewer players.  Pretty trashy for my tastes, but I'm a sucker for most things D&D...  As far as board games go, the bits in this are top notch too!  Really excellent tiles and miniatures.  I think the cards are fine despite all the concerns about them being too thin.

RATING: 6
Beyond the hype and the backlash, it's just a moderately fun game which gives you a Dungeons and Dragons fix in the context of a one hour board game. That said, I don't know many other games which can claim that they do that exactly. It has minor problems that probably could have been fixed - the graphic design is a little bland, for example. There are some problems that can't fixed without adding complexity and playing time. There are some issues I have which I'm unsure of - drawing Encounter cards over and over can make one a little weary. Still, you get tactics, uniquely behaving monsters and a scenario storyline in an hour. It's a solid 6 - a moderately game to bring to the table when the mood strikes you and you need that particular itch scratched. Just like that food you really have taste for one day, the game's enjoyment could on that day exceed its quality and feel like an 8 or 9.

Edit: I will confess that since purchasing it and playing it a few times, I don't often have the enthusiasm for getting this to the table with so many other great co-ops out there. I understand that this game's two sequels have expanded variety and are preferred by many gamers, but I haven't felt the need to purchase them.

I'm quite pleased with Ravenloft!  I was looking for a fairly straught-forward dungeon crawl that would play in far less time than Descent, and decided to try it.  I'm quite impressed with the components, though Wizards of the Coast makes a few odd choices, like the hit point tokens not being double sided, and a few timing issues not covered in the rules that MUST have come up in play testing, but overall they put together a great and quite accessable dungeon crawl.  It flows quickly and despite the aforementioned rules warts I think it's great fun and look forward to playing it more!

The bottom fell out of the boat on this one.  Too simple, too random, too.... meh.  This won't be coming back out and is presently looking for a new home with a gamer that will love it.

It's good game, but there are so many things depends on your luck. 
You play some scenario, let's say, third time. First two times was your wins. But this third time... You know what to do, you doing everything right, but it's seems just cards are shuffled like this. Powerful monsters, three traps in a row - and you cannot do anything about that. You die, one by one, and lose on a third turn.
Game is good, but maybe too chaotic for me.

Inital rating after 1 play. I like the theme and most of the bits, but the 100% co-op seems like it is missing something.

Heroquest had the advantage of a player controlling the monsters, that makes a difference, here you can pretty much play it solo - having more players doesn't add anything as there is no hidden information (a common problem with co-ops) nor any tension/differing goals/objectives for the players.

Of course things might get added in expansions. As it stands, I'd play but no burning desire to own, especially given the price tag and big box.

** Update, my daughter loves adventure games, so this is now higher on my priority list to obtain a copy - and more chance I'll play and revise my rating

played with 2,3 and 5 people. the game mechanics scales very well. i guess there is a 50-60% chance to fail in the average, which encourages our group for replaying it. the bookkeeping is kept onto a minimum, which distinguishes it in a positive way from other games like descent or warhammer quest. it put all the important and good elements of dungeon crawlers into one game, and drops the annoying parts. as tiles and events are drawn randomly a mission never becomes the same. the only element we miss is some kind of campaign where characters can be improved sequently.

Not a bad dungeon crawl really.  I don't really like the "playing against the system" co-op feel of the game, although I think it is implemented well for what it is.

Very good game. One of the best Dungeoncralws out there, especially if you combine the different D&D Adventure games. You´ll then end up with tons of heroes, monsters, treasures and events. Wonderful minis and components. I wish the exploration factor and the tiles had a little more effect on the game. The game could have a lot more atmosphere if not for the lack of artwork on the cards and the tiles. They missed an opportunity here. It could have been the greatest Dungeoncrawl out there...

RATING: 5
I like the enemy "programmed" attacks, and the distribution of them around to the various players. For a combat heavy game, though (as DnD is), it shows more how the basic DnD game fails to provide the same fun without a skilled DM. Combat is exceedingly randomised with the d20, and we often lost on a single die roll for no other reason than it was the last one. 

The feeling, then, is that the game is dictated more by the single die than any cleverness of the players. 

I've played the first few scenarios multiple times and any time we lost (after 2 hours!) we didn't have any "we should have ____ instead of ____" thoughts.

I was a little disappointed by this one.   While I understand that it would appeal to the right crowd, I just wasn't entirely taken in by it. 

The part where a new monster appears in every single room is a little dumb, and sort of turns it from an exploration / puzzle game into a pure kill-the-monsters game.   So it's a little one dimensional in that regard.

The fact that is a co-op also makes this a little blah for me too.   It would be far more interesting if one of your crew was trying to sabotage your mission, or something like that.

This game is nothing special in some ways.  It has very little bling in terms of components.  The minis are nice, but the dungeon is pretty generic, and the reward cards have no illustrations.  The game feels simple.  And for some people this will be an issue; for me, though, it's the selling point.  My main problem with dungeon crawls is that they are too long, and either overwrought or repetitious.  If they are short, they are lacking in scope and strategy (a la DungeonQuest).  Ravenloft splits the difference perfectly.  You can play out a scenario in about an hour, and while it's simple, there's plenty to think about.  The reason for this is that most of the skills the characters use to control how they move and fight are limited in their use - many are one and done.  Artifacts are similar.  So when to use what you have, and how to sequence various actions amongst characters to make the best use of their skills gives you a great deal to think about.  There is a real sense of exploration, and it's fun to see how the dungeon unfolds, even if the individual parts are not so distinctive.  It's the perfect dungeon crawl for me: plays smooth and fast, but has enough meat on its bones to satisfy.  It feels thematic enough.  And it plays great solo!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Oh hey, It's D&D except it's a boardgame!

Nice for random dungeons and fun co-op. Not nice for poorly written rules. Way too many things have similar or unclear names. There are three things in the game, for example, which look like they could be "monster cards", and there is no part of the rules which actually talks about which pieces are the pieces with which names. This totally screwed up our first couple games, and we thought the came was totally terrible, until we realized that we were using the wrong 'monster cards' as the monster cards. What we were using was the 'monster placards' or something. duh, guys, come on...


It's all made better by the super sweet miniatures collection. Are you a GM who could use a hundred or so new miniatures for your tabletop battles? This set is worth picking up just for the minis. Seriously. Go look at the photos of this thing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Nice looking minis and board. The cards are very sparsely illustrated, though, which is a bit disappointing. The game starts slow, with almost no choices, but later there are interesting tactical decisions to make. There is no strategy involved. 

My rating is for roll players (not necessarily role players, that would depend on the group) and dungeon crawler fans. Others would probably rate lower by one to three points, depending on how much luck influence they can tolerate in such a rather long game.

After playing a bit more I think the above sounds a bit harsh. This game can be a bucket full of fun with the right group.

Very good, simplified 4e D&D style dungeon crawl game.  Lacks the more interesting combat of Descent because there is no human intelligence behind the monsters' actions, but it is still quite fun.  Also, it is much, much quicker than any other dungeon crawl game I have played.  I like it!

This review applies to both Castle Ravenloft and Wrath of Ashardalon.

I have generally held that, having played decades of real RPGs, RPG-lites have nothing to offer me.  I was wrong.  This game is cute, takes ten minutes to set up, and presents fun little tactical puzzles with fantasy dressing.

The RPG veteran in me chafes at the restrictions, but the general gamer in me likes the simplicity when it comes to playing with neophytes and my children.

The core system makes for a very fun, light tactical co-op game. Non-gamers will be up-and-running in minutes, and when hammed up a bit it provides an RPG-lite fix for those of us who used to play D&D once upon a time. But the real greatness of this game comes from the amazing ecosystem of variants that it has generated: new adventures, new heroes, new monsters, new systems, and variant rulesets.

Kick butt game. I did have to change a few rules. Mainly, When not exploring, instead of always pulling a encounter card I roll, 1-15 encounter, 16+ none. I feel this small change makes the game feel more engaging, this needed change IMO is the only reason I give it a 9/10 and not a 10/10. I'm going to try the next play though with 1's making you draw 2 encounters. Great game.

During our first game I'm pretty sure we encountered EVERY possible rules ambiguity there in this game. What the rulebook lacks in length it makes up for in vagueness.

Also this game REALLY could have used another rules summary card with quick reminders for all the tiny rules you're likely to forget (moving diagonally is okay, except across tiles. One player can't control two identical monsters, etc.)

This game works, but that's really all there is to it. There's nothing to do besides combat, which would be fine, if the combat weren't deeply bland - there's no real interesting decisions to make here, just mostly spamming the same attack and rolling the dice every turn. The game feels like it could play itself. Yeah, it's shorter and less complex than Descent, but in this case the loss of complexity equates to loss of interesting choices and variety.

Having now played multiple games, my opinion of this has skyrocketed.  It reminds me of my reaction to Descent: at first, it seems like a bunch of luck, but the more you know the characters and the range of monsters and encounters and treasures,the more the strategic side unfolds.  Then the luck factor becomes fun, instead of overwhelming.  Add in the fact that it's all co-op, and for me the rating goes up again.  When playing with 2, play 3 characters, though, I think.

It's a co-op, so for me, it is hard to give it a higher rating.  I wanted to try it out tho, because I heard the monster AI was pretty fun and it is.  The combat mechanics are kind of lackluster and the abilities are fun but kind of bland.  The treasure cards seem to be more situational and not character power based, so that was also a downer for me.  I would really enjoy a game like this combining the monster AI of castle ravenloft with the ability system of World of Warcraft.

It is a good game specially for solitaire playing.  You will become a dungeon crawler dealing with the traps, environment and monsters in order to achieve objective in about 12-15 rounds.  This game can provide tense environment to play with within 1.5 hour play.  I like war game but I don't like to see those numbers on a small tile and dig out too many numbers on reference sheet.  Thus, I switch from war games to this miniature dungeon crawl game.  This game impress me!  The mechanics and tactics may be too simple for a tactic war gamer.  However, what do you expect for 1-2 hours play? For me, the time and mechanics are just right for 1-2 hours play.  The miniatures are pretty good.  Enjoy it very much for spending 1-2 hours playing.

My initial impression after five games is very favorable.  This is a very light dungeon crawl game, but has some interesting mechanics and decisions.  The rules are fairly easy to understand for a game of this type, and the whole thing can be played to conclusion in probably about 90 minutes (depending on the scenario).  Reminds me a little of Warhammer Quest, but is streamlined, with both the good and bad that brings.  I have a feeling I'll get some mileage out of this one, and it could see lots of play time!

RATING: 8.9
This game is really good.  All the mechanics are nice.  The theme is great and is felt throughout all gameplay.  The choosing abilities to use among different classes and all different scenarios make for a lot of replayability, adding it's compatible with all further releases, makes it even better.

The only complain I have about this game is the starting treasure for the heroes and treasures overall are lame and either have not enough impact or just don't matter at all.  I also wish rules on treasures were just a bit clearer.

Overall I love this game and can't wait to buy my Legend of Drizzt to follow it up

RATING: 9
13 plays (3p x 12, 4p x 1)--mucho fun. While I agree with some of the criticisms, and think other dungeon crawls (Doom, Space Hulk, Betrayal) offer smoother mechanics and more sensible theme integration, I nonetheless enjoy this game a lot--maybe more. I think as I play it more I'm able to understand what it's trying to do with mechanics and theme, and I'm able to make it work for me. It's a plus that none of the players have to be the dungeon master. Although it is cooperative, it doesn't feel like "a cooperative game" to me. With experience, we're improving our success rate, and play faster. I like this from the first and it's growing on me. Happy to play again. The Howling Hag scenario is excellent, presents a terrific adventure situation.

Based on several plays, Castle Ravenloft is quite a good game. The rules are reasonably easy to follow and the game play is fun, though a little too tough by the default level. The game really needs an initative system rather than letting monsters attack first.

Move, flip a tile, get hit by a monster. Hope to live, attack, move, avoid adding a tile, get an encounter, find a trap ... Game is very repetitive. There is a lot in the box, but does not add much to the game system.

RATING: 8
This is a great intro to D&D for the uninitiated. Comes with a set of premade characters with decent minis, a huge set of tiles for random dungeon layouts, and multiple scenarios so you won't get bored after the first playthrough. The overall rules are rather simplified compared to a full game of D&D, but it does a good job of introducing the basics of how d20 combat works without the extra complexities. It's rather pricy, but I definitely recommend it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
My first impression of this game was that much of the movement was arbitrary and meaningless. However, I've changed my opinion after several plays. Movement is still not as dynamic as I would prefer (too many monsters just move adjacent to you) but it does make a difference depending on which tiles get drawn and where the walls are. 

I had to make some player aids to help organize all the "stuff" on the table in order to keep track of it all in a clean fashion. 

Update: Every time I play this, I like it less. However, I've come up with a set of house rules that make the game much more enjoyable.

RATING: 4
I received all three of the D&D board games as a gift. While they're not bad, they're more of a dungeon crawler on fast-forward than a traditional D&D adventure. I felt like I was playing as a medieval SWAT team rather than adventurers. Spawning monsters or triggering traps every turn was also really stressful, and not in a good way.

I felt that Castle Ravenloft was the weakest of the three. I don't think Wizards had found their groove with this series yet. The DM-less monster rules were clever though, and I don't know why more dungeon crawl games haven't tried implementing them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Lightweight but very attractive dungeon crawl that provides a high-quality introductory D&D-like experience.  The rules are pretty simple though as with most board games there will be a little time required to learn them.  Once you get the hang of it the gameplay goes pretty fast.  (Rules can be summarized easily on one page -- check out the excellent summary sheet by UniversalHead.)  The adventure scenarios are well designed, even including a couple of solo adventures.  

Quality of the game pieces and the board is very nice though if you want painted minis ... that's not why you buy this game.  I personally appreciate the fact that the heros are a different color from the bad guys, which makes it much easier to see what's going on at a glance.

This one lured my 11-year-old videogame addict off the consoles to play with the family and got him asking for more.  I recommend this for families.  It's a rare cooperative game that is not simply mutual solitaire, and you can play it with kids without going brain-dead.  If you don't like the "violence" aspect -- have the weapons all be made of foam and have the monsters go off for cookies and juice when they're out of HP (srsly, take it from an experienced mom, this ruse works for sensitive kids).

I would love to see a set of "advanced" rules or an expansion set of cards for this game bringing in some additional mechanics such as skill challenges or whatnot

Easy rule set if you're familiar with D&D. Very good components.  Player turns were pretty slow and there was lots of downtime.  I think where this game would really shine is when all players are engaged in planning and cooperating instead of treating their turns as their singular contribution.  Even at its best, I can't see wanting to play this more than a couple times a year -- not so interested in thematic games...

Excellent game! Lots of fun and has excellent replay value. The components are great and the scenario's are well done. Simple rules and fast play. It has a great mix of monsters and a good choice of adventurers to choose from, depending on the play style you want to use.

Update 12/4
The game has definitely grown on me. While by no means perfect it does fit the role of a nice light dungeon crawl.

---

Update 11/14
Played scenario two and the game flowed much better and was a bit more tense, so I will bum my rating up a point. Still, the game is ok to play once in a while, but I doubt I will be buying it.

---

Nice component quality except for the really thin playing cards. There have been some complaints about a chemical smell from some copies. I have seen 3 or 4 copies now and while there was some of that smell present it was only a 1 or 2 on the Dank in Dark Stench-O-Meter. Owners with their stinky copies should just thank whichever god they believe in that it is no where near as rank as Duel. Just opening that game's box in public could cause you to get slapped with UN sanctions placed against you for suspected WMDs. Having those blue helmeted peace keepers showing up for wargame game night would be a drag!

I have only played one scenario and we jumped right into #9. There were 5 of us and it was ridiculously easy to win. I am wondering if the designers of the game were only targeting kids 10-13 and none of the "and above" crowd. We all approach the scenario logically and used strategy to funnel the monsters into kill zones. Maybe the creators thought we would just go blundering through the dungeon activating all the monsters with chaotic glee.

Also, what gives with the Blazing Skeletons" that were not cast in a translucent red plastic, but in translucent BLUE plastic. They seem to be more like Cool Mint Skeletons w/Retsyn. 

While it is nice to have a fairly quick dungeon crawl that does not require a game master I am pretty ho-hum on at least one of the scenarios. Hopefully, another game or will change my mind, but until then I only rate the game a 5.

It is a simple cooperative hack-and-slash [u]dungeon crawler[/u] with a cinematic feeling. High thematic, very challenging, good replayability, fast paced, iconic monsters. I bought it to playing mostly [color=red]solitaire[/color] sessions (one of my best solitaire games; it has amazing scalability, so it is possible to play with just one or two characters in almost all cases!) or cooperative sessions without a Dungeon Master, and for it's wonderful components (I intend to use it's miniatures and tiles in other D&D 4e sessions). Great production value (42 minis, 42 tiles etc.).
I'm not happy with the setup time, a big space is needed to play it and the monsters move by tiles which is not very realistic. Also, it's hard to bring it to the table.
Easy to make custom scenarios for this game and a lot of free scenarios and characters/monsters can be downloaded from BGG.

RATING: 4
It's D&D 4e with none of the healing and lowered damage and monster hit points. On the bright side some of the character abilities are fun. On the down side it's basically a war of attrition, trying to survive and stave off damage just long enough to beat the adventure before you die. There aren't many ways to heal, and few respites from drawing monsters and/or encounters every turn, so you never feel like you're doing well.

Level-ups being random (you have to earn XP and then also roll a 20) isn't fun because it might never happen, and drastically affects the difficulty of the adventure. Having one character level up deny all other players from doing so isn't fun, because you're hurting the rest of the party who are supposed to be your friends and allies.

If you want to play D&D, just play that. A game of 4e is much more fun because you can heal and rest and change the pace of the game. If you want to play a board game there are many others with better mechanics that are more fun.

Nice theme. I never actually played the D&D mod (only dabbled in D&D at all), but I remember seeing it in stores back in the day as one of the early mods. I'm admittedly not the target audience, as I'm not a big co-op fan. Despite sort of liking the idea. There is no hidden info, so no real way for players to pretend they are independent, which kinda killed it for me. Huge box (BattleLore size). Only played the intro adventure. Presumably more advanced adventures are better, but I don't think would change anything significantly for me. At least it was pretty trued to the claimed 1 hour playtime.

RATING: 8
After playing the first adventure with one hero, I was underwhelmed. I've really enjoyed playing later scenarios, though, with all five heroes. I love that it can be played solo. There are decisions to be made all the time, whether it's you moving and attacking or the monsters. The best I can tell, the detractors tend to dislike that the game is not very much like a simulation or not very much like role-playing (It's been years since I was a regular role-player, myself). It's more abstract than that, and if you're willing to accept the abstraction, it's a great game. There's a lot of ways to optimize your play, and the more familiar with the game you get, the more you're likely to see how you could play better. On the whole, the scenarios are very well constructed, and I'm impressed by what the designers have managed to accomplish here.

You are invited, to the dread realm of Ravenloft. 

Having played this at The Other Ones years ago, I had my own copy for a couple of years but I only opened my copy this year (2013) as my regular gaming group was missing members for a couple of consecutive weeks. 

The games that I played in the club never seemed to be completable in 3 hours, so we've only dabbled in the first few scenarios, which are quicker. 

This game runs quickly for my groups because we're roleplayers and have experience with D&D to understand movement, magic, etc.

The strategy of this game is to use the best power or best treasure item at the right time. I thouroughly enjoy this game. I enjoy the theme. The game play is light. I love the variety in different scenarios.

I strongly recommend that you play the solo scenario called "Impossible" to learn how to play all the different classes.

After the 5 plays I've had with the game, I can stick by my rating.  My group enjoys the Dungeon and Dragons Worlds and enjoy a bit of 4th edition now and then.  The game can be very harsh at times with the encounter cards, but we've enjoyed the challenge.  Modular board, aside from the repetitive tiles (a lot of gray tiles), keeps it fresh as long as you're not looking for anything took exotic in art.  We don't play it all the time; which I feel would take down my rating, but if you play on occasion it's a very pleasant game to play.

I have added my house rules and created my custom scenarios to make the game more appealing to me. 

I've always been fascinated with the D&D theme but turned off by the complexity of the rules. I just never found it enjoyable. I never liked the idea of rolling 5 dice just to see if I correctly put one foot in front of the other when walking so to speak. These games offer a much more simplified and streamlined version of D&D rules. I honestly cannot compare since I never really got into hardcore D&D to began with. But I do know that I have fun with these games and I'm very immersed in the theme, so I found them enjoyable.

I think I need to play with some variants with this one. Of the games I've played so far, it seems like it's just turn after constant turn of trying to "stay afloat", fighting off the swarm of monsters. And given they always attack first, you have to be pretty lucky overall to survive a mission.

I was worried that having read so many reviews, this game will fall flat to me. Too generic tile, too generic enemies. But too my surprise, it holds quite few enough flavor to be tasty. Not super delicious, but tasty enough.

Very light variant of the D&D role playing game...and I mean VERY :)...It's more of a dungeon crawl than an RPG but it's good for introducing new people to the genre and teaching them the basic rules of D&D...it's challenging and the theme is well implemented. All in all a good game for when you don't have 3-5 hours for a D&D session and just want to bloody your hero for an hour or so by sending him wave after wave of monsters.

I'm a huge Descent fan.  If I could play that a couple times a week, I would.  But, given the long setup and play times, that's not possible.  The great thing about Ravenloft is how quick it can be setup and played.  Mechanics are not as deep as Descent, but that's why it can play so much faster.  The theme and ambiance is there, though, which makes it distill the dungeon crawl experience into a quick, enjoyable 45-60 minutes.

A bit of a missed opportunity here.
While the game has been simplified and streamlined to get down to the 1 hour playing time, I feel they have made it a bit too simple.
There is not enough interaction and choices to be made.
Scaling betweeen number of players is great. Movement/reaction system for monsters works fine too. But the random dungeon setup simply means you will find the room you have been looking for when you have turned over all the tiles that have been randomly placed on top. So your desired location might turn up deep in the dungeon, or you might end up finding it right beside the entrance, as you turn around and explore previously ignored passages. All tiles are more or less the same, too. No special tiles with seperate rules for movement, combat etc.
As a pure hack and slash this game works. But if you want a more involved game than that, this is not the game.
I look at this game to be more of a sand box game, than anything else. The basics are solid, but it screams for house rules.
Where is the sense of adventure? Where are the hard choices you have to face together as a group?

Descent without the Overlord (and most of your day) and a nice ruleset that keeps things simple. I was up and playing without having read the rules in less than two minutes, although having a basic understanding of how 4th Ed D&D works was a huge help in understanding the concept of one-use and multi-use powers.

Slightly more fun than Dungeon!, but still not one of my favorites. Maybe if the treasures were not useless. The majority of them have to be used immediately and the conditions that would make them useful are usually not present at that time.

This game was actually quite a bit of fun. I enjoyed the mechanics, I enjoyed the way it played. But, in all reality Descent is better in every way except that you can't play completely co-op. So, with that in mind I traded this away and replaced the dungeon crawl feel with my beautiful copy of Descent and the co-op with a very similar feel with Mice and Mystics.

Plays: 1

Pro's:
+ great components
+ nice streamlined mechanisms
 
Con's:
- Ravenloft's creepy atmosphere is totally missing
- I suspect gameplay gets very repetitive after a few plays.

So:
Don't expect a simplified version of a RPG set in Ravenloft. It's totally different. Not scary, no story-lines, etc. In fact, the atmospheric texts on random events only makes playing this game more hilarious.
However, it is a very fun game to play. Because of the randomness I suspect after a few games things get a bit boring.

Castle Ravenloft is a cooperative dungeon crawl that scales well from 1 to 5 players and generally plays in an hour. This game has it all - a variety of mean monsters, courageous heroes, devilish villains, useful treasure, intricate traps and dungeon tiles, dungeon tiles and dungeon tiles. And if this was not enough there are also 13 scenarios to play the game in the box, each one almost infinitely re-playable in itself.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Quick and easy dungeon crawling. Plays like D&D 4th edition lite, which is fantastic in terms of balance. A little disappointed they just brought out another board game rather than make a few modular expansions to this one.

RATING: 8.5
Castlevania in board game form!  It's punishing even during the introductory quest, but worth the play time if you're looking for a light dungeon delve with a single-stage leveling mechanic.  Great mini's, and a good set of base quests available, along with some great custom quests here on the Geek.

RATING: 9
Fantantic rules...very short and well written.  You can pick it up and being playing very quickly.  I love the theme, and monsters included in the game.  Choice of characters and abilities should keep it fresh.

I like the construction of the game.  There is a lot of pressure from monsters, but treasure cards keep you deep in options for your turn.  I also liked the player powers.  The different classes really do play true to D&D.  Very well done.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I'd call Castle Ravenloft solidly "okay". I'm sure the setting holds a soft spot for some old-school D&D folks but the collection of enemies and locale really doesn't evoke the setting I want from a D&D game.  I also feel like it's missing some of the fun decision points that good dungeon crawlers should have.

Still, the mechanics are pretty clever and really easy to learn.  If you want a simple dungeon crawler this is not a bad way to go.  

I would recommend Wrath of Ashardalon over this every time though.

Got it to have more options to customize LoD (treasures, tiles, monsters, adventure ideas) and to have a few more scenarios to play with out of the box. Also, there seems to be lot more custom content for CR. It is not really much different from LoD though.

RATING: 5
I'm enjoying this with my 8-year-old son as a fun adventure game. It's always fun to explore a dungeon and fight monsters, gain treasure, and possibly fulfill the scenario goal in the process. The game is a race, and you can't just sit and rest without consequences. But, there's a lot of randomness with all the dice rolls and card draws. Still, it's quite fun.

Some rules I wasn't clear on from reading the rules (and playing), but have since clarified:
1) Diagonal attacks are permitted for adjacency. (Use same rules for movement. i.e. diagonal for squares, but not "tiles".)
2) Shuffle all Dungeon Tiles into stack, including "special"
3) Obstacles (furniture, etc.) do not hinder movement.
4) Conditions (Slow, Immobilized) affect hero's speed, but do not affect Move actions provided by power cards. 
5) Villians are considered Monsters.
6) Players earn experience equal to the Villian's Level.

Update: Too much downtime for the boy, so he isn't interested in it. Scenarios aren't all that different, so the game is quite repetitive. Too much randomness in the treasure draws, monster draws, encounter step, and die rolls.

I really want to like this game, but... 

But I just can't.  The art ranges from nonexistent to boring, the gameplay lacks theme--a critical problem for dungeon crawl, and the lack of any real character growth means there's no attachment between the player and his little plastic avatar.  

The system is neat, I suppose.  The randomly generated map and the spawn system could be quite good if the designers had put some more work into it.  It is almost as if the designers built the framework for the game but forgot to finish the job.

Need to try a few more times.  Something lacking here.  It is short on atmosphere, and also a little short on tension.  I really liked the randomized character abilities though and the map generation was quite good.  Perhaps a little too processional?  Treasures a little too soulless?  A little too on the missing something side.  I'll still buy Ashardalon tho for sure.

RATING: 7.5
Take One (Solo Play):
Hmmmm. Well, first off, I was really hoping that the "Dungeons & Dragons: Castle Ravenloft Board Game" would be less "Gauntlet: The Board Game" (I.E. like "Descent"). Dear game designers: can you possibly cobble together a dungeon crawl game that actually incorporates room-by-room surprises, mystery, traps, and problem solving instead of a constant conveyor belt of enemies to kill? Playing this I get a mental picture of four or five monsters standing around just off-board, smoking, with numbered tickets in their hands and looking at their wrist watches.

Also, I sincerely hope that the game improves strategically somewhat when played with others since I really don't feel as if I tactically had much effect on the outcome of the game. In fact, if anything, I feel as if my little plastic Dwarf friend was undone by some pretty horrendous luck.

Take Two (Two-Player Game):

The game plays SO much better with two players.  Using XP to cancel really nasty Encounters is HIGHLY recommended, since you never know when or IF you’ll ever level up.  Even in forgetting to give our characters a starting Treasure card, we still made it through Scenario Two without real strife.

Take Three (Four-Player Game):
Despite the loss and the vagaries of the rules we had a blast and look forward playing it again.  The fact that the game play time is so abbreviated, it’s not so painful than say, a loss in "Descent", which kinda hurts after a three to six hour time investment.   

Scenario Three is still unconquered (Curse You, Klak!) but we completed "Daylight Assault" on our first go. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Wonderful bits; horribly written rules. The rules and adventures remind me (unfortunately) of the poor effort of Betrayal at the House on the Hill. What's up with such shabby and contradictory writing? The game has been out for a very short time and has already accumulated 21(!) pages of rules threads. At this point, I am questioning my decision to purchase. No longer questioned: I traded the game away for something else that my kids might enjoy.

RATING: 3
OK,I'm not the greatest fan of Dungeon-crawl board games.  Most of them never reach what it feels like to play an RPG.  This one is no exception. 
Anyway.....
The positives - the miniatures are cool.  The event cards, although having minimal info, all have a flavor text line that really does well at fleshing out the encounter and explaining it at the same time. 
 
Now, the negatives.  First, the character powers are quite limited.  Second, there should be some difference between the utility and daily power - maybe something like a time track so that the daily power recycles faster/slower than the utility power.  Next, a lot of the treasure cards seemed pretty useless.  Finally, the rule book just out-and-out sucks.  It's horrid, and beneath what I would expect from WoTC.  It's almost like they really didn't care for the project, and so didn't put their best effort into it.  I'd be willing to play the game again, but it's definitely one I wouldn't waste my money buying.

OK, a second play has not changed my mind about this game. Basically, this game just isn't fun.  It's brutal, to the point that there's a much better than even chance that your character won't even be alive to complete the game.  There's no coherent narrative to really tie the whole thing together and draw you into the game.  You don't feel like part of a story like you do when playing an RPG. Bottom line, repeating myself, this just ain't FUN.  
To tell the truth, I find myself enjoying these big box FFG plasti-fests less and less.  I guess I feel that, if you're gonna play a board game, play a board game.  If you're gonna play an RPG, play an RPG.  The two just don't meet very well.

Misses the whole point of DnD by not having characters persist.  Whole point of a dungeon crawl, really.  But even if you drop the DnD name off it and look at it in the context of Descent, it still falls short.  Number of monster powers and player powers aren't even close.  Pick 2 of 3?  Really?  Or pick 3 from 36.

Update 4-3: At its heart it is pure roll and move if you think about it.  No actual decisions to be made other than if the dice let you move to the next tile.  The "decision" of which power to use may appeal to the monkey audience this is targeted at.  "If there is one guy I press this button.  If there are more guys I press this big shiny button."

4e DMG has random dungeon generator where you can fight with tactics.  Road to Legend has a campaign that lets you plan character progression.  Neither are particularly good, but at least you are thinking more than rolling.

RATING: 5
Players are dungeon heroes, cooperating below Castle Ravenloft.  Cooperative fantasy game where players take turns trying to achieve scenario objectives.  Turns are very simple - move and attack; explore the dungeon, attack with any of "your" monsters (ones you triggered).  Combat is standard D&D D20+modifiers against armour class, inflicting hit points.  The game appears to be very tough to beat, as monsters typically get first whack at you, and your hit points erode very quickly.  The difficulty can be tuned though, via different numbers of healing surges.  Nice bits, great minis, simple rules and 12 scenarios, including solitaire.  Very nice package, and fun game.

The first initial play was pretty fun, the player powers seem well designed and exciting, but some of the rules seem a bit odd or unintuitive. I need additional plays before rating it.

Update: After a completely frustrating play of Scenario 4, where the poorly written scenario and rulebook interfered with having a good time, and the monster slaying got boring and repetitive, I'm putting this up for trade.  I feel that other games do a better job of providing what I was looking for here (co-op isn't an important feature to me).

This game is far from perfect and the ruleset/rulebook needs some work.  It's a shame too, really...  I think if WotC had spent another few solid months playtesting and developing this game before releasing it, they would have had an instant classic - truly worthy of all the hype.  As it stands, the system just seems incomplete to me.

All of that having been said, there are a TON of neat ideas here and the contents of the box still have enormous potential as a sandbox for making and tweaking your own dungeon designs.  There is certainly an awesome game in the box somewhere, I've no doubt about it, but the rules for it do not ship with the game.  Ashardalon (and then Drizzt) will also probably go a long way into fleshing out the system and making this the game it should have been in the first place.  Until then, it loses some points from me...

The game also loses some point for having perhaps the blandest modular board ever.  I realize that it's a dungeon - but still!  Look at Claustrophobia!  That's how beautiful modular board tiles should be!

However, the game gets bonus points for having a ridiculously large number of ridiculously awesome minis and for the system being practically designed around solitaire play.  :thumbsup:

These games are fantastic especially when playing with my wife(actually all games get elevated to awesome status when playing with my wife but these ones do especially).  Get in crazy situations, blast your way out, or die trying.  I find if I burn my special abilities throughout the course of the game rather than save them for the end I have a much better time.  Great moments in board gaming have been had here.  

Ravenloft seems the most challenging/punishing of the bunch.  If you want to get whooped badly then this one is for you.

Ashardalon seems easier as a lot of the treasures are really sick (powerful).

Drizzt certainly has the most powerful characters and hence the easiest scenarios, but the characters are also the most interesting to play due to the mechanics behind their abilities.  Play without healing surges.

Ravenloft and Ashardalon heroes can be elevated to Drizzt level power with that amazaballs Ashardalon loot, although they still won't be as mechanically interesting.

In general the gameplay was fun, and I'd play again.  Solo was good, decent challenge, but it came down to rolling a D20, and minor decisions.  There's a lot of other games that I'd rather play - in fact Tomb is a better dice rolling dungeon crawl, despite the cardboard standees.

The gold standard in "you lose" style dungeon crawls. Good selection of monsters and abilities, although the event and treasure decks are not balanced well.

Its main impact on me so far is to have reawakened an (expensive) interest in figure painting.

Have played 3 solo games and enjoyed them. Am wondering if it's a little too stripped-down. It seems the game will be as good as the scenarios allow.

3 further games to defeat the Kobold Sorcerer. Very enjoyable but game moves, jarringly, from hard to easy with introduction of the Cleric.

UPDATE: Despite many other co-op dungeon crawls coming out since, I would still suggest the games in this series if you want a simpler, playable in an hour game. 

A great game. Sure there are some rules ambiguities, but there are in almost all co-op games. Most complaints of the game can be summarized as "it's not Descent!" It is not Descent, nor was it meant to be. It's a co-op game playable in an hour or so.

I got this game as a gift and I was hoping it would be an easier and lighter alternative to regular D&D for my 10 year-old son and I. We have played it once. 
I think if they had spent a little more time on the design then this game could have been really great. It's not bad, I would try it again, and the other D&D board games might have improved (I think this was the first of its kind). The modular game board was done well and seems to give the game replayability. The thing I did not love about it was that the combat seemed be very repetitive. There has to be a better mechanic for RPG combat other than roll a die and hope you get a high enough number. I'm still trying to figure out what that would be.

So much fun to open and play... setup time is long however, so I don't break it out often.
After a few plays, though, the mechanics actually work fine with few house rules... the one house rule I like for this version is to ROLL for ENCOUNTER (1-13 = Draw Encounter; 14-18 Nothing; 19-20 Find Treasure)... that simple change I think really allows the game to at least feel more balanced.
I also wish to incorporate the Legend of Drizzt "STALAGMITE" monster/encounter card.  You only need one or two to really make the game feel balanced.

[2 plays] I don't hate this game and my experiences playing it have not been actively unpleasant, but it's not something I would ever bother with of my own volition. I love boardgames and I love D&D but I'd rather do either than play this game, which attempts to mix the two but leaves out the best of both.

RATING: 8
I enjoyed this more than the other dungeon crawls I have played, though it is better described as a co-op with a dungeon crawling theme.  Played the first two scenarios which both seemed far too easy.  Fighting the kobold boss of the second scenario was very clever and interesting.  I hope the difficulty in later scenarios ramps up or this won't be seeing much play.

The components bore me though.  There is no artwork on any the cards.  The tiles are extremely bland looking and WotC put no effort into making the tiles match on blocking edges.  The minis are the only thing this game has going for it component-wise.  I try not to get hung up on components too much, but an Ameritrash dungeon crawl should have high production value.

The dice alternately loved and hated me during my first play of this... unfortunately, they loved me (20! 18!  17!  and so on!) when I rolled for the monsters and they hated me (1!  3! 1 less than I needed! and so on!) when I rolled during the Hero phase...

This game is a lot of fun, and I can definitely see getting it at some point, although that point will probably be further away than I'd like it to be.   :D

It's not the same experience as a full eight-plus hour D&D session with an experienced DM, of course, but if Castle Ravenloft is not the best possible one hour long, fully co-op dungeon crawl, it's pretty close. My primary concern is the lack of replay -- I don't foresee running through the fifteen or so adventures more than twice each. On the other hand, thirty plays is more than most of my games get.

(As of [b]1[/b] play) A pretty standard dungeon crawl cooperative with nothing to really set it apart from similar games apart from its relatively short playing time. A bit too disjointed and random to be particularly captivating, but great bits plus a classic theme make it the enjoyable game equivalent of a "popcorn movie".

This had a window to capture the cooperative dungeon-crawler market but missed out badly. Now, there are any number of much more interesting designs on Kickstarter. And what’s amazing is that despite coming in with THE name for this type of genre, they fumbled both the game play and the thematic experience. 

The game play is stale with how monsters are spawned and move, and the lack of story or campaign don’t inspire repeat plays. It all feels like a first draft of a dungeon crawler. Again, there are way more interesting – visually, mechanically, thematically – available games these days.

It’s niche is probably as a gateway dungeon crawler for kids.

RATING: 4
Though the sheer amount of card-flipping has the tendency to bog down gameplay, Castle Ravenloft manages to be sort of enjoyable despite itself.  The classes are all fun to play, and the emphasis on teamwork gives Ravenloft a feel all its own.  That said, whether you'll win or lose all boils down to luck: how many gargoyles and wraiths will turn up in your monster deck?  There is no time for rest in Ravenloft, and if you try to catch a breather, the game punishes you by tossing more monsters your way.  

In subsequent plays, I found myself having less and less fun with Ravenloft, particularly in scenarios that featured boss monsters.  Juggling the boss monsters' powers while handling random monster encounters and traps just feels overwhelming.  Believe it or not, playing *real* D&D somehow feels less complex than Ravenloft.

I love the game. It is just what i wanted. All the feel of D&D without all the work. I know its a bit of a cop out to play this instead, but for me to feel like part of the party rather than the DM was a great change. 

The miniatures are amazing and i cant wait to get them painted.

While it doesn't replicate the experience of paper and dice gaming a lengthy multi-session D&D campaign, it is a good enough substitute for someone too time strapped for that sort of endeavor. Plus the components are really high quality, and the theme is done nicely. That said, it only made it to the table once and I couldn't justify keeping it without another person interested in playing it with me. Traded away.

I was really excited for this game, but its not quite all I would have hoped for. I don't get to play D&D anymore and I was hoping that this would capture some of the feeling for me. In the end it is just fight and move -- there really isn't much more to it. I was hoping for a bit more narrative and theme, but while it certainly has a thematic "look", it doesn't really provide immersion.I also prefer the coop experience of Pandemic, for example, to this. I'll give it a few more plays and I want to check out some of the fan generated scenarios before I call it quits.

Really enjoy this game, especially when mixed with the monsters from Wrath of Ashardalon to give it a little more variety.

The monsters being able to attack you straight away is a bit...meh.
We have found that it tends to be the same person time after time who 'discovers' the monsters and so they get battered very quickly. There doesn’t seem to be quite enough healing, treasures are very hit and miss and the bigger monsters turn into a grind to kill as they have so many hit points.

8/22/10  I've avoided checking out Castle Ravenloft until today. Now I'm feeling the draw of adding a dungeon crawl to my collection.

11/30/10  Finished with Castle Ravenloft. We won pretty easily. I'm going to keep trying to trade for it. It's fun and I think my sons would like it.

12/4/10  Trading Battles of Westeros for Castle Ravenloft. Breaking my "no more scenario-based games" rule, but Ravenloft can be played solo!

12/10/10  @mischakrilov Have fun!  Think of it as a fantasy co-op more than a dungeon delve. I like it!

12/10/10  @mischakrilov It's not difficult, but there are a bunch of little things to remember. I think I'm going to print the flowchart from bgg.

12/13/10  Tried to escape from Castle Ravenloft: Strahd woke early, but my ranger was fast. Found the exit when Strahd finally caught me and I died.

2/1/11  Castle Ravenloft has some flaws but I think I'm on board for Wrath of Ashardalon. I like some of the changes and I love the dragon! 

2/14/11  Ravenloft demo level. 2 gargoyles in King's Crypt: Thorgrim cut down. Allisa hurt 1 then died. Arjhan breathed fire & cleaved them apart!

2/19/11  Later played solo game of Wrath of Ashardalon. Fun! Nice new monster tactics. Do I combine with Ravenloft or keep separate? Can't decide.

4/25/11  5/1/11  Feeling tempted by Lord of the Ring Card Game. I already started committing to a solo/co-op fantasy series, though ((Ravenloft/Ashardalon)

A solid co-op dungeon crawl game.  Totally worth the purchase price just for the components.  A pile of minis and dungeon tiles makes for handy bits.  The game itself is decent, but not amazing.  I am not a huge fan of the fact that EVERY TILE HAS A MONSTER.  It takes so surprise and excitement out of exploring.  It is the opposite end of the spectrum from Descent: Journeys in the dark.  Easy to learn, plays fast, not a lot of strategy.  What I need, is a game in the middle...

I'm disappointed... I think that WotC totally missed the spirit of D&D with this game as CR is almost purely a tactical combat game. If offers only a thin veneer of RPG elements, and absolutely no adventuring other than placing a generic dungeon tile to create the board. If I were to rate it as an RPBG it gets a 4 and as a tactical game it would get 6 due to limited amount of turn choices that are given to the players (wash, rinse, repeat) - so in the end it gets a 5.

This is an excellent cooperative board game that incorporates rpg elements with quick and exciting game play - all under the story-rich umbrella of the Ravenloft setting.  A+ for the components - the miniatures are awesome and the tiles are sturdy.  Despite the limited amount of scenarios for characters to run through (which there are plenty of, to start with), the randomness of the dungeon tile placement gives the game decent replay value.

Playing solo is very tough. Luck is huge in this game - roll poorly and you will die and there's nothing you can do about it. Draw the wrong combination of tiles and cards and you will die and there's nothing you can do about it... except roll exceptionally well (which means consistent hits for the good guys and consistent misses for the bad guys). However, when you get multiple heroes on the board, their powers combine extremely well and you have a very fun fighting chance. The monsters are mostly undead and other night beasties (wolves, rats, spiders) so while they're thematically strong they're also the most specific of the 3 games, but they add a whole lot of welcome variety when mixed into the monster decks for the other games. (Weird note: Handling the rubbery plastic monsters during the game leaves a funny feel and smell on your fingers.)

Nice streamlined version of D&D - not too complex and not too simplified. I enjoy this a lot and it is a game that will always see play for me. Great components and lots of them. The 5 additional scenarios on FFG website are highly recommended (2 official and the 3 competition winners).

I prefer this to WA and Drizzt due to the traditional D&D setting - you battle undead such as skeletons and zombies and the heroes are a traditional cleric, wizard, rogue, warrior and ranger.

My only dislike is the way that monsters always get to attack first - would have been cool if sometimes they don't attack the same turn you discover them.

For what I expected, the game disappointed me. It was a desperate struggle to stay alive as monster after monster came hurtling towards our team. I enjoyed playing, but felt there needed to be a lot more tactical strategy to make this a great game. The strategy as is boils down to trying to explore as much as possible to reduce the monster onslaught. The random nature of exploring is where the game really feels lacking.The constant pressure of feeling like we are about to die was quite compelling, however.

This one is so maddeningly hit-or-miss for me.  I love the play time, the production is wonderful, and the theme is appealing.  I can run through a scenario in under an hour and it is solitaire friendly (no DM).  It seems like it should be a home run for me.  Unfortunately there are some disappointing design choices.  The way that the monsters spawn makes the game predictable and repetitive.  The encounter cards all do pretty much the same thing.  Finally, there is no art on the treasure or encounter cards (don't tell me WOTC doesn't have a ton of stock fantasy art).  That said, I still like it.  It just seems like it was 85% where I wanted it to be, which is frustrating.

Update: I have made my peace with the design choices and I am enjoying the game for what it is - a fast playing, light dungeoncrawler that plays well solo.

Castle Ravenloft is a very decent dungeon crawler with an auto DM that actually works. Very nice components and character powers. A very tough game to beat, either solo or with multiple players! Solo option works well too, so extra points there! Rulebook leaves so much to be desired, a real gaping hole sort of rulebook with lacking designer support on many clarifications. Very thematic, with enough random things happening in terms of mechanics that it keeps this from being a great game. But it's a good game for what it is.

RATING: 2
I have recently become attracted to the idea of games which offer solo-play experiences and co-operative play.  I don’t mind juggling numerous roles or simply figuring out a puzzle, as long as the game is either rich in theme or mechanically sound.  So after the enjoyment Defenders of the Realm provided I was excited by the prospect of a dungeon crawler which I could enjoy alone as well as with a group.  So I decided Ravenloft would be my next purchase.  The buzz about the game is pretty loud; so much so, that when a negative review came out the poster was ran off (ending with them deleting the post).  A game defended so passionately by such ardent fans coupled with repeated praise of the game play made Ravenloft a sure bet.  How I was wrong.
I will not go through a component, or rules breakdown as at this point it would only serve redundancy (check out the many other reviews).  What I will do is highlight the elements of Ravenloft which lead it to be what I find a vacuous game with no true decisions, and tiring repetitive game play.  
I have played through a few scenarios now, and nothing ever changes.  Ravenloft consists of a very simplified decision tree that basically runs on a very predictable autopilot for both the game system AI and for all the players.
  
MONSTERS:

Monsters are drawn every time a tile is laid.  The monster always has initiative and moves and attacks the closest hero (this never changes).  Although the monsters have wonderfully crafted miniatures to accompany their cards this is simply nothing more than aesthetic appeal.  All creatures react, and play the same.  Is there a difference?  The number of hit points one suffers.

PLAYERS:

You can attack and move, move then attack, or move twice.  However, because the AI is as such, you are most likely (with rare deviation) going to attack then move.  Rinse and repeat.
The only real decision to make is which of your powers you wish to use during your hero phase.  The powers however are all very similar, and if you have a strong one it will be saved until the final villain.  I have found it to be that players usually select the highest hitting non-exhausting power the majority of times.  To me this reduces what is really the only decision in the game to zero.
  
THEME:

This was one of the main draws for me.  Sadly Ravenloft offers very little.  The absence of significant choices, the scripted feel of all scenarios, the repetitive and predictable AI all detract from the experience.  There is no sense of exploration, no sense of sending in stronger units and holding back the frail.  No sense of developing a plan or strategy against the dark forces within the castle.  The way the AI is built, either monster movement or encounter, encourages constant movement.  It makes no sense to sit back as the result is worse, usually, than if you have to get slapped by a tile placed beasty.  

VARIETY:

With all scenarios playing out the same, all characters feeling awfully similar (powers are just tiny variations on one another), deterministic tile draws (you know when the end will appear), and no real game play decisions I find Ravenloft offers very little variety.  Therefore it also offers very little value and very little desire to be replayed.  

CONCLUSION:

Ravenloft is a major disappointment.  I have never felt so powerless over dice rolls than I do playing this game.  Usually there are decisions involved, and ways to work around rolls – not here.  I realize the franchise tie-in has many excited but this game strips everything to the most bare bones and leaves nothing other than some cool miniatures.  Very little game play, very little theme, and very little fun.

RATING: 6
A very light cooperative dungeon exploration game.  It's moderately fun to play but lacks depth due to the scope of the play time. 

Edit: for all the "light" appeal this game has, my 8-year-old rarely takes it out and I haven't cracked it open in months.  There's just something fundamentally unsatisfying with how the game is constructed, both in it's minimalist aesthetics and the flavor of the adventures.  Some of the boss battles are fun, but the minute complexities they add to the game really should have been implemented in more of the enemies.

Sold it.

Okay, I'm a huge fan of D&D 3.5 edition, despite its many flaws ... D&D 5e has returned to its roots while 4e was utter failure, in my opinion. That said, the D&D board games are [i]exactly[/i] what 4e should've been all along!

I've always loved the Dungeons & Dragons board games. They bring flavor and dungeon crawling to the table in an easily digestible package. For a while, however, they ended up taking the back seat to other games in my collection (or on my wish list) since I did not get to play them as often as I would like. But then I started playing these games more and more with my kids and their glory returned to the table once more!

These games are interesting, challenging, and captivating, whether you win or lose. And, let's be honest — this particular game is hard!

Very good game but may never get to the table due to requirements.

I enjoy this, and my wife hates this type of game.  She only see's random things hapening and has little "investment" in the character she is controlling.  Often asks am "I dead yet" hoping it will be over, and underlining the disinterest of the events and rules immune to the flavor I try to add.

I hope to play it many more times, the bad part is I will need to find gamers that will want to try a game like this out who will enjoy this sort of thing but wont see this as primitive and limiting (and who aren't going to take over the party.)

Yea, I know it has single player... but that isn't why I have board games as a hobby, otherwise I would play some computer RPG experience.

I love this game. It's a lot of fun to play and easy to learn/teach, but I must admit that I wish it was a little deeper, with some heavier rules. Things like line of sight, random encounter of unknown amounts of monsters. Rather than having an encounter on just about every turn and the same thing for monster spawns. It just gets a little repetitive with the constant monster spawns and encounters.

I'm hoping they change these few things and add a little more depth to the game in the next releases. I can still play this one over and over again. Even with these few dislikes, because it's just that much fun.

There are so many negatives to this game...and yet enough positives that keep drawing me back to playing it!

It is absolutely one of my go-to solitaire games. Probably the only dungeon crawl I have that allows me to do so. It can get pretty intense keeping track of everything when you're playing multiple characters, fighting a boss with minions, and drawing encounter cards all at the same time.

The components are a mixed bag. The minis are great. I think the tiles and cards aren't as bad as others say...they're on the plain side, sure, but when you're trying to keep track of everything that's going on, the simplicity works in it's favor.

The components also double perfectly if you want to use them for an RPG.

I would call this a sand-box game. It can be whatever you want to do with it!

Keep in mind. The rating reflects what the game IS...not so much what it could be.

Accepting that D&D Adventure Systems games are nothing more than co-ops that heap abuse like all other good co-ops goes a long way toward enjoying them. Don't expect the openness of role-playing. You can get out the D&D books for that. Don't expect mercy either. Castle Ravenloft is relentless like Ghost Stories, but at least it offers room to run away! It also offers fog of war, a modular board, and spatial dungeon crawling most co-ops don't. I didn't like it at first, but it may be a keeper after all.

Probably the best coop game I've played (better than Knights of Camelot, Cthulhu, Lord of the Rings and that space game where the bad dude in the middle tries to wipe out all the players.)

If you like D&D and are in a coop mood this 45 minute in length game will scratch a bit of your RPG itch.  I don't know how many times it can be played with out it becoming tired but I figure you could get a good 10+ plays in before you'd want to retire it for a year or so.

I think this one of the best games for those players with a wish to experiment D&D type of game.
If you are an experienced player looking for a game this one ain't for you.

I have played a few of the original scenarios with the number of players varying between 2 and 5. The game isn't difficult to learn and after that goes pretty fast. Another good thing is you don't need a dungeon master (DM) in order to play it. You'll have plenty of opportunities to interact with the rest of the players trying to figure out the best move/action etc.

The games come in a pretty neat box which allows you to store everything: cards, miniatures, board modules.
Monster miniatures are of good quality and easily identifiable. Hero miniatures are all the same color, thus a difficult to see who is who, but you'll find differences between them that help with identification. Not much of a graphical aspect to board and cards, but that didn't stop me having fun.

Of course there are things that can be improved. All in all i say this is a good game.

I was a little unsure about this game at first as I played the first two scenarios several times with various people (they are the recommended starting scenarios after all).  I felt that the game was somewhat repetitive and favored dumb luck over strategic gameplay.  After having dug into some "new" scenario's over the last couple of days, I quickly found that while sometimes dumb luck can put a damper on things, the strategy is enhanced when you get into certain situations.  This game isn't about setting up the ideal match.  It's about making due with what you've got in the situation your in, and that's an awesome game mechanic.  I'm exceptionally pleased with my purchase of CR, and am eagerly awaiting the delivery of the next game in the series, WoA.

Co-op DM-less dungeon crawl action will always suck me in.
After a read through the rules, I'm not sure what all the complaints are about.
One concern for me is the quality of the cardboard; with a modular tile system such as this they will wear fast. The cards are also really thin, flimsy, and cheaply made.

With WotC having such deep pockets, and such a high price tag, I expected quality on par with FFG games. This one clearly is not, at least in the cardboard, and card department.
The quality of the minis certainly makes up for any lack of quality in the cardboard, being much better sculpted than the standard FFG fare.

The rules are simple and man does this game play quick for the genre. A coop dungeon crawl that takes less than 2 hours; simply amazing.
It could be more in depth, but in doing so, play time would thus increase. Certainly some compromises were made to reduce complexity, but it does not detract from the fun. If it's a fast and furious coop dungeon crawl you're after, then you may have just found it in this game.

Another excellent point is the fact that this game is essentially a toolkit for creating your own scenarios, which is a huge boon over nearly every other dungeon crawl out there.
Why?
Because of the random nature of the game, and the way in which the danger is mitigated, even the scenario designer will not have any advantage over one who has not played any particular scenario. Not only that, but the system allows for one to create new scenarios (with specific rules and end games) very quickly and easily; which cannot be said of Descent or it's ilk, including Warhammer Quest. Although this one feels a lot more like a puzzle to be optimally solved in a certain way, than a true dungeon crawl.

A good dungeon crawl, although lacking the character progression.

Initial rating is low simply because I pretty much hate everything but the no DM system. It works fairly well and I hope it gets used in other games of this type. My group is urging me to give it a few more chances just to see if we like it better, we all WANT to like it, so far it's just not clicking with us. I would go so far as to say I honestly hate it so far. Possible future trade.

I can't get over how good this game is. I've played D&D since the 1978 basic set through to 3.5 a fair few years back and several boardgames along those lines, but this is a great, fast, tense dungeon game with a beautiful and elegant rule set. It has all the D&D bits (fighters, clerics, wizards, rogues, spells, skills, feats, hit points, monsters, traps, curses, etc). It captures the feel of our typical dungeon delve, where the party's resources would gradually deplete as we ran out of healing and/or spells and it became a race to either escape or complete whatever our mission was. You can't hang around in Castle Ravenloft, but keep pushing on to get to the Big Bad or Get Whatever It Is Done.
A typical game lasts only about a dozen turns or so, easily playable in an hour. (If you think about it, that's probably only 2 minutes elapsed time for the characters!). You can even play it solo. No DM!

This is a pretty basic dungeon crawler.  I was not a 4E fan, but it actually works well for a game like this.  (4E is way too simplified for our roleplaying group, but it does make a nice light board game.)  The figures are a nice touch, They actually clean up and look very nice when painted.  It works well both as a co-op crawler and a solo game.  I wish there was a bit more to leveling up and that it played with a bit more of a campaign feel, but there are fan made rules that add some of those features.  Overall, this is a nice crawler for a simple game with players of varying levels.

2010: If this game were just simplistic, I might be okay with it. But it's just so paint-by-numbers predictable. One does not play an adventurer here, one steps on things, triggering other things.

2016: What a difference six years makes. I have done time with many dungeon crawlers since last writing my review, and I was a real Goldilocks about them. This one is too competitive, this one just a tad too finicky, etc.

Then, I picked up Ravenloft again recently, and it all just clicked in a way it didn't before. It helps that the system's so moddable and re-iterated. I don't think I need another system, unless it's to play the actual RPG, which this game also helps.

Got a chance to play and had fun.  Played the first solo game to get a feel for it and lost with the stairs insight.  Won the second and third with a group of five.  We got beat up really bad in adventure 2 but didn't even use a healing surge in adventure 3.  Lots of fun, can be hard at times but my nephews and I enjoyed the game.  Now I want to get Wrath of Aschedalon.

RATING: 5
This should be right up my alley, but there seem to be some rules ambiguities, that my game group keeps trying to exploit.  Also the constant drumbeat of encounter cards seems to make progress very difficult.  We had 5 players, so even with exploring new tiles we still had to draw cards at least half the time.  Are we interpreting the frequency of Encounter cards incorrectly?  We were even using all 5 healing surges, since we got wiped out so early in our first attempted scenarios (only supposed to use 2).

It's likely we're not synergizing powers, healing, exploration speed, and group formation.  I'm playing with a DnD 3.5 group that's used to a lax DM, so they can run around and screw off during encounters.  Playing with them is like herding cats, and I think this title REALLY needs a group who can play cooperatively rather than selfishly.  Eh, maybe I need to try with a new group.  I hope to do so later this month.  I hope the game that is there can shine through, and perhaps find that the encounter cards are in fact more balanced rather than, "oh look I lost more hit points".  I'm keeping my fingers crossed.  As it is, I'm not looking forward to playing this again with my standard group. 

UPDATE:  Played a couple more times.  My opinion hasn't improved really.  Our last scenario actually seemed too easy.  The others have been complete losses, and the last (treasure hunt) was a cake walk, with no real challenge to it.  Again, we might have been counting treasures incorrectly.  Do we discard used treasures, or do they still count toward victory conditions?  Scenario book wasn't clear.  Do starting treasures count toward VC's?  Again, confusing.  We probably counted incorrectly as it was simply too easy to obtain 12 treasures and leave before Straad appeared.  Right or wrong, I probably won't actively seek to play this again in any case.  It's just seems to be missing that certain something.

RATING: 6
Fast-paced, simplistic dungeon crawl, but in this case, somewhat too simplistic. Strategy is usually transparent, and tactics are limited, especially after "daily powers" are used. I like the ability to select some of the character's powers (daily, utility powers). Even so, the options are often very limited. Additionally, the lack of depth in monster cards is disappointing - unless combined with other games (Dungeon Command cards help substantially). Theme and presentation are nice, but overall, the game system lacks substance. Limited to light play, but does fill that niche fairly well.

I was really excited when I found out this game was coming out and I did enjoy the few times I played solo and with 2 or 3 players, though i still haven't tried it with more.  However, since joining a D&D 4th edition Dark Sun campaign, my interest in playing this game has dropped off almost completely.  I think that I'd try it with a larger group of inexperienced gamers (4 or 5 of us) because I think co-op games are suited to that set up. However, I imagine I'd rather be playing Pandemic if that were the case, unless they wanted to learn more about D&D. Fantastic components though, for the price.

Okay, wow. Amazing job on streamlining the dungeon crawl, guys! This game is the anti-Descent--quick, deadly, and fast-moving. The monster movement abstraction is bloody brilliant. 
A lot of the mechanics are perhaps too simplistic for my tastes, but the alternative fixes would probably make the game too cumbersome and unwieldy. As it is, this is easily the second-best dungeon crawl I've ever played (after Mage Knight Dungeons).
[EDIT] The subsequent entries in the series are vastly preferable, as they have improved both in terms of rules and (for my tastes) theming.

This is one that I was very interested in trying out, so when it came out at our game day, I was very interested in getting a chair at that table.

Played the intro quest with 5 ppl, and ultimately -- I just wasn't that impressed.  We won the quest, but even so -- I think I only got to roll an attack 3 times, and it was a lot of sitting around.  As the fighter (tank), I had very little opportunity to actually _be_ the tank, since my (faster) teammates kept racing ahead in order to keep exploring and avoid drawing the encounter cards. 


Just a really weird pacing to the game, and it felt very rushed with sadly few interesting opportunities for tactical cooperation.

Might be better with fewer people, but I didn't really enjoy it with 5.

Update: Acquired a copy of my own -- interested in giving it another shot.

D&D lite. 4th ed with the role play stripped out. What 4th ed was really trying to be all along, and the board game is much stronger for it. Its fantastic. 
A relatively short session per adventure has tense and exciting moments in spades. Highs and lows all the way. Awesome fun. 
A great D&D fix for a long retired AD&D'er such as myself. 
But the appeal is just as strong for the missus' lad who is  a 3.5/Pathfinder player. Very highly recommended. 

More than playable with my 7&9 yr olds also, magic. Still have Ashardalon and Drizzt and the fan made card decks to add yet!

Since I quite liked Wrath of Ashardalon, even though I rarely got to play it, I picked this up in great condition secondhand.
I quite enjoy it when playing with others, but it's not as good a solo experience as, say, Legend of Andor. Doesn't seem much scope for strategy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Having only played a scenario in each, I really can't comment on whether this or Wrath of Ashardalon is better other than to say that dragons are obviously cooler than vampires. These D&D board games function as a very stripped-down version of a D&D dungeon crawl (devoid of any real role-playing). I find Descent to be a much more enjoyable experience as I think the presence of a player Overlord and the increased tactical options add a lot. However, the game length obviously suffers for it, so this is a game you can play a lot faster than Descent.

Each player gets a hero, makes some choices about starting skills and abilities, and heads into the dungeon to start exploring. Tiles are revealed from the stack, each containing a monster with its own scripted AI that it follows (generally running towards the nearest hero and trying to kill it). Combat is handled with a single roll of the d20, compared to the armor class of the target, damage value reduces target's hit points, end of turn. Each player also controls some monsters that move at the end of their turns, mainly following the AI script, but with a few player choices as well. Each game is scenario-based, so the goals and tile layouts will be a little different each time, often even within the same scenario. Working together, the players will find treasure, kill monsters, and hopefully save the day. 

The components are a mixed bag. It's an enormous box, chock-full of tiles, tokens, and plastic. However, the cards themselves, while of high quality, are very bland to look at. When you find a sword, you don't get to see a picture of it (despite the publisher's extensive library of D&D artwork they could have easily used), you get to see a bunch of text. Similarly, the plastic figures are provided unpainted, despite the fact that the publisher also manufactures painted versions. Players wanting to replace their unpainted versions with painted ones by tracking down single D&D Minis will often be halted by the high prices of some of the rarer ones. Even if it was cost prohibitive to provide these in the base game, the publisher certainly had the ability to offer a full set of painted minis separately, which would have helped out its consumers significantly. The game really comes alive using the painted minis. 

I am someone who often doesn't like co-operative games. I see them as nothing more than a group optimization puzzle, or in some cases sheer randomness with only an illusion of control. Because of this, they either lose their flavor once "solved", or simply feel like a pointless waste of time. But these games really are my favorite co-ops ever because they avoid these pitfalls. Yes it is possible to get better at the game, but this is mainly by knowing the monsters and items. And yes, randomness will determine a lot of your success or failure. But because the theme and story are so important, you don't really mind this. Ultimately, this is what D&D is all about: story over gameplay. It really works well here.

Very light and fast playing game. Zip through the dungeon, kill them and take their stuff. A quest/objective resolves at the end.

The turn sequence is a nice balancing effect for the number of players, but leads to quite bland group tactics (and thus blurred roles) and separate monsters instead of groups, which is unlike the traditional dungeon delving experience. 

Couple that with a rather unattractive set of bits, an absent theme... that's a huge letdown.

A good cooperative game. I think this is the best of the three D&D Adventure system games. The BGG community also has made a lot of content for this game, which adds to replayability. The gameplay can be a little repetitive and the luck factor plays a major role, but you have to make some decisions to overcome that.

A miniatures D&D game where each player is moving a dude around a dungeon in order to fulfill some victory condition before heading for the exit.  Decent for what it is but nothing I would actively seek out to play.

RATING: 8
Only played Adventure 2 "The Icon of Ravenloft" so far, but, so far at least, the game lives us to my expectations.  The rules are simple, the gameplay is fast and relatively tense and it looks pretty on the table. I imagine the rating could go up or down a point after I've played another half dozen games.

My only real concern at the moment is that it appears that running from monsters and revealing as many tiles as possible may be the most effective strategy.  I hope not - perhaps a lot depends on the victory conditions for the individual scenarios.

Could use a bit more variety to enemies and treasures. Encounter events are a bit annoying, but since some of them can be cancelled with XP and powers, seems somewhat acceptable. Lots of 'player decides' situations, so fertile grounds for custom rules, which I like.

All in all, I feel there's a bit too little the player can affect, so a little undecided on whether I like this or not. Might want to try combining with the other sets in future.

This is about as close to 4th Edition [i]D&D[/i] as I'm willing to get.  I hear the first row gets soaked—is this true?  I brought a +1 rain poncho just in case.

UPDATE:  I just watched [i]Ravenloft[/i] curb-stomp [i]Descent[/i] in the alley behind the dumpster.  I'd call the cops, but I'd really rather not get involved.

UP-UPDATE:  Full of High-Fantasy-meets-Gothic-Horror goodness.  Like a vampire sucking on a hobo it's a simple meal with a very strong flavor.

This title is a great addition to any gaming collection and role playing collection alike.

My favorite cooperative game.  Best with 2 players, each player controlling 2 heros.  The game drags a bit with more than 2 players, as there is a bit of down time when other players take their turn- it's best if you have a group that likes to strategize together. The game is a 10 for fun factor, and the 13+ scenarios provide a great range of easy to hard challenges.  Hard challenges are hard to win, but always fun. Takes 60 to 90 minutes per game including set-up/ take down time if all your bits are organized.

My rating is based on two plays.  The game is pretty simple compared to some of the other dungeon crawl games out there.  Plus, I don't get stuck playing as the game master like I do in Descent.  Our first adventure seemed somewhat easy, overall.  Things got a bit hairy to begin with, but as we figured out the system, we had an easier time of it.  My teenage son, who is already a gamer, enjoyed it a lot and has taught several of his friends.

RATING: 8
Fantastic game that's simple and streamlined that it's a relief after all those FFG rulebooks I usually have to work through. The game play is well balanced and it comes down to the wire towards the end, however it may be easier with more heroes. It's also quick to get through compared to Descent which is our other dungeon crawl game. We can play multiple adventures or different games in the same time that we might not have been able to finish a descent game.

I like it. I'm not a regular RPG'er, but this satisfies the itch for a quick dungeon hack'n'slash. somehow reminds me of a boardgame version of nethack or rogue from the PC days of yore...

A bit 'more' would have been nice as an optional campaign/character development to provide more depth when desired. However I do actually like the relatively shallow and quick treatment of the standard scenarios - good for a 'filler' when I don't have a lot of time to devote to a game - which is what most of my gaming sessions are now.

The game is cruel as hell. You get sucker-punched by monsters every turn. Traps and encounters grind the party down... but still, you are having fun. CR lightly scratches the Warhammer Quest itch, as well as the dungeon crawler itch (athough it is much more a cooperative game than a DC - and in this case the terms are mutually exclusive) in a much shorter time than most of DC-type games.

Also: smashing components!

Well after reading up on this one it is [i]exactly[/i] what I expected(It pays to do homework...). I have been waiting about 8 years to play a decent DM-less dungeon game and have always wanted to play WHQ but never bit the bullet on ebay so can't compare. 

Overall I think they did a decent job here, especially considering that games can play in about an hour (which is QUITE a limitation design-wise) and it ends up being [i]fairly[/i] satisfying in the end even though lots of elements from actual D&D are really missing. I was worried about all these elements being left out but now after playing I'm not sure how much I care anymore (though I plan to add some back in...). The system feels complete the way it is mostly, for what it is, and does what it was designed to do, which is give you a basic low rules overhead and short game time dungeon game, and for what it is it's good in that regard. Note my rating is for a 2 or 3 player game, I never bother playing these kind of very low decision games with more than that. 

Call me crazy but to me anyway it almost scratched the same itch as Pandemic (probably more so Defenders but I haven't played it), that could be either good or bad for some people but I guess most people won't even get this feeling at all since mechanic-wise and theme-wise they ARE worlds apart. See I did say ALMOST and they are completely different games of course but it is a co-op game that plays in an hour where you are trying to beat the system and stop stuff from spreading (in this case monsters). Also, decisions are somewhat limited, [i]sometimes[/i] obvious and luck will often be a factor in winning or losing. So in those ways and those ways ONLY, it kind of scatches the same itch for ME, I could buy this and essentially trade away Pandemic (which I am seriously thinking about) but thats just me. I dont like to keep too many games around that do the mostly the same thing, you may not care at all and they are really completely different but I just thought I would throw that out there anyway (for the record I do like this much more but I am biased due to theme...) 

So is it a replacement for Descent?  That depends of course; for the people that can't get that to the table, yeah it could be as this is much easier to pick up and play and it gives you a dose of the same flavour. For those that want a full and rich experience, likely it won't be as this is very automated in comparison. They really do scratch different itches in that regard even though they have the same theme and that is where I was kind of going in the prior paragraph, this doesn't really feel like a true RPG adventure game and how could it playing in one hour and with no campaign rules, it does do an excellent job given that time limitation however, expectations are important here. So this is a fast and furious dungeon romp, nothing too deep (read decisions very much on the light side), EASY to pickup and play, no DM needed, and you do get the feeling of exploring a dungeon and killing off monsters for treasure. Descent is much much more elaborate and rich in its approach (though its also missing things for me) but as such not as approachable in more than one sense. Really due to their MAJOR differences they almost shouldn't even be compared, they just share the same theme. WHQ is a more apt comparison and I still haven't played (read over rules) however I do know it needs houserules to be a decent game and is much more involved than CR. To me it looks like WHQ with tweaks is better than CR (with tweaks) and CR is better than Heroquest, from my experience with HQ.  

More to that end and to summarize, I think my biggest knock on this game is its biggest strength, the automation and time to play. In order to have a richer experience the time to play would have to be extended (yes little tweaks can improve this game and stay in one hour but I want more than that as do many others), more rules would have to be added and you would need someone playing the bad guys (though the last point is debatable...). OTOH, a game like that already exists but goes on too long for most people (even me mostly though RTL helps) and running into 4 hours or more means you might as well play actual D&D in many cases. So in the end I'm kind of torn on this one for now, houserules and variants could really add to the game which means to me there is STILL a BIG hole in the genre for the middle ground (a 2 hour rich experience is very possible). I like this game for sure, its good at what it sets out to do, a fast DM-less dungeon romp that you could even play with your spouse or kids but at the same time it feels like the game kind of plays itself (another Pandemic parallel) to some degree (which of course it has to to a large extent with no DM) and it lacks some overall variation and richness which makes it a little too predictable and repetitive leaving you wanting something more (a monster on every tile is anticlimatic etc, I plan on tweaking things like this though and I here some of the scenarios up this ante a bit). The game mostly did keep me interested while playing (let's see how I feel in game 5, might be kind of samey), combat was simplified but alright, items/treasure were interesting but lacking somewhat and it's a great value for 50 bucks but I do wonder how long this title could keep my interest and this is where fan-made stuff [i]might really[/i] help (and I know I'll be coming up with my own ideas too and adding them). Also note, I think games like Prophecy, Runebound, Spacehulk etc just aren't really my thing, they leave me wanting more. If you're not willing to tweak the game, becareful what you expect out of a one hour co-op D&D game; how much can really happen in a game that plays to completion in an hour.... 

[u]UPDATE:[/u] - Have not played WHQ but read over the rules and looked through the roleplaying and adventure book. WHQ is the real deal, it needs a few tweaks but looks very very good. CR is actually a boiled down version, there are several definite similarities and CR basically took [i]some[/i] of the great parts, simplified them, threw in some 4E stuff and made a game from that which plays in an hour. For some people, this will be the cat's meow, an hour very easy to play crawler is a great thing. For others who want more and still don't want a DM, WHQ is where to get it.   

[u]UPDATE:[/u] I still think Warhammer Quest will be much better than this is but I played a game of this the other day with quite a few small rule changes and it turned out quite enjoyable and MUCH better than the rules as written which are dull and repetitive in comparison. Putting some tension and intrigue back in the game makes a great difference in feel, I think this will save the game for me (from the trade pile). I'll post them soon, it shares some of the ideas that other variants posted have but also introduces a few new things as well and is very simple to implement overall. Rating with tweaks 7 or 7.5

An exercise in little else but "when will the next event card kill me?" Enjoyed Drizzt quite a bit more but that one stands a bit more on the easy side than I'd like.

Only played a few times to be fair (although those few times simply made me not care to play again).

RATING: 7
This is a "dungeon crawl" style game where the "dungeon" isn't really the kind that most think of, relatively empty with a few monsters and some treasure waiting for the players to find. This is an armed fortress of a castle owned by one of the really big baddies from the D&D universe, the vampire Strahd. Character's entering the dungeons beneath Strahd's castle should expect him to put up a ton of resistance... and he does.

Going with this, the game is extremely harsh and players should not expect to win easily. A bad run of encounter or monster cards has the potential to be absolutely devastating. This can be extremely frustrating and may be too much for some players.

That said, this difficulty also makes the game incredibly tense (a good thing) and successfully finishing a game by overcoming particularly difficult challenges gives a huge sense of accomplishment. Games are also relatively short to play at about an hour per game, so re-playing after a particularly disastrous run is very easy to do.

The game is also immensely re-playable with no two games being the same, even two games of the same scenario. The dungeon is created and stocked randomly giving a very "rogue-like" feel to the game.

Overall I think this is a really excellent game and can see myself playing this for a long time to come. Possible classic here.

One play took it from 'love to have' on my wishlist, to off my wishlist. Now, that's not to say I didn't enjoy the game, because I did, but it didn't do what I had hoped it would do.

I had hoped this would give me more of a story feeling, more of a D&D adventure feeling, but everything (the dungeon, the encounters, the monsters) was so random that it could have been any game.

25.10.2010: Whooo! This is the game I wanted [i]Descent[/i] to be, a fast-paced alternative to [i]Dungeons & Dragons[/i]. The game really is playable in an hour, and that's a great thing for us parents with limited time to play games. And it's clearly related to [i]D&D 4th Edition[/i], so it can be used as a stepping stone into "real" [i]D&D[/i] as well.

A pretty straight forward dungeon crawl as we have no previous experience with the D&D genre... What's up with all the first-strike Monster(s) on every tile?... while some can inflict 1 damage even after a complete miss?  Gotta have my Lucky Charm.  This remains a 'keeper' for my son's collection.

Painted minis would have been nicer.

Better than Descent? I don't know, I haven't played Descent. But yes this is better than Descent. The game actually knows when you are rolling dice for yourself or for the monsters, it's pretty amazing. DNA tampering? Must investigate further.

Didn't win first (solo) scenario until play 5. Had been playing it wrong all that time (laying tiles as hero moved)!

Enjoyed playing the first few times, not a fan of the combat mechanics. Usually boils down to finding a new enemy, it attacks you, next player kills it and finds a new enemy, rinse, repeat. The game felt like it had too much of a clock and wasn't random enough. Quality of the pieces is impressive and definitely usable for d&d sessions. Most of the games had a twist to them that made it enjoyable, but I had my fill of the game.

This game certainly has a “cool factor” going for it.  But I’m hesitant after one play.  The mission seemed far too easy.  There were 4 of us and there was never a point where we felt desperate or a time when one of us almost died.  Toward the end a lot of monsters came on the board, but my friend used his daily spell that allowed him to cast a hoard of villagers and all the monsters chased after them, leaving us alone and unscathed at the other end of the board.  But this was only one play and that may have been an uncommon outcome.  The art and minis are great.  It’s cool to select which powers you want to take, though I think they will need to add a lot more variety in this area.  We’ll see after more plays.

UPDATE: I have sold this because I played it a lot and I like the updated mechanics in Drizzt. I think this game is probably better than Drizzt for newcomers, due largely to better scenarios.

This is not a deep game but it does have lots of tactical decision making. This is standard fare for dungeon crawl games which I love so this doesn't bother me at all.

There are several very cool mechanics in this game. The automated dungeon is very well done with monster and environment cards popping up to offer challenging opposition.

The scenarios are diverse and the difficulty ramps up considerably. I don't think I've won the final conflict yet.

There some reasons why people might not like this game. It does suffer from Alpha-gamer syndrome, and even without that many decisions feel like they are being made by committee. The D20 and card draws add a fair bit of luck to the system.

RATING: 6
As a former D&D player from years gone by (as in the original red box) - with a wife that expresses no interest whatsoever in ever attempting RPGs - Ravenloft satisfies my needs without pushing her into territory that she's uncomfortable with. Co-op play is always a benefit for us as a couple, and I for one definitely appreciate the ability to exercise a bit of RP during the game. Exceptional minis and gameplay that's streamlined just enough to keep things moving along well without losing the D&D flavour.

RATING: 4
This game is frustrating. Not fun. But leaves you thinking that with a few changes it may work. And you can actually find many fan-made variants online (including this site). Despite this imperious need to be "fixed", the game has some mechanics that I like.

For example, I really like the mechanics for monster generation and activation. Basically, monsters appear by drawing "monster cards". The player who found the monster takes its card, and that monster's turn always takes place after the player's turn. It really creates nice alternations of turns between heroes and monsters that reminds me of DnD combat.

Overall the game does a good job giving that DnD feeling. However, there's a couple of things that go directly against that. Whenever a hero doesn't "explore" a new tile, the player draws an "encounter card". Those cards have negative effects that usually affect all heroes in the same tile where the active hero is. This causes to be safer to split the party than to advance into the dungeon as a group (DON'T SPLIT THE PARTY!!). Another big thing going against the spirit of DnD is that there is no "campaign mode" that allows you to level up and better equip your character in the course of several games.

I find plenty of issues with the art in this game. First, although the sculpts of the miniatures are generally good, their scale (especially the humanoid ones) differs between heroes, monsters and villains. And Kavan, represented by a token, could have been represented by a miniature as well. Second, the back side of encounter, treasure and monster cards are plain and uninspiring, and there are no illustrations even for items, environments or traps anywhere. And third, there is way too much unnecessary cardboard... I'll give some examples:

- Condition markers could have been printed both sides as Slowed/Immobilized markers. The same goes for Reaction tokens (Calm/Enrage).
- HP and Monster HP tokens could be the same, so you don't need two pools. Alternatively, the HP of the heroes could be tracked on top of their Hero card using only one token per hero.
- To have monster cards and monster tokens seems redundant to me, the designers should have just pick one mechanic and save paper or cardboard.
- Plenty of item tokens are only used once. Those tokens could have been easily showing numbers that one assign to specific items or whatever one wants.

Besides ecological aspects, all that cardboard only makes the game more expensive, gives a false impression of content and occupies space.

In summary, the game is a frustrating cooperative DnD-inspired fight-oriented random-generated ameritrash dungeon-crawler for kids.

I can see why this is enjoying such success on BGG, but I must just admit that I am not the target audience for a game like this.  I don't particularly enjoy fantasy themes and I don't have a real desire to play anything D&D related (though I wouldn't necessarily be opposed either).

I like that the game is relatively quick and that the rules are easy to digest.  This alone means that I would usually play this game, since many in this genre are too complicated for me.

However, I'm a little tired of cooperative games, and the majority of the outcomes do seem pretty heavily influenced by die rolls.  I am not opposed to dice and enjoy dice games in general, but here if you roll well you'll do well.  If you roll poorly you'll do poorly.  This is inexcusable in a long game, but in a game like this it's just a mild annoyance.

RATING: 6
I need to play this a few more times with multiple players.  As it stands, the rules feel strange and disjointed, almost as if they kept removing rules trying to make the game simpler and ended up going a bit too far.  However, it played better with multiple players in my last game, but it seems far too easy for the system to end up devolving into rote play and hoping not to get hit with too nasty of a series of encounters/monsters.

For some reason, even though it seems simple, at least for the first few games you end up drowned in components and it seems easy to forget rules, like you get a treasure after slaying a monster or that we probably shouldn't have characters walking on the coffins.  I might try to sort the components better so stuff always needed is better split from adventure items.  

There's also a lot of questions that seem to pop up that aren't addressed at all.  House rules were starting to pop up everywhere. An example was we'll allow trade for treasures if in same tile.   

While I've heard praise for the theme, it so far doesn't feel too much like the campaign setting.  I have a lot of materials from the various editions of the campaign setting, but I must admit I never played teh original D&D module.  I just can't help but wonder why they did Ravenloft to start and not something like Tomb of Horrors.

Walk down a grey corridor while an unimaginative card deck kills you randomly.

The "D&D Adventuring System" is:
1. One monster and one treasure per tile.
2. Random traps.
3. Random Environment
4. Random loss of hit points
5. Nothing else

The miniatures are nice, and I like the HP counters.
I came close to putting this in the garbage can.

In each quest, the objective tile is shuffled into a random location near the end. If it is near the beginning, you win, if it is at the end you lose.

Initial rating based on two plays of the solo mission.  Good solo/co-op dungeon crawl.  It's challenging (I didn't win in either of my first two plays, even using three health surges instead of two) and interesting.  It captures the feeling of a D&D adventure without needing a DM to go through the trouble of making one up.  The heroes are powerful and the monsters are deadly. It's easy to play and quicker than other dungeon crawls like Mage Knight or Runebound.

Ever watch an archer take careful aim, let loose the arrow, and the arrow follows a graceful arc right into the exact center of the haystack next to the target? That's Castle Ravenloft.

This has many elements of what could be a nice dungeon crawl adventure game, except for, well, the gameplay.

Let me review my choices for this turn. Well, I could take a swing at a monster...oh, there isn't actually any reason ever why I wouldn't take a swing at a monster. Okay, I could try to explore the next tile...oh, there isn't any reason why I wouldn't explore a tile if I could. Well, let's see what's on the tile, there might be a monster...oh, there's always a monster.

There are no choices in this game and the tiles are all the same. It only gets rated this highly because I can run through solo adventures, if you can really call them that.

I really didn't like the lack-luster card presentation but the game itself was ok.  Feels like each game in the series kept getting a little bit better and despite having gotten rid of these games for Descent 2.0 I have recently picked up the 4th one in the series (The Temple of Elemental Evil) as I hear it adds a campaign system and such.  It may be that I'll need to re-acquire these other games if that tips the scales enough in the positive.  I did play some D&D back in the day, not a lot, but I also played a ton of the gold box version computer games so I have intimate familiarity with the classes and spells and such.  From that nostalgic standpoint the game works fairly well and feels a bit like D&D from a combat standpoint anyway.

Quite hard. Especially encounter cards are really nasty. You rush through the map, because you have to draw encounter cards when you haven't revealed a new tile. Guess what, the tile you just revealed has you draw an encounter card...
Also didn't feel that overly cooperative. Group bonuses are marginal and only count when the heroes are on the same tile. And the cleric felt really underpowered in the healing department.

The leap from 4e D&D to a full-fledged boardgame is startlingly small. That being said, it also reminds me of playing the old Gauntlet video game, with fewer monsters and more traps.

After 3 plays, I found myself profoundly bored with the proceedings.  Very thin gameplay, not much of an immersive experience, and a few very clunky mechanics (tiles vs. squares, among others) have proved a major turnoff.

I do like the flavour of the game, but it is pretty unbalanced - in most of the scenarios the players have no chance when simply confronted with bad card draw (which happens most of the time because of the card distribution).

Good fully cooperative Dungeon Crawler more oriented toward boardgaming.At the end it has some german influence because you have to do an accurate HP management.You cannot count on healing like a normal GDR o DC you have to manage your HP and get to the end of the scenary as soon as possible(but without risking too much, if you're already in danger is better to try solving the situation before continuing the exploration),obviuously It all depends on mission for example in escaping missions you can even try to avoid some monsters...

Very funny even played alone as an escape the dungeon game. Probably CR is the best of the 3 games of the series because I founf WoA a little unbalanced and LoD a little too themed on drow and their abilities....

That said, something just didn't work for me so I hope they come out with a DragonLance version that I like better!

While several bad die rolls can really harm you and the graphical design of the cards aren't the best, this game has a ton of minis to really immerse you into the game, and there are lots of fanmade adventures to keep you busy. While the tiles are bit thinner than my liking don't have that much variety between them, that still did not detract from the overall feel that you were actually exploring through a dungeon, and you are punished for taking your time. Also, I'm not quite sure what it is about this game (maybe it's just my individual group) but alpha game syndrome seemed much less in this game than any other co-op I've played. Rules are extremely vague about a ton of things though.

EDIT: After about 15 plays the beginning slog of random monsters is starting to feel really samey,and I wish there was more differentiation between adventures. It doesn't help that the variety of monster types is limited by the minis.

thanks scope for introducing the game...  but not really my cup of tea...
feeled a bit like Ghost stories (a game i would run away) where you are always on the down side, getting beat up constantly with little hope of winning.  Most of the treasures give ur ability back (i want weapons & equipments!!) and nothing good every happens from encounter.  Overall i would rather play  my good old Hero Quest than this....

I raised my initial rating of a "5" to a "7" after a great session with the Dracolich and Howling Hag scenarios.  Both scenarios provided a tense game with some exciting die rolls towards the end.  This game kind of scratches the RPG itch with a minimal investment of time and simple ruleset.  I'm looking forward to the two Strahd scenarios.

This game is essentially a stripped down 4.0 rule set/minis; a good thing.

They created a really nifty monster AI system; a great thing.

It's totally coop without the need of a moderator; a great thing.

It can be played in 90 minutes or less with 5; an amazing thing.

Our first game was great! Looking forward to more. If you want a good dungeon crawl with all the D&D flavor in a short period of time, look no further.

The minis are also wonderful and seem ripe for replacement with their painted counter parts.

It's strange to me that it took this long for something as straightforward and effective as monster tactics cards, but here they are, and that is just one aspect that stands out in this amazing game.  The exploration is flawless and gripping.  The game tries to kill you without mercy; the monsters will always have the jump on you, unlike in Descent, when a room can be revealed and cleared before the next Overlord turn.  The lack of DM in this game is not felt, however.  Truly elegant design.

RATING: 5
Love the random dungeon generation and the potential in home brewing games when mixing all of the D&D Adventure games together. However, I don't have time or the will to create those house rules to elevate it to another level and therefore the game "out of the box" is too simple for my liking. Despite that it's a good gateway dungeon crawler.

RATING: 6
I really wanted to like this, but alas, could not.  The gameplay just wasn't that engaging.

On a more superficial note:  One day, I will find a fantasy-themed game that gets the artwork right.  I hate the busy opulence of the typical Fantasy Flight production, and the art in this game, when it exists, is uninspired to say the least.  I mean, if I pick up a magic amulet, can't I at least see a picture of the damned thing?

7/14/2017: 8 - Fun! Played it with our group of 4 of us - 2 were skeptical, but admitted it was more fun than they expected. It was exciting at times - one time we thought we were all gonna die cuz we were surrounding by monsters, but our Dragonborn Fighter pulled out  pulled out a successful mass attack! We ended up winning after using up both healing surges - both on the cleric (me), cuz the cleric was playing too aggressively. (Oops!) Excited to try it with 5 people next. (Maybe this could lead to me introducing more dungeon-crawling type games to the group.) Also, it shipped with one hero figure missing, and one hero figure bent. :( But contacted Wizards of the Coast, and they promptly sent replacements. :)

RATING: 6
An excellent cooperative game where players assume the role of D&D adventure archetypes.  This a DM-less game where you explore a dungeon and fight monsters and work to complete various scenarios.  Each challenge is different.

This is an excellent game and it is very good at 4 or 5 players.  2 or 3 just does not work well.  You are much more likely to lose at lower player counts on most scenarios.  You should just have a couple of players play 1 or 2 characters.  

This may be true for Ravenloft with the low player counts.  Other versions of the game may not have the issue. 

Even with this problem, I still like the game a lot.

RATING: 5.5
Basically, a dungeon-crawl, where players are put against the game itself. There is no GM using the monsters: their actions are determined by the rules themselves.
Personally, I don't see the point of such a game out of an RPG: if I wanted to play D&D, I'd be playing it.
If I wanted a dungeon-crawl table-top, I'd be playing something with better rules, such as Descent.
It's neither here nor there, for me.

Unless we are missing a crucial rule, my husband and I agree that the turn structure makes this game way too hard to be enjoyable. Movement/Action > Exploration > Villain means that you can never attack a monster on a turn it appears but it can always attack you. You also constantly dead-end yourself because exploration of a new tile can take place ONLY after you have finished all movement for the turn, so every monster you managed to leave behind you can easily catch up in a turn or two, and any monster on a newly revealed tile can attack you immediately. And, as if you actually needed an incentive to explore a new tile every turn, if you don't do so, you have to draw an encounter card that will add a trap or damaging condition to the tile you are on. So if you don't explore, the bad guys catch up with you and you add even more danger to your location. If you do explore a tile, the bad guys catch up with you, and you add a new bad guy to the board that gets to attack you right away while you can't do anything about it. The leveling up system is weird and stunted (you can only do it if you roll a 20!). While I understand this is a cooperative game, I also don't like the shared experience pool mechanic.

As someone who doesn't have a group to play the Dnd RPG with, Castle Ravenloft (and it's counterparts) is a great way to get engrossed in the DnD world. Even without a whole lot of room for character advancement, you can still customize the game to your liking. Each set comes with a number of quests laid out for you, but there are plenty of resources online for designing and running your own campaigns. As far as plastic figurines go, these are pretty fantastic. Dungeon delving with them is a blast.

Great dungeon crawl game.  D&D 4.0 was meant for board gaming, and this really shows it off.

Maybe I played it with the wrong group of folks, or maybe we played it wrong, or maybe we played a bad scenario, but honestly this one fell a little flat if you ask me.

Components are nice, mechanics seem fine, but there was just something missing. There was nothing super engrossing to keep everyones attention. It honestly was a struggle to just get to the end of the game and be done with it.

I really want to like this one, but other than offering 1 or 2 moments where you really need to think things through, there just isn't anything engaging about this co-op game. I would rather play a co-op game like Forbidden Island...at least with that one there is a good amount of table talk and tension for the group.

Ravenloft is by no means bad, and I may try to get it to the table again...but I have had more fun with other games...

RATING: 8
A cooperative adventure that takes competitive spirit and channels it into teamwork without much fuss. True to the spirit of Dungeons and Dragons board games, this scenario based adventure has somewhat limited replayability based on the few scenarios and character classes/cards shipped with the product.

Great value for the money however, a bevvy of cards, miniatures and tokens are included. Single player scenarios are unsually inferior and much less fun than multiplayer play.

I don't enjoy playing this game. At the risk of repeating all of the other criticisms out there, here are my thoughts...

The biggest problem is the rules don't feel like give the players any choices or control at all -- you either explore a new tile and trigger a monster  and possible an encounter, or you trigger an encounter (even if you're actively engaged in combat.) The monsters and encounters often include unavoidable damage. Most powers become exhausted after a single use and don't reset until you  manage to get one of the very few dedicated cards that reset them (even resetting on a natural 20 would feel more balanced and exciting.) This means that you end up choosing between your at-will powers for almost the entire game. And to make it worse, most of the powers don't have enough of an effect to merit their use. For example, one power allows you to push back a monster, but this doesn't in any way limit the monster's ability to attack you when it activates in almost all cases. So you might have well just used the at will power with the highest bonus to hit.

Speaking of bonuses, the monsters power seems quite arbitrary. Kobold skirmishers have +9, which means they hit the most heavily armored character on a 6 or something close to that. Really strange.

Any game I've played without the Cleric feels like punishment as opposed to a game. The items are unremarkable and often come with rules or limitations that make them feel weak.

The characters and their abilities are ripped right from the pages of D&D source material, so that shouldn't disappoint.

The quality of the components varies. For instance, the encounter, treasure, and item cards are terribly bland with no art. The monster cards have some art and are ok. The highlight being the interlocking room tiles and the miniatures which are nice enough to justify the purchase if you can get it for under forty bones, which shouldn't be too difficult.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A game that feels like it was designed with a focus on game mechanics, and then stapled on with a theme. It feels like very 'dry' as the game system just does not make it feel like you have options at all. Plus, the AI just isn't capable of providing the fun generated in previous D&D games that we used to know. Game mechanic-wise, the system works. Theme-wise, this game is very lacking. I feel that the need to make a fantasy RPG game available for both solo and group gamers, and playable in under an hour kills it for our gaming group.

I expected to be as turned off by 4e Lite as I was by 4e after a year of play, and was pleasantly surprised: It's like a streamlined Warhammer Quest, and is actually a lot of fun.

A large part of the fun comes from the fact that it's a dungeon in the grand Gygaxian tradition: weird and wicked hard. There's no organic monster placement, and very little of it actually makes sense, but it pulls no punches and gives you a real run for your money.

The presentation is top-notch, and I love the way the dungeon tiles interconnect.

A great game that works well both co-operatively and played solo and really captures the basic essence of those old-fashioned dungeon crawls whilst retaining enough strategic meat to make it feel like a board game.

A decent boardgame (pun only somewhat intended) that really doesn't bring much exciting to the 'dungeon crawl' genre.  It's rather simple, meaningful decisions are limited, and while some games I've played were close, it didn't feel quite as tense and exciting to me as others I've played in this genre.  The components are absolutely fantastic, however, and for D&D players (or even other fantasy roleplayers who like to use miniatures) that alone may be worth the price.

RATING: 7.5
I should start off by saying that I am not a fan of D&D, and never really played the RPG, but I do appreciate D&D for what its done for the RPG genre.  I do like RPGs in general, and dungeon crawls especially. 

Having said that, D&D:CR is a really fun co-op game, and quite different from the D&D RPG system (or at least the previous editions).  The game does have some flaws, but it is still a fun experience.  

The treasure cards aren't that great as most of them are useless (depending on the situation), and the game could've used more unique \ special tiles.  As is, most of the tiles are identical, and serve no special purpose.  A more in-depth leveling system could have also been nice.

I do, however, use coffin markers in all my games \ scenarios.  It makes some of the tiles at least a bit more fun \ different, and adds a bit to the game.

However, despite a few flaws, I think the game is a lot of fun.  Most dungeon-crawl games require a DM (Dungeon Master of some sort).  Since my gaming group is limited, that means I usually end up as the DM, which means I have to fight against my friends \ wife.  I always wanted a game that I could play with them, on the same side, and now I can!

I usually like more complex games, and I do agree that D&D:CR is rather simple, but it's the simplicity that makes this game work.  I am usually limited on time, so I rarely get to play the large epic games, like Descent.  We can easily play a game, or two, in a couple of hours.

As the rule system is simple, the game is very easy to pick up, and teach to others.  Most of the time I don't even really have to teach the rules, just get right into the game, which is nice.  Each scenario is also unique, and fun, so there is always something new to try.  Once you tried everything, you can always design a new scenario.

I should also mention that the figures \ models look amazing.  Yes, they are unpainted (most games are anyway), but they still look great.  I am a big fan of nice looking games \ components, and this game does not disappoint.  Some artwork on the cards would have been nice, but I am happy with what we got; the system is very streamlined.

The game can also be challenging at times, and may seem like you are constantly getting beat down, but I think that makes the game more fun.  So far we haven't lost yet, but we came really really close each time.  This makes the game more exciting, as you are always on the edge.  You can also tweak the difficulty a bit, quite easily, simply by adding an extra healing surge token.

Some people say the game does not give the players enough tactical choice.  For instance, you will almost always get hit by a monster 1st, with no way to react.  While this may seem unfair, it makes the game work.  There are plenty of house rules out there to circumvent that, and I tried out my own system as well.

While the choices may not be as diverse \ broad as in some other games, you still have to make decisions that do affect the outcome.  Choosing the right powers, for the right characters, to create a synergy between the group is very important.  

Also, since most of the really powerful abilities can only be used once per game (for the most part), the players have to be really careful when to use them, and how.  This usually creates some good discussions amongst my gaming group, as I like to analyze my choices, and come up with the best one.

Lastly I will also mention that there are more D&D games planned for down the line, that should add more variety to the system.  D&D: Wrath of Ashardalon just came out, and from what I have heard it is an improvement over D&D:CR.  However, since the tiles, heroes, monsters, and other cards are different, I think people that like this system should pick up D&D:CR as well, as it will give you more choices \ variety to integrate into your games (I am also a fan of the undead theme).

Overall, I think this game is really fun, one of the very few games out there that can be played co-op without a need for a DM, and can also be played solo!  The theme is also nice, and the components are great.  I would recommend it to most dungeon crawl fans, and people with limited gaming time, and a small gaming group.

P.S 

I play with a few house rules.  With said house rules, I would rate the game close to a 9.0 for the fact that it is easy to teach and play.  You get a good dungeon crawling fix for less effort \ time than some other games in this category.

I recommend an initiative variant and extra rules for special tiles (for instance some type of item check for the laboratory, etc.).

Very close to the perfect Dungeon Crawl experience. The (few) rule omissions are not a problem, the wild luck swings due to the D20 sure are, IMHO.

I enjoyed Castle Ravenloft as a group game.  The fact that it's a cooperative game is a bonus when it comes to evaluate the differences with other games in that genre...aka Descent.

The bits are beautifully produce and the gameplay flows relatively fast for a monster game.  I liked the fact that each player had a turn and not evryone at once.  Not that it was a problem in my group, but this method can be a savior when someone tries to tell everybody what to do.

Overall a solid 7.5

RATING: 3
I haven't played DnD in a long time, but I really enjoyed games like Descent, Runebound, and Dungeon Quest.  I was looking for a lighter dungeon crawl that didn't take so much setup time, and based on the exceptionally high rating on BGG, I thought I'd pick up DnD: CR.
Upon reading through the rulebook, I was very confused about how certain aspects of the game work.  It seemed very light on describing things like creature attacks and movement, but alas, I dived into my first game with my girlfriend, who also has enjoyed similar games, but has never played DnD.
We both found this game horribly boring and uninspired.  The cards are all bland and don't make sense.  Every time I drew a treasure for a monster I was victorious over, it seemed more like a trap or penalty most the time.  Uggh!  
We were constantly in the rulebook, which is silly, since it's so short to begin with.  You'd think "why am I in here so much, there are hardly any rules?", but the reality is, so many things are very unclear and so simplistic that they barely make sense.
We finished out our game, but we were bored to death, and actively tried to kill ourself by spawing more monsters.  Honestly, this was more fun than drawin encounter cards and getting yet another trap you can't defend against.
In the end, the game beat us before the game ending tile came up.  
All this game made me want to do was play another game of Thunderstone, or dust off Runebound and play a game with some flare, or a decent combat system.
It really seems like WotC is trying to find an easily accesible game for DnD, but this surely cannot be it.  If you want a game with depth and dungeon crawling, get Descent, if you want something lighter, grab Runebound or possibly the new Dungeon Quest.  Much more interesting games that have flare and inspiration.  
Sorry DnD: CR....you're going on Ebay or into the discard pile.

Good:
-Setup is super quick.
-Nice minis.
-Easy combat resolution.
-Interesting dungeon placement system.
-Monster movement system if fairly interesting.

Bad:
-Abundance of punch out pieces that seem to have no use.  (Apparently they are used for other adventures?)
-Terribly boring cards.  Washed out monster cards with only a pic of the mini.  No color.  Treasure cards have no pictures or flare.  Also washed out and a single color.
-Heroes seems very lackluster and uninspired.  
-Hero abilities are very limited and boring.
-Drawing treasure seems like a 50/50 between being good or actually being a penalty.  Isn't an encounter where the penalty should lie?
-No effective way to restore life, other than possibly always have someone be a cleric and pass turns to restore health, and praying an encounter doesn't kill you first.
-Awful rulebook with errors in text and very limited examples.  There isn't a single example of how a monster moves from tile to tile to attack you.  FYI, most can just launch themselves at you from tiles away for considerable damage. Huh?
-Still confused as to what dungeon tiles I include in the stack.  No rulebook information on what happens if you can't lay a tile due to corridor issues.
-Component storage is really out of wack.  Seems like WoTC wants me to punch all the dungeon tile "back in" for easy storage?  

I'm really not sure how everyone thinks this is so great.  Maybe most play a lot of DnD, and they just want something simpler, but I'm not sure this is it.  Follow my above reccomendations if you want a better dungeon crawl experience.

Thanks!

Putting the words "Dungeons and Dragons" in the title means an automatic demerit from me, because D&D is absolutely the worst roleplaying game I've ever played.

Game play of Ravenloft (and by extension, I assume, the others in the series) is pretty boring, to be honest, though not exactly terrible. It's got the usual random monster assortment, simple rules and dungeoncrawlyness you'd expect. But it's just a bit blah, and despite the opportunities for cooperative play, there's not much of a narrative. It's more of a an "Oh, look, two more monsters materialized out of thin air, let's chop them into little pieces" sort of thing. I'm actually okay with that. I mean, the whole idea that all these monsters live within inches of each other 24 hours a day and don't eat, poop, move or even fight each other is a standard fantasy trope. But you better handle that in an interesting, or at least fun way, or I'm just going to point and laugh.

Claustrophobia is much better, is thematically stronger and takes less time. There's nothing to Ravenloft that would ever make me play it instead.

decent value for what you get as Hasborg.  scenarios seem to offer a bit of variety, but I have only played the introductory scenario.  feels like a 2 or 3 player game as downtime might be an issue with more players (which feels a bit odd for a 1hr duration game?).  

gameplay works, but at times can feel really abstract and there is likely some potential gamey-ness in how the monsters operate (most co-op/solos done in this fashion can be gamed a bit, but i think the potential is more here due to the way the system has been simplified, abstracted and maybe even dumbed down).  

hopefully, hasborg will allow for some user created content as that could really help the game shine down the road.

one question i keep asking myself, would i rather just play a quick 4E d&d scenario/module, or this ?

This one suffered from expectations when it was released. Far more of a puzzle than a dungeon crawl, the pleasure in this one (besides the excellent production values) is in learning how to game the AI.

It fills a niche for an older D&D gamer like myself. I've been dying to play D&D again, but being a DM seems silly at my age unless playing with kids and nobody wants to be the bad guy against everybody else. A great fast paced game full of strategy. Lots of important decisions on every turn. Where you end your movement, how to deal with monsters, traps, villains and encounters and not wanting that 4hp elf in your party to explore is just part of the fun. 
It is a team game, you really have to work as a party and there is so much going on in each players area, it is impossible for anybody to take somebody else's turn. Generally you know what needs to be done on your turn anyway (some good ol' monster killin.)
 My fav part of this game is EASILY being able to run a campaign, come up with your own story with actual plot, character dialogue and such without having to change a thing about the game.

This is a coop game w/o DM.  Each player takes some of the load by playing monsters according to their rules and you all press on together.

The board grows randomly and each new tile has a monster.

This is one that will appeal to those of us that have grown up playing D&D - obvious really! The mechanics work really well and for a dungeon crawl it is truly great! The scenario book gives what appears a easy starting adventures, but by scenario 3 the forces of evil aren't quite such a push-over.
The game is very much fight after fight with minimal scene setting, which is the biggest difference from playing D&D with a human DM. But if that doesn't bother you then here is a really tremendous co-operative game, which I think provides an opportunity for many expansions (even home written ones)!
What more could you ask of a game that plays in an hour!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

While I want to love it, Castle Ravenloft has a problem with pacing. You're punished for not rushing into the dungeon, opening all the doors and alerting all the denizens ASAP, there are deadly traps everywhere and it is isn't, thematically speaking, the weekly bad thing in Pandemic or Shadows over Camelot. No, it feels like stepping in the poop every other second.

Aside from that, the core mechanic, "interpreting and manipulating the AI of the monsters so they position themselves at the optimal spot for your group to deal with them", doesn't feel satisfying and a bit too "meta" for a game that has the pretention of being an immersive dungeon crawler with great minis and thick cardboard.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Really liked this at first, but it started to get very repetitive after a few plays.  The movement system is a bit fiddly.  Hero movement and adjacency is by squares and monster movement and adjacency is by tile.  This leads to some oddness where the hero can melee a monster that can't melee back.  I feel like they should just have simplified it all the way and had heroes move and count adjacency by tile as well.  I also would have preferred less events and more monsters.  Fighting monsters is more interesting than resolving a random event card.  Also, there are only five different characters and they don't really have a unique feel.

The mechanics seemed clunky, goals and strategies were unclear, and just wasn't that fun. More than that, I had other games that were more fun and took less time. I don't even know if this game actually took that long even. That's just it, it was completely forgettable. I only remember being confused about it. I'm marking it right in the middle because it could be me not knowing what I was doing then, or it could just be that bad. I'll have to pull it out again to know for sure.

Not so keen on the spawn on a tile on every player turn
but these are step in quick co-op games where the team play and archetype choices can feel good even if the gameplay is a compromise. Hanging onto the 3 games to be able to improvise adventures with different parts of each.
 Never was much of a d20 fan for some reason.
Much prefer the other polyhedrals. I'm not really mad on what D&D has become. It can be really looking out for the other members of the party in this case which is quite a nice thing.

These D&D board games aren't super challenging but it gives me a dungeon crawl feel without forcing someone to DM. It feels like a very basic video game.

RATING: 7
In this cooperative dungeon crawl game set in the D&D universe, players choose between a cleric, ranger, fighter, wizard or rogue. On a player's turn they move/attack and explore new dungeon tiles, which turn up monsters. Combat is resolved in the D&D way, rolling a 20 sided die and resolving against armor class. 

The games are fun, full of tension, and engaging. Looking forward to going through all the 13 adventures.

Rating after one play only (Adventure 2). But a real disappointment. I'm not keen to play again but I have to, if only because the game was so expensive!  Hopefully a second play will iron out some of my issues... we'll see...

Nope. No change. Still not fun. This is just glorified roll-and-move.

Played by the rules, this is a brutal, unforgiving dungeon crawl that demands a careful, disciplined exploration to keep everyone alive, while also urging risk-taking to reduce the number of encounters.
Because the rules feel like they've been turned up to 11, it's very easy to tone down the difficulty when playing with younger kids or non-gamers.  Toned down, the game is brilliant for having such a range of monster miniatures to aid immersion, and serve as a gateway into the world of D&D.

Has been played three times, purchased new. All the different card and token types have been sorted and organized into different baggies. The box itself is in perfect shape. The main dragon boss, a gargoyle, and a skeleton warrior have been primed with Games Workshop's black spray primer, and one skeleton miniature has been painted above table top standard. (I'm a mini painter, i couldn't help myself). Every other mini has been left untouched.

Nice Dungeon Crawler. Very simple and can be played under 1 hour.
Only played it solo, so my rating can change when I play it with more players.

30/01/2012: Lowered my rating from 8 to 7, because I'm disappointed with the "lightness" of the game... Wish there was more theme injected and more relevant decisions involved. Also played it with my wife, which hated the game, and she said "it felt like the gameplay is only rolling a die".

06/02/2012: Lowered my rating to a 6. From now on I'll only play it with this variant: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/679173/castle-ravenloft-reversion-part-boardgame-part-4

BRILLIANT!!! This game fixes all of my issues with Descent. This is TRULY a pen and paper RPG dungeon crawl brought to the game table. Removing the need for a dungeon master means there is no antagonism and no need for someone to be apart from the action and dynamics of the group.

Also, the game is unbelievably fast to play while still presenting an honest tactical challenge.

Give me more and I will buy them!


------------------
Update:

Okay, so we've almost played through the entire book and my initial optimism is actually a little dampened.

The game is probably a bit too easy and routine, once you've cracked the system.

When it's hard, it's hard due to random chance compounding problem with problem (like some of the extreme outcomes in Arkham).

This is still a great game, and it's fun to play. But you will not always get a consistently CHALLENGING experience when you play it.

RATING: 9
Easy to play for those that have played D&D before, and condensed rules for those who have not.  Pre-generated characters and scenarios make it and easy alternative to traditional D&D if your group can't commit to the full thing, but still want the D&D experience.  Uses condensed 4e rules if that's a deal breaker for your group.

Cooperative dungeon crawling with fantastic components, even if the tiles are a little bland. There's pretty much nothing I don't like about this game, even if it does feel like the monsters are getting the jump on you (it's their dungeon after all). It's also pretty difficult, especially with two. Add to the expansions, and you've got a huge amount of game content.

Was an OK game that allowed you to cleverly use a few of your heroes' abilities, but ultimately you are pulling tile after tile, killing monster after monster, over and over.

Would play again though, I do love this genre of games.

I don't think it's a replacement, but it's something a bit heavier for those that want a light RPG game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.7
Light cooperative dungeon delver, with very simple rules and and a really easy to manage AI that provides for some challenging situations. 

The components are top notch: cool miniatures, thick cardboard, nice insert...

It includes an adventure book that contains a dozen adventures. They provide very light background and very few sepecific rules, not really different than anything you can improvise. The best news about this book is that it also provides different game modes, competitive play, team competition, solo adventures, etc. 

The characters are different enough to provide different gaming experiences and to allow for some tactics.

Replayability is not huge. You can easily improvise more adventures, but the feeling is pretty much the same for everyone of them (except the different game modes). You can add components from other D&D games (Legacy of Drizzt, Wrath of Ashardlon) to add some variation.

This is a light and much shorter Descent, for those who want a more fluid game.

This game seemed a little simplistic from the description and the rules that I've read, plus I've gotten into slightly heavier dungeon crawls like Gears of War so I wasn't sure that I'd like it all that much. But wow, it was actually a ton of fun despite its simplicity. It's tough but not overly so, and as long as you pay attention to the AI cards, when they'll activate and what they'll do, you can manage them fairly well. 

The encounters seemed like the toughest part as the random screwage can really mess up your plan. We pulled off a victory with literally one turn to spare on our first play. I think as long as you come in expecting something light and you're able to use a bit of imagination as in regular D&D, this can be a very good experience.

This D&D boardgame series (Ravenloft, Ashardalon, Drizzt) fills a hole for when you want an RPG or dungeon crawl but no one wants to DM or you don't have any encounters drawn up. 

The set up can be a bit time consuming, but it isn't terrible once you've done it a few times.

Update 15 Apr 2017

Played Adventure 2 and 6 with my 6 year old. 2 was a walk in the park but we failed at 6. Spent 4 healing surges but give up after 2 of us were dead at the same time. Failed 6 most probably because I was using the Wizard to pair up with the Fighter instead of the Cleric as in Adventure 2.

Didn't care much for the story, didn't care much for my character. Everything felt very mechanical. Realized that for a story-driven game as this, having a campaign is so important for feeling engaged. Although Adventure 6 was more interesting as we got to battle a dragon, the build up to it felt very samey. Open a tile, get new monster, kill monster, get treasure, repeat. Oh and the encounters are real bummers. I guess that's the game's way of making it difficult. 

110417
Played first adventure with Rogue. Didn't like the dull tokens, tiles and cards. Minis were nice though. Mechanically very simple. Draw monster, monster attacks, kill monster, open next tile, repeat. Decisions come in only in deciding whether to use daily and utiity powers. Didn't get a chance to level up hero as it's entirely dependent on luck. I hope that the next adventure with more characters will be more fun. Will compare this directly with Descent 2.0 solo before deciding whether to keep this. Might be a good intro to dungeon crawling with my 6 year old.

*洗勻怪物卡/遭遇卡/寶藏卡，選一個劇本，根據劇本設置，放置起始版塊跟兩個重生幣，根據劇本設置板塊堆
*每個玩家選一個一級英雄，拿英雄卡力量卡跟模型，放置在起始版塊內相鄰樓梯旁的空格，力量卡根據英雄卡上指示挑對應張數(劇本有建議選擇)，每個玩家再抽一張寶藏卡直到抽到物品為止，隨機起始
*遊戲照順位輪流進行，每個玩家回合有三個階段
1.英雄階段  如果此時沒血則棄掉一個重生幣，血量回到你的重生值(最左邊)，之後可進行兩個行動，行動包括移動跟攻擊但是攻擊只能一次
>移動  移動時可對腳移動，根據腳色的移動能力移動對應格，不能穿牆或穿對角的牆，可經過其他英雄但不能停同格
*特殊狀態會影響移動能力，但一種只能存在一個
>攻擊 選一張力量卡或寶藏卡使用之，每日力量卡使用後翻面，正常力量卡不用翻面，裝備力量卡使用後翻面(多數不需要攻擊行動可使用)，根據卡牌指示距離，選適合目標，丟一顆骰，骰值加上卡上攻擊加乘如果大過對方的AC值就成功，造成傷害數值的血量減少，低於0死亡否則用血量標記紀錄之，如果多個玩家有該怪的卡，則順時鐘靠近擊敗他玩家的玩家棄掉該張到共同的經驗堆，擊敗怪的玩家抽一張寶藏卡(不管幾隻)
*被打掛的英雄放倒，不在成為怪物目標，所有狀態棄掉，
*算板塊距離時不能對角(起始版塊算兩塊)
*拾取物品只要相鄰不需行動，消滅物品結算同攻擊，解除陷阱也花一個行動，丟骰骰值超過目標就成功
*逃離的英雄只會結算自己的宿敵階段
*從物品卡得到的攻擊或防禦加乘只能一次，抽到物品卡時要馬上決定給誰
2.探索階段 如果模型停在板塊邊緣則抽一張板塊，箭頭指向你所在板塊後拼放，之後抽一張怪物卡放到自己英雄旁照順序(如果已經有一樣名字的棄掉重抽)，然後把怪物模型放在圖版的骷顱格
3.宿敵階段 如果此回合沒有開版塊或是抽到黑色箭頭板塊，抽一張遭遇卡，如果宿敵在場上，啟動之，之後照先後順序結算你的英雄卡旁怪物卡或陷阱卡，如果其他玩家有一樣名字的怪物卡則同時結算
*遭遇卡 環境卡最多只有一張會作用，新的取代舊的，事件卡就結算，災難卡同怪物卡一樣放在英雄卡旁，宿敵階段結算，陷阱也一樣
*當抽遭遇卡時可支付五點經驗來跳過該卡效果，如果在攻擊或解陷阱時丟骰丟到20，則可以花5點經驗把英雄翻面升級並獲得新的力量卡

A pleasant enough co-operative ride game. It's your standard explore, put out new tiles, kill the monster, repeat until you satisfy the scenario condition type game. You start off by getting to choose your attack methods for your character which provides some inter-game variety. A turn is to move then attack or vice versa, with a new tile revealed afterwards if you're on the edge of the known world, complete with the inevitable new monster that gets a free whack at you. Attacks are adding a single die roll to your chosen attack method and seeing if it's >= the target's hit points, so they're pleasingly quick. There's a bit of ongoing strategic discussion between the players on how best to approach the scenario, how to tackle the monsters currently out, how to manage hitpoints, etc. It's pretty straightforward, do this or do that, but it's generally enough to dissipate the downtime ennui between turns. The decisions each turn aren't much - attack then move, move then attack, which attack method. But at least turns don't get bogged down with special powers or overburdened by modifier calculations, allowing the game to move along nicely and complete in the designated hour or so. The monster process is neat, that they only activate (move and attack as per the rules on its card) on the turn of the player that discovered it, giving the players a full round to deal with it - unless multiples of the same type come out and then they'll all activate each time one activates which can cause some stress. This process, and the encounter cards that regularly come out, create a sense of peril to be overcome, engaging the players. There's not a lot of deepthink, it's certainly played for the ride, but at the end of it, you have the satisfaction of a party collectively completing its mission or a determination to get it done right next time. As such, the game's succeeded in its own mission and I’d happily play again.

Yup! It's a tight co-op explore and combat board game system set in a D&D universe. Fun and plays in less than 90 minutes, not counting setup. This does well what the game system sets out to do. Basic characters, monsters, and traps. Many scenarios. Wonderful (unpainted) miniatures. Easy to teach. Also plays some solitaire scenarios. Lots of luck involved. I find the scenarios tough to beat.

I cannot say if it satisfies anyone's "dungeon crawl" cravings (which is a very subjective issue), but I have a blast playing this board game.

RATING: 5
"Strips out the best parts of D&D (exploration and story). Beautiful minis and nice dungeon tiles. It ends up being a brutal, random slog. At least it's short."

What I like:
- Quick pure co-op dungeon crawl, with great components
- Lots of scenarios in the box
- Combat system is nicely streamlined

What I don't like:
- Feels VERY oppressive, with monster and/or encounter every single turn
- High randomness with which monsters and events show up (plus dice, of course)

I had played Ashardalon once, with (I think) 5 people, and it felt like a brutal slog. Solo Ravenloft felt that way too. The math just doesn't work for me. Every turn, you're likely to get a monster (who hits you before you can fight back, often for 2 or 3 points), and half the time you'll get an encounter (which is likely to hit you). So you have maybe 10 turns before you're dead, but the fastest you can win is 11 turns. 

I think the BGG-voted 2.5 weight is about right.

I'm not sure how much this really captures the D&D (4th ed?) experience, since, at least in our plays the plan is to keep drawing monsters and avoid Encounters; thus the game becomes more a case of rushing thru a dungeon, reather than cautious advances etc. However it all works and it's fun.
The game is a lot of fun, scales well across a number of players and has been a hit for all. I do have a question as to it's long term appeal, since the monsters etc become a bit familiar (which, given the rushed nature of the game, means they can become quite abbreviated when they're revealed). Having said that, there is a goodly number of adventures presented in the book and of couree, all the piece are top notch

RATING: 8.75
I have mixed feelings about this game.  It seems very heavily anti-hero, but you REALLY feel like something has been achieved when winning due to the fact almost every rule is weighed against you.  The miniatures are incredibly well done, of course it would be nice if they were pre-painted, but can't get it all :p

Not to thrilled about activating multiple monsters of the same type every villian phase, but again when one manages to overcome this obstacle it feels like a real victory.

I enjoy the fact that the games in this line are combinable, creating a huge pool of heroes and monsters to play with.  Add in the monsters from Dungeon Command and the variety is astounding.

The rewards seem incredibly weak compared to the risk, but in all this creates a very tense game that is incredibly fun to play until losing in the 6th turn because of just plain bad luck drawing!

Giving it an 8 for the great D&D feel and component quality and sheer variety and replayability.  Fun game to play alone or with gamers who have some sense of strategy and teamwork.

This is a pretty good co-op.  I like the different characters to choose from, their different abilities, the ability to level up, and the varied monsters and different villain challenges throughout the level.  This is probably one of the better dungeon crawlers out there.

I don't like how all of the encounters are bad for the players.  I thought adventures should have *some* upside.  Also a few times the dungeon and monsters seem to get repetitive without much progression until the final boss battle.

I can perfectly understand that some people would be disappointed over this game, but in my view it delivers what it promises. A quick co-op hack'n'slash influenced by D&D. Looking forward to seeing the inevitable campaign expansion.

RATING: 3
This game was disappointing to me. The person I played with seemed to like it though. 

I found the choices to be too limited. The playing board is almost meaningless. I wonder if this game could work better as a card game. The play feels masochistic as you are always losing health with no way to really avoid damage each turn. Your health serves as a timer and this game mechanic ends up feeling demoralizing. Basically you must complete the end game before your health runs out. Another thing that bothered me was that your special power cards for the most part felt underpowered and are once per game use. Combat is also very random and swingy.

I did like that the game played fast. I really liked the miniatures. I also liked the concept of the game. Unfortunately it felt half baked.

I would say this game is worth getting if you want to use the figures and boards in a D&D 4th edition campaign.

Definitely a lighter, quicker dungeon crawler than Descent, although some of the rules feel unfinished, as though the designers are saying 'eh, whatever you think is best'. I'm currently starting the painting of all the minis in mine.

An overrated dungeon crawler. Combat is too luck-based, simple and shallow with just one d20 rolling. Hero skills are interesting but boil down to dealing 1 or 2 damage with different to-hit chance. Game also has lackluster hero progression and loot system.

I love the system. Very easy to teach and suspenseful. The monsters just keep coming! The treasures are a bit week but this has been fixed by Wrath of Ashardalon. It's nice to have both :)

RATING: 10
I think this is everything I wanted in a dungeon crawl.  You get to level up (maybe), you fight lots of monsters co-operatively, you have special powers and gain special treasures.  The tile-revealing aspect means that the replayability is high.  And it's based on such a solid system, I can easily see building great D&D Board Game/Descent/D&D RPG hybrids.  

Since WotC started doing Heroscape for a while, we have lots of pre-painted proxies for most of the heroes and monsters too.  I also think that it should be easy to add custom monsters and heroes.

RATING: 6
Robust D&D 4th ed. combat system mixed into a quick one-hour dungeon crawl. The feel, combat, coolness is there, but the roleplaying, theme and consequences are non-existent. I wanted a Descent Lite, but instead this is a D&D combat simulator. With user-generated quests (and a tweaking of some rules) this could be a good game. Until then, it feels like Gauntlet the board game, which is not always a bad thing, but a bit short of what I want. It just misses the potential. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I really like this fully cooperative game. The mechanics are very simple, but the variety brought by the tile placement and the randomness of the monster and event deck make this a different game every time. The missions are varied enough, and even if you limit yourself to what comes in the base mission book, it would pay for itself. This is the game I would recommend for someone who likes the D&D theme but does not like paper and pencil roll playing games. I works well from 1 through 5 players, though I think 4 is the best size (2 players with 2 characters each also works really well). The characters support each other well, and you should play to that. Fun, light and with great components. The only people I think would not go for this game are heavy Descent players. Too light for that type of mentality.

I would probably describe this as a potentially great game
with a number of flaws. No game is perfect, but this game
gets so much right and holds such promise that it's very
disapointing to stop short of real excellence. There
are tons of threads on these issues, so I'll just sum up
a few as I see them: 
1. Thematic elements are vastly underused. A short paragraph at the start of an adventure, no closing info.
Encounters are only a couple sentences and typically just
a quick shot to take HP.
2. The Game system is streamlined to a point it feels very mechanical at times. Not enough choice or variation 
during turns.
3. The Leveling system is very weak and limited.

Some of these issues come from player's expectations. If
you know what this game is about, and it still sounds
good, by all means get it. For what it is, it can be a
very enjoyable dungeon romp. Despite nitpicking, it still
has a very high average rating, because ultimately
players can see a great game is in there somewhere.

RATING: 7
Rated after about 6 games. This is a really fun hack and slash, fantasy-oriented game that is becoming quite addictive for me. Wickedly difficult at first, once you get a grip on the flow of play it feels more balanced. That's not to say there aren't wide swings of luck -- there is a D20 involved after all -- but good play will help the luck along and allow more wins. Note that all plays have been solo, which is just fine with me for now.

I'll revisit my rating after a few more plays to see whether it holds up or even raises in estimation.

RATING: 8
An excellent game for those who loved Hero Quest as kids. The enemy AI system means everyone can play, no GM is needed. Also lends itself to solo play.
I have Ravenloft fullt painted and Wrath of Ashardalon unpainted. I've not tried Legend of Drizzt.
Very popular with my school games group, but a little limited as it's only capable of five player games - we often have 8-12 people wanting to play.

Don't let my number of plays fool ya, I started recording my plays after we had gone through almost all of the scenarios.  

My second favorite in the D&D Adventure Game Series - It is also the hardest as some of the scenarios took many times to defeat.  

An enjoyable monster mix instead with the undead.  Spice up your game by getting the Dungeon Command Undead set and adding in the monsters - makes a good game even better

This game was - surprisingly - a major disappointment: poor design, cold, simplicistic, with mechanics lacking realism to consider it a dungeoncrawl. Completely uninspired, flavorless... An insult to the Ravenloft world, in my opinion.
Furthermore the rules booklet is not clear and a lot of questions arise during play; ok, some of them may be solved with logic, but many need an official FAQ.
Also components are poor.. few colors, no artwork on cards. Bah. Miniatures are clearly well done, but they are recycled D&D Miniatures after all (and unpainted...!)

A real pity because the game could have had some very good potential being a full cooperative (without a 'Master') with interesting and different scenarios, but as it is it was a waste of money.
One of the worst games I played in the last years.

It's just not something I want to play very often. The turn to turn decisions are not tense or that interesting, it usually is plainly obvious what players should do. Treasures and traps and encounters cannot really be planned around, so a lot of the game seems to just be to experience what happens to you, and I just don't find it to be that enjoyable.

Played this game for the first times(s) today and fairly enjoyed it. However, the game is a bit too simple for me and the theme (I loathe the "world" of Dungeons & Dragons) is too generic. The game features your usual random mix of supersimplified post-Tolkien wash outs, ranger,cleric, fighter, skeletons, ghoul etc., nothing new but old ideas recycled into something worse. The game itself is rather repetitive and I am not sure whether this will change with later scenarios (played the 1st and 6th). Furthermore, it looks like WOTC supplied the minimum amount of monsters, scenarios and heroes only to make this heavily expendable and cash in. If you compare the amount of bits and bobs in this game with the similar Descent or Arkham Horror, it looks pathetic. All in all, a nice dungeon romp and probably and nice fantasy-gateway game but unless I get in in a trade, I cannot see myself purchasing it at any point in the future.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
doesn't ring true. WTC already has an RPG that very easily runs as a pure boardgame- quicker than alot of the current Dungeon hack boardgames too. They also already have a dumbed down miniature game why would you dumb it down even further to the point it's painful? 

What's with monsters always attacking first?

What's with the butchered character abilities? Example: Ranger: Precise Attack- goes from a +4 attack in the RPG to an auto hit in this boardgame. That's not precise, that's heat seeking.

No campaign mode with a character that improves...really?

Had the opportunity to play before I bought it and felt good about purchasing it. I still feel that way to this day, but not at the price I paid for it.

At $65, I was expecting a much deeper experience from this game. Uninteresting map tiles without purpose (except on specific encounters), treasure cards with varying degrees of usefulness and big blank areas where artwork should be, and fairly predictable gameplay were the big things that shot down my excitement for the game.

The one thing I must give it credit for is that it can be a somewhat satisfying dungeon crawl experience in only an hour of gameplay. For this reason, I do not mind pulling it out for certain groups of friends and can actually have a good amount of fun playing it with them.

Maybe the simplicity of the rules and pushing around miniatures is fun, but I am always up for another dungeon delve. Love to play solitaire and paint its minis. If I have one quibble, the combat should be a little more refined (more chrome) maybe as optional rules.

RATING: 5
This game had a lot of potential but in my opinion, it failed to deliver... there is no immersion, rules are somewhat boggy, and the game gets repetitive real quick! Move, attack, attach a new tile, spawn a monster, make it attack... second player come and attack it, attach a new tile, spawn a monster, etc, etc until you get to the tile of the mission and complete it... I'll play it if someone wants to try it, but I will never propose it... I'll have more fun with Arkham Horror if I want to play coop, Earth Reborn or Mutant Chronicles for miniature/dungeon crawling game...

And since Ravenloft was one of the greatest adventures out there for D&D, and I loved the campaign setting, I have to get this. To bad that it is a WotC release as I hate them to get my money

Well finally played this game last night with a group of 4. Not to bad but really deadly. We ended up winning the adventure but would have all died if we had to kill all of the monsters on the board. I do think that it is better with a larger group then small. 4 or 5 would be the best.

EDIT:  damn..played my first two games incorrectly.   However, much of below still applies.  I forgot to take a treasure card after beat a monster.  This makes a huge difference with balance.  However, it still is random and it appears that the characters are not balanced.  The fighter is much better than any other character.  Still not very good especially for this age in board gaming.  

Played only the first adventure solo.  YUCK! This was pretty bad:first you are always attacked by a monster when it appears.  There are no roll modifiers to speak of or decision of great importance.  You don't gather anything that really helps and experience points have very little to do with character development. "really to get to level two, the top level, I have to just roll a 20 at sometime when I have 5 experience"  that is just ridiculous.  So you can be the top level on the third turn or never.    Either run away far enough from the monster to stall or attack and be injured by a new monster attack of even worse a trap either way you constantly bombarded with bad encounters.  There is just nothing up lifting in the game.  Just a pure dice roll beat down.  This makes heroquest look like a strategy game.  I'll give it another try  but this is looking like a plot for Wizards of the Coast to use those defunct D&D miniatures molds.  Played a second time now and confirms everything above.  Just not fun.  It has a kids game rules with kids game luck but there is nothing other than the cool miniatures to make a kid like this as a matter of fact I would think it might make them cry.  Awful!

A fairly simple cooperative game based (very loosely) on the Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game. This is actually a lot better than it ought to be, playing fairly fast, without much complexity or downtime.

Fast and light dungeon crawl. Works really well with kids or adults who like the theme and don't mind the lack of depth. Slightly repetitive sometimes,but still provides a fun packed 45-60 minutes .

Similar to D&D Wrath of Ashardalon, it's an excellent way to get both your D&D fix and your Dungeon Crawler fix with a well produced, quick, combatcentric game.

However neither of these games will satisfy that urge to play something better and more indepth wellrounded like Warhammer Quest, nor does it seem to capture the excellent nostalgia of HeroQuest and Advanced Heroquest......But it's an affordable alternative for those unlucky enough to own those grandaddy games.

Quite nice ligth Dungeon Crawler, Is highly customizable by the user(new house rules are very easy to add, or creating adventures). Better when player with a lot of players (more monsters, more treausure, more events :-)).

A light game, quite popular for the Saturday dinners :-) (just dungeon hacking, like in the old times, all straight foward).

I got the game because of the miniatures, for the price they are great (very god detail) the only cons is the soft plastic (with a good base coat the paint holds perfectly)...

Would considerd to buy Wrath of Ashardalon(the events look nicer and the doors should have been implemented in this game!...)

So after many plays, I still rate this game of 9.5. While it's very simple and does have some flaws, I do find it fun.... and that's why I play games.

Having being the DM or GM in any role playing or dungeon crawl game, it's nice to actually play the game with my fellow cohorts. The modular game system will be expanded on in the future and I see me playing this game for some time.

Dropped my ratings only slight after several plays with several groups. The came can get monotonous, but the different types of adventures keep it fresh.

Decent board game rendering of a D&D game.  Reminds me of Hero Quest (but I liked Hero Quest Better), good minis and scenarios but as a role player I would rather just play the "real thing" as this lacks the depth and substance I expect from role playing.  My 4 year old niece likes to play (it is her gateway to D&D which her parents play and she really wants to be a part of).

Love this game! My first RPG board game I've ever played. I game with my wife mainly and I'm not geeky enough to be a part of any "gaming" group - I guess?  That, or people just dont like me... Lol.

Anyways, we have played it twice and have had a BLAST!  The rules were easy for us ultra novices to figure out, and while there is a lot of action, things never really were complicated.  BTW, we won the first game, and got it handed to us in our second play through.

I mention the wife part because if she liked this game, which was WAY out of her comfort zone, chances are most people new to any type of RPG gaming would enjoy it.

Based on reading the rulebook: The rules start out quite strong but end with a fizzle. An overly distilled rule set leaves something to be desired.

[b]The good:[/b] Intermixing of enemy and player turns, concept behind enemy AI, removal of tedious "line of sight", variety of encounter and power card types, and no "door" mechanic (removes choke point issues when grinding monsters)

[b]The bad:[/b] The artwork of all components are uninspiring, character system is totally void of depth, basic health system: three tries and game over, difficulty not based on player count, and no campaign system.

Solo Player Value = Good.

Castle Ravenloft is a fun cooperative dungeon crawl game that scales fantastically from a solo player to five players.

Castle Ravenloft carries the Dungeons & Dragons license and uses the general flavor, terms, items, monsters, etc., of Dungeons & Dragons. But this is a different version of Dungeons & Dragons then what many might be accustomed too.

The Dungeons & Dragons system used in Castle Ravenloft has more in common with the card driven Pathfinder system then the tried and true 4th Edition D&D that many know well. That Pathfinder system is then further altered to adapt it to work in a board game. Although altered, the base D&D system is still intact. The base D20 system is present and easy to use. Triggered card abilities power the individual character abilities.

While some might be put-off by this modified D&D system, I think it works well for this game. The D&D system in Castle Ravenloft is easy to learn and manipulate making it very accessible to all levels of gamers.

Essentially Castle Ravenloft is a multi-player solitaire game. Each turn the player gets to perform his player action and them must act as the game against the players. This keeps the game clean and smooth and allows the game to scale well. The constant game actions keeps the game lively and tough on the players which I find challenging and fun.

The art work is nice as the figures are well done. The modular board is standard D&D fair.

The scenarios work very well and scale upward in difficulty.  This offers the players an easy continuing campaign adventure through all the scenarios.


Pro - 
- Great use of the Dungeons & Dragons theme and license 
- Easy to learn and play
- Good dungeon crawl feeling

Cons -
- Modified D&D system might put-off some
- If you do not like dungeon crawl you will like this game

RATING: 6.7
--Sept2010-- Pretty cool dungeon crawler.  Much simpler than Descent; cleaner to play than Dungeonquest; much (much) more compelling than Tomb.  Of course, all of those (by my standards) are pretty bland praise:  Descent is fairly complex; Dungeonquest is strangely fiddly (well, at least the old version was; I've not yet played the new one); and Tomb isn't much fun at all.  This is one I'd be happy to play again - but I'm not convinced it's one I'd buy.  Still, it might be quite compelling for my 8 year old!

RATING: 9
A very fun game, but the treasure items were lacking. The monsters aren't as hard to kill as in WoA, and the encounters weren't as brutal as WoA either. I like to mix the two together to make a better balanced combo of treasure items, monsters, and encounters. Though, this does break the theme a bit between the two (Vampire, zombies, etc. vs orcs, dragon, etc.). I'm looking forward to combining with Legend of Drizzt.

Overall good, but the monsters seem a bit overly relentless to be as fun as it could be.

Trade Comment: Very lightly played. Still in very good condition. Up for trade as I'd rather focus on a few others be it Descent 2nd Edition, real D&D, Savage Worlds, Pathfinder, or a few others on my wishlist...

RATING: 6
Interesting games, but I prefer a few tweaks to make the game more fun: Allow players to level up for 10XP in addition to the d20+5XP rule, changed turn order (hero, villain, monster, explore, encounter) and removed the abusive encounters from the deck (attacks,some environments). Game is much more fun this way and allows range fighters to kite some as well as tanks the chance to get between the monsters and the other players. Still challenging to win.

RATING: 4
An excellent simplification of D&D. However, they removed some needed elements. The scenarios feel the same outside of a few mechanic changes. The gameplay while repetitive, was extremely solid.

For a thematic game, I felt like the story was really weak. Each scenario is only given 2 paragraphs of story that doesn't really feel to have an overall plot.

If you're looking for a story driven game, this isn't it. If you're looking for a good dungeon crawl this may scratch that itch.

I had high hopes for this D&D series but its really simple. I mean, far too simple.

Avoid this series if you actually like boardgames because this really is nothing other than a pretty box on the shelf.

Wow.  How pretty.  How broken.  There is a passable game in here somewhere, but it lurks beneath some poorly fleshed-out rules that barely explain the game well enough to play through.  Even the FAQ is frustrating.  Limp effort, but with some time and polishing of the rules and FAQ this may be worth some time.  It makes me hesitate to keep buying the series, though, but maybe as I have more time I'll read up on them a bit more.  I suspect there are a lot of fanboy ratings in here, as this average rating just seems ludicrous.

RATING: 4
Cool bits is right. I've summed up CR as a $20 game of $50 worth of bits. WoA is an improvement, as a $25 game of $50 worth of bits. Really, if you have no intention of using the figures in D&D games (D&D Miniatures, the upcoming D&D Skirmish game, and D&D itself), you shouldn't be buying this game.

IMO, CR feels like a game where everyone's screaming "GET TO THE CHOPPA!!!". If you want an RPG, play an RPG! D&D takes forever to play, especially now that combat is more boardgamey, but there are plenty of "light" RPG systems and storytelling games that *can* be played in an evening.

(Especially Call of Cthulhu, where you might not last long enough to even complete the introductory scenario!)

Very nice components, sturdy boards, nice miniatures and a plethora of cards & tokens. Good box insert to store it all. The core rules are easy, but a little ambiguous sometimes. It's a great co-op game to play with kids. Varied Adventures and random dungeon exploration give this great replay value.
It can be fiddly at times, because of the many tokens.

Castle Ravenloft is the most difficult of the D&D Adventure games, and it boasts the strongest setting of the three. I really love the bestiary especially. As to how it compares to the other two, it's probably the simplest one, which isn't good or bad. The three games are similar enough, and all have the same strengths: razor-sharp adventuring action and a wonderfully deconstructed look at what makes fantasy games great in the first place.

The rules are straightforward and for the most part not especially original. But, the rule that everyone ends his turn by playing the monsters for which he is responsible is genius. It spreads the gamemastering over all the players, and helps keep up the pace. Also I like the powers, it all just feels well thought out and streamlined. In my opinion the creators have very succesfully applied the less-is-more here. Also, I have much fun with this with my five-year old son, who loves the theme and playing with the half-dragon.

Epitomizes hack and slash, sans tactics or choices, the dull as dishwater way to play D&D. 

What gets me even more is all these bits and pieces of cardboard yet the thing is so limited compared to a few committed players, a couple of slender volumes, several funny-shaped dice, and the imagination. 

This is not D&D light; it's not an intro to D&D for young players. Try the real thing or Dungeon Twister or something, anything else. See other comments surrounding mine for more spot on assessments of this travesty.

The flaming skeleton makes me laugh every time I look at it as does the little pile of rat droppings or whatever that is.

RATING: 10
This is a players vs. the system cooperative game of dungeon crawling and combat. Players choose from 5 different characters each granting a unique ability to the group. Players will select a scenario to play through which will determine the starting position of the board and set out the victory conditions. The map is randomly determined by using a set of square tiles, ensuring that each tome the game is played the experience will be different. 

When monsters are revealed a card is drawn and a figure is placed on the board. The monster's card determines how they act when activated, by listing their tactics.  Players who found the monster "own" the monster and only activate them at the end of their turn, or if another player has an identical monster.  The players lose if anyone dies, and with only 2 healing surges available that is a likely outcome. The game is challenging but not insurmountable nor formulaic.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
 A modern classic - the monster AI was a ground-breaking innovation, much imitated. The game is fast, fun, and beautifully made. The minis are exceptional quality and value. Later iterations implemented a lot of good ideas, but certainly of the first three games I found this the most fun to play - possibly because it is tough, certainly I found the scenarios to be most interesting. The encounters are deadly, so the game can be very challenging to beat - but some combinations of characters are much stronger than others (include the wizard in your party if you want a challenge, and don't have the cleric in play - cleric+fighter is a pretty tough team). I play it more either solo or with kids than with other adults, but have really enjoyed all my plays so far.

This is a great game and is very well-designed.  It plays in an hour or so, which is a tremendous achievement for a dungeon crawler.  There is such a tendency by game designers to want to emphasize the leveling experience and detail so much that games can drag on forever.  That puts them out the reach of people with limited pay time, like me.  CR is a light tactical game but not so light that there are no meaningful choices.  You have to think and work together to do well.  I would contrast this with, say, Heroquest, which has almost no real choices at all.  I like each choice of powers each character has.  It adds variety that makes things interesting.  Making the powers of different characters work together is interesting too.  There is a lot of player interaction and teamwork as people talk about options.   Anyway, this game is a real achievement.

I didn't feel like the game was very immersive though. The dungeon tiles were too plain and I really didn't have any idea what the rest of my party was capaple of. I guess this will change with subsequent plays. Definitely worth playing though.

Well, I finally played it and to say that I was underwhelmed would be an understatement.  It's like Descent merged with intro D&D 4e.  The bits are all pretty cool, but considering all of the minis are sculpts from previous sets, you'd think they could have included the previous pre-painted minis.  It may have added to the cost a little, but it would have made a big visual difference, rather than looking at blue blobs for heroes and red and ivory blobs for monsters.

Talk about over-hyped.  The gameplay is meh, at best.  Every room has an encounter, the Cleric can BARELY heal anyone, the distinction between tile and space is weird, etc.  Everything pretty much does 1, 2, or 3 points of damage so its weird for anyone who has prior D&D experience.  Line of sight is irrelevant and there are just too many quirks about it that make it something that I have pretty much no interest to play again.  I almost gave it a 7 as our group had a decent enough time with it, but since it is a WotC product, it incurs an immediate 1 point penalty :-)

A tight little design with solid components.  Challenging, but also well-balanced.  I wish the tile design was more varied and brought more map-specific elements to the table.  For example:  being able to actually do something in the laboratory, or running into other adventurers, or even discovering treasure caches.  I *really* enjoy the co-op aspects.  I have played this half-a-dozen times with a close friend, and every time we've thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, often shouting out or laughing in utter amazement at how the dungeon keeps kicking our ass.  Fighting with a partner against a dungeon that doesn't quit is a great game night.

RATING: 6
This is not a bad game. It's a little repetitive, but I would say it's biggest flaw for me (and where I feel it breaks away from it's D&D theme) is a lack of experience carryover. Even though the scenarios are written as a campaign, each game you start over from scratch. Your character can only ever be a level one or a level two, and you start at level one again each time you play. You also don't keep to keep your equipment. Some of it just goes into a draw pile so you have an extremely small chance of drawing it the next game. Not a terrible game, but definitely doesn't live up to the D&D theme.

Works as advertised. 1 hour easy to pick up D&D adventure whre you go in the Dungeon and you hack and you slash and that is what you are doing. 

I realised that while an okay experience, I wasn't really crazy about it - theme is not strong as this is hack 'n' slash, no roleplay. Probably this is great for kids, but I found it too fluffy and not enough PVP to make it interesting (as in Muchkin). Okayish.

I got this game hoping for more than what it was, but that could be cause I'm a D&D player, although I did play this with the mindset that it wasn't like D&D at all. Still, I just can't put my finger on what bothers me about this one.

So far, played as a 3-character party. Would have done well to have everyone read the rules first, as there is a lot (by quantity, not complexity) to get through, but we managed fine. Some common questions should be better answered in the booklet (e.g. do coffins impede movement?). Pieces are of excellent quality and look like they'd stand up to heavy use; they and most of the minis would also be great for most D&D scenarios you could cook up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
The game doesn't seem like much at first: fairly procedural, not much variation in the cards, etc.

But damn, I can't get it out of my head. 

Everything comes together quite well. The gameplay is like a D&D miniatures ultralite combined with Betrayal at House on the Hill exploration and movement.

The pluses are that it's simple. It's doesn't really bog you down with FFG-style kazillion cards and 48 page rules. I guess that you swap simplicity for procedure.

But the theme and variation on the 'missions' makes up for this. Once the players gets a hang of the way the game works, it clicks. 

All scenarios seem to be well balanced and playtested. It's tough but not impossible. Plus the game has a really good system of self-governing and scales well. More players = more monsters and encounters. Each player taking charge of their own monsters and traps means that the game doesn't need a DM (everyone gets to play!).

The characters are quite varied and skills are interesting to see in effect. 

I just enjoy it for what it is. A light dungeon-romp that's over in an hour. 

Looking forward to the Wrath of Ashardon.

Funnily enough, the guy at the local store said Eurogamers hated the game because of the procedure and fixed sequence of play. D&Ders were buying the game for the bits to recreate their campaign!

WOTC: you've got a hit!

RATING: 7
I feel that Castle Ravenloft LOOKS a lot more complex than it actually is once it's all set up. It's a little annoying how the board expands because sometimes it tends to go off the table, then we have to migrate to the floor. The minis are really detailed, and I feel that you get a lot for the price. Some scenarios become frustrating because it's easy to lose for reasons that cannot be controlled, such as traps and monsters that can randomly spawn out of control. I find the game to be fun for a light dungeons and dragons game but it really depends on the scenario.

RATING: 7.5
Nice lite game with great miniatures in a theme I love. Lite enough to get the wife to play. The figures are super detailed and inspired me to take up painting them as a project. 

I don't own other dungeon-crawler boardgames, but I played D&D for a few years in my youth. This plays more like a more-developed Zombie Plague - and that's good. I have a tendency for analysis-paralysis, and this game hacks away at that. That is, for a game that lasts an hour tops, I don't get hung-up on whether this move or that move will wreck a 3- or 4-hour epic.

The game also lends itself well to variants and customization. I'm looking forward to trying out campaign and more-tactical variants, and developing character cards for minis from other games.

RATING: 7
The most difficult of all the D&D Adventure board games. That, plus the undead theme, make my favorite of the series. 

I thematically describe this as "Diablo" the boardgame.

Unfortunately, the game can get a little monotonous as the majority of turns consist of Move -> Roll Die -> Draw some cards. But I will keep it in my collection for the nice miniatures, the nostalgic theme, and the co-op gameplay.

Pros:
+ Plays in an hour
+ Customizable heroes
+ Cooperative gameplay
+ Little setup time
+ Scales perfectly with increasing number of players
+ Each game plays differently
+ Rules are easy to learn
+ Modularity of components makes it easy to create custom content


Cons:
- Encounters are always bad and cannot be prevented by exploring
- The dungeon tiles add nothing to the gameplay (e.g. like obstacles/ stairs/ secret passages...)
- Gameplay is sometimes predictable  (e.g. always place a new monster when exploring)
- Monsters always get to strike first
- Artwork is a bit bland, though functional

Overall I think this is a great game! Hoping to see Wrath of Ashardalon remove the last minor flaws.

I was expecting a great mix of boardgame and role-playing, with character development and plenty strategic depth. I was looking for a Warhammer Quest replacement. I was disapointed. This game isn't. The weird way players move squares, and monsters move tiles doesn't do it for me. And a lot of other things.

This is a distilled version of 4th edition D&D, which is ideal for the boardgame format.  Easy to see why it is getting such positive buzz.  I find that it gets a little bit repetitive with constant monster & event drawing.  Still an excellent co-operative dungeon crawler.

It does exactly what it should.  Quite a cool little dungeon crawl.  If you want complexity, buy Descent.  If you want a quick easy hack and slash, here it is!

RATING: 6
It's a nice D&D game and certainly helps scratch the D&D itch although obviously can't match the complexity of a pencil & paper campaign. A great way to introduce friends to D&D. The dreary castle setting tiles can get a bit dull after a while. The game can be quite challenging (difficult) at times and I feel there isn't a lot of options/opportunity for strategy.

A good co-op is when you think you've lost, but you pull out a victory through clever play. Or it's when you think he have it all planned out except for one contingency and then that event happens. This game is like that and it's very fun to work together and plan out moves.

This is what I would call an experience game.  It's not so much whether you win or lose as the fact that's it's quite fun to play and enjoy what happens.  That said, there are still fun decisions to make, even though a card might come up that makes you do something you don't want to do.  I love how the scenarios can be replayed as well, with no concerns of repeating anything.  It's a genius system, no doubt, and will certainly be expanded and enjoyed for many years to come.  *Update* - 10 plays in and I'm finding this system to be a bit uninspired.  I'm not sure whether it's the blandness of the graphic design or whether the mechanics don't feel fresh anymore, but something has definitely been lost here.

I'm not a fan of the modern D&D boardgames. I love me a good dungeon crawler, but this one forces players to game it hard to win. Any dungeon crawler that encourages the party to run to opposite corners of the dungeon to quickly win is no bueno.

RATING: 9.5
Fun all over the place, with the right group. 

There are definitely some gaps in the rules that one has to fill in, but that seems forgivable with a dungeon crawl such as this. Here are some things I like about it:

the BITS!! - please, someone paint my minis! 

the short play time

the fantastic scenario book - each adventure really feels different, uses different tokens and boss creatures, and some even throw in different mechanics, such as a day/night timer. 

The player-chosen powers that are unique to each character

The level of difficulty of the adventures - well designed and tense till the end (so far)

The dungeon tiles, which make the board different each play



Some stuff im not a fan of:

I don't like how simple combat is - I see why they did it this way, but ill have to home rule a better combat system, or research a good geek-made one.

the main mechanic of the game, wherebye one player attacks a creature, then can explore, then all the creatures s/he controlls attack,then the next player can attack, feels very disjointed to me. The combat is broken up in such a way that I dont really get the feeling that I and the rest of the characters are really fighting together at the same time. I would like it much more if all the characters could attack, one after the other, then all the creatures attack the characters. But, i know this is just a personal preference. 

There are far too many encounters, and they feel too abstract. I use the Barkams system (found in the variants section) to ameliorate this - works much better. Thanks Barkam!

For the first few plays I sort of enjoyed the experience, then a receptiveness crept in.  This turned out to be oh so boring.  There is very little strategy involved and terrible implementation of a system that promised so much. 

I shelved the game for a year and got it out to try again,   but only got half way through, and decided to sell this [b]shocker[/b].  This is a game with nice components and repetitive game play with little scope for adventure.  CR one big missed opportunity. Sold.

RATING: 7.5
Excellent game as it is... but when you customize it using bits and pieces from the other D&D boardgames, as well as with your own creativity, it really shines.  My own Frankensteined version I'd easily rate a 9.5.  Love it.  As a pure rating of the original Castle Ravenloft game, however, 7.5 seems fair.  Fun, good game, not great, but certainly worth some plays and recommended to people who enjoy fantasy themed games, especially co-ops and smash ups.

As a sandbox boardgame, I'll go with a 10 -- no other boardgame has inspired me to fiddle and create like this one has... in THAT respect, it really captures the D&D experience!

A relatively simple dungeon crawler that has some great minis and is easy to set up and get into.  
It does take up a fair amount of space and I keep wanting to be able to modify that single die roll somehow (generally you can't) but its a fun game despite that.
Unlike Mage Knight Dungeons its not particularly expandable, only the Dungeon Command figures really add anything. My wallet likes this aspect though.  
There are also plenty of custom scenarios and, like MKD, its easy enough to build your own.

It boils down to this: If you like D&D chances are high you will enjoy this, too, if you don't care for D&D this will hardly work for you. Very similar, essentially this game is role playing without a game master and extremely reduced story aspect, you give people cards instead of die rolls to set abilities and powers. And then you enter the dungeon but whereas in in regular D&D (and any other role player) you have a range of choices about the events, here monsters pop up constantly and you try to kill them while not dying so that maybe you can get to live long enough to reach the quest target.
A Co-op that is reasonably tough but highly repetitive. Heroes move only a space while monsters move a complete tile, another little aspect I didn't like.
So, I have tried to get into D&D but it just wasn't for me and neither is this game but if having to pick one I would take regular role playing over this, there is just more going on, this one is the boiled down version and therefor bland. If you think the look of these is great, check out the Dungeon Command series, those look even better and those I enjoy playing!

A fun dungeon-crawler which doesn't require a player to act as GM. Many of the rules come from 4e D&D, so it's best to play with people who already know that system. This is the first game in the series, so it's a little rougher around the edges. It's also by far the most difficult. I'd recommend getting Legend of Drizzt first.

Listen, if you design a Co-op game, it must be hard to win.  Otherwise I won’t be back.

RATING: 2
I was pretty excited prior to owning this game, however, after a couple of plays I am now selling it.

The game is dull, thematically it is good however this is far overshadowed by a poorly written manual with very ambiguous rules and dull gameplay.
The game relentlessly punishes the player(s) with damage dealing events at every turn. There is little or no chance to regain the number of Hit Points that are lost each round so it is a fight of attrition. Monsters move by tile, players have to move by squares so there isn't even a chance to escape. Monsters attack first, most encounters do damage of some form.
The game wants the party of players to remain bunched up and fight one monster at a time. Even when you do nothing for your turn, something nasty is likely to happen.
This game could have been great, but sadly misses the mark by a vampiric mile.

Very weak.  Played several games where it just felt like the die hated us.  I think after one person rolled a 1 or 2 on 6 attacks in a row, we just gave up.  There wasn't going to be much point to trying to finish that game since we were basically screwed with all the monsters on the board.

Goes far beyond bad luck, though.  The game is clearly stacked against the heroes with many attacks primed to hit most characters except for the fighter with a >50% chance, whereas the heroes' powers have maybe a 50% chance or slightly less to hit any monster that isn't a weak kobold.  It's much easier with more adventurers; I would almost go as far as to say that the game is likely unplayable with two characters because you will die too often.

The worst offender, however, is the combat system.  It seems innovative and unique.  The real problem lies in the mechanics of it.  Having played D&D 4.0 and thinking it has a rather elegant tactical combat grid mechanic, going to a system that parses out attacks orthogonally by tiles seems ridiculous.  I cannot fathom why a monster sitting on a tile diagonally across from me would simply move one tile toward me while a monster seven squares away on the edge of an adjacent tile would zoom all the way over and attack me with all its might.  This major disconnect makes the game feel very stupid and inelegant.  It sucks whatever little theme out that the game had and makes it a contest of trying to position the monsters as strategically as possible so that the game doesn't kill you off too quickly.  No, thanks.

This game not is a dungeon crawler or a tactical rpg system taked to a board game. This game is more like Ghost Stories or Pandemic, Castle Ravenloft really is a easy board game, full of tension and agonic decisions. Is a race against time, better played with 3, 4 or 5 players.

The archetype of guilty pleasure for me. I like dungeon crawlers and co-ops, so this was almost an automatic buy. The game is very entertaining, but full of rough edges and rule holes and best not taken too seriously. 

The two later installments are probably better, but with the frequency I'm going to play this (which is low, unfortunately), I probably won't be needing them in this lifetime. Playing all the scenarios will probably take a few years.

This is a great, rules light, dungeon romp!  I've enjoyed every play of this.  It plays great solo, and I've also had a blast with the two player games I've gotten in with Ren.

My only caveat is to be careful about the 'Impossible Mission' solo scenario.  If you pull the Werewolf and you're not extreemly lucky, it'll probably end in all the characters being devoured.  I plan to exclude that particular foe from my future plays of that scenario.

Played about half of the scenarios with 2-4p.  Ravenloft is a tactical miniatures game with an innovative GM-less exploration and combat system, but plentiful, harsh encounter cards that damage the heroes without any chance of evasion.

Great theme play.  Fairly easy to learn and play.  Game play was not all that fun.  Did not feel as though exploring a dungeon.  So much combat that characters cannot catch there breath - brain burner just to stay alive.  The items found are near useless too.  Very disappointed.  The components were good - modular board, (some slightly warped), plastic playing pieces, and somewhat durable cards.  Rulebook was unclear on many aspects.  Game length good at about an hour.

Sometimes I just want to run around a dungeon killing monsters and grabbing treasure and not think about strategy or even think at all.

I have only played a couple games solo and I was *hoping* it would be an interesting solo experience. But it seems pretty hard, the decisions aren't many, and the luck (per d20 die rolls) can be really frustrating when it's not going your way. I wish there didn't HAVE to be a new monster on EVERY friggin' tile. I'm not sure continuous pummeling on every turn is a fun experience.

I've still yet to find the solo board game experience that beats a videogame or a good book.

I can see this game improving with more players. At least there's someone there to share the misery.

I have played through the first single player game twice.  I had a lot of fun with it and I look forward to sharing it with my friends.  Once you get the mechanics rhythm down it becomes second nature and then you focus on enjoying the events as they unfold.

Bought on a whim to play with my 10 and 13 year old children. So glad I did it is perfect for week night gaming. We can get this to the table after dinner and feel like we killed the bad guy and secured the treasure all while working together in under an hour. Super fun when played with kids who love hack and slash. Would I play this with my main game group maybe once or twice just to show it to them, but other than that we would be very bored. It's a dungeon crawl monsters spawn you pick your best chance to hit attack on your turn and roll a die. Rinse and repeat, I feel the same way about Descent only thing is Ravenloft only takes an hour not 4 or 5. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I love being able to play completely through a dungeon crawl in about an hour, but this game has some problems.  As many others have pointed out, the game gets repetitive, because a monster spawns and gets first attack on every tile that is drawn, and encounter cards continuously whittle away at the heroes life with no change to avoid damage.  Also, treasures are dull and frequently useless, and leveling up takes a lucky natural D20 roll.  Some fan submitted rules re-writes have been reported to improve the game mechanics--I'll have to check them out, but it feels as though this game was not playtested enough to make it a great game out of the box.

Nice minis. Poorly written rules. After a few plays, I wrote this: I'm liking this. The monster 'AI' system leads to interesting situations and lets you outmaneuver as well as out-fight monsters. The different characters have interesting abilities. The events throw neat twists and loops into the game, and some are very clever and thematic, such as when a monster runs to get help.

After more plays, I'm fed up with it. Very repetitive. Events get annoying fast. The characters all blend together pretty quickly. Many of the scenarios are a mess.

Downsides: Rules are really, really confusing. Trap tiles are very bland with no art at all. I really dislike the "timers" based on drawing white tiles; a timer should encourage you to move fast, not go count down WHEN you go fast!

Very accessible tile-laying co-operative dungeon crawler. It's extremely well-produced with an absolute tonne of components, all produced to the highest quality. The game's strength is also its weakness though. It plays fast for a game of this type, which is definitely a good thing and prevents the combat (which is the main feature of the game) from becoming repetitive. This in turn means that you don't get much of an opportunity to develop your character (you can only level-up once and there's a dearth of different skills to customise your character with), which, if done well, is a feature that definitely enhances the appeal of RPG-themed games. Also, considering that there's so much included in the game, there doesn't feel as though there's an awful lot of variety to the characters (only five to choose from), monsters and playable adventures thus limiting the game's replayability somewhat. I do expect much of that to change with future expansions though, which this game seems to have a great deal of potential for.

After many play sessions I've increased my rating from 7.5 to 9. This game gets better and better with each play through because I realize just how flexible the adventure system games are. You can easily modify them by mixing and matching components from the other two games and from the new Dungeon Command sets. Castle Ravenloft remains my favorite of he three games mostly due to its theme, very flavorful scenarios, and extreme difficulty. Legend of Drizzt is far too easy, I prefer the brutal challenge of Castle Ravenloft.

Best dungeon crawl that I have ever played.  I have never played 4ed D&D so I cannot compare to the full RPG but this game is just fun.  The mechanics are simple and make you feel like your are exploring a dungeon.  As long as new scenarios, creatures, etc... keep coming out I believe I will continue to rate this game high.  If new content falls of I am sure my rating will also fall.

Well, it's better than Descent, though that wouldn't require a whole lot. It's still an frantic turbo run through an unthematic dungeon, but at least it isn't insanely hard and doesn't require a 4-5 hour investment. 

In truth, both are a poor strategic game (rules are too light and unnuanced), a crappy board game (too much downtime, not enought choices pulling in opposition directions) and an awful approximation of an RPG.

Feels like a more advanced version of DungeonQuest. I really like what Wizards have done with this game, you can actually tell a story around your adventurers and they will have a challenge reaching their goal every time.
Really nice scenarios and there are even some nice homemade scenarios available at BGG.

Completely stupid with huge amounts of randomness and very little in the way of tactical possibilities. Also, full of God-awful flavour text that really reads like it's written as a parody.

That said, it's almost fun because it's so fast. It's massively over-produced as well.

Update: The game often tends to end fairly closely, though I'm more convinced that is a result of balancing the difficulty than any choice the players make. It really does seem to play itself...

Rating down from 6.5 to 5.8.

29-Dec-2011: Got this 2nd hand from Frank who stated that the game was 'Shite!'. Played this at Billabongs with Trev, Peter, Phil, Chris and myself. The result was mixed reactions; Me, Trev and Peter liked it, Phil detested it.

Still, it was fun when the final turn saw Chris trying to chuck a Potion of Dragon's Breath to kill off a Wraith before he could run into the Chapel and pick up the Holy Symbol for the win. Of course, he fails to kill the Wraith, and the whole party lost as a result, but that was memorable!

I think this needs to be played with the proper group to have fun.

LOVE this game. a new favorite! play is fast, rules are easy to understand but the mechanics involve a LOT of tactical depth (if you're not communicating as a team well, you're doomed!). 

the only issue i have is that the miniatures supplied are cast very very poorly. this may not be common, but my figures have multiple places where the parts were not attached correctly, or the sculpts were done so poorly that it's difficult to tell what things are or where one bit of armor stops and skin might begin. (to be fair, i collect miniatures and previously painted them for a living, so my eye is perhaps more critical than most.)

The game is a lot of fun though, perfect for when someone in our regular D&D weekly game can't make it to a session and the group still wants to get a taste of D&D without having to play the missing player's character for them.

The evolution of cooperatives continues with Castle Ravenloft, an enjoyable dungeon crawl. Ravenloft avoids the pitfall of many similar games with simple rules and speedy play - there will be no complaints of fiddly here! The minis aren't the greatest, but that's a minor quibble. Overall, a fun and tense game that's being added to my "want" list.

RATING: 6
A not-so-good twist on the real D&D adventure.
I'd even say that Descent is a better D&D game that this.

However, with its relatively decent porting or rules, the game makes a nice starting point for teaching D&D. My group uses actual character sheets from 4.0e, we scale monsters based on our level and use the Castle Ravenloft spawn and encounter rules. 
With substantial modifications this game is playable and even fun.

RATING: 5
Castle Ravenloft is an oddly bland cooperative dungeon crawl.  Didn't D&D spawn the detailed lineage of this genre eons ago?  Yet Castle Ravenloft contains few meaningful decisions and a dull presentation that might have been novel prior to 1995.  The giantic plastic Dracolich does not make up for samey, washed out tiles and stacks of repetitive, artless cards.  Castle Ravenloft is outflanked by more immersive titles; fast doesn't have to be so boring!

Preliminary rating following initial 3P game.  I did enjoy it, and will likely play again.  Many good aspects of the game, especially how players are able to tailor their character to their own tastes.  

UPDATE:

After a second play, with my 7 year old daughter, I will contend that this is a solid 7.  It really is a simple game, and the co-op aspect to it lends to playing the game with people who don't get the deeper, more gamey aspects.  I've only played the first multi-player scenario in the book, so anything beyond I can't speak for.  But I will say that I loved playing it with my daughter, and she'll likely remember her conquering the final monster when she was on her last hit point.

This is a beta version of an excellent game. The pieces are fantastic, and the concept is terrific. Plus, the scenario format means endless ways to play. It's just a shame that the game wasn't more thoroughly playtested. The rules are horrible, and I haven't seen much clarification from the designers. And what on earth is up with the simplistic and missing art?

This game is just AWFUL. Seriously, it's based off a pre-existing game... shift it, change it, dumb it down; actual D&D is a fun game, I don't know how you could take it as a concept and distort it into an experience so intensely unenjoyable. It's slow, awkward, over-complicated, has too much set up and cool down, difficulty is inconsistent, and "multiple scenarios" is meaningless when they're all bad. It soured me to every buying a D&D board game without playing it first ever again.

I find this game very compelling, but difficult to get to the table (its size and theme make it difficult at times), but I love the customization of it.  It seems that the rulebook is only the basics, while each adventure teaches more rules, until the players have learned how to use all of the provided tokens and add them to their games at will.  I love that the new set is compatible, and expanding this experience.

RATING: 6.5
Great game to have in your solo quiver of options. You might not play it everyday but as dungeon crawls go it is really good for a fun splash into the genre.
I will say that confronting the same monsters all the time gets a bit repetitive. But you can spice this up by using cross-over beasts from the other two iterations of the game (Ashardalon & Drizzt), or by investing a bit in Dungeon Command.

First Impression:
If you like the d'n'd universe (I'm not a fan) or dungeon crawlers, but hate games overdoing it (like descent) and prefere a shorter experience, this game is for you.

I think it's close to the golden middle, but it still falls short in my eyes.

A very strong advantage is that it needs no dungeon master!
A very strong disadvantage is that it has encounter cards that randomly hit players regardless of their decisions/cooperation.

A rather mechanical game, which is disappointing because it comes from such a strong theme and roleplay root.

RATING: 3
Saw the theme, looked amazing.  Dungeon crawler, sounded good.  Coop, no overlord with options for single player gaming, sounded really good.

Anyway bought the game and was really really disappointed. 

It just feels too basic, too repetitive.  It's like the moment you start playing you're just dying and it's about trying to die as slow as possible, because then you just might finish the quest.
Move, grab a tile, put monster on tile, draw encounter - lose health, monster attacks - possibly lose more health.  Then you get to attack.  It'd be miles better if the monster didn't always get the drop on you, like if you had some mechanic there to give you a chance to surprise attack but nope.  Move, draw tile, monster goes on tile, draw encounter, monster attacks, you attack, next person does the same.

I think a big part of the disappointment was the theme looks amazing and the miniatures are really cool.  The tiles are too similar and the encounters could just omit all the flavour text and just put a number of how much health i'm going to lose.  

I think this one needs a revised edition really bad, redo the artwork on the tiles to make the rooms look different - there's really not much going on in most of those tiles.
  
Rework the mechanics to make the gameplay feel a little deeper, heck, even if they just made it so that I could get the drop on a monster sometimes would be better and to offset it they could make some of the monsters hit a bit harder or have more health.

Even though i've come down on it pretty hard (probably because i was overly hyped) I'm still tempted to hold on to this one just on theme alone, oh and the really really cool miniatures, just in case (this would be my dream come true) they release an expansion that turns it into castle ravenloft advanced! same cool theme, same cool miniatures, just new rules to make it feel like there's more going on there, oh and some new floor tiles to make it look less generic.  Oh please let that come true ...

RATING: 5
Okay as a build-it-as-you-go dungeon exploration game; my daughters played it and enjoyed it for simply that.  Fans of the Ravenloft RPG setting are not likely to find what they're looking for in this game; there's nothing evocative here; no rich theme.  The more you know about Ravenloft RPG, the more bland the game will be in comparison.

The hodge-podge blandness takes this from what might have been a 6, to a 5.

RATING: 6
Finally, one of these ameritrash games plays as a quick romp.  Its perfect length and depth for what the game offers, and provides a nice adventure given the time it takes.  It has a nice streamlined system.  Nobody has to play the "bad guy" so its a pure coop which is always a plus as well.  This is a game I would normally hate, but the ease and quickness of play make this a very nice pure coop that I would be happy to play most of the time.  I am nor ever will be a DnD player.  RPG's have little to no appeal to me.  The outcome of the game is probably more due to the random elements than your tactics, but I somehow think thats all coops.

RATING: 8
Hands down my favorite dungeon crawl of this sort. It's light and quick. No dungeon setup nonsense just drop the start tile, everyone pile on and get going. How cool is that? I like the co-op feel in this one without a DM or Overlord or whatever. This one really boiled the RPG feel down to a board game level and being an old RPGer I am so happy with that feel. 

This game scales so well and with the intuitive design of having each player activate the baddies you could play this with any number and still have the same gaming experience. Brilliant.

Not the really thematic game I was hoping for.

A good cooperative game that has the plus of the D&D theme. The 4th edition rules work really well in the board game. The production value is high - the minis are beautiful and the components give your money worth.

There is a good deal of luck in the game (dice rolls, blind draft of enemies, treasures, and so forth), that isn't far off what you will encounter in many RPG sessions.

This, nonetheless, isn't an RPG. No roleplay is required.

Being a mission-based game usually meant that the game isn't all that high in the replay value department, but since the game has a lot of random aspects, I guess this game can have more replay value than usual.

[Rated 2010/09/08, based on 2 plays]

I'm quietly very optimistic about this, after both wanting and managing to play two games back-to-back in an evening.

It seems to be scratching the "D&D-lite" itch without the downtime of Runebound, the analysis-paralysis of Doom / Descent, or the length of any of those.  (I really like all of those games, but I can play them a handful of times a year at best).

Fast-paced and varied - both games played very differently, and both were full of genuine gaming decisions on the part of all the players.

Doesn't seem like it really delivers on the Ravenloft theme, and some of the strategic decisions can seem contrived. But a reasonably solid little dungeon-crawler overall. Solo scenarios are both pretty awful, though.

RATING: 8
It's fast. It's flexible. It's fun. On & off the table in an hour or so. Can get a little repetitive on the game play. But Wrath of Ashardalong (and Legend of Drzzzt) compatibilities and the open-ended 'dungeon-crawl-on-the-fly kit' capabilities mean that these games can all be as exciting and flexible as you'd like them. 
A little bored with the core monsters, the 5th or 6th time you play? Pull down some of the user-made monsters, pick up old D&D mini's and you've got your own expansion. Want even more, grab and play any of a number of user-made addon secenarios.

We played this game about 5 times in one weekend.  Incredibly fun for the genre and streamlined.

Each player character has its own class with special abilities.  The minis are WAY cooler than chits, but it would have been ideal to have them painted.

The Adventures are creative and NOT repetitive.  It leaves you with the feeling of wanting more of it...expansions would be warmly received.

If you play Dungeons and Dragons and are a boardgamer, you will probably eat this game up, and ask for more please.  

The greatest innovation this rule set brings to the genre is the seamless elimination of the Dungeon Master, which allows EVERYONE to play as player-characters/adventurers. This works incredibly well, but of course it also eliminates the interactive story telling that comes along with role playing.

I really can't wait to see where WOTC takes this build.  I haven't been this excited about a boardgame (other than Summoners Wars) in a long time.

There were some ambiguities in the rulebook, so I docked it one point.  Otherwise this game is a clear 10 for me.

Reasonable dungeon crawler that does not require a DM (always a plus in my book as far as boardgames are concerned). Good value for money, as the box is really filled to the brim with miniatures, boardpieces and adventure cards. Unfortunately, I have lost my patience with these generic D&D dungeon crawlers - downtime is pretty bad with 4+ players, and the feeling of reward at the end just is not the same as with the exceedingly more difficult Warhammer Quest. Oh, and not all of the player characters are interesting to play with. All in all, it left me feeling a little MEH.

There's a lot of potential here that is undone by some really poor design decisions.  The way monsters appear results in a whack-a-mole kind of quality where they pop up on one player's turn and then die the next.  Very little drama and ends up being pretty dry. 

But the encounter deck is largely what ruins an otherwise decent beer and pretzels experience - lots of random damage that the players can do nothing about.  It tends to ruin any sense of strategy or planning that the players have.  

Ultimately the game has proven more tedious than fun most times we have played it although the kids still find it enjoyable.

I don't cooperate well in this game, but I was better the second time. Loved the miniatures, the variety of stories. I suspect the 2nd story might be more tense with more players (more than 2).

Also good for solo play.

Fun coop game with solid gameplay and fantasy element. I've only played two of the earliest scenarios - first scenario by myself and the second scenario with one other person, so I'm curious to see how this plays with 3+ players.

RATING: 6
I feel like there's so much potential in the game, but it sort of feels a little hokey when it's all over. I think the leveling mechanic is really one reason why-- you don't really feel more "powerful," which is one of the cool parts of any RPG-- whereas here you're starting at level 1 over and over.

Just got this one for X-mas (2010)...The unboxing of this game was pretty friggin' sweet.  Lots to punch and a bunch of cool minis.  Can't wait to get it to the table.  I think my wife's really going to like it...if not, SOLO adventuring here I come!

Really enjoyed the first few adventures. This is a fun little co-op.  We've won them all up to this point, but it always feels like we could lose at any moment.  Fun little dungeon crawl!

A very nice looking, easy to play co-op Dungeon Crawl type game.  We haven't completed the entire campaign play-through yet, but so far it is quite enjoyable, and starting to get more challenging as we progress further.  
The only thing that holds this back for me is the lack of experience building.  Anyone who has played RPGs before will feel that only going from Level 1 to a max of Level 2, (and potentially doing so on the first or second adventure) to be a bit underwhelming.  It's still fun and easy to learn and play.  Relatively quick to play each scenario also, but I can see myself making an attempt to adapt, or enhance the Board Game rules with the D&D 4th Edition rule books.

I love the D&D board games quite a bit. They are good dungeon crawlers, and I love that they're co-op instead of having someone run the monsters. This is a very solid game, and harder than the other ones that I have. I love Ravenloft, so this is a no-brainer for me.

Hmm, another dungeon crawler.  Dungeons and Dragons has been reinvented so many times in board game format that this admittedly faithful reinterpretation suffers from not being original enough, despite being the direct descendant of the flagship for every dungeon crawler ever.  I mean, really, this is just another version of healer, wizard, tank, and damage-dealer go into a dungeon to kill baddies.  Probably didn't help that the one scenario that I played was about as vanilla as it gets (go into dungeon, explore, kill big baddie by hitting his heart which is not kept in the same place as his corporeal body).  I'll play this again, but if this didn't have D&D on the box, I'm not sure I'd even give it that much.

The game's mechanics are very elegant! My group didn't have any problem playing from 3 up to 5 players. Even playing with 1 or 2 players it has been a satisfying experience.
It has still some tweaking needed to make this a complete game. One for all? Please, the game's components are good, but they are a bit too spartans in their design!

(10/10)  I would not typically seek out this type of game even though I did play a lot of D&D in my teens.  But it was set up on a game night and I jumped in to make it 5.   This was a delightful surprise.  Fun romp through the dungeon fighting monsters as a group.  I have played Descent once but it was a little too long for me.  This captured a little of that feel without the complexity - line of sight, customizing weapons/clothes/etc.  Would play again.

There's really nothing wrong with this game.  It works pretty well, and from what I hear, it captures the essence of D&D 4th edition pretty well, so there are two things going for it.  I think I'm just over the whole cooperative game craze, at least if you're not playing them with the right people.  There's something missing from the game if a player draws an encounter card and just says, "We all lose one hit point."  Why?  What happened?  What did we encounter that made us lose a hit point?  And if I'm asking the question, the proper response isn't "It doesn't matter"; this game is about theme, goddammit, so give me my theme!

I'll play this again, and try it with some different people if I can, but for now, it's just a fancy-looking cooperative game that falls into a long line of fancy-looking cooperative games.

Extremely dull game.  Everything was utterly random.  There are virtually no tactics to speak of.  This game takes absolutely no skill to play.  The end was rather anti-climatic.  

And I am a huge Ravenloft fan, so this was really, really disappointing.  No atmosphere at all to this game.  Even the tiles were boring to look at.  Hack and slash dungeon crawl.  We took out the dracolich without a lot of effort.

RATING: 7
The game's primary draw is that it is one of the few deep-dungeon adventures that finishes in an hour, and it does so in an all-for-one musketeer style that is pleasantly entertaining at worst and silly fun at best.

Make no mistake, though. There is nothing even remotely sophisticated about Ravenloft.  It revels in its low-strategy hijinks, and it does so with gusto.  But it does have moments of unexpected laughter, and it can be knocked out in the same amount of time that it takes to don your embarrassing LARP outfit - which is something that no other game in the genre can even come close to claiming.

There will be unfortunate instances where the game is as short as 15 minutes long, especially if your party stumbles into a slate of bone-rending traps from the dreaded Encounter deck. But since it's all in good cooperative fun, you and your family/friends can commiserate about your bad luck with dice and collectively look forward to launching another underground expedition in the near future.  Like in a few minutes, if you have the stamina to play again.

Played solely by adults, Ravenloft can tickle your hack-and-slash sensibilities, but whether you'd want to play it more than a few times with an older crowd is up for debate. Based on a handful of plays with my kids, it seems to have more staying power as a family game.  So while I don't see adults calling for the game regularly, if I'm in the mood for goofy card titles, off-kilter flavor text, and incessant monster attacks, then I'll be the first to grab my copy off the shelf and set it up.

And at the on-line price, it's definitely a bargain - especially if you've got a hankering for a skin-deep experience that contains as much haphazard fantasy as an old school Bag of Holding. Ah, nostalgia.

[Rated mostly as a family game.]

I haven't played D&D since the second edition, and I don't have time for regular role-playing anymore.  This game is nice because it gives a bit of that old school, hack-and-slash, grab-the-treasure feel in an hour or two without committing to actual role-playing.  Not a "serious" game and quite random.  Fun with my 10-year-old.

RATING: 4
I have to say that I really didn't enjoy this game as much as I thought I would. My 21 year old daughter and I gave up just before the second adventure was completed. We found the rules, cards and counters too fiddly and the game play too complicated to run smoothly. We were constantly forgetting the order of play and all of the conditional rules on the cards. We'd realize too late that we had forgotten to play a certain card or move a counter and we ran into questions that the rules could not clarify. We eventually got weary of being beaten down by monsters and encounter cards as we made our way through the castle which lacked the atmosphere of our beloved HeroQuest. In retrospect , I don't think the cooperative nature of the game really suits the dungeon crawl experience as you have to constantly alternate between your character and the evil things that attack it.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.18
That is a very thematic game assured to score high with D&D fans. The components are great, with lots of miniatures giving a great feel to a game and lots of scenarios to be played and replayed. Even though the price tag is high, it is quite worth the fun it provides.
The rules are very easy to grasp and do not take forever to be memorized. However the rule book needs some proofreading as some points are poorly organised. It ends with a full faq page, which shows that something is due about it at some time.
The various characters are fun even though one dimensional, but that is a board game, not a rpg. That contributes to make of the game an excellent appetizer for a full blow rpg experience.

RATING: 6
A light dungeon crawl game that doesn't need a DM, which in my opinion is a great blessing. I've been playing RPGs for over 15 years and I can count the number of times I haven't been DM on two hands.

I have few plays for now but there's enough variety in there that I plan for the game to remain fresh for a good while. Further, it's likely to be well supported in the next few years through DDI and added expansions.

It's been well liked by all players I've tried it with.

Fun but feels thin; not enough depth in the game system. Severe lack of unique abilities. Punished for everything you do. Nothing good literally ever happens to your characters....it almost feels defeating before you even start. Still a great way to scratch your D&D itch. I don't think this is something I will get on the table often...it's missing that "fun/excitement factor." I would play this again though as I enjoy the theme and it plays relatively quickly.

Easy enough to teach casual gamers. Components are top notch, and it looks impressive on the table. It definitely is missing something though; explorations and rewards?

HUGE potential for house rules and variants though. Not my sort of thing normally but I may give it a shot and come up with something interesting.

does a credible job of introducing 4th edition rules to a boardgamer audience.  lacks a little in flavor, since the dungeon tiles are very "samey", and the monster card art is dull.  the figures are nice, and the dracolich incredible.  the actual crawl is bland, at least for the first couple adventures.  it remains to be seen whether the later adventures are more fun.

Great bits, and love the idea, but it's clearly designed by D and D designers who clearly have no idea how to design a proper board game.

Castle Ravenloft is a very fun and addictive game. It will keep you on the edge of your seat. I'm a big fan of the adventure system that they've created with this and I can't wait to see how it will evolve over time with newer titles. The ever changing dungeons with the tiles is a really cool idea that allows the same scenerio to be different in a way each time it's played through.The 60 minutes play time is a big bonus and the ability to combined this with WoA is another huge plus.

Love these, I play with the kids and "DM" the monsters, but the standard rule work well too, you can get a dungeon crawl done fairly quickly with minimal set up time, and enjoy the flavor.. Descent Light

My favorite theme from D&D. Always enjoy a good dungeon crawler. I wish there were more ways to keep leveling your characters in a campaign. Great introductory tool to use to try and convert players into a real D&D campaign.

DnD for when you don't have time to play DnD. The minis and dungeon tiles are worth the price of admission alone. The game play is solid and there is no need for a DM so everyone gets to have fun.

After 1 Play: This wasn't at all interesting from a strategy standpoint.  It's probably good for people who want a quick role-playing fix, but that just doesn't describe me at all.

I have played this games scenarios a few times and the only thing i have to complain about is not enough levels for characters and boring looking tiles.

[Update] Well, 2.5 years later, it did catch the eye of my son. He loves it, which speaks well to it getting on the table again.

Not bad as a simple, light dungeon crawl. I do see its luster wearing out after a while, but if it catches the eye of my son, I'll certainly play it.

Just awful, every turn felt like the game was punishing you to the extent you did not feel like you were exploring a dungeon but instead were trapped in a punishment simulator.  DungeonQuest, a game where you can die on your very first turn through no fault of your own, was much better at simulating a dungeon exploration game, and that is far from a highly rated game.

Ravenloft has great components and, despite appearances when you take it out of the box, does take about an hour to play.  Multiple different scenarios add variety to the game.

If you played this game and felt slightly better about it than I did, you might want to try Wrath of Ashardalon as it somewhat improves on what I feel are the deep flaws of this game.

The cooperative system works to perfection! If you don't constantly discuss your tactics with your fellow players, you won't win many games.

A co-op dungeon bash game where you play against the board rather than a GM. Pretty solid, and some lovely minis.

RATING: 6
A building/auction/area control game.  This one didn't really "grab me".  It did have some neat balancing mechanisms, by which the action cards you don't play become the cards you have to wager with in the auction rounds.  I guess there wasn't anything I hated about it, I just didn't find it very engaging.

Not sure whether my group are idiots, but it took 3 plays before we were playing this correctly. 
Recommend only 4 players, as each player will have a turn to come first and its balanced.
Playing the game is quite fun, most strategy is guessing what the other players are going to do and then screwing them over.

Utterly the mother replacement for Monopoly.  A scholarly complex placement game with unique strategy levels that rise from the fog of war onto your third nostril potentially evading your opponents ambitious contemplations.  Not for the feeble minded which gives rise to the poor rating.  You will find that a baboon will rate a game based upon a video, to those fools I issue a challenge.  If you can beat me at this game I offer my vast subterranean empire. -Baduino

But seriously its a delightful mix of a Catan screw around with each other road feel and power grid strategy minus the disgusting grody paper money. Wash your hands after touching that stuff you know.

Out of all the euro style games I have. This is the one that my family is most happy to play. I think it must be mainly down to the visual appeal.

My only issue is that victory mostly comes done to a couple of key moments. One being the purchase of the first mall. If players dont recognise the importance of this, they have a significant disadvantage.

The addition of billboards to this updated version of Capital notches it up a point for me.  It adds one extra layer of decision making, and also gives you another "out" if you're in a game of chicken and need to pass for a round without playing a card.

Overall, a touch better than the original Capitol!

Area majority, auction game. Need to use cards smartly. Not a gateway game as the rules are a little fiddly (although game should run smoothly after a few plays). Weight and chaotic level and game play feelings are similar to "The Secret of Mount Cristo", but this one has better 2-player experience and the accomplished feeling of building things. The latter does have better components and art. Might only keep 1 between the two.

Much better than I was expecting.

My wife and I played and we both throughly enjoyed it. However, using all the blocks in a 2-player game seemed to be a waste and made the game too easy.

We've decided to eliminate the largest block from each district. This should make the game much more tense. Looking forward to giving it a try!

Got it cheap. I figured something by Alan Moon was worth $15. Played it three player, thought it was just okay and effectively decided it was going on the trade pile.

But I wanted to get in one more play of Skyline 3K before I got rid of it, this time with four players to see if there were any noticeable differences, expecting I was going to unload it regardless.

WOW. Glad I tried it with four.

Criminally underrated four player game that's all about timing, timing, timing.

Simple rules lead to engaging strategy decisions. Interesting tension between using cards for actions and using them as currency to buy improvements.  Careful planning for future rounds essential to victory.  Limited number of roofs available is significant -- avoid using all roofs of one kind too soon. Game includes trackable secret information: your opponents' hands. Best play requires remembering at least what colors of contracts other players hold.

I never got a chance to play Capitol, but this game reminds me a lot of Manhattan, with a few other elements thrown in such as the Auction for improvements.  I enjoyed Manhattan, and I think anyone else who did would enjoy S3K.  The problem is that after a few plays, the game is just too predictable.  I'll play it, but I regret having bought it at full price.

RATING: 3
Really dissappointed in this one as it is so short. There are only 4 rounds and it really feels like it should have been double that.

Three types of cards allow you to do different things and are also your bidding resource. Initially buildings need to be only a single floor high in a district and after that same height or one higher. 
there are floor cards and roof cards that allow to you build buildings and then the district cards allow you to place completed buildings into colour coded districts each round each block is evaluated with point being awarded for the amount of green space in the block. 

The cards also have a value which is the value of a bid. this varies wildly from 1 up to 8 which is such a swing making auctions very unpredictable.

Nice components but poor execution. Game should have been 6 or 8 rounds instead of the four that it is.

Sold in 2016.

This reminds me a little of Manhattan.  Best with 4 players, a failure with 2. Easy rules, quick play but with strategy.  Ending the game with using all the buildings you have built, or not running out of roofs can be difficult. (Remake of Capitol).  A good family & gateway game.

A city building, area control game with great art by Josh Cappel.  Its a decent game, plays fine, easy to explain to new players.  Unfortunately, it is also missing that certain something that makes a game above average.  It is a sound design but it lacks excitement.  I think this one is just a solid "meh".

I have to say that I have a much better impression of S3K after a second go. Balancing your cards for both the construction and auction phase is quite nifty and you sometimes find your plans having to change on a dime depending on what people do. There are enough strategic decisions that have to be made so that you can feel quite involved. The limited rounds also adds to the tension. Tinges of luck might sway the game (depending on what cards are available during the 'draw cards' step) but overall it felt like everyone was on level footing. Still, it's a game that has been vastly superseded by others.

Very nice area majority game, with hand management and auction. 

Easy to explain, with some interesting decisions.

May be a just 10 minutes (!) too long, especially because at the end a lot depends on the values of the cards you get for the last auction(s). Good thing is, the game stays balanced all along.

I like the design and the components.  

Wouldn’t play it with 2: with 3, the board was already almost too big.

Fine area control game with the novel mechanic of building your pieces before placing them on the board. It works, but I think it requires four players, and there are many better games for this number.

Updating my comment now that I've actually played the game with other people, raising my rating from a 7 to an 8.  I still really like the artwork and visual elements of building taller towers and billboards.  The board really feels alive and each district can look distinct.  It's certainly unique and dripping with theme.

One of my complaints from my previous comment was in the randomness of the contract cards.  By this, I mean if you don't have control in a spaceport district or two, you are limited to 6 card draws.  Considering you'll probably need at least one block and one roof card, if not more, you might get to draw 4 contract cards.  If luck isn't on your side, you might be totally screwed out of fighting for a third of the board.  This can be crucial, though I realize now that billboards slightly mitigate this.  At least you can lay stake to a district you might not be able to get into.  However, you give the person(s) there extra points.

In addition to the randomness of the contract colors, you can also get jerked around a little in the bidding wars if the cards you drew all came with lower numbers.  This can be mostly mitigated by having three decks to choose from but is worth mentioning.

My second complaint from previous comment was in the scoring.  Primarily, I wasn't happy with the scoring in regard to not having enough incentive to move from second to first place in a district.  Now my problem is more that the malls are too powerful.  The last turn of the game feels uneventful because it's typically better to save your cards to win a mall rather than try to expand anywhere.  Maybe if the malls were a flat point bonus, you could focus more on the area control part, and not the "drop all your cards on the last space mall" part which seems inevitable no matter how you play the game.

There are some very interesting aspects with other players, though I think you really would need 4 players for this game to shine.  With 3, we had just a triangular war, where nobody ever tried to get into a district that already had two other players in it.  With 4, you'd have more competition for less space, buildings would be taller, and more emphasis would be put on blocks and roofs rather than trying to spread out through contract cards.  That's interesting too though, that the player count can fundamentally alter the flow of the game.  I definitely want to play this one some more.

I like area control games, but it's easy for them to get a little too overzealous in throwing obstacles in the way of players who just want to get some pieces down on the board.  This is a good example.  To put down a building, you have to have the appropriate card for that area, the right kind of building, the proper height of building, which takes several cards to build up, and you have to do it before anyone else can.  And in the end, there is a decent chance of getting nothing whatever out of it.   (1 play)

The theme makes more sense than Capitol, but it's still kind of ridiculous when you think about it. And they also got rid of the terrible scoring columns. But now that I think about it, I'm not sure that Capitol was really screaming for a rerelease, and I'm not sure that Skyline 3000 offers anything new or exciting. The one change I saw, regarding reserving spots, is one I don't really like - I prefer simply having to commit and be ready.

A relatively quick game, a bit in the vein of an abstract like Metropolys. Since it's area control, with many players often the outcome of a game comes down to whom each player decides to target, and whether you can either fly below the radar or play defensively enough that you aren't targeted. Luck of the draw plays an outsize role, in that it can limit your choices of action. The first two auctions can be unbalanced too -- they feature must-have items, and it's worth it to risk 2 or 3 high cards to win the item, since the reward is that you get 2 extra cards. But perhaps in future games there will be more variety in the strategic approaches that will balance out this aspect. Aside from critiques of the mechanics and balance, the game itself is delightfully themed, nice components, engaging artwork, and it is fun to play.

Light game that plays rather quick. Two player doesn't provide much in the way of competition, as there are too many areas to expand to (perhaps limiting the number of locations would help.)

Four player game was a bit more competitive. If all but one person passes, the last person has a chance to play all billboards and lock everyone out of a block, providing a massive amount of points (especially if done early in the game.)

Overall, I'm not too impressed.  Not one we will likely play (unless there is an interesting variant...)

On its surface it appears to be a simple little area control game, but it ends up playing like a giant game of chicken.  Like in many area control games, going last is good, but this one features a number of ways you can stall to avoid passing out of a round.  Additionally, players end up telescoping their future moves by what they do on their player boards (and what cards they take, if you can remember), so it really ends up being a game of stare-downs and one-upsmanship in a way I didn't enjoy.

An area control game, driven by hand mangement on drawing contracts and building factors. 
The interesting aspect is building your pieces before placing on the board, so you would need to anticipate whats going on the board. Seems the megamalls at the end are the decisive factor and the aslt turn seems to be a bidding war for it. 
Think it needs to be a 4 player for best.

Blind bidding, area control and development via cards. Planning required because there will always be something (roofs, building blocks, real estate, zoning regulations) that limits your expansion.

Suffered  a little w/ less than 4 players because of the space but i think this game is under rated.  A little chess like so it can be a bit dry.  Good thinking game though.

Nice pieces, orange as a player color. This rating is probably a floor, and could go up with further plays, but I'm not going to be rushing to those plays.

Found at Works Canterbury - £7.99

After first training game, looks like a good area control/auction game. Plenty of options per turn... do you go all out to build/place buildings, or hold cards back for the auctions.

Decent game with area control and auction elements. It's a game of inches, with a tight race to the finish. For some reason, it just doesn't excite me. The scoring is too forgiving, a complaint I have with Alan Moon's Airlines Europe.

I don't know if we really need a reworked version of Capitol.  Our game took a while too, plus the game lends itself to kingmaking.  I'll spend my game buying capital elsewhere.

It's a nice euro with a blend of majority and auction mechanics, nice bits and the rules are simple enough. It plays well but nothing too fancy. For a game of this lenght and weight, I'd rather play Acquire, so off to the trade pile.

It's a fair game of both short- and long-term strategy, but need the right set of strategically minded people to play against.

I liked Capitol so I Tanga'ed this for $14.99...guessing that means next week it's going to be $9.99. 

Yep it's Capitol alright. I like this game though. I lost tonight's game by being 1 "dollar" short for the bid for the MegaMall. Interesting thing is no one thought I was even in the running for any place other than last. Had I had the 1 dollar more I'd have won it. I like games where you can hide your direction like this from time to time. Cool stuff.

Love the cat-and-mouse planning, the amount of control, and the way this game plays out over a limited play session. The billboards and scoring track are small but welcome improvements over the original Capitol.

Skyline 3000 is a straight up area control game where you use cards to build and then deploy buildings in different areas. The first building in an area must have a single floor, then subsequent buildings must match or exceed the number of floors of the highest building in that area. You have two roof types in your color, and once an area has one roof type that's all that can be built there. You only get a handful of roofs, so you won't be building more than twelve buildings. Whoever has the most floors in an area gets majority and two points. Then the first and second player score any points for improvements in the region. You can use leftover cards to bid for improvements in three auctions per turn. 

I had seen this game in the discount bins of online stores so I wasn't expecting much. I enjoyed playing it, but I wonder about replay value. There aren't a lot of points in the game and you can't build too many things. You're likely to get in an area control fight which spends several of your builds on a single area. There are two improvements you can win in auctions that double an area's scores and I think those may end up being what decides a lot of games. Ultimately, I just don't think this game will hold up over time.

I played a couple games of this re-themed Capitol game at Unity Games XVI.  Unfortunately, I forgot a couple rules, so we weren't playing it correctly, and I want to try it again. You must build the same height or one taller in each block, and you don't shuffle the cards when you make new draw decks. Otherwise, it played well and all players enjoyed it. NICE BITS!!! Good player interaction, with lots of overtaking and betting, etc. Really nice Z-Man edition! (Finally played correctly at The Grid, and won! You do shuffle the cards! Buildings never got very high - 4 was the tallest.) Lots of wasted buildings. Got to play at Oasis of Fun 2010 in Atlanta, one player, after all others passed, dumped all his billboards in one block, closing it off for the rest of the game, and couldn't be beaten.

Picked this up at The Works for just £7.99 - that place is so worth watching for euro games! We are usually 2-pl and on first play, whilst getting rules and strategies straight, it played ok. I could see that folks idea of taking out a block per colour for 2-pl might be a good idea, but one of us finished with about a 20pt lead by gunning for the Megamalls. The phases are fun, the fact that everyone does each phase one after the other keeps interest up, the components are really nice (greenspaces a little difficult to see, might buy trees to swap out) and the auction mechanisim is fun. Classed it as light medium as the rules are blissfully simple (thanks Alan Moon) and yet there's a lot of of "Ooooh I seeeee.." moments to working out strategies in the first play. Good little hidden gem and a bargain at the price it's floating around at

(2/10)  After 1 4p game - I have not played Manhatten and I understand this is similar.  I found it to be a nice lighter quick game (only 4 rounds) with a nice mix of area control and auction mechanics.  Will play again.

This game doesnt have the merits to be called a game. It is boring and the only logical move is to do the exact samething than the previous player to prevent him to get a majority in a sector.... totally stupid piece of crap.

area control in a sort of 2-step procedure...build your towers, then place them on the board...cards are used for actions and bidding for special tiles, so choose and use wisely...only 4 rounds and it's over, which means there's not much time to strategize...just play tactically and go for the most points you can, but going last seems to be the best position each round...

Some interesting mechanisms.  If played at high speed, and finished in half an hour, this would be a [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b], but it's just not quite interesting enough to me to warrant several hours of play with newbies and/or AP players… no matter how pleasant the opponents are.  :meeple:

Needs four players,  3 players leaves too much space so there's no competition for area.

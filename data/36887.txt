I'm not a grog, but I am a wargamer.  A combination of Martin Wallace, discs, cubes, and wooden pieces shaped like mounted horses, artillery pieces, and soldiers gave me pause.

Instead, this was one of my greater and more pleasant surprises.  It uses a unique and innovative twist of the area-impulse mechanic.  Different types of combat results in different combat results tables and those and the morale check table uses die roll modifiers and column shifters based on terrains, formations, support, and such.  In other words, things that make my inner wargamer happy are in this box.  It has great solitaire capability and great PBEM capability.

The components are top-notch: beautiful mounted board, one page player aids that are thorough and useful.  Full color instructions that are clear and contain many examples and excellent designer notes.  It also has sharp looking wood pieces, and if this offends you, keep in mind, that it is only a designer preference: cardboard counters could be created and used and would take nothing from the game, and you would end up with a pretty cool area-impulse game that could look like something from Avalon Hill.

Kuddos to Mr. Wallace for making a legitimate war game with innovative ideas.

When modern game designers delve into wargames, the result is tight clean and innovative takes on classic game material.  The battle of Waterloo is very well studied and well represented in several games.  What this brings to the table is approachability.  The mechanism of variable turn segments/orders known by the opponent but not by the active player may sound like its not all that new or interesting, but that is a serious error.  While simple, it is a key and quite fascinating element that makes this take on the battle really stand out.  Its a whole new way to see the fog of war and I suspect we'll see other designers bit this idea up and incorporate it in other games.

RATING: 7
Tentative rating based on one play, and may go up with more plays.  I had my concerns about how good it would feel and play using wooden pieces rather than counters, and I put those fears to rest.  The wooden pieces easily show formations, and you don't have to dig through a counter stack to find out what's there.  I think that this game does a very good job of modeling the conflict, especially the use of mixed forces.  Using cubes to represent step losses and their removal reinforcements also works very well.  

One quibble is that the rulebook shows its euro heritage, rather than a solid wargame foundation.  I found that it didn't have the nitty gritty detailed style that you need in a wargame manual to make sure that all the abiguities are resolved. Be sure to read the FAQ.  At this stage also don't know about play balance and replayability.  It seems as if a competent French player has a pretty strong advantage.

Despite the controversy around the meeples, this is a true wargame, and an excellent one.  I have been looking for a fun, manageable, and good simulation of the battle--have tried many--and this is it.  I've seen Hougoumont eat up French infantry when it should have been a sideshow,  the British cavalry riding down the French and then be destroyed, La Haye falling after a desperate, seesaw struggle.  Lots of interesting mechanisms--love the cubes and reinforcement mechanic,  and am impressed (and frustrated) by the great power and greater fragility of the cavalry!  Get over the meeple thing and play it!

Really fine wargame.  The "limited orders" mechanic is terrific and wonderfully reproduces the lack of global, instantaneous command and control in 19th century warfare.  Players really have to prioritize what they want to accomplish in each order phase.  I will play this anytime.  UPDATE:  There is a strategy ("the french human wave") that can make this game end quickly.  The Allied player must react quickly to prevent Napoleon from marching to Brussels.

I've played this twice and find it fun and interesting. It takes a few plays to understand how the units work and the importance of formations and units. once your past this curve the stratigic and tactical levels of the game come to light. My fears of the units being cumbersome and fiddle proved nonexistent. This could be worthy of an 8 rating. "If it's not Wallace it's crap!".

Comment based on first play - the mechanics are all brilliant but I am concerned about the vicotry conditions (based on killing a certain number of units) that break the game and make it too bloody, and quick.  Our game ended before the Prussians entered with both sides over their casualty limit.

1. Design - beautiful wooden pieces, easy to use and transparent. Solid map depicts all important places of famous battlefield
2. Mechanics - activation tiles creates uncertainity, action discs, morale checks, damage cubes and others stuff all together gives to us Napoleonic feel of history. All in easy to learn rulebook with clear and helpful examples.
3. Play - what I look in a wargames is a simple methods of creation realistic situations. In this Waterloo we act as Army Commanders, facing up real decisions,problems and difficulties which have both commanders historically. Highly recommended

RATING: 8
Very original "Eurostyle" and thought provoking system which rather nicely portrays the ebb and flow of the historical battle. Rules are mainly straightforward, well written and illustrated - though there is an error in one of the given examples, and a couple of badly explained concepts which require interpretation. Lots of depth to be found in play however, and much to like here.  Superb wooden components which you will either love or hate - I think they're rather unique and fun, and suit the style of the overall game, but your milage may vary. One minor problem may be that the board is too small for the number of pieces, and causes the game to look somewhat too cluttered. Nevertheless, this is another tour de force for Martin Wallace and gets an 8 from me (would easily be a "9" if the board was a bit larger and rules were a little clearer on all points...)

Martin Wallace' take on the battle of Waterloo. Pretty complex game, but once you get the rules, play is pretty straightforward. 
I don't know enough of the battle of Waterloo to say if it's a good simulation or not. However, gameplay is tense - very tense. 
As the napoleonic era is not my favourite and I already have enough 2-player games, it's not on my wishlist - despite being a pretty good game.

I couldn’t help but notice superficial similarities between this game and Napoleon’s Triumph, which I first played before Waterloo. I imagine most of these parallels are due to the fact that both games are from the same time period and feature the same historical militaries and thus are likely to have similar mechanical foundations, however I would not be surprised if Mr. Wallace was inspired in some ways by Napoleon’s Triumph. 

I think I liked Waterloo a bit more than Napoleon’s Triumph, but am willing to admit that I have no real feel as to which is the superior game after one play of each. Both had minor elements that I disliked (the hidden unit information after engagement of Napoleon’s Triumph and the random unit activation of Waterloo), but on the whole I found them to be pleasant, engaging experiences that I would definitely repeat, though I am unlikely to purchase either game. 

My one major concern about the game is the random unit activations. It seems that being able to get an unusually high or unusually low number of activations as the French could have a big impact on the game and a player’s ability to potentially win. As it stood, I was able to win as the allies soon after the Prussians arrived based on unit elimination, but if I had been a little bit more sharp about the game, the entire experience could have been worse for my opponent, as I could have greatly reduced the number of actions he could have taken on one turn without seriously effecting my own. It may turn out this is an empty concern, and I admit I grow less worried about it the more I think about it, but it still is a concern, and one that will not be mitigated until I play it one or more times. I won’t find this further play to be a chore, thankfully, and currently rate the game a strong 6. It could easily go up to a 7 if it turns out that my concerns are unwarranted.

RATING: 4
Nice looking game, but there is little flow to the play.  I like the actions tokens, but they can be overly punitive or rewarding. 
The charts are not well presented or designed, would have been better as a play aid.  The Euro look is deceiving as this is a hard core war game. The casualty blocks are interesting and flexible.  There are quite a few pluses and innovations but they just don't congeal.  Too bad it's plays just like a tactical dice throwing, hope for the best.  Napoleon is a way better game for the flow is smooth.

An euro-wargame. I love the fact that you dont know exactly how many actions youll have in your turn. A lot of dice rolling but I think that at the end, the best player is always the winner. As all the games that recreate a single battle (Napoleon´s Tryumph is a welcome exception for me) its repleyability is not huge but its good enough to resist one play monthly without getting scripted. Good game.

RATING: 7
Overall I like this game and I think that the designer has managed to reflect the tactics of the era with simple, elegant and intelligent rules.

Anyway, based on my experience the game has two problems:

1) My games are always so short that the Prussians almost do not appear! My Prussian units look completely new, as I still have not used them.

2) I am not happy with Cavalry vs Cavalry rules. Too much randomness for such an important aspect of battles. And there is not any advantage if you have numerical superiority (apart from being able to repeat the die roll more times if you fail it). Maybe three or two cavalry units against only one should have some kind of possitive modifier (we had a case where three French cavalry units lost against just one British! - unusual but perfectly possible). 

Connected to this, I have another thought: a lone cavalry unit -even a tired one- effectivelty can destroy all infantry units in its same area if they fail the morale check. This may seem excessive.

Okay: Tactical - Napoleonic - Easy

Plus:
-Great theme for a game, especially for a Euro / wargame crossover!
-Great components
-Interesting mechanisms, especially the damage
-Morale check mechanism is simply brilliant (see below)
-Very original and fresh approach of a wargame. I particularly like the function of the individual units infantry / cavalry / Artillery
-The skirmish is brilliant; very simple in its execution yet so efficient to shift focus. A few hits somewhere is an attractive target to assault.
-Real challenging decissions and dice guarantee for excitement. 

Minus:
-It is can be a long due to analysis paralysis by the French player. A clock or so would be good here.  
-Allied are fairly static at the beginning due to a lack of discs. Sometimes it seems the French can do whatever they want to. However, this feel is fading the more I play as I like the challenge to win time for the allies till the Prussians come in. 
-I suspect areas like Papelotte, La Haie Sainte and Hougoumont should be treated as individual areas. 
-Replay value is a worry
 
A refreshing game in all aspects: system and components are unlike any other game I know of.
For a wargamer this is an easy and quick playing game. Impressions are good and will edit once I have played more. 
I have played five times and the game keeps intriguing me to find out the best French strategy. Direct Aussaults cen be very bloody and I love the damage system in this game. Cavalry battles though can be very frustrating (50/50 affair) but it's all about how to use your forces effectively. 

Revisited: replay value is limited, downgraded.

For Waterloo enthusiasts like me a must have but also for Euro gamers who would like to try a wargame as well as wargamers I can highly recommended it.

Un jugador es atacante y el otro defensor, estando el juego bastante bien compensado, al principio el atacante tiene la ventaja y cuando se pasa el ecuador de la partida la tendencia se invierte, ganando el defensor refuerzos.

Tiene una mecánica de acciones que se basa en el gasto de discos de colores (ésos que le gustan tanto a Wallace), si no tienes discos de ese color no puedes hace esa acción.

Me da la sensación de que es un juego que se puede quemar rápidamente, ya que el escenario y la disposición inicial siempre son los mismos, es decir, no muy rejugable.

Looks like a eurogame but is overly complicated for the cuteness of the pieces.  Pieces fall over easily and especialy crowded so that you knock them over.

RATING: 5
OK, I've played this twice now, and my seven rating is increasingly a rating of the game's theoretical potential. Both games have ended in four turns with both armies heavily bloodied. Maneuvering feels stagnant. Attacks are difficult to carry through with any force. Units seem difficult to defend against cherry-picking (artillery from infantry and infantry from cavalry). I clearly haven't grokked the way this game is supposed to work. I'm not getting much reward so far, and I've put about 7-8 hours into it. I can't imagine why you'd play this over Commands & Colors, which is not only a lot faster, but would appear to be deeper as well. 

The game's key mechanism - taking a turn of 2-5 actions without knowing how many at the outset, has yet to yield anything but empty angst. I'm guessing that you're supposed to do lots more positioning with your forces, and attack rarely. I'm willing to give the game once more chance to see if it can last longer, play smoother, and actually engage us. Otherwise this rating is headed straight for a 5. 

Update: Been a few months since I've played, and the more I think about it, the less I can excuse a game for not showing much promise over the course of eight hours of play. Rating downgraded to a six. I'd give it one more shot but Waterloo seems like a failure as a real wargame and a light wargame both.

Testing the waters as to weather i'll get into this wargame or not. Eurogames seem to be about efficiency and wargames about positioning, so it will be interesting to see how this 'Euro-wargame' plays. I like the concept and I think with a couple of plays to get the rules this could be a great game. Its by Martin Wallace too, so I have high expectations. ** Still waiting for this to arrive**
Not sure that my playgroup will enjoy this.

Enjoyed my first playing, particularly the focus on combined arms and formation changes.  Game moved quickly for us (and ended early midway with a French victory), though I think we would have come in between 3 and 4 hours for the full title.  Allies got walloped pretty hard, but I'm not sure if this was the result of inexperience (Allied player had read the rules but little more before we started playing).  Felt like the game didn't showcase the variable action point mechanism as well as it could have and the lack of stacking restrictions can lead to some very silly outcomes in play.

Waterloo is an interesting game and I really like the activation system and the way the uncertainty about the length of your turn affects the choices you have to make.

Played once.  Very tough game to judge after one game.  I THINK it's good; I enjoyed it for the most part.  I like some of the slight twists on typical Napoleonic war games, and the combat results were fairly painless (though not completely) to determine.  I'd like to play at least once again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
While some interesting twists exist in this game, I just don't appreciate war games that use the method of rolling 6's for hits with modifiers.  I both love and hate the randomness of the die roll and the uncertainty it brings to the battlefied - but it is extremely frustrating too.  

I found both the block draw by the opponent that informs how many actions you get between 2-5 on your turn clever in that you don't know exactly when your turn is over.  As well, the wound system using cubes was clever in how that functioned and could be manipulated when taking casualties and in morale checks.  

Memo to self - when attacking and defending, combined forces are very helpful.  Unless desperate, it generally is best not to attack a combined arms defense with just one unit, particularly horse.  

I don't expect I will play this often - but time will tell.

This is badly unbalanced out of the box in favour of the French. If they deliberately overstack they can pack an unstoppable punch. If you bring in stricter stacking limits and/or penalties for overstacking it will help the Allied player.

I love the Boneymeeples!  Seems more like a simulation than many traditional hex and counter wargames.  Formation; morale; attrition; battlefield congestion are all faithfully replicated in the game system.  Eurogamers who might give a Martin Wallace wargame a try may be turned off by the amount of die rolling and rules errata and ambiguities.

I am stunned by what you get in the box. A LOT of wood. This is a beautifully presented and finished board game that harkens back to the long-lost days of musty Monopoly sets - and I don't mean that as a criticism. Some have scoffed at the 'Boneymeeples' and "Wellymeeples", but I think they're beautiful. This is a game that is a tactile pleasure and I hope it brings me many happy hours of play. They've totally lied about the play time though. I mean, even by the conservative estimates game companies normally publish, we've played a couple of 3-hour games that didn't get past the 3rd turn before being abandoned and a 5 1/2-hour game that ended after 4pm (turn time). This is slower than the real battle! Good game, but quite involved. Luckily, I can play with someone who's completely across the combat system, because I'd be forever making mistakes.

Have only played once so far and while I appreciate the design and some of the mechanics, I didn't really enjoy it and thought the offensive/defensive status didn't really work at the operational level being portrayed. Not opposed to trying it agaim, but with so many other games I might not get around to it.

RATING: 6.5
A bit of a strange beast.  My rating probably tempered by the fact I'm not so interested in tactical battles of the Napoleonic era.  Love the number of action pull system: works very well, and love to see it in more games.  Not sure what I think of all the bits laying on their sides and all.  We initially played with cavalry underpowered, but now I see their value.  May need to think about this one for a while before making a final rating.

RATING: 7
Rating and comments based on only a single play. The plusses: combined arms convincingly modeled, game generated a good narrative, rules seemed tight. The minuses: action felt very telescoped (no sense of historical French lethargy), and the celebrated activation mechanic never really felt all that "tense."

RATING: 8
An excellent simulation of the battle of Waterloo played with cute or hideous wooden soldiers (take your choice!). The key mechanism of the game sees players taking between 2 and 5 actions in a round - the twist being that your opponent knows how many actions you have but you don't until you've taken them. The overall pattern of the battle is reflected in the French having more actions early on in the game and the Allies receiving extra actions and Prussian support later. Of the games I've played so far it would appear that the French have to maximise their impact early on before the Allies gradually edge back in to contention (like the real thing!) Overall, this is a very original game. 
** I've now played 'Waterloo' a few times and each play has been very different. I've increased the rating from 8 to 8.5 **

Good 2 player wargame (sorta) with meeples!  The rules can be vague at places, but after you get a grasp of them, play is fairly quick and the realism excellent.

You may need to check BGG threads to find answers or guesses as to how to resolve some rare situations.

RATING: 6
A lot of die-rolling and repetitive actions. Non-defensive infantry seems too weak against cavalry charges, i.e. the elimination of infantry is almost automatic. This feels strange.

I admit I have not too much experience with the game, but it seems to easy to inflict 13 (or 16, respectively) casualties against Wellington (Napoleon). The game will end much too early; the arrival of the Prussians is not important.

On the positive side, the endless waves of attacks rolling against Haye Saint and Hougonmont has a funny dynamic.

The game is worth a try, but not completely my cup of tea.

RATING: N/A
I have played this game four or five times over the last year or so.  We've only finished once because of starting too late at our board game sessions on Monday evenings.  The game is about three hours to set up and play.  We keep leaving ourselves with about two.  

At any rate, I think the game is border-line genius.  In all of my years of playing all sorts of Napoleonic games and miniature rules, I have never seen one that so simply, yet elegantly and accurately, reflects the relative balance between arms as this game does.  The combat sequence works flawlessly.  There is a lot of luck involved with the dice, but that's war.  You can't make your side shoot better and stand more bravely on the day of battle.  Way too many games want to micro manage this aspect. 

The fragile nature of cavalry is really well represented.  Run around willy-nilly with it and it's wasted.  Yet, as the game points out, they're not really all dead, they're just spent for the day and so they don't count against you for victory conditions. If I had a nickle for every game that has cavalry units charge and destroy everything multiple times over, well, I would have a lot of nickles.  In Waterloo, you would have to be pretty lucky to carelessly use your cavalry and have much of it left later in the game.  Rarely, did it successfully charge repeatedly in reality.  It happened but not often.  In Waterloo, you will find units indeed fortunate to still be fresh after several uses.  This element is way too poorly represented in most "serious" games.   

The terrain effects, command (which is a clever touch not knowing how many activations one will have), skirmishing rule (wonderfully simple), all work almost shockingly well in my opinion.  

No, this is not the real hardcore simulation that some games maybe are.  But, in some ways, it's really more accurate than most other games on the subject.  And an enjoyable few hours.  Beautiful components, too.

Really a brilliant effort by Martin Wallace.

--May2009-- Arrived.
--Sept2009-- Finally got it to the table!  It's got much better sense, tempo, and feel than I'd been lead to believe.  The flow of the battle was believable, and the outcomes variously expected or outrageous as the dice rolled.  But in the end, the experience was really excellent.  I'd love to play again, and am very happy to have bought it.
--Jan2017-- Traded away years ago.  And, sadly, not missed.  While the game was interesting, I've had absolutely no opportunity to play anything remotely like it.

I like Martin Wallace games in general. Especially Brass and Automobile. Then when my friend suggested playing Waterloo I was fairly interested. I think somebody said this is a eurogame and wargame hybrid and it certainly feels like it. A fair share of luck is involved but also some mechanics which are not that usual in wargames. I like the fact that this plays under three hours and even if we managed to get some rules wrong in the first game it doesn't have that complex rules. Also the balance with the French attacking in the beginning and the initiative shifting to the allied when the Prussians begin arriving makes the game interesting to both sides. A very good game indeed.

I'm not sure I'd want to play this again, and although it's not a simulation per se, it does show Martin Wallace is a pretty brilliant fellow who lets you get the feel of Napoleonic warfare via pink and orange meeples.

Wallace-loo /is/ a wargame. You roll dice to fire, you make morale checks, you activate units with commands. I think its biggest problem is that, well, it's Waterloo. It's a dull race-against-time frontal assault.

Frankly, the "napples" are only one-step away from iconic figures on your counters. I didn't find them particularly attractive or helpful, but neither did they detract from the experience. The damage "cubes", on the other hand...

At first, I bought this for the meeples (in contrast to the opinion of many horrified grognards). Then, when I first set it up, this looked like an overcrowded wooden mash on a such a small board. Finally, in playing, I got to like the meeples again, though they'd be classier on a larger map (but Wallace has good reasons to work on standard size).

While being no expert at all, and thus not being qualified in assessing historicity, I really like the way the system handles the interactions between different arms (as far as I understand, key to capturing the spirit of Napoleonic warfare). 

There are claims of a potential problem with the French pressing very hard early on, systematically overstacking, and having a big chance of an early victory. Didn't explore this. Won't be a big deal in my few solo games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I really wanted to like it, and I think that there are some fantastic ideas here, but i didn't get to actually play the game as I kept getting two actions every turn (while my opponent was getting 3, 4, or 5).  So, I just sat watching my guys get ravaged turn after turn until I was dead.  The game isn't broken, per se,  but when this happens it just isn't fun.

That said, I really liked what I saw when my opponent was playing.  In fact so much so that it came as a bigger disappointment to me that the game wasn't letting me play.  It is like having a relationship with someone that constantly drops their coins in front of the slot machine, if you know what I mean.  Wink, wink.

Fortunately, the game doubles up the tiles.  I don't think I'll play this again unless I split the tiles into two separate bags (one for each player).  Where the second to last draw causes a remix.  I'll give a review then.

I'd probably give it a 7.5 or an 8 if it actually put out.

Self admittedly, I am not a big wargamer. I find the oodles of rules and exceptions just too hard to digest and the work doesn't necessarily equate to a worthwhile payoff. But with Waterloo Mr. Wallace has created a very nice wargame that almost any advanced Eurohead can sink his teeth into. This is the first game that was at once long and complex but digestable. First off, the wooden pieces are amazing and interestingly enough, don't overcrowd the board. I love love love the blind action points mechanic where the opponent picks a tile out of a bag with a number from 2-5 but the active player has no idea how many actions he has. It makes for some killer planning. The skirmishes are quite simple to resolve as there is a set order to everything and the allocation of damage cubes brings a resource management aspect to the game. All in all, I would definitely play this again. A keeper IMO.

One of my favorite historical and more balanced battles combined with one of my favorite designers.  A good game system for a wargame, and make no mistake that this is a wargame in a Euro-package.

A much much more exciting game than our first with Geoff (Fr) beating me be ending a round with 13 kills over the allies 15(needed 16 for the win). some nice combos with cavalry & infantry happening and some long bloody 5 point action rounds which were killers for the Allies. Well done G. Look forward to a rematch.

Two aspects of Waterloo are really great: the hidden action counts and the rampaging cavalry units.  Everything else is at least pretty good, so this one looks solid.

Things do get wacky at times, but that just makes the game fun.  Speaking of which, in my gaming group, the Prussians have never entered play. The French have always been sufficiently aggressive that the game is decided before Prussian entry.

[Note to self: Insert a tawdry Prussian entry/kama sutra reference, if time allows.]

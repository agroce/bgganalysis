Game is good.  But it's a CCG.  And an expensive one at that.  And that's saying something.  Also it kind of sucks for limited and let's face it, that's one of the best selling points for a CCG.

+ Theme meets cool dice meets interesting and fast-paced gameplay; Even with only the first couple sets out there are a ton of options and plenty of characters to try out.
- The way that the legendaries are so much better than anything else really puts this squarely into the money-pit category competitively.

I really like this Star Wars card and dice game.  It is very quick and easy to set-up, plays fast, very tactical.  There is a lot of strategy and fun to the deck building.

For fun casual play a couple of starter packs and a few boosters is all you need.

It is a CCG though so is expensive to collect every card or make lots of very competitive decks. That said it is quite a bit cheaper than MTG because there is a maximum of just 2 copies of every card in a deck and the decks are smaller just 30 cards so the amount of rare's you might need to build a very competitive deck isn't that many compared with some other CCG's.

However the game really takes off if you want to play more competitively.  The deck building is really interesting with some really cool decks like Vaider/Raider (Darth Vader and Tuscan Raider!)  There is a lot of variety which is changing all the time with the release of expansions. So if you have a regular tournament or league scene in your area its a whole hobby in itself just like X-Wing or Magic The Gathering.

FFG really killed it with this one. It is very simple to teach and understand, but it has lots of interesting decisions and is both exciting and addicting. Deckbuilding is interesting, the characters having their own separate valuation and remaining outside your deck (but constraining the cards that can go INTO the deck) is brilliant, and combined with a 30 card deck limit it makes it actually a fun endeavor rather than something a little more strenuous and time consuming like seen in MTG and even netrunner. There is just enough trickeration to make the game consistently interesting, that combined with the dice (super chunky and satisfying) makes each turn (which all proceed quickly) interesting and fun. The product shortage has added to an already ravenous launch, this one is going to be HUUUGE


HUGE CAVEAT: As with all FFG card games, the base experience (in this case, 2 starters) is vastly inferior to the full experience (i.e. decks built with the full card pool). The degree to which the experience suffers depends on the game, with SW: D the experience is significantly worse. This means you'll likely have to buy some boosters (even 6 or so can make a big difference) or even just buy some characters on the secondary market, because 2 elite characters or 3/4 character teams just give you so many more options and prolong the game as well. I personally don't mind this much, the collectible aspect of the game is enjoyable and is nowhere near as expensive as MTG (though it is significantly more expensive than the LCG model).  People will disparage the game because of this, but it's the business model they've chosen, and smartly, I think.

I really didn't like it. I wanted to, so badly, but I tested it at a demo and just felt that it ultimately wasn't any good... It seems like everyone is hung up on the presentation in one regard or another, I had no issue with the presentation at all, but was so throughly underwhelmed by the design and gameplay that I could never recccomened it. Even for curiosity sake, there are better games to spend time on and with.

Wow. There is a lot more to this game than a quick read of the rules suggests. 
It's weird that the Rey starter box contains illegal cards and dice, but it's probably just a ploy to get you to buy a bunch of boosters. A clever ploy that works!
Once you get a full 30-card deck and 30 points of characters, this game provides an epic duel experience.

RATING: 6
Based on starter sets.

 Game play  - okay. 

    Felt like it was flat and didn't feel the theme in the game play - it was choppy with the many small actions. For a 'battle' game it never felt like such. The game has never provided me with a satisfied feeling while winnings or losing.  From these play throughs I feel like at no point is it worth putting any more money into this game. There are people arguing that the game is better with full (30 card) custom decks - but these are minimum $60 (some people believe that number is over $100 to get. I'd rather spend my money on many other games.

 Components - okay.

    Wasn't impressed with the art work enough to want to collect or even sleeve - compared to GOT LCG and LotR LCG. The dice are good quality, but again the artwork could have been improved.

It's a good card game. Mechanically fine. Not in the same league as M:tG or even Netrunner, but has its own charms. It's also a lot lighter and quicker. Good filler. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The game is good. Adding dice, the ability to manipulate the hell out of them and the alternating moves provide a lot of extra depth that just attack/defense + keyword card games can never provide.

The model is bad. FFG is selling Starters that have too few cards for their own deck standards (20 in pack vs 30 needed) and you need cards to have a specific allegiance/color combination in order to add them to your deck, making the amount of unusable cards per booster unreasonably high.

Star Wars: Destiny has few simple rules, and can be picked up pretty easily by anyone familiar with FFG's living card games (but even by casual players), and has a very fast and furious gameplay. There is a constant back and forth between players, exchanging blows and tricks in a frantic way...
The game has a surprising number of decision points, though: which cards to discard to re-roll dice, when to drop off the turn to claim a Battlefield, the timing and target of attacks...
Of course the naysayers point to the collectible model, but I must say I re-discovered the joy of booster pack opening and blind buy with this game.

Typical collectable card game with dice as combat tokens. Nothing special. The gameplay is actually rather boring. Average game of its genre. I guess the Star Wars License will sell some copies.

RATING: 3.3
This game appeared to have way too much luck for my liking. This is basically my play in a nutshell. I hope to draw good cards... If I did draw good cards, I then hope to roll well... if I did roll well, I then hope my opponent did not draw well and reset/pitch the dice I just rolled to play the cards I drew. I felt a lot like a hampster on a wheel.

Maybe the luck can be midigated by customizing your own deck to really "pwn some n00bz" but that just means you need to toss cash hoping to get the card that will really make you great, which then means if your buddy's aren't spending as much as you they won't want to play with you because it's not a fair fight. Nothing says "great game!" like having player balance issues based directly on how much you spend.

Great gameplay, pretty simple to get into (my wife enjoys it pretty well and she's disinclined toward overly complex games), but of course it's a CCG, so it's going to be a money sink for any but the most self-controlled among us.  Sadly, I am not one of them.  :(  $$$

RATING: 6
A decent game lacking character or even a quirk, Star Wars Destiny is just another Star Wars cash-in made to appeal nerdy gamers and non-gamers alike.

Its generic mechanism is that of an overgrown filler with a pasted-on theme that lasts longer than it should: and, since it requires the purchase of several randomly-assorted boosters to become interesting or even challenging, it leans towards the collectibles side rather than the gamers.

Theme is the biggest letdown for me: Star Wars has long overdue its welcome, if there ever was any.

RATING: 5
Picked up both starter sets and a few boosters. The game is more fun than we thought it would be to play. Certainly nothing ground breaking, but a solid 7 for sure. Surprised at how excited people are about it when the break down of packs/boxes with character distribution isn't great for casual gamers (despite what some will tell you).

Knocking two marks off for the predatory rarity and distribution model leaves this game at a 5 for us. 

The actual distribution method of the game and the rarity model is absolutely not for our group. We like to get complete sets to draft from and to do that we would be getting close to almost AUS$1000 and FFG have just released info about the second set coming out in Q2. Add to that the lack of availability for the first set boosters and this is a hard pass from us. 

I can see why people like CCGs/CDGs, but they aren't for everyone. It is disappointing in this case because the game itself (while not brilliant) looks like it will grow into itself nicely.

If the rarity model and value for packs was better we might consider it, but this game does not use a friendly rarity model or distribution model and is my mind pretty obviously about the cash first, game later. 

Again, just my opinion, no one else had to agree with it. I how everyone that does get into it has fun though. All the best to them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Haven't played it yet, but I'm rating it a 5 because of how expensive it's going to be, knowing FFG.  It likely won't be worth the money and the theme is ... well ... I don't really care for Star Wars.  Therefore, even without having played this game, I rate it a 5 based on the context and what I already know about it.  I think that's fair.

RATING: 4
Almost nothing but luck in this game. The model is nothing but a money grab. The addition of the "Draft" makes that more obvious. To play the draft you are supposed to "open" 6 boosters each time. Every time someone sits down for a "Draft" game FF sells 6 boosters? No thanks.

RATING: 6.5
Good deck-building head-to-head fighting game. Love the theme, top-notch components. Going in I knew what my gripe would be, and it definitely was: the dice. In a typical deck-builder you've got the luck of the shuffle and order the cards come out to keep things interesting. Here, you still have that luck, but then add dice which ca  significantly swing things. More plays and I'd likely bump it another half point or even a full point, but I can't see this every hitting an 8. Still, it was fun.

Well, I was very underwhelmed with this game.  I don't need another Collectible game to get in to, but it's not like the system is even good enough to pull me in to wanting to even buy the minimum to play with my kids.  I love Star Wars: LCG, and Dice Masters, so I feel I have enough of that kind of thing to just enjoy.  The dice are a lot prettier than they seemed in pictures, but this still wasn't enough to suck me in.  A good enough game to play, but not so much that I want to dive in to the cards and build myself a couple of decks...  oh well not everything is for everyone... and this just isn't for me...

I am very conflicted on this game.  I love star wars, FFG makes great quality games, and the gameplay is definitely cool and well thought out.  But for whatever reason, I can't seem to figure out how to win against anyone who has played the game before.  It ruthlessly punishes you if you don't mess with the other player, which is cool, but just maybe not my play style.

Star Wars Destiny is a surprising good dice and card game. The dice are very beautiful (they show a little picture of their card while the card shows abilities and the sides of their die).

You build Your deck (1 to 4 character-cards and their 2-5 dice; 1 location and 30 cards and 10-15 dice). There are enough building options for different decks (damage, mill, ...). When two players play the same decks 5 or 6 times each game feels different (well designed, FFG).

The main disadvantage of this game is, that FFG decided to publish it as a collectible game. If You want to own each card and die 2x (allowed maximum per deck) You have to spend an extremely high amount of money (> 1500 Euro until end of 2017). Most players (including me) can't (and don't want to) spend sooo much money for one game.

Fortunately also in Germany at least one store sells (english) single cards and dice. So I bought two displays and then missing cards and dice I wanted to have. Trading is unfortunately not so easy as most players in my town only own german language cards.

All in all I like SW Destiny but I don't know how often I will buy new displays.

This game is a lot of fun, even though I abhor the "collectible" aspect of it.

In truth, I'd probably really give it a 7 or an 8.  The main reason I gave it a 9 is because this is one of the only games I have that I've been able to get all sorts of non-gamers to play with me.  It's simple and fluid enough that even my family members that normally hate games seemed to really enjoy it.  We got a lot of plays in over the holidays and had a great time, so that's elevated it's rating for me.  If that changes I'll bump it down.

A wonderful competitive card game where you can mix and match characters to join forces to defeat your opponent. Choosing from playing either heroes or villains from the Star Wars universe the game has depth and complexity that rivals other card and dice games of it's kind.

Star Wars: Destiny is always fun to play and being able to be competitive makes it where you can show everyone why you are the best at the game.

Really well done back and forth card and dice game with the star wars theme on high quality components. FFG really knows how to make competitive card games but I hate that they went with the CCG model rather than their tried and true LCG model. This game suffers from all the issues that other CCG games have like distribution problems and rare cards being strong in the meta, albeit at a smaller scale so the pain is maybe bearable for the gameplay.

This came as quite a pleasant surprise to me. I'd read some reviews that seemed to indicate that this didn't have much strategy and was geared towards kids with its simple rules. But it's a remarkably elegant game with more choices than I would've expected. I continue to wonder if it's worthwhile to take shields or instead to discard cards to re-roll...

I love rolling dice, I love card games and I love star wars. I will literally play this game anytime, I just really enjoy it. I've knocked off half a point because I think some cards and combinations just haven't been properly thought through but that's just collectable card games in my experience.

I really want to like Star Wars Destiny.  It seems like a quick to learn, quick set up, 2P card game that could eventually be fairly deep.  Sadly, supply and demand has taken away my interest.  FFG isn't producing enough to keep up, so retailers are usually only selling overpriced singles.  That said, if you have the patience and cash to invest in this, give it a try.  It is pretty solid.

RATING: 8
This game is quite fun! It is definitely too expensive for me to responsibly commit to trying to get all the cards, but I will get enough boosters to at least give me a solid hero and villain deck. Still, with the little bit that I have spent ~$50, I find it to sufficiently fun to justify that amount spent. I have spent more than that on games that I will likely never play as much as SW D. For example, I paid ~$65 for the 2e Robinson Crusoe - I love the game and have played it twice for a total of ~4-5 hours. Realistically, I won't play that again for a month or two even though it is a great game! I have already played ~6 hours SW D and I feel like I am just getting started! Starts to get REALLY fun if you have friends that are getting into it as well.

I find it odd that so many people get this game knowing that it is a CCG and then complain about that very fact in their review... almost as if they are expecting something else. Maybe I'm simple minded, but I can't help but liken it to a person who dislikes word games going out to buy scrabble and consequently leaving a crap review because, SURPRISE, it's a word game.

Captain Phasma and Count Dooku battle Han Solo and Luke Skywalker in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. Jango Fett and Jabba the Hutt attack Rey and Finn as they pass through the frozen wastes of Starkiller Base. Play out your own epic, saga-spanning, “what if” battles in Star Wars™: Destiny, a collectible dice and card game for two players!

In every game of Star Wars: Destiny, you’ll gather your small team of iconic characters and battle to defeat your foes, using your dice and the cards in your deck. The last player with characters left standing wins the game, but to successfully outmaneuver your opponent, you’ll need to carefully consider your options and enhance your deck with new dice and cards. If you ever wondered who would win a duel between two teams of heroes and villains from the Star Wars universe, there’s no better way to find out than with Star Wars: Destiny.

Own both starter decks. Unable to find reasonably priced product, but this game is great! Fantastic gameplay with the ability to mitigate the luck-factor with dice for more consistent strategies with tons of options in play.

RATING: 7
Yeah ok I'll admit it... I like this one, 

I really didn't want because its collectable, and a dicemasters clone and star wars and....and .... but actually its a fairly simple enjoyable 20 minute dice rolling filler with just enough tactical depth. 

I like the back and for- I take an action you take an action -, there is no reaction to each others actions like in magic. I can see everything you have in play and I must react accordingly just as you can see what I have.  

Once a character is activated and dice are rolled into play, the opponent has first chance to play with the dice, allowing them to react to the big hit that is coming before you are able to wield it. It sort of feels a bit worker placement like as the dice are resolved one or two at a time to inflict damage, use special abilities or otherwise manipulate the game state. The cards themselves add all sorts of ways to disrupt your opponent's plans, which does a nice job of making it feel like an interactive duel.

 I also really like the mechanic whereby +1 resource on its own does nothing as you have nothing to add it to, so this gives a tactical level of play because if I remove your 1 attack , i can effectively nullify your +1 attack dice as well, this is quite novel in terms of gameplay and I have not seen it in any other games

I like that there is a discard a card to reroll any/all dice mechanic as this prevents bad rolls forcing a null turn, and cards are replaced at the start of each turn. solid mechanics and they seem to work well.

Dice are chunky and very well printed, making them clear and easy to read (unlike the first edition of quarriors dice). Overall fun fast filler that doesn't feel like you have to massively customise the deck before you can play.... both starter deck seem fairly well matched against one another

A 2 player head-to-head card and dice game. The rules of the game are really simple and it is a breeze to explain. The gameplay is smooth and the cards are interesting.

I'm usually not a big fan of this type of game, but this one is an exception. Partly because of the theme but mostly because it just plays smooth and fast and yet there are a lot of interesting tactical decisions each play.

RATING: 8
A great player vs player game. Fast paced, fun with a touch of luck typical for dice games. Subtle dice control, a variety of options for (later) deckbuilding, decent card graphics and Star Wars setting oozing from the box seconds after opening it, are the main features that contribute to my score. It great for kid vs kid, parent vs parent, brothers, sisters and all the variations. Easy to learn, especially for those deeply rooted in searching for synergies, combos, etc... On the other hand, there's the money issue, it's expensive, given the fact you'll need couple of dozens of boosters (for competitive play even more). And even more, if you want to keep the game alive after few months - new, additional cards will be introduced every 4 months (a guess?)

This is my first Competitive CCG and I absolutely love the Art (yes Dan, the art) on the cards and the chunky dice. Add in some "luck" of the draw and dice rolls can help pull out a victory from nowhere.  Ultimately, you have to be able to construct a deck that makes sense, stick to your strategy, and take your time on making your decisions.

I'm not thrilled with FFG's marketing and fulfillment but just based upon game play its taken up most of my game time. As close to perfection a game can get for me.

I managed to finally snag a couple starter boxes and tried this one out. I was impressed. It was fun despite the starters being imbalanced as determined by FFG's own point based construction system. Then I started looking into getting more and realized how FFG is doing the CCG model in the worst way possible.

Unlike Dice Masters where you have legendary cards, but the dice are all common, here the dice are the same rarity as the cards. Given the deck construction rules, this means that you need two of most legendary rarity cards to make full use of them.

Well, at least the legendary cards aren't the best cards in the game then, right? Wrong. Checking out tournament winning decks online they all include multiple legendary cards. Putting together one of these decks by buying singles would cost at least $200! I have yet to see any competitive decks that don't include multiple legendary cards.

At least I can play casually, right? Well, the starter decks aren't full decks. Each is 10 cards shy of upgrade/event/support cards and 5 to 10 points short of character cards. That means if you're trying to put together two casual decks it's going to be a minimum of five booster packs before you even have the raw numbers you need to fill out the decks. Add in faction and color dependencies and you'll probably need more, especially for the Rey/Finn starter deck.

That brings us to the distribution problems that are still plaguing this game as I write this. The initial release is impossible to find at this point, and Spirit of Rebellion boosters aren't much easier to locate. They're doing one reprint of the initial run and that's it. 

The end result? A game with good mechanics that can be fun to play, but a distribution model that results in just another 'pay to win' game at the competitive level, and no clear path to affordable casual play.

Pro:
- the quick I-take-an-action-you-take-an-action structure is really cool compared to more traditional long turns in other CCG's.
- game is short enough.  Not overly long like most other CCG's.
- combat is simple, but interesting.

Con:
- You need characters dice to build decks, and they're not present in boosters enough to have a healthy diversity.  Sure, you could buy $150 worth of stuff, and/or buy-sell singles, but that barrier to entry is way to high for the majority of customers.
- Dice are too large to roll properly, and ugly.

Got to counter the haters!

UPDATE: I want to maintain the 10 due to people giving negative score just because it is a CCG. The game itself is amazing, and being a CCG doesn't mean you can't play it casually and without spending your wallet! People need to step up, be smart and quit winning, there are many ways to enjoy this game. Now, i will NOT even star on the ones that dissed the game out just because after 4 games they lost badly and want to blame it purly on the rolls...I would say, most of those people are pretty bad at playing the game anyways, or just don't get it. I do have a personal friend like that, so i know exactly their thoughts.

RATING: 7
I love Star Wars, so most Star Wars games with any kind of decent mechanics are appealing to me. I also enjoy dice-rolling and these big chunky dice are great on a tactile level. That said, some of the thrill of rolling dice comes from knowing what you really need, rolling, and seeing if you got it or not. The dice in this game are more of a random resource, so they are used more to direct your turn on a tactical level than to resolve a challenge in a thrilling fashion. 

I do enjoy the back-and-forth tension that taking a single action each turn provides. You need to do things before your opponent does them, but there are so many things you need to do! It almost has a worker-placement feel for that reason. And when you finally end your turn, if you end before your opponent, you get to go first next time in addition to another benefit, so it can definitely be correct to forgo some of the more minor things you could do in order to go first the next time. 

My big concern with this game is whether or not it can find an audience. That sounds silly to say given the property on which it is based, but from a mechanical standpoint, it's really pretty niche. You've got the collectible aspect as well as the dizzying array of keywords and symbols that seem to really put this into the tournament-only crowd. On the other hand, the randomness that occurs from both rolling lots of dice each turn as well as drawing from a random deck makes me worry that it will be too swingy to be taken seriously by the tournament crowd.

1. Rey, Hera and a Rebel Trooper defeat ???General Grievous and a Nightsister.
2. Asajj Ventress and Kylo defeat the Emperor with a couple of mind probes (for 9), a lightsaber throw, and light melee damage.
3. Asajj Ventress and Kylo defeat Hera, Temmin, and General Rieekan. Rieekan went down first, then Hera as the rebel ships arrived which took out Kylo. Too much damage on Temmin by then for the Y-Wings and U-Wing to finish the job.
4. Hera, Ezra and Jedi Instructor defeat Asajj and Kylo. Ezra went down first, didn't get to steal any resources but did use Diplomatic Protection to buff his friends. Still had the resources to get several ships into play. Should probably drop Jedi Instructor for Jedha Partisan, and remove BB-8 and Meditate for Second Chance and Bolt Hole or maybe Quadjumper.

This is a great fun game that doesn't take too long to play. For ages now I've been looking for shorter games that fill the more common time frame we have available which is between half an hour to an hour. Star Wars Destiny does this perfectly with unique mechanics that make for an original game while still being fun and intuitive. It is a little more complicated than Dice Masters with a few more rules to pick up, and this meant my wife didn't instantly love it. But she didn't hate either, so I think she'll come around. I also really li,e that you can play multiplayer.

I feel like the FLGS where I bought the starters should have told us we would never get the chance to upgrade our decks. My daughter loves it but I guess we'll keep playing the starters a few more times and maybe give it to someone else. No point in waiting for boosters that will never come.

If you are hard core into it, it well be an expensive game to get what you need....but If you playing for fun you can get most the cards you need to custimize by buying cards as singles.....There are many good cards that are not the hard to get(EXPENSIVE!).  I do think if you buy packs its really hard to get the character combos you need to make your own deck unless you pay a lot of money.

Nice, quickie one for winter evenings.  One thing that core set becomes  quite boring very fast, after only a few games. But there are boosters, and 3 sets per year intended, so really huge amount of money is needed to sustain game enjoyable, If one's okay with that, then should enjoy the game.

Also, it's very difficult to evenly boost the decks from boosters, so casual gaming could become uneven very quick. But that's not problem if there is someone to exchange card with.

Probably the best LCG style of game FFG has produced.

Kylo ren and Rey starter packs

RATING: 3
Bought the starter set to play with a friend, and just did not enjoy it. I'm a huge star wars fan and really WANTED to like this game, but a few things really bothered me.

1 - I felt the dice rolling did not leave me with any feeling of satisfaction at all. I totally understand the dice are not just for attacks and can be played for other things, however I felt like the results of the dice totally underwhelming.

2 - Going along with the first, there were very few chances to modify your dice rolls, and those that there were, were so specific it made them almost useless in most situations. For example one card allowed you for 2 resource to reroll any - you rolled. Now if you didnt roll any - than that card is useless. Another card allowed you for 2 resources to re-roll a die and if you roll a - you do 2 unblockable damage. So for 2 resource it gives you a re-roll and a 1 in 6 chance of doing 2 unblockable damage...that seems like a terrible trade off to me.

3 - The way the dice % on the characters are set up was just strange. For example Kylo had a 1 in 6 chance of doing assured damage to the opponent. He had 2 out of 6 damage rolls, but 1 cost a resource to do 2 damage. Then his special ability was to randomly take a card from opponent and do damage based on cost, if cost was 0 then 0 damage. so in essence a 1 in 6 chance of doing damage, which I found to be very strange and really took me out of the game (and that was with using both his dice, lightsaber die And his force upgrace ability card).

This isn't so much a game problem as a fantasy flight issue so I'm not holding this against the game but think it's worth mentioning. The game is meant to be played with a deck of 30 cards, FF only supplies you with 20. Now if you're going to sell a starter pack with the intention of getting people to WANT to buy more of your game, why would you not give them enough cards to at least play the game properly once?

As star wars games go, I'd much rather play rebellion and even star wars risk over this, unfortunately this did nothing for me, I'm sure others will enjoy it. This just did not leave me with a satisfying feeling during or after playing it, which was really disappointing.

RATING: 4
This is definitely not my type of game.  From the collectability, to the theme; from the deck constructing, to the nature of the gameplay; all of these things combined make for a game that I would only consider playing out of duty to a friend.

Although it's centered in the Star Wars universe, the gameplay doesn't feel richly connected to that theme.  The dice are high quality; nice and big and chunky but since they're big and chunky they don't allow for what feels like a satisfying roll.

Hát ez elkapott... nem is tudom, utoljára mikor voltam ennyire izgatott egy játék miatt. Gyors, pörgős kis ide-oda csata, amelyben van mélység. Nyilván jelentős a szerencse szerepe, hiszen kocka- illetve kártyajátékról beszélünk, de egyáltalán nem a véletlen dönti el a végeredményt. A hangulata kiváló, és tudom, hogy furcsa, de a gyűjtögető jellege kimondottan izgalmas még így 2016-ban is. Az agyam tudja, hogy pénztemető, de közben mégis olyan izgatottan bontogatom a boostereket... ehh...:D

1 partida.

He jugado con el básico de los buenos contra el básico de los malos. Es un juego de cartas 1vs1 al estilo del famoso Magic o del Hearthstone, que añade la mecánica de los dados.

La partida me gustó, emocionante hasta el final y para nada complicado. Pero este tipo de juegos los penalizo mucho porque suponen un dinaral inmeso el tener que ir comprando sobres para poder hacer tu mazo más fuerte y tal. Además, debes tener gente que esté dispuesta a gastarse similar cantidad de pasta para poder jugar con ellos.

I've played like 4-5 games of it now with different cards and heros each time and almost every single one of the games started with me losing a hero turn two from amazing dice rolls. If a game can swing that badly on dice rolls I want nothing to do with it. This is a solid no for me.

Demoed multiple times at gencon; including a full game (which they were letting some people do at first).  The game is just fun, it's both a card game and a dice game, and both are very important to how it plays.  The dice generate as many decisions as the cards.  I highly recommend giving it a try.

This CCG has some pros and cons. To start with cons, the card design is terrible (not artwork, but design - frames etc), FFG has issues with balance testing and the supply of product was first year also miserable. Also the tournament prizes are cheap. However the game itself is fast, variable, joyful. Whole game is heavily built around mitigation and manipulation of dices you throw, so it is not luck based almost at all. Really nice concept, but it could be done better.

Kylo & Rey & Booster Pack - Glalakta Polish edition
Pojedynki postaci znanych z całego uniwersum Gwiezdnych Wojen. Karty i kości bardzo sprytnie połączone. Karty umożliwiają wprowadzanie nowych kości (pomocników, umiejętności, wydarzeń) jak również dają specjalne zdolności by zmieniać wynik na kościach u siebie i przeciwnika. Karty mogą również umożliwiać zadawanie obrażeń, leczenie, sprawiać że gracz może zaatakować kilka razy, ponownie użyć swoich umiejętności (mimo ich użycia w danej rundzie), zrobić coś specjalnego gdy przeciwnik coś zrobi itp. Na ściankach kości występują następujące symbole:  atak wręcz, atak dystansowy (oba rodzaje ataku zadają obrażenia ale niektóre umiejętności z kart mogą odnosić się do jednego z nich (np blokować obrażenia dystansowe lub dawać jakąś premię temu kto oberwie od miecza;)), osłony, zasoby (czyli walutę w grze za którą można wystawiać do gry nowe karty), mogą usuwać karty przeciwnika (przeciwnik przegrywa gdy nie ma w talii i na ręce żadnych kart), usuwać zasoby przeciwnika oraz znak umiejętności specjalnej (tylko wtedy można jej użyć gdy wypadnie na kości taki znak). Wygrywa ten kto usunie wszystkie postacie przeciwnika z gry (zada im tyle obrażeń ile mają wytrzymałości) lub przeciwnikowi zabraknie kart do zagrania. Drugim bardzo istotnym aspektem tego typu gry jest składanie talii czyli jakimi postaciami i jakimi pomocniczymi kartami będzie podchodzić do pojedynku. Karty muszą być dobrane do umiejętności postaci by się uzupełniać oraz wzajemnie wzmacniać. Nie wszystkie interakcje są dozwolone (jednak niektóre karty pozwalają zignorować zakazy) pewne karty są nie przydatne danej postaci a inne mogą być niezbędne. Paradoksalnie dużo zabawy jest bez grania w samą grę - to jest właśnie tajemnica popularności tego typu karcianek kolekcjonerskich (CCG) lub niekolekcjonerskich (LCG) kombinowanie jak połączyć karty by tworzyły możliwie najmocniejszą synergię. Cena powala, jeżeli chciało by się mieć wszystkie karty i to w minimum x2 (bo można mieć max 2szt w talii) to 750zł nie starczy na pewno(za jeden zestaw, obecnie już są dwa więc kwota się podwaja). Na szczęście nie trzeba mieć wszystkich a powszechne i częste można tanio kupić, za cały komplet około 50zł (powszechne i częste są bez kości, tańsze z kościami to 2-5zł, droższe od 5-30 a najdroższe zwykle legendarne nawet do 120zł/szt). Za jakiś czas zapewne Galakta przestanie drukowywać wersję pl i będzie dostępna wyłącznie ang i wtedy pewnie bardzo tanio będzie można dokupić brakujące :)

RATING: 9
Dynamic game that typically plays fast and aims to simulate a fighting game like street fighter.  The designer's goal was to allow for a dynamic of action vs reaction with the ability for combo chaining (known as action-cheating) to simulate the concept of combo moves in a fighting video game.  Star Wars theme is a plus (personal preference) and the act of rolling dice at the table is fun.  With many re-roll mechanics and dice face changing options, the game does not feel like "luck" plays a huge role in the outcome of most games.

Deck building is intuitive and streamlined due to the small 30 size but there seems to be a large variety in options, play styles, and the current Meta reflects this.

A major disappointment. Played this game twice with Bun (aka ammms in BGG) after a 6 month hiatus from playing boardgames, and I just wish that I could have played others instead of this one. The game is way too random, and the modifiers/ reroll mechanism still depends so much on luck rather than actual skill. I just didn't get the point while some others argue that the luck in dice rolling is similar to the luck in card draw. At least I could have tutor cards for me to specifically find the card I want!

First play was fun and I loved the action system and the rules seemed clean and interesting. The first expansions, however, allowed for rule subversion and loopholes that make the game tiresome. Some characters are also very clearly overly powerful while others painfully useless. Seemed like a game with a lot of potential that falls quite short.

Star Wars: Destiny is a good, simple and fast game. turns go back and forth very quickly. a match can be played in roughly 20 min, which is nice. the cards and dice look fantastic and they are of good quality, too.

however, I plan to stay away from this one, for two reasons:
1) the game is, like I said, a simple one. it does not offer the same level of tactical depth as Mage Wars for instance. most of the options on your turn are rather obvious.
2) it is a CCG. you will end up spending way more money on this game than it actually deserves.

in conclusion, I don't think a simple game like this is worth the money it will end up costing.

I like the game play.  This is an interesting take on the CCG genre.  The dice add an interesting twist.  I would like to give the game more stars, but unfortunately this game is really hard to acquire (at least, where I live).  I was lucky to find the starter decks and I have not seen them since.  FFG has a good product, but it sounds like it is made in too limited of a production.  If I could get my hands on boosters/starters more easily, I would definitely play this more and rate it higher.

I've been playing card games for more than 20 years.  This game has an incredible balance of healthy variance (cards you draw, dice you roll) and choices that affect the outcome of the games.  The shared turn structure makes this feel a lot more like tennis or speed chess, and less like the solitaire feeling that many people attribute to card games.  It's complex enough to be deep, but no so complex that I'd hesitate to teach an interested 8 year old.  I highly recommend this game.

I really liked this at first. As I've played it more, the card draw and dice rolls have become a bit too swingy for my tastes. You might get nothing useful, while your opponent takes out one of your characters very quickly. Granted, deck construction helps to mitigate this, but it does seem to be an inherent flaw of the game. I think that with some refinement, this game could become an awesome system. Especially since the combat is obviously borrowed from Runebound 3rd Edition, except that you use dice instead of the pogs.

I don't like to "start down the path" of "collectible" games.  This one is decently fun and does a decent job of mitigating poor die rolls, by having several mechanisms for changing, re-rolling, etc.  My sister owns it and I will definitely play it with my nephew, but I don't see me purchasing it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Love the theme.  Love the dice.  In the end, I think it ends up as an expensive filler.  If compared to other FFG living card games, the game play falls short.  I was optimistic that a broader range of actions to choose from between alternating player pulses would generate a range of difficult decisions, but in practice the decisions are predominantly obvious.  This leaves the result of the game in the hands of the dice, card draws, and of course, the deck building.  The problem with relying on deck building as the primary source of player differentiation is that it can shift balance in favor of those with deeper pockets.  It also, in this case, shifts the depth of player decisions to before the game begins rather than during the game.  Dicemasters, in comparison, provides both in game deck (actually dice) building decision making, push your luck "Yahtzee" re-roll decisions, and attack or defend "Magic" decisions.  In practice, Destiny can create the joy of rolling a great combo, but the game does seem to devolve into waiting for some one to roll that combo and giving the opponent one turn to break it up.  It can drag a bit waiting for the combos to emerge.  Finally, other similar games have a narrative where the more powerful fighters appear later in the game, leading to an increase in power over time.  Destiny begins with the most powerful fighters already in play.  You can supplement them with equipment, but you will not be bringing out a new fighter that holds a candle to the starting group.

This is a potential MtG killer for me.  I have played MtG on and off for two decades and really enjoy it, but the steep learning and financial curve has dissuaded folks I know from getting into it.  And, since my favorite part is coming up with creative and powerful decks, it hurts to have to pull back to stay competitive.  With Star Wars Destiny, it reboots everything as I am learning the game with them so we are growing together.  Add in the awesome dice and the relatively simple gameplay, removing 20 years of added mechanisms, and you have a ground floor CCG that has legs for us.

Decent illustrations: No photos, like you'd expect from a licensed property. Instead, everything is drawn and the illustrations seem to be divided equally among all movies. However, graphic design is a bit strange: for example, three different things are color-coded, and with overlapping colors. Also, set numbers are hard to read.

Component quality was a positive surprise but the card size is baffling: The cards are 1 mm narrower than standard size. Why would anyone make a collectible game where the cards are neither [i]MtG[/i] nor [i]Yu-Gi-Oh![/i] size? 

The full online rulebook is probably the clearest and most comprehensive FFG has ever produced (even though I did have some trouble finding the definition of "same card") but the game still generates quite a bit of rules questions because of imprecise wording on cards.

Absolutely outrageous rarity distribution, definitely not for completionists. Single non-legendary cards seem to be readily and affordably available at retailers, though.

Has quite a few cards with clunky and antiquated mechanics like ”choose a color and try to draw that from an opponent’s hand” but luckily a vast majority of cards are designed better than that.

Playing is believing. This game is incredible possibly the best or one of the best games I've ever played. I wasn't interested in this game even after watching a play through just seemed to ok... a friend roped me into a pre-release event and I have not played another game since... definitely check this one out.

RATING: 9
Awesome Star Wars duelling game! Very fast paced and thematic game with superb artwork and nice chunky dice. I thought upon seeing this game that it might be too light for my interest, but actually the strategic depth is there and it offers rich gameplay and deck construction challenges. Since it has collectible model, it´s quite expensive to get a variety of characters and cards to build decks from but it´s all worth it. No other LCG or CCG has gotten my attention that much so far, but I am really hooked on this one - Its my favourite theme and even better game than Star Wars LCG. And the collectible model makes it actually more exciting to aquire cards for and build decks. So far I am playing it casually only - we dont have any organized play of SW Destiny in Estonia, at least not yet. The plus side of this is that I am not required to build Tournament quality decks and can get away with less.

I own:
* Rey Starter Set
* Kylo Ren Starter Set
* 1 Awakenings booster box
* 1 Spirit of Rebellion booster box + 7 extra booster packs from SoR
* 2 Empire at War booster boxes + 12 extra booster packs from EaW
* a lot of extra singles from Awk and Sor (a 1,7 box worth I guess - but I could pick what I want).

I have had terrible luck with loose boosters - I have bought a total of 21 loose booster packs and got only one legendary (cheap one - Baze) so I am wondering - should I stop this nonsense or continue and allow the luck even out? At least my 6 legendaries per each sealed box have been quite good.

My first CCG. 

Each set and various metas are bound to produce different opinions from me, but on the whole, I love the concept, structure, pace, look/feel, variety of strategies, ability to experiment, and theme of this game. Also- it's wonderful to be a part of a local community surrounding it!

Only complaint is it's a money sink. (Similar to Magic the Gathering) The game is fun and very thematic. It's easier to play and easier to transport than X-Wing / Armada / Imperial Assault. Best FFG to teach to non-gamers and takes the least amount of time.

Just bad. 

I could see this having potential, but you'd need to spend 100s of $$$ to get to that stage. 

The game takes too long to play for what it is. Very random and light, but I guess that's to be expected from a dice game. But there just aren't very interesting decisions to be made when playing it....

This is an interesting concept with a CGG with Dice. The dice rolling seems to put even more chaos into the battle.  I'm not sure why the hype on this game it was just okay for me.  I think I'm in the minority as I these skirmish type games aren't my cup of tea.  It was just okay for me.  The hero side is much more powerful than the villain side.  Rey should only use one die to even the odd with just starter decks but the hero side is still a little easier.

First of all, I absolutely don't like the fact that you could mix characters from various episodes (ex.  a match between characters from episode 1 and episode 7 ). 
Second, every round is dictated by the dice rolls, and how many times you discard cards in order to reroll them, often making your turn an entire run at discarding cards to obtain the dice result you wanted. Too random really. During a match, i could kill my opponent last character but didn't get the dice result in order to do it. I had to discard and reroll cards 4 times (four actions!) in order to do it. Nonsense.

I can't deny it any longer. This game is a 10. It's given me the feeling I've been looking for since I started gaming. The feeling that I just want to become completely engrossed in a game and not care about any other. This has happened here. It's all I want to play. The blind-boosters are extremely exciting and fun for me. The deckbuilding is almost the best part of the game, and then the gameplay is fast, tense and exciting. It feels thematic in a way I didn't think was possible. I'm nerding out to this so hardcore, and am 100% completely infatuated. For now, it's a 10. This game is all I think about.

I found the game largely lacking in meaningful decisions. Lots of micro-decisions that add up to a damage here or a shield there, but no feel for the grandeur or character of the saga.

RATING: 9
This game is so good. Limiting the players to a single action at a time eliminates setting up the killer combo that is found in a lot of customizable games. This structure also makes for extremely interesting decisions as the order that actions are taken can be very important and can be changed to react to or counteract the opponent. I also love the use of the Star Wars theme. This plays like a card version of Star Wars: Epic Duels. It is fun to have Han Solo fly Padme around in the Millennium Falcon or have Kylo Ren be the Sith apprentice of Darth Vader.

I was doubtful of the collectible nature, but feel in love with the art, the feel of the dice and the mechanics. As in every collectible game, there will be hard to beat combos and there will be countercards in upcoming cycles. I don't know if I will want to spend the money to play this competently, but it surely will be a fun game casually. The question is, if I can learn to be happy knowing I will not own everything. If yes, then this would be cheaper than an LCG.

I played four full starter set games at Essen. The dice can be cruel especially when you make your rolls worse with every reroll you take and even improve the opponent's combo that you wished to destroy by rolling his dice again. Anyway, even that game felt good in the end. And I feel, there are so many new options, combos and possibilities, one you move beyond the starter.

Early days of play (Xmas '16 gift), but easy to pick up and a lot of fun. Scored on the strength of a starter Kylo Ren vs a starter Rey set. Whether the collectible side of things will affect the scores, I can't be sure for now. What was there certainly seemed to capture the spirit of the films nicely and gave us a lot of exciting moments.

RATING: 6
If this were an LCG and there was tight control on OP cards, it would probably be very good. The core mechanisms and product quality are solid. The 'pay-to-win' aspect is a major disappointment, and the set rotation seems too aggressive to me. Thankfully there are fixed sets and perhaps I could see picking some of those up if they can help build acceptably competitive decks with some inexpensive singles.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Theme is pasted on, could literally be anything and wouldn't change the game at all. The game itself is decent, so long as you understand how random it is. Even with a 30 card deck, allowing for no more than 2 copies of any card exacerbates the problem of never drawing what you want. 

The "fast-paced duel" the game advertises just means they've limited players to a single action each turn. Sure makes the game quick, there's no down time, but it also makes it feel as though you're not really making any strategic decisions. Literally one of the actions you take on your turn is to roll dice. Have you rolled what you need? If yes, do that. If no, well, you're basically screwed. This game can absolutely be won or lost based on a roll of the dice. And FF wants it to be competitive?

I may have rated the game a 4 but the way it's being sold is so anti-consumer I won't support it. Each booster pack comes with 6 random cards and 1 die. Those dice are necessary. Without spending exorbitant sums of money you can end up with cards you'd love to play, but not enough dice with which to play them. Completely asinine.

Then the "super-rare" cards, the ones everyone wants, and are objectively better, are limited to 6 per booster box. So unless you're buying these things in bulk, or purchasing singles, it's a bigger gamble than any other CCG.

The buy-in cost of this game is too high, unless you plan on sticking with just the starter sets. Fantasy Flight is better than this. They've proven as much with their LCG format games. This is the worst cash grab of a game I've seen in a long time.

Everything I want from a CCG, Fantasy Flight has done a wonderful job! Decks consist of two character cards and 30 events (spells), supports, or equipment upgrades for your two characters. Your characters will have a color, either Red, Yellow, or Blue, which determines what color cards you can have in your deck. Pretty intuitive.

The art is done quite well, the theme comes through super strong. Feels good deploying some droid commandos to blast my opponent, or using Poe to combo with Rey.

Resource tokens (aka mana) are gained every turn, really streamlines the game and prevents mana screw/flood. The dice rolling mechanic is actually quite nice, as there are ample opportunities to re-roll or even choose a specific side of a die or dice you want to use.

RATING: 8
Early impressions: played three times now and I'm starting to see that this is a good game. The starter decks can be really swingy, and I wouldn't play without using two dice per character (just proxy them with a D6). Once you get through that rough start, there can be some tense games.

The swinginess: you've got both cards and dice. It can happen that someone just rolls badly and doesn't get the right cards at the right time. I imagine this won't be as bad once you start putting together your own decks and characters, but it can be discouraging.

Beyond that, when both players are getting good dice rolls and card draws, the game really starts to shine. At that point it becomes all about timing. When to play a card, when to activate your dice, when to reroll, these actions all become crucial because you just do one action at a time. It feels like a nicely streamlined LCG where every action is potentially huge.

The games can take from ten minutes up to about twenty minutes. This is great for those games where the luck isn't on your side because at least it's over quickly.

Overall it's good. Not sure if it will be a keeper, but I'll at least get a few more cards to try out some different deck types.

Destiny plays differently than any card game I've ever played.

I was wary of the randomness chucking dice would bring to the table, but there are many ways to mitigate your luck and throw a wrench in your opponent's good rolls. It feels like there's a good amount of game here but the rounds should still play quickly.

The CCG aspect of the game kills it for me, however, as I'm unwilling to dive into a cash pit like that.

RATING: 6
[thing=205359][/thing] is a game with strong positives: it has several decision points (both in the use of dice and cards), loads of timming concerns to make the best use of the available resources and to use opportunities, and a huge asymmetry and customization possibilities. Yet, it is collectable. This kills any chance it could had with me. For the negatives, besides the model, there is, of course, luck present, in the roll of the dice and the draw of cards; yet, there are several cards and faces of dice that allow the player to have control of the result one or more of the dice, reducing the overall impact of randomness.

I felt little in terms of theme - I'm not a SW fan, but I do know quite a bit about the lore. The dice are chunky and nice to roll; and the illustrations are well done.

In the end, [thing=205359][/thing] is quite good, but not enough to make the want to enter this arena. I would play it when the chance arise, using dice and decks provide by others.

I've got two starter sets because they were both on sale recently. 

I'm really not a fan of the "collectible" business model. It seems that it's designed to prey on the weak-willed (like myself). Buying packs without knowing the contents just seems like a form of gambling whilst buying individual cards from resellers is basically pay-to-win: Neither option is appealing.

Luckily for my wallet the game is rather unimpressive. Not terrible, just ok. I can't see what it has to do with Star Wars either. Just roll some dice, allocate them in different ways and activate/purchase some cards to change things a bit and perhaps add some extra dice. I think Ashes Rise of the Phoenixborn is a much, much better game. The added bonus is that it also follows a more ethical business model.

Excellent game (from someone who doesn't like the CCG model). Own every card x 2. Kids love it too. Highly recommed. Great community forming as well, with heaps of content.

Just plain TERRIBLE collectable logic: starter decks aren't complete, that forces you to get extra boosters just to reach the minimum of cards required to play; plus 1st edition came with really short print waves, which caused secondary market to reach grotesque valutation over a game that had no OP at all.

I've only played with the starter sets, but so far I like what I see. Game play is a mix of dice rolling and TCG style card play. In fact, the way the dice are resolved almost feels like a worker placement game, as you fire them off one or two at a time to collect resources, inflict damage or otherwise manipulate the board state. Borrowing again from the TCG side of its heritage, the game is filled with all sorts of ways to disrupt your opponent's plans, which does a nice job of making it feel like an interactive duel.

The closest comparisons are going to be between this and dicemasters. While both games certainly cover some of the same ground, Destiny tends to move more slow and deliberately, giving both players time to set up their defenses and respond to their opponent. It does not have the swinginess and explosive turns often found in the games of the dicemasters line. Which may or may not be a positive, depending on your point of view. For me, it's an improvement but as they say YMMV.

I only saw one issue with the game. The dice are incredibly detailed, with full painted images on the faces. They look amazing, but while playing it can become difficult to tell the different dice types apart. Character dice have characters on them obviously, but the items and force abilities aren't always so identifiable. This is because they tend to show the character holding the weapon, or the character channeling the Force, so these other die types are easily mistaken for the character dice. This is important mostly for card effects, which often target only one type of dice.

But I'm sure that will work itself out with experience. I'll come back and update this post-release when I have seen more of the die/card pool, but for now, this game is looking quite good.

It's Ashes with the most popular IP of all time, better/simpler rules, and a CCG business model. Time (and future releases) will tell whether or not it stays solid but I can recommend it unreservedly in its current state.

Yes. This game is awesome! Probably influenced a bit just because its theme, but I think its a pretty revolutionary TCG with its dice system. Harder to carry around than most ccgs, but definitely my top to play. I love how quickly the turns go, and how versatile each card is. Theres not enough randomness in the game to be unfair. Great game, and will always suggesst a game.

*Update* I still enjoy this game, but I have to take a point off because of the amount of time and money involved in keeping up with the constant releases of new cards.

Great game of back-and-forth battling. I love the depth of the deck construction as well as simplicity of play.

I'm not in the market for a two player game, but if I was, this is pretty excellent. I'm not a huge fan of collectability, but the game play is nice and snappy and the decisions are tough while allowing new players to do relatively well.

I really try to avoid CCG/CDGs. However, there was a local event and my primary gaming partner really enjoyed it at BGG.con so I thought I'd pick up a starter pack and stop by for a few hours of gaming.

This game definitely reminds me of why I avoid CCG/CDGs. The starters don't offer any meaningful way of customization and you need one of each (Kylo, Rey) to play against each other. I picked up both starters and four boosters ($50 or so with tax). I lucked out with a few super rares but still am not sure I can make any kind of meaningful customization as I just have the four base characters. The starters themselves don't seem incredibly well balanced as a few good rolls will pick off the low health Stormtrooper early on.

The CCG/CDG aspect aside, the game itself is above average but made significantly better by nice artwork, great components (the dice are notable better than something like Quarriors/Dicemasters), and source material. The gameplay is interesting. Decisions can be straightforward depending on how you roll but there can be some interesting decisions around when to roll and how long to play vs grabbing the "Claim" bonus of a battlefield. I originally thought the game could drag on a little when an outcome was certain but the dice (and certain cards) definitely can give you a puncher's change to pull off a win. 

I'm torn - I enjoyed it but it's hard to make a positive CBA comparison against a more traditional game (or more realistically, 2-3 games for the price of a small customizable Destiny collection). 

Final rating balances the nice artwork/source material against the collectible nature. If you don't mind getting into a CCG/CDG, this is definitely one I would consider.

Fun game, needs dedicated group and priority to get the most. Mechanics and deck building is really cool although the core alone is a little limited in that aspect (corrected by expansions?).

My sole complaint with this game is the dice -- they look like they were manufactured by Fisher Price instead of belonging in a CCG. However, the gameplay is EXCELLENT and after playing, I understand WHY the dice look like they do. There are endless combinations of cards after only a couple releases, which makes deckbuilding quite interesting. Even the best decks can lose from time to time due to the random nature shuffling a deck, drawing up to your hand limit, and rolling the corresponding dice. In a game like this, that's a good thing.

Pretty good head to head card game with dice for randomly allocating resources and abilities. I could see it getting more interesting with deck building but when I only have one opponent these kind of games don't last long - we already have enough options in our collection to fill this niche.

My rating may rise, and [i]I expect that it might.[/i]
SW: Destiny is fast, fun, tactical, and engrossing. Simple rules, and well-designed cards are a bonus and aid to getting this to the table - anyone can get playing in, literally, minutes.

I enjoy the hand management side of the game, and the fact that the designers have included MANY ways to refresh or change your hand, to mitigate bad draws.
One of the terrific fulcrums of this game (and most other dice games), is that even if you have killer cards in play, you are still at the mercy of the dice. But unlike most other dice games, players have a myriad methods of manipulating the bones to your advantage.

One thing I think you might enjoy - I know I do - is the turn structure. It's a super-quick action system, that makes you feel involved through all aspects of both player's turns. AND, possibly my favourite truth about the game: there are no interrupts. You [i][b]always[/b][/i] have an action to respond, and I believe that's rare in a game of this kind. In addition, the type of dice game I favour strongest (these days) is one like SW: Destiny, whereby you roll the dice into a 'decision pool' AND THEN decide on your actions - traditionally, games play out with players choosing an action and then rolling dice to see if they succeed. This game bucks that groupthink. It's a modern design.

The thematic tethering to the Star Wars mythology is first rate. Take, for example, the dark jedi power 'Immoblize' card - it freezes an enemy die, just like Kylo Ren 'pausing' Poe's blasterfire in mid-air. All the dice-based cards fit the universe, and, so far, there's no thematic disconnect like there was in the Star Wars LCG, but that's also due to the game being quicker and better, overall.

If you're not a fan of deck-building, that's okay, because the 30-card decks (with 2-card limit apiece) are quick to construct.
The games can play out with a narrative, and that's cool, but it doesn't tell a story like Rebellion can - it's a swift dice game, after all. Yes, the dice. I like their feel, size, and weight. The icons are clear and obvious, and the art is awesome-good.

The Max Rebo (elephant) in the room is obviously the collectable, blind booster marketing of the game. That sucks. We'd all prefer a 'living dice' system, but what we have is what they've presented us with, and we either suck it up, or don't buy it. The choice is before you, ladies!

NOTE: I've played the multi-player option a few times now, and while it's okay, I'd deduct 2-3 points off my rating for that format - maybe a team option would be less prone to kingmaking.

RATING: 8
Plays rather like Ashes: Rise of the Phoenixborn. It's a MTG derivative, it plays fast and tight. The theme doesn't get me too excited, it's SW, it's fine. I find the scope of the duel setting to be rather limited thematically, as in you can give a character a gun, or a lightsabre (European spelling :p) or something, even call in a Tie Fighter but that's not as interesting as in past Star Wars card games where you could employ an Imperial Star Destroyer, a fleet of X-Wings or an army of Ewoks. 

I think the "resources" mechanic is a bit pasted on too... What exactly are these mysterious resources and why do you need one in a fight? It's an enjoyable experience, but it's a dreaded CCG! *dun dun dunnn*

Deck building could be interesting as you not only construct a 30 card deck, but also assemble your characters which all start in play. 

I'm concerned about the Battlefield mechanic, where each player picks a battlefield which has a unique ability, but at the start of the game it's decided who's battlefield is being played on randomly and the other player receives a modest consolation in the form of 2 shield tokens to put on their characters. I can foresee situations where the battlefield is incredibly useful for one player and utterly pointless for another, giving a big advantage to the player who's battlefield is being used for the match. e.g. the battlefield's ability interacts specifically with support cards, one player's deck is built around support cards and the other player has none.

Above all I'd recommend listening to "Duel of the Fates" on YouTube whilst playing.

Érdekes volt, pörgős kis adok-kapok, az SW-fanok bizonyára örömmel veszik az érkezését. A kockák és a lapok rengeteg kombinálást adnak, ráadásul előbbiek sem randomitást hoznak a játékba, mert össze-vissza variálhatóak és változtathatóak, ráadásul az ellenfél kockáit is meg tudjuk semmisíteni vagy át tudjuk forgatni... A boosteres megoldás mondjuk elsőre nem tetszik, de aki rákattan a játékra, annak biztos élvezetes lesz a dolog. FFG, szóval itt azért mki tudja mire számítson, bár lehet az alapcsomaggal (kettő kell belőle kapásból) is élvezetes csatákat játszani, de igény esetén bele lehet ölni egy "nagy társas" árát is a dologba.

A collectible game that shares a lot with Ashes of the Phoenixborn as it mixes card play with dice actions.  Variance is high and mitigation of that is one of the keys to winning.  

Simple to learn, difficult to play well.  There are lots of interesting decisions to make within a game round.  As long as card balance remains reasonable this should be enjoyable for a long time to come.

Hmmm... I am intrigued!  I am NOT a fan of "collectible" games, but like the idea of this - I like the idea of all the new canon/movie characters (there aren't too many games available where you can possibly get Dooku, Grevious, Qui-Gon, etc); I like the fact that it is a short game (I love the LCG and like Imp Assault, but they can be a little long if looking for a "filler" game); and it looks like boosters will be pretty cheap.  

As far as some of the initial hating on this for being "collectible", I don't have a problem with that since there are already many great SW games from FFG which are not collectible (Armada, LCG, IA, etc), so if someone loves SW but doesn't like collectible, there are still plenty of good options! :P

As much as I may rate Star Wars: Destiny highly, I fear that any game with an evolving meta, shaped by an ever-increasing pool of cards, makes it impossible to keep up with and ultimately just play casually, especially in my case. It really becomes a lifestyle, requiring dedication to that of eSports. Unfortunately it also suffers from the FoMO-induced collectability aspect found in other CCGs, further exploited by the secondary market.

Only recommended if you either have enough time to dedicate yourself to the meta or don't care about it at all - definitely not suited for inbetweeners.

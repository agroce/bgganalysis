very fun system and for someone who is overwhelmingly a sci-fi fan, to have skipped BOTH previous games based on this engine only to dive right into this one, I could not be happier! I am glad the other two properties have good representations of this, and I may yet circle around now that the miniatures gates have reopened, but for now I am solidly in favor of this one. It really feels very epic and extremely fun to witness these colossal beasts fighting it out over whatever it is they want this time. Its cool to be a part and see that unfold, to both fear and awe the units both you and your opponents have wielded..this plays fast and fun (beyond the learning curve) and is well worth the time if you are into miniatures gaming.

I picked this up for cheap at the insistence of my middle son who loves dragons.  I love how modular the rules are and that you can play with as little or as much complexity as you want.  He is already asking for more dragons, even if we haven't played very often yet, maybe only for the toy factor.

It was fun, and I usually don't do this but the score is lowered for non-gameplay reasons. This is only because they are so bad that they continue to nag at me as I'm playing. The component quality is horrible; and the artwork and layout on tokens and non-dragon cards is on par with my 80's and 90's game titles. The Buffy board game surpasses this in style. (Dragon Minis aside)

It felt like I was playing with prototype components. The rulebook even suffers from this.

I'll still play it and enjoy it, but the only reason I got this over X-Wing is for larger multiplayer FFA matches. I know the Bounty Hunters exist in X-Wing, but it's easier to just have 5 different dragons all charging at each other. Maybe 8/10 if they improved the display on... pretty much everything. It would still feel like a rushed cash-in that'll be dead in 3 years.

The more I play of this game the more I realize that it is perhaps the best iteration of the Flight Path System. It does take a clean system and adds overhead, which if you do take the time to learn and really get into pays off with added depth and interest. BUT, being a WizKids game you really have to take ownership over it to make it work. The units and cards aren't as tuned as X-Wing but giant leaps better than Star Trek. The issue is that the campaign, which originally was a big draw, hasn't been that fun. I feel restricted and limited, unable to bring to the table what I want and armed how I'd like. I really wish it had a default scenario like X-Wing where the regular mode of play is to skirmish with the campaigns/adventures being a nice side distraction, like X-Wing. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
The only flight path game I'm allowed to own, as I have something of an acquisition/completion issue. 

I really, really like playing this version, the theme really grabs me. Just seeing dragons with giant wingspans on the table is a joy. 

The upgrades aren't complicated to understand, though building an army isn't for everyone. My wife will play the game, though she has exactly zero interest in building her own army. Generally, I'll build six or seven, match them as evenly as possible, and we'll each pick one randomly. Then it becomes a test of skill, not army building. 

There doesn't seem to be nearly the presence in my area as both the Star Trek and Star Wars flight path games, which is a shame. I've tried starting an Attack Wing night with my local gaming group, but so far no luck. I'd have to travel 1.5 hours to find a group that plays the OP events once a month. Still, a great game that I really enjoy.

Same sort of thing as both Star wars X-wing and Star Trek attack wing using the same basic mechanics, namely the movement tracks and the d8 damage dice.

Models again are good and decently painted, although the gold dragon in the starter set does look a little funny because he is so shiny

Personally I prefer this theme (and who wouldn't) to the space ship battle theme of both X-wing and Attack wing, but ultimately I just do not enjoy the spacial awareness skills required for determining where you move your ship/dragon, nor the fiddliness of all the tokens and special conditions.

I will play if you insist.. but I am more likely to physically play with the dragon models with my daughter (9) terrorizing princesses in towers than I am to play by the rules of this game. :)

Playing the scenarios is much more enjoyable for us than playing skirmishes.  One complaint is that my spouse has is with the overwhelming number of ability cards that need to be sorted through to customize the characters; there are too many choices, and she doesn't enjoy games that require building a character or deck.  Of course, that's part of the game and why others like it.  I will usually end up choosing balanced abilities for both sides before we play.

I do not plan on rating any of the 'expansion' pieces.

Not as polished as X-wing, but an upgrade over STAW in that the minis are much higher quality and the characters have some defense, which allows more interesting maneuver and force-building.  

I personally think the maneuver templates more thematically match starship combat, but that could just be because I played X-wing first.  If you really like fantasy over SF, I could see going for this over X-wing.

On the negative side, the characters and upgrades I did see had somewhat questionable balance - Wizkids don't seem to highly value either balance or playtesting, which probably isn't feasible with a wave-per-month release schedule anyway.

Another negative is that this game is more rock-paper-scissors than X-wing in that certain characters/upgrades can't really hurt others.  I like the fact that in X-wing, even the weakest fighter (TIE Academy pilot) can do damage if flown well.

I won't be buying into this game.  I'll play it if someone else owns it and wants to set it up, but that's as far as it goes.

I see they also kept the competitive prizes BS from STAW, so that would completely rule out any tournament play for me.

Innocent enough? Oh no! 
Now I somehow own 7/8ths of all releases.
T'was a Slippery Slope of Doom! But so worth it.

The game looks and feels proper sexy, this incarnation appears to have refined the rules to remove all of the previous wrinkles. This is the theme to make the system shine. Ground units are just as fun to play as the dragons.
The game is a total blast. Back to back cheering and crying all the way, every time. The slim possibility that any member of your legion could, on a bad day, get one shotted, keeps you hyped every combat phase. Brutal, in your face, no pissing about, non stop thrills spills and action from the first engagement to the end. The D&D theme comes over in bucket loads, with spells, upgrades and creatures we all recognise. Just Awesome! 
A game always exciting to bring to the table. Never a damp squib moment. D&DAW rocks. 
The poster boy of the theme is on hand too. The one and only Drizzt. fuckin mint!

This is the version to play if you want to have a maxed out fun session. Linked adventures in every release, making a full campaign. Means everything you buy gets table time, ground and air units alike. A far far superior game model, with rules and scenarios actually worthy of large collection investment. Legion building is great, with no need for 7 (or even 2) of the same creatures. Its consistently cool and entertaining at 90 points, all the way up to 300 points. The system this time, accommodates anywhere between 2 and 6 players easily. Play time never gets silly and the only thing that changes with scale is the table size, but that also is down to your preference. Shame it hasn't received the fanbase it deserves, space planes obviously proved more geek friendly i guess. More fool them, they are missing a real treat here.
Love Love Love!

Quick, fun, down and dirty miniatures game.  Really enjoy the attack wing system and it the only way I'd play a tactical miniatures game like this again, sorry Warhammer.

The models are very nice and prepainted, so for someone like me who can't paint that's a huge plus.  

The biggest knock on the game is the same thing for any miniatures game... tons of expansion units.  That means you could be dropping a lot of money on this game if you really get hooked.

This is a great game that borrows its mechanics from X-Wing. The conversion from spaceships to dragons works perfectly. The addition of ground troops not found in X-Wing really adds an extra dimension to the game and is the main reason to own both this and X-Wing. 

The rules are not too difficult to learn and are fun. The tactics of aerial combat are well represented by the turn dial and the manoeuvre markers. Though I have had a few games where we used less dragons and ended up chasing each other around the board for multiple turns, which can get boring quickly. This is negated by having bigger armies.

A highlight of Attack Wing's game mechanics is the initiative rule. This allows players to take turns activating their figures, meaning there's very little down time. Even when it's not your turn you're rolling defence dice.  

The quality of the components doesn't quite match X-Wing, but that's to be expected as Attack Wing is by WizKids while X-Wing is by Fantasy Flight.

Dragons swooping past each other, clawing at each other and shooting fireballs, casting spells and avoiding obstacles. Really good implementation of the attack wing/x-wing system. Has the added spell effects and other things that may bog down the game slightly but appeals really well to fantasy RPG players who are familiar with them.

The campaign system in the game is great and gives a really fun way to play through the game and try out all the units.

This sits lower than x-wing and armada to me not because of the popularity but because the game can get a bit clunky at times. The spells while being a nice mechanic tend to bog the game down quite a bit as there can be a lot to track in a turn as a result of them. The tokens for the spells are also a bit of a pain to organize as theres so many of them you have to contend with that finding the ones you need for your cards.

Probably the best use yet of the Wings of Glory/Xwing/Star Trek etc family of movement systems. This is -THE- miniatures game for boardgamers. Hardcore wargamers will no doubt rage at the simple movement mechanics for troops, but for those who want a fantasy war in 1-2 hours, here you go. To save on space I will note for anyone who wants to play a round I have at least one of all expansion packs including blind bricks, and all tournament promos and prizes. Still hoping for a revival of the competitive play scene. I have since given up on a revival of the competitive scene and would be interested in trading or selling my collection (absolutely complete with all prizes and promos, to the best of my knowlege) to anyone interested, please PM me for details, I don't log in here daily but I will get back to you.

Heroclix was my only experience with minis games until I decided to take the dive into D&D Attack Wing. And I do not regret diving into this game! The gameplay is pretty quick and has amazing figures.

I believe the game is fairly balanced. One flying and one ground unit is what I start with when building a team. Then I upgrade each unit with one upgrade that ups attack or penetrates armor. The rest of the points go to other figures and cards to support the initial two figures.

This is my favorite game of 2015 and will probably be my fave for a long time.

RATING: 8
Fun game made better on a 4x4 table with terrain rules. Small based ground units running for cover in a forest (+1 def die and cant be swooped on) or flying units using cloud cover are some examples of adding more tactical options. Does it add to the complexity? Sure, but as a Warmachine player it becomes a much more enjoyable game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Out of all the flight path games easily the most balanced, also adds in new and unique mechanics never before seen in other flight path games such as the ability to land on the ground or change altitude. The figures are very enjoyable to play and much more easy to envision. Very enjoyable, even losing games are often enjoyable.

Dungeons & Dragons: Attack Wing uses the core rule set of the FlightPath game system seen previously in Star Wars: X-Wing and Star Trek: Attack Wing, but with a Dungeons & Dragons twist as the players now control dogfighting dragons, while also having forces on the ground such as giants and magic users. As with Star Trek: Attack Wing, the Dungeons & Dragons: Attack Wing game series consists of a starter set and expansion packs.

The Dungeons & Dragons: Attack Wing – Starter Set includes three pre-painted dragons, maneuver dials, and upgrade cards and tokens.

[COLOR=#FF3300]My issue with this one, unlike HeroClix is the LACK OF creativity AND strategy. If I want to get more variety, I must purchase additional  models, which as the time flies by (pun intended), gets me shackled with the legion building choices. 

You can't deny that the majority of game lies in the maneuvering of the models, but come on, I've spent more than 150 euros and all I have are these same team compositions? For that amount of €€€, I could of gotten myself Duel of Ages Master Set and be set for life.[/COLOR]

(5+ plays)  It plays a lot like X-Wing with the fantasy theme.  Some of the tweaks to the gameplay, such as the armor and the end phase work really well with this theme.  The ground units add some complexity - and that part is a mixed bag.  Elven archers taking down a dragon with arrows can be a fun scene, and giants battling dragons really make for a storied tabletop experience.  That's the good.  But the swooping, movement rules, pivots, and other rules that come along with the mix of land and air units have a tendency to muck up a system that is very elegant for an air only dogfight.

Ultimately, it's the same engine as on of my favorite games and a blast to play and I hope to get it on the table quite a few times.

This game uses the same FlightPath system used in Star Trek: Attack Wing and Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game.  This one is just set in the world of Dungeons and Dragons.  I love dragons and fantasy settings so when I heard about this game coming out (I already was somewhat intrigued by the other FlightPath system games) I prepared my wallet for abuse.

The FlightPath system is played by placing miniatures with matching stat cards on a play surface and doing skirmish battles using these cardboard templates that dictate where and how the miniatures move as well as abilities that can be enhanced with different equipment, spells, etc.

I've said before that I am very interested, in theory, in miniatures gaming.  I love turn-based strategy video games and miniatures games are just the tactile equivalent of that.  However, the cost to entry and upkeep is usually so huge that it has scared me away from getting into any miniatures gaming.  Plus I don't know how to paint miniatures.  Games like this definitely do a lot to alleviate that.  While it can still be expensive as you keep buying all the new releases the cost seems to be a lot smaller by comparison to many miniatures games.  The FlightPath system is also really intriguing to me even though sometimes, while flying through other characters or running into them, managing all that can be a chore.  Oh, and everything comes pre-painted and they actually look really good.

Having played it, I am still just as interested as ever.  You definitely need to play with someone who has the same enthusiasm as you and you want to put together different and varied teams.  The base set allows you to only really play 1 dragon vs. another and that can get a bit boring.  But the variety of different things you can do and the strategy inherent in not only choosing the right abilities to use but also placement and movement decisions on the playing surface offer incredible depth and variety.  It really is like playing a TBS video game but in real life.

I've played D&D since about 1979 or so.  I really like the way this system plays.  The way things work and the rules can seem a bit much at first, but after a run through or 2 it makes sense and the flow of the game speeds up.  The game mechanics are simple enough, getting the "order" down will help with planning.  

The miniatures are pretty well detailed so I think they look good.  Scenarios that come with various scenarios and this helps give some structure to play.  There are scenarios that form a longer campaign and this helps for a longer term plot like for those who desire such a thing.  As always you can just build a couple armies and go at it, also fun.    

Building armies is done with a point based system that will be familiar to anyone who has played anything like that before and easy for a new person to pick up.  So for me I get my miniature and D&D fix in one package that is fun to play.  Couple that with an active imagination and fun banter during play and I've got a fun day planned.

Also, the rules forums on Wizkids site is very good for rule/clarification on things that may be confusing.

Essentially X-Wing with dragons.

The basic game is too basic and the full game comes with what seemed like a 40 page rulebook! Throwing stuff at Wings of Glory does not make for a better game.

I participated in a demo of this at Gen Con.  It is gorgeous.  Once again a new dimension is added to this flight path system with ground troops, spells, melee attacks, and breath weapons.  The pictures on the cards and the sculpts are awesome.  Way higher quality than ST:AW, which I love.  This is going to be really huge!

Will trade for games or cash but only face to face. 

I went from being skeptical of this as an ill thought out cash grab from the company to being COMPLETELY won over by it's surprising depth, balance, variety and well thought out tweaks to the Flightpath system. Delightful!
11-3-17: The problem with these sorts of games is that many (most?) of the people that get into them do so because the want the excitement of a new toy and enjoy thinking about what the NEXT new toy they can get to add to it. When a system stops coming out with new toys, those players buy OTHER toys. And while customizing and building your thematic war party is awesome, your other players need to keep getting excited about the same kind of preparations with you. When people lose their head of steam, then no one has the motivation to bring everything back out and start again. I must find some sort of compromise...

We only have the dragons, enough to play 3 dragons each.  While I love star wars for the build outs of the ships- this game is an exact replica (which I knew ahead of time) but it seems like a good amount of money needs to be spent to build up some ground units and other types of units besides the dragons. I wanted to paint these as well just to get them better looking on the board.

If your looking for this play style and have great looking models and dont care on the subject matter, X-wing is the best by far!

I'm not good at this. In general I don't like games that make me feel stupid.

Great game - bought so could play with my 10 year old but my wife & 7 yr old daughter love the basic game as well - thats one of the beauties of it as it has basic and advanced playing styles so something for everyone.  Only downside is space needed to store the models!

Own the main game plus lots of unopened expansions. Wishing this game would come back to life.

Got this at a ridiculous discount. Looking to play or augment Frostgrave wight he minis.

:D

I have spent a total of $11.59 for all my D&D Attack Wing thanks to trading in MtG cards, a $25 gift certificate from my wife, and the 50% off sale at my LGS.

Rating based on cheapness of entry for me, rules read, and pre play anticipation.

Okay, I have to admit the dragons are pretty cool and I'm glad they ported over the Attack Wing system to the fantasy world of D&D.  I primarily purchased it for dragon on dragon combat.

FlightPath system with D&D magical dragons and classic fantasy ground pounders. Dragons don't lose turns when they bump. Win the tournament challenge and get the Tiamat.

This is by far my favorite miniatures game, and I've played tons, WH40k, X-Wing, ST Attack Wing, Infinity, WarmaHordes, etc.  

Combining the Flight Path system with Melee troops is extremely engaging, and requires you to not just plan ahead, but also requires the flexibility to change your plans at a moment's notice.   It's a wonderfully strategic and tactical experience.

Like X-Wing but with Dragon, which instantly makes it cooler. Have only played the intro game, but already like the feel and balance.

Awesome game, but I can't get into it the way that I would like to because of other games.

Partial play

I like the idea of this game, but it feels really restrictive with only being able to challenge the previous player. I read that someone tried an open challenge variant, and I think that may change my opinion of the game dramatically.

In the mold of other classic bluffing games, but I appreciated a couple of twists that were added (if you challenge, you only choose one of the player's cards to test their truthfulness)

With the right people, it can be quite a lot of fun. Nice to have but Kakerlakenpoker rules all these bluffing games..

Del tutto simile al gioco Dubito, ma con alcune varianti interessanti.

More or less is a Cheat game, but designer inserted some interesting twists.

It’s a simple card game with a major bluffing element to it. You place a number of cards face down of a specified number and the player can either challenge you or play the same number. 

Eventually it is apparent that someone has been lying about what they have placed down. But was it the last player to have played? 

Mammuz is a terrific 15 minute family card game.

Nice bluffing little game. There are several ways to trick opponents, as you play you come up with more. I felt it is not so suitable for children, because sometimes the bluffing is complex to avoid getting challenged. I played it letting anyone to call any one card of a given display.

Sort of a cross between Bugs and Cockroach Poker.  Players race to get rid of their cards as quickly as possible but cards are played face-down, and you can always challenge the player before you. If you do challenge, you only get to inspect part of what they played, though, so even with only a partly "legal" play there is a chance they will succeed.

Short, entertaining and plays up to 7.

A better Cockroach Poker. Instead of the one loser, in this game you have one winner, which feels better. The animals illustrations are cute.

Very cute anti-trick taking game. Bluffing is key to winning. The goal is to get rid of all of your cards. 

You play follow the leading suit/herd or challenge the previous player. The catch here is cards played are face down, so you can bluff that you have whatever the suit is. (ie: Playing 2 bears when neither of the cards actually are bears).
A person challenging the previous player flips over one of the cards that person played face-down. If that card is not part of the herd, then the person who called the challenge must take ALL cards from the middle of the table. If the person challenged (the previous player) was caught playing something off suit, THEY take ALL cards from the middle of the table.

There are a few special dinosaur cards that throw a monkey wrench into the mix. Plays up to 7 people quickly.

MammuZ is a cute game of bluff.  Unfortunately, it doesn't scale well below five players.  At three, it's almost unplayable and at four, it's barely better.  However, you can really feel the game working the way it should at five and higher with all cards in play and working to their full potential with the eights and nines.  That being said, there are still better bluffing games out there and MammuZ sort of gets lost in the shuffle for me.

Light bluffing game similar to Liar's Dice. Dalmuti style cards instead of generic six-sided dice. In that, it is more similar to Nimm's Leich. The crucial thing is that I enjoyed MammuZ more than both Liar's Dice and Nimm's Leich.

Great little bluffing game. Me and my family love it. It is one of the best opener we know but it is not even an opener, most of the time we start with this we do not play other games. Superb game!

It's a simple filler. But great fun once you've grasped what's going on. I'd suggest playing 2 or 3 times before trying to decide if you like it or not. That'll only take about 30 minutes anyway.

Giochino di carte senza troppe pretese e non molto originale. Si rifà un po' a Perudo (ma anche a Anno Domini) con la stessa logico della  dichiarazione e del dubito successivo. Come in Perudo le informazioni sono nascoste e quindi più che strategico o di conoscenza il gioco si basa sull'intuito e un pizzico di psicologia. Niente di impegnativo comunque, si tratta di un filler da pochi minuti e qualche risata.

Party játék. A szabály pár mondatban összefoglalható, a lényeg az, hogy elfogyasszuk a az állatos lapjainkat. Két dolgot tehet a játékos, elhiszi, hogy az előző játékos 1-4 darabból valamennyit valóban lerakott, vagy nem hiszi el, mert ugye blöffölni is lehet, ilyenkor ha tévedett, akkor felhúzza az összes eddig kijátszott lapot, vagy ha bejött a sejtése, akkor az előző játékos húz fel mindent.

Fun little fibbing filler paleo-themed card game where you attempt to go out first by passing off your cards to other players or causing them to go extinct by collecting an entire suite of one species. We love the take that aspect introduced with the dinosaur cards even if they do extend the game a bit. It plays relatively quickly so you can fit in a few matches in between your more fulfilling gaming.

tl;dr: sounded way better than it was

This game combines elements from [thing=45][/thing] and [thing=58696][/thing], two games I enjoy. So this sounded very promising. Except that it didn't work very well and it was very unexciting. I think it simply doesn't give you enough options.
Quite often you are forced to challenge the last player because you know making a claim would be ridiculous. But you also know that the previous player probably wasn't bluffing or not entirely. Which means you're screwed.
Not exciting at all.

Initial rating: 5/10
BGG scale: 4/10

tl;dr: it is as good as it sounded

It turns out we played this game wrong the first time. So we gave it an other chance. And I must say I was dead wrong last time. This is a fun game that might even be up there with [thing=58696][/thing]. If you bluff the right way, some hilarious stuff can happen!

Revised score: 7/10
BGG scale: 7/10

A very light and fairly silly game of bluffing and outright lying. There's some charm here and a decent amount of fun to be had, but it won't live long in the memory.

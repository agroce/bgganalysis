Loads of fun and re-playability since you customize your monster!  It does seem like the game favors the monster.  This could be tweaked by adding about 10-20 more victory points required by the monster.

I really get into this when I'm the monster -- roars, growls, and such...and when I have the blinding light power, I'm particularly obnoxious.  Just an awesome game that is fun, fun, fun!

Any game about a large creature eating my hometown's archrival to the south gets a 10 in my book. But this was only after it gobbled up my hometown. The designer (Greg Costikyan) was one of the better SPI designers in my opinion. He missed the bratwurst counter and optional rule in designing this game though.

Last played circa 1980, but I remember it was a good game. Possibly a "7". Ability to select monster powers provided interest and good variety.

Playing the humans was tricky because the monster could usually outmove you, so you had to disperse and accept losses while catching up with him. A variant using the components for anti-terrorist operations seemed a good idea, but I haven't looked at it let alone tried it

I came up with some rules for a three-player game à la the various Godzilla vs. X movies; key factor was that monsters must fight each other if they can "see" each other. Not sure if it was balanced--would probably need some way to allow the monsters to "disengage". Rules unfortunately were handwritten and left with the friend who actually owned the game.

Wow, what a great game. This is pretty awesome for it's age and is easily configurable for all kinds of homemade varients.

It's not much to look at, with the paper map and cardboard chits, but don't let that hold you back. This is an amazingly fun game. It feels like your in the middle of a Godzilla movie. You can make any kind of crazy creature that you want and then unleash it on the city, to wreak havoc among the populace.

I especially like the mechanic used, for how fires spread. Depending on the wind direction. It's just a pure crazy and fun game.

I owned this as a kid and remember playing it numerous times.  I thought the game was real thin on strategy.  Its most redeeming quality was its quick play.  I also owned the companion game to this.

Got a copy as part of a set.  Probably will play again.

Loads of fun, even if it is broken. (As others have pointed out, a fire-breathing monster WILL have the city in flames before you can kill it. But you can always play monsters without the fire-breathing power.) I want a 3D version!

RATING: 8
Fun- create your own 'giant monster' from point totals VS defenders purchased from a point total.  Sort of like a different company's giant tank game?  But the special abilities of the monster make all the difference. If you play FTF be flexable about line of sight for ranged attacks, OR try and define problem locations before play and come to an agreement.

RATING: 8.4
A very underated game.  The game is wide op;en for house rules as well as new units, say a Maser, air strikes, etc.  New powers for the monsters.  However, it plays great as is.  Also try, 2 monsters VS the Army and 1 mosnter.  Always fun to play.

I'm building a board for this one and 3D figures. I have yet to play this little minigame and so have no opinion about it either way. 

I do like the building of the monster though. I'm really looking forward to it. The 3d set is a gift for my friend who loves Godzilla; :) I'm building a city scape and using Godzilla 'Pack of Destruction' monsters as the figures. I'll post when I get it done. I'm also hoping to find little firefighter figures and such to use too.

This is a great theme for a game - I really wish someone would make something similar today with a fresh set of mechanics (hmmm...). There's a simple winning strategy for the brew-your-own monster. No attack, super fast, fire breathing, rest into defense, and then you zoom around the city burning it down as you go. The humans can't keep up and can't hurt you. Monster wins.

RATING: 9
Fast and fun, a light-hearted classic that I have played at least two dozen times. It is adaptable to solo play. It's slightly unbalanced in favor of the monster, but then I think that's part of the fun. A perfect game for making up new rules, especially new powers for the monster. Can get an entire evening's worth of fun from this one if you take turns playing the monster. Occasionally, if the monster chooses the right powers and the human player sets up poorly, the game will turn into a rout for the monster. Even these admittedly rare occurrences are fun--you'll laugh all the way through and then start again. In my experience, the radiation ability is the most unbalancing. Flame powers and flight also can unbalance a game. But again, who cares? We're all cheering for the monster, anyway. An all-time classic.

NOT for trade, don't ask.

Fun monster romp game.  Plays very quickly, and the variety of monster choices adds freshness.  I have to learn not to let my monster get boxed in so easily, though!  So far we've had jumping spiders, lightning-fast serpents, and fire-breathing gorillas.  Poor Sheboygan has been reduced to rubble more often than not.  Only 4 pages of rules.  I have the boxed version.  And I finally got to play a monster!

I'm mystified why a publisher hasn't take "The Creature that Ate Sheboygan" and republished it with really nice bits and board. 

But as of 2017, what we still have in the original 1979 version, in which the rules are typically badly written (from that period)--namely, excess verbiage and too formal in style. Also, some of the rules are unnecessarily fiddly. 

I rewrote the rules into two 8.5 x 11" sides in 11-point Arial Narrow for easy reference (not including scenario or special ability descriptions, which appear on p. 4 of the 4-page rule book). 

The style of play is a bit dated, but this could be a really nice game if a company (like maybe Fantasy Flight) would re-do it with nice bits and more up-to-date rules--maybe some event cards, for example, to introduce some theme and random elements. 

I've played it many more times than the five I have listed (as of November 2012). Reacquired by trade (copy in shrink-wrap) in July of 2009.

I played this when I was younger, and recently bought a new copy just to have.

Its a fun, somewhat silly, game that's best not taken too seriously, but which can make for a pleasant afternnon's diversion.

A classic which ought to be in every gamer's collection, or at least every board gaming museum. Very simple war game which taught me everything I need to know about war games, namely that war games more complex than this are above my leisure-time pay grade. State-of-the-art mechanics from the late 1970s when science fiction themes became a viable genre of wargaming. Everyone who's been willing to try this -- and view it as a history lesson -- has enjoyed the experience.

For fans of giant monster/kaiju movies this game is a lot of fun, and creating your own monster is a blast. The game is very simple, but I gave it a Light Medium weight because there are a number of rules unique to different units and terrain that you have to remember, and you'll be using charts to determine outcomes for die rolls. The attack/defense ratio system works well but feels clunky. Nothing says action packed destruction like performing math, right? The bits are also cheap generic chits. Despite these complaints, it's still one of the best giant monster games out there and definitely cheaper than some of the new ones. You can even find the rulebook online.

An example of how a social trend can influence over games. Funny boardgame review about the vintage "monster attacking and destroying a city". Outdated. Only for die hard collectors.

RATING: 6
A grand romp (literally) that does a good job feeling like the action of a monster movie. Well, maybe not, but 'the national guard proving useless while the Hero discovers a solution' would work much better as an RPG than a board game. And I never liked that element in monster movies anyway.

Requires an easy house rule or two to work around a minor issue with the cost of one of the monster's powers.  It's fun, but a little slow.  This is a theme that I would love to see redone in a simple fast-paced game.

Comment and ratings based on 3 solo trials. A very decent game, considering the age. The old school wargame feel, which I'm usually happy with, seems to me somewhat at odds with the theme in this case.

RATING: 9
Great little 2 player mini-game that captures most everything you would want out of designing a monster and rampaging a city.  It is a bit funner to play the monster but the game is short enough to trade off.  

The excitement really comes on when you start to discover what you are up against.  You just never expect the power combinations as the cops.  Lots of fun (if only the firemen made any kind of logical sense in the game as creatures don't get points for burning buildings and as the defenders you want the buildings to burn to open line of sight)

This is a true classic that stands the test of time.

An inexpensive folio microgame (although it was also produced in a box).  Sort of like a giant movie monster version of OGRE/G.E.V., in the SPI style.

Original comment: One of the best micro wargames ever.

Revised after playing it for the first time in ~35 years: Not quite as much fun as I remember, but still a great game. Nostalgia probably plays a lot into my fond memories of this game. Also, playing this game solo isn't quite as fun as playing it with my old gaming buddy.

Having spent 'WAY too much time playing the similar-themed computer game "Crush, Crumble & Chomp!" I just HAD to own this. Here's a game that would really benefit from custom maps, of the cities you'd like to see go down a giant firebreathing lizard's gullet...

Conceptually this game is just awesome -- but the costs and unit strengths are completely out of whack (I think the designer said something about being balanced for a ranged system vs a close combat system and never getting readjusted when the change occurred)

One of my favourites, but quite a limited game in scope. The human forces just don't cover the hardware seen in the movies, and the map just isn't big enough. But the rules are simple and clear, and it's very playable.

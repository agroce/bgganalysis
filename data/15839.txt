Very interesting game made up focusing almost exlusively on maneuvering. Your units and those of your opponents are so well matched that attacking almost always results in a draw (in which case both units lose 1 strenght point and stay where they are), and so flanking becomes the only real way to force your opponent to retreat. 

This sounds like it would be an exercise in tedium, but the game forces a great deal of conflict through a) imbalanced numbers of units, and b) putting the objectives on the far end of the map. The whole game then revolves around a slight number of French units trying to stave off the massive lines of Austrian troops.

RATING: 8
The only luck in the game is choosing which units go to which starting position.

A very pretty game!

Certainly takes a little getting used to and not sure why or if its common, but I always seem to have a problem seeing where the areas are defined and how they connect in many area move games (so many lines - roads, terrain, etc - same problem in Monty's Gamble and RTC for example)...it is particularly bad here as the areas in the map are pretty faint.  As a game, pretty darn sharp.  Plays fast, has a fair amount of strategy and player skill for a diceless game. 

Much better than I expected.  Not much "Marengo" here - pretty bland representation of the history of the actual battle - but fun as far it goes. 

Best block game I have played.

Played it again and lowered my rating.  just has the wrong feel for Marengo to me.  This plays like a griding attritional battle in which each side loses slowly...the winner losing less slowly.  Not how I see marengo at all.  Massive shifts of fortune typify that battle to me.  The overall gestalt is wrong.

System is better suited to grinding battles like Borodino or Aspern-Essling...but certainly not Austerlitz (next game in the series).

Forget a lot of what you think you know about wargames.  This has no dice, CRTs, cards, hexes or point-to-points.  Instead, we get inovation, like approaches, locales and manoeuvre attacks.  Partly because of this, I think the rules might be more easily understood by Euro gamers than died-in-the-wool grognards.  The rules are not hard and become clearer upon playing. 

It's fun, challenging, short to play and attractive to look at.

And it just the sort of thing to keep a great hobby fresh.

RATING: 7.4
An excellent thoughtful game.  Gives a great sense of maneuver as move and countermove, like chess but with varying terrain and unit values.
I have only played solo so far but the excellently simple (that word again!) solo rules make for a proper challenge and all within the standard rules for a game.  I feared the solo play would not let me experience the standard game, but it does!

I put my rating 1 less than I might only because this game is so different it is not so easy to enter it's 'space', compared to other wargames in relation to each other, and thus it requires quite a bit more than the usual commitment.

Ordered this based on the web page and ConsimWorld buzz. My copy arrived in the UK a week after being dispatched so folks shouldn't be put off by the mail order-only policy.

First impressions: Looking good with mounted mapboard, wooden blocks, straightforward and well illustrated rules. An intriguing system - I look forward to seeing more from Simmons Games!

RATING: 8
First of it's kind that mimics the map and unit positions of warfare in that era. The simplicity of movement and combat makes this game a breeze to play. 

Having said that, that same simplicity also sees the game rejected by hardcore wargamers. The lack of details and tactical options as presented by the blocks are the main reason why this game is not rated even higher.

RATING: 8
A radical departure from hexes and counters that works really well once over a fairly steep learning curve.  I'm really impressed how simple mechanics are used to evoke the differences between infantry, artillery and cavalry, the importance of manoeuvre and of protecting your flanks. I found the game a lot of fun to play.  While the victory conditions do seem to favour the French, they are easily re-balanced.

The quality of the wooden pieces and mounted mapboard far exceeds the norm from GMT or MMP.  However, while the designer's intention to represent a period map is well realised, the important terrain symbols are rather faint.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I admire the innovative aspects of the game. The liniair formations on the edges of areas. It's an almost chess-like system, that portrays Napoleonic warfare from a generic point of view very well. Moving troops in position, outflanking, delaying with cavalry, difficulties with disengaging once in battle and such. 

On the negative side is:
* No historical identification of the units.
* Too abstracted units to my taste.
* I don't feel happy with the role of the artillery at this scale. It is as if they form one large battery. Besides the effect is too heavy.
* In battles you'll always have some form of luck, therefore I'm not very content with the combat system, which is too calculative.
* Rules are written in a not very user friendly way.
* The mapboard looks too flat in tone. It looks as if it is winter, while it is a summer battle.

But:
The BaM gamesystem will certainly evolve and be a blueprint for many other playable wargames in the future. I am looking forward to it.

This game requires a lot of thought to have a good strategy.  I like that there is no luck in this game beyond the initial set up, and also there is fog of war so you do not know what your opponent is throwing at you.  A very tense game that will provide tons of fun.

Cool system, love the maneuver.  The map is static, and the low initial density makes it seem like the game would be prone to early game optimization syndrome, but lots of people play it serially online.  The rules are digestable, but I found road movement so profoundly clunky compared with the rest of the game that it really irritated me.  Still, I wouldn't question anybody for loving the game.  For me, the best thing I got out of this was adding Jason Matthews as a GeekBuddy after reading his excellent review!

I'm on the learning curve with BaM.  3 very quick games played.
Rating will certainly not drop, I expect it to increase when I get a more thorough grip on the strategy.

Update: Increased the rating after a few plays.  Possibly a little small in its current incarnation and the early game isn't entirely interesting for me.  I'll reserve the 9 rating for Napoleon's Triumph :)

No dice, but oh so tricky! Rather than weighing odds, this game forces players to weigh losses. Nothing is free at Marengo, and luck favors the prepared. 

Marengo is a fantastic game that plays like a puzzle but feels like a wargame. It is the first game in a long time that allowed me to visualize the historic setting of the conflict.

RATING: 8.5
An original presentation.  Outstanding physical quality.  Play requires concentration but mechanics are very accessible.  Map and pieces compliment each other well.  Concept of "locales" and "approaches" together with the constraints of maneuver and commitment combine to provide a true experience of "military chess."  No blaming bad dice in this one!  You live or die by your own wits.  Very impressive.  I look forward to future products from Simmons Games.  BTW, the Web site is excellent and customer service is top-notch.

Updated after 5 games. Is it a wargame about Napoleonic warfare? There are still doubts. Not the thrill I thought when I bought the game. 
Beautiful components:  But I miss the randomness and historical flavor. War was and never will be without random events. So:
Components 10
Innovation 9
Realism 6
Completeness of rules: 6 (road movement)
Chrome 5
Time to play 10 (under 1.5 hours).
Simulation value: 5. I played the Marengo scenario with Napoleon Battles  a lot and with this miniatures system a loss of some Cavalry or Regiment was always painful. Here you simply swap an unnamed "3 block" against a "2 block". Making the historical involvement very light indeed.
But perhaps a good game for those who like a light wargame without much historical unit data (in fact no data at all). So why bother. In such kind of wargames (non-strategical) I LIKE to KNOW where the 1st Husars went...
It beats Axis and Allies of course as an introduction tool. BUT can the system be applied to other battles? One positive note: my 12 year old son likes it even more than Memoir 44, so it's perhaps not as dry as I first thought.
What makes me worry though is that he beats me now 4 times in a row with the French by pulling WAAAYYYY back, only 2 or 3 zones away from the victory points. Keeping a tight defence with manouvring on the inner lines. 
Yet to see an Allied win. So if the French pull back from the beginning it's a 90% win. So even playing Marengo as a Euro game is not funny anymore...

PLayed it with a friend at GenCon SoCal (RIP) and I believe I was the Austrians and lost in like the second turn because I totally screwed up a move at the beginning and it was impossible for me to recover because of the choke hold the French had from that point on.  I hear this happens a lot with new players and I need to work past it, but at this point there are other things I would rather do with my time.

Gorgeous looking blockgame with a great emphasis on manoeuvering. Rules are relatively simple but the game still has a pretty steep learning curve. Esspecially for the Austrian player who has to really understand the system to make any effective progress in the early game. I really like the deterministic diceless combat as it seems to fit the battles of this era well. I absolutely love the clean and crisp look of the game. After two games I only feel I've just scratched the surface of this amazing design. I look forward to playing it more.

After playing it a bit more the Austrians are starting to win. Understanding more and more about the game and getting better at it everytime. I absolutely love it!

A version 2 is coming out, and I'm planning to purchase it when it does.  The current version is unbalanced in favor of the French, but this can be remedied by having players bid for sides.  However, more signficantly, the French win by running away and making a stand at the edge of the board later.  Good play by both sides will not result in the historical counterattack by the French.  Hence, my official revision of the victory conditions:  at 4 pm you roll a die. On a roll of 1-3 the victory conditions remain as is. On a roll of 4-6 the French gain 5 morale points, increase one infantry by one strength point, increase one cavalry by one strength point and get one turn with four moves instead of three: but in order to win the French have to either break Austrian morale or take Marengo and keep it 'supplied' (no Austrian units on the road to Marengo). Otherwise, the French lose.

The advantage of this revision is that the French may have to counterattack to win.  If they play too conservatively in the early game and the die roll is 4-6, they will surely lose.  On the other hand, if the Austrians play too conservatively and the die roll is 1-3, __they__ will surely lose.  Each side has to pursue a balanced strategy.

RATING: 5
After one play: Ingenious, and brain-burning, recreation of the battle of Marengo between the French and Austrian armies. The visual production of the map and wooden playing pieces aid dramatically in understanding how Napoloenic battles looked (at least from the map-maker's perspective) and possibly developed. The real key to winning the game is to out-manuever your oppenent and to attack parts of their army from more directions than they can adequately cover. Attack is useful only if you're pretty sure you'll prise an enemy element  from their position with brute strength to gain a critical position that will unhinge the main enemy force-- otherwise, its a losing method of grinding down your opponent. This is possibly the poster-game for the so-called "Waro". A wargame that embodies eurogame mechanics to achieve the sort of simulation wargamers find necessary for their enjoyment of any battle game.

The revolutionary design gem, also a great game. Many don't like it that much because it feels to scripted, but I do like the chess like nature. Its bigger brother Napoleon's Triumph has more action, more options and more replay value, but if time's an issue and I am not in the mood for the angst and brain burn of NT, I happily dig out BaM again.

I really want to like this more than I do - it looks great, is ground breaking (no hexes, blocks that look like the formations etc) - so visually it ticks all the boxes, almost as good as playing a figure battle.

But it falls flat in gameplay :( It's not strategic or tactical enough for me, if that makes sense. Strategic games I want to play the war not a battle, tactical games I want more than this gives - manoeuvring on roads trying to avoid exposing flanks and trying to keep different troop types together feels more like a puzzle in logistics than a wargame, it needs a bit of randomness [for me anyway]. 

In the end it is too abstract, and I have no desire to 'master' it in the way you have to master an abstract with repeat plays and study. Result is it sat unplayed for about 2 years on my shelf, finally traded it away.

RATING: 8.5
This is an amazing game!  The mechanics are so simple, but you wind up with a very real looking napoleonic battle.  The tactical choices of the game are pretty straightforward - usually you will want to do more than you are allowed to just in terms of maneuvering your troops out of danger, and attacking.  But the strategic choices of the game are what make it - the struggle to find a way to lure your opponent into the perfect trap.  The only downside is that it's hard to play just one game, but your brain really hurts by the end of the second.

I am not sure what this game has to do with Napoleonic warfare, but it is pretty and plays on a beutiful map of Marengo's environs. This really is more of an abstract than a wargame. The game relys on fog of war (hidden units). At this level (grand tactical) that is just not believable. This would work much better at the operational level.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Wow--this game is not at all what I was expecting going into it. Grognards, be aware, this is most definitely NOT a simulation-game. Rather it's a somewhat abstract game of maneuver...old tactical standby maxims like "concentration of force" and grind-it-out attrition WILL NOT APPLY here! This game is WAY different from a standard hex-and-counter experience, so just deal with it. On the plus side, the rules are far less voluminous than most "wargames". Yet the quite elegant mechanics are so far removed from a "traditional" wargames that it will likely seem somewhat frustrating at first (it was for me). But after 1.33 games, I think I grok the mechanics well enough to where it will be really fun next time, and my rating will likely improve with more plays. I can easily see this becoming a personal favorite.
Austrians, it's ALL about initial deployment--get those cannon up QUICK; you'll need them to reduce the thin French defenses to a sufficient level for a breakthrough! But don't leave them undefended--that is the path to certain defeat. This game is one of maneuver, not firepower, so don't count on your advantage of numbers to win the day, 'cause it WON'T!  
Frenchies, it's one long delaying action--knowing when to cut and run is key, as is establishing a cohesive line of defense--sometimes you're gonna have to make painful sacrifices to allow more valuable units to escape! Understand going in that the line of battle will inevitably creep closer to your end of the board, and the best Napoleon can accomplish is a phased, orderly withdrawl--under no circumstances can you allow the Austrians to burst past you on a flanking "end run" for those rear objective areas. For the French, it's a matter of mimizing casualties while stalling Austria for as long as possible.
Strangely, the game I would most readily compare BaM's "feel" of play to is, of all things, Tikal! Neither player will EVER feel as though they have sufficient action points for the turn--you must make the most of them at all times. Despite some rough spots in our first play, this game is PDC--Pretty Damn Cool!

In storage?

Rating based on one play.  Wow, what a game!  Elegant rule system that's easy to remember, feels almost like an abstract.  Hardly had to look anything up even on the first play.  Lost as the Austrians because sense of urgency came WAY too late.  Now my brain is busy calculating all the things I'll do differently next time, which is for me the sign of a good game.  Rating may well rise with more plays.

Well implemented game. I've played it a fair bit now and it's a real nice face to face game...not really my style of game or subject hence the lowish rating. If you are any kind of Napoleonic buff you either own this game already or somehow you've never heard of it.

I like the blocks and the look.  The rules are a bit clunky in some places and the strategy is kind difficult to wrap your brain around (not a complaint with the game but don't expect to come in and play well the first time).  So it is a nice game but really needs repeated playings to shine.  Which then comes to the problem-- so many games, so little time...  is this one worth a few sittings?  It does play pretty quickly though.

I've been reading and re-reading the rules for the past 4 years and still have yet to put it on the table against an opponent. Combat without dice seems almost too simple, but I still feel like the movement and positioning of units would make it feel very "warlike".

I liked this, although I wasn't blown away, and am not quite sure why. I love the look of the game, I like the elegance, I like the interesting take on the area movement and block game genres. But the game somehow lacked energy. Playing a game like Rommel in the Desert gives me a visceral thrill, some excitement and tension. Bonaparte at Marengo is a good game, but it doesn't quite provide the excitement that I crave in this sort of game. At the end of the day, I'm not sure the decision to go diceless was entirely wise.

Don't take these comments the wrong way; I think BaM is a good and well-executed game and worth playing. It's in the second tier of wargames, good stuff, and the fact that it's simple and playable means it can happily occupy that second tier and be worthwhile. I'm glad I got to play it, and wouldn't mind playing more. But on the other hand, there are an awful lot of wargames competing for my attention, it does still take a couple hours to play, it's modestly expensive, and it just hasn't been able to get back on the table; of the two recent, new first-time block-game publisher's games, Victoria Cross generates more enthusiasm to play again, albeit not by a huge margin.

BaM is a first class game, that works about as well as Chess, if both players know the rules.  The rules are a little harder to understand than they first appear, but they are thorough and consistent.  The support that Mr. Bowen Simmons provides is perhaps the best of any game publisher today.  Check out his fantastic website at http://www.simmonsgames.com/

RATING: 4
Very clever design forcing one to go back to the concept of linear warfare; you must fix and flank your opponent's lines since bulling through the middle is unlikely to work. Physically admirable, well tested (the game is very close), and innovative. If this were all that a wargame needs I 'd score this 10.5

However, I do not see it as a good recreation of the battle or of the tactics applied by period officers to "solving the puzzle". BaM is a good game for chess players and those who like to build a superior plan by careful improvement. For those of us who want the chaos of a real battle and the feeling of the storyboard then it simply does not work after 3 playings.

You'll find those 3 playings challenging.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Richard Sivèl's glowing praise for BaM and its innovative concept awakened my interest in a game belonging to a genre I otherwise have little interest in: tactical wargames. This is partly due to me wanting to see the "big picture" rather than focus on single battles, but  I also missed "The Look" - as Bowen Simmons calls it. The typical hex battle games didn't do it for me.

BaM's innovative system however impresses me far more than the actual scenario, which only portrays the Austrian advance and perhaps the renewed battle. A French counterattack? There's no game incentive or sufficient time for this. In short: The dramatic to-and-fro simply isn't here. In other words, the package only contains half the battle. A real pity particularly since such advance & counterattack would have made the game very exciting, whereas BaM's typical game may turn out to be rather formulaic in the midgame and anticlimactic towards the end.

Hence my initial fascination with BaM has been dampened and I haven't played it since reaching that point. The replay value strikes me as being rather limited. 

Oh yeah, I don't recommend reading up on the actual battle. Seeing how BaM does not allow for such a course of events really put a considerable damper on my enthusiasm.
 
Bottom line: BRILLIANT game system. Clearly an important milestone in wargame design. However, the scenario is somewhat unsatisfying - both in  historical and gameplay terms. Let us hope that Bowen's upcoming Austerlitz game will deliver a scenario realizing the potential offered by the game system. BaM - much like We the People - is a groundbreaking game, yet no true classic. A game showing system's full maturity and greatness has yet to follow - just like Hannibal in respect to We the People.

Friedrich is my "Euro-wargame" hybrid of choice as this one just feels a little too dry and abstract, but that may change with more plays. However, I'm still looking forward to Napoleon's Triumph.

UPDATE: Napoleon's Triumph is a definite improvement. Many BaM players are claiming they'll continue to play both but for me NT makes BaM obsolete. BaM is a design I appreciate more than enjoy. NT is a design I both appreciate and enjoy.

A beautiful game. Excellent quality components at a pretty low price. A game that forces you to make tough decisions, and in which you always want a little bit more than you actually have. 

Still, after several plays I've found the initial allure to have worn off. It's probably too deterministic for my tastes, and it is utterly ahistoric in the way it plays out. For some reason it also seems to give me a headache when I play, which doesn't help!

I enjoy playing both sides, and enjoy the unique system that encourages maneuver over assault, which fits the period.  Plays quickly, and has rules that, while complex at first, quickly become second nature.

Fun to play, forces players to manuever to win.  Relatively simple to learn, but the road movement rules are tough to use.  Plays quickly.  Beautiful components.

RATING: 8
Left a very good first impression.  The rules aren't necessarily complicated, but the rulebook is not very easy to learn from.  With these simple rules there is much depth in tactics and strategy that gives off a Napoleonic feel far better than I initially imagined.  This is a great game, playable in under two hours, which is a great plus.  My only concern is that it is fairly abstract and luckless... which generally are things I don't enjoy, but here I'm certainly willing to play more.

First of all, the acclaim for the components seems a little undeserved. The blocks are fine. The map is asthetically attractive if spare, and certainly functional. But the board has these huge seams which become a real issue with the little blocks if you happen to be in an area that traverses a seam. Its a great touch that the game comes with two copies of the rulebook. 

In terms of gameplay...Bonaparte at Marengo is far more fun and interesting to me than Hammer of the Scots. A lot of the diversity in HotS comes from dice and card drawing. In BaM, its all your own choices (and your opponents). I love that the battles are decided based ONLY on where they are fought and by which strength forces. The position, bluff and fog of war that the blocks provide is well-suited to the system.

I have doubts as to whether there is a lot of long-term replayability. Granted, I don't usually get to that many plays that it becomes an issue, but the scenario may start to feel a bit stale after some time. I'm really looking forward to the next game using this system...which may be just the solution. How nice to be able to just jump in and play, already knowing the rules.

An absolute masterpiece- one of the best wargames or boardgames I've ever played.  BaM captures not only the concepts and practices of Napoleonic linear warfare but also the importance of manuevering, flanking, and intelligent command in a suprisingly comprehensive package.  For all the folks who speak of "agonizing decisions" in Eurogames like Puerto Rico, try BaM and see how excruciating it can be to decide whether or not to assault- the attrition is brutal and if you make a critical mistake it can cost you the game.  The rules are fairly simple but somewhat poorly presented so the game has a pretty high learning curve when coupled with a unique system that asks the player to completely forget everything they thought they knew about wargames.  Tense, challenging, and brilliant- a game for the ages that deserves all the hype and praise it's recieved- Charles S. Roberts shoe-in!

Right now this game is only "good" and kind of boring.  I've only played three games so far, and it's taking me a while to understand the flow.

The game has a very chess-like feel to it. Which is strange because I do not care for chess at all, but really like this a lot. 

The pieces are wonderful wooden blocks that remind me of the look of an atlas of battles from the Napoleonic period. When the game is underway and the pieces set up it is really wonderful to behold.

I found that it took quite a while for me to get a decent grasp of the rules. I am not sure if it is the rulebook or just that the system is so very different from anything else I have played. I have completed several games now and I still know that I am far from perfect in my understanding of the rules. 

This game lends itself quite well to email play. 

My rating is based on about 2 complete and 2 partial playings of the game.

Compelling and totally innovative system, with good quality components. Takes only 30 minutes to learn, but requires a LOT of map study to see all the possible nuances here, so actual learning curve is rather steeper than might first be supposed. I found it hard to intuitively visualise areas on the map due to their extremely pale colour against the pale background, but after several plays this becomes less of a problem. However, I think future map design might look into making these more immediately visible, without them "overpowering" the overall period look of the map. Overall this is highly recommended, and I hope to see more Napoleonic battles using this system in future.

I can see why people would like this game.  It's very unique.  It takes a while to fully grasp the rules.  And at least one play to understand the strategy.  I might raise my rating after more plays.  But the complexity of the rules for new players keeps it a 7 for now.

RATING: 5
Played twice, and I rate the physical design very highly - Mr. Simmons has acheived the look he was going for.  I don't find the game very reminiscent of Napoleonic warfare however (at least in the books I've read); and there is no chaos on the battlefield (other than the randomized French at start), which is crucial in my view to the feel of the game.  I'd play it again as it is a tense and fast game but I rate Eagles of the Empire much better than this as a narrative generating game and as capturing the feel of Napoleonic combat (Again, as I've read it).

A remarkable design effort, managing to capture Napoleonic warfare in maneuver, result and atmosphere, yet doing so, somehow, in a remarkably abstract fashion.  The game in play is as close to "art" as I have seen, in forty years of conflict simulations.

A very elegant design and beautiful components.  At first I really didn't like it and thought it too dry but once I cracked it really took off.  Assault rules means that there are rarely head on attacks, plus the narrowness of the map limits overall strategy but still smashing.  Also, the Austrians really have a hard time winning against a French player who knows what he's doing.  Playable in 2 hours which is a plus.

Loads of fun to play, lots of replay value, and a very interesting attempt at simulating linear warfare.  The main problem is that it just can't replicate Marengo.  The other problem (for me) is that it just doesn't "feel" like a Napoleonic battle.  But it is a gas to play in its own right, so all historical sins are forgiven.  Oh, and watch out for those rules.  There are powerful and subtle concepts in there that you will just slide by even after a couple of readings.

Tentative rating after one play.
Bits are very aesthetic, but aren't very useful in practice (the map is hard to use and swapping pieces out when a loss is made is clunky). Our game was a bit of a stale meat-grinder with little maneuver. Hopefully that will change with future playings.
Innovative rules take some getting used to as well.

Category: Heavy, tactical wargame.

Unique, elegant system that structurally and visually captures the strategy and tactics around a single battle better than any game I've ever played: and it does it without dice, hexes or cards! Because it is a different system, it is a little heavier to get started and then strategically get your head around but that also contributes to the strategic freshness and challenge of play.

Brain-burner :-)  Combat is completely deterministic, but hidden information means you don't know what's going to happen until you reveal. Random French setup gives replayability. Need to be prepared to take some losses to gain information; Austrians can't waste too much time moving forwards.

Scored a slightly coffee-stained B@M mapboard from a friend and downloaded the rules from SG's site. Napoleon's Triumph provides the parts. Have only walked through this solo thus far, but it strikes me as quite a cool game. I was away from wargaming for far too long and this is such a change from the 1/2 inch counters and unreadable hexgrids of my youth...

Personally, I'd like to see Simmons Games offer a "Sorry you missed it before it went OOP" bundle of the B@M map with Napoleon's Triumph perhaps only through his website. Or even an unmounted paper version of the map (which could be reprinted at significantly lower cost I assume). Perhaps I was just the last person who waited too long to pick up the game, but I would think that there's a market for that....

BaM is an incredibly innovative design. It's tight, balanced, and captures the flavour and tactics of linear warfare in exactly the way that so many other games have failed.

BaM's failing is the limited possibilities - you're retelling the same story each time, and the interest is in the nuances. Napoleon's Triumph, on the other hand, casts a very long shadow and mostly eclipses it's little brother.

RATING: 7
Different wargame in terms of look and mechanics.  Long wooden pieces (like Settlers of Catan roads) hide the type and strength of your troops from your opponent  - akin to Columbia block games.  These pieces move across an area movement map, with the areas containing 3 or more entry "approaches" that you can block up with troops in line.  Alternatively, you can keep your troops in reserve in an area, which allow more tactical flexibility, but they become more vunerable to attack.  Terrain effects are elegantly printed on the map, and combat is simply strength differentials with the terrain factored in.  No dice in sight.  Elegant, fast playing, different.  You think about roads, flanks, gaps - and not about bean counting of factors.   The game ends when one side is demoralised, or at the end of the day when the Austrians are judged on what territory they control.  Excellent and enjoyable game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Innovative, compelling, and totally fresh game. Maneuver and movement are everything, and it takes seval turns of marching men about before you give the painful order to assault. You find yourself immersed in the period's military realities, accounting for marching out columns on various roads, concerned with teh placement of your few critical elite units, and becoming leery of the perils of a headlong charge unless necessary. And that's just the system! The specific tactical situation is a great challenge for both sides! I cannot recommend this instant classic highly enough.

Very clever game, and one of the best wargames I've played in years. With the generic units and diceless combat, it sometimes seems more like a classic strategy game than a wargame. For me, the "road movement" rules are the only sore spot.

The board is unclear in spots but the production is otherwise pretty good.

Bought it and played it one time.  It was fun and the mechanics were refreshing, but I think ultimately the fact that it was all tied to just one scenario and not a whole system that could be played out in a variety of maps just made it uninspiring to me.  With the prices on ebay I went ahead and sold it.

The march and movement rules are a complete muddle.  As another commenter put it, you're never sure that you're actually playing it right.  Just look at all the posted clarifications here in BGG.

The presentation is top notch, and the approach is very novel.  Unfortunately, the game play just doesn't live up to the promise.  

This game is, at heart, a bad choice of battle. Marengo is a fluid meeting engagement, a kind of running fight. This system would (maybe) work better with a more setpiece battle, Borodino or Waterloo, where you wouldn't be screwing with the unworkable march rules all the time.

Clean and elegant wargame system. Credit must be given to Bowen Simmons for coming up with a game system that's innovative, effective and visually appealing to boot. The game plays quickly, but maybe too quickly. There's no real sense of tough decisions to make in the game, no knife in the gut sort of thing. That may have to do with the tactical situation, which presents a more limited action. NT, simulating a set-piece battle, gives a wider scope of strategy for players.

Rating 5 going on 10.  There is no luck in this game except for a minimal amount in the initial French setup.  The rules are not too long but are extremely complex.  The result is an intense game that has many of the attributes of Chess.  Mistakes in the opening moves can have catastrophic consequences.  Multiple plays are needed to get skilled at the game i.e to learn the pattern of moves that work.  It is very unforgiving.  One boob toward the end of the game can result in inevitable loss.   Ambivalent about this game.  Clearly a labor of love.  Lots of work has gone into it, but it requires a large dedication of gaming time to feel one is playing it to the level required.  Rating 5 because if I want to play Chess, I play Chess.

One of the most innovative and elegant block-style games ever made.  The map and pieces are highly evocative of diagrams in classic texts on the period and the system is quite unusual, relying on the fog of war to create high levels of uncertainty so that no dice are needed to resolve combats.  The situation is a classic one in wargames as one side attacks and then defends, while the other defends and then attacks.  Physical quality of this game is among the highest and yet is very reasonably priced.  A real value and very highly recommended.

Provisional rating.  I feel the game works well, it is a clean compact design even though I had a horrible time remembering the intricacies of maneuvering into and out of locale and defense positions.  What bothers me might actually the lack of randomness (apart from the setup) which eventually may lead to a scripted outcome.  To win, the Austrians must do X, thus the French should counter with Y, and henceforth we have slight variations of X&Y.  A few more games should clarify my grasp of the game and balance my overall appreciation.

Rating after first play--I'm floored by just how innovative this design is.  It's really amazing.  Finally a wargame with more emphasis on formations and maneuver rather than dice-chucking and hex counting.

Too often wargames come down to manipulating your odds to the best possible ratio, chucking some dice, and that was how "the west was won."  Flanking just meant "Hey, I snuck up a fat lot of my dudes on both sides of your mens."

Here, flanking really means something.  I can tie up your forces with a frontal assault when BOOM my cavalry does a maneuver attack from their flank, putting them in disarray, whittling down their troops, and forcing them to retreat, pushing them in the opposite direction of the assault and the flank.  Brutal!

And many wargames are all about just piling your men into a defensible square and letting attrition do the work for you.  In BaM, because of the limitations of the fronts, you can't bring all your military to bear at once.  Like lines or waves, only your front can actually do battle.  An inferior force with a strong lead can take advantage of this and do far more damage than you'd expect.

Bowen's notes on this game are pretty awesome to read...he began by envisioning an aesthetic--one that eschewed most typical wargame aesthetics--and in the process he came up with a type of game that simply didn't exist before.

It's too abstract for some, but given his target rules complexity I think it does a fantastic job of putting together a great system with some incredible rules economy.  Brilliant, brilliant game.

I'd like to think this represents the future of wargaming, or at least I hope so.  I haven't been this excited about a game since I first cracked open War of the Ring.

This is a game that requires a thorough understanding of the rules and there is a not insignificant learning curve involved.  After that, not unlike chess (which this wargame has frequently been related to) it helps to play someone on a similar skill level.

The markings that define the various locales are somewhat difficult to discern and the movement rules are challenging at best.

Deterministic "combat"; boring abstract maneuver which does not at all capture the ebb and flow of this historical battle. Comes down to units being trapped at an artificially-created board edge.

RATING: 5
This is a diceless Napoleonic block wargame.

The entire board is divided into areas and each area is differed by penalties to either or(both) infantry, cavalry and arty or restricted movement etc.

PROS:

1. Very excellent production values, nice longish blocks, nice mounted board. Very nice art which gives the feel of how the battle would have been plotted by napoleon's general's

2. Interesting diceless mechanic for resolving combat.

3. Nicely balanced for both sides.

4. Easy to learn and play, can be played in two-three hours.

CONS:

1. The diceless mechanic can turn off a lot of wargamers. Kinda feels chesslike.

2. I found that most of the time, battles turn into two huge piles of blocks attacking each other(as long as the area can support that number of blocks).

TACTICS:

Austrians: You have the advantage at the start that all of your forces start in the game, use your numerical superiority over the French at the start to push towards your goal areas and kill French units before his reinforcements come in.

Remember to watch your casualties as each step you lose, the more you become demoralized.

French: Always try to retreat, you can trade space for time enough for your reinforcements to come in, don't be afraid to attack if the Austrians become overstretched.

You win if the Austrians don't get their goal areas.

The best luckless combat system around because victory is not total; even if you win a fight you still lose men.

Also this game is beautiful to behold. I wish there was a little more chrome, like rules for Desaix, but alas you can't have it all!

This is one of those games in my collection that I've long wanted to play but the opportunity never offered, so having a friend show up out of the blue to knock on my door and say, "Let's play Bonaparte at Marengo" was as wonderful as it was unlikely; about the only thing that could make it better would be for a half-naked woman to do the same thing (or if three of them asked to play Friedrich). But with that kind of anticipation, the game was bound to disappoint. I do like the mechanics, and once you get your head wrapped around the differences between assault and maneuver combat, with the varyng consequences of units being in reserve or on the line, the combat ticks right along. But I found the map a bit difficult to read, and with the unit blocks having to face a number of different directions to conform to the blocking positions on the map, it wasn't always easy to see at a glance what was where (as compared to a Columbia block game, where everything can face directly toward the player). In my game I smashed the French down to within one point of demoralization, but couldn't close the deal before night fell; I had some fun doing it, but my French opponent was on the run the whole game and I don't think it was all that much fun for him. Doubtless future plays would reveal strategies and tactics not immediately obvious, but the design was bloodless enough that I traded it before it ever got back to the table for another go. Feelings of regret at giving up on the system too early were assuaged by later trying and entirely disliking Napoleon's Triumph. The system is just not for me!

2005 acquisition.  Have not given a rating as I've only played a solo game so far and don't think I'm ready to give a rating yet.  I just couldn't get my head around the rules for some reason, and I had some difficulty tracking the road movement limit.  Must read some rule clarification to clear my mind up.  Guess that's always the case when playing solo for the first time.  Maybe I'm just getting too old for this.

Anyway, despite that, the game appears to be a serious brain burner.  There was so much I could to do but I was restricted by the command limit.  I haven't had a good grasp of the strategy yet but it appears that manoeuvering the troops and encirculating the enemy may be a better strategy than direct confrontation as otherwise you usually come off worse being the attacker.

In terms of the quality of the game components, they are of fantastic quality and simply beautiful to behold.  One reservation about the game board, though, is that in the smaller locales, there is simply inadequate room to put both the pieces blocking the approach and the reserve pieces within the space provided.

Must play again.  After 1 solo play, I'm certain that it is not a SO-friendly game, at least not mine anyway.

Finally got to play it properly (still have some confusion at times with the road rules).  I can't wait to play it again.

This game is very similar to NT, practically no difference at all. It has far less options about the lines of attack, and less nuanced victory conditions. The rigid logic seems far more intractable in this game as well. I could see a rookie being intimidated and getting frustrated.

I like Napoleonic and I like wargames. 

This is very innovative. The map is a strange point-to-point variant. The minimalist no dice, no tables approach is intended to make the game fast moving. 

There aren't dice or cards to introduce that type of surprise randomness. The uncertainty comes from not knowing what is in your opponents blocks and second guessing what your opponent might do next.

On the down side I don't think it has too much replay value.

At the start the Austrians are a bit boxed in. They have to break out of this narrow front line. It gets more interesting as the game progresses and the front line gets more extended.

Poor: Tactical - Napoleonic - Easy 

Rating says probably more about me than about the game but Idon't get it. OCS is easier for me to play and understand than this game and whe I thought I played right it turned out it eas not the case. Alone I can't master it, nor my game group members. We need help from an experienced player to teach us live but unfortunately we don't have one around.  

Plus:
-Innovative
-Accessible
-Time
-Quality components 

Minus:
-See comments Napoleon's Triumph. Need help from experience dplayer.
-Not sure how it holds up over time
-Original system but very unintuitive. Constantly had a feeling it it was right what I was doing. Over time I did nog get used to it and am still on the fence as far as Napoleon's Triumph is concerned.

Yes it is innovative but not for me.

Revisited: I notice I haven't touched this one for a long time and the desire to play again is unfortunately missing. Lowered my rating accordingly. 

Sold it.

Played a few times so far.  Good game, some scripted ideas of play for the austrians.  Depending on how experienced a player is, the game can be easy or hard.  A fighting withdrawl (which is what I think the French need to do) is hard for most people to pull off, especially as a beginner.

RATING: 7
A highly original block wargame, the product of a genuinely intelligent mind. Unfortunately the designer's IQ is not matched by his ability to communicate, making the rule book a hard slog (Napoleon's Triumph is worse again), so be sure to download Koryo's reworded rules. It's important to have all the details right as this is a tight-scoring game. It's essential that the Austrians go in with a plan, they need to pick a point of attack and assault it repeatedly with 3-strength units until they break through. I like the idea here, but always end up wanting to like this a lot more than I actually do, partly because of impenetrable rules and partly because it's fundamentally a very dry system. A little randomness always makes things a bit more exciting. As with all recreations of a single battle, there's a limit on how many times you can play before it becomes repetitive. The cleverness on display here does nothing to remove that essential limit.

BaM is certainly a very deep, thinker's game.  One has to manage the larger picture while balancing the smaller tactical nuances to prove an effective player.  Making mistakes proves very costly.  If one neglects to protect a flank, over or under-reinforces a blockade, spreads troops too thinly, or clumps units too tightly s/he can and will be taken advantage of.  I can't say enough about the game; it is extremely well designed and evokes a wargaming elegance that I have yet to see be matched.

Bowen Simmons has a true winner here.  The game is a fascinating study in game design and linear warfare.  The key is maneuver and using your assets more appropriately than your opponent.

RATING: 7
Stunningly innovative wargame, featuring block-like wooden rectangles as units, and an area map where units can be positioned either within the area proper ("in reserve") or along one of the area's approaches. Add to this a diceless *and* CRT-less combat system (!) and you have a game where the designer really has been thinking out of the box. Short playing time and managable rules make for a very elegant game.

Now, my rating - admittedly based on only a single game - might seem on the low side based on the above description, but while I liked the game it didn't blow me away. The diceless combat system felt a bit dry and colorless and the whole game felt quite abstract, almost chess-like. I did like the emphasis on maintaining lines and the all-importance of getting around the enemy's flank, though.

The game plays OK, but after a few runs, there doesn't seem much for the French player to do except defend and, maybe, small attacks or assaults if the Austrian player has misplayed.  I doubt that an aggressive Austrian player can lose this game, especially with the random Fench set-up.  How does this game get such a high rating?!?

And, game play be damned... just try to play this game in low light. The pastel markings on the map disappear.  You need a flashlight to check area limits or penalties... not much fun.  Why couldn't they have printed the approaches in black!

I'll give this game a 7 for game play... but because of the components, it only rates a 5.

Regular standup square wooden blocks would have been preferable to the little wooden sticks.  The size of some of the game areas almost demands it.

A solid and interesting game that does a good job of thinking outside the box on how to tackle what it wants to model.  The scenario chosen does a good job of deflecting perfect plans and obvious openings, which helps deepen the replay value.  It has one of the finest treatments of cavalry I've ever seen and the system definitely works.  If I have a complaint about it (and I'm reaching a little), it's that your plans can feel a little too secure against frontal attacks, but this is an intellectual rather than gameplay problem.  I also wind up liking it more each time I play it, which is a good thing!

One of the best wargames I have played.  The no-luck combat resolution is inspired.  More than almost any other game, maneuver is crucial.  If the French do not stay mobile, they are doomed.  The components have a distinctive look modeled, according to the designer, on maps of the period.  I found some of the board markings a bit faint for comfort, though.   The rules are clear and largely unambiguous even when explaining tricky concepts like the limits on road movement.  Designer is very good about answering questions on BaM's CSW forum.

FINALLY got to play this gem.  It's odd, so different from other games.  It's REALLY not a good idea to attack, at least as the French.

RATING: 4
(Note: this rating was an 8 until I played [gameid=18098]; now, I would always want to play that instead.)

Nobody I know is really into Napoleonics, so the only way I get people to play this is by insisting they try it.  Even after, I don't know, half a dozen games, I feel like there are some basic ways of mounting an attack which will become clear to me after a few more plays.  (It still seems like I have to spend too much thought on how many commands it will take to do something, or how to do something without screwing up, rather than what I want to get done with my commands.)  I suspect my rating would go up if I were playing this more regularly, or with an opponent who actually wanted to play.

The first time I played this was with jwboone at BGG.CON '05; I didn't care for it too much because it seemed like 80% of my thought was spent on figuring out how to make my guys walk down the road as efficiently as possible.  (Not because of the road movement rules, but because he kept blocking me with cavalry and then running away.)  But he told me to give it another try, and I'm glad I did.

Update: man, I think I just don't get this game.  After maybe a dozen plays, I introduced it to a new player; he insisted on no handicap, and I only barely squeaked out a win.  It seems like I should have crushed him!

One other thing about this game is, [i]everyone[/i] I've talked into playing it has been lukewarm about it, unsure whether they were actually having fun.  If you're introducing this to someone, make them promise to play it twice!

Update: I must be doing [i]something[/i] right; in my first ladder match, the French conceded after my 1PM turn... on the next turn they would have been at 1 morale, to my 14.

Update: after playing [gameid=18098], I don't think I will play this anywhere but in the ladder tournament.  See [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/1919920#1919920]here[/url]  for one of the lists of things I like better about NT.

RATING: 6
[Original] Bonaparte at Marengo (or, BaM for short) is a welcome departure from the typical block wargame. The game board (map) and the playing pieces, when combined, recreate a living battle map of the 19th century. In this game, one player controls the attacking Austrians (red), while the other controls Napoleon's French brethren (blue). These red and blue game pieces, hidden from your opponent's eyes, represent infantry, cavalry, and artillery units. Moving the game pieces on the board is the key to winning (or losing) this game. When the inevitable battle is joined, it is resolved simply, yet elegantly, in a luckless system. Although the initial setup of the French units (the only random portion of the game) helps keep the game fresh play-after-play, the game's victory conditions do limit the scope of what each player can do during the game. Despite this, one of the best features of this game is that there is an active online gaming community which plays BaM via Cyberboard (with the blessing of the game's designer, Bowen Simmons). Join the online community and play Bonaparte at Marengo to experience the thrill of victory (or the agony of defeat)!

[2007.May.13] If it wasn't for the limits/constraints on each players' strategy, I would rate this game even higher. (Here's to hoping that Bowen Simmons releases a variant for this game adjusting the victory conditions, and thereby the strategies available to the players.)

Excellent game -- VERY unique wargame that is elegant in both appearance and play.  Decisions are tense and the fog of war effect works better even than in the Columbia Games I've played.  I've only played as the Austrians so far but I enjoy the asymmetrical forces with different victory conditions.  My only (slight) gripe is that the game lacks a certain intangible "fun" factor that is probably a result of the diceless combat.

Just played it.  Not a bad one but nothing to write home about either.  The mapboard is hardmounted, bringing you back to the good old days where wargames are supposed to look like.  The use of "chit-like" block, military-look sketch map based on the actual terrain and the concept of reserves and blocking/ assaulting are some of the special features of this game.  Napoleon is on the defensive side this time...not something he was used to. The Austrain are in red while the French are in blue.  No combat result table is required as combat is resolved purely on strength differential.  No DRMs either.  So resolving battle is fast and players can get concentrated on the manouver part.

RATING: 8
Rated after one VASSAL game which was a learning game for both players, so this is a highly provisional rating. While the first half of the game was rather shaky as we untangled the rules, once we got the basics down, the game started to flow, and BaM's potential began to peek through.

While there are a few edge cases in the rules, and the organization of the rulebook is less than optimal for either learning or reference, overall BaM is an elegant design that offers interesting strategy and tactics with a moderate learning curve. The approach-based movement and combat give BaM a feel that is different from other wargames, even other area movement games. The fact that only one unit/piece participates in an assault for each side seems a bit odd at first, but when you think about it a bit it makes more sense due to the relatively short time-scale (one hour per turn).

Overall, an interesting game that does a nice job of capturing the feel of Napoleonic tactical warfare. I look forward to playing again, and may even buy a copy eventually if replayability holds up. I am also interested to see what subsequent design in this line are like.

With BaM you get a strategical hardcore wargame without the typical wargame chrome. There are new and inovative mechanics. To get the most out of the game you should be aware of this: The rules are cruel to get. Much more examples would have been good. For your first game I recommend that both players should have read the rules. There are no luck elements in this game but I would not call it dry. The game is more about clever manoeuvering than direct confrontations.  To get a feeling for the game you need 2 or 3 test games. All in all you get a hard but intense wargaming experience for about 3 hours.

RATING: 4
Extremely clever and innovative game; I love the physical presentation, blocks and areas (although the map is a bit too light).  Good rendition of some of the basic tactical principles (falling back from a fight is possible but risky). And fog of war, too!!! What's not to like!  Well...Unfortunately it does not particularly feel like Marengo to me, and seems to have a simple, effective, and ahistorical perfect French plan.  Nor does it really feel like a Napoleonic battle, with groups of units wandering across the battlefield, separating and regrouping at will.   

We'll see how this works for Austerlitz.  I can see the system as being extremely effective for Eurogamers (or people who don't really look at how well actual play reflects history).

Update: 8. Still a great game, but it doesn't really hit the table. 

9: A really well balanced and tense game. It really gives the feel of the flanking, cavalry-charging, artillery-firing, armies-on-the-road, carefully maneuvering, steady line of assaulting soldiers that was war in the Napoleonic era. Great balance between the two sides and many opportunities for exploring strategic possibilities for each army. Rating down from 10 on account of its successor, Napoleon's Triumph.

Beautiful components but poor combats system. No leadership involve with a superficial command structure. Without either units moral, terrain effect, troops quality involved in defence during combats. The Imperial Guard is equal in defense to the worst Allies unit. Need a good old combats table and a bit of luck with the help of some dices. A chess game with artificial Napoleonic favor.  Conclusion; a good game but a average simulation.

RATING: 9.9
Innovative wargame.  The rules are slim but the resulting gameplay deep, so as a result you're struggling against your opponent, not the game.

Upon further face-to-face and email play, I've upped my rating from 8 to 9.  Once the rules become second nature, seeing the board and all the possibilities for maneuver really make the game deeply exciting.  I look forward to further play.

Upon still further FTF and PBEM play, I've upped it again, to 9.9.  I don't rate anything 10, as I have no idea if I'll [b][i]always[/i][/b] "always want to play" (I use the default BGG rating system) any game.  However, BaM has become my favorite game, so it'll get my symbolic "9.9".  I haven't been this excited about a game, especially after so many months and plays, in a long time.  The elegance of such a (relatively) simple set of rules for a linear warfare game is brilliant.  Not only a great game for wargamers, but (in my limited experience) a great wargame for euro and abstract game player who normally wouldn't try a "wargame".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Pros:
- Completely innovative war game system
- The way the map affects the gameplay is amazing
- The dramatic moments always seem to play out differently
- Great narrative flow (the beginning, middle, and end of the game all feel and play differently) so it doesn't stagnate

Cons:
- The scenario constrains the strategic options

My one problem with this game is that the French appear to have a single viable strategy, which is to retreat as quickly as possible and to resist the Austrian offensive as little as possible. The game is still a blast within those strategic constraints, but it would have been nicer to have some alternate paths to victory.

I made a Cyberboard game box for this game. Check it out at the BaM Ladder website (see the links on the game page).

Miss this and you will regret it! Great game and presentation value cannot be exceeded easily. My main concern (not giving 9/10) is that game does not really simulate very well the french counter attack. In many games we played, counter attack is merely visible as giving reinforcements to the defenders. There is rarely a need to really counter attack.

A very interesting game.  A lot of thought has obviously been invested here and I am pleased with the results.  Moving the pieces to the sides of the areas and having others in reserve, terrain effects _between_ hexes listed on their side facing... All very intriguing.  The only thing I dislike so far is that there are no dice and I don't know whether a block game is appropriate for Napoleonics.  Whether that is true or not doesn't matter, this game is a lot of fun.

01/08/06 Played once (and I’m pretty sure never again). Nice components. Clever design. Yet a bit too clever for me.

A novel and interesting game system that takes some getting used too.  Great fun, very tense.  Not sure how accurate it is as a "simulation" of the battle.

I really like this game - but it drives me crazy.  The system is simple and elegant but the possible interactions between unit type, board location and move type actually leads to a far more complex game than it first appears.  A classic "simple to learn but hard to master" game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Game uses blocks and area movement to duplicate the familiar "look" of 19th century battle maps, with red and blue bars showing troop movements. The visual conventions here are a clever bit of bait and switch that replaces the player's artificial Olympian perspective gazing down upon the battlefield with a graphic experience most players will recognize from the historical literature they have already spent many pleasurable hours poring over. That this is done self-consciously, with reference to a tradition that dates back to the original Kriegspiel, only makes the result more satisfying.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Austria is trying to breakthrough France's lines to capture specific areas on the board or demoralize them before the day is over.  France who starts with less troops is trying to bide its time by tying up the Austrian troops and falling back when necessary until their reinforcements arrive.  

It plays very much like an abstract game.  The way troops engage each other through the approaches is quite unique and the combat system and movement mechanics, once learned, are fairly straight forward but with a large number of fascinating tactical scenarios that are not initially apparent.  You need to rely on smart manoeuvres since combat is very expensive (the winner always loses at least one troop) and although the Austrians outnumber the French the time clock really puts pressure on them which can find them moving desperately forward in formations that the French can exploit.

Just a fantastic game. No dices in here, only fog of war. The rules are not too heavy (in fact they are easy once you get the stuff like road movement) but could be written better. The game system is very interesting with strong French units in the beginning, but soon surrounded by the Austrians and later (if the French were able to survive) it turns upside down. Higly recommended!

This was the first serious wargame I had played in many years, and it was a real eye-opener. Stripped down to the bare bones, this is a challenging, tough game that I failed to grasp at first, and as my inevitable defeat became obvious I started to see how I could have done better. Revisiting the game saw us resolve some rules errors, and now we have  much closer, and more challenging battles. Good stuff!

Only played 1 solo game so far but am very impressed with the unique look and feel of the game.

I'm sure the rating will increase when play a proper 2 player game.

My initial impression after one solo & one FTF play: BaM has "the look" of Napoleanic warfare more than the feel (-duck-).  The game is chess-like in play with simple rules but deep play.  It's very difficult to recover from a bad move.  My rating may go up with after a few more plays.

The initially steep learning curve hides the fact that this game has fairly simple rules (after one play of bewilderment they just click). The difficulty comes from using the rules to develop a winning strategy with all the emphasis on manoeuvring, formations, making the most of the terrain and exploiting enemy weak points.  An innovative and streamlined war game, slightly abstract, but with an unique and great historical look.

I have played BaM a number of times now, and I find it to be one of the most fascinating and enjoyable games I have seen or played.  The execution is nuanced but sensible, and fully adheres to the so-called 'look' of linear warfare that was the prime design objective.

I sense an imbalance in favor of the French, but playing either side is compelling...game balance is not an issue in this case.  My only gripe (minor) is that there is very limited desirability for the French to choose a counterattack for territorial advantage, which is counter-intuitive to me...playing to the victory conditions of the game does not fully represent the ebb and flow of the historical choices made.

Overall, the best gaming experience I have had in years.

Two trial games. Looks like the Austrians need to be very aggressive to attrite the French and break their line. The French may need to fall back with the initially activated frontline units to achieve 'concentration', disengaging is very difficult. The Austrian artillery unit is exceedingly destructive. The French need to play for time to run out and to be aware that simultaneous demoralization is a goal to strive for. The only random elements in the game are the actual French initial force distributions; this might lead to rather scripted games. The rules are not intuitive but seem to be a construct of exceptions, just did not resonate.

Inflated rating; real rating probably a 6; I'm not into wargames, especially those about conflicts I don't care about.

I should have played this game before Napoleon's Triumph, not the other way around. Once I played this game, I immediately understood the basic premises:

* Don't assault unless you know you will win
* Weaken your opponent before assaulting with maneuvering attacks (force your opponent to block approaches around a locale to dilute and spread out his forces, then attack the locale)
* Use calvary to discover where your opponent's "3-strengh" units are, because this is what wins assaults. Also they are great for maneuvering attacks.
* Use artillery as well to weaken your opponent's forces. Use frequently and cautiously.

So the inflated rating is because I expected to be as frustrated as when I played NT, but instead BaM was a game of exploration.

I need to play this one more.  I really love the mechanic, look and feel of this one.  The rules are a little muddled in my opinion over the use of calvary, and in order to get full enjoyment out of this one both players really need to understand how the three types of units interact with each other.  If that where the case I'd rate it a ten!  Fantastic game though and the visual quality of the set adds to the enjoyment of play!

Initial comment:  Seems to hold promise as a good game.  But as a simulation?  As a wargame, as I conceive of 'wargame?'  Pretty weak, and I don't know anything about the battle.  The rules specify that the French set-up is random; Fog of War is too extreme, allowing players to shuffle pieces within a locale and re-cover them after they had been revealed in a battle.  Uh, c'mon man, the forces are standing right in front of one another!  Are you telling me that I can't see that you have INF there?  How did they magically switch places with that CAV, without my troops having seen it?  

Seems like it will be a cool-ass game, but I'm not about to take it seriously as a simulation.

After Play: This game just isn't for me.  Maybe at the right time, with the right person.  Maybe I need someone who is fluent in the game to teach me.  I dunno.  When it comes down to it the game never grabbed me...it just looked cool.  

Sold.

 My immediate impression was a 10.  But I wanted to wait until repeated playings of it to see if I would change my mind.  A truly remarkable game.  After numerous plays and then a big layoff this past year, I have finally settled on this as an 9. One drawback is that it is very difficult if not impossible to recreate the "historical battle." The more one reads the history of the battle, the more one realizes the difficulty of the game achieving that final historical climax that made the actual battle so dramatic. Overall, however, it is terrific game that gives a nice visual representation ("the look") of a Napoleonic battle. 

If you get the opportunity to make a copy of Mattia's antique map, it really enhances the playing experience.  It is so beautiful that I only the play the game now on that map! 

Edited July 2015
The total impossibility of recreating any historical result of the actual battle has left me cold over the years, so am finally downgrading my rating. It is still a very good game, more like chess, rather than an historical simulation, and as an abstract game chess is better.

It breaks my old golden rule "no luck is no fun". Even if it's diceless this is an excellent game, with superior component value: mounted map (very high quality). Wooden block units, when placed on the map offer that unique charming look. A touch of class: 2 copies of rulebook included.

One thing that should be mentioned: there is an impressive amount of informations on the well designed website, very interesting.

Rating based on initial play.  There is a learning curve to this game and I suspect that as I learn to play the game the rating will increase.  But the learning curve is a bit more difficult then say Hammer of the Scots - a game I immediately wanted to play again after my first play.  This game didn't grab me just as yet.  I can see the potential and will reread the rules - but admit to having a hard time seeing how the pieces coordinate their actions together.  Once I see that, rating might improve.

3 plays. I'm not sure where I fall on this one yet. I'm positive I'm missing something so I'm sure the rating will go up.

Update: Yes, I was missing something. Played with the correct rules the game was tense, exciting, fast, and seemed quite balanced. Certainly a unique keeper. I still missed the excitement and interesting problems and risks posed by dice, hence my lower rating. Not a knock on the game, just a personal preference.

The rules were clear enough and some downloaded aids helped. Gameplay's a yawner, though. After 2-3 plays it would be done and the rating drop to a 3. Other wargamers' comments in the 1-4 ratings represent my thoughts on the gameplay and history.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Gripping game of strategy with excellent production values, a short rulebook (two copies are provided), and a nice quick play time (90 minutes). The blocks are tiny, like Settlers roads, whereas the board is a rather large eightfold mounted map (sadly with American valleys between the folds, otherwise very good). The whole package  is top notch, and a bargain considering what you get in the box (all of the above, plus enough spare blocks to roll your own scenarios and variants).

Rather than direct combat, the game emphasises flanking attacks and road movement. During a game you'll visit almost every locale on the board as the battle progresses from the river in the north to the objective towns in the south.

Playing the game got me interested in the battle itself, so I got a copy of  'Napoleon as Military Commander' by James Marshall-Cornwall, and this gave me a fresh apreciation for the game. The basic history of the day is that Napoleon was camped in the southwest corner of the map (on the objective stars!), and received bad intelligence indicating that there was no river crossing (on the north of the map). That being the case, he sent out parties to the south and west to try and locate the Austrian forces. As the battle / game begins, the northern bridge is in place (plus the pontoon bridge), and the Austrians are streaming towards Napoleon's poorly defended HQ while he frantically recalls his scattered forces.

If you're a euro gamer who's been unsure whether to give it a try, I say go for it -- it feels more like a themed abstract than a wargame. My pick for the game of the year 2005.

Rating likely to go up after a few more plays.

Update: Well, I think this is going to sit at a 9 for me for the forseeable future. The road movement is fiddly enough to keep it from ten-dom.

Update: Shaved a point off the rating. It's a great unique game, but the lack of scenarios keep it from joining Rommel in the Desert in the wargame pantheon.

Update: Still enjoying it, and getting more out of the game as I memorise more of the rules. It's such a compelling battle and such an interesting game package. This is one of the few games I would never trade away.

OK, I've sat down and taught myself how to play. I've gone through 3 transcripts of games (thanks Fagin! But can I have some more??). Then I played my first game as the Austrians. I lost it because I made 2 massive rookie mistakes where I didn't block approaches (which I could have done freely) and let him perform unblockable maneouvre attacks on me the next turn, which made me waste at least 2-3 hours being pushed back, and I lost my artillery from the retreat as well.The game is very intellectual, quite dry, and pretty challenging. I love the setup time! It takes less than a minute to get it out of the box and Austria taking their first move. I put all of France's starting pieces in one bag with all the Austrian ones. Austria can grab the 4 starting units he wants and can just sort out the rest of his reinforcement pieces while France is taking his first move.The rules are elegantly simple. After a few turns of moving on roads, or retreating and maneouvre attacking with the different units, and you know all the ins and outs of the system.So in summary, I think that the game is very good. I just don't know if its the right kind of game for me. On my first play I didn't know if it was going to sustain my interest for 2-3 hours, but it did. I just don't know if I really *enjoyed* those 2-3 hours. I'll see once I've played a couple more times and gotten better and quicker at playing. I definitely learnt a lot from my first game.

OK, I've started my first PBEM game on CyberBoard and I've bumped up my rating to a 9. The game length can be really quick with 2 players who have the rules down (which isn't that hard at all), and the amount of tactical and strategic depth you get out of a game this quick and elegant is fantastic.

I won my first PBEM game :). I shouldn't have really, he just made one mistake (his first in whole game I think), and didn't retreat some units to the right spot to stop my last turn dive at the objectives.

My first play was great. There is a lot to learn and then lots to do! A little difficult to wrap my brain around some of the rules, like road movement and the different attacks.  After a few more plays I bump it up to a solid 8. May even go higher yet! May 2006, bumped to a 9. I am playing this via e-mail and usually have 3-5 games going at once. I will have more than 20 games of this in 2006. I have over 30 plays now in early 2008. This game will have staying power, but I think Napoleon's Triumph will cut the number of plays.

Half an hour in, and I had already learned so much about how to fight a Napoleonic battle.  Simply brilliant in its transparency, the only flaw I can think of after my first play is that it might not hold up to dozens of playings - but until then, I plan to get my money's worth.

UPDATE: I'll be honest, the release of Napoleon's Triumph has nudged this one down the list quite a bit.

As a "euro-gamer" expanding my horizons into war gaming I've found BaM very approachable and fun.  I cannot speak to its historical accuracy or its accuracy in terms of recreating battle field tactics and manuever, but its as engaging and challenging as a good euro without all the "fiddly" chrome that kept me away from wargames thus far.

Nov 05 Update - After six plays, I find myself not as eager to play this. Due to the abstract nature of the game, the final result appears to come down more to who makes the first "mistake."  Still a very nice design, and will probably play it from time to time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Visually stunning recreation of Marengo. Players move flat blocks representing Cavalry, Infantry and Artillery around the board. There are movement rules as well as attack rules. Each player is limited to 3 moves a turn and Either side wins by either demoralising the opponent. Additionally, the Austrians win by taking certain locales and the French just needs to prevent them from doing so.

Terrain plays a great part in the game. Once you wrap your head around the various possible movement and terrain rules, the game plays quickly and is highly tactical...almost like a game of chess, albeit with limited information. There is some bluff and a good memory is useful.

Very quirky but playable game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
early rating of solo play: Deeelicious! this game is a brain burner disguised in beautiful, simple components. with its cousin, NT, they're the prettiest games in my collection. 

in fact, the game's understated beauty hides the fact that it's a legit con-sim. instead of tedious TEM and fire-power charts and the masses of counters associated with normal hex-and-counter wargames, we get all of that gracefully and cleverly incorporated into a gorgeous map that's pleasurable to look at and wood blocks that are nice to touch. hats off to Simmons Games for shattering the mold.

is it too abstract? maybe. but in many ways, the abstraction feels just right. once you grasp the rules, it seems all too simple. but the depth is in the map--the terrain--and how to utilize it. 

of the wargames i've played, this one most naturally portrays the concept of "good ground". you look at the map, studying the lay of the land like a field officer would. it's a triumph of cartography and information design.

the simplicity of the game (again, once you get the rules) lends itself to repeated play. and similar to Chess (or, hell, Carcasonne) it plays easily after an extended period on the shelf. 

the game is a refined, slow-simmer. like when baseball is played well. each move becomes increasingly critical as the game approaches its final turn.

if i could get more f2f in, this might be a 10. even solo, it packs about everything i most appreciate in game design: easy & fast setup, beautiful art direction, low rules weight, brain-burning decisions, etc. all of this even before the poker element of f2f.

Wow, what a brain burner.  It is very easy to feel befuddled while trying to figure out what the hell to do next.  The major roads!  Remember to use the major roads!

This is a pretty ingenious system, and a real joy to watch unfold.  Clearly everything is there to make it a war game, but the level of percision of absolute force and response based on symbols makes this feel much more like an abstract to me. For me the way it plays out ends up feeling more like Hex or Twixt than a war game.

With novice players it seems a little too easy for France to delay long enough through Cavalry retreats.  I assume it becomes more balanced with more plays.  

A couple pros:
1.  Simmons games gives two rule books, which is appreciated.  This is just typical of how much attention the company gives the customer.  Very impressive.
2.  The game length is very managable which makes it come out a little more than some of my other favorite two player wargames (Hammer of the Scots for example.)  
3.  The map design is both innovative and visually appealing (I did not expect this from the pictures of the game - it is really quite nice looking.)

Because I don't feel the 'rush', even at the end of a long-planned, successful crushing maneuver.  It doesn't come alive; you are not there.  It's just a beautiful, delicious brainbender.

After a few plays I still think the game is GREAT.  Easy to explain (for a wargame)(and at least the basic rules that is) to newbies and so much strategy!  My only complaint is that the strategic learning curve is pretty steep for new players, but I guess it is easy to handicap yourself in this game (adjust the morale) so that's ok too.

I like all the potential for maneuvering...in this area I'd say the game even improves on its successor Napoleon's Triumph.

BaM does feel more abstract though.

RATING: 6.5
Conceptually brilliant, the game suffers from some flaws in the map where there are essentially zones that you cannot traverse for no apparent reason.  This is definitely a quality game, but it is more of a niche production in that it will appeal strongly to fans of musket combat and will not even be close to intuitive or natural to someone who is accustomed to the movement mechanics of ancient or modern warfare.

Many people love this game's map and I cannot comprehend why.  To me, it is confusing, makes the game seem more complex than it really is, places too many limits on movement, and is full of hideous eye clutter.  I just had to get that out there.  With a better-designed map, I would give this game a 7 or even an 8. However, I cannot do so currently and that is mainly due to the fact that I absolutely hate almost every last detail on and about the map.

A good, innovative design, but I'd rather play its sister, Napoleon's Triumph.  The situation is tactically interesting, but not as viscerally enjoyable as watching the sweeping battles of NT.

I'd rate it a 7 if it weren't for the ability to play solitaire, which I do enjoy.  The solitaire rules on the designer's website, which keep the strength of French infantry concealed, actually allow you to play a pretty good game on both sides with significant limited intelligence

Of course, I'd probably rate it a 9 if NT weren't so much better.

(Played with my NT blocks on the redesigned map here: http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/15180. Tip for NT owners: Office Depot can print that map in B&W for about $3.50 - you need only color in the victory locale flags!)

Probably the most innovative game I've seen for a very long time. Excellent look & feel I really like this game, or at least, I did until I started to suspect that it may become a little too formulaic once opponents grasp the one French strategy that can, given an experienced player, prove to be unbeatable. Just 2 games against one such player and all the fun disappeared for me as each turn became a familiar, almost identical sequence of well rehearsed moves, that I knew would lead to a cul-de-sac of impregnable French reinforcements lined in semi-circle fashion around the distant victory locations. Find yourself a French player who has yet to discover this master plan and you’ll have some fun.

This one feels a bit more balanced, with a more interesting map, and of course has diceless combat resolution, but the slow withdrawal process and race against the clock for the attackers is very similar.  I like this game a lot.  Maneuver is king, and there are surprising bottlenecks.  Neither me nor my opponent saw the strategy immediately in our first play, but by the end, we knew there was a mess of things we would have done differently.  Very solid effort.

Chess with drama. Write me if you want a Cyberboard game.

RATING: 7
Pretty fun, light wargame.  I absolutely love the mapboard and components.  They feel so authentic!  Not sure about this game's long term replayability though.  Have not tried the sequel, Napoleon's Triumph, but it looks even more epic.

RATING: 6
Now that I've played Napoleon's Triumph (and it has become a personal favorite), Bonaparte at Marengo sits collecting dust on the shelf. Although each game has its own merits, for me NT just does so many things better that it is almost annoying to play BaM. In any event those are my feelings right now. The fact that I'm nonetheless unwilling to sell this game (and make upwards of $100) means I still would like to revisit it someday. I feel like I never really became proficient at BaM so I'd like a chance to go back and explore it. But for now, NT has all of my attention and energy.

Rating after 2 games.

A really fun and interesting model of Maneuver warfare.

RATING: 10
Essentially an abstract war game but with a purity in both its design and execution which is unlike anything else I've played. A fascinating asymmetrical contest based on Napoleonic warfare with great production values, limitless replay possibilities and bluff. With recent prolonged play I've increased my rating to a 10.

*Further play after returning from Napoleons Triumph - still great, feels tighter than NT.

Yet another great war game.  I like this one better than Rommel, quickly rivaling Hammer of the Scots as my favorite.

RATING: N/A
I love The Look, but yikes, the valleys in this map...too bad there, and the problem is multiplied by the extra folds.

Really original design, refreshingly weird and different. But with a wargame, I have to care about the theme at least a little, and I just can't get into this era.  No idea why.

RATING: 8
Took several attempts at the rules to get this one down as it is so different from the typical wargame.  Only a couple of playings, but the elegant design is definitely growing on me.

RATING: 8.6
Unique in design.  Very playable with an excellent rules set and mounted board.  The blocks (sticks) have the unit designation already painted on them (no stickers) which is a very nice touch.  Well balanced where each player will have the opportunity to sieze the day.  Highly recommended.

Rating may change with more plays.  Very innovative system, wargamers should have this game just because it is inventive.  Rated upwards, very good game.

RATING: 8.5
Very pleased with this game. Not only does it hammer home the importance of keeping flanks safe, but also the difficulties of successfully disengaging from the enemy. It's good to see how many options in play can be had from such a slim set of rules. The physical quality of the game is very impressive, as is the customer service provided by Bowen Simmons.

I've recently been able to get another couple of games in, and have decided to boost my rating slightly. Seeing the same player get a win playing each side helps show how much this is a skill based game, and how well it rewards application of appropriate tactics.

RATING: N/A
Yet to play, but chuffed to stumble across it by chance in a game store. Have high hopes for Bonaparte at Marengo, as the mechanics are refreshingly different, and that has made it the first game of the period I'm looking forward to playing (I spontaneously bought AH's Napoleon's Battles long ago, but wasn't cut out to be a miniatures player). Prefer the alternate map on BGG.

Picked up a reasonably priced copy from eBay.  I've only played it the once but it looks very interesting with the area polygons and lack of dice for combat.

RATING: 7.5
A very interesting system, and I'm enjoying the different thinking it requires. Pretty sure the rating will go up, at least until the shine wears off. Rating up a half point. The more I play this, the more I enjoy it.

RATING: 6
Easier to learn than Napoleon's Triumph, but still has its quirky, difficult rules (i.e. road movement limits). 

People rave about the map. I don't understand that. I find it to be very boring, drab, and dull. Areas often lack terrain features to show why there are terrain penalties; it would be nice if terrain was shown on the map.

Interesting concept, but not my kind of game.  Seemed very attrition focused which might be a good model of that conflict (I don't know the history).

RATING: N/A
Simple rules forcing a careful, methodical approach. And a timetable which forces a fast-moving all-action game...

Fascinating combination!

RATING: 10
Not only is this a beautifully produced game, it is probably the most innovative wargame I have ever played.  Simple rules, yet complex and meaty gameplay.  You can contemplate moves and play whole games in your head because there is no chance element here.  My revised rating of the game reflects that I believe this to be the best simulation of maneuver in linear warfare ever produced.

I was not impressed the first time I played this, but once I finally got my arms around the game and started to understand its mechanics and appreciate the tactical decisions, the game starts to shine.  Simple but deep rules, quick playing, easy to set up, full of meaningful decisions, and tense game play makes for a good game.  It's too bad this game is so hard to find though.

After 1 Play: Hard to rate, as I'm not really a wargamer.  I like the combat system and the asymmetry of the sides, but I dislike the fiddly and unintuitive nature of some of the rules.

RATING: 8
Truly captures the "feel" and the "look" of a napoleonic area wargame. Everything fits well together and the rules are clearly written. Excellent no-luck wargame.

6/18/07 - I've seen some articles crop up lately mentioning Austrian wins.  This gives me a little hope concerning this game, so I'm looking forward to pulling it out again.
----
3/15/07 - Rating 7:  B@M has dropped a point since my last rating.  I've played 6 games of it so far, and, rather than being a contest of wills, it seems to be more a puzzle trying to figure out how in h*ck to win as the Austrians.  I believe it can be done - I definitely haven't given up.  And I still think the game is amazingly brilliant in concept.  But in terms of pure fun, I would say B@M has slipped a bit after repeated play.  I still have games of it lined up though, so we'll see how well it stands up from here.

7/17/06 - Rating 8:  I've played B@M 3 times to date, and I've been quite impressed.  B. Simmons squeezes quite a bit from this minimalist design, and I'm constantly amazed at what he's accomplished.  Each of my first 3 games were quite different as both players experimented with opening moves.  I'm really excited to see where this game goes once the rules and maneuver capabilities become second nature;  my point is that my rating is just as likely to change as it is to remain constant as I get more experience with the game.

RATING: 7
Nice game, I think. But it's like learning chess from a book: no basic strategies in the rules, so some things only seems to dawn late in play. Minor gripe: rules are good, but we found it confusing they're NOT following sequence of play. Rating may rise if comprehension does, over time.

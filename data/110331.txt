A tongue-in-cheek screw your neighbor type of game.  Lots of fun screwing with each other, while desperately trying to stay healthy enough to survive.  Lots of little in-jokes and easter eggs on the cards as well.

RATING: 7
Fun and funny game with plenty of laughs.  It's labeled as a party game, but in truth, it's just a light Euro.  Good production value and an excellent theme.  It may be a bit of a downer too, as most of the game is a slow ride to ruin, trying to see who will die last.  One drawback is the player elimination, but it did seem that the game sped up significantly when players dropped out.

With 5 people maximum you can't call it a party game, too random for a euro, macabre theme that many won't enjoy... There are many games far more better than this one. Avoid it if possible or play anything better that this!

RATING: 7
Aim to be the last player left alive, avoiding heart attacks, depression, cancer, and other problems.
Host a party and get your guests high on drugs, drunk, or sugar filled. Have a quiet night at home and have some tofu.
You can also go to work to earn some cash, go to the gym to improve your health, go to the drugstore to get some medicine.

Yeah, well, although the theme is a hilarious hit, the gameplay itself is just balancing back and forth through various tracks, while the game pushes you forward, and the cards you play/actions you do push you backwards. It seems a bit pointless and tiring. Should be more tight. It gets kind of boring and replayability hurts.

A very fun and morbid take on the game of life, where players are trying to be the last person to face death.  Each player has a track indicating his current depression, blood pressure, cancer, diabetes, etc, levels.  If one of these maxes out, you die and lose!

There are a few phases to a turn.  First, everyone must face an event, which is typically something bad like getting diarrhea or having your car break down, resulting in you edging ever closer to death.

Then, there's a worker placement phase where you can do things such as acquire drugs to ease your problems, go work out to get less fat, go to work to make some money (but also get depressed while you're at it), or buy food/drink/smokes.  You can even spend an evening at home, relaxing and eating some healthy food, or throw a party at your house, feeding the guests cheeseburgers and making them smoke, harming their health in the process.

Overall, this game is just a great time, resulting in such phrases as "Shit, I need some money, but if I go to work I'm going to die!" or "I don't really need to treat cancer, but this chemotherapy will help me lose some weight so I don't get diabetes!".

Perhaps the coolest thing is that there's also a good game under the hood.  The jokes aren't there to mask deficiencies in game play; they simply enhance it.  So, if the semi-morbid theming doesn't bother you, I highly recommend this one!

First off, this is a fixed Funny Friends. By which I mean, same concept, way simpler, way less mathy so as not to get in the way of the funny theme, more interaction (for me Funny Friends, with the differing goals meant that there was rarely much action for the auctions as people wanted different cards), smoother. Overall, pretty much everything I wanted Funny Friends to be.

Another positive is that, while you are consistently mean to your fellow players, it feels light hearted and indirect, avoiding any feelings of being picked on.

However, comedy aside, it's not very compelling. Possibly because so much of the game is about working and trying to offset the downsides to work (usually by taking the money you earn at work and spending it at the gym (just like my real life)), with a minority of the game spent trying to off your fellow players.

Then we come to the box. A huge negative for me. I don't personally have any interest in owning the game due to the fact that I would be uncomfortable if someone saw that ridiculously sexist image in my home and would feel similarly trying to suggest to others that we play it. To add to it, the image has nothing to do with the game. It's just gratuitous sexist shit.

There is actually a well-functioning worker-placement game here but it's the theme that makes this such a joy to play. Mineral water has no qualities at all! The events that come up! Giggling about the overriding theme and the horrible truths contained within this game.

If played quickly, a great joy. Over-thinking a turn could bring it down.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
So I love the fun idea behind the game - life will kill you no matter what, so it's just a matter of making the best of it.  But that moment when someone consciously chooses to have a party and hurt their neighbors over helping them live better is kind of unfun, especially if it's just luck of the draw who you sat next to.  I still like it enough to want to play again, especially to try the advanced rules.

RATING: 5
This is a bit of a morbid game as you are trying to avoid dying from different difficult events via actions you take with your three action pawns to work, shop, buy medicine, trade, rest at home or throw a party to wreck your neighbors, etc.  Game drags on a bit long for what it is and I'm not certain there is a ton of replayability here.  I sorta had fun at first making light of everything, but actually got perhaps a bit depressed as I played...there's just not much positive one can do and whoever can fight off death the longest wins.  Text and icons are pretty tiny and tough to see at times.

This is NOT a party game. This is a worker-placement hand management thing, too slow and dull for a party (or party-mooded non-gamers), too shallow for worker placement gamers.
And laughing about death by cancer or depression is not only stupid, it's just plain horrible.

I played 200+ different table top games in recent couple of years. This and Munchkin are the worst ones I tried so far.

What can you say about a game where you are trying to kill off your opponents with terminal illnesses? 
The artwork & theme will mean that you are either going to enjoy this game or decide it is far too politically, ethically or socially incorrect to warrant any table time at all. Add to these issues that the game is aimed at a male audience..... just read the cards and expansions, if you don't believe me... and this game has a very limited target audience.
So with the right group of players who are more concerned with killing opponents than optimising their worker placements to survive longer, then this game is great fun!

Quirky fun for 2 to 5 players!  You need a serious sense of humour to play this game, as it focuses around a black parody of life.  Last one standing, literally, wins.  Now if you excuse me, I'm off to a kemo and wheatbread party.

Easily one of my favourite games added to my collection last year.

RATING: 4
There's no way this could end in 45 minutes with 5 players. We quit after what felt like 2 hours and still not a single dead player. The game itself is a somewhat tedious numbers management game - you just twiddle your own board by taking whatever actions you want and rarely does anything come up that affects other players. I wouldn't call this worker placement as there's no blocking or interaction or even taking turns - it's just "do whatever three things you want". You can do the same three things every turn for the entire game and do OK.

Take it for what it is, simple mechanics, laughs and inappropriate subject matter. You have to try and kill the others through heart disease, depression obesity or other. You visit locations and take events but generally you just try not to die as others bring you to parties full of bad food.

Infarkt was the real surprise ..... One show.

I state that it is a game for people with humor and can poke fun at himself.

The game consists in dealing with the lives of everyday .... every player will take an event card (always leaving the worst opponents), and this will impact on him.

Event Cards: yesterday we went from winning the lottery, job promotion, job loss, divorce, death of his grandmother, etc. ....

everything will raise volori of our bridge player ... Cholesterol, tattiti heart, blood pressure, depression etc. ...

then you will go to position 3 men on the main deck to remedy
then you will go from the gym (weight loss + loss depression) to work (take money but also depression thanks to my colleagues) pharmacy (impasticco me) I can have parties where I'll engage my opponents, and of course where I will be playing cards drinking and smoking of all ...

who wins the game will be alive ..

I repeat is not for everyone ... but I enjoyed it a lot and we'll play again

I really enjoyed this game the first few times I played it. I felt like it hit a good niche by being a light strategy worker placement game and having such a party type theme. But the more I played it, the more repetitive it felt. It also became apparent that the game really breaks down if everyone just spends time protecting themselves from the events and not feeding terrible foods to their neighbours.

This is an odd little game to review. It's a little heavy for a party game (essentially involving a little action selection and resource management) and has player elimination. One for gamers definitely, but only those gamers who know how to have a laugh.

Really, it shouldn't work, but somehow does. The humour is done just right (working gets you money, but also causes depression) and the game is just fast enough that it doesn't outstay it's welcome.

It's not perfect (the drugs lucky dip can be pretty swingy) and I wouldn't want to play it every week, but it *is* fun and we've had laughed every time it has hit the table.

  Oh boy is this game fun. Throw a party and try to kill your friends. Played it with the wife and kids, and every time their characters depression would get bad, I'd say "I know what will cheer you up! A party!" Which is exactly the last thing they needed. Ha ha.

 Hilarious game. And a good one for the family too.

7 for the theme. Replayability is likely an issue and one of the rules is going to be problematic - that paying for sex somehow reduces stress, but doesn't indicate your life must be pretty shitty to stoop to that level.

A worker placement game with player elimination in that you're trying to kill your neighbors with health conditions. It's a theme I haven't seen elsewhere and the player elimination fits well and usually doesn't leave someone out of the game for too long. Once one person dies, usually the rest are starting to border on suffering from some health consequence.

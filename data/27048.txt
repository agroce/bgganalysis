This one is actually fairly entertaining.  It's sad that the first edition got such a bad rap for being moldy and low production quality.  This game is great for what it is, a hidden movement bluffing type game.  Adding in all of the extra stuff is not really necessary, the base game alone provides enough fun without adding the complexity.

First game, I was the Germans defending Emden.  He was across the channel almost before I could get my nachtjaegergeschwadere in the air!  Must think up a strategy to defend against that.  Maybe civil bunkers?  The Mosquito destroyed all the city defences and laid 4 target markers!  To make matters worse, my Dornier got carred away, and had to ditch trying to follow the bomber back to Britian.  Quite a whooping for me.

I found the game very easy to play, and quite enjoyable.  The rules were quick to explain (even for me - I'm a terrible rules explainer) and simple to follow.  I'm definitely keen to try this one again!

This appears to be exactly what the wargaming hobby has been asking for. Quick, simple, easy, novel & interesting subject, with some tactical depth, well-balanced, usefully expandable. I imagine its one that will be played a lot in a short space of time. Nice components, but getting a viable copy of the game is another matter.

RATING: 6
This has an interesting mechanic, with very much a Euro feel to it.  Your goal is to pull your enemy into your hex.  The British escort fighter runs interference, hoping to pull German fighters into the hex, so that they can score victory points.  The Germans fighters are trying to predict the pre-programmed bomber route, and it scores points in proportion to the number of fighters in that hex.  Meanwhile, the Brits get additional points for bombing, whereas the Germans get points for flack guns, lights, and radar.  The player with the most VPs at the end wins.

It is a lot more challenging than it appears, as you have to plan well ahead to coordinate and plan your attack, and even with the strong Euro-influence, it works.  The gameboard has issues, though (curling up), but they sent me a new one -- class act, that Zev is!

Only played it the once, but quite enjoyed it.  My only concern is that some of the bluffing sequences are a bit obvious.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I played the British and felt like I had very little control over the outcome during the game. Once I had planned my bombing route (which I have to do without seeing the German defences) all that's left for me to do is move the mosquito. I could have played smarter by trying to fool the German player by moving the mosquito off track. But still, not much control.

And, of course, this game needs to be reprinted by a better printing company.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Theme wise is ok. Game play is only fun when you are getting into later missions, not for the sake of bombing but more for the sake of generating VPs.

No link to overall strategic decision as in the real war. As a game is quite ok,excitement is not too bad. But still feel an overall lacking in a 'war-ish' environment.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I hate to say this, but my feeling after playing the game was: "Huh? That's it?"

The meat and potatoes of the game is in the planning. The game, such as it is, is just execution of a mental exercise, with a little bit of bluffing added just for... fun?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The British attempt to plot a safe course through the German defences to its target, then misdirect the German planes to minimise losses. 

A zero sum game where points for one player are points against the other.

I like the bluffing, but the game is definitely designed to be played over several nights.

The bits are lovely, and it looks great on the table, but somehow even these massive hexes get unbearably crowded when they have a plane, cloud, fog, ground defenses and target markers etc.

To be played more!

RATING: 7
Nice cat 'n mouse type bluffing game. It's fun and not too heavy. The rules are pretty straight forward and the game plays quickly so you are always wanting one more game to try something new. The solo version is decidedly lacking I'd say, as you might expect. In a game that is all about bluffing and trying to figure out what your opponent is doing the solo aspect just doesn't fit well outside of maybe learning the rules.

DitD is often compared with [gameid=18], but I don't get it. It lacks a certain thrill and there isn't much thinking involved. Once the British player has planned his route there isn't much for him to do apart from moving his Musquitto.

Though it fast playing - for me not a pro perse - this isn't a too bad attempt for a WWII air war simulation at strategic level.

Played it a couple of times now against an opponent and it really is good. Duel in the dark is the perfect name for it as you start off by only making choices based on the weather.

Not what I was expecting.  This is really an abstract deductive game.  This isn't a wargame.  The Germans are trying to guess the British direction and outmanuever them.  Combat is abstract and gives points rather than causing losses.  Interesting game, but because of the abstract nature of the manuevering less fun than I was anticipating.  

The bits are beautiful, and the mechanics are certainly innovative.  Looking forward to another play.

I tried to like this one but couldn't. There's something about it that leaves a pretty dry taste in my mouth - maybe the lack of randomization.

Each turn the British player's choice seems to be a simplistic "Do I feint or not?" while the German player is too busy futzing around with his finicky, little fuel gauges to care.

This is one of those rare instances that I can't pinpoint what exactly is wrong with the game. By reading the manual it looks like a brilliant atmospheric WWII duel. By looking at the components and the art it looks amazing. However, it does not work as well as it looks. Altitude is a main issue that I can easily recognize: needed more work there, gameplay-wise. Apart from that, a mediocre light wargame.

Initial Impression: I love the thick, chunk, durable components in this game. The stands , which could have been replaced with elevation markers, help to give this game a sense of the third dimension. I only played the beginner game, which is a good introduction to the mechanisms but leaves little to do for the bomber.The game feels thematic, with weather effects, fuel effects, and ground support. However this is a buffing/deduction game with a tug-of-war VP mechanism built into it that works exceptionally well. I look forward to trying out the regular game in the future.

2 player greatness! In my Top 10 and will probably stay there. DITD has deduction, second guessing, resource management, and beautiful components. And it all plays in a tight 30 minutes.

At first play I was frankly a little underwhelmed.  I love the idea of how combat is abstracted into the back-and-forth point swing - but in practice, this really seemed to remove a lot of tension and excitement from the game.  Moving up to the advanced rules - which aren't so complex that they really shouldn't be the default way to play - makes a big difference.  Weather changes, the variety of defenses to use, and bomber reprogramming all make for a more interesting game.  There still seems to be something lacking in this game that I can't quite put my finger on, but it's getting better as I play it more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Beautifully produced game about British night-time bomber raids over Germany in WWII, the narrative of this game is more like a movie than a wargame: you're not so much prosecuting a campaign as following the exploits of a cast of "actors." That said, the game is easy to learn, plays quickly, and fairly tense (again, in a cinematic sense) as the RAF Bomber, her Mosquito escort ("Mossie"), and the German night-fighters battle over Germany. Lost of interesting detail covering the ground defenses  (Flak, Searchlights, Smoke Generators, Firetrucks, etc.) are seamlessly incorporated into play of the game. ...Finally, the object of the game is simply to rack up points. Generally this is achieved by the Brits avoiding the German defenses and bombing the target. Or-- as the Germans-- by intercepting the Bomber with your nightfighters or correctly surmising its course and planning your ground defenses accordingly.

This is a superb game - it's good solo or two player. There's a mixture of preprogrammed and immediate movement elements and this creates plently of options for guesswork, bluff and double bluff as well as for the positioning of German ground and air defence resources.

The game also looks amazing with the planes and clouds positioned above the board. Excellent.

The mould and odour issues were not a big deal for me. There was a bit of each, but some antibac cleaner got rid. Job Done. I bought confidently on the understanding that the worst of the problem had been dealt with and that seems to be the case.

RATING: 8
The British night bombing over Germany during WWII is recaptured in this Chess-like game. Can be played any number of ways: solo, PvP or TvT depending on the number of expansion modules you've incorporated. The base game is ideal for two players. A single night mission plays out in 30 - 45 minutes. Campaigns of any length can be constructed from a selected series of night missions. The playing surface is a map of Western Europe marked with cities and airfields and is quite gorgeously detailed. Large hexes regulate movement of the aircraft pieces.

A single duel (night mission)consists of the British player picking a single target, plotting the route from hex to hex (secretly) using cards a la Robo-Rally or Wings of War; then, the German player arranges his ground defenses and stations his night-fighters. The Brits also have a Mosquito sqdn that takes off just ahead of the Bombers to pave the way or generally disrupt things in aid of the mission.

A game round consists of the Brit player first moving his Mosquito and resolving any action it may then take, next the German launches, moves and/or lands any of his fighters resolving what that might trigger, finally the Brit moves his bomber piece according to the pre-planned movement cards, scoring points as necessary. Rinse and repeat until the all the pieces have returned home again thus ending the mission.

Provision is made for various German ground defenses (searchlights, radar, smoke, flak, etc) and his night fighters have limited range which is tracked from move to move thus requiring careful management. As for the Brit side, the Mosquito has the ability to neutralize a limited number of the German defenses and mark the bomber's target area (for extra VPs) as well as harassing the German night fighters. Provision for wind and weather is elegantly weaved into the implementation and it is possible for the weather to changes at various times during the mission. The presence of weather (clouds or storms) in a hex can have a significant impact on both sides.

Despite the clear attention to most of the pertinent details of the period and the elements faced by Bomber Command, the game is quite abstract in its scoring. At no time are any pieces removed from the game - losses are reflected in the various ways VPs are tracked as the game progresses. Points are awarded for notionally destroying German defenses while intact ones being passed over by the Bomber piece will award points to the German player. Similarly, points also represent lost fighters and bombers. Once reaching the target area, the British player receives points for bombing his target (the areas furthest in award more points) subtracting points for surviving ground defenses in the same area. The bomber piece will always make it to the target and back home again but the number of points scored by both sides as the path is traced is what makes up the game. 

Altogether, the game is both ingenious and engaging offering a number of interesting strategies and tactics for each side every mission. Numerous expansions add yet more elements for increased (while still abstract) realism. The quality of the components is quite striking as a very 3-dimensional feel is imparted by having the aircraft on transparent towers to reflect variable altitude (even the clouds hover above the map), and overall the quality of the artwork and supporting player aids is excellent.

As a quick playing and simpler alternative to other games on the same topic (Luftwaffe or Burning Blue), this game is well worth attention from those with an interest in the Battle of Britain theme. After just one play I'm very impressed. Well done!

RATING: 6.5
I give the credit to the publisher and author de Pedro to have the guts to bring such a game on to the german market. 
The Artwork and components are superb and distinguish this game form other bombing games.
But the game is just medicore. First the german player sets-up, so the other one has to wait. Then the britsh can program his flight. In the meantime the other can play with hisself. The rest of the game is just a resolve of the programmed flight, with no corrections. Just the placement of the fighters and the mosquito affects the vp assignment. 3 pts here, 2 pts there, antoher 3 here etc. Is not really a game,  more of a abstract calculation. Furthermore there is no kind of longtimefun as it`s to repetive.

After a single play at the Australian Games Expo, which I thoroughly enjoyed, I will definately be purchasing this excellent game.

The game has a nice weight and time length, it is intelligent, has plenty of choices, can be very tense as a result of an excellent bluffing aspect.

Update:  Bumped the rating again due to a few more plays.  An excellent game with plenty of excitement and nervous tension.  Great fun!

This game was very different from what I was expecting.  It's all about moving across the board and collecting points.  That's not a bad thing, but it certainly doesn't feel like I'm flying a plane over Europe during WWII.  It feels like I'm moving a token on a board and collecting points.  Maybe if I play it a few more times so that I'm familiar enough with the rules to make it flow more smoothly my rating will improve.

RATING: 8
UPDATE: I've been quite enjoying this game, but I think you really need a few of the  mini-expansions to make it fly. I really think the Germans need a little bit of a boost to even things up, so giving them the Ju88, a couple railroad flak, and the MW80 fuel, or restricting the British a bit with The Walls Have Ears helps the game.

I recommend playing 3 nights for a good, solid game - enough time for the weather to even out, and for the British to mix things up a bit. If only we had a "planning" map so both sides could do their set-up simultaneously ...
---
First couple of plays have been quite fun. I think its achieved a nice balance between up-front planning and the tactical on-board play, and the raids play quickly and cleanly and are fun. And it's pretty thematic as well. Not sure it'll have a ton of replay value out of the box, but I hear rumors of expansions and that might help. Also, in fairness, I've seen a fairly strong pro-British bias (No German wins in 4 games, and only one was at all close), and this sort of thing will always kill replayability if it continues. Overall, though, a unique and fun game which I've been enjoying.

The English rules are not as clear as they could be. Not a deal-breaker, but they require puzzling through. Things would be easer if the example of play (otherwise quite well done) included a few things like a dogfight/interception in the clouds, because how the Mosquito scores and how the interceptors score is subtly different and can be confusing. Also, the insert is terrible. Normally I would mock a game reviewer for talking about the box insert, but this one really is pretty bad.

Solid, heavily underrated wargame.  No luck, Euro-type gameplay which is pretty fast and offers tense situations.  The game board looks amazing when setup and I really enjoy the cat-mouse game of predicting your opponents moves as well as trying to deke and fake out your opposition.  I'm also fond of the short playtime (30-45 minutes).  

The rating was hammered due to the first printing, which suffered from mold problems.

Clever idea and neat components. Played a few games now. I enjoy the planning phase (whether bomber flightpath or German defences) more than the actual gameplay which is a bit of an anticlimax due to the abstract nature of scoring victory points rather than seeing a few bombers go down in flames.

Great little game and looks great on your table as well.  The 3-D aspect is very cool too, with clouds hovering above the game board and the planes moving around.  The solo play variant is pretty nice, there are advanced rules to add a little more complexity and strategy.  The variety of mission options makes for very high replayability.  This is a great game that falls into the category of "very simple mechanics but with good strategy, replayable, very fun, and very teachable to a newbie."

update

Ok, has been three years, THREE YEARS and this game still reeks! I would love to know what sort of toxic carcinogens were used in the making this game. Thank goodness I keep the game well away from everyone in the house or I might have grown a sixth toe out of my forehead or the cats a third eye out of their butts.

The only good news is that for the most part it seems dried out. Well maybe as dry as a peat bog I suppose. Perhaps if I dig deep enough into the box I will discover 4,000 year old mummified remains of some Chinese peasant. Do they have peat bogs in China?

Still a 10 on the CrazyYog Stench o' Meter.

----
circa August 2007

"I bought my copy at this past GenCon and when I got to my room and opened it up my nose was assaulted with this intense chemical smell that is almost like glue or paint thinner. This is no small smell at all. You can smell it across the room and it gives me a headache. Right now I have it all spread out in another room to hopefully air it out.

Also, when you touch the components they seem spongy and damp to me. So, am I alone or does other peoples copies smell as wretched as mine? Also, why the hell does it stink so bloody much? Did they rush it off from the printers to get it to the Con and the stores with the glue still damp? I wonder at that also because the insert for the box was not assembled and in place. Instructions were supplied so I can assemble it. I managed to do this through the stench and the damn lid does not come down all the way when everything is in the box. I find this really annoying.

The cards in the game are really, really thin and cheap. Cards printed from cardstock are thicker than these things. They will definitely need card protectors, but I really should not have to supple these for a game.

My last issue is with my game board. There is a small perfectly round hole in the board right at one of the folds. This is right at Hex #20. I am curious to see if this happened with other copies. I should not have bloody holes in my brand new game board!

So far I am not impressed at all. It seems to me that this was thrown together and rushed out as fast as possible. I am also worried that this stink will not go away and I will be left with a useless pile of smelly card board.

In the past I have been very impressed with the quality of the products coming out of Z-Man Games. Unfortunately, the components of this title are not up to those standards and I can only hope that the game play will make up for some of this. That is if I can get past the REEK!"

Sorry only 4 points because this game is in clear violation of 1925 Geneva Convention's Protocol against the use of poison gas. Otherwise I would give it a 7.

6/12/12:  Obtained this & Duel in the Dark for In the Year of the Dragon in the No Cultists MT

1 play: It took a few of hours to out everything together, figure out what was what, get through the rules, and finally start playing.  We'd planned to play two rounds, switching sides for the second round, but only got through one what with the start up time.  We used only the base set and the basic (red) ground defense.  The game has an interesting mix of bluffing, deduction, and puzzle solving.  It seems like there should be a lot more to explore, even without adding in the expansions.

I want to play this again, but I have a headache... I guess from the smell.  Unfortunately the construction of the game seems to be a bit lacking.  I have some rule questions to that we couldn't quite work out from the rules.  But all in all I enjoyed the game.  I played the Germans and had some fun trying to setup my defenses in a way that made sense.  I really felt the limitations of the war (well in some ways).  I look forward to another game.

Top notch components and artwork. Missing a plane holder. Could use a nail as supplement. Game concept is very interesting. Could have been 8 or 9 if not for:
1) Rules are badly written. Important info are scattered all over. Mixed English and German doesn't make sense. Not easy to tell what components belong to what expansion.
2) Rules should be organized by how you get points. User reference doesn't help.
3) It's very hard to push the pieces together and assemble the inner insert.
Sold in favor of Android Netrunner (asymmetric, bluffing). Besides I have too many 2 player only games.

RATING: 1
The components and the map are nice.
The concept itself attracted me to get this game but it was really hard to even get through the first game.
The strategy is super simple and even if you win, the satisfaction from it is minimal.
Being able to plan ahead is a nice and potentially interesting concept, but it is very inflexible and does not seem like fun the way it was executed in this game.

My first thought seeing this game: great, you can fly a Lancaster and do some bombing. So after reading the rules a was a bit dissapointed. Getting hit by flak costs vp, hitting Messerschmidt's gains vp. Some sort of Euro-ish blabla? 
My mistake. This isn't about flying individual planes. It's about fleets of planes. 
Anyway: I like it. Planning the raid and defense, resolution and improvisings using fighters or the mosquito.

Played through the solo game after airing out the components.  The board smell made me a little ill, but the gameplay was fun.  It's more of a guessing game than a real deduction game -- the decision-making is pretty lightweight.

Recommendation: When playing 2-player, download the plotting map so the British player can leave the room to plot his bombing run while the German player sets up his defenses. That'll avoid the lengthy downtime of each player waiting for the other to finish setting up, which makes up the bulk of the overall play time.

After a couple of plays, my opinion about this game is becoming clearer.  While this game is good, I have found that I enjoy the thought of playing it more than the actual gameplay.  The pace of the game is really slow in the beginning, and it does pick up as soon as the board is set-up.  Both times I have played, neither player has eagerly asked to play more than one night.  I do enjoy the bluffing and anticipation.  The bottom line is--there is already little time to play games, and this one will not see time because there are many others I would like to play before this one.

Very impressed: asymmetric, with the British having half planned and half reactive movement, and the Germans having reactive movement plus static ground defences.  Give a real "feel" for the sorts of decisions that the sides had to make at this stage of the war.  Love the scoring system: VPs with modifiers, rather than worrying about individual shoot-downs; and no rolling dice or CRTs!

My last game made me realise I like this game a bit more than I initially thought. The game has a nice bluff component where you try to hide your intententions by  clever use of the mosquito. But it still didn't grab me like the similar Mr Jack where I feel that most games have a narrative arch to it. Duel in the Dark feels a bit mechanically.

My one play of Duel in the Dark left me rather cold. It's a nice bluffing game and the game itself looks nice and is dripping with theme. But somehow it didn't catch me like I expected it would. Maybe I have to give it another try sometime.

Only two games so far but enjoyed both. Simple and easy to pick up, despite somewhat 'iffy' rule book, yet still presents intriguing and difficult decisions and manages to be quite flavoursome with regards to the theme.

Components and artwork excellent, except the cards which are a little on the thin side. I was fortunate in my copy not showing too many signs of the 'damp' issues that affected some early copies - although there was a strong smell and slight ink bleed to the underside of the box lid to hint at what others had suffered.

Anyway - worth the asking price and some. Deserves a bit more play.

RATING: 6
Two player or solitaire game depicting the night bombing raids by the RAF over Europe during World War II.  In the two player game, the British player pre-plans his bombing route, while the German player sets up his 40 "defences" chits (archie, searchlights, etc).  Then the raid is resolved using the plotted route.  The British player has a Mosquito fighter-bomber to run interference on the raid, while the German player has four night fighter interceptors that swallow petrol at an alarming rate (i.e. they can only go up for a short amount of time).  Victory points are awarded on a sliding scale for interceptions, flying over defences and of course the bomb run.  A rather simple game, wrapped up in a truly confusing rulebook (at least the English half is, the German rules are probably fantastic!).  The solo game has the player playing the Germans, defending an automated raid run by the game system.  Great presentation, the art is very dark and brooding.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very intriguing asymmetrical gameplay. While one side primarily score its points in one shot (dropping the bombs on its objective), the other side continuously gets points for harassing the other player. 

Lots of abstractions (you never really lose any of your game pieces, which is quite different from ordinary wargames) means that the game is quite easy to pick up except... for the scoring system which is problematic at first to understand. But once you get to about half way through the first night of the first game, everything should click and then the game becomes one of rabbit and foxhounds: since the british bomber is pre-programmed and has a fixed route, the german fighters have to guess which way it will go and try to get as many VPs as possible.

While the subject matter might be objectionable by some, it is nonetheless a good play experience, which, although abstracted, gives some insight in an aspect of WW2 which is often ignored.

will probably hit the table quite often as it is fast playing. Can't wait to try Bomber Command, however, to contrast it with a more simulation version of the same situation.

Kind of a missed opportunity.   It's all about trying to hedge your bets on pre-programmed flight paths.   The bombing and dogfights are completely abstracted into +/- victory points, removing any sense of action and excitement from the game.  There is no combat whatsoever.  The game looks unique, but the production has a weird thin coat of laminate that peels off, making it feel cheap.

Set in WWII, this game is fun as it uses the unique mechanic of a bomber taking off from England and making its run throughout Germany.  The British will have a hard time making that run and keeping points as the Mosquito is used to keep German planes at bay, but with only one defender, it becomes fairly balanced.  German planes on the other hand have to worry about fuel and they also have to worry about what course the planes will take.  German forces do however have many weapons at their disposal and can give the British a real challenge.  A little bit of euro meets ameritrash, but lots of fun.

An interesting secret deployment/programming game. Duel in the Dark seems to be quite a game hybrid with heavy theme, minimal randomization, and euro style scoring. I'd be pressed to say it's this type or that of game. Looking forward to playing this again, with the advanced rules next time. The rulebook is a little poor, but it's worth struggling through to play the game underneath. Great Zman components in this game.

This has been a fun game so fa. The scoring can be a little confusing at first, with all of those disc on the board, but it seems to be catching on as I play.

The game looks great. I love all those stands for the planes and clouds and it just looks awesome, while being played. Everything is pretty well made and works well with the game.

Basically the British are running a bomber run over Germany and the Germans are trying to put a stop to it.

I'llupdate this and add more, as I get a few more plays, to get used to the game, but so far it's been fun.

I thought it would be something with bluffing and outsmarting of your opponent. And it was. But there was something more: add this, substract that, multiply by that, divide... Please! When I play a game I want to have fun and don't want to count the outcomes of my every move just to realize that I got 17 points and my opponent 15 so I have to move the scoring marker by 2 points to the left.

I admit - the game looks fantastic and the idea is very original but that's it. Pity because I was counting on something much much better.

This is a very interesting game.  I have some feelings that it's a large guessing game that is a couple of simple decisions masked by lots of little moves.  If you guess wrong in laying out your defenses and the british player went big, you've lost in a big way.

Another kid friendly starter game.  My son enjoyed it but i could tell it was kinda beneath his expectations.  This game has TREMENDOUS visual appeal but very few actual moving pieces.  The British play moves two things and the German play moves three.  It looks great but it is war-game equivalent to golf.  It is an enjoyable game.

Strongly themed, really capturing the historical flavour. I love the artwork, especially the way the clouds and planes float above the ground (on stands). Plenty of scope for bluffing and the winner isn't always clear until near the end. Game begs for use of suitably painted 1/300 miniatures. My version did not suffer at all from mould (purchased Oct-08).

I had heard a lot about this game and got it on those recommendations. It may just be the theme but the game did nothing for me and I have a hard time teaching it. There's so many ways to get points and lose points and so many different pieces that make you lose points and gain points in different ways. Just kind of confusing.

Nice components once fully dried.  (except the thin cards)  Oversimplified Euro with a war theme.  However, the short playing time (it says 45 minutes, but it is closer to 30 minutes per night) gives it a half point boost.  While the pieces try to be immersive, any immersion is broken by the VP/combat system which feels like your basic exercise in euro accounting.  There is a bit of bluff here, but because of the preprogramming elements it really feels like there are a minimal number of interesting decision points.  Numerous expansion tiles have been announced, but I don't see how adding more  /- VP modifiers will add much to the game.  Maybe it was because my expectations were high, but this game seemed a little flat.

RATING: 7.5
Really good game with lots of bluffing.  Each side - Germans and Allies - has its own variety of strategies.
The mechanics seems brilliantly innovative and quite simple (despite of a lot of modifiers) at the same time.  Many historical aspects are included in it.

Some complain that the Allied player has a little to do and the game is more exciting for the German player, but it's simple, fast (30-45 min) game so it's no real problem.  And whatever side you are it's just a sheer pleasure to observe how the game develops :)

After several plays I'm ready (and eager) to explore advanced rules (change of weather I tried already) and the campaign mode of course.  That might elevate my rating.

Solo game mode works, but I would gladly see some rules clarifications.

I got an advanced copy at the WBC. My first complaints are that the cards are very thin and the box insert....grrrrr!!! First, you have to assemble it yourself and you'll need three hands to do it. Then you'll discover that the insert doesn't allow enough room for the game board, so the box doesn't close all the way. In fact, it's at least a 1/2" off!!!  I bagged everything and stored the insert separately, what a waste! The game has potential but the rulebook lacks clarification on many details which is a bit irksome. We'll see how it goes after more plays and some rule clarifications.

**Update** besides a few grey areas in the rules, I really like the game and I've bumped up the rating. However, I don't care for the solo version.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Overly fluffy and simple for my tastes. I got to watch it played at origins this year and listen to the demo guy explain it. Also perused the rules. Politically correct in that no one is "shot down" - abstract points are simply scored when opposing sides meet in a hex. Other gizmos such as searchlights, radars, ground AAA units etc simply modify the points. 

Looks easy enough to set up and explain, quick to play. May yield some cross-over draw in getting Euro gamers to try a pseudo wargame. Not likely to interest serious wargamers for long, nor direct them toward Euro style games.

replayability low on my meter due to limited number of game options.

Initial Rating: 3.5 (June 2015)

Initially, I didn’t want to play Duel in the Dark, it seemed like a war game and I almost never like those, however in a recent Dice Tower Top Ten list, Tom Vasel said this game was about deduction and that it wasn’t a Wargame. I love deduction games so I requested a play. Duel in the Dark IS NOT a deduction game in any form and it was very boring. Perhaps Duel in the Dark isn’t a Wargame but it has more common elements with Wargames than it has deduction elements.

The rules are awful, the game components are ok. I like the premise of the game, but the implementation is pure guessing on both parts. I grant that it isn’t all luck, but, as the German player, if you guess right you will win. Related to that topic, it seems the game is easier for the Germans, but I would need to play more times to verify this (I won’t). Lots of uncontrollable luck on this one.
 
Ok components, the theme is indifferent to me. Long setup time. I like that the game comes with 9 mini expansions in the box.

Bottom line, a crushing disappointment. I will do my best to stay away from it. Perhaps it will appeal to a solo player.

This is after only one game and probably not doing justice to it. But I didn't really enjoy this game. Normally, I like the mechanism of programming moves ahead. Here it just felt random and left me most of the game with the feeling that there's not much game to it. Bluffing the other player into moving his fighter in the wrong direction is supposed to be the fun element. For me it didn't work out to be fun enough. Calculating VP's each move considering every modificator was a hassle further decreasing my willingness to play again.

DitD might not be the deepest game and it might have one of the more poorly written and/or poorly translated rulebooks out there, but it's a fun strategy game that has a nice puzzle feel even if it lacks a sense of "really" plotting a bomber flight or a German defense. At least in the mold-free second edition, the components are quite nice, with a lovely board, some 3D elements (planes, clouds, thunderstorms), and good-stock cards. The second edition includes nine mini-expansions, which I have separated out but haven't explored yet.

Hello, I am one the test player who has the pleasures to test the game in the last year extensively and also the changes resulted during the testphase. The graphic conversion and the set of figures succeeded best and the player could always get along on the gameboard.The play depth as well as the set of rules are in such a way laid out for everyone whether beginner or hardcoregamer can play, after a short introduction phase, immediately.At last, i must say, whom I played only reluctantly before boardgames but i'm always interessted for the airplanes, strategies and tactics of the Second World War. This game meets my taste, since of the play depth, the variable elements and the conversion.

A game of WWII airplanes and second-guessing your opponent over the skies of Germany. The game itself isn't very difficult (although the player aids were badly laid out) and plays fairly quickly. The scenery is really beautiful when set-up.

Despite some complaints (set-up time for Britain and Germany, cardboard quality a bit suspect), the game has the perfect level of complexity for a 30 minute timeframe. Different weather keeps the game interesting as do the introduction of advanced rules. If only the game were a little smaller and more portable, this would be the ideal 2-player game.

A really nicely designed game and a fun little puzzle. There isn't much to do once you've mapped out your routes and set out the defences.

Played once, and that was not enough to truly form an opinion, as we had bits of trouble with the rules. Much of this game is in the setup, and after that it seems largely to be turn after turn of the British player trying to protect his bomber by bluffing/not bluffing. It's all about outguessing your opponent. Now that I think about it, this game has a lot in common with Stratego.

Beautiful artwork and very interesting gameplay. It's very fun to play this one, BUT the quality of the game components is really a shame for a game of this price tag! The board even cannot lay flat on the table because it is warping and when layed out the two middle sections are overlapping, or - when forced to lay next to each other - the open sides on the left of the map gape! A real shame :( It was hard work to "restore" a working game board, so the game is really good. But @all of you who don't want to invest an hour of "tool time": Don't buy this one!

RATING: 4
Yawn.. Theres some interesting stuff here but its just way too slow. It takes forever to set up the board for each bombing run and then pick the bombing route and then you simply spend half an hour largely playing out what you set up at the beginning. In the end it just comes down to whether you happen to bluff successfully or not.

I don't think the bits actually look that good in real life either.

There is a somewhat fun game here, but for me it just falls in that middle ground. As for pre-programming games, there's none to touch Himalaya yet, and the subject matter here (as well as being only for 1-2 players) would require a more detailed and less abstract approach. Made me very interested to try out Bomber Command and Nightfighter though.

It's game is a bit more of a 2 player abstract puzzle with a heavy theme than the war game it might first appear to be; it's not really war at all, there's no active combat.

I like the bit of guessing and deduction, though the advanced rules allow for adjustments during the actual play and other weather changes to occur to continue to shake things up. 

The rules say it's longer than it is; perhaps with a ton of elements and still being new you'd take longer, but a round of this is still a 30 minute experience.

I actually think my rating will rise over time.

RATING: 7
Not my usual thing, not being a war gamer as a rule. But then this is not much of a war game as such, as the planes keep flying however many times they are hit. It was fun anticipating where your opponent was going to put their guns and where they were going to fly out, but in the end, this blind bid type mechanic ends up being pretty random. A neat game to play once or twice but I doubt I'd want to ever pick it up even if it were a theme that would appeal to my wife.

Bought this game at an inexpensive price from Tanga.com

Rating is +2 because of the airplane height mechanic in the game, without this mechanic I would probably give it a 5.

The game takes a long time to learn and play the first time.  Even after the first time, the game takes a long time to setup and play for the small number of actual choices that take place.  The German player can have won or lost after setting up her/his defenses, which is one thing I don't like about this game.

I think this game would be fun to play with a friend that owns it, and is worth the price if you can find it for cheap, but I think too few choices are made for the play time requirements.

RATING: 6
A thematic, but highly abstracted game about bombing missions in WWII. It takes a lot of counting to determine the victory points every turn and this detracts somewhat from the immersion.

Very clever asymmetrical gameplay, but unfortunately this also means that one player can be very busy whilst the other is waiting for something to do.

06/12/08 Received. Overall I've very pleased with it. After all the horror stories of people receiving copies full of mold I put off buying for nine months. I'm glad I finally changed my mind; my copy had no mold. The only quibble I have is the same many do, the box insert is too tall, making the box lid stand up about half of an inch too high. One other quirk, everything is translated into English except one word on the board; Ruhrgebiet (Ruhr area).  
As of 01/09/17 I've played 22 games solitaire, and 13 games two-player.

Though the designer stated that the copy I bought from him was opened and aired, it still smells bad (combination of oily and mouldy stench). The box has tiny mold spots in the corners.

This game stinks! Literally! I don't know if it's the printing process, the slime mould from the Z-Man storage dungeon or a combination of the two, but both box and contents give off a nose-scarring reek that has pervaded the whole house. Hence, I'm not allowed to open it at home. I have to take it to a club to play it... which I haven't yet.

Beautiful and very thematic 2 player game, with completely asymmetric sides. Unfortunately it's asymmetric fun-wise too, because the quite fiddly strategic plot planning phase is mostly fun for the British player, the raid itself is mainly about the German fighters with a little room for bluffing with the Mosquito. A nice game in overall, it feels a bit unbalanced.

Great two player World War II game that simulates a night time bombing raid over Germany.

The English player commands a squadron consisting of a bomber and a spitfire fighter escort while the German player lays ground defenses and commands a squadron of four Messerschmidts.

The board is beautifully rendered and includes weather in the form of clouds on stands that move according to the wind affecting visibility and giving positive or negative bonus damage points during encounters.  

Fun game for two warriors!

Really a Euro with a war theme, but not a bad game. It's main virtue is that it's simple to get into, it's main flaw (other than Euroness) is the fiddliness and set-up time.

It does not make me feel like I'm conducting (or defending against) strategic bombing campaigns. But it's mildly interesting to push around the little airplanes and count up the victory points. I would not want to do it for an hour or more.  But for 30 minutes, it's okay.

I don't know why but I had quite low expectations of this game. As a result I was really pleasantly surprised. I know the point system has been criticised but I think it gives a nice historical feel to the game. It is probably the best solitaire game I've played. Compared to, say, B17 Queen of the Skies, which has interminable table lookups, the missions work really well and relatively realistically and above all is quick and easy.

Frankly, I fell instantly in love with this game as soon as I saw it.  The components are spectacularly cool, and the gameplay matches.  Programmed bomber movement, like Roborally, and lots of bluffing and guesswork by both players.  All the games I've played or seen played seem to end in very tight fashion, with the winner not determined until the very last move.  A great game, and beautiful, too.  Note:  I also have the expansions, but don't mark them each as owned since each counts as a separate "game" in my count, which annoys me.

A "cleaned" copy.  The one I got was moldy, and I returned it.  The one I got back was referred to as "cleaned."  The board isn't exactly right, but there's no mold.  Threw some "Do Not Eat" dissecant packs into the box just in case.  

Also, I kept the rules from the original game, so there's a copy for each player--Better than New!

I love WWII.  This game is not too heavy, but lots of fun.  It has the feel of bombing run with the Bomber trying to hide in the clouds, flak flying everywhere and the Germans despartly trying to minimize damage from the bomb run.

There is strategy, guessing and a little luck to this game.  Playing the Germans has quite a different feel than playing the British.  It is great to switch off sides after each night.  The changing weather patterns are quite fun.  The board looks awesome once the clouds and storms are setup.

I reccomend this to people who like WWII games, light strategy and 2 player games.

 Base game - all opened and punched. Still has a little of the smell that came as part of the first set of games.  All the pieces are present. It includes 1 each of these expansions: Acoustic Mirror, Quad Flak, 2* Railroad Flak (though only 1 card but still 2  tiles), and the ju88 Night Fighter (this though is missing it's flight stand, but since you trade out 1 plane to use this it should be fine). The expansions are all playable as they are with this game. This also includes an extra "medal" and 3 extra Mosquito target/bomb markers.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Preliminary ranking is 8, for originality. Only two playings so far. I'm wondering about replayability but let's wait and see how it goes.

The artwork is outstanding and so is the 3D effect.

In the first edition, the components were a quality control disaster like you've never seen before. You don't see a moldy box in a brand new game every day. Anyhow, Friedemann and Zev did a spectacular work in replacing the worst components.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Nice components hide the fact that this is a slightly more abstract game than it looks, as the two sides gain and lose victory point depending on the route of the British bomber and the German's response. Most of the decisions are made during the set up, and depending on how heavily the Germans defend the secretly chosen British target I imagine the game will sometimes be decided by the time the bomber takes off. However the interesting interplay between the British Mosquito and the German fighters has enough impact to sway the victory and provides enough fun while the players determine whether the bombers chosen route was enough to win the game. Quick, light and entertaining enough that lucky/unlucky set up doesn't spoil the game as you can always have another shot afterwards. The artwork and design really captures the style of the period.

I've only played this a couple of times but so far I can't help but feel a little disappointed with it.  There just doesn't seem to be a huge amount of strategy involved in it.  I'm also not quite sure why so many people were frothing about the componenets - they're alright but nothing to write home about.  Maybe my opinion of it will improve after a few more tries.  The rulebook (at least the English section) is also a bit vague about some of the rules.

It's a laborious setup and there are questions over whether the skill of the bluff outweighs the luck, but it's beautifully thematic and playable which is good enough for me. The German player has the big decisions to make during the setup - whether to go big civil defense or big on air defense, and whether to consolidate in areas or spread across the park. The game can be won right there if they guess British intentions correctly. And it's pure guesswork. None-the-less, executing the run out and back is fun. Each turn the British player is trying to bluff out the Germans. The Germans have the continual question of whether to consolidate fighters, going for a big win, over sure points by spreading out. Plus the need to manage fuel. And the theme is triumphant, meaning it's a fun 45-60 minutes regardless of how the luck and the bluff plays out which is just as well as there isn't a lot of weighty decision making once the bombing run commences. It's also better if you can play it regularly against the same player so it's meta-gamed a bit (hmm, they did that last time, what will they do this time), and also because there is lots of fiddly VP accounting knowledge needing to be reacquired if it's left too long between drinks.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A twist on the theme of stategic bombing, in that there is no actual combat. It's more a case of positioning your pieces every turn to score the maximum number of points. The Germans cannot stop the Allied player making his bombing run, but must try to score enough points via night fighters and flak/searchlights etc to compensate for the points the bomb run scores - an interesting concept. 

What we need now is a Dambusters version.

Update: Got to play a two player game last night. Was even more fun. Very close game but I ended up losing as the Germans. I underestimated my opponent as she had never seen the game before. She sent her bombers right between my defenses and hit Hamburg. I also made the mistake of pushing my fighters too far and had to land them to refuel. At this point I couldn't catch up to her bombers to do any more damage. She won with 4 VPs. Es ist immer das nächste Mal!

As someone designing a wargame on the subject of night raids on the Reich, I have to admit an interest in DitD. It is interesting how this game parallels my own design in many respects. It is handsome, fast and packs a lot of flavour into a very 'lite' wargame. It diverges from history in a bunch of places--particularly the functions of the Mosquitoes--but does a brave job of touching on many elements of this fascinating subject.

Excellent production quality even though it smells like kerosene. But wasn't much fun to play the only time I played it. The German player sets up all sorts of anti-aircraft defenses on hexes over France and Germany, then the British player flies the bomber and its escort over those defenses on a pre-set route, and you see if the defenses stop the bomber from completing its mission of bombing one German city.  The game lasts up to 14 turns alternating with the British player moving his 2 planes one hex, and then the German player moves his 4 intercept fighters, but annoyingly these fighters have to constantly land every couple turns to refuel. Not sure I'll get this to the table again. (Update: Traded it away.)

Nice-looking, although the less said about the soggy-box-storys the better. Quite fun, not too long, although unsure exactly how much depth there is to this at the moment. Feels like there is more guessing/bluffing about the plotted route than anything else.

Friedemann de Pedro (Designer):

RE: Missing Bomb Marker
"we seek for a solution with the missing bomb marker (should be 8 for advanced game, not 7 - although only need 6 for normal rules) and the additional target marker (not really neccessary). A solution could be: we produce them together with the extension, but for all who don't want to buy the extenson, they got it for postal cost together with a free mini-extension for balance the postal cost, the other got it included the extension also inlcuding some of the mini-extensions."

RE: Better Quality Cards
"the idea is, to reprint the weather cards together with the 'Campaign rules', bacause we need there some other weather cards, for example the weather from 31.3.44, so we can put them in this expansion. The compass card we can reprint together with the compass cards for the 'Baby Blitz'-expansion, because we need some for the He 177. So this is the only way to distribute new cards without any transport costs."

Two scenarios with one win for each side. Although there are some tactics to be learned with more plays, the game seems to be nearly a solitaire exercise for the Germans. To a large degree, once all the pre-programming is done and the defensive set-up is revealed, the outcome may be essentially determined with the players just going through the motions for a swing of a few points either way. Quick and amusing to play but seems to lack the 'spark' I look for in a wargame.

RATING: 4
Awesome components with the clouds on stands and the plane stands. Once setup it captures the atmosphere of the period.

Since the British player is much less active than the German I would recommend 2 rounds with each player taking each side.

The game contains a good bit of guessing and bluffing. If you guess right with the path or the defenses you win big, wrong and you are in for a long night.

I guess I would consider it a war-themed game rather than a simulation. 

While an awesome looking game - ultimately it didn't appeal.

RATING: 8.5
Very interesting.  So far I've played the solo game as well as a couple of two-player games, but only using the standard rules (and no special tiles), but I like what I see.  

Playing solo against a random deck is largely about playing the percentages, I think, and could get dull after a while; playing against a real person is a game of bluff, nerve, intuition and reading your opponent right.

There is a fiar amount of "luck" - if the British player programs a route that manages to avoid most of the German ground defences by chance, the result will be markedly different from one where he flies through almost everything, but part of this will come down to knowing your opponent - does he favour a straight run, or a grand tour?  Close targets, or far?

Nicely produced, with very finctional stands for changes of altitude, and some very nice counters.

Shame that the rulebook is such hard work though.  Not bad as such, just reads like it's been translated by a babelfish, and without its explaining certain tricky concepts (like precisely when you land).  Oh, and the box insert is 5mm too tall.  But neither detracts from a quality product and a quality game.

Great game about the nighttime RAF raid over Germany in WWII.  Perfect blend of mechanics and theme.  Wargame? - YES.  Eurogame? - YES.  Box of fun? - Hell YES.  It did stink  to high heaven when I opened it, but a couple of days open on the table and the stench subsided to acceptable levels without further intervention.  BUY IT.

Each player sets up independently, and then watches their preparations collide. You have some measure of control during the air raids. Great components. Make sure if you get it, you get a copy that's already been opened and verified mold free.

I had high anticipation to get this one. A game with both solo rules and two player action. I was sold.
Single night solo games can be a bit boring, but I find multi-night games can be tense. 
Two player games can be fun, but not the thrill, on the edge of your seat game I wanted.
It looks great and plays pretty well. Hit on most points for me, but just not enough to play often.

--Oct2007--  Rules give me a modest headache; I find myself reading backward and forward trying to recall how things work.  The game itself is physically quite a bizarre combination of crudely cut map (with excellent atmospheric design) wonderfully designed cloud and airplane tokens, an insert that's a bit too tall for ideal function, and some appallingly paper-thin cards.  If I were to be uncharitable, it looks like a bargain printing of a spectacular design - and I think I'd rather have paid $20 more for a better quality printing. Bah.

The game itself is in the same family as Scotland Yard (though not nearly as derivative as Fury of Dracula) with a bit of the programming aspects of Robo Rally thrown in for fun.  I was quite amused the first time out.

RATING: 6
Very high quality of art and components to this game.  That alone nearly pushes my rating to a seven.  I can see the attraction to this type of game, though it's not really my favorite thing when it comes to mechanics.  I'm not so good at this type of game, and both my plays left me very frustrated as the Germans.  It feels like there is a bit too much that rides on the german's shoulders and too little on the brits...  it also seems that unless ground forces are layed correctly, a decent british player can out manuever and bluff a good German.  I'll definately enjoy playing this from time to time, but I doubt I'll ever play it enough to be really good at it.

RATING: N/A
The game looks interesting. The only thing, which feels very unpleasant/offensive to me, is the fact that you have to bomb German cities and civilians. I lived in Dresden and Berlin for many years, and although I don't feel emotionally attached to these events, it gives me a hard time to score by killing 100.000s of civilians. This is probably one of the reasons, why I never heard of a similar topic in a game. But maybe I'm the only one with this issue.

RATING: 5
Great bits. The game play doesn't really grab me though. Too much counting of victory points? Too simple? Too long to set up? Too much of a guess, or outguessing? Can't really put my finger on it - maybe a bit of all the above.

RATING: 9
Duel in the Dark strikes me as the perfect nonwargame.  It's about war but uses an abstracted euro-feeling mechanism to score points.  The planning is half the fun and really is the only hitch in gameplay itself (in each planning stage players could be sitting waiting for the other for a bit).  However, once both players are on the board for the final phase the game is fast and furious.  

The components are typical Z-Man -- fantastic!  My copy was the Second Edition and additional packaged expansions are no-brainer purchases.  Have not tried 3+ players but the base 2-player seems perfect.

FUN!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Tentative rating: This one has fantastic components (planes and clouds that actually elevate!) and atmospheric graphic design. 

The gameplay? The Brit player uses cards to preplot a Roborally style flight path. The German player sets up defenses (flak guns, radars etc). The game then begins. Each player tries to gain VPs with the Brit scoring by bombing objectives as well as using their mosquito to setup engagements with German fighters. The German player tries to get VPs by hammering the Brits with defenses and dogging the B52 with fighters. Toss in weather effects into the mix as VP modifiers and you've got a fairly fast playing tactical game.

Not so sure about the real choices players get to make as the entire British flight plan is preplotted. Also, why do the German fighters have to worry about fuel and the Brits don't? Some elements seem like they've been put in to make the mechanics gel as a game.

Would be interested to try with advanced rules and solitaire rules. A looker for sure!

[Sept'07 - ZGD]

After one game (as the Brits), I rate this a good 8.5 though I'm expecting this to move up to 9 after more plays. My first game was tough... lots of cloud, thunderstorms and new moon, on all three runs.

Game mechanics are streamlined, and very elegant. 

Update: Now rating this a 9. I've enjoyed a number of games now, and this is growing on me more. Some nail-biting action.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There are a couple unfortunate elements in this game.  First, the British have to front load their actions which leads to a significant amount of downtime while the Germans just have to wait it out.  It is not only important to plot out your moves to how you'd like to approach your objective, but you must triple check that you aren't making any mistakes.  This can really take some time.  

The second, while not being as obvious is perhaps a bigger issue for me. There is no danger to the game.  You give or take some points, but it doesn't seem that you are really going to get shot down, well because you don't.  As much as this is a clever little cat and mouse game, I don't suspect that this will ever be a favorite because of this.

With those things in mind, it is fun, and frankly it is gorgeous.  I like the way it plays out.

I fear that it may not have a whole lot of replayability, but I haven't yet played the advanced version.  Still, it is a fun little system.

After playing this a few more times, I'm sad to say that it's really fallen out of favor with me.  Components are a HUGE 10, and the theme is just great (so is the art).  For me, the scoring mechanic in this one of making a move and having to check who is where, what hits what, etc x20 tied it down and made it blah.  It just doesn't *feel* quite the way I'd like it to.  But definitely a game that is unique and one that is worth playing some time.

Great-looking game with great components, but not really a wargame at all, despite the theme.  It is more like an abstract game of guessing and bluffing, with a programmed flight plan (which I like) but quite repetitive turns.  No real combat - the goal is simply to accumulate more points than your opponent by virtue of many detailed modifiers at each point on the flight.  Not really to my taste, I'm afraid - which is a pity 'cos I like the theme and love how it looks.  Maybe I can make up some different rules to use with the nice bits ...

This game does a really good job of getting the theme across - feels great as the bomber flies over Germany in the dark...

Feels quite well-balanced too - good job on the points-design!

German name sounds a bit like "Dunkin Donuts", and Liz (who has a degree in German, was born there, and lived there) sounds great when she says it!... has only added to the game put me off. 

House rule: German player must play with German accent. British player must take on a "Roger Wilco" accent. Lose 1 point if you lapse :o)

One downer? ... mould. Need to get me some antibacterial wipes, but so many little pieces that it just puts me off...

Cat and mouse across the skys of Germany. Very clever, if slightly abstract wargame. As a avid reader of Bomber Command history there are flashes of thematic fidelity, though the simplistic nature of the game means it is more of an abstract (with gorgeous bits) than a simulation.

This is a fascinating, tactical, 2-player game of cat-and-mouse-style chasing, bluffing, and optimizing limited resources.  Although the theme and game play are completely different, this game does remind me rather surprisingly of "Mr. Jack" (only with less depth and more fiddly rules), which is still high praise indeed!  "Duel in the Dark" is a very well thought out treatment of a very interesting subject matter - they have managed to pull together a lot of elements to create a game that is simple yet mildly strategic, tense, and fun.  And the 3-D depiction of the planes and the clouds is brilliant, and makes for a very visually appealing game.  I do, however, have a couple of very minor quibbles.  While I recognize that the game is called Duel in the "Dark" I wish they had used a bit more colour contrast to make it easier to distinguish the various bits.  While the game is simple enough, it is rather, for lack of a better term, fiddly, due to the number of things that need to be kept track of at any given moment.  And the play is definitely balanced in favour of the British player - however, just like in "Mr. Jack", this can be remedied by having the players switch sides and play the same number of nights on each side to see who can come up with the highest score while playing the British side.  Also, while the possibilities of different types of aircraft, ground defenses, etc. are quite exciting and might help to balance the game more, what's with all the mini expansions??  Why not simply wait and combine them all into one "Duel in the Dark Expansion"?  [Edit: It looks like the up-coming "Bag of Expansions" will do just that!]  Anyhow, I think it would be fun to try this with four players, one controlling the bomber, one the Mosquito, one with two German fighters, and the other with the other two German fighters.  And I have to conclude with a word of praise for the excellent support Z-Man Games has given to this fantastic game.  Good on ya!  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 8/10

Rating based on one play.

What a cool system. It makes for an interesting game of cat/mouse. You only "attack" if someone moves into your space as opposed to the usual games where you "move in" to attack. I love the pre-programmed moves of the bomber; however, how can you do this with your opponent sitting right there? Asking them to leave the room or turn their back seems odd. I think a player aid is needed here... a small personal map for the British player maybe.

Gorgeous bits. This one attracts a ton of attention on looks alone.

Based on one and a half solo plays (I reset the first as I'd messed up when to score), this lacks tension as a solo game. It seemed way too easy to dump all of the defences along the West coast of Germany and to play the odds with the fighters (if the Mosquitoes were to the East, to put 2 fighters North East and 2 South East and take the 67% chance of the bombers flying in to you), meaning that I'd maxed out the scoring track. The bombing would maybe score 10-20 points back and then they'd have to run the gauntlet of my heavy defences and fighters on the return flight.

Needs to be played as a 2 player game to rate fairly.

Brilliant and efficient game design, evocative and functional 3-D visuals, and plenty of background fluff add up to a package that's one of the better 2-player Euros I've tried.

But a couple aspects clash with my tastes:

1) The victory points are thematically nonsensical.  A German player victory contradicts the game's narrative, which is always a successful bomb run for the Brits.  Victory should be based on something other than VP, like, you know, the success or failure of the mission.  I've seen "Memphis Belle," and I don't recall a shot of the Germans celebrating in the end for having shot the plane. (I wonder if the Baby Blitz expansion with its additional game board addresses this issue...)

2) There's a strange lack of tension compared to other hidden-movement games, like Fury of Dracula.  Perhaps there's too much revealed information, making the game more of a cerebral exercise than a dramatic experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A really cool design with some great production values, hindered by a lack of meaningful decisions and a play time that's a little much for what it is.  I enjoy this game, and look forward to adding in the more advanced elements, but it's not going to be something that I'm always trying to play.

RATING: 8
Excellent game for middle- and high-schoolers, as a follow-on to experience with 'Dogfight', 'Wings of War/Glory', and perhaps DG's mini-folio 'Eagle Day'.  DitD presents a splendid panorama of the nighttime aerial aren over the Third Reich and occupied Europe, with evocative visual imagery and a great array of extremely well-done bits.

Play proceeds, once weather have been determined (and note: the game takes weather seriously) with the German deployment of his air-defense forces, which grow quite elaborate in the more advanced variants, while Bomber Command plans its targets, routes, and pathfinder employment.  The game captures the entire look and feel of the nighttime strategic air campaign simply and effectively, including the cerebral challenge of predicting where the adversary will place his focus of effort (German fighters and Flak; RAF bomber stream and flight route) and the subsequent scramble to adjust to meet unexpected threats when one's prediction comes a cropper.

Excellent companion to 'Down in Flames' and preparation for 'Luftwaffe' or other theater-level campaign games, as well as advanced studies such as, for instance, Brimmicombe-Wood's 'Bomber Command'!  (Basically DitD is 'Bomber Command' for youths.)

Z-Man is to be admired for producing a game that lets at least one historical strategy-gaming club provide youths with an experiential look at one of history's most important yet obscure campaigns (and of course, prompt discussion about why so many wish to forget it).

World War 2 air combat game depicting the nighttime air raids of British bombers hitting German cities.

After playing the game, I'll disagree with those who call Duel in the Dark a hybrid game. It's a unique entry into the deduction game category, yet firmly fits into the bombing theme the game provides. Both the British and German players are playing with completely different styles, yet the game only really emulates a war game via its theme. Folks who do not enjoy even light war games may have a good time here, as players attempt to outfox one another in a game that is more about maneuvering than it is about fighting. And I like it, see my review for more details...

Acquired in a math trade.  I haven't played this one yet.  The components are really nice.  To bad I got one of the moldy ones.  I placed desiccant and dryer sheets in the box and that pretty much took care of the problem.

I did not get this game at all. The programming gave no challenges and the playing/deduction when playing started seemed quite lame. Think I have to play it through some more.

Fits into the same two-player short niche that Memoir '44 hits.  I like that this can be played with any number of nights.  I'm thinking the sweet spot is with the advanced rules and three nights.  The advanced rules in particular really make the German play a little more realistically by allowing the British player at least a small amount of course modification to avoid the worst of the air defenses.  Like the weather cards as well.  Really makes the game a lot different every time.  If you like this game, you may also want to check out [gameid=3646], a game which seems like it was certainly referenced in the development process.

RATING: 8
(using beginner/red tiles only)  Unique, quick, fun, thematic blend of a war game and a euro game.  After one night I kind of figured things out and the 2nd night went much quicker.  The summary scoring cards are very useful and really do cover a lot of info on them.  A mix of bluffing, strategy, resource management and so many ways to score VPs.  Wonder what effect the grey/advanced tiles and allowing for weather changes will have on the game - perhaps better or maybe more random.

this is a awesome game. i truly think it is unappreciated on the geek. this is a fun war game that is quick and not complicated its nice for a light war gamer.

Excellent cat-and-mouse game,with both sides giving a different play experience.The game looks fantastic,with 3D clouds and planes on flying bases covering the map,and all components are up to Z-man games usual scratch. I find the scoring mechanism kinda weird,it's almost a perfect information game where you can compute your score each turn,but the tension is almost palpable as you play,and therein lies the experience.
Would recommend getting the second edition if you can,which comes with 8 or 9 mini expansions thrown in,for greater variability,customisation and sweaty palms.

RATING: 5
VERY cool.  The mechanisms are unique, as is the gameplay.  I can't really say that it captures the feel of dogfighting, or air raids, or whatever the heck this is really about, but it's interesting, and demands a lot of attention.  I like the imbalanced sides, and the way that the scoring track works.  The weather reminds me of the "Fog of War" card from Feudo that I so despised, but it's such a small part to the game that it's forgivable.  My biggest complaint is that it's too Chess-like, and requires too much in the setup to play well.  Given that limitation, it's hard for a new player to go up against an experienced one.  I doubt this is one to own, but it's definitely one to play.  And if I happened to receive it as a gift, I would probably keep it.

World War 2 air combat game depicting the nighttime air raids of British bombers hitting German cities.
\13\\13\
As the head of the British Bomber Command, you plan the attacks on Germany in order to undermine the morale of the civilian population. Or as a General of the German Air Force (Luftwaffe), you defend using your ace squadrons and organizing an effective civil defense.
\13\\13\
The gameboard enables you to set up countless variations of these historic events. You play as many nights as you wish - each night takes 30-45 minutes to resolve.
\13\\13\
Immerse yourself in the strategic and tactical thinking needed to survive in those dark times.
\13\\13\
Gameplay allows for easy entry into the action with some advanced rules for the hearty wargamer. The game rules include weather conditions, full moon/new moon bonuses and penalties, clouds and thunderclouds, fog, flak, searchlights, balloon barriers, target markers, and much more.
\13\\13\
The British player secretly plots the course of the bomber while the Mosquito acts as escort or decoy. The German player tries to figure out where the bomber is going, making sure to efficiently use the fuel to get as many hits on the bomber as possible.

Asymmetrical light wargame. Thematic, not sure about the balance. First print run had mold problems.

RATING: N/A
I've got one of the 'fairly' honky copies (bit smelly but not too bad).  There are ways to clear up this problem but I haven't got the inclination.  The game looks promising but all I've managed to do so far is put the clouds on their stalks.  Would love to play but unfortunately I need to have a bit of a clear out and make some room. Due to this sitting on the shelf for about a year - it has to go.

[b][i]Duel in the Dark [/i][/b]is a perfectly fine game that's not to my taste in games with lots of bits to set up and rule details to keep in mind to recreate a historical scenario that I don't care to recreate.

Nice components, though I wish the tile art was higher contrast (it all kind of blends without looking closely).

Unimpressed by game play so far. There is a reason it's so cheap.

Gets my vote for cool mechanics of the year.  Nice bits but there was enough moisture in the board and bits when mine arrived I could have squeezed a cup of water out of it.  This is a fun game of bluff and anticipation.  Fast play and solo capable.  It's probably my most anticipated arrival so far this year.

Wow, that was bad. The idea of a combat game but no combat? Bits look cool that's why this rating is so high. I'm not sure I want to try it again.

Beautiful components, interesting theme, ok game.  To me, the biggest issue is that there is a lot of downtime for the German while the Brits set up, then a lot of downtime for the Brits while the German sets up, then the game kind of plays itself with a couple of decision points (and I do not minimize the effect of bluffing, etc.).  The good news is that it is quick.

I haven't played the game yet, but the components are among the worst I've seen from a major publisher. My copy of Siena was perfect, but this is China rags compared to what we're used to from Germany.

UPDATE: Played five times, didn't like it. Too programmed (duh). Too static. Too dull.

Bought a copy from a FLGS, got it home and found that not only was it missing the rules, but it suffered the moldy damp affliction others have mentioned. Took it back, FLGS kindly opened their other two copies but the were much the same. Bought a copy from Friedemann de Pedro's website. Looking forward to playing. My only remaining (minor) gripe is I just wish it packed back in the box better...

Excellent two-player game, and the components are awesome.  This game looks really impressive when it's set up on the table.

Far more abstract and Euro-y than most people expect when they see the theme, which is a big reason for all the whining you'll see in other comments, but once you view this game for what it is, it's a lot of fun.  There is very little "reaction" - it's all about trying to anticipate what the other player is about to do.

If you're interested in it be sure to get the [b]Second Edition[/b] that includes a bunch of the expansions, and more importantly avoids the mold issues that plagued many first edition copies.


[b]This is [u]not[/u] a simulation by any stretch of the imagination, so don't go into this game expecting it to be one and then get upset when you realize it's not.[/b]

This is an interesting game. Not sure what to make of it really. Have played a few times and hope to play more. It was in rough shape when it arrived - damp - damaged - you have read about it. But ZMan made it right. The last game was a draw - 0. How cool is that.

SOLITAIRE:
Standard solitaire: German side win the solitaire way too often and too early to be fun. The game is usually over right after the English drop the bombs - no need to play the way back home. 

Solitaire with some additional house rules: since the game is really clever with a big solitaire potential, it becomes massively enjoyable when you balance the power by a few house rules. i've become addicted to it and play every day. every game is a different story. No dices, no charts - just a clever positional game with a little bit of a resource management.

Solo game has a fair amount of luck, but still an enjoyable way to spend 30-45 minutes.  You still have to plan your defenses, but since the British bomber movement is random, you miss out trying to second guess your opponent.

After 1 Play: While this bills itself as a deduction game, the defending player has to make his most important decisions before doing any deduction.  You are left to either evenly distribute your defenses (which should result in a mediocre defense), or clump them to a greater or lesser extent and hope your opponent hits them.  Yawn.

Nothing exciting here - one of the few games where I really miss rolling some dice. Once you set-up your course there's not much left to do. You bluff a bit and then score some points for one or the other side each turn. Overall a very good presentation though.

06/29/09 -- Duel in the Dark is a clever game, but it's also unfortunately rather dull.  I've played it twice, and both times I felt like I should be having more fun than I was.  Oh well.

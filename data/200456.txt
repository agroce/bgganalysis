RATING: N/A
Dual-cost cards and a shifting market row mechanic... very cool. This is among the less-swingy expansions, which makes it excellent in my book. This comes highly reviewed by a respected Ascension lover.

RATING: 3
A very poor deck to play from. None of the mechanics really work because your deck gets filled with the basic cards. If you remove most the dark blue cards and the mechana constructs, it works out okay. It's potentially even fun at that point.

I think the day/night cycle is pretty interesting. Adds a bit of strategy to which cards you play/purchase and when you do.

RATING: 7
More Ascension on iOS is always fun. This new game introduces a day and night mechanism. Every card is associated with day or night. When you have your 6-card display, if it has more day/night cards than the opposite, it's day/night. if there are an equal number, then it's neither day or night. Most of the cards in this set have abilities that relate to whether it's day or night. Another new thing it introduces, is heroes that require both runes and power. I really like this addition since players often find themselves with left over power in the early game. On the other hand, if you're play this set by itself, you should probably focus on getting some power early for the multi-cost heroes and for killing monsters. You'd probably do much more poorly than in other sets by going a rune-heavy strategy.

I personally, like to mix this one with one other set to dilute all of the day and night cards. Day and night, can still flip on a dime, but I like having to choose between mostly day, mostly night, balanced, or a mechanism from another set (i.e. insight from Dreamscape or energy from Rise of Sigil). It adds extra decisions on how to spend power and what cards to take from the row, knowing it could change to day/night. Overall, pretty enjoyable!

The artwork really has come around by now.  I thought the dual costs and day/night mechanic would make this far to mechanical and fiddly, but it's not at all.  Day/night might be my favorite added mechanic for Ascension, actually.

easy to learn deck builder.  If you've played dominion u already know how to dominion u pretty much know how to play this game.  I like how each version add 1 or 2 mechanics and has a page of the rule book covering "what's new". 

This versions add day night cycles where your card will be stronger depending on this cycle. This adds a cool dynamic where you can make plays to change the "board" state more in ur favor.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like the day/night cycle quite a bit. It puts some extra emphasis on planning out how to execute your turn to try and maximize all your card  effects. The dual-cost cards are pretty tricky to acquire. I welcome the added challenge as long as it doesn't slow the game down too much, or cause matches to get too "mystic/heavy infantry" focused.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
By far the best and most balanced set. All the mechanics are solid, and you finally have a viable way to play split between runes and power. Also the four factions are all viable in this set.

Nagyon jól sikerült ascension doboz. Jó hogy már kombinációban is lehet költeni a haderőt/pénzt, illetve nap/éjjel ciklus is érdekes csavart visz a játékmenetbe. Ez különösen csapatjátéknál lehet izgi, ahol azért van esélyed a másiknak befolyásolni a helyzet alakulását. Sima kompetitívben is szórakoztató volt, de azért még egy plusz szerencse szerepet visz a játékba, amiben eddig se volt kevés. :)
Az egyik elgjobb ascension doboz eddig.

RATING: 7
Early impressions are very good. On one hand, it's super swingy and chaotic, even by Ascension standards. On the other hand, the decisions seem subtler and more difficult than with any other set. The purchases are harder to evaluate, and the day/night dynamic adds some tactical risk/reward nuance to the sequencing of your card plays and purchases.

Plays best mixed with one or two other sets, rather than on its own. Be warned that any cards which acquire or copy heroes based on their Rune cost will be overpowered (because they undervalue the mixed-cost cards by ignoring the Honor cost). Sets that have very few cards of that type, and seem to combine well with War of Shadows: the original base set (I), Storm of Souls (III), Realms Unraveled (VI), Darkness Unleashed (VII), and to a lesser extent Dreamscape (IX).

Probably our favorite of the ascensions.  Good balance between simple and nice innovations (night and day and cards that cost both strength and runes)  This one doesn't feel over complicated. Great game.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (March 2017)

Ascension X: War of Shadows is an ok iteration in the series.

The rules of the game remains the same plus the added day-night mechanism and the dual cards. I´m surprised it took them this long to make the dual cards :D.

If you know the rules, the changes can be explained under 1 minute, if you don’t, the whole game can be explained under 7 minutes.

As all Ascension games, it is much better with two players.

The art is great. I have always liked Ascension’s art right from the beginning!

In general, I heavily dislike deckbuilding games that feature a variable market offering as this one does. The reason is that the game is mostly about tactics (reaction) than about strategy (planning). In this regard I vastly prefer to play Dominion and its true descendants (Tanto Cuore, Penny Arcade, Nightfall). I really hate when a good card appears on my turn and then it doesn’t on an opponent’s turn, for me, this kind of game is very unfair and luck has a very high influence in the outcome. Having saying that, I’m enjoying my (iPad) plays of Ascension X: War of Shadows. (I won’t ever buy a game like this in real life).

The day-night mechanism adds a lot of uncontrollable luck to the mix because your cards have added capabilities if it is day or night. Sometimes they work and sometimes they don´t and you cant affect much if it is day or night.

Bottom line, Ascension X: War of Shadows is an ok expansion/standalone. I won’t ever buy it due to its chaotic nature with the variable market offering, but I will continue to play it on the iPad. It has way too much uncontrollable luck for my liking and too little room for planning.

Current rating: 5.0

This is a very solid set in the Ascension series. Dual cost heroes and a day/night system makes decisions way less impulsive and the timing of playing your cards from your hand actually matter. Though interesting, this set can tend to be a little unbalanced at times, especially since Mystics and Heavy Infantry can be used effectively pretty easily. This is still a very solid set regardless.

Perhaps my favorite set of Ascension aside from Rise of Vigil. The light/dark mechanism is neat, and I like that cards have costs in the form of money and combat. This makes combat far more vital, and the game is better overall as a result.

There's a good deal of depth to this version of Ascension, with the dual-cost cards, the day/night mechanic, and effects based on what's in your discard pile, which make judging card values and sequencing card plays highly important. Unfortunately, chance plays much too large a role. Some of the day/night effects are disporportionately powerful, and players can get high-level cards very early in the game that essentially guarantee a win. It's no fun to play a game where the outcome is known so early, nor is it fun to just forfeit such a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a fine set, but probably the most complex so far. The night/day can swing back and forth and often times the cards I have in my hand can be gimped by a single purchase. I also find this doesn't seem to combine well with other sets. Not to mention that buying a card with a multi-cost is fucking difficult some times. It feels like you need to balance fight/buy to have a reasonable ability to actually purchase things on your turn. It's growing on me, but not nearly as much as the other sets.

Includes the Chaos Rider promo.

RATING: 4
Based on the digital version.

Dual cost cards means you'll likely buy nothing but Heavy Infantry and Mystics in the  first four to five turns.
The Night/Day effects are overpowered and random, giving the advantage to whoever draws the right card at the right time.
Lazy design. The cycle would have been interesting, had the player the chance to offset day or night by paying resources or doing something in particular. As is, it all boils down to luck.

Once again, good idea, poorly executed. Nothing much to see here.

I own the set via the mobile app, but have played the physical copy many times at friends' homes. This is my favorite deckbuilder, beating out even the great Dominion (mostly a thematic victory - Dominion is dry as a desert). I love the artwork, the day/night cycle is a simple and compelling mechanic, and the game feels about as smooth as a deckbuilder can feel.

Like the precedent, this game finally look... professional. The artwork is even better than dreamscape. The mechanisms introduced in that set and the cards works really well, but not as well as dreamscape. I recommend. Also, the theme is even less "creepy"/"dark" so that's awesome.

Oct 2017:
I now own 4 Ascension games, which I realize is not even half of the full collection.  However, this remains my favorite of the 4 and is the one I'm first to recommend.  The new mechanics are solid and interesting without overcomplicating the game.  It plays well at every player count, shining just as well at 2P as it does at 4P.

Original:
Prefer over the base game.  New mechanisms are simple to understand and can still work with most new players.

Ascension with a twist on the center row! There are some fun cards, like every Ascension set, but it doesn't seem like the day/night mechanism will transport well to a combined/curated set. Will non-aligned cards be neutral? Would you be in Day with 2 Day cards, 1 Night card, and 3 non-aligned cards?

It's small, it can play six people, and even with teams. It allows for some truly hilarious moments but if push comes to shove, let's play Red Dragon Inn instead.

I've print/played better components than these, too.

No tactics. You have to that that as a beer and brezels game. Take it as a western movie and have fun with the nice cards. Dont reduce it to its mechanisms or you wont have fun at all.

An alternative to Bang! with a mini board for movement but I prefer the now classic party game over this. It seems that it could be a better game or maybe it just wasn't good for my gaming group.

This falls into the same category as games like Munchkin and Boss Monster for me.  Draw cards, hope you get stuff that will do lots of damage, and also hope you get stuff that will protect you from damage.  Practically no strategy here, other than deciding who to attack and where to hide.  There's not much strategy in deciding what to draw - everything of use will have been used already, so just draw a new seven cards every time.  I did not enjoy it.

Pretty cool, light, shoot em up filler.  Gives you a wild west flavor but without the committment of Gunslinger.  No, not as good as Gunslinger and on the same level as Bang!  Different flavor from Bang! tho.  

This would be fun with minis!

Fun, but gets bogged down when people over analyze their move.  It plays best when people play fast, and it fits the theme better.  Fast, messy games are fun; slow analyzed games are lame.

Very fun, beat-up-on-the-competition style card game set in the Wild West. The theme came across really well I think, from the moving, to the weapons, to the attacks; really worked for me. Played a six player game, everyone for themselves, and I'm looking forward to playing in teams as that should get even crazier and more fun.

I'm giving it a 6, but with the right group, High Noon Saloon can cowboy up to a 7 or 8.
This game is best played with teams, and it's a hoot. However, it's one of those games that you don't get out when your surly uncle Frank wants to play a game, or if you're playing with overly sensitive types.
This is a game about a bar room brawl and all the dirty tricks that come with it. You're shooting six-guns and throwing tomahawks at each other, for land's sake! It's a last man standing game, so don't bring your care-bear, co-op playing, schoolmarm friends.

It may talk big, but High Noon Saloon may have the smallest playing board of any game I've ever seen.
It works, since the game is more about the cards than the board. Cards represent weapons, attacks,and dodges. There are also cards which increase damage or modify attacks in genre appropriate ways, and it adds more thematic fun when players read these cards out loud as they play them.
"I'm gonna hit you with this here frying pan. And it's gonna be a powerful, mighty, fierce hurt that knocks you out the wind'a!"
The more your players get into the spirit of the game, the better.
Think of it as a film set on the back lot of a cheesy 60's Western. That is the spirit of this game. All of the cliches are here in Technicolor glory. Someone's getting a bottle smashed over their head before they get pitched through the saloon window. And before the fight is over, there's going to be at least one person who gets called out for a showdown on the dusty, furniture strewn floor. Keep it light, keep it quick, and have a gut-busting good time.

This is a fight-to-the-last-man card-driven game that's great to play in teams of 2 or 3. Best described as a more complex version of Bang! A bit of a learning curve at first to get to know all of the cards and how to combine their use, but once you get the hang of it its great fun... until you die :)

Initial Rating: 4.5 (July 2013)

Mediocre game in the vein of Bang! I prefer High Noon Saloon over Bang but this is not my kind of game. The theme doesnâ€™t do anything for me either. I dislike games in which most players will attack the current leader, also it has LOTS and lots of undesirable and uncontrollable luck, the decisions are obvious.  I can see why this is a fun game for some people, but not for me. Perhaps I will play it once a year if that much. The only aspect I like is the negotiation required in the game.

The best I can say for the game is that it plays rather quick but still I feel it is too long for what it offers.

I think this is best played with 5 players, with 6 the down time begins to be an issue. Not sure how they made the game with 2 players as I think the game would be 100% luck in that case.

Not a game for me.

A bit heavier than Kung Fu Fighting or En Garde, the addition of a board and movement on the board helps give players more decisions that are not luck based.
The variant options also add depth to the game - particularly team play.

So much hilarious fun to play with my cutthroat friends. I fell in love with this game after I eliminated an opponent's character with a whack from a cast iron skillet. Player elimination that doesn't cause grievous festering butthurt because the games are so short.

RATING: 5
I would say that I enjoyed this game far more than Bang!, but it's still a game with mediocre decisions being made and your hand dictates how you will approach other players.  The only interesting element I like about the game is the cover spaces give different bonuses and there are limited spots.

Thematically speaking, it works very well since the actions and cards you play feel like you are in a fight.  Jumping from the catwalk into the floor just to bullwhip someone behind a bar?  Totally doable.

The teamplay element of the game is interesting, however the free for all leaves much to be desired.  Honestly, I prefer other fillers like Melee or Formula Motor Racing over this.

The comparisons to Bang! are inevitable, with the theming.  This one seems to suffer less from player elimination compared to Bang!, though that may be because we were playing in teams.  It would be fun to try the standard "free for all" rules sometime and see how they compare.

Take-that games usually don't tickle my fancy, but this one isn't bad. In fact, the way you play cards and interact with each other feels really similar to a game I really enjoy with the same theme, Revolver. You move around, you attack each other, and it all creates some very cool cinematic moments.

I was actually kind of surprised when I saw that this came from the same company that does the Red Dragon Inn games, which I loathe. While those games are just silly (But mostly just stupid), High Noon Saloon actually feels like a pretty fun little game. It does have a really big inherent problem that it shares with RDI, unfortunately, and that is that you don't really have much incentive to go after one character over another. I guess depending on the special abilities, you might pick on someone over someone else, but it would have been cool if there was some kind of assigned target system or if the person who has dealt the most damage gave you points for going after them.

Despite this, I think you could do a lot worse than High Noon Saloon. It works well for this kind of game, and the wild west theme fits right in with the mechanisms. I could definitely see ways to expand this game and make it better, but for what it is, it's a silly-fun game where you can run around throwing tomahawks at your friends before you bash them over the head with a chair and throw them out the window.

I played a "beta version" at Origins which I was told was complete except for the artwork, so the mechanics should be the same as the rules shouldn't change from the release version.

I would have rated it 8 if it were more "my sort of game", so really I only rated it lower because it's not the sort of game I tend to be interested in. The game is well balanced and well designed.

Feels entirely too complicated for what it is, and is competing against more familiar and better games.  For a dueling lifepoints style game, there's Magic.  For a Wild West battling game, there's Bang.

Yet another simplified version of Magic the Gathering. OK, it plays more than 2 players you don't summon creatures here. But the core of the game is powering up your character in your turn or block or diminish the strength of attacks of your opponents during their turn - very much like spells and interrupts in Magic. Unlike Magic, however, you don't have the chance to build a deck according to a plan, so the strategic element is mostly gone and the game becomes too dependent on the luck of the draw. 

In sum, nothing new to see here.

"Beer and pretzels" Western mayhem. The "terrain" of the board makes this game *much* better than lighter abstract "take that" games. Rules are a bit fiddly and take a little getting used to, but quickly learned once someone knows the rules.

Only problem I have with the game is finding miniatures! May have to use the "women with children" miniature as one of the figures! (:

This is a fairly light game, with a very large luck element. I did enjoy the added element of the board to this game. Having a relative position to others really helped make this game stronger. This is by no means a break through hit, but for a light, take-that, combat card game there are a LOT of worse choices.

Fun, pretty light game for 4-6 players.  I really enjoy the added dynamic of having a map you can move around and visually see positioning.  

There are quite a few finicky things to have to keep track of in terms of who you can attack, and with what, and hindered movement.  The multiple phases can be a bit cumbersome for a light game as well, but after a few playthroughs, things move pretty smoothly.

It's fun as a filler, or a quick-break game.  Especially enjoyable with the added team dynamic.

For the type of game it is, I think it does a respectable job being fun, and adding a few novel ideas to the genre of beat-em-up, player-elimination, card games.

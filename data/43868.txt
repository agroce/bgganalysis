Fun, but not as much as I'd hoped.
It kind of fell flat with my game group, mainly because they didn't like dying.  Their own fault, risking the lava with bad memories....

RATING: N/A
I'm reserving rating until I've played this more times. But initial impressions is that it is a very fun, Indiana Jones-style game. I love the theme, and the mechanics seem easy to learn and teach. This looks like a great minis style game for a beer-and-pretzels night.

RATING: 7.8
Simply awesome. The unique special abilities are sort of lame, but that's the only thing in the game I think could have been better (OK, the board is a bit too static, too). The traps, the bits, the simplicity and intuitiveness of the rules are all amazing.

The way that everyone can possibly lose the game is a great feature that I always enjoy in games; it makes victory just that much sweeter. The artwork is really great, too. Sort of reminds me of a more modern DungeonQuest style game.

It's just screaming for an expansion. One easy way to introduce new traps would be to make trap rooms that are the same size as the 3 on the board (the crushing wall room, the lava room, and the river/chasm room) that you can lay over the trap rooms on the board. Of course, you could just make entirely new boards, too. A list of possible variants or small pieces added to the board would be easiest, though.

Some ideas I'm thinking of:
-Jumping into the river requires a similar check to getting out, only you just have to ditch 3 treasures on a roll of 1. You can't die jumping in.
-All 4 trap glyphs are visible for 20 seconds or so at the start of the game, before they are turned face down.
-Draw 3 wall cards, first turn, 4 the next, 5 the next, and then 6 on the 4th turn.
-The space north of the bridge is a "slip'n slide" that moves you one space towards the exit for free.
-The boulder moves 1 space minimum, and the 6 treasure is really worth 9.

Lack of replayability is an issue, since the game starts feeling repetitive or samey after repeat plays.

Eh. Problems include severe problems with playability as a result of memorizing the tiles, rather boring game play... simply uninspired. Yeah, it's lifted from the Indiana Jones movie. Good movie, but the game is weak for me.

The kids didn't even like it. That's not good.

Nice game, well implemented theme, family game, very light. Risk management - push-your-luck, a bit of a memory game, but with very low replayability and slightly boring after the first few games. Very nice components and art.

RATING: 6
Fun game with solid theme. Two complaints: 1) they erred too far in the direction of globalized components, requiring a rulebook lookup for anything, and 2) The game tries not to eliminate players, but they might as well be dead. I think the game plays better and faster if death is final.

Great family game.  Theme is rich enough to keep the adults happy, gameplay is light enough for non-gamer wife to enjoy and 6 year old son to understand, bits are fun enough that kids want to play with them even when not playing the game.  The race against the boulder and fellow adventurers adds fun + tension.

In this funny game, you take the role of an adventurer who is trying to get out of a cave, but in the meantime collecting as many treasures as it can. But there is a catch, you have to exit the cave before a huge boulder comes dashing down and blocking the exit. The game itself features some funny elements, such as moving walls, a memory game (a.k.a. lava field), river rapids, falling bridges and of course the boulder. Exiting the cave becomes harder as you advance because the lot of treasures are hindering your movement and you become slower and slower, so managing this aspect is quite important. It is a funny game especially if you play with at least four players.

A quick and fun push-your-luck type game that's all about the experience. The components are top notch and the game delivers lots of fun. Great when playing with the kids or non-gamer family. It's light and fast enough that it doesn't get old. Nice game that does just what I needed it to do - provide a fun game that fits in a unique niche that I don't already have a favorite game for.

A gorgeous game, full of wonderful components, that screams "theme" at every corner... And yet, it's a luck-based dice-fest that gives you the feeling that you can't control anything. It's probably better with a lot of players, and gallons of beer, but still, this game falls into the very, very light category. And I'm not too sure about the replay value. All in all, a disappointment.

RATING: 6.5
This game is fun and the components are top notch. It captures the theme of franchises like "Indiana Jones" and "Tomb Raider" very well and is simple to play. 

The downsides are that it can get very old and "samey" fast so I suggest only playing it a couple of times a year to try and avoid it getting stale. The set-up time is also slightly too long for what is essentially a push-your-luck dice game.

RATING: 5
Great components, good artwork and attractive Raiders of the Lost Ark-style theming don't entirely conceal this one's limitations as a game. The Adventurers is a balancing act between grabbing more treasure than your opponents and racing for the exit ahead of a big boulder.  That's really all and, aside from a couple of random elements, it's the same every time. A game that absolutely cries out for expansions to boost its replay value.

Just played it to death, but never sell it, always good for a bit of adrenalin rush.. Problem being to me , I get tired of the characters and the lava room. I am working on a spider catacomb in place of the lava area as it's the weakest  and less used part to me.

A simple and fast adventure game for the whole family (well as long as they can get past the art for some of the women).  Exciting each turn due to the risks and decisions players are forced to take/ make.  Comes packed with great components (including a fantastic insert) which further elevate the overall gameplay experience.  Probably not a game which you'd want to play all the time (as its really just a simple press-your-luck affair), but is still very fun to pull out as a quick filler.  It can also be taught as you go as players really only need room info once they reach each area, but nevertheless it's really easy to pick up.

Only thing that would make this game better for me (besides redoing some of the art) would be to slim down the board size a bit and thus slim down the box size so that it would fit and look better beside my games of standardized Ticket To Ride box sizes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Can't figure out what people see in this.  There just isn't much game there.  There's a little push your luck, but I'd rather play Can't Stop or Incan Gold.  And there's an annoying memory element.  And that's about it.

I guess I'm just not a fan of big overblown games that make you think you're doing something by having you manipulate pieces on the board, but there's not many choices or interesting decisions to how those pieces are manipulated.  If bits are more important to you than gameplay, you might like this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game just isn't for us. It gets lots of hype from reviewers because of the theme. But to us it just isn't there. Sure the components look good but so much of it seems to be a random luck fest. Plus there is the whole memory aspect where in the first section of the game you look at tiles to try and determine where you can step safely in a later part of the temple. I HATE  memory games. So that was an almost instant turn off for me. But beyond that the game play isn't immersive or engaging. So this one is a pass.

This is a fantastic game to introduce people to the tabletop gaming hobby. It can be a bit difficult to teach to new or unfamiliar gamers though just because every room has a different and unique mechanical function. If you can get them to listen though, it's thematic, fast and has great components. Older folks will love the Indiana Jones theme and younger kids will love excitement and discovery.

RATING: 3.5
There are just not enough things to do in this game. Too few decisions and it is overall very luck based.

Plus points for beeing a quick and easy game, from which I do not expect the deepest kind of strategic gameplay.

I would probably rate it with 5 stars, if there had not been a major design flaw in the game:
In theory, you could learn the pairings of the front and back side of the lava room glyph plates. This would not be fun to do because the symbols are quite similar and hard to remember. On the other hand, if one player started doing this, you would have to do it yourself to be competitive as it would spare you four actions over the game (an average full turn).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
As a lighthearted adventurers game, this works pretty well.  It works hard to keep re-playability high through variable elements while still keeping to a consistent layout.  Game play is high on dice (and hence luck), but there are multiple options to apply that luck in different ways.  At its heart though, its really a push-your-luck mechanic that drives the game.  How long can you stay, how much can you pick up and carry, etc before fate catches up with you.  The game seems to play a bit better with more players than less - likely because the joking and social interaction (i.e. boasts and bragging) make the experience more enjoyable.

I love the concept, the game plays fast, but I think the balance is a little off. Some of the fun mechanics almost never come into play because of the pacing of the in-game timer and the lengths of the different paths. The cool little bridge almost never makes it into play, and the speed of the boulder can really make a game difficult for everyone, depending on the dice rolls.

Probably one of the most theme-driven games I've ever played.  This game is like Indiana Jones in a box.  I love the simple mechanisms and the great components.  This game is fast and has a ton of fun to offer.  You just have to be prepared to accept the fact that luck will play a major role in the game, because there isn't much strategy involved.  But don't let that scare you away, there are tons of decisions, because at virtually every step along the way you will be forced to decide how much you want to push your luck.  Will you sit 4 spaces in front of the giant boulder, or will you risk jumping in the river even though you're loaded down with treasure?  These type of decisions will determine how much danger you want to put yourself in.

You see the Adventurers is all about the story.  What you will remember are those moments when someone is barely able to drag themselves from the river before falling down a deadly waterfall, or when someone narrowly outruns the giant boulder to avoid being trapped for eternity.  Winning and losing seems to become secondary to the story of what is happening.  If ever there was a game where you will try to salvage "moral victories" this is it.  Sometimes just getting out alive is enough to make you feel like you accomplished something.  Come for thematic fun and everyone will be satisfied.

(Thank you 2009 Secret Santa for the AWESOME game!)

One of the things I love about Adventurers is how easy it is to explain.  I talk about the basic rules and the first two rooms, and off we go.  Once we get to the locks, I explain that, once we get to the river, I explain that.  Everything just flows together.

As for the game - brilliant theme and execution.  Sure, there is a ton of randomness, but enough room to make choices that might tilt the odds in your favour.  While the gameplay is nothing special, I really *feel* like I'm navigating the dangerous temple, outrunning the boulder, etc.  Plays quickly too.

The downside is, if you were to play it often, the fire symbols would be a little ~too~ easy to memorize, which would take away from the whole point.  But, as a once-a-month fun filler, Adventurers nails it.

(KIDS) Fun game of pushing your luck.  In my first play, I fell into the lava and grabbed the golden treasure off the bridge with my 2nd adventurer with just one plank remaining.  I scored 18; my son (5) picked a bunch of locks for 21 points and my daughter (7) grabbed multiple treasures and escaped for 22.

This game has seen a lot of play since buying it at Gen Con.  Pretty simple, but I really like the load vs. actions mechanic.  Also fairly short, the boulder chasing you keeps things moving.  Plus watching Pat go over the waterfall every game never gets old.

Not a bad game, lots of fun with plenty of push-your-luck, it just seems to be over-engineered for what it is. For me, you could have had the same fun with an identical car game that was 1/4 the price.

A very simple, fast and fun game, The Adventurers has everything I love in a game, which means beautiful miniatures, dice, theme, randomness and luck: it’s quite repetitive though and thus would really benefit from a modular board that allows to change the way it plays out game after game.

Do you like Dungeon Quest? Fireball Island? Or even Ghost Party? If you do, then you should enjoy this exciting filler. Players are adventurers who are trying to steal the Mayan Rain God's treasures before the temple's traps ensnare the players. The temple is a collection of memory tests and press-your-luck stops. Like Dungeon Quest, grabbing a few items and leaving alive may be the best strategy—but (like Ghost Party) the fun is in dodging the traps as that stone boulder rolls ever closer...closer...CLOSER! Probably best for younger players, but I had a devilishly fun time for my first game!

This was going to be hit or miss with me - unfortunately after one play clearly a miss :(

Game play is decidely lacking - very repetitious and given all the lovely bits not as thematic as I was expecting. Characters are totally bland, yes you get a one game special power, whooopee do, I'd much prefer more differentiation, the fast one, the lucky one, the tank etc ...

There's no 'thrill' of exploration here, just roll some dice, move, draw cards, rinse repeat ... dull, dull, dull. For a theme game of dungeon/tomb robbing, DungeonQuest beats this one on all fronts, for a fast family game of treasure hunting Incan Gold beats this on all fronts.

Considered getting it for the kids - won't bother.

Lovely bits, searching for more of a game. I'm guessing it'll be expanded with expansions, maybe they'll help?

Temple of Chac is a well-produced game that looks great on the table.  The figures, board, and plastic pieces definitely add to the adventuring mood.  The game itself relies mostly on several push your luck mechanisms, with a dose of memory thrown in.  This is not a thinking person's game, but it does offer moments of tension and is the right length for what it is.

My 7 year old likes Temple of Chac quite a bit, and requests it occasionally.  He is able to play on his own, although I do provide commentary on what his options are and why they are good or bad.  My 5 year old is not quite ready to play on his own, but is capable of playing with some adult help.  The only issue when playing with kids is that your adventurer can be killed / eliminated (and this happens fairly frequently), in which case you pick another adventurer and start over - although you really only have a chance if everyone else also dies.

Lo probé por primera vez en la escapada al CiberChigre de Gijón, en Feb 2010. Resultó muy entretenido. La copia que probé además, tenía los componenetes pintados magistralmente por su dueño (kintawro).

Se trata de un juego en el que hay que escapar de un templo evitando diversos obstáculos y haciendo acopio del mayor número de tesoros posibles. Hay que conseguir llegar a la salida antes de que te coja la bola rodante, al estilo Indiana Jones. Otros obstáculos son las paredes que se cierran, las losetas con trampas sobre el mar de lava (que se pueden evitar si inviertes tiempo en averiguar las pistas_), la catarata y el puente. 

Entretenido y recomendable. Yo lo probé para 6 jugadores y lo pasamos en grande.

RATING: 7
Great little game with fantastic components. I wish they were still selling the pre-painted miniatures, but alas, I guess I'll just have to paint them myself. The theme works really well and provides a tense, press-your-luck style of game with many ways to die. It is also very approachable by all ages and gameplay is easily understood.

Player elimination is usually funny enough that it doesn't detract from the game (which runs fairly quickly) but the static map means the game could get repetitive after a while. Overall, I really enjoy The Adventurers, and I look forward to playing it again!

RATING: 7
similar in style to Dungeonquest.  As a result, you can't go into this game with a serious mindset.  It's an  adventure and needs to be played that way.  But there's a much better chance of survival compared to DungeonQuest, so in that way, a better game.

Theme makes this a pleasurable ride (race). I rate this for its sheer thematic pleasure. Playing the game is  fun, with a race against the clock (or the big boulder), means greed for extra treasures will likely cost you a life. Each area of movement through the underground temple provides for something different to consider for picking up treasures or moving toward the exit. Great fun, as its not too hard to make it out, but players are pushing their luck to have the most treasures and win the game. This is one game where unlucky dice rolls are enjoyable - watching someone fall down the waterfall with a load of treasure; or a futile effort to pick a lock with the boulder bearing down on the character...

This brings Kings Solomon's Mines, 30's pulp adventure and Indiana Jones to life as a boardgame. You want to escape the Temple, alive, with the most treasure. But balancing your greed and staying alive can be tricky.

Plays up to 6. Players can choose to be 1 of 12 adventurers. There are 6 special skills, so 2 adventurers have the same skill, that can help you get through the temple. If your adventurer dies, you may choose to respawn with a new character. Most tests are resolved through chucking dice.

Once you get the hang of it it plays fairly fast. Really nice art, very tactile game and just a real blast to play. If played a lot successively its replayability could drop a lot as it may get very repetitive. Rotate it in and out as a fun fairly fast filler.

Beautiful, fun kids' game with a neat theme and an exciting timing mechanic.

Otherwise, this is a must own if you have kids, or have friends or extended family with kids. Very limited replay value, though.

At about 5 plays, fatigue starts to set in a bit ... this is a great design concept and is great in execution in many ways, but the replayability just isn't there. Not enough nuance to the risks, and too many "blind alleys" - it seems like it's basically all about the treasures in the river and keeping your load level down until very late. Anyway, still a fun game, but after a certain point, the kids are the target audience here.

Again, this was fun. Not one that's going to make it into regular rotation, but as a quick, light, press-your-luck game with good theme, this was fun - a good cross-over type game. I'm not dying to add it to my collection since a friend owns it, but would not turn down an occasional game. Much more succesful than the various incarnations of Diamant/Incan Gold/etc.

I guess there was some fun here, but I couldn't help but feel that Viva Topo (which is a childrens game) offers a quicker, simpler, and more fun experience for the same type of game.

Both games have the same push-your-luck aspect, where the goal is "grab what you can before getting swallowed up by the impending threat".  This one just adds more chrome without really any type of payoff.

Basically you're re-enacting the first scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Surprisingly fun considering it's one-note premise.  You have to balance your innate gamer-based sense of greed with the need to keep your load light enough to outrun the boulder.  Very much fits the "I don't need to be the fastest, I just need to be faster than you" mold.

I can see this game being good with children as they are running away from the big boulder screaming, but it's really an interesting game for adults as I think it's too simple and luck-driven (the cards, dice), and even though it has some very cool pieces which means the visual presentation is awesome, the gameplay isn't that good. Also (even though I've only played it once) I felt that, nearing the end of the game, the game played out the same way so I got kind of bored, and this tells me that the replayability is very low (for my taste that is). I admit that it was sort of fun/tense when the boulder started to move and you had to weigh the decisions of how many treasure cards to hold i.e. how greedy you are, but other than that the game mostly felt a little boring.

I like the Indiana Jones theme and the dice-rolling mechanics. Overall quite luck-based but gives some scope to try different routes and strategies.

Superb title - my push-your-luck dice-rolling title of choice. As for my gameplay preferences (action, adventure, treasure hunting) - this has it all.

A little more variety in artwork on the treasure cards might have been nice, but this is just a negligible nitpick.

Fun family game!  I think the mechanics and theme blend really nicely here.  Certainly, it seems very difficult to win, but half the fun is the tension resulting from realizing your death is imminent but trying to thwart it anyway.  Excellent components, good artwork (mom's perspective, though -- why must 3 of the female explorers cards be drawn with so much cleavage?  Really, is this necessary in a family-type game?).  Theme hits the sweet spot of my 8 yr. old.  Recommended (with the caveat of the artwork mentioned above).

---------------
Super fun game. This is not an "adventure" game like Goldland or Lost Valley. In fact this is not a game to be approached as any sort of intellectual competition. It's simply meant to be a fun simulation of the first 10 minutes of Raiders of The Lost Ark. And it does that really well. Enter a tomb, run through it collecting treasure, get out without dying. Die by getting squished by walls, falling into lava, falling off a waterfall, having a bridge collapse under you, or of course getting squished by the boulder. Or even letting the boulder get ahead of you, thus blocking the exit and being unable to exit. Only getting squished by walls hasn't happened in our first three games (in one evening). In fact with 4 and 5 players, the most players to ever successfully even get out of the tomb in a game was two. And that's even with everyone getting a free new replacement guy after your first one dies (although you lose your treasure, so you don't want to use it if possible). The game plays well under the rated 45 minutes, unless maybe you play with the full 6 players. There's nothing terribly mind blowing here, but I do like the action and encumberance system. There is a single group action "potential" determining the number of actions each player can have this round, but based on how much treasure you already have, you [i]might[/i] get fewer actions than people with less treasure. Works quite well. As does the boulder that lumbers along with varying speed.

Push your luck games and I don't tend to get along well, but this one has enough options that I got pulled in easily.  Sleekly designed components shine in this game.  I think my main concern is replayability - will it get old after several plays, or will the puzzles and choices available keep it fresh?

SOLO PLAY:

1 Player Minimum

Solo Play if you just want to get a better score than a previous game.
Should I get out alive....or get 1 more treasure? The feeling of unease as you press your luck just one more time is nail biting. That is what makes this game so much fun.
More brutal then the Pyramid of Horus because the possibility of instant death awaits your every move.

A hit with my daughter, although only played twice so far; I am eager to try it out with adult gamers.

I really like this filler. Great pieces that will draw in non-gamers and the gameplay is simple and fun. Some people don't like the fact that a game can be determined by a roll of the dice, but the dice are usually not that pivotal. All in all, I think the fun outweighs the luck.

Indiana Jones in a box.  A very light game that anyone can pick up easily and have a blast with.  There's cool bits, plastic minis and dice... what more's to ask?  If you like painting minis, they are highly detailed.  I can't wait to get mine finished and to the table.  Even though it plays light, there are plenty of good choices to make, so its good for gamers and non-gamers alike.

I like the theme, but somehow the choices along the way seem weak; you have to run quite fast to keep ahead of the boulder, so the lava field doesn't see much play.  Seems like a straight race where the first out of the temple almost always wins.

It really is Indiana Jones.  My family loves this game, the rolling boulder alone makes it great.  It may seem there are limited options to win the game, but we have found that winning in this game is not the main goal.  We've had safe-crackers try and pick up all of the treasures in the coves, we've had swimmers make a run for the river and sit there picking up everything before anyone else gets there, and we've had smarty-pants decipher all of the glyphs and pick up stuff in the lava room.  All great stuff!
The deaths are hilarious.  When someone gets run down by the boulder, or takes a chance and steps on a sinking floor tile, or picks up too much treasure and can't pull themselves from the river!  My kids think it is great.  Great game.

Better of the two Adventurers games.

Looks great, tastes crunchy. Sorry for the detour into 70s advertising lingo, but this game does feel like a blast out of 70s gaming. There's lots of dice rolling racing for the end of the board, drawing random rewards and pretty plastic bits. Its really not very far removed from The Green Ghost Game.

As such, its good fun with plenty of laughs, as long as you dont take it too seriously and dont play too slowly. Otherwise it out stays its welcome quickly.
I suspect the rules could have been a bit better since its really a very straight forward game despite the appearance to the contrary when perusing the rules.

The Adventurers is an enjoyable roll and move push your luck game despite its long set up time (long for what the game is, anyway).

Players are adventurers doing the Indiana Jones thing, recovering artifacts from a Mayan temple.  Simple game where a player is given a certain number of actions each turn - it tends to drop the more treasure you're carrying.  Actions are spent on movement, or recovering treasures.  Along the way there are some puzzles to solve and about six traps to avoid - it's quite easy to perish by lava, closing walls, giant rolling boulder and so on!  Surviving player who makes it out with the most treasure wins.  Wonderfully produced game, simple rules, and an infectious adventure theme.  It's not deep, but does tell a good story and provide some nice tension.  Enjoyed it.

Played once so far, all the players died, within one turn of getting out. The last player ended up behind the boulder, right after the water path and asked a q we couldn't answer, "can I run. Past the boulder and get out?"  He had he movement points, but.....

The board and cards have nice art and graphics. The miniatures are nicely sculpted but one has to paint them – it gives a better look to the game. All players are treasure hunters. The map has many traps, pitfalls and encounters, enough to put you out of commission. Also, along your adventure, memorizing some ancient glyphs can help you bypass lava traps and create a shortcut. At various points, ancient artifacts are awaiting your arrival. Unfortunately your backpack cannot hold them all. So, not only has one to choose the right path but also the right artifacts (the most precious). And on top of all a giant rolling boulder which is about to pulverize you and block the exit of the temple completes the whole theme. Lady Luck has a lot to do with your survivor.  Fun interaction, smooth and easy play.

This feels like a more polished version of a game I would have designed in 7th grade.  Theme is great, components are great, and the general theme of risk/reward and push your luck is well implemented.  However, the game also feels disjointed because every section has its own rules.  While there are decision points along the way, which way you go has more to do with what you feel like exploring rather than any strategic imperative.

I get what this game is trying to accomplish by providing a theme-rich sense of adventure.  However, in the push-you-luck genre, I derive more excitement and sense of agency from less theme-intense but more mechanically focused games, such as Diamant, Exscape, or Can't Stop.

The  more I play this game, the more I realize how much of a shame it will be that this will be forgotten to time. Though there isn't anything groundbreaking in the design it is just exciting! The game "clock" being the boulder is every bit as exciting as the movie scene that inspired the game designers. The Lava Room is such a clever little mechanic but flawed in that a person can memorize the tile faces, or at least the unique traits to easily identify the trapped tiles. The game is just exciting and fun which is about as strong of an endorsement I can give.

Fun and thematic, the game definitely gives you a sense of "hurry, grab treasure and get out of here fast" mixed with the greedy temptation to carry more.  However, the rules are not quite as streamlined as I would hope for a thematic temple run game.  It's hard just to jump right into it without refreshing yourself on all the little rules.  Because of that, it fits more into the category of 'it's a fun experience that you should play, but not one that I will consistently come back to'.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This game was really boring despite rolling boulder, deadly lava pit, and raging rapids - all things that scare me to death.  I felt the rules for this game are heavier than the mechanics justify.  

You're pretty much just rolling and moving every turn, trying to figure out where you want to stop and search for treasure.  The board locations have their own specific rules and add a little flavor, but it really wasn't enough to draw me into the game.  I feel it would need to be either heavier or more streamlined to draw me in.  

I can see kids really getting into this game though.  It has a Fireball Island sort of feel to it, but perhaps not as punishing.  It's been 20 some years since I've played that game, so my perception of difficulty then was certainly a lot different.

RATING: 6
Ah, this game comes [b]so close[/b] to greatness that its shortcomings hurt more than they should. The Adventurers is dripping with theme, leads to excited cheers and yelling around the table when a player narrowly escapes death (or falls into the clutches of a deadly trap) and is an absolute blast to play. 

The mechanic of moving more slowly when weighed down by treasure forces players to make a hard tradeoff between points and survival, and there are plenty of opportunities for nail-biting escapes -- which practically invites you to retell your adventures after the game. There's a lot of luck here, but it's used well and doesn't matter in the least for affecting gameplay. Sometimes the dice will hate you, but here it never leads to frustration.

And yet...there are some serious flaws as well. Probably the biggest is its replayability. I have no idea why Alderac went with a single board instead of a modular one; after only a few games the "escape the walls, climb over the lava and surf down the waterfall" pattern of traps grows routine. The ability to change up the order of the traps would give The Adventurers some much-needed variety. And a modular board makes expansions possible, something this game could really use to keep things fresh. From a design standpoint, it's baffling.

The first trap in the game (the closing walls) aren't nearly deadly enough. Players almost always have time to look at the lava tiles, grab a treasure or two and escape before they slowly grind shut. Removing a few of the blank wall cards should fix the problem and add to the tension of fleeing with little information or pushing your luck and trying to uncover all of the lava traps.

The lava pits are a great idea -- well-executed and exciting to play. But after a few games the patterns become etched in one's memory, and there's a lot less possibility of accidentally screwing up and uncovering the wrong tile. I'm not sure how this could be rectified; I wish the game had come with more lava tiles to add additional uncertainty. Also, the first person across the lava will usually gain a huge lead on the other players, both in points and in escaping the boulder.

Speaking of the boulder, I love the concept and very nearly the execution. It's a great in-game timer and leads to breathless anticipation as players await the die roll to see how far it will travel, hoping it won't crush their adventurer flat. And the fact that it picks up speed as it moves is thematically great. But its top speed is too slow. If you get a good jump at the beginning of the game it's easy to outrun the boulder. I wish it would continuously increase its speed instead of topping out at the sixth turn. There needs to be more pressure on players to flee; several of the games I've played have ended with players leisurely strolling out of the cave after picking up armfuls of treasure. When the boulder moves consistently quickly, it's terrifying. But it should be doing that every game.

Another problem I have with The Adventurers is the death rule. If you die you'll start either at the beginning (or halfway through) with a new adventurer. But by that time you're very likely out of the running, picking up the scraps of treasure from whatever your opponents have left behind them and sometimes even starting behind the boulder. You're not in contention, and I'd rather just have player elimination than have to try to start over.

There are three more minor quibbles: the bridge is rarely used (due to the lackadaisical nature of the boulder and the rewards in the river). The 6-value treasure alcove should be worth more points for the difficulty involved. And there's almost no way to interact with or screw over your opponent. This kind of game is crying out for ways to mess with other players, but the gameplay is too tame.

I really do encourage everyone to try The Adventurers. It's a lot of fun to play the first few times, the components are fantastic and there's more theme here than in most other games. But it feels like the first draft of a finished game. Alderac is supposed to be releasing a sequel later this year, and I hope that they'll take the opportunity to make some changes. If so, the next game should be a classic.

[b]Rating based on - 4 plays, 2 player -3 player[/b]
Love - the theme, graphics, minis and components
Not a fan of - the player elimination

Was instantly attracted to this game due to its resemblance to the Indiana Jones movies. The game is simple enough to learn and plays well, but the BIG bummer is the player elimination. Now that I have known and loved German style board games, where the winner is not often fully decided to the end, it's a pain in the ass to sit though a game where you are doing nothing (due to falling prey to one of the traps), and having to watch the other people take their turns *yawn* while you hope that the boulder lands on one of 2 specific spots so you can get back in the game. 

In general I really like the fun this game generates but in the end it was a deal breaker for me that this was how the game played every time. I like everybody to feel included all the way through a game and it was just plain weird in a 2 player game for one person to keep going while the other one waited to get back in the game.

I bought it based on all the positive reviews.   Also because my son is an Indiana Jones fan and thought I couldn’t go wrong with the purchase (this may still hold true once we play it).

I delay in playing it because upon opening the box I thought the components were just...meh, and thought the game play would not meet the hype it got (but, we’ll see).

Good Indiana Jones-style game where you make a mad dash through a booby-trapped temple in an attempt to grab the most treasure and get out before a rolling boulder seals the exit. The rules are a little long and it takes awhile to teach but once you know what you're doing it's a fun little romp that's over too quickly. In fact, it's probably too short for the amount of time it takes to learn it.

I never give .5 ratings. NEVER. But I will make an exception this one time. The game is a 6 for me, pure Ameritrash, not my cup of tea, but not awful (or awfully long). But the production values are very good, and for what it is, it is very well done. It almost makes me wish I *did* like Ameritrash more, because then I would love this.

RATING: 7
What fun!.  Follows the Indiana Jones story nicely with the boulder being a clever time keeper that picks up speed as it rolls along.  Adventurers that get too greedy die, as 4 out of the 5 of us did.  You come back into the game with a new character but getting ahead of the boulder is almost impossible.  A nice looking game that plays quickly.  Just fun.

I love the theme of the game and it looks very inviting when set up. But every time I play it the boulder moves way too fast. Carrying more than 3 treasures is pure suicide in the games I have played so far. This removes most of the interesting decisions from the game involving pushing your luck and such. I think it needs to be house-ruled that the boulder only moves on 4 and higher. Also 3 blank cards need to be removed from the wall cards because those walls move way too slow.

RATING: 6
This is a very light game. It was entertaining with two people and felt very much like the Temple of Doom. We tended to be too greedy and never had an adventurer escape with any treasure. We lost both plays. The game feels like it needs a little of something, but as it is we enjoyed it and the quick play and short game length along with random factors that determined the length of a single game. I would say for a lightweight game this ranks high and would be a great intro game for non-board gamers. The rules are light, the complexity is light, and you don't really have to memorize a single rule. Initial start-up is quick as well.

A risk vs reward game with player elimination that successfully recreates the thrill of trying to get treasure out of an ancient temple before it traps you in there forever (or lets a boulder roll over you, drowns you in water, lets the bridge fall apart, squishes you in collapsing wall, orfallthrough a pit of lava and die. 

Brilliant game whose only real drawback is that it might feel too samey over time. Maybe. I'm willing to go till I reach that point, however.

Finally get to play this, and its not as bad as I thought!  Theme is just yes, yes, but the game is light.  However, this is a time where theme wins out, and there will be particular light silly times when you reach for this.  I'm sure after a number of turns there is an optimal strategy, but this is a game to play lightly with laughs to generate stories, not to AP to win.  When play again, I think would include vartiations, to encourage more search glyphs and using lava searches (Rating 7.261, Dec 16).  UPDATE: Decided I will never play this again, too scripted and just not my type of game (despite the theme) so gone Rating 5.741, Feb 18)

A fun push your luck game with great components and some Indiana Jones kitsch and nostalgia.

My dry, jaded gamer side would describe this as: "A light, themed roll-and-move with some push-your-luck and a memorization minigame."

The kid side that plays games because they're fun describes it with: "It's got an Indiana Jones boulder! And a lava room! And treasure!"

Excellent for family game night :)

Warning: player elimination can make this frustrating if the game lasts for too long though it rarely does.

I love the art. I love the bits. I love the theme. That said, I always felt something was missing or like most games played exactly the same. That said, we always had fun with the game and it was a great game for the family and for beginners. The only reason we traded it away is because although we enjoyed playing it, if someone else wanted to play it, we would most likely never pick to play it ourselves. So for us its one of those games that we would prefer someone in my game group own so that we can still play it, but not take it home.

I bought this at GenCon 2009 with the painted figure set.  AEG only sold 100 copies at GenCon so I had this game for a good five months before it was in stores.  Although a simple "push-your-luck" game, I enjoy it as a box of toys with rules.  Have since "upgraded" from the AEG edition to the FFG Revised Edition just so the box is a proper size.  Kept the painted figure set though.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A very fun game with a great theme. This game accomplishes just what it was meant to. Yes, there is some possibility to memorizing the tiles, but the chances of that happening seems slim to me. Unless you're playing with a total jerk. Who feels the need to win every game he plays and decides to try and memorize them before playing with others. Which isn't that easy of a task to begin with. Since the patterns on the glyphs are mildly complex.

The game is alot of of fun to play and offers a lot of laughs on the way. The bits in the game look great and are very well made. The theme flows very well with the game and gives it some extra flavor along the way.

The only thing that I was turned off by was the artwork. To me, the gameboard could have looked a lot better, than the bland board we wound up with. Also, the box graphics look like something created by a Disney wanna-be. I'm glad to have picked this up, as I did have my doubts, after hearing all the negative things about memorizing the tiles. I wouldn't straight out recommend the game, due to the varying nature of people, but I would highly recommend that you at least try a game or two, before deciding on whether to purchase this game or not.

The Adventurers is clearly geared for families and would probably be a favorite with that audience. Fantastic production values (especially with the pre-painted minis) and a strong theme will appeal to everyone, but an all-adult crowd might be annoyed by too few decisions, too much dependence on luck, and too much repetitiveness. Since my husband and I play most of our games only with each other, we rate this game as a 5. However, it's good enough to keep in our collection to play with our imaginary (as of now) grandkids.

Thanks to my Secret Santa, I can now give this fun-looking treasure-chasing game a try with the Lady.

This hits the fun spot just right. It's quick to play, doesn't require any brain-burning strategy, and with such cool components, it makes it a very fun, light family game.

If you abhor luck, or randomness, then don't touch this, don't look at it, and certainly don't play it. This game is nothing but luck of the dice, and luck of the draw. Despite that, it's fun for all ages, and has just the right amount of chrome.

The minis are simply fabulous, with superb sculpting on every single one. This game simply begs for paint, which I'll have to get to soon. It's too bad they didn't up the price tag a bit, and included pre-painted components, as this would have put the game right over the top. I know there's a separate pre-painted pack, but having it all-inclusive would have been much more prudent.

Thanks again Secret Santa!

Not normally my type of game; it's almost the dictionary definition of Ameritrash, or one of those 1980s family boardgames based around theme and components. Dice rolling, plastic minis, individual player powers, separate mechanisms for different places you visit, narrative led... Almost the nadir for me.

However, it's a decent game to play with kids, or even with grown-up friends, due to the theme, not taking itself seriously, fairly simple rules and straight-outta-the-80s atmosphere. It's also not interminably long.

My main criticism would be with the female characters, which are not great as role models in a kids' game - like the worst tendencies of 1980s or early 90s RPG art still somehow with us.

The game has lots of potential, but I can't get past how walls closing and the boulder moving is so slow that I'm not concerned by the possibility of being trapped or crushed.  The symbols on the tiles are tricky, but if I played more than once per year, I think I would remember the symbols too easily.

It is tough to work a puzzle into a game and koodos for trying, but it doesn't quite do it for me.  I would look for the thrill and excitement of a '40s serial cliffhanger, but I don't find it in this game.

I won't go out and buy it, but I will play it with friends that do see the adventure in the game.  It's one of those situations where good gamers can elevate an otherwise unappealing game.

A pretty light push yer luck game (sort of a big-budget board game version of Diamant), with a slightly cheesey theme that is a take-off of the Indiana Jones scene where he's outrunning a boulder.

It plays pretty quickly... we took less than an hour for a 6 player game with 4 newbies (some fairly new to our type of boardgaming). With experienced players it could clock in at under 45 mintues.

Some say it's lacking in re-playability, but I'd say it does have some... the game plays out pretty differently depending on the speed of the boulder and the number of actions you get (based on die rolls).. and there are 6 different character powers, which allow/require you to play differently.. plus the moving wall cards and treasure cards add more randomness to the game.

If your group are prepared to ham it up, and just have a bit of fun with it, I would recommend it.

I love a random effect, it gets really boring to be able to calculate out everything all the time.

So, the pure dice feast isn't a problem with me.

But, I'm not 'in love' with this game.

I think there might be not be 'enough' different things to keep me interested on repeated plays.

But, what bothers me the most is, that although I'm not the type to count through the decks of cards for number of this or that (after 40 games of BSG I still don't know the % chance of activations for example), the Lava Room Mechanism bothers me.

So, for those that don't know. The first room has collapsing walls. You can stay in as long as you feel lucky. In that room you can do two things. Search for treasure. Or look at the clues to which four stones in the lava room are traps and will give way to the lava pit.

The Lava Room is a series of tiles. There are two sides. One with an glyph or detailed pattern. Some are slightly similar to others. On the back are lines and dots. There are two sets of these tiles. One set with yellow lines and dots and one set with 'grey' lines and dots. Other then that color they are identical sets. The yellow set is randomly placed in the lava room with the dots and lines face down. Then 4 of the grey tiles are randomly selected and placed in the wall room. So, as you are walking through the Lava Room you flip over the tile to see if it matches a tile that was in the wall room. It it does, it's a trap and you die.

When you where in the wall room you could have taken actions to look at the other side of the tiles to see the pattern that 'goes with those lines and dots'.

That's the problem. They lines and dots 'go with' the patterns and that's going to be true all the time.

There are going to be a 'segment' of people that will go through the tiles an memorize with patterns belong to with lines and dots. And then there are even some people like Charles and maybe even Alex that I'm sure will remember that kind of thing without even trying.

So, after a few games there will be some that will be able to run through the wall room without wasting actions on clues and then run through the Lava Room without worrying about traps because the previous room has already told them which ones are trapped.

Anyway, it's a bit of a bother to me. Although the mechanism itself is neat.

Over all it's a cute game. And although I'm not 'in love' with the game I'll probably play it more as it plays up to 6, it will play very quickly, and I think Alex really liked it.

Sag, help them come out with some expansions (a more random Lava Room would be fun ;)). Expansions would be fun for this, but they will need to be 'cheap' ones.

Una peli de Indiana Jones (o un nivel de los primeros Tomb Raider) hecho juego de mesa. Con sus paredes moviles, sus jeroglificos, y su bola rodante que aplasta todo a su paso (y que hace de cronometro, porque la partida acaba cuando la bola llega a la salida, taponandola). 

Es un juego entretenido, sencillo, para toda la familia (bueno para introduccion al mundillo), estetica cuidada y buenos componentes. 

Quiza flojea un poquillo que es demasiado facil morir, lo cual en cierto modo contribuye a la rejugabilidad porque el juego es corto y no tiene multiples escenarios, pero lo hace un pelin frustrante. 

bien para introducir al genero, para una tarde de domingo y como juego familiar. como juego "para jugones" se queda un poquito corto. y en su "subgenero" prefiero, con mucho, al dungeonquest.

The theme and components work very well here. It has a great Indiana Jones feel to it. Players navigate their adventurers through a temple with all kinds of traps trying to bring out the most treasure. 

The components are excellent here. Nicely illustrated, good thick tiles, and lots of plasticky goodness. Some of the women don't really seem appropriately dressed for tomb exploration, but I guess that adds to the campy appeal.

This is really a pretty lightweight game, and the various rules would seem to be overcomplicated given that. In actuality, it's very easy to teach because each section of the board you get to just has different rules and you can learn as you go along. It's really a game of risk management, but you also really have to watch how many treasures the other players have. Sometimes you can win with very few treasures if everyone else is greedy and ends up dying. 

I was initially worried about the replayability of the game given the memory element and simplicity, but it's held up pretty well so far. I'm very happy to have this on my shelf as it is one of the more thematic gateway games in existence.

Cool, easy going push-your-luck game with fantastic components that just flows very well. Yeah, it's lucky. Yeah, a modular board would be nice. Yeah, there's almost no interaction. But as it is, it's a fun 30-minute romp with great components and lots of laughter.

(1 play, 5 players) We all died and had some laughs when it happened. It's light and random, but quick moving, tense, highly thematic. Our greed brought us all down in the end, with all five players being sealed inside the temple. Everyone agreed that was the best possible ending.

It's good fun, but becomes familiar quite quickly. And if the boulder is slow, the all-important tension won't build properly.
The special ability Stamina is way overpowered. If everyone plays safe & sane, Stamina win's everytime.

But nevertheless, if people start dying it's hilarious & it is quickly played.

RATING: 6.5
The Adventurers is a lot of fun with the right crowd, but to be honest, three games of it was probably all I'll need. You move your adventurer around the board dealing with challenges and uncovering clues as to which paths are safe and which are deadly. You have a certain number of actions per turn, which can include moving or interacting with the environment. I'm largely hanging on to my copy for when my son is a little older - I think it'll be great with kids.

Can surprisingly get non gamers to the table. I enjoy sitting down with it because it is thematic, but it has almost no variety or replay value.

RATING: 8
Purty as hell and has all the hallmarks of a classic Ameritrash filler:  cool minis, art above and beyond the simple gameplay, death and humiliation.  Looking very forward to this one, with expectations set to "appropriate".

Of course, the fact that this didn't come with pre-painted minis caused me to run around my mother's basement in a rage, wearing nothing but stained tighty-whities and red-faced indignation.

UPDATE:  A ton of fun with the right mindset, e.g., played quickly as a simple push-your-luck filler.  Played conservatively, thoughtfully, carefully... it blows.  I've taken to screaming [i]"RUN!!!"[/i] at people who treat their turn like they're setting up a [i]zwischenzug.[/i]

Also, the boulder is the primary source of pressure in the game—when it's really rolling the game is tense and hilarious as people get popped and grease the kinetic groove with their innards.  When the boulder rolls are low, the opposite is true.  The game lags horribly.  This makes the experience kind of hit or miss depending on those rolls.

In spite of these flaws (boring with conservative play and bad boulder rolls) [i]The Adventurers[/i] hits the mark, at least as an occasional amusement.

Played three games in a row the first time out and a lot of fun was had by all.  I've played several more times with the same results.  The theme is brilliantly matched to some nice mechanics.  The special abilities make things interesting, as well.  I've managed to get a set of the painted figures and find they add to the atmosphere.  If nothing else, it's easier to tell the different characters apart.

This game is a wild romp, with lots of theme, fun, and risk-taking. The production value is first-rate, and the rules are pretty easy to understand. Can't wait to break it out at game night!

I've only played with two, each controlling two explorers with a backup. It provided a little extra information about the lava, which is probably why both my characters survived.

I got this direct from AEG, along with the painted minis.

A good push-your-luck game with mechanics that matches the theme very well. May be a bit hard to table due to the numerous components but something that can be gotten used to. Would recommend that the first game be played with special abilities to get players used to the various components of the game. Must play with more than 3 players to evoke the fun and laughter with a push-your-luck game.

Fun and cheesy race game where you push your luck trying to gather treasure (until you can't move) while trying to stay ahead of the boulder (end game timer).  Memory puzzles, dice rolling challenges and gambling on how long you have to grab things & toss low value treasure.  Silly fun.  Re-play is limited (because it's always the same), so this may hit the table only once or twice a year.

the game has one challenge that's very fun but optional - memorize glyphs now to get through a room later. Said room is also optional. After that, it's a dice race to beat the boulder. 

We had one player who died in-between the wall and lava room and had to wait two turns to come back in to play again.

The pieces were of decent construction though the actual game was less than desired. Perhaps if there were one or two more levels of the temple, then it would be fun.

I really like the game and have had fun with it.  My family, however is simply not interested.  Very sad because it looks so cool!  I suppose the main criticism is that it is fiddly and house rules need to be implemented in order for it to be playable.  One example is that the walls never close before the bolder makes it past the walls.  The walls are never a hazard. This makes no sense and I'm suprised the game was released with that issue.

The two of us who tied for 1st place (5 player game) both took the conservative approach... basically ran through 1st part w/out looking at clues and only picking up one treasure each in that corridor, then we both ran round the lava pit and both picked up a 4vp treasure, and both jumped in river and picked up as many treasures as we could there making sure to get out in time before boulder rolled around (we also both got lucky and didn't neither of us rolled a 1 when trying to get out of water which was very painful for Eric as you lose 3 treasures before you can try again)

I really wanted to like this game, I was told the game was superb but after playing it I can say I don’t like it. It is far too random for my liking, the theme is awesome but the game is about who will be the luckiest player. I think the game can really work with kids, but not with me. I won’t be playing this again.

Same general idea as Dungeon Quest....Get out with a much treasure as you can.  However, this didn't seem as threatening as Dungeon Quest.  I think this one will need an expansion or some way to randomize the "rooms" to make it interesting for repeated plays.  As it is, I think this could be a good game to play with kids in the 8-12yr. range.  Very good production - nice components.

Mixed feelings about this one. The actual gameplay is fun, but I always have to reread the mini-rules for each corridor of the board. Teaching is a pain too. Some sections of the board are pretty pointless as well. I've never seen anyone come close to being crushed by the walls or fall from the rickety bridge. Running from the boulder, picking the locks, remembering the lava symbols, and trying not to drown is fun though.

Getting through the first room with the moving walls doesn't seem too bad. The lava pit seems annoying. There are four traps and maybe you got to look at one hint.  If you die you can start again, but you lose all your treasure, so we just ignore the death by lava. Why is it that Ameritrash/Thematic games like to kill you? This is almost entirely a game of luck.

Weird overproduced euro yahtzee, oddly themeless. I don't think I would play this again unless I was the only one who didn't want to.

I Dislike:
* The uderwhelming combination of mechanics
* The lack of distinction between the characters
* Role dice - rinse and repeat
* Memory mechanics are a pet hate

RATING: 6
Simple, light game that reminds me more of the silly board games I played as a kid than of the meaty, strategy games I like now...and I don't care. It's glorious. Is it too simple? Yes. Is it painfully derivative of Indiana Jones? Yes. It is also quick playing, novel, interesting, beautiful and, oh yeah, FUN. Would be way higher if I felt like getting it to the table a bit more often but even as-is (where I will admit, I only want to play it maybe once a year when I'm in the right mood) it's fantastic. Only thing holding it back is the lack of variability that keeps it from hitting the table until I "forget it" a little.

A fun and light game.  I think it plays better with more people as there is more chaos and a greater feeling of urgency.  Not a game I'll want to play everyday, but with the right people and under the right circumstances, it will get a lot of plays (i.e. in a social setting/non-gamers/filler).

Finally played this after owning for several years. It's a nice, light, adventurey game that probably would not withstand too many plays but that is nice for a novelty and went over well with my 14- and 12-year-old daughters. Components are well-done, fun, and immersive. The character art is, well, more than a little ridiculous and often objectifying, but the game is over-the-top itself. Decision making is pretty limited. Luck level is fairly high but can be mitigated by balancing greed and loads carried, as the more you are laden down with treasure, the harder some checks become and the fewer actions a turn you are likely to receive. I like the idea of the second character being available as a mulligan of sorts for when one of a player's characters dies, but my second one died, too, and it seems as though one either doesn't die and has a chance to win or dies once and either must escape quickly (and lose) or try to catch up somehow on treasures (and probably lose). Still, it's a fun game and plays in roughly the advertised time. The setup is a touch more extensive than I would like for a game of this length, but all in all it's worth it . . . for a while.

This was one of the first games that I played when I was introduced to board games. It may not be a very good game but it introduced me to some of the friends that I hold dear. I liked the adventuring aspect of it and watching the boulder is amusing. Don't expect too much from this game as it is the essential filler game.

Complaints:
The lack of any real strategy and I never liekd the segment with the river because everyone plopped in instead of trying to cross the bridge because they were loaded down with gear. It needed some more player interactions in my opinion.

RATING: 5
Based on first playing, the rating would be 7 or 8. However, the game cannot be enjoyed more than 2 or 3 times. A friend of mine commented on this, and I agree: After your first game, you've seen all there is to see.

Granted, the theme and fun factor is pretty good. But it would be like rewatching the same 30 minutes of Raiders of the Lost Ark over and over again. The story simply doesn't change.

Great Light family fun game.

The Good: One of the most highly themed games ever. The components are fantastic; some of the best ever. Great family game, where the kids can play and have a chance to win. But, I must admit that I really enjoyed it as an adult.

The Bad: It all comes down to rolling the dice - so you will not enjoy if you are adverse to luck in a game. It plays just a little long for what it is - but not that much. I do not like the looking at lava tiles and trying to remember the glyphs. The glyphs are also the hardest thing to explain - some will not understand until after they have played the first game. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Simple, fast beautifully made game. Components look fabulous, the pace is very fast thanks to the boulder, there are a few strategies of getting a certain number of treasures and then running away with them. The only downside are the abilities of the Adventurers, the linguist (or polyglot) seems to be superior to all the rest. Nevertheless, I really like playing this game.

My friend John asserted that there are really only two ways to play this game--Either you spend time in the wall room and the lava room or you dash through the wall room and past the lava room to pick the locks at the alcoves and then scour the river (making a second trip down the river if there's time for it). Ho hum.  At least the bits are pretty.

Indiana Jones. Går an å gå ulike løyper til mål. Karakterane sine evner er ikkje like nyttige, så visse løyper blir brukt for mykje og andre for lite.

Adventurers is a neat little game of pushing your luck. I overdid it and died right before the exit in my learning 2P game where i played both players. the other one got crushed by the boulder and pushed his luck too hard by acquiring three  treasures only to see the exit of the river blockked by the boulder.


Well learning by the rulebook was okay but they could have made it easier. Rulebook is fine though as no mistakes were made.

A very light dice-roller, basically a fun simulation of Indiana-Jones-style temple robbers. Players move through a Mayan temple, risking constant death while trying to get to the exit, carrying as much treasure as they dare. The more treasure cards you have, the fewer actions you might get this round. If your character gets killed, a second one can drop in and you may still get enough treasure and escape to win.A mix of very basic lucky dice-rolling, lucky card draw for the treasure, and some decision-making about possible risks. Beautifully produced, with 12 small but detailed plastics miniatures, and an exotic and deadly temple. Adults may tire from repeats of The Adventurers, but kids will get lots of thrills.

Visually attractive and mildly challenging family game. There are some strategic choices to make, some family style dice-rolling, and I could see a family with kids under 15 sitting around the table for this one. Sadly, all the characters perform the same, look so similar unpainted that they lose whatever flavor was left, and the game choices you make are not that interesting. Plays in around 45 minutes, so just about right for what it is.

RATING: 3
The game engine is not bad - just that not enough for any wargamer.  It is for kids, I understand but we are talked into a game when there is time remaining after a day session. The game is obviously based on Indiana Jones setting where there is a big rock rolling coming and people (they are not in a team) running for the exit while picking up the treasuries along the way in secret chambers, trap passage and riverine.  I don't mind this sort of gaming with a good theme but hardly would find it interesting to buy or play again.  It is a good game for the kids, training them to be logical in their choice while calculating risk probability - the adventurers could die in a trap by stepping on the wrong place tile of the runes - the one you've seen and "memorize" in the starting chamber, where the walls from both sides move in to trap the people (the pace of that is randomnly determined by card draw), or they could die in falling into abyss when they fail to roll survival die while in river.  You can drop the treasuries in your bag to unload and roll for a higher chance of survival.  That's basically is what the game about.  You either like it and enjoy it with the kids who share the same vision and theme with you, or you don't like it because there is simply no variations or strategy but pure mathematical calculations.  They are not hard to calculate though. Victory goes to the one who survives and of course, collects the treasuries with most value.  At $31, (best price here in BGG) I certainly won't buy it though.

Looks like fun, but isn't. Incan Gold is a fine push your luck game.  This isn't push your luck - it's who will be the luckiest in getting the highest random total of treasure cards. That would be okay if the journey to get there was fun, but it isn't. Although it seems as though there are fun diversions for players to risk, the reality is that the diversions are dull and 95% of the game consists of running ahead of a boulder.  Again, that sounds like fun, but the fun didn't translate from the potential to the playing.

Incan Gold also provides for a great social dynamic. This has none.Unsatisfying game that seemed it should have been fun for both family and gaming group play.

RATING: 7
I was hoping to get a good thematic game, one that I could possibly play with my parents, and who can resist Indiana Jones?

The first thing we noticed were the components---there were a lot of them and they were pretty good quality.  I especially liked the giant boulder.  Unfortunately, my wife's initial enthusiasm began to damper a little as I started to explain the rules.  There's just a lot of little things to keep track of, especially for your first play.  To be fair, this will probably get easier with more plays.  Despite the handful of dice, the game wasn't as random as I feared---there were interesting decisions on keeping treasure or lightening your load, whether to check for traps or to push forward, with the boulder inexorably pushing you towards the exit.  

I liked the game, but it wasn't my wife's cup of tea, especially after she died in the lava room.  I can see how it can feel same-y after a while.  Also, I think these types of thematic games really shine with a group of people rather than just two---there are more people to cheer the random events in the game and there's less annoyance with passing the dice between each other every turn.  As for thematic games we've played, I think it worked better for us than [thing=35815][/thing].  However, it's definitely not a game that I think I can pull out with my parents, as there are too many little things to keep track of.  For a simpler game with similar theme, I'm excited about trying [thing=37759][/thing] with them.

This is the most boring game we played at Essen yet. Unanimously voted by the 5 seasoned players that played as a total stinker.

Game plays as follows:

Move. Make some not very meaningful decisions. Roll a bunch of dice and hope for the right combinations. 

Repeat. If you are lucky you die early by getting rolled over by the stone ball.

Play first before even considering to buy that one.

Try to get the painted minis instead, they are great.

Thanks to AEG for making the painted minis available. It's the attractive part of the game which got me interested in the first place. They really should not show the painted minis at their web site, nor in the rules, since they are not included in the box. I would not have bought this game without the painted minis - I have plenty enough games already.

I expected the game to be much better! I have a proper audience for this game, where it will shine, but generally speaking... not so great. I am happy to play this because of the silly fun.

Absolutely hate the memory aspect of the exploration tiles. Would enjoy an alternate approach. We do something with cubes to keep track of what people remember so they don't actually have to remember.

This was pretty enjoyable. Lots of push your luck which I normally don't like but you're also in a race to beat everyone else to the treasure. I am concerned however that certain elements will become old hat after a while, particularly the lava room. After a few plays I could see someone being able to pass up the wall room entirely because they have learned which tiles have what symbols.

A light fun game where you roll dice for actions and then decide whether to move, search for treasure, pick locks, etc.,  It's fun w/ the right crowd.

Treasure slows you down though, so you have to be a bit selective.  Surviving the traps and getting out alive with the most treasure wins the game.

RATING: N/A
A very light dice-roller, basically a fun simulation of Indiana-Jones-style temple robbers. Players move through a Mayan temple, risking constant death while trying to get to the exit, carrying as much treasure as they dare. The more treasure cards you have, the fewer actions you might get this round. If your character gets killed, a second one can drop in and you may still get enough treasure and escape to win.

A great light game.  Top notch components.  Simple but surprisingly deep risk/reward game.  Can be played seriously with adults or with children.  The only game I've played that's just as good with or without alcohol.

6 for the components mostly. I played with a friend, and he died at the waterfall. So close!

This game just didn't grab me, and was too fast.

Maybe will try again while having a few beers with more players.

DO NOT WANT!

Between rolling the dice for movement, rolling the dice for lock picking, rolling the dice for getting out of the water, rolling the dice for crossing the bridge, rolling the dice for treasure values, rolling the dice for the boulder movement, drawing random cards, flipping random cards for wall movement, and flipping random tiles, this is just not my type of game.  Too much luck, not enough decision making. 

Also, quite overproduced.

We have only played this a couple of times, but it accessible to grandma, so it will definitely hit the table again.  It's so much fun to watch as people sprint away from the boulder, or to watch someone try to take a short cut and plunge down a raging waterfall!!!  Fun for the entire family!

A good party game that is worth pulling out every once in a while to relieve the itch of an adventure game. However, the inconsistency of the boulder makes the game go from extremely exciting to completely boring. It's also easy to memorize the signs after a couple of plays, making the lava area not as exciting as it first was. Overall, a fun game.

Not bad at all, I mean, pleased to see a boardgame like this one today, with rolling boulders, old temples and treasure quests. 
But it's just a half achievement: too many cards, treasures very easy to get (use 1 action, automatically get 1 treasure), a '3D' board that actually I can't buy as 3D. Beautiful characters (maybe a bit too on the fantasy side) but why so many? I would rather just reduce the number of miniatures and work on more 3D components for the scenario.

Played for the first time on game night (7/28).  Went over very well.  It's fun for what it is, a light game.  Not a ton of critical decisions to be made.  My concern is that you could "memorize" the tiles, thus taking away the suspense from the lava room.

I like this game conceptually more than I like actually playing it. I appreciate that it was the first Adventurers game but I like the second one better. This one feels mostly the same whenever I play it, and it feels like there are fewer tense decisions. You are either grabbing tons of treasure or dying a grisly and sudden death.

09/29/12 Played a three-player game. Not my cup of tea. Its too light, fluffy, and silly for me. It was OK as a half hour lark. Frankly when we began I strongly considered running around the lava fields until I fell in, just to exit the game quickly. But that would have pissed the owner off, so I didn't. Though I sure would have done it if he'd said it took more than 45 minutes to play. I was only playing it to humor him. Sure, it looks nice with the painted figurines, moveable walls, giant stone ball, and all. But its not my kind of game. Winning with 28 points didn't make me like it any better. I got lucky, whoop-de-doo. Hopefully I'll never have to see it again.

A brilliant and fun system with marvelous props, ruined by a static board. Less and less fun with every play, especially because the setup takes more time than the actual game, and there's just not enough choices to keep up the interest. Let's hope for a modular expansion with much more variety, because the base system and the artwork deserves a more meaty game.

Game in a Nutshell:  Scurry through the temple grabbing up as many treasures as you can while avoiding booby traps and try to get out alive.

Played as:  2,3,4,6 players

Pros:  Grade A- presentation (only docked for not having pre-painted minis).  It’s a good press-your-luck family game. The idea in this game is great and one that should still work in a setting where the experience is more important then a tight nit design.

Cons:  The game seems to have a predictably short life-span.  The rules take longer to explain then it takes to play.  It’s tough when just a little bit of bad luck completely eliminates you from contention with the waterfall at the end being the worst offender.  You can play a fine game, jump in the river with everyone else, and a few rolls of the dice right before the exit can swing the game dramatically with no chance to recover.  The lava pit is a disappointment, after a couple plays it’s easy enough to recognize what’s distinguishable between the tiles.  

Other:  I have a feeling there will be some positive changes when the sequel comes out. If I had to do it again, I might have waited to see how the next Adventurers is received before committing to one or the other.  This is one of those games that’s quick enough to play multiple times in a row (and might gain the requests to do so from people just learning it) but doesn’t stand up to the repetition.

Best Use:  A light hearted press-your-luck romp to bring out every once in a while.

I could see myself getting bored of this after a few plays. Very interesting game, however I would think it would be better if the game had a variable setup or possibly unknown routes which would make the game more exciting, suspenseful (what occurs up ahead kind of feeling) and replayable (of course I can see that this wouldn't work out for the boulder rolling across the board). Like I said interesting game, though I wish there was a little more.

This is an okay game, because of the theme and the bits, especially if you're playing with a child. Sadly, I am not a child, or it would be a lot easier to get away with some of the stuff I do. But it's so light and simple (I'm referring to the game, but some of you were thinking that I am light and simple, which is also true.) Most of the "choices" are trivial, or you don't have enough information to do anything other than flip a coin. A few interesting ideas don't necessarily make for a good game in this case.

I'd play this over most of the Euros I've tried, just because I'd rather pretend to outrun a boulder or cross a rickety bridge than jockey for the right to become chief latrine inspector for the new emperor. The experience isn't ultimately any better, I suppose, but I can at least sit back and laugh about the boulder chasing us around. Noting that the theme is more evocative than in the typical Euro really says more about Euros than about this game. That's why this gets a 5 instead of the 4 it deserves: I'd pick it over all but the very "best" Euros any day. 

It's a children's game marketed for adults. Come to think of it, that describes a lot of light Euros.

This was quite an entertaining game!  Played really quickly, and just about the right amount of tension.  Even though my first character killed right away, I still managed to win, so obviously not a lot of strategy.  Think it would have limited replay value, but quite a fun ride while it lasted.

I enjoy the game, even though I probably wouldn't spend the money to buy it new. It's a fun family game, and definitely has theme oozing out of its crevices, but ultimately suffers from a little too much luck to take it seriously. Still, it scores well on the fun factor, and that's enough to entertain me regardless of what happens while playing it. Maybe if the price comes down on the secondary market to $15, I'll give it a shot with the family.

Simply an awesome game! Not for those who prefer gamer games though. Easy to play gateway game with loads of theme a la Indiana Jones and 1930's pulp adventures. Luck yes and that makes the game as you have choices to make depending on some luck of the dice. 

The painted minis are outstanding. The whole game is a work of art. Real push your luck choices to be made. Will appeal to most other than those who live for brain burners. 

Needs a 5 point track to keep up with the speed of the boulder until it gathers full momentum and perhaps a token to pass to each person who controls the dice rioll per turn. 

Some of the variants on BGG add even more fun. Looking forward to expansions!

Dripping with theme.  Impossible to play without humming the Indiana Jones theme tune.  Overall playing experience can be quite uneven.  I strongly recommend:

This game is light, super light in fact but it is an experience game so for me it doesn't really matter.

You'll either like the game for the oohs, aahs, groans and laughter or you won't. 

Central mechanic falls around risk taking (carrying too much treasure) and that weight impeding on the number of actions you have each turn.

This is great family gaming fun and good for adults that don't take life too seriously. Don't see myself or my boys getting sick of this one. Expansion temple boards would be welcome though.

Temple of Chac has great components like it's predecessor, but is a little more linear. The boulder as a timer will be fun and familiar to anyone who has seen the Indiana Jones movies.

If you can only get one game I'd say get Pyramid of Horus over this one, but only by a small margin.

This game really reminds me of Incan Gold on steroids.  You are characters inside a temple trying to escape it with the most gold intact.  There are boulders, traps, lava, and many other devious ways to kill your character whilst gathering up treasure.  As you pick up treasure you get weighted down and cannot move as fast, so there is a bit of risk vs. reward going on.  Lots of dice are rolled, but the results are pretty predictable in that there should not be HUGE swings leading you to death because of crappy die rolls.  

The game is a really quick play, with lots of dice and gambling.  A fun and enjoyable way to kill your friends.

It's wildy unfair, but plays so quickly that if the dice screw you over you're not going to get too bothered.

Wow, after all these years Indiana Jones recreated in a fantastic board game experience! A fast game experience that can end in so many different ways! It takes a bit of explaining to newcomers...which I notice no one really has patience for...when there is so much eye candy before them! A fast quest for treasure in a game that seems to have nice replay ability due to the movement of the boulder!

One game had all six of us accumulating treasure nicely, only to all be sealed in the temple by the boulder...well all accept for myself (one step from victory) squished by the boulder.

Kudos for the great theme and components, but man, so many rules for such a little game. And petty unnecessary chrome as well eg 1 adventurer gets an extra space once during the whole game. Like that has a big effect! In what turns out to be an exercise in rolling dice in different ways all throughout the game. The only decision each turn is whether to dawdle and pick up treasure cards or to run - because you can't win if you don't beat the rolling ball home, and it speeds up as the game progresses. So it's a game of continual risk judgement. Not bad, some light fun with the theme, but not a buy given the component cost either.

Super fun adventure game! We own and love Escape, and this is very similar except with a slower pace. Love the iconic boulder chasing down the players. Sadly, I did have to do a little selective editing on several of the female characters as they were overly sexualized and had their bits popping out all over the place. *sigh* Other than that, the only thing I would add is a Indian Jones soundtrack for ambiance!

RATING: 3
Edit: I think I'm missing a tile. No idea what happened to it as I've only played it in 2 spots, neither of which it was found.

Wow, the production quality on this game is wonderful. The boulder is a huge chunky piece, the walls are thick although a bit unstable. The miniatures are nice and the artwork is well done. The gameplay however is just mediocre. Without the production values backing this game up, I think the game would easily be forgotten about. It's a simple push your luck game. My one play of it was fine, although we did have someone get knocked out early on and couldn't respawn for a few turns. I'd play it again, but I wouldn't actively choose to play it. I do also think the tiles could be learned fairly easily for the lava room traps.

RATING: 8
Ever wonder what it would be like to be Indiana Jones exploring a temple of treasures?  Well, this game attempts to simulate that experience and does a great job.  From collapsing walls, to deciphering puzzles, to teetering on the edge of a lava pit, to swimming in a raging river headed toward a waterfall, to crossing a rickety bridge, to yes, even escaping a rolling boulder.  The Adventurers is a wonderful press your luck style game of exploration and treasure gathering.  Your job is to grab the most treasure from various places in the temple and escape alive.  (I have died than I have escaped).  This game has excellent components and unique elements.  The "load level" system where the actions you get become less the more treasure you have, forces you to make some strategic choices.  The theme is wonderful and it is a riot to play.

Good tense treasure hunt-try to escape game.  I can see it getting repetitive very quickly for adults.  For those kids who enjoy the ghost chasing them around the corridor and rooms in the game Mystery Party (also called Ghost Party), I think they would graduate to this and really enjoy it.  I can't see playing this with my adult friends except for some light entertainment (with a few cocktails), but I would think kids 8 - 14 would really enjoy playing a game where they are racing through an underground trying to get as many treasures as possible without getting schmoosed by the boulder rolling after them from behind.

My initial feeling is that this is a great game.  I love push-your-luck games, and this has that mechanic in several different forms.  No grand strategies, just lots of short-term decisions about staying around for treasure and risking getting squashed, flattened, burned, drowned, dropped, etc.  Simply fun.

RATING: 7

Very good party game. Although game contains many cards, figures and tokens, gameplay is smooth and easy. It takes only few minutes to explain the rules and everyone is ready to play. Watching others or yourself being killed, just because one was to greedy this turn, is always funny. Especially after a beer or two :)

At the first glance the game looks quite repetitive but each time it's quite exciting not to get killed in the temple and carry as many treasures out of it. Or at least more than your friends.

Game is very random. This randomness can only be driven by one's greed level. If you don't expect too much from this game it will be nice filler / party game to play from time to time.

RATING: 6.9
This is based on 1 play through,as you know it take's a lot from the game as you have to learn the game yourself while teaching other's as you play.
But we pretty much had it down by the end of the game but it really seem to work well,The boulder was within a space or 2 from us by the end,and the points also came very close.
So I'll be trying to get it to the table very soon to give it another go,knowing the rule's and im sure the rating will rise. 
I wish either the board was a little bigger with more to do or at least a double sided board. A turn counter would have been nice so you can keep track of the first 5 turns as I think we forgot once or twice what turn number we were on "it matters up to the fifth turn as you have to roll that number of dice to move the death Boulder!"

Entertaining, if brief, romp through an Indiana Jones-style temple of doom.  And, boy, is doom inevitable.  Highly random, and full of disappointment when your character is run over by the boulder, or you chose the wrong lava tile and become a human BBQ.  
It is a bit over produced...the mini's are beautiful, and the walls/boulder/bridge is cool, but it feels a little unnecessary for what is basically a dice fest.  
It's fun, but I think I prefer Relic Runners, which has a similar theme, but a bit more thinky and a lot less rolly.  If you can get it really cheap, and you like your games with tons of American flash, you probably wouldn't be wrong to pick this one up.  Otherwise, best to pass, most likely.

A very light family game with lots of luck and a good theme. It is very dependent on dice rolls, but there is a small amount of planning and strategy involved. I like the Indiana Jones (ish) theme and the components are great. I don't like the high level of luck, and the fact that the board is the same every game. There is some randomization of the treasures and hazards, but it seems like it would start to feel samey very quickly. I wouldn't mind playing it with kids who are very into the theme, but there are many games I'd rather play with adults.

It could have been so great...
It's enjoyable, thematic, simple and friendly. Enticing for kids and adults. The bits are amazing (we painted the minis and the girls like them much more).
But unfortunately the bunch of good ideas it also has are poorly delivered into the gameplay. It seems as if they didn't playtest it at all:
The closing walls, being a nice mechanic, are not a threat as the boulder comes always before they close. Some paths to treasures (like the river) pay off much more than others (that get unused). The (repeated) character abilities are so unbalanced, etc.
Some house ruling could help, but it's fun anyway.

This is a great game if you are looking for a light-hearted quick game with a few laughs thrown in.

I played the Adventurers with my two sons, now ages 10 and 7 as of this writing.  It held their interest throughout, and they really enjoyed all the great pieces that come with the game - especially the boulder.  Game play is simple enough that they could learn and play the game quickly.  This will allow us to play this one often as we typically have about 1 hour to squeeze a game in before they head to bed.  We finished our first game in around 30 minutes - but that was likely due to the fact that the boys just couldn't help pushing their luck trying to grab lava room treasures.  They managed to incinerate both their primary and secondary heroes in short order, but they had a lot of laughs and both agreed they wanted to play again soon.

This is a fun family adventure game. However, it should not be taken too seriously.   The game is more about the journey than the final outcome.

What really great is that it's not archeological game that pretends to be a high strategy game unlike Thebes.

You are an explorer who starts the game in a near death situation. You have no treasures at this point and you must collect as much treasure as possible while trying to escape the deadly temple. Basically, you are Indiany Jones.

Several adventurers exploring the Guatemala ruins. I didn't find my fun in it actually. The rolling stone seems very fast, and the advanturers are very vulnerable (a bad dice-roll and you're done). In this case, it is too dangerous for the Adventurers to collect treasures, which makes quick-running the only strategy. In the end, the fastest runner (who escapes with only one cheap treasure) wins.

   [b][i]Exceptionally[/i] nice package.  I had the opportunity to play with the painted characters and that was a nice upgrade as well.

   In spite of the nature of this game's theme it is designed to keep luck in its appropriate place, even when considered on the very narrow scale generally enjoyed by the denizens of this web site.  Most luck in the game will have more impact on the overall narrative than any individual player, and will therefore give each play of the game a bit of a spirit of its own.  Hidden treasures keep you guessing a bit, and with multiple paths to the finish (literally that is, not figuratively) you have good control over your own fate, and ownership in a game such as this is key.

   What appears on the table before you is a fun romp through a slice of Indiana Jones-style adventuring.  Plush pieces and simple rules make for a quick startup and larger-than-life play, making it ideal for kids and grandparents as well as seasoned gamers looking for something different even if it only lasts 30 or so minutes.  After you've bent your brain cells on a play of 'gric or PR this game will be just the tonic you need to get smiling and laughing at each other.

   The only drawback to the game in my mind is its length -- THIS much fun needs a bit more time to play itself out and that means it's time for expansions baby!  Different treasure cards and special player powers could be pumped out on the cheap and in short order, but I want boards.  BOARDS!  Modular design would be a lay-up to add on to this critter and would make it every bit as valuable a property as Heroscape or BattleLore have ever been.  Modular design could let you purchase a bit here and a bit there, and people could combine their copies to build grand sets.  Given the theme, the sky is the limit.  I look forward to the swinging pendulum trap.

   AEG found the bullseye on this one.  If they're smart they'll gently eject the casing and fire again at the exact same target.  I could blow $150 on this title and not regret one penny of it.[/b]

A fun adventure game, players trying to sneak through the ruin with lots of goodies and come out alive before the giant rock block the exit. The mechanic with the traps are fun but I was hoping the ruin would be more different everytime we play, I hope the future expansions will add extra traps on the floor.

RATING: 7
The decision in this game is fairly straightforward for the most part. This is the type of  game that you don't want to get better at. Just play with your gut. In a sense, you can memorize the tiles so you don't fall into the lava or you can find a strategy that will ensure you can escape in time. The game is pretty fun in my first two games but I think it will get boring at some point since there is no different setup. I think it is a good gateway games for non gamers.

I'm not sure if I would want to play this with a group of adult gamers on a regular basis, but I have had a lot of fun playing it with my 7-year-old son and nephews.  A great game to play with kids.  Rated from that perspective.

It is very random.  One game the walls and/or boulder barely move and you have tons of time and then the next game they crush you on your third turn. Our first game was with 4 players and we all made it out without a problem with everyone scoring around 30 points.  We all felt like it was too easy. The next game was just two of us and we lost 3 of the 4 characters and the winner made it out with just a couple cards.

This is a lot of fun, mostly based on pushing your luck. 
The only problem is that you shouldn't play it too often or it becomes repetitive. However, playing it only every few months makes me forget all the rules and I need to look them up again. And that's a problem because the rulebook is pretty bad for rereading, it's so linear.

This game recreates the first scene of [i]Raiders of the Lost Ark[/i], in which Indiana Jones tries to loot and escape from an ancient indian temple lost in a forest, boulder included.

Don't get me wrong, I like hard games, but Adventurers seems just a bit too hard. Great components and board but some of the play areas feel unbalanced. It is hard to dislike a game with a giant boulder...

RATING: 5
While the concept seemed clever - find the treasure, avoid the boulder, don't go over the waterfall - the game just can't quite pull it off.  First play was interesting, but I really question the replayability aspect for anyone over the age of 8.  It would seem that after the first few times the symbols on the back of the lava tiles would be recognized and remembered, taking away one of the biggest challenges.

It's not a filler, but feels like one. Easy to learn and play, but still very fun and exciting.

RATING: 6
Only one play and one of those times definitely shouldn't haves learned a new game so late at night.

Thematic and great components, but pretty much purely luck driven.

Would play better once you know _how_ it's meant to be played (in our game most people rushed towards the exit) - but really needed to spend more time early on picking up treasures.  Not quite sure what the idea of having the 2nd character is about - they aren't gonna be competitive with final scores that's fer sure - just a bandaid for the player elimination problem (which we also had... then they couldn't re-spawn because the boulder hadn't traveled far enough!)

But not bad family fare - just don't expect there to be too much strategy here.

Will revisit though.

[BGCOLOR=#FFFF00][COLOR=#000000]Family.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Adventure, Action Point. Nice themed game with some clever mechanics.

Due to the nature of some of the mechanics, Adventurers does not lend itself to frequent, repeated play. 
That said, once or twice a year, it can provide you with a supremely thematic push-your-luck romp through the pulp-adventure ruins as you try to grab as much treasure as possible. There is danger lurking around every corner, and a Raiders of the Lost Ark-esque boulder hot on your tail.

[i]Wants to be Light Hearted, Fun, and Oldschool, but Lacks Good Gameplay and Replay Value[/i]

I appreciate them trying to make a modern day Fireball Island... but I can tell after just one play that replay value is a crippling problem for this one. It is what would typically, in a modern board game for adults (not saying that is what this is, but its the standard I judge it by), be an OK scenario -- one chapter in a larger game.

Instead, the OK scenario is the entire game. So the entire game is not only just "OK", that mediocrity is short-lived. The kiss of death for a game like this that is supposed to ooze awesomeness and excitement. It might be more fun and dramatic if all players are in the mood and play risky taking chances at every step of the way, but good games are designed to extract this risk-taking from the players at the table through incentives, and don't rely on the players to cripple their strategy to have more fun.

The only thing worse to me than an "OK" game is an "OK" game with bad replay value. And after seeing what it has to offer I feel like playing even a second time would be too much.

This was a fun and easily understood game. When characters die it is usually amusing and everyone laughs and has fun. Its tough because you want to be the one with the most treasure but you also want to avoid being crushed by the giant rock rolling after you. All-in-all, this is a fun game and I would enjoy playing it again!

As of 3/10, Lorelei loves this game. Both times we've played we've gotten a few rules wrong, but it has still been fun.

After playing a couple of more times, I'm really enjoying this game. A two player game with a friend clipped along and we finished in about 20 minutes with both of us crushed by the boulder on the last possible space. And after having played some more, I realize that there is no way I'm going to memorize the symbols for the lava room.

Four plays through and I've played with two players all the way up through 6.  While it's definitely a better game with more players, I'm starting to see how there is some replayability problems.  Sure, expansions are being made, but I wonder if the game itself is good enough to invest the $60+ into it.  I've also found the game a little difficult to teach as it's a bit fiddly with mechanics that require you to roll a '3 or less' here and a '4 or more' there.

A simple, fun game of push your luck in an Indiana Jones context.  Great components (even if you/we didn't get the painted minis), and a programmed game system using cards (like an ultra-lite Arkham Horror).  With closing walls, a river and waterfall, booby-trapped stones on a lava pool, and the obligatory rolling boulder!  Very simple to learn and play - although the rules booklet makes it feel more comlicated.  Setup takes a little while, but the game still comes in under an hour.  Great with kids, or with adults wanting to chill out.

Not bad, but I don't need to own it. 

A light game of Indiana Jones: explore the temple, grab the treasure, and get out before you get crushed by the walls, burned by the lava, drowned by the river (waterfall), dropped by the collapsing bridge, or squished/trapped by the boulder. There is a lot of randomness (die rolls for movement and lock picking, cards for wall movement, 4 random tiles collapse and drop you into lava) but it is somewhat manageable: you control your load level (which modifies dice for movement) and and you can spend time researching (to try to memorize the 4 dangerous lava tiles). The special powers are ... not that special. Still, a light and fun family game or filler.

Needlessly convuluted structure to the rulebook -- rules could have been on a single page.

This game is too light, random, and linear to matter. Your decisions amount to pushing your luck a little bit and not much else. It even has a stupid memory aspect that makes NO sense. Remember the runes? You're an archeologist... WRITE THEM DOWN! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This game is cute, probably good family fare, but not at all for me and my sensibilities.

The game is played by traveling through an obstacle course avoiding traps and collecting treasures which are the victory condition in the game.  The more treasure you collect the fewer actions you get each turn and the harder traps are to avoid.

Like I said, it is a fine distraction but if you look too closely you can see two major flaws with the game.  First of all, 90% of the game is dice rolling and I've since learned that while I enjoy rolling dice, it shouldn't be the lion's share of a game's mechanics or it really just becomes a luck fest.  You might as well play a game of "everyone roll some dice and whoever rolled the highest wins".

The other being that the turn order can really just screw some people out of the game, making them even more victims to poor luck.  All things being equal there are points where someone who gets somewhere first gets that treasure and others are without.

The only decisions a person is really left with is which path to take and when to use their once per game power to greatest effect.  One good thing I can say about this game is at least it's short.

The Adventurers!  Fun filled light game where you play an Indian Jones-style adventurer running through an ancient cave of traps and hidden treasures.  All the while there is a boulder following behind you picking up steam ready to crush any too slow adventurers.   The adventurers gamble, spend actions trying to acquire treasure; spend actions stepping on stepping stones in the lave pool (where some are traps but yet others contain treasure); or they can simply run!.  The adventurers get slower the more treasure they are carrying and the boulder gets faster as it picks up speed.  Getting out alive with the most treasure wins the game.  

Super quick, light, easy, immersive, low replayability, but all in good fun.

For serious gamers, this game is all dressed up and nowhere to go. It's extremely light, and the decisions are far from brain burners. Diverting once, maybe twice, but that will be the end of it.

It would be a great choice for non gamers or youngsters who love Indiana Jones-style adventure. The components are gorgeous, especially with the painted figures (sold separtely), and the theme is extremely well integrated. Setup takes time and attention, but the rules are simple and the game plays quickly. Even for its target family audience, however, I can't see it getting nearly as many plays as [thing=13004][/thing] or [thing=2653][/thing].

This one popped up and I figured I needed to add this to the collection myself. Oh well, at least I got it cheap. For norwegian prices, that is. Anyways, will update my rating after I've gotten a couple of more games under my belt.

Great components and good/simple underlying mechanics.
The final result unfortunately feels like a 1 scenario adventure game.  It gets stale real quick.
If they would have made the game modular and expendable ; it would have been a great game.

RATING: 6.5
The game is a lot of fun and great for playing with kids. The theme is very well done. I don't mind the large luck factor in the game, as I think it adds to the excitement and tension, which is really what the game is about. 

The only reason I don't rate it higher is that games feel too similar pretty quickly. The one-time-use character abilities aren't enough to differentiate the games for much replayability. So, it's great for playing once in a while, but not for back-to-back plays. I ended up making a homemade deck of variant cards (using some of the ideas in the forums as well as my own ideas), which helps a lot in increasing the replay value. I think an official expansion would be very welcome.

RATING: 5
Light game of Indiana Jones-style tomb-raiding adventure feels like a reasonably good idea (race to score points ahead of the boulder) poorly executed (all the methods to score points suck and it's too easy to die). Re-playability is limited due to the static board -- I'd be much more interested in a modular version.

Seems best to play while drunk or below the age of ten.

RATING: 5.5
Good theme play and fun.  Easy to learn and play.  Good gateway or family game.  Replayability may be lacking because even after two plays it does not appear as though there are many strategies. Components are very good - very functional mounted board, thick chits, & plastic playing pieces.  Cards were a bit thin but not used heavily.  The rulebook was in color and well organized.  Game time is extremely short - around 20 to 30 minutes.

Great fun game fills the same bracket for me as Chateau Roquefort. What family gaming should be aboout. This should see plenty of tabletime with the kids. Almost makes me feel the same level of excitement as an adult that I used to as a kid for games like Treasure Of The Pharaohs, and Ghost Train. It's also a game that can be played single player just to see if you can beat your own score.

A very simple push your luck game, with a little memory aspect added in. It's a decent and pleasant little game, that probably has 5 or so plays in it in total.

It's gloriously overproduced which then unfortunately makes it far too expensive for what it is. This should be meeples and 2D. It'd lose some charm but could then also sell for half the price it does; at which point it'd be worth picking up.

RATING: 3
Not a terribly large amount of decision making here, and the game in the end comes down to a bunch of luck, but it is a pretty game and it works well with younger people.  Very easy to explain, and oozing with theme, but the replay will not hold up with this one.

RATING: 7
A fun push your luck game.  I would probably play this one more with kids than adults myself.  This game is pretty unforgiving if you lose your first character as many of the treasures are picked up in the latter part of the dungeon and the walls or boulder will keep you from the area with the most treasures about mid game.

Bought for my sons 10th birthday present ..

With it's mix of luck & simple choices/strategy this game balances out well enough that playing with both my son(10/Aspergers) and daughter(19), it really is any-ones game to win .. I especially like that each round can turn out quite different from the last - in some we're all dead within minutes of starting, and in others we're all out before needing our second character to even enter .. However it can drag-on a bit if one player has died and others are still inside, or some inside while others have exited ..

I'm happy I bought this though, and another thing worth mentioning is with just a bit of imagination (house rules), the theme, components, and general game-play lends itself perfectly to co-op play .. A huge bonus in our house!

Bombed when I tried to introduce it to my current group, and for reasons I cannot fathom as it feels like exactly the kind of game they'd like lighthearted and fun - but for some reason the mechanics were completely lost on them across the board.

Exciting push-your-luck adventue game enjoyed by all my family (incl. 5 yr old daughter). Younger kids may find the load level concept tricky, but get on fine with guidance. Quick to play, once set up (lots of cards to set out). A bit like I feel Dungeonquest ought to be, but with an Indiana Jones theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Pros: Nice minis and components.
Variety of play.
Good laughs.

Cons: Not much dungeon variability.
Silly movement.
Replayability suffers.

Conclusion: I was hoping to like The Adventurers, but in the end it fell as flat as the fourth Indiana Jones movie.  A lot of time was spent on the different characters and I can see how they can change it up.  But really the board is somewhat static.  Go here then here then here etc.  So what was originally a good idea progressed into meh-land.  Let's hope for some good expansions.

RATING: 4
A neat little idea with nice components, cool theme and interesting artwork. On the downside, the luck components is pretty high, the player abilities are very imbalanced and tucked into layers of other mechanics is a real-time memorization component, which really detracts from the overall feel of the game for me. I think this might work well for kids, and adults may be taken by the novelty at first, but this won't have any staying power.

The biggest accomplishment of The Temple of Chac was not in the creation of this game, but rather a durable franchise.  This is basically a Tomb Raider universe built for multiple heros.  The game itself is very nearly a children's title only.  It's a series of treacherous and rulesy minigames in a race for the end.

RATING: 7.5
Indiana Jones in boardgame form, gorgeous trap components, and great fun as long as you don't play it too seriously. Expect to curse Kali when bad luck comes your way, but boy does it evoke those thrilling movie moments. Another temple board would have made this game really worth its price. Right now it "feels" a bit shallow for what you get, but if you're an Indy fan looking for a press-your-luck fix, you can probably justify it.

I can't say that this is the best game I have ever played, or, for that matter, even close to being so.  However, for what it is (a game that can be wrecked by flips of cards and rolls of dice) and for how long it takes (45 minutes), it is tremendously fun.  There is a small amount of strategy and choices, but, in the end, its more about trying to race your way out of the cave with a huge boulder bearing down on you.  I'd hazard to say that it is almost as much fun getting your adventurers squished than it is actually winning the game (through two games, I am 0-4).

In the second game we played, Caron got out of the cave with no treasure--and won.  Consistently high rolls do two things--make boulders hit breakneck speeds, and give you lots of actions.  The problem with lots of actions is that players have a tendency to get greedy--just like in real life.  

A wonderfully fun romp, one that will appeal to a wide range of players, maybe even bringing some non-gamers to the table.  Good stuff, and can make for some great stories after the game has been put away.  For that alone, it's worth the price of admission.

UPDATE:

After two more plays, I think I can kind of sort of put The Adventurers in the gateway category.  It has very slightly limited replay value, and I emphasize  very slightly.  Most of the games I have played follow a similar pattern.  However, it is really easy to understand, easy to explain, and has a fast, fluid feel to it that immediately draws people in.  More traditional boardgamers might find a little bit of sameness to it, but its a fair trade off for a fun, atmospheric game that is as charming as this.

I love games that have narrative.  I am a huge fan of Ameritrash games for that reason.  This game has a narrative.  Yes, the story is short and simple, but fun to play through.

This is not a game to play every day as the game MAY have some dominate strategies. The designer said that every element has been matched out as far as odds go so the dominate strategy may be BGG groupthink). Still, the people I play with don't use the bridge and rarely go for the 6 point treasure (we actually make it 9). It is fun to bring out every once in a while, especially for people who haven't played it.

I don't think this is fun when played too often, hence the lower rating. If I were to rate this based on the fun I have when I do play it would be more like an 8. 

I rate Horus a bit higher (see comments) but I truly do enjoy having both games in my collection.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 3.5

This is the better of the two Adventurers games. It feels very much like playing the the Temple of Doom movie. I had a blast on my first play, but the game lacks sufficient variety for replayability. I find myself wanting to play this primarily with people who are new to it because that's when it's most fun (the walls crushing in, the ball chasing you, etc., are far more exciting the first time around). This is not a game I would buy (unless I just had excess money and storage space) but would recommend for any library collection for game stores, game cafes or conventions.

This is a fun thematic press-your-luck adventure game. The table presence is awesome albeit a little wobbly at times (especially the walls during the first phase).  Sadly we play it so infrequently that I often need to do a full rules consult prior to each game which turns setup time into ~10 minutes rather than 2-3 but once we get going we have a lot of fun with this (even if I almost always die  :) )

An OK game, that can be a good deal of fun if players try to be as greed as possible. But I guess it can be way less fun if the players are careful and put much thought behind every move.

Anyway, I can't also say if the game has a lot of replay value - it do have things that can change from game to game, but the whole experience could be somewhat the same. But I haven't played enough to really judge this - so it is just an overall gamer's feeling.

The production value, however, is through the roof. Great bits, and everytime the game is in a table, there are people wanting to see what is going on. It will surely attract the children for a game.

The temple starts with a room of crushing walls, leading into a winding passage that takes you past a lava pit and locked alcoves. The passage goes on, with two short-cuts that might save you time; a fast river or a rickety wooden bridge. You must balance attempts to grab treasure from the rooms, as you pass through, with staying ahead of a massive boulder, tumbling down the passage after you. If you have to let the boulder pass or be crushed to death, then you're forced to jump in the river and risk drowning just to get ahead. Otherwise, the boulder reaches the exit before you, blocking it and you're trapped forever.

RATING: 7
A very light dice-roller, basically a fun simulation of Indiana-Jones-style temple robbers. Players move through a Mayan temple, risking constant death while trying to get to the exit, carrying as much treasure as they dare. The more treasure cards you have, the fewer actions you might get this round. If your character gets killed, a second one can drop in and you may still get enough treasure and escape to win.

A mix of very basic lucky dice-rolling, lucky card draw for the treasure, and some decision-making about possible risks. Beautifully produced, with 12 small but detailed plastics miniatures, and an exotic and deadly temple. Adults may tire from repeats of The Adventurers, but kids will get lots of thrills.

RATING: 6
Great looking game with a lot of atmosphere, which unfortunately is a bit lacking in the game department. Halfway through the game, the constant dice throwing makes the game feel repetitive and playing time is so short, that the required setup time feels long in comparison. I started my first game thinking that it would be hard just to survive, but the game is really only suspenseful when players are determined to gather as many treasure cards as possible. If players are determined to do just that, the game becomes much more interesting.
UPDATE: Played with three players, and liked the game much better than with two. There is a higher chance that one of the characters gets in a dangerous situation, and that's what makes the game fun. The game is probably even better with four or five players. Raised my rating to a 7.
UPDATE: Playing with six was not a good experience. Both the downtime and the playing time were too long for the game to remain enjoyable. Also, treasure piles depleted too fast. Final score: 6.

The Adventurers has proved to be quite fun and filled with tension.  The designers did a great job balancing the desired to acquire treasure with the urgency of getting out of the temple.

Painted the minis before knowing of the ready painted ones...

Oh, well. What's a week of painting to get minis that look worse that the ready painted. Saved some money, at least. :)

Excellent game. A small worry on the longetivity. Will I still be playing after 20 goes?

Quick, takes less than an hour and no reading required, so foreign kids kan play too.

A big thumbs up by adults and kids alike.

This game is a blast to play with my family!  It's light, but the Indiana Jones flavor oozes right out of this one!  Love IT!!!

After watching Raiders of the Lost Ark for the millionth time I decided to get this game.  I know it might not be as deep as other gamers' games, but I can't think of another game that captures this theme so well and I really like being an Indy (like) character and my wife can be like a Laura Croft.

Great game, especially when you want to play something more interesting than a simple game, but you don't really want to have to think that much harder! I recommend the variation cards listed in BGG files to keep the game interesting for more replayability.

lots of fun if you play with kids, family, or folks that don't take it too seriously. the boulder is great.  I wish the minis were painted.  I need to make that happen.  I've got 2 boys (5 and 2) so I think this will stick around in my collection for many years.  

update: minis painted.  awesome!

RATING: 6
Simply good cheesy fun. The Indiana Jones/King Solomons Mines vibe is well implemented throughout,and the game looks good on the table.
 High push-your-luck element will not suit all tastes,but if your play group can embrace its frantic,scrambling,sweaty money-grubbing romp,there is plenty to like.
 Only downside really is possible limited replayability due to none modular board,although i think the existing board is easily altered/house ruled(with many options and variants already existing on boardgamegeek).

I tend to go for either a Euro-style game or an all-out Ameritrash game, choosing strategy or experience.  I'm usually looking for one or the other, and when I want one of the other of them, what I want is one or the other of them.  The Adventurers tries to be a little of both, and ultimately dilutes the impact of what either game can be.  It's not a bad game, it just tries too hard to satisfy both crowds, when it really should just be for one or the other.  That being said, though, there are some neat mechanisms in the game (most notably the choosing of two cards for use over the course of the game), and the production is incredible.

The Adventurers features a fast-paced thrilling run through the Temple of Chac, the Mayan rain god. As your intrepid adventurers delve through the ruins, they will face deadly traps guarding the ancient relics they prize.
\13\ \13\
The Adventurers plays out like an Indiana Jones movie in plastic and cardboard. After entering a temple in search of treasures, each player must bring his character safely through the collapsing walls, across the lava field, and past the rushing waterfall - all while trying to avoid an onrushing boulder. If your adventurers meets an untimely fate, you can bring her back-up onto the board and try to pick up where she left off.
\13\ \13\
You can be as greedy as you want to be in the temple - stopping at alcoves to try to spot treasure or taking time in the lava room to pick up precious items - but the more goods you have, the harder it is for you to move. Each turn you must first check your load level based on the number of items you’re carrying. A player then rolls five dice, and for each die that’s equal to or higher than your load level, you can take one action on that turn. Take too much, and you might be able to do nothing more than sitting and counting your gems.

Didn't think I was going to like this one, but was pleasantly surprised! Components are great and really add to the tension, fosters a lot of fun table talk, and plays really quickly. I don't like the variable value at endgame treasures, as I've seen it come down to one die roll at the end and that sort of thing puts me off, but otherwise a lot of fun in a short play time.

This game really made me happy. Even the wife liked it! The components are fantastic!  The quality of everything from the plastic figures (which are GREAT) to the cards and board are superb!  I am really happy I bought this game- I was unsure at first, but after a quick read of the rules I realized this was just what I liked- a quick and easy game with just enough choices to make it fun but not too many to make it a task. After a few plays I am sold! 
Gorgeous artwork to boot! 
Oh, and an expansion or three would be oh-so-welcome!

The theme is really nice, but the gameplay seems a bit of a mish-mash. The board is split into several sections and each one feels a bit too much like a different game entirely. 

On the plus side, the artwork is really nice and the miniatures are of quite a high standard.

RATING: 8.5
This is a great Indy themed romp.  It's all about luck and how far you want to push it.  Think Dungeonquest that plays in far less time with simpler rules or Incan Gold with more depth and a game board.  A fun game suitable for a repeat or as a quick filler.  If you're looking for strategy, look elsewhere.

Its a silly game, and I won't claim its highly strategic.  That said, its a good game, with a fun theme and some great "story telling" as the tomb raiders make their run/swim for the exit.  Only to die horribly...

Rating after one play. Kinda fun, but I don't see a high replayability value in it. The puzzles will become too simple, the luck element is fairly high, and it all just becomes one of those games you just have to be in the mood for. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Lots of fun, and a good "press your luck" mechanic that goes into more detail than Incan Gold.

Still, I wish there were a few more options for getting through some of the sections.  The moving wall room is quite easy to get through and then serves no more purpose.  The lava room is almost always a good choice even if you haven't looked at the glyphs, since you can get a ton of treasure and avoid the boulder.

A nice, light game that is fine for what it is (but perhaps could have been a little more).

RATING: 6
Played this for the first time today (I think it came out on Tuesday). It was a fun little game, but I don't think I would ever buy it: there's just not enough long-term strategy or ways to affect the other players for me. Light enough, though, that it might be a nice filler game.

Wanted to like it more but I just don't feel it plays as fun as it sounds. The components are gorgeous but is it enough? It is fun but not very. Played it with a 13 year old who seemed to think the same. Will try it some more and see if the games improve.

Can you make it out alive?  Can you find the most hidden treasure?  The Adventurers is a fun, press your luck game that makes you want to keep coming back for more.  You feel like Indiana Jones racing the boulder to wealth and victory.  Do I look at just more one clue before this walls come crashing into me, do I risk stepping on that suspicious square and hope not to get burned alive, or will just one more dice roll unlock that awesome treasure? Discover the fun with The Adventurers.

frenetic, press your luck fun, with awesome thematic elements.  will be a big hit in the right group.  will not be a big hit with the heavy thinker eurosnobs.  for god's sake, get the painted minis.  they are awesome, and increase not only the fun of the game, but make it speedier.  one small concern is over the replayability, due to the possible memorization of the trap tiles over a sequence of plays.

I actually prefer the Pyramid of Horus due to it's "open room" style game board, as opposed to the track in this game, but it's one of those games just "works" with new people; and it's weird just how this game STILL sort of stands out as a unique thing. Plus...that big boulder piece? How can you resist that?

I can't deny that it was a riot watching other people dying to traps and the big boulder.  However, the rest of the game felt very by the numbers and repetitive.  At least there is a definitive end for The Adventurers, unlike other dungeon crawling/exploring titles that can drag on and on until all the fun has been sucked out.  Highly recommended for families that are especially into Indiana Jones and similar stories.  As for me, I think I've seen all there is to offer and feels no need to ever request another play.

When i heard the idea of the game for the first time i was quite excited.When i saw the board of the game my thouths hadnt changed.But from the moment we started playing the game (6 persons) i was bored.There werent many strategical decisions    and the winner of the game was just the luckiest player.Moreover,the special abilities of all characters werent really important, neither the second character was even usefull.Finally,coming to a conclusion, i think  that the general idea of the game was quite good but there were many small mistakes which finally changed the grade of the game from 7 to 4.

This is a great game full of thematic elements very similar to the Indiana Jones series!  

The game play is quick which fits perfectly with the theme.  The characters are very interesting and compliment the temple-diving experience very nicely.  I especially like the varied Character special abilities.

The components are top-notch featuring very alluring artwork and miniatures.  Although the pre-painted minis were not included in the box, I still think this game is well worth the price.  The board is especially nice and contains some pretty interesting traps.

I look forward to seeing more expansions, especially those which contain new boards for more variety, different traps, more charaters with varied abilities and maybe even a scenario booklet forcing players to complete certain tasks during their time inside the Temple of Chac.

The Adventurers speaks to twelve year old me who LOVES this game. It looks fantastic and is a bucket load of fun. 

The game is actually more enjoyable the more times you die. Pressing your luck over the lava pit is tense and more exciting than playing a cautious game of 'keep away from the traps and get just enough treasure to beat the others'. 

Don't play to win, play to live out the dream of being Indiana Jones.

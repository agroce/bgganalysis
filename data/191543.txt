RATING: 5
Simpler version than Ricochet Robots, which I like. Very uneven competition unless players are of equal skills. The problem is that some of the solutions are too simple. Luckily, there is a variant that involves an intermediate point to visit.

More of an exercise than a game.

Biggest complaint: Why didn't they put numbers on the squares so we can use the robot? Ugh. I could just write them on.

I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Micro Robots is hardly a game. It's more of a brain-teaser-like activity and it's not even very good at that. In fact it gets really repetitive, really fast. It's quick enough to be used as a filler, I guess, but then again I wonder whether it's worth to play something just for the sake of it. I would much rather have a conversation with the people at the table than play something so shallow like this.

Extremely flimsy. Micro Robot is a very quick filler, but in my opinion it's really not worth your attention.

Uma reinvenção do jogo original, Ricochet Robots. Não tem a profundidade do original, porém é mais tranquilo para jogar é fácil de ser apresentado para crianças de um modo geral. Gostei, mas verá pouca mesa.

Worthless reimplement of Ricochet Robots. If you didn't like the original you won't like this one. If you have the original stick with it and don't look this way... The only better thing is that it's more portable than the original so you can count that as a positive, otherwise I don't think I'll ever play it again.

RATING: 7
Based on 1 play with 4 players:

This makes a really nice companion to Ricochet Robots. It gives much of the same brain-crunchy feel in a quicker, smaller package. I actually find the way movement works to be harder to process, but I'm sure for many people it will be the opposite.

The emphasis on speed is a bit of a double-edged sword for me. Being a slow counter/processor, it makes it harder for me to get points in this game - but it's also what makes the game feel different enough from its big brother to be interesting. I enjoy Ricochet Robots more if I've got the time and space, but I like this one enough that I could see myself picking it up to have just to tote around.

My wife and I love Ricochet Robots, even though we don't play it that often these days. So naturally we had to get Micro Robots as it sounds right up our alley!

And even though it's a clever little game, we just cannot get too excited about it. We feel it's just too quick and simple. in Ricochet Robots, you are sitting and calculating lots of moves ahead and keep trying to place the robots in your head, which can be difficult, but in Micro Robots that tension isn't really there. The advanced version where you have to get to point A before B is a little better, and while I would play it, it's not something I'm dying to play again.

Changes from Ricochet Robots:
- One robot.
- Much smaller board.
- Dice determine target space instead of cardboard chits.
- Purely a speed game.  The first person to find a legal path wins.

Not as good as the original, but tends to be accessible to a wider range of players.  Very small box makes it easy to bring along.

Micro Robots, a simultaneous play game inspired by Alex Randolph's classic Ricochet Robots, challenges players to quickly determine how a robot can move from one spot on the grid to another.

A smaller, faster, simpler version of Ricochet Robots. I suppose it accomplishes what it set out to do but even more than with its bigger brother, you need players of roughly equal skill level for this to make any sense at all.

If you like Ricochet Robots it's a fairly safe bet you'll like this, too, as long as you don't mind that the puzzles are quite a bit easier. Being faster than the other players still isn't, of course.

Great little puzzle.
When the shortest route is easily spotted, I try to find the longest (stepping on each space once, at most).

Updated my rating from 9 to 10:
I would often ran into a series of unlucky dice rolls where the next target space was too easy to reach.
Using https://capitalfun.net/ubots/ as an add-on to the physical board (see https://boardgamegeek.com/article/26030305), I can now see myself solving one of these puzzles every day, thus justifying my current rating.

A simplified Ricochet Robots in a tiny box.
Kind of strange how in this game, when you think you see a solution, you just say the number and show it--there is no waiting to see if someone can come up with a better solution. Guess it makes sense (simplified board limits how many possible ways there are to solve anyway), but is a bit strange as either way [right or wrong solution], the destination changes.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (May 2016)

I really like Ricochet Robots, so I was keen on trying Micro Robots, the new game based on it. The game´s essence remains the same, but Micro Robots is meaner and quicker.

The rules are uber easy to explain, you can do it under 1 minute, but the game isn’t easy (at least for me). Playtime is around the 15 minute mark (although I have had games that lasted 5 minutes).

The game components are top notch and the game box is very small and portable. 

The transparent robot is superfluous as you don’t really need it BUT I’m very happy that the transparent robot can be used in the regular edition of Ricochet Robots. I always like when publishers do this. I guess it makes that game a lot easier having another robot available to move. I need to play it to verify it.

Micro Robots is harder on the players because there is no additional time for the players to think. When a player yells a number, the round is over one way or another. It is a lot meaner as well for the same reason, the fastest players will trash the slowest players among us, every time. In most of my games I have finished with 1 or 0 points, but I really like the game nonetheless. I just need to get better at it :D. (This kind of game always taxes me heavily, I just struggle with spatial puzzles).

Bottom line, Micro Robots is a good game. I will keep it in my game collection along with its big brother. Both games feel different enough for me so there is no conflict there. If you like Ricochet Robots, chances are high you will also like Micro Robots. For me, both games are at the same level.

The sand timer did a lot to make Ricochet Robots appealing for large groups, and I miss it, although I haven't tried throwing an extra sand timer in the box to play with the Ricochet Robot rules. 2p Micro Robots works for me as-is using the "two target spaces" variant.

Do you like Ricochet Robots? If you do you might like this. Compact and simple. No rule about waiting for #sec to find a faster route. If you find the route you call it and take a token. I like the challenge of trying to find the shorter path in the big game so that was a bit of a bummer. It was cute and I would play it if anyone had it out again. No need for the bot, however. Enjoyable enough.

Ricochet Robots is one of my favorite games of all time, and I my heart sung at the idea of a pocket version.   Unfortunately, Micro doesn't manage to keep the spark of it's parentage.
The core puzzle of Micro is very simple, and requires very little effort to solve.  There's no sense of thoughtfulness here.
The REAL benefit of picking this up is the ability to use the included robot as a sixth piece in Ricochet!  The designer has released a litany of potential house rules for it, such as only being able to move it diagonally, or the ability to move through walls.

Talvez por aversão à mudança, ou por gostar tanto do original, não havia gostado grande coisa deste jogo, aquando da primeira vez que o experimentara, em Essen; contudo, quando o expliquei ao serviço da Devir, já em Portugal, mudei a opinião de imediato, dada a fluidez que este Micro Robots apresenta, bem como a rejogabilidade proporcionada pelo tabuleiro modular de dupla face. É um jogo rápido e fenomenalmente adaptado de "Ricochet Robots", com o topping de o robot poder ser acrescentado ao jogo base, para maior variedade...

RATING: 5
Cute idea but I found the colors too frustratingly similar, at least when played in sub-optimal lighting! This hurts my rating of it.

Also the clear robot blocks the view of what's underneath too much, so we decided to use the clear "target" disk as the robot; a pity.

At least it's in a nice smallish box.

And having to bid the exact distance you show is a neat way to speed up gameplay instead of having the bidding as in Ricochet Robots.

French review of Micro Robots on Vin d'jeu: http://www.vindjeu.eu/2016/05/04/micro-robots/
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
[thing=191543][/thing] has the same idea than that of [thing=51][/thing]: taking the robot from one place to the other. The positive differences are: the shorter playing time, as the solutions are easier to see, there are no barriers or different robots, and the game game ends when someone reaches 5 points; it is also much more portable, as the box is small. Yet, overall, this version is worst than the original: in here, only the first solution proposed is accepted - if the person isn't able to solve in the amount of moves called, she loses a point to the player with least points. I consider this awful. I don't like a mechanism that gives free points to people that didn't earn them, but without a "line" of solutions, as there is in [thing=51][/thing], a better solution would be playing a new round without the person that made the mistake, as it would work just as losing a point, but the other players would still need to earn the point.

Yet, in the end, [thing=191543][/thing] delivers what it promises, but it also a miniature version of the quality of the original (which I also don't particularly like, due to being constantly furstrated by it; but I admire the elegance and intelligence of it). The main positive is the reduced playing time; the worst is how points are given when someone makes a mistake. As the game is, I would try (without too much effort, though) to avoid; but with a difference take on the points, chances are I would prefer this over its big brother.

It comes in a small box and has a smaller footprint than Ricochet Robots. The system is actually a bit different and a bit easier, but still scratches the same itch as its progenitor.  I think it's great, and makes for a great gift actually. There is also an added difficulty level to explore, which is what pushed me over the edge to buy this.

RATING: 10
Different enough from Ricochet Robots to be worth having both, but similar enough that if you like it's big brother you know you'll like this too.

With the basic rules it's too easy and fast though, so here's a simple variant: place two (or more) targets and play it Ricochet Robots style "who can do it in least steps" but the order of stepping on the targets doesn't matter.

The fact that you can integrate this into Ricochet Robots as an expansion/promo just makes it a must buy for any RR fan.

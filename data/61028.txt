I am filled with anxiety each time I think about starting a new game because I know how difficult it is going to be.

This game is brutal (in a good way).  It relentlessly chews you up and spits you out.  Any victory you gain is won through terrible odds, hard work, blood, sweat, and tears.

A well-made game.

Only played the solo game. This is very hard to win and seems to be impossible when you don't get at least a few lucky rolls. I'm not going to state the game is too luck dependant just yet, but it sure seems that way after the first few plays. Design is original and fresh and has some original mechanics in it. I'm looking forward to try the multiplayer game as the coop factor could solve some of the luck issues. Overall a fun little dice game.

I’m as enthustiastic about historical games as I am about historical novels, which means none at all: D-Day Dice stands for an exception to this rule of thumb though, as it’s a first-rate cooperative game with deep interaction among players and - what’s even more relevant - many dice to roll.

The basic RWB rulesystem is so easy and straightforward to play that the game doesn’t need anything else to get fun quickly: I can’t help but think it would make an even better science fiction themed game though. (September 2013)

[b]Update[/b] - In November 2013 I’ve played the [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/101785/d-day-dice]Retail Version[/url] at long last and, as presumable, I’ve enjoyed it way better than this free trial version: yet, since it’s still a great source of fun, my rating hasn’t changed since my previous comment.

I'm not a big fan of simple dice games, but if I have to play one, I'd pick this one almost every time.  The fact that it's a wargame doesn't hurt!

It's very tough to win -- I think the key is to score triples that add bonus soldiers whenever possible.

Played it (Utah) for the first time today (Sept 18, 2010) - had 52 soldiers at one time and still lost!

Players have to lead squads ashore on the Normandy invasion beaches, and take out a pillbox.  Die rolling game for 1-4 players.  Players play simultaneously, rolling six dice (2 each of red, white and blue).  You are granted two re-rolls, but must "lock" two dice after the first roll.  Results are tallied and recorded.  You bank courage, tools and men.  Stars are checked off to recruit a specialist to grant you a power.  Tools can be spent on equipment you find on the beach.  Courage is spent to advance up the beach.  Men are a necessary resource, but are eroded from your squad at the end of your turn, based on your position - some locations are more dangerous than others.  Excellent die roller that makes you think and plan your way ashore, but keeps the pressure on you to keep moving forwards.  You win if you enter the pillbox, and lose if you are out of men, or unable to advance when forced to.  Excellent maps and resources... deserves a publisher.  Great stuff.

RATING: 3
This resembles playing Yahtzee and has nothing to do with a wargame! The rules are easy to comprehend and play is fast paced. Struggling every round to accumulate troops and bonuses relative to your dice rolls so that you can advance sectors and reach the final one where you find a bunker. No matter which map you choose to play the mechanics are identical and actions are repeated. The bookkeeping is a brain teaser every round and after a couple of plays the whole game becomes bland. Once you have found how things work out, it is easy to beat the game and reach your goal. I fail to see where is the fun and intriguing part in this game.

Free game, so will be quite generous with the rating. All in all, it's fun trying to break down the puzzle and kudos to the designer for giving a solitaire game a multi-player option/dynamic. Theme also makes sense here, i.e., does not feel pasted on.

Unfortunately, I think To Court The King does a better job in combining strategy and dice. D-Day Dice is still very random and best of strategies can still be undone, leaving the player with nothing but to start over again (and the repetition gets annoying after a while).

Mar 2010 - Print and Play.  Very quick to learn and print.  All you really need is a printer for the scenario sheets and 6 dice.  Colour printer not required.  Fun little diversion, like a war themed Yahtzee.  Bonus points for multiple scenarios (2 to date, with another couple planned), quickness to play and set up.  It really feels like you are making choices during the game.  7/10

RATING: 4
A cleverly-constructed but mechanical solitaire dice game. I found it to be too encumbered with processing and bookkeeping. Those who enjoy Roll Through the Ages may disagree, since this is a very similar style of game. I might have played it more if I had been defeated, but I lost interest after beating each of the maps rather handily on the first try.

[Update: I did play each of the maps again, beating them with with 71 and 60 soldiers remaining. Despite what others are saying, the game is just too easy if you're able to see the best tricks. Abuse the Lieutenant and the Captain and the Scout. Use the Shoulder Patch to get one or both of the Lieutenant/Captain. Don't keep tool dice unless you're going to amass lots of them in one turn. Advance as slowly as possible.]

RATING: 4
This game is more complex and involved than Delve the dice game. You might think that this is a good thing, but personally, I think there is too much to think about and too much bookkeeping for me to bother. It’s nice, but I prefer Roll through the ages in almost all cases.

Tendency: I expect it to stay as it is.

Brutal, brutal, really tough as hell, but has the elusive "let me try again!" quality. Be sure to look a couple spaces up the beach when planning your advance, otherwise you will arrive at your destination without the gear and the specialists you need to survive. Played a half-dozen times and haven't come close to winning yet.

Nice little dice game. I've played solo once and I found it had interesting decisions although luck does seem to play a big part also... Managed to win on my first play with 37 points and 2 soldiers and 1 specialist left. Was pretty lucky at the end because I got 20 item points with a roll of three 1s which I also converted to soldiers. The 20 points were spent in the flamethrower which weakened the bunker's defense allowing me to win...

There's some interesting stuff going on here - I like the way the designer has actually made something interesting out of the basic "Yahtzee" mechanic especially. But it is *ridiculously* hard, unless I've misunderstood the rules. I also found it disappointingly mechanical, especially in view of the fact that it obviously tries hard to convey a theme. Still, definately worth some of your valuable time to check out, especially as a solo game.

[microbadge=13314]

01/12/2013: I thought about picking up the full production of this game, so I figured I would try out the free version first.  When we (Daughter K and I), first played this, I thought it was really fun.  You roll dice and through a Yahtzee-style mechanism, you build up your army with soldiers, weapons, and courage.  Your army charges ahead, fighting its way to the final bunker where they must survive with at least one soldier to gain victory.

We had a lot of fun those first few games.  However, after a few plays, the strategy of the game started getting stale and as we played a few more times and on a different map or two, my interest is fading fast.  I think the full production with all the chrome and a bevy of additional maps would certainly add to the enjoyment and difficulty, but I feel the end result would be the same.  Eventually, you'll find one strategy that will give you the best chances of defeating that map...and I wonder how different those strategies would be between the different locations.

Overall, it's a fun game and one of the few Yahtzee "variants" that I've tried out.  It's longevity and replayability are what's in question for me.

In this WW II themed dice rolling game, players use their soldiers to try to advance during the D-day invasions. Each player has two red, two blue and two white dice. You are allowed 2 re-rolls and can "freeze" previous rolls to give you the best rolls. For instance, rolling a 4 of each color will give you a bonus. The dice give you more soldiers, equipment, and courage to advance, while the sectors contain machineguns, bunkers and so forth.

It's an okay solitaire game, but not fun when playing with other people. I have played the Gold beach scenario with 2 other people. I'm willing to give this game another go, I think it has some potential, but it fell a bit flat with the other players. 

I understand it is being republished as a cooperative game, with some rules updates, so I think that is a nice improvement. Looking forward to trying the new release!

This provides some dice rolling fun, with an awesome theme to die for. The game is all about rolling dice to collect stuff and buy tech tree improvements. By stuff we mean you're standing on the invasion beach gathering more and more soldiers under your command, your mission to get to the bunker at the top of the beach. To move up the beach, you need to roll "courage" points. Every move you need to gather more soldiers to replace the ones mowed down (similar to the food requirement in Roll Through The Ages). You can buy long term specialists (tech improvements) to help out (the usual dice manipulation, loss diminishment, etc), or one-use-only items to diminish the pain as you get further up the map into the really nasty bits. I love the way the game imbues a continual sense of overwhelming loss and the desperate need to drive further up the beach regardless. Expect to be massacred when you first play - careful study of the improvements and thought as to viable combinations is required to do well. That and get lucky with your 2 re-rolls. I really liked the ideas behind the bonuses available for triples across the different coloured dice (you have 2 dice in each of 3 colours) which gives you something to actively shoot for every turn and expands the range of choice. I think there are still some flaky bits (v1.4 played) around the VP scoring, and the expected win/loss ratio maybe could be higher, but it's very playable as is and shouldn't diminish the enjoyment and exploration of the game while/if it fine-tunes, especially with different maps available to provide variety.

Outstanding little dice game - and this coming from someone who's not all that enamoured with dice games. There's real potential here to build on the base rule system and expand the game with new maps, tools, specialists and unit types. Future maps could see solitaire scenarios, co-operative games and direct conflict against other players. If this system is developed well it'll be a winner and a publisher like Z-Man would do well to pick it up then milk future expansions out of it.

In any case, as is it's way better than Roll Through the Ages - there's a sense of urgency and pressure as you're trying to reach the objective.

I'd dispense with the convoluted points system and turn it into a simple objective race, or simple beating the other side, or securing the objective with the most troops remaining - depending upon the scenario you're playing. Keep it simple - the fun is in the playing.

I would also definitely not limit it with such a specific name. The scenario possibilities are endless and should be built around a base game with a more generic name.

RATING: 7
Solid, meaty solitaire dice game. You can play multiplayer but it's essentially solitaire.

Each turn you roll 6 dice (with two re-rolls) in order to generate soldiers, courage, equipment points etc in order to progress through a map. Each section of the map has brutal requirements in order to progress. You can stay on each section three turns, losing soldiers marked on the section each turn.

The requirements get harder the further you advance up. Scenarios are based on famous beach landings in WWII. 

It's a hard slog and you'll die more than you will suceed. A clever package with quite alot of options. A clever twist is the bonus awarded by rolling triples on each of the red, white, blue colour dice. A staights gives you a Medal of Honour bonus.

Glad it got picked up by a publisher. Yahtzee with objectives and some clever additions.

Great solo dice game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Extremely difficult solo dice game -- team play is possible, but apart from the trading phase is the very definition of multiplayer solitaire -- in the Yahtzee roll/re-roll mode. You roll six dice in three colours, hoping to acquire more soldiers, items (provide one-off bonuses), stars (recruit specialist soldiers for persistent bonuses) and courage (required to advance). The key to winning is the "RWBs", bonuses for getting the same symbol/number in three different colours.

It's not a brainless exercise; There are decisions to be made, particularly around which dice to re-roll to maximize the chances of a useful RWB. My only problem with the game is that the cost of poor rolls is very, very high, and unlike most wargames, where it's comparatively rare to make a single roll that will decide victory or defeat, almost every roll in D-Day Dice is a decider.

Core to the game is rolling enough new soldiers every turn to balance your losses, but to win the game it is necessary to build up a substantial surplus -- and trying to build a surplus is not easy when a roll providing twelve new soldiers is [i]superb[/i], but even early in the game you lose 5-10 per turn.

The idea is, of course, to acquire items and specialists to mitigate the damage (one item lets you ignore damage for a turn, for example), but you have to be lucky, and you have to be lucky often. For me, I think the game might hit a sour spot with its balance of luck vs complexity/involvement. I feel like I have to make good decisions even to have a chance -- but the outcome is just that, a chance. Winning or losing is down less to me than to the dice.

Clever little press-your-luck game with more strategy and tactics than Yatzee.  Looking forward to more expansions.  Dangerously addictive.

Nice to see a set of "trial" rules that are fun and don't feel intentionally crippled during play.

yes, I like it, I'm sure. 

I like this kind of PnP games where you can play without real assemble work: it's really print-and-play!

But it's damn hard to win this game! I guess I'll have to try some different tactics...

This is what hooked me on the game and promted me to back the Kickstarter for the amazing retail version.

For a solitaire print-and-play dice game, this is impressive.  I'll never bother playing this with more players.  There's a lot of care here to make the game good, with decisions and resource management aplenty.  It's basically about sitting in the lesser defended areas and gathering enough resources to get through the worst areas quickly.  I do wish the maps were more thematic.  As it is, they are rather dry as they are simply boxes, with symbols to move from place to place.  But that's idle whining, considering that this is a free game.

The start of the game seems a little boring, as it's all about rolling the dice, marking what you've collected, buying what makes sense, and then doing it over again, until you're forced to move out of your location.  Once you do that, though, the games takes on a nice tension as the players navigate the battlefield and use their resources to overtake the bunker.  Plus, the battle boards are different between the maps, which means that what you're trying to accumulate on those early turns is determined by what demands the map places on you.  Regardless, the sectors get more and more difficult as the players progress, and even staying in one place and trying to roll the resources you need are difficult, as you're going to lose soldiers to enemy fire each time you're in that sector.  Depending strictly on the dice to give you the soldiers you need to keep your ground is a bad move, so knowing which specialists and items to use will be critical to success, because if one player loses, then everyone loses.  The different resources you can use based on the dice is interesting and thematic, and the different scenarios are where this game really shines.  This is a good teaser of what's to come, and a perfect introduction to this game system.  Like any cooperative game, it has the potential to succumb to the Meathead Effect, but I think that's unavoidable for these sorts of games.

Fun and simple... but TOUGH AS HELL!
And rather repetitive. Just don't play too many sessions in a row.

Fun dice game - will have to give it a few more plays. I actually did rather well in my first game from what I have read but fell short of the final bunker... killed to a man on its doorstep so to speak.

One of my favorite games. I have paid for games that were not as good as this!

This is a decent dice game, especially for solitaire play. I laminated all the scenario and score sheets. I don't find that it has much replay value, and even different missions tend to feel similar.

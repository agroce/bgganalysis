Honshu reminds me of The Hanging Gardens for the card laying part. This is a nice puzzle mechanic when you are trying to fit the card in the optimal way into your layout. Of course there are differences between the games  in form of some additional mechanics and a completely different scoring system. 

Not sure about the bidding mechanic since it rarely makes any sense to bid low. This is because midway of a round you are giving your bidding cards to another player and you really do not want to give your best cards away. Moreover, I found it quite hard to assess who is leading because the information is scattered across a large area and  hidden into small symbols. The theme is exceptionally far detached from the mechanics and art, but this is just a little thing because admittedly it is quite rare to see a game where the mechanics represent the theme. The art could be improved though. At least I did not feel even the remotest of connections with Japan if not for the small sakura icons depicting victory points.

Anyways, a nice design and we actually played a number of games in succession. I think it speaks for the game if people are willing to play it again (meaning that the contents-to-length ratio is good and the game does not induce negative feelings).

Enjoyed the game.  But not for AP players.  There are way too many variable to justify taking too long to choose which card to play.  Needs to be played quick and lightly.

Interesting mechanism about deciding the first player each turn. It is quite dry, doesn't give you any idea of your points standing with reports to the other players during the game (which is not a disadvantage necessarily) and can provoke some serious AP (if you are prone) especially in a 2-p game (that you should probably avoid, too uninteresting for me) which translates to the game maybe outstaying its welcome. A good brain exercise all in all.

Tucking cards under other cards is a hassle, and I don't like passing hand cards around in the middle of the game. Otherwise, this reminds me of Pi Mal Pflaumen with set collection replaced by tile laying. I vastly prefer PMP to Honshu, but this is an OK game as well. Needs more interaction!

Before playing this I went in with the mentality that the map building far outshone the trick taking and that was mostly true. I do think there's a bit more strategy in the trick taking then originally shows even with having to pass your hand after 3 tricks.

The map building is a lot of fun though and that's where the game shines the best. It's neat trying to determine how to place your tile and it's fun trying to figure out how to best use your resources.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Gorgeously illustrated - the card backs and box cover are tremendous - this is a bit different - a trick-taker combined with a territory building game. The territory building works well, with very straightforward rules (over/under-lap at least one square each time but don't cover lakes) letting you concentrate on the - nicely varied - scoring. In comparison, the trick taking is the weaker part if the game but is straightforward and plays quickly, driving the game on (and, to be fair, may become more nuanced than is immediately apparent once you have more experience ). It's nice too that the game provides for some variety as you gain experience, with the varied alternate starting cards and the optional objective cards. 

In the light of all that I'm aware that it's carping to complain that the territory card graphics aren't as attractive as the the luscious pastels decorating the box and card backs but they're so lovely that I'd love to see similar illustrations appearing on the territory cards too - with cherry blossom replacing forests and rice paddies replacing fallows and,  perhaps, mountains replacing lakes so you can build a chain of Fujis ... hopefully for the second edition.

While I thought the game was fun, I also felt like using the term "trick-taking" for this game is a bit of a stretch. It more feels like a bidding game than a trick-taking game, where you bid for the right to choose a card earlier than the other players.

Even as a bidding game, though, there's a bit of cleverness that you can add a cube to your bid to add to your bid's value, which is some times a tough decision as those cubes can also be worth points.

Once you take a card after the bidding phase, the game is a fairly simple game of adding cards to your own personal map, arranging them in a way that scores you the most points as possible.

If you're looking for the next great trick-taker, this probably isn't it, as I really wouldn't call this a trick-taking game (which was a tad disappointing as I'm a trick-taking fan and was looking forward to that element here), but the game is still fun for what it is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The best thing I can say about this is that it's quick. Each turn you bid for cards. The final bidder always has the option to trump and is the only one who knows what they are bidding on completely. Each card will get you points. You will acquire thirteen of them while playing. The goal is to nickle and dime your way to victory.

At the end of the game you have some points and an ugly collection of cards in front of you. This game lacks tension, interesting decisions, and beauty. But, it's over quickly so the whole thing feels rather harmless overall.

This was the only recently released game I bought after playing at Origins.  It's a little lighter than my usual tastes, so the score has a chance of falling to a 7 after more plays - but I think it has quite a bit of depth for a tile laying game.

RATING: 5
I loved the idea, but. Is doesn't seem like it really has legs as an interesting trick taking game. The lead seems too powerful with the ability to keep grabbing cubes to keep the lead. Keeping the cubes for points doesn't seem worth enough. That said, in most cases, players can do just fine with just about any card. So, without the differentiation, it just didn't feel like there were a lot of hard decisions. The closeness of the scores pretty much confirmed that. Not sure the optional scoring card will make that much difference.

RATING: 5
A simple auction tile laying game. This is a marriage of patchistory with the bidding mechanism from Pi Mal Pflauen. The game works reasonably well for 3+ players, except that the resource bid topups are too expensive until the end unless you are going for a low manufacturing strategy. For 2 players, the blind bidding variant exacerbates that problem, since you have to pay 2 cubes and have zero knowledge of the other player's bid. If not played as a light filler, the game will likely induce AP due to the many options for patching. Overall, a nice concept but a slightly underdeveloped game. Contrast with Cacao, to see how much better this game could have been.

+ the patching mechanism and scoring method, especially the scoring cards, work well
+ small footprint and box size
+ easy to teach and fun to play with casual gamers

= suffers from AP, which might be a good or bad thing, depending on how leisurely you play

- the 2P variant does not work well, card playing has very limited decisions
- the art makes it hard to differentiate at a glance among various terrain types on your board
- under-patching can be a bit fiddly
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like this probably more than I should. Maybe it just looks really nice. It's almost completely solitaire, as it's really impossible (or not worth the time) to try and figure out what each player can do with each of the cards available when choosing.  I like it with people who are willing to just play relatively briskly. It loses its appeal with gamers who take it too seriously.

Why I got rid of it:

It is a nice land building game with a "WHAT THE HELL?" bidding that preceeds each build round.  I could hardly tell which card I wanted each round as I found I had a spot that would work for each of them.  Cannot understand how a publisher didnt notice the bidding was dull and useless.

I really enjoyed being able to build a Patchistory-like tableau without having to spend 3 hours on Patchistory. But it didn't grab me as much as I'd hoped; I think the quality of one's map is just a hair too simple for me, and while using the cards you're playing as the bidding elements is quite clever it didn't end up creating game situations I found tremendously interesting. (I did like the ability to spend resources to up bids.)

This may just be a case of disappointment after super-high expectations; I'll have to try it again to see.

Interesting game where you are placing cards in order to grow different terrain elements to gain points.  We have played it a lot with four and also with two (10 or so plays).  It's OK.  Nothing great, nothing wrong with it, just OK.  Ultimately, it's not as satisfying to us as Hanging Gardens, which has a similar terrain-building feel.  Therefore, I'm not interested in owning a copy.

An auction game where you use the cards you wish to add to your tableau for their auction value. For example, you may really want to add this #9 card to your tableau but 9 isn’t going to win the auction when the cards go up to 60. You may, however, power your bids by adding a cube for +60 and make that #9 card a 69 bid – but so can other players if they have the same color of cube. Use of these colored cubes to power bids is why some people are calling this a “trick taking game” FWIW. 

The rest of the game is reminiscent of Patchistory whereby you have to cover up some part of your card tableau with newly acquired cards. Then it’s standard VP scoring via different methods but most due to proximity (city spots by city spots, lakes by lakes, etc.). 

Potential for lots of downtime as people go through all their options for which card to add to their tableau and where. But that is the ostensible fun of the game, so if spatial pattern planning for VPs is your thing, you’ll like this, otherwise look elsewhere, especially for trick-taking.

This game looks very pretty an is fun to play. 

It does have a few problems. The bidding phase is not that interesting as almost every card can be used usefully. I've never seen anybody pay with their resources to get first pick.

Furthermore the tile-laying part is annoying as it is hard to slide cards underneath or between each other.

It's still a good game, but it could have been much better in my opinion.

In Honshu players bid for landscape tiles that they place in their private areas using the patching mechanism from Patchistory. The landscape features then score points at the end of the game.
The game generally feels new and different (which is good) but unfortunately doesn't quite come together. For one thing, the tiles aren't all that different, and you can usually make do with whatever you get, resulting in rather flat auctions which are further exacerbated by the very restricted bids you can make. It just rarely leads to interesting play situations.

Tile/Card placement with a bidding element (the card you bid gets added to the pool and you pick from that)

The card placement aspect is similar to Hanging Gardens. The bidding aspect seemed very out of place here because you could never be sure of what you'd get. Most higher cards are good where as lower cards usually weren't but you could augment your lower card's bid with a cube (making it a trump in a manner of speaking)

Overall the bidding aspect didn't work for me and the tile laying part was pretty boring because much of the scoring was sameish and you can't really plan out your next building card very well. Unfortunately we played with the lake bonus card which actually makes it LESS interesting because then you don't worry about lake placement for scoring since it'll always be 2pts

RATING: 6.5
Light card game that it's easy to play and teach. It is rather simple and the division of the game into two phases doesn't quite work. Since most cards are useful in one way or another, most of the time you want to pick your own card. Occasionally you will choose another card, but more often than not you will pick your own. Expanding the map is fun and every time you play you will end up with a totally different city. Honshu is the kind of game that requires an expansion to really shine.

I love the patching in this game, but I agree with many others that the card-selection mechanism isn't that exciting. I agree that the game probably needs something so you aren't stuck with just luck of the draw, but I might try something else to keep the pace brisk. (Our first game took us an hour after the rules explanation. This should not be.)

Cute little system to tinker with, but getting your choice of cards doesn't seem nearly as important as 'board' strategy, so the whole trick-taking aspect is mostly a distraction, I think?

I love the ability to be able to craft my own little city especially with these little cards.  Because they are cards, they are a little fiddly (do not play this is a highly ventilated area or where there is a breeze) and the numbers on each card are slightly irrelevant, but the game still plays very nicely.

Creating your personal area with various types of terrain and other features is nothing new, but it can be interesting and engaging if done properly. Instead of the usual tiles, here you have cards divided into six squares, overlapping like the "orb" in one of the expansions of "Race for the Galaxy". However, the game feels more like a "Kingdomino" with a more convoluted scoring system.

But it's "Kingdomino" done wrong. That game created interesting decisions by forcing players to choose between a more valuable tile or going earlier on the next round. "Honshu" has an auction for choosing order, but it feels pointless, as the cards with better scoring potential also have higher bidding values. To make it worse, after having used half of their hands, the players must pass their remaining cards around. This was probably intended to balance luck of the draw, and it might in extreme cases, but, in practice, the result is that everyone plays their best cards early.

The spatial puzzle is not devoid of interest, although it suffers with too many placement possibilities. The auctions, though, seem shoehorned to force player interaction. It's not a bad game, but it doesn't stand out in any way.

A trick-taking map-making game with an emphasis on the map-making. It's a pretty light card game offering some decision-making in the trick-taking phase and then testing your perception skills when laying the cards.(2.6.17)

Not too hot on Honshu anymore. The cards are all pretty similar so there's not any tension in the auction-trick-taking part and then it's just everyone making their cities by themselves. (6.10.17)

It is pseudo trick-taking meets Hanging Gardens tile placement. You'll build a sprawling colorful card city and score points at the end based on how different attribute are built and if you were able to convert some of your cubes on your map into points.

The "trick-taking" element determines priority for picking a card among those played, thus why I said pseudo trick-taking. You don't win by taking tricks or a certain amount of tricks, but by what you do with the cards that you acquire.

RATING: 7
Inexplicably billed as a trick-taking game, this is an auction game through-and-through. Cards are mini-maps - a mix of six different possible area types on six spaces, numbered 1-60. Some spaces produce a single resource of four possible types. Players are dealt a starting hand of six cards and put a card up for auction each turn, with the bid value equal to the value on the card played. Players can spend a resource from their "province" (personal tableau) in order to increase their bid by 60 points (so bid values is # of resources + card value). When cards and bids have been placed, the players select cards to add to their tableaux in winning bid order. Players "patch" in cards by over or underlaying them on existing cards. Players work through two hands of six cards - passing cards midway through each hand - and then score their province. Different area types score differently. Resources not used for bidding can be moved to matching factory spaces for points.

The biggest problem with the game is the static bidding. All cards could be fit into your tableau, so nobody gets really shafted, but the small differences - if attended to - can be the difference in winning or losing. Players early in turn order are asked to bid without knowing what they are bidding on other than their own contribution, while the player in last bids with full knowledge. If you can overlook that discrepancy (the order changes a lot and should balance out), then the rest of the game is great for those of us who like fitting pieces together and optimizing our personal puzzles. I enjoyed this one quite a bit.

Some interesting mechanics to manipulate the turn order, coupled with the city building elements. Unfortunately, the execution is not great since the cards are small and thin. Manipulating them causes a mess. Try Kingdomino for a faster game in the same vein.

Honshu is an absolutely delightful game. It combines trick taking and building a city out of the cards you win. I like games that build things by overlapping cards, such as [thing=34707]The Hanging Gardens[/thing] and [thing=144041]Patchistory[/thing]. 

In addition to having a rank, each card is divided into 6 squares, each square has a terrain type: city, lake, forest, ect... You must overlap (or underlap) at least one square, but you cannot underlap water. The various terrains score differently at the end of the game. 

Gameplay is simple. Each player plays a card, the players then choose cards based on the ranks of the cards they played. The player who played the highest ranked card chooses first, ect... The added wrinkle is that players may have coloured cubes on special spaces in their tableau. 

You can play a single cube with your card to make that card trump. Once a cube has been played only cubes of the same colour can be used that trick. The highest card is the highest ranked trump card and so on. There are also factory spaces that will score unused cubes of specific colours at the end of the game.

It's a short game with elegant rules and a fun sense of building something. Although it is a trick taking game it lacks a lot of the decisions typical in the genre. This is because there is only one suit with 60 ranks. As a seasoned trick-taking player this throws the logic circuits off a bit. The incremental value of cards is not clearly delineated, and as a result the card play is lacking. The use of cubes as a trump helps add some decision making to the tricks.

I really enjoyed my plays of this and plan on grabbing it as soon as it shows up. Which should be very soon.

Honshu already was on my radar before Spiel 2016 but after reading first impressions that dismissed it due to its potential of inducing AP in prone players, I was prepared to give it a miss as well. The greater was the positive surprise when we got a table with Honshu set up on Sunday noon at the fair.

The combination of trick-taking and tile-laying succeeds. Players will think for a while but seeing your landscape grow through patching the cards is satisfying enough to bear some AP. There's enough here for gamers although it's probably best suited for casual players that take their decisions gut-based.

Relatively enjoyable combination of light trick taking, light hand and resource management and the patching mechanism introduced in Patchistory. Four well implemented ways to score points and neat looks add to the positives. On the negative side there may be a surprising level of AP taking place at times, choices in trick taking aren't most often interesting and there is an annoying production choice in not including sufficient amount of cubes. The two player mode is utterly boring and quite random.

A well designed compact card game, but it could be even more streamlined (and better): I see very little reason why players are changing their cards. And patching -system could be more simplified as well - now you can put cards top/under previous ones however you like which makes things sometimes too fiddly. Is this the best "patching" game there is? No, at least Hanging Gardens makes things easier and there the scoring is more interesting one. After 5-10 Honshu games played the overall feel is always the same and you'll always collect same amount of points (it doesn't matter how you collect them; it feels that the game is too balanced). But yes, ok game which I'm ready to play every now and then.

After several more plays, I have sold my copy. The trick taking is barely there and the spatial puzzle, while interesting, is better done in Hanging Gardens. 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Not as tense as I was hoping. This is much more of a spatial puzzle patching cards together (which I do enjoy) than it is a trick taking game. Cards are numbered 1-60 which represents the card's strength which can be enhanced by 60 if a cube is played with the card. The cards may not be all that different overall so I'm not certain being last is much worse than going first. We did play with the special scoring deck which in retrospect I wish we would have played with a different one as it made the first game a bit on the boring side (special card made water scoring the same as forest scoring). I believe the other special scoring cards look much more interesting in making the game a bit different.

[b]Pleasant, map-building card game piques interest with challenge to arrange cards for maximum points.[/b]
r{[i]Colorful theme compliments straightforward game play.[/i]}r

SYNOPSIS
Honshu is a tile-laying game using cards instead of tiles to build personal maps depicting purposefully arranged features, viz. cities, forests, resource collection and production areas, lakes and deserts. Over twelve rounds players bid with numbered map cards from their hand which then are claimed by players and used to extend their maps, overlapping cards with each new placement. Cards depict a grid of six landscape squares representing but a few of the available features. Since adding to a map requires covering one or more landscape squares on a card, the real challenge comes from determining how best to arrange the features on newly added cards into one's map to score the most points at game's end.

COMMENTS
There's a certain satisfaction in building ones's map and watching it grow card by card, coupled with simmering anticipation to claim cards with desired features as rounds progress. The bidding system to determine turn order for selecting cards (not exactly trick-taking) seems rather arbitrary at first glance since several serviceable cards are typically available each round, but it can be useful in obtaining the right card at the right time. Plus, the opportunity to augment one's bid with gained resources provides an additional, thoughtful choice in a game that rewards subtle advantages. A short play time keeps the simple, procedural decisions of this game interesting in the half hour or so it takes to complete. Optional rules for scoring variants are an added bonus to vary play from game to game.

PROS+, CONS- & NOTES*
+ Simple rules and iconography make game easy to learn/teach.
+ Puzzle-like quality to building map is engaging.
- General tendency for bidding and card passing to be anticlimactic.
* Cards included to alter scoring with optional variants.

I've been interested in this since I saw photos of it. It's an attractive little game, and I like building little cities. 

The game play is neat, both the card play part and the building part. It's easy to learn, fun, quick, and gives you a pleasant achievement to look at when you're done.

Sadly, I don't think I'll get to spend more time in Honshu, as it's the kind of light filler game that hardly ever gets played in my groups.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Initial Impressions: This is a weird game. I'm still not completely sure separating the suit from the value works (via the cubes) as a trick taking game, but I am fairly bad at the genre in general so what do i know. The map placement can get surprisingly challenginf later on, but I think checking to see all the configurations to see which card would benefit my opponents the most would drag the game too much, so I mostly only choose based on what helps me, although there are a few cards that seem to be almost always better than others, so makes turn order more important in that regard.

The city building/tile portion of the game is fun and leads to interesting placement decisions.  Since you're covering up at least one square of a card with each placement, it gives you a ton of options on how to play out your city.

RATING: 7
Players play a card into a trick, which determines turn order in drafting the cards. Then simply place the card into your kingdom, various region types score differently. You always need to cover up some part of your kingdom, which is where the decision making gets tricky. Borrows a bit from Cities, except each player isn't playing the same card. However, they do add a cool little mechanic with tiles that produce resources. The resources can be placed in factories at the end of the game to score points OR they can be added to a card during the game to add trump to the trick.

Honsu ist ein Legespiel mit Stichmechanik. Dabei versuchen die Spieler mit ihren Karten eine mittelalterliche Stadt zu bauen. Dabei muss immer mindestens ein Teil der Karte, eine andere Karte "überlappen". Dabei entstehen Städte, Seen, Wälder und auch Manufakturen, die die eigenen Ressourcen in Siegpunkte umwandeln. Der Stickmechanismus entscheidet, welcher Spieler zuerst eine Karte wählen darf. Von der reinen Mechanik ist Honshu ein tolles, kleines Spiel. Mich stört das völlig austauschbare Thema. Die Karten sind überhaupt nicht stimmig gestaltet und vermitteln zu keiner Zeit, dass man sich im japanischen Mittelalkter befindet. Schade, hier hätte eine gelungene Implementierung des Themas ordentlich Pluspunkte gegeben.

Pleasant, straightforward; I find the bidding mechanism rather bolted on--this could probably have been a straight drafting game with not much of a loss--and the fiddliness of dealing with adding cards to your area without disturbing everything else is a bit irritating (also likely to lead to substantial wear and tear after only 2-3 games). But it's a solid game, and it's quite appealing building your landscape and growing your town. I suspect a computer implementation would solve the fiddliness issues and make this really shine.

RATING: 7.9
A cracking little card game where each round you play a card and then choose a landscape tile to "patch" into your tableau. Some landscapes generate resources which can be used to increase the value of your card played or keep to give VPs at the game end.
This has a lot going on for such a simple game.
After a second game I am starting to really like this game. Rating increased.

Honshu is a neat game. You use basic trick taking to sort out the turn order and first choice at the cards used in the trick. Then you will build your map using that card. Points are earned in various ways and present some interesting decisions. While the trick taking remains in convincing the game overall wins me over!

RATING: 7
John K. is right -- this is a drafting game, not a trick-taking game.  THAT SAID.

Honshu is a high-and-tight drafting game experience, with solid choices for when to use resources for "trump" vs, end-game points.  The only issue I have with the game, after close to 10 plays, is that I've never seen someone lose if they pursue the lake strategy full-tilt.  It's not a shortcoming of the game... but if one doesn't hate-draft against it from time to time, one will lose sight of everyone's forest for their own trees, and it's very easy to forget.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First impression (3, 4 players) :
Trick-taking part of the game doesn't feel as meaningful as it could be. Optimizing the city is puzzle I tend to like in games and it is true in Honshu too. Four and Five-player games of this type have all similar problem that trying to anti-optimize for remaining / all players is starting to take too much mental burden or then you don't do it and find out later that you really should've .. both things I don't like.

Still despite my preferences Honshu is fun and good optimizing puzzle type game.

RATING: 6
A decent, simple auction/city building card game. The tucking of the cards is clever and all, but it made things a bit too fiddly. I really felt like the luck of the draw hurt/helped players way too much in the auctioning phase to be acceptable. Holding all low cards? You choose last in all auctions.

RATING: 6
I enjoy the map building and in theory I always liked the idea of using (somewhat) trick-taking as a mechanic to do something else, but the trick-taking part in this one feels somewhat tagged on and I often don't care too much about the trick-taking part, almost wish there was just a different way to pick the cards, otherwise it's a neat little map/city building game.

RATING: 7
We like card games and this is a winner. Honshu throws in a tiny resource management element that gives it a twist compared to our other card games. Simple rules but some surprisingly hard choices to make. The bidding aspect definitely makes the game play very different from 2 players even up to just 3.

RATING: N/A
It's a puzzly, spatial card-laying game, by way of trick-taking, with some resource management thrown in and a splash of drafting. WUT??????

And I like it very much! There's so much *more* going on than trick-taking that you quickly forget it's primary mechanic is trick-taking.

[b]Honshu[/b] + The Castles of Burgundy: The Dice Game were traded away 1/5/18. (Received Tatsu)

A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> [b]6[/b]):[/COLOR]

[i]I'm definitely on the fence with Honshu; I played it a bunch early on and lately it's been sitting on the shelf. While I really enjoy the tile laying aspect of the game, I'm starting to find the game play to be very repetitive. Games are typically close and with a little bit of planning you almost always have a good play. The game lacks any real tension because of this, it is not often worth the price of spending a resource to get a card you "want" since the other card isn't much worse. Granted most of my plays have been with two so maybe in 3+ player games there would be more incentive to spend resources for cards. We've also played with the end game bonus cards which will change how one feature will score, but while this seems like it would make a big impact I didn't find that they added much variance to the game. 

In my initial write up I compared it to Parade, Arboretum and some of my other favorite card games unfortunately a year later Honshu hasn't stacked up. I'll need to see what my kids think first, but I have a feeling this won't be in our collection much longer.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8/10):[/COLOR]

[i]From the first play I really enjoyed Honshu. At first blush the trick taking element appears to take a back seat to the tile laying aspect. However; upon further inspection the designer was very specific as to how the resources, etc. are laid out based on the number of the card (check out this thread for the designer's explanation). After the trick taking phase you move onto card placement which really improves on the basic tile laying mechanic because you can overlap and tuck cards under the existing cards in your tableau based on how you are trying to build your province. That's it, you end the game with a 13 card tableau of cards that you score; there are end game bonus scoring cards that you can use that will change the base game scoring rules which will change how you play to varying degrees.

I hadn't heard of this game before Essen, but once I did I got a copy since I am a sucker for card games. Honshu delivers and will see lots of play in my house and I am almost certain it'll be a hit with my wife (which has become a rare feat). Honshu is the perfect balance of depth to playtime similar to other card game favorites like Arboretum, Parade and Musee. [/i]

Honshū is a card-laying game where you add keep adding cards to your city to increase its scoring elements. In addition to city elements, cards have a numerical value, and once all players have played their card in a round, players choose and add one of these cards to their city in descending numerical order. The city cards themselves are divided into six segments, and at least one segment has to cover over (or be tucked under) an existing segment. I wasn't really that enthused by this game--it felt very bland to me.

I do love the card-placing mechanism where you cover up part of on of your cards. An interesting puzzle mechanic. The trick-taking rules were incorrectly explained to us.

Definitely a hit at Essen. I have played 3 times so far and it is quite a challenging game. It is played like a trick taker but more like [thing=181761][/thing] with players only collecting one card in order based on the value of the card they played. The card is then played into a personal player area like in [thing=144041][/thing]. Can be a bit fiddly but it plays quickly and is a very nice game. I very much enjoy it. Probably best with 3p.

RATING: 2
I typically like tile laying games where you build a city, but this one didn't work for me. The way it happens here is you get a hand of six cards, then you choose and play one. Then whomever played the highest numbered card gets first pick of all the cards everyone played. I'm not sure why you wouldn't robotically always play the highest numbered card. Then you add that card to your tableau, covering at least one corner of one of the cards. The cards have different types of features that all score in different ways. This aspect was what drew me to want to try the game. Then, after three plays like this, you pass your hand to the next player for no discernable reason, and then play the three remaining cards in the same way. I would much rather play other games, because I don't understand what the justification for, or advantage is in getting the cards this way.

It's billed as a spatial trick-taker but, like Pi Mal Pflaumen, it's closer to an auction, and a slightly limp one at that since there isn't much differentiation between the items bid on. The individual puzzle part of it is quite neat though - 'patching' cards over and under each other to build a city.

Was pleasantly surprised by this game. Wasn't expecting much going into it but this game is reasonably interesting. I do worry that scores will be pretty close to each other no matter what players do, meaning I fear the strategy doesn't have much depth. The placement of cards was really quite clever though and gives the game some tough choices to make without overwhelming anyone with rules. Ultimately though I didn't find there to be anything special to make this game really stand out as anything other than a fairly average game. I'd certainly play again but probably won't be seeking it out.

interesting city builder not unlike Kingdomino, but with one flaw: people assume it's a trick-taker and they find that bit rather arbitrary. everyone i've played with has been entirely skeptical of how to play the trick (or auction) bit, although the overlapping cards are enjoyed. the cubes are mostly forgotten or relegated to secondary objective status as it's difficult to monopolize them on purpose due to chaos of cards played. i was really in love with this game when i got it, but less so after finding no one else to love it. also, like i said: in what world do you pick this over Kingdomino?

The game seemed a little confusing at first after watching a video on it, but after playing a few rounds it started clicking and I started getting into the game's mechanics. There's been a lot of city-building 'multiple types of scoring' games this past couple of years. I think it's better than Between Two Cities but not quite as good as Quadropolis, except it's more portable so it'd be easier to bring to more game nights. I also played Kingdomino, which felt similar but more steamlined and I think I enjoyed that more as well, but this is still a good game and worth checking out.

Pi mal Pflaumen with Patchistory. A type of trick taking with pattern matching. The core mechanic is a good one - a very fair turn order mechanism, but there's a lot less player interaction here than with Pi mal Pflaumen. You're pretty much maximising your own "city" and grabbing what's best for you. I prefer the interaction of the former as you try and prevent opponents fulfilling their contracts, but this is sufficiently different for me to admire it too, even if the city building aspect is a bit bland and easy. Unfortunately play does slow down a fair bit as the rounds go by and players think more about their optimal card acquisition and placement on the final turns. I'm perfectly happy to play this little package filler though. A good little game and nicely balanced it should see very close games.

Clever drafting game with a spatial puzzle-y play that Mary (again!) did much better than I!

Everyone starts with some cards on the table. Cards (numbered) show a grid with different features including production factories and industries that convert cubes to points. They also have a hand of cards. Each round you reveal several cards from the deck. Everyone reveals a card. In descending order (you can spend a cube in your tableau to pump up the value of the card you played), they choose one of the cards from the display and add it to their tableau. The new card must be played either under or on top of another card, overlapping at least one square of the grid. At the end of the game, convert as many cubes in your tableau as you can to VP. The colors also score (e.g., your largest contiguous city area, or the total number of forests). Most VP wins!

Fun, but I don't love the 2er variant where you have to trade hands after 3 cards have been played (especially when I seem to have gotten a bunch of low numbered cards!). You also change the flop: each round, you flip 2 cards from the deck = a pair. Then both players simultaneously play their cards, forming a second pair. In descending order (2nd player can add a cube to increase card value), you're now choosing a pair of cards: add one to your tableau, discard the other.

RATING: 7
This is a filler card game where you are building a city. You build your city/kingdom by placing cards down. You can overlap the cards, but you cannot cover the desert square, which makes for an interesting puzzle. There is also a trick taking aspect to obtain the card you will place in your city. This mechanic failed and seemed to have little meaning in the game. Ultimately this is an okay game, that had potential to be more if the trick taking aspect was improved.

I got this game at Essen Spiel 2016 and was pleasently surprised about it! 
It´s a cardgame about building a city and making sure that you get resources and distribute them to factorys that you also have to build. 
It´s a fast playing game, perfect for 2. In fact I would even say it´s better with 2 that 5 (I have tried both). 

It has simple rules but is not too light because you need to strategize a lot in the building of your city. 
The deal is to, in each round, pick a card and build it in your own little town, and when doing this you can´t build adjecent to another card but you need to slide the new card underneath or place on top of a preexisting card. Thereby always covering something up and that´s the fun part in the game - What do you cover up?

The mechanism is fine, but it takes a while and is not as fun as the actual card placement/planning. Still I enjoy the dual usage of the cubes and the way they can lock in a trick.

Based on length of time it takes to play and ease of teaching, I consider it a filler, but it's a filler that I actually enjoy playing.

Tableau-building game where cards are drafted with a sort of trick-taking mechanism; each card has a number and whomever plays the highest gets to choose first this round and lead the next. Each card has a pattern of six squares and must patched into that player's tableau (over/under) a la Patchistory or Edo Yashiki. At the end of the game, different areas score in different ways (2VP/forest, 1VP per city square in largest city etc.). Variety is added by the scoring cards; one is chosen per game to slightly adjust the scoring rules.

It's supposed to be a filler but placement options are huge. The design encourages AP micro-optimization, but there are so many options that it is not feasible to consider every available card without taking far, far too long. Worse, it's essentially impossible to plan, so time spent in deep analysis is likely wasted.

I feel like the design probably started with the card placement and then the trick-taking/drafting edifice was built up around it. It feels both overcomplicated and undercooked, adding little meaningful interaction at the cost of doubling the game length. At the same time, I don't see how to add that interaction any better way: the best version of this is probably even more multiplayer solitaire, so I don't think there exists any universe where I would want to play it.

[Lautapelit.fi 17 edition] {Japan; card-drafting, pattern building; optimal 4p} I am a fan of trick taking games.  So, I got this game when it claims to be a trick taking game. But sadly it isn't really one ... luckily it's a good family game.

This is not a strict trick taking game, in my definition.  Yet, each player does take a card from each trick.

The core of the game is to build a map of specific patterns such as lake and town, and to manage production resources for factories.

This is a neat game.  Players have meaningful decisions to make, not subject to luck.  Being a trick leader isn’t fun because you don’t know what cards would appear and it is risky to spend resources with the first card in a trick.  So, it balances the play - being a trick winner can select a good card from the trick but you would be “blind” when you lead the next trick.

I can’t understand the importance of passing hand yet.

The card illustration is effective with wise use of icons.  But the final map is a little too busy.  I agree with other players' comments - it's clumsy to pass the cards around.  I use the tiles from Rummikub to indicate player orders.

I love trick-takers.  This one offers the trick taking with a game based off it much how A Few Acres of Snow built an actual game out of deck-building.

Very simple rules.  Works really well for 2.  Haven't even played it with more.  Could be a perfect 10 down the road.

Good mechanics and easy rules make it a fun experience. I think its too long for what it is and perhaps playing cards simultaneous would speed this up quite a bit, not sure whatever thinking you spend on determining what card to play is put to good use; youre still at the mercy of what is played after. Moreoever I dont think it really adds tothe game experience. 12.22.17 drewawizard

tl;dr: fun, but very open

The concept of a trick-taking city building game sounded weird and intriguing. I guess you could also put it a different way, as you don't actually take the trick. It's more an auction for turn order.
After turn order is established, every player gets to take one of the played cards and add that to it's tableau. The way in which you add those has very few rules. The result is a great freedom in building your city. This resulted in me not feeling very challenged. I felt like I was winning big by not trying very hard, and that proved to be true.
So I did enjoy this, and maybe I just got lucky, but I certainly would like to play again.

Very cool twist on trick taking.  The spatial puzzle is hard enough without also having to contend with passing and watching what your opponent is doing.  I liked it quite a bit, but it seems like it would be pretty hard to play it optimally.

I like the idea of playing a trick taking game in order to draft cards which you then use to build a civilization from the cards you selected (which are also the cards you played), but in reality the trick taking was pretty automatic, the downtime too long for the choices on offer and the civ-building too determined on the tricks played. The luck of the draw seemed way too important and thought the spending of resources was a clever addition to mitigate that, it didn't help out all players equally.

In summary, lots of clever ideas, but lacking polish and depth.

I'm a huge trick-taking fan. While this game isn't actually trick-taking (it's more along the lines of the card-drafting in Plums), it has a very similar feel.

You play cards in turn order and then draft the cards that you just played in order of who played the highest card. You then add the cards to your tableau in front of you, making a map and getting more points by placing in different configurations.

I like the game, but I do think we're reaching the limit of games with this type of spatial scoring system. Forests are worth a flat amount of points. Lakes are worth more if they are contiguous. Only your largest set of city spaces scores. Etc. Quadropolis, Between Two Cities, Dream Home, Oceanos, and many others use this sort of set collection and they all feel pretty similar.

Also, passing your hand of cards to an opponent after three rounds seems a little odd. This just incentivizes you to play your high cards quickly so that you don't pass good cards to your opponent. I suppose if everyone does that then it will even out, but it just feels a little out of place.

Enjoyed my one play so far, definitely liked it more than Plums (Pi mal Pflaumen). Will rate after more plays.

Update: Played again. I definitely like it and will play again, just don't know if I'll be buying it myself. It's best with 4-5 players, and there's quite a few great card games for those player counts already.

Honshu is very easy to teach new players, has _just_ enough complexity to keep it interesting for me, but is also light enough that it's approachable for my friends who don't play a lot of games. It's not something I'd feature on game night with those who prefer heavier strategy games, but I think even they'd enjoy it. Honshu has the right balance of being a little more than just light filler while not overstaying its welcome.

Honshu is sort of a trick-taking city building game... except it's not so much about taking tricks as determining turn order. You start with 6 cards, and you'll go through a weird kind of draft. The person who "took the last trick" leads a card. The cards are suitless but have a number between 1 and 60 and city features on them. The person leading the card can spend a single cube of his choice that adds 60 to the value of the card. Every other player (in turn order) follows his lead by putting down their own card and choosing whether to spend a cube of the same color.

Turn order is adjusted by the number order of the played cards, highest first, each player takes a card from the ones played in the round and "builds" it into their city. It must overlap or underlap an existing card to some degree. You repeat this until you only have 3 cards left, which you pass to the next player. You draw back up to 6 cards and repeat. You'll repeat this every third round playing 12 rounds total.

Cards come with different features, resource spots (that come with a cube of the appropriate color on them), city buildings, forests, lakes, scrub land, and factories which consume a particular type of cube at game end. Just to make the game tough, lakes can't be covered up.

When the game ends you score 1 point for every city building in your largest contiguous chain, 2 points for each forest whether contiguous or not, 3 points for any contiguous lakes (though nothing for a singleton), 2-4 points if you can place a cube of the appropriate color on a factory that needs it. The scrub land scores nothing but is a tie-breaker.

This is a really clever game and I quite enjoyed it. I didn't appreciate the value of the cubes in the early game. Not only are the good for factories, but they can give you a real boost when trying to get turn order. And when you're leading you can effectively decide who won't be able to cube-follow your cube-lead. I'm a big trick-taking fan and it's neat to see a trick-taking game that does something a bit more. This was a lot of fun.

Honshu is a puzzlegame in which the puzzle pieces themselves (the cards) have a number on them to determine the order in which players select the card they want from among those played. Highest number gets first pick, unless a resource is played to increase a card value with 60 points. This means, however, that the resource can no longer be used to generate victory points. The only trick-taking element of the game is that you have to follow suit if someone played a resource of a particular color before you. Honshu is easy to learn and plays quickly. A great (and quite unique) cardgame to enjoy with the whole family!

Trick-taking actually works well together with the patching mechanic here. Theme is pasted on but that is okay. The only downside is that it is very AP-prone and downtime is a bit too much as you wait for the trick winner to pick his card. Then again playing it casually just seems pointless so I would accept some thorough thinking to not make the game pointless. Would play again but one should not make the mistake based on appearance that this can be fitted into a filler time-slot.

We played 'Honshu' recently, essentially where players develop a sixteenth century city by overlapping on cards they bid and select for in 'card value' sequence.

I forgot that the commercial parts of the city needed to be contiguous as did the lakes, so with cards having six plot types, the tactical decisions were around which ones to place where.

I didn't listen to Chris Taylor's very good instructions and so my final score was low. Proud to be last! A game I would recommend and play again as it will have plenty of permutations.

I liked the patching mechanism in Patchistory but not much else about the game- for one it was way too long for what it offered. Honshu takes this mechanic and weaves it with a simple but intriguing auction, the result being a very good 60-75 minute game. With repeat plays the auction phase is proving to be more subtle and entertaining than I first thought, and also a reason I think I prefer the game at higher player counts despite the added downtime.

I'm not quite sold on the trick-taking part of the game. Although it works as a way to determine an order for picking up cards, I don't quite see when it would be a viable option to just not go with your highest cards, especially since you switch hands on rounds three and nine of the game.  However, I did enjoy building up my little kingdom and figuring out how to best place new cards.

Update:  I think I actually enjoy playing this one 2P more than at other player counts. I think the card choosing phase is more interesting, and it doesn't feel so out of place mechanically.

One of those game I had quite low expectations (because people told me they had played it before without much joy...) but I had to change my mind. It's very simple and there are many things already seen elsewhere but also an intriguing mechanic: you place cards on the table to enlarge your city BUT you have to give up part of them. The way you have to fit the cards gives rise to interesting decisions: what do I give up here?

Simple rules, fast, 5 possible players... nice!

What a fun game. It is easy to learn but what you choose makes a difference. From using produced cubes to get an advantage to go first on picking cards to placing the right one in the right place.

Trick-taking city builder card game. Dual purpose cards serve as bid value and 2x3 terrain cards. In bid order select a card and add it to your region to add resources, buildings and terrain patterns for end game scoring.  I enjoy the simplicity of the game rules to focus on the puzzle challenge.  Several elements work well together.  I like that the cards provide bid values for us as opposed to having to math out bid values ourselves.  The meat of the game is having to overlapping placement of the new terrain card that almost always leads to a trade off and compromise of one objective for another.  I like the trump aspect by bumping the bid value by adding a resource cube.  The pre-bid decision process has a gin quality not wanting to give up something more valuable for your opponents regions.

I've enjoyed this card-laying game with an interesting twist on getting the cards. It's ultimately a bidding/trick-taking system, with different card values deciding who picks first. The point-scoring is a lot like Between Two Cities. Enjoyable, but definitely prone to some AP.

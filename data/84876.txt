RATING: 7
Fun game. A little annoying at the beginning to have to look at the directions every time you place a building or knowledge marker in your estate to see what advantages it gives you (there are a lot)  but my wife and I are slowly memorizing what all the buildings and markers do. Never ending strategies to win. Every game offers a new angle of play. Overall this game is worth the buy and has been one we have been playing every night since we've gotten the game.

RATING: 3
I enjoy it, but only at 2 and *maybe* 3p. Something about the downtime of 4p and the shift in strategy to heavy warehousing/shipping sort of sucks to me (but it doesn't bother me that strategy shifts in other games). At 2p, I find the game doesn't overstay it's welcome for being multiplayer solitaire combo chaining game. One of my largest complaints is that the downtime between turns as you add players, combined with the inability to make solid plans more than 2 plays in advance really hurts. Last, nothing really stands out about the game and makes me go "oh, I want to play this more."

I would describe this as a Feld gateway. If you haven't played a Feld before and want to get an idea of what his games are like, you should play this game. Loads of ways to score points, easy to learn but has lots of decisions to make. This is probably my second favorite Feld game I have played.

Looking at this primarily for 2-player, possibly leaning towards Carcassonne instead, partly due to CoB involving dice rolls ...

RATING: 9
A ton of game for the money. Components and theme leave a lot to be desired, but the mechanics shine through. Cries out for a deluxe edition.

I also like the way it scales. Very relaxing at 2p, tense and busy at 3p, not tried 4p but guessing it's even tougher.

Update: As much as I personally enjoy the game I'm quite surprised it's climbed into the top 10. My guess would be that the core 'dice = actions' and tile placement mechanics are so satisfying that it keeps players engaged long enough to get past the initially fiddly array of building types and knowledge tiles.

The go-to game for my wife and I. The mechanics are really tight, and the game is very enjoyable, even if you lose. I find the theme fitting, not lacking as others are saying. But I do however find the quality of the pieces and the colours troubleing. If there is a reprint with better pieces and a new coloursceme, I will buy it on day one, and turn my 9 to a 10.

RATING: 8
A game about building up your plot of land in the middle ages, acquiring mines, animals, buildings, boats etc. and using dice to limit your action choices.

This game is a bit of a departure for Feld in that there's almost always something good to do and its a game of point grabbing rather than a game where the game is hammering you.  Each turn you roll 2 dice which limit your actions you can do.  Actions are: 1) acquire a tile, 2) place a tile, 3) ship goods, 4) grab workers.  Points are scored in a myriad of ways: 1) animal tiles score, and can score cumulatively ala Taj Mahal, 2) shipping goods scores points on a per good basis, 3) completing regions scores as well as scores bonus points (the earlier you complete a region the greater the bonus), 4) one type of building has the function of points, 5) some knowledge tiles score for certain conditions at the end of the game such as building, animal type etc., 6) completing all regions of a one type score bonus points, 7) minor scoring of money, left over goods, and workers at game end.

Although your actions are limited by the dice, you have several options as to what to do each turn and the function of the worker tiles is to modify die rolls- a nice touch is that there is "wrapping" (6 to 1 for example).  I will say that despite this, dice rolls can be occasionally frustrating particularly if you consistently roll doubles (which I have a talent for).  The game plays 2-4; I have only played 2er so far but it works great at that number.  There are several different starting player boards which lend themselves to slightly different goals.  So far this is a very addictive and accessible game that the wife loves.

Stefan Feld's best game to date. The supreme euro gaming experience without the overt heaviness of games like Agricola and Caverna. A sublime two player experience that doesn't compromise at three or four. If you have a spare £30 or equivalent for this hobby and you don't own this, buy it, and you can still find it cheaper than that RRP.

RATING: 10
This is easily one of my favorite games.  I know that I should be sparing with "10s" but everything about this game does it for me.  I like the tile mechanics and the small combos you can make.  I like the multiple scoring options.  It is just an all round fun game that is relatively easy to teach and offers a lot of great decisions to make.  The dice rolling is fun and there are ways to mitigate bad dice rolls so you don't have to be frustrated by never getting what you want.

The game involves placing tiles, as in Glen More, to activate abilities and score points. The tiles selected are not chosen by a rondel, as in Glen More, but by rolling two dice and using tokens to manipulate the resources, as in La Venise Du Nord. Set-collection plays a  big role, gathering multiple tiles of the same colour scores you points and completing a coloured region gives you further bonuses, as in Thurn and Taxis. The rules explanation is fairly long due to the amount of tiles available with different features, but the game is an enjoyable puzzle, if a little dry.

Traded with expansions for Furstenfeld.

Burgundy is a much more relaxing game, you roll dice, pick which 1 of the 4 actions you want to do & you're done. The aim is to gain the most points while trying to fill up your player board. The best part is when you do some combos upon combos. And like Bora Bora, everything that you need to know is on the player board itself.

A nice balance between getting tiles, build them, selling goods & completing the areas.

LIKE: building stuff, combos
DISLIKE: fiddly. low player interaction. many icons that need to be looked up for first time players. the wife was unimpressed.
OVERALL: likable game, but the theme is very dry. it would take a few plays to get faster and see the subtleties of the game.

RATING: 9
When I was first getting into board games, this was a big hit.  I found the innovative use of dice and chaining of actions really fun.

I think this is best with 4 since there are so many more possibilities on your turn, but only if players take their turns fairly quickly.

If any game deserves a shiny new edition this is it: terrible colour scheme and "functional" components in the current edition.

Highly balanced, mechanically excellent Feld game. This one shows interlocking systems in a marvelous way with bowls of originality. However, it's likely only appealing to the true Euro-gamer who enjoys themeless adventures that are titillating simply because they offer up so many options with excellent rewards. I like this one very much.

Juegazo Eurogame! Otro gran Feld. Sin cartas, con dados, pero la suerte la "planificas". Es un juego de estrategia de construccion de zonas muy especial y logrado. De 2 a 4. Funciona perfecto, más rápido, con 2 o 3 jugadores. A 4 más pique indirecto, pero más largo y hay demasiado AP. Tienes que tener en cuenta muchas cosas y gusta mucho la toma constante de decisiones. Por contra, comentar que el factor suerte, tras varias partidas, se aprecia demasiado elevado para la media de los euros. Imprescindible las expansiones de tableros nuevos para el juego: la nueva regla de construcción en éstos, le añade un punto de mayor dificultad al juego. Se puede imprimir el tablero que Feld diseñó para el torneo de 2013.

RATING: 9
What a brilliant game. Clever use of dice feels always refreshing and helps in avoiding the pitfalls of over-analysing. Burgundy successfully combines two mechanics I like, tile laying and dice, into a streamlined set collecting. Sure luck plays a role but good players can turn apparently bad throws into their own advantage.  

Minor negatives are the dull art and the bad use of symbols. The meaning of some symbols is rather hard to understand just by looking at them. You'll need the manual.

RATING: 9
This is my kind of dice game.  Not only does the game allow for luck mitigation through the use of workers that can add or subtract from your dice, but rolling higher is in no way more beneficial than rolling lower.  The only difference between die results is what you can do with the die.

(+) Smooth and unique mechanics, nice balance of luck and skill, plays well at all player counts, great price, simple to teach but decently deep strategically, multiple player boards and random tiles for variability, limited amounts of "gotcha"

Superb design.  Masterful balance.  

About the only criticism that could be leveled at this game is the art direction.  Not so much the art itself, which I find to be acceptable (particularly given how small the hex tiles are), but the color scheme really just makes this look bland.  If one were to choose a color to describe [i]Castles of Burgundy[/i], perhaps surprisingly, that color would not be burgundy--it would be brown.  The whole color direction of the game just leaves one with the unescapable feeling of brown.  

However, the mechanics and balance of this really shine.  It's actually fairly intuitive and easy to teach (though there are many rules--what each building does, what each bonus tile does, when particular regions are scored and how they are scored, etc.)--the iconography on the player mats has helped me play this with even unseasoned gamers.  Despite dice, it has a great mechanic for mitigating the impact of poor rolls, and part of the design beauty of the game is the planning that can go into board positioning so that one leaves oneself with good options despite the actual numbers that come out on the dice.  

I can see why this is a popular contender for championship series.  I'm looking forward to trying a few of the mini-expansions which appear to all preserve the central core of the game (outside of maybe the shipping routes).

RATING: 9
This game has nothing to do with Ron Burgundy. It is, however, easily one of Stefan Feld's more well known games. Castles of Burgundy is a game about building your territory on your player tableu one drafted hexagonal chit at a time. You roll dice to determine what chits you are allowed to draft and where you are allowed to place them. Territories within your tableu can represent specific sets with powers that you can leverage to better score points. The theme and art are pedestrian unless you are a fan of pastoral landscapes and farm animals but the game design and play more than make up for it. One small gripe is that the game needs a insert or a Plano box or something that helps you keep all the chits sorted or you will spend a lot of time sorting each time you set up the game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I have mixed feelings for this game.

Components are cheap and dull.  
Setup/cleanup is tedious.

I also do not like dice rolling fest games although that one is an exception as it let you mitigate the luck factor in several clever ways.

All in all, the game flows well and requires a long terms strategy to win.  It also scale very well from 2 to 4 players.


Burgundy is surely not my favorite but I enjoy it nonetheless.

A really good game with lots of strategy and many paths to victory.  You have two things to do on your turn, but the decisions are ridiculously many.  

the only thing about this game is it's so easy to forgot some rules.  Like  you get one money thing when you sell, or you forget to get a large of small token when covering all of one color.  Or it's super easy to forget to have only one building type on a city.

+ Easy to teach; Fairly quick to play; Many different focuses that you can go for in an attempt to win.
- Can feel a bit same-y after playing the game multiple times.


Why it's previously-owned:

I ended up leaving this game with my relatives who feel in love with it's balance of strategy and ease-of-play.

Elegant dice worker placement game combined with tile laying. The tech tiles are a very symbolic and need to be learnt, which makes it a bit difficult for beginners. 
Works better with less players due to game length and due to the limited number of tiles that come out per game.
Unfortunately, play time is very high with more than 2 players.

Played it, figured out how to play it, and it was neat.

Due to dice, I lost the boat race badly, and spent the entire game (after the first round) going last, only able to pick up boats when the other two players had all 6 placed.

Even with REALLY bad dice luck (rolling doubles four turns in a row, for spots that were picked clean by the other two players who went first), I was still competitive, so that's positive, but it wasn't enjoyable.

Would not need to own, due to the playtime and that I found it to be "good, but not great."

A great gaming experience where everything fits together and you are left planning move after move and pulling out extra bits and pieces all the time. Not super interactive but it doesn't matter.

I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

This is the first "Victory Points Salad" that I tried. The Castles of Burgundy is a good game clearly, even fun in many aspects, but I don't like the feeling that it gives me. The game looks like "butter scraped over too much bread"... there're just too many ways to get points, which makes everything seem kinda pointless (no pun intended).

Also the components are HORRIBLE, like I saw also in other Feld's games. The board looks messy and abstract and my OCD screams of pain every time I see the curves at the end of the scoring track.

Plays amazingly with 2.  Excellent game to play with wife or lighter, relaxing gaming.  The logical next step after Carcasonne.

With 4 - the game doesn't gain anything, except downtime.  It's not bad, it's just not a 9.

A good euro, the first game played by me from this designer, Feld, it is an interesting and simple mechanic game, a classic euro style, with luck that can be mitigated, but the mechanics doesn't fit the theme, like a lot of euros, it really isn't a problem for me because I always expect that the theme wouldn't work fine with the mechanic, even the mechanic being good.

RATING: 6.7
An enjoyable, if somewhat fiddly, euro.  The subsystems are cleanly designed, and the variable boards and starting locations certainly keep the game relatively fresh and force the players to get used to playing on more than one clock (front runner with lots of small areas vs come from behind completer of large blocks) and with more than one subsystem (pastures close or far away, say).

My only concern is not so much about design but implementation: given fiddly art and pastel colours, I can't reliably see what's happening on other people's boards, so the dogging side of the game is less than it might be. Is that a chicken or a cow?  How many are there, anyway?  And what the heck do all of his knowledge buildings do?  Etc etc for the whole of the game.

Para mí el mejor juego del sr. Feld.
Muy buenas mecánicas, todas las acciones tienen sentido, la acción de los trabajadores para aumentar o disminuir la tirada de dados es, simplemente magnífica y disminuye el azar a "mínimos". Siempre tienes alguna acción que hacer. Nunca tienes la sensación de haber jugado un turno perdido.
Más conclusiones en la vídeo reseña que he dejado aquí en la "bgg".
Le pongo un 9 y no un 10 por los componentes, bastante "justitos", losetas finas, tablero de jugadores delgados... por contra buen tablero común.

A modern classic, I played it a bit later on my journey of board game discoveries and perhaps it had its "punch' and novelty flavor robbed of it, but its greatness is undeniable (like a person who is watching Pulp Fiction for the first time now), a lot  variability, fast (after you learn the buildings functions/bonus)and really good. perhaps the only thing it has going against it is the art which is a bit bland (unlike pulp fiction:)).  The wife loves it and I felt it worked equally well as a two player game. I Recommend.

RATING: 8
An excellent euro game that forces you to step up your optimization skills each time you play. The components look nice, if a bit dated but they certainly feel good too. It contains many balance fixes for differing numbers of players. Typically, however, first mover advantage isn't solved by simply adding another worker (ability to change a die face by +/- 1). As tiles get drafted, the players going last must settle for what's left. Ultimately, there are enough unique tiles that any player can attempt to make up the points with a long-run strategy. One downfall of the game would be the fighting over going first (or second in a 4-player game) as it does have such a significant advantage.

Interesting mechanics that make it an interesting puzzle.  Sometimes can be so many variable options that it can cause AP.

RATING: N/A
The game is set in the Burgundy region of High Medieval France. Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.

The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.

Feld has made a wonderful game that has none of the punishment factors that many of his other games have and is an excellent 2-3 player game. With 4 players it might drag a bit longer but with experience that factor is deminished and since all tiles are going to come up (unless you have the 2nd expansion included) you can plan your strategy better. The poor quality components is my only complaint.

Si estás empezando en los juegos de mesa y quieres dar un pasito más, Castillos de Borgoña puede ser el juego ideal. Pero no sólo engancha a los iniciados, los más jugones se rinden ante este juego de Feld. Una maravilla lúdica. Quizá los puntos negativos están en la poca interacción que hay entre jugadores (casi nula) y lo mal que escala (un rollo a 4 jugadores). A dos, perfecto.

2-4(2,3)

UPDATE: Yeah, it's a fun one. It's interesting, on account of every action feeling "small" and even redundant (many of the buildings do things you could do yourself ... though I guess with the benefit of filling your board) so it feels awfully slow-moving (likely why some thing it feels about 20 minutes too long), but there is that tangible progression. I'm enjoying this so far.

-------------------------------------------------------

You know, Stefan Feld gets a lot of crap for pasted-on themes and dry, soulless Euros, but I think he's a pretty clever designer. I'm a mechanics geek and each of his games pulls interesting mechanisms together in a fun way. I've never really been let down by his games: Notre Dame, Luna, Macao, and now Burgen. I was turned off when I played the PC version of In the Year of the Dragon, but now I'm tempted to see how it plays face-to-face.

dBvB is a clever game that limits your options with the dice, but has a very easy way to sort of manipulate things so that you can do what you want. There are a lot of things to remember (not building the same building in a "city" is a rule we missed, say) and it's hard to figure out the way to "win" but it's a great puzzle.

A game that might have been designed not to appeal to me: -

Boring medieval building theme - yep.

Player interaction - not completely eliminated; you can take a tile before someone else.  Whoopee.

Downtime - yawning with four players.

Repetition - pick up tiles, place them, pick up tiles, place them, pick up tiles...

Itty bits with tiny pictures - indeed, but at least they dispensed with icons.

Great euro game. The simple use of dice provides interesting choices for the players. Nice scoring system. As always Mr Feld tries to create tension by making players to compete with each other for the turn order, for the various tiles, for scoring regions and the special awards. Timing is crucial. I like seeing my kingdom expanding as turns go by.
My first 4 players game lasted about 3 hours but the game flows well and I never got bored. Eager to play again. I think that typical playtime will be around 2 hours. Minor issues: the theme is weak, feels like pasted-on. Typical Alea quality components. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Awesome game. Only real complaint is that it's a bit "multiplayer solitaire" for my tastes. The only real interactions are competing over when to take desirable tiles, and being first to certain majorities. Nonetheless, the intricate building of little combos and completing regions for points is very satisfying in a very visceral way. I can see why this game is highly regarded.

Like it, as long as the tendency for AP doesn't stretch it out too long. It's engrossing throughout, lots of different routes to victory to try. 

The components are a little hard to make out in dim light; there can be confusion over the shades of green, for example.

Rules particularly to note: i. You can't build the same building more than once in any given "town" (contiguous group of building spaces). ii. You can buy a tile for 2 silver *at most* once per turn.

I don't understand the hype on this game. It's a good game, medium, but not that good as people use to say. I usually like no/low luck games, but this one seems like "just another soulless euro" to me, with nothing that innovative to deserve its hype over other euros.

I rarely rate a game based upon [i]watching[/i] a play - actually this is a first - but after watching a four player game take about three hours, I can safely say that I have no desire to ever play this game myself.  Setting aside the length issue for a moment, this appears to be a game with minimal forward planning (which makes the length of the game I watched even more surprising).  You roll dice, you take the best things available to you [i]for that turn[/i], perhaps you score points, lather, rinse, repeat.

After discussing the game with a friend who was playing it, I was not surprised to learn that he felt exactly the same way about it...

Played twice now, but several months apart.  I felt a bit frustrated in the second game because the writing was on the wall about how things would end about halfway through, and I couldn't do anything about it - a lot depended on dice, and Lady Luck was not on my side.  The most frustrating part is that the game is quite long - at least 1.5-2 hours.  So that's about an hour waiting for my demise, and a bit too long to just play it again to see if things could go differently.

RATING: 7.5
An amazingly clever game of dice rolling and tile placement, that uses dice in some unique and interesting ways.

Across 5 rounds of 5 turns, players roll two dice.  The values of the dice determine the actions the players can make on that turn; collecting resources or planning buildings, placing them into their own landscape, acquiring workers and all manner of other options.  And there are options galore in this game - even though your two dice determine two actions, performing some of those actions allows you to chain further actions from them.

With so many potential options, the game does tend toward a moderate level of AP and because most of the resources are available to all, having someone take one of the resources you were after often means you have to revise your strategy on each turn, and the dice values can often constrict your actions.

Playing around 30 mins per player, I felt the game just slightly overstayed its welcome, but I can see the game becoming much quicker once you knew the nature of the pieces and with less than 4 players.

The only criticisms I have of the game is that the theme is meaningless, several of the colours are difficult to differentiate and some of the graphics are too small to be seen easily.  But these are minor concerns for a truly great game.

Overall, I found CoB to be an impressive combination of mechanisms, multiple options, manifold paths to victory and combined with a unique use of dice.  I thoroughly enjoyed the game and look forward to trying it with 2 players.

Quite possibly my most-loved game, though it has *the* flaw of Euros (fixed game length that means you're often spending the last few turns scrounging for small amounts of points after you've gotten your main strategy off).

One euro I don't get tired of. The game is fantastic.

It's a little hard to explain (since it has a lot of small rules) and the odds may play against you from time to time but it's easy to mitigate. 

It has a ton of replayability (even using the standard board) and, compared to other great euros, this one is quite cheap.

I'm still waiting for the 'heavy' dice game that I like as much as the lighter end of that genre - camouflaging the luck of the roll with a multitude of choices just doesn't seem to do it for me.

Fine, for sure. But way way overrated. Nowhere near Felds best, nor deserving of its status as a benchmark game in my opinion. Desperately in need of a design refresh and component upgrade. The mechanics are good and the game is smooth. Too bad it is so ugly.

A dice fest that manages to feel like a thoughtful euro, and that is quite an impressive design feat.  

Production design issues, readability of tiles issues, and "everything scores all the time, and thus, how and why did I win or not win?" issues, but the first play of this game manages to be highly entertaining for anyone who likes euros and building euro game engines.  

Not entirely sure if this will retain such a high score on future plays...

Great game. Very nice dice management. There is a lot to do throughout the whole game and, of course, you can't have it all. :) like a true euro ;) 

The game has a lot different ways to collect points. Also, very nice artwork (subtly beautiful ;)).

RATING: 6
Pretty good eurogame, but does not deserve the mantle of 11th best game of all time. The game is tactical but not particularly strategic, the individual systems within the game are cute but don't interlock elegantly, and I don't feel satisfied by getting points, since points are just a thing that happens in a constant flow and don't really feel like a reward for playing well. The game is definitely fun and satisfying as you fill your board, but I'm not quite sure what distinguishes it from all the other medieval economy games out there. The physical game components are also notoriously cheap and bland.

The more I play CoB, the less I like it. Every game feels like the same process without much variation. Same tiles, not much diversity of strategy. Downgraded from a 7 after 5 plays.

All plays were 2p games. I think this is a good game, but I'm not overly enthusiastic about it. All of our plays felt the same and I probably should try it with more people to give a better rating. 

Playing the game feels a bit tactical as making a suboptimal move only costs a couple of points or so, and such moves can be tolerated if you do not play the whole game suboptimally. This fact makes mistakes a lot more forgiving, which is not always a good thing. In terms of balance, I think the game is great and this is why I want to play it again and explore more.

2p Combinations So Far: 1-1, 2-4, 3-5, 6-8, 7-9, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 2-7, 1-4

Great game.  Seems like it's a turn too long (by which I mean one phase too long), and trying to remember/decipher the abilities for all the brown and yellow buildings is tough.  But lots of different strategies seem to be completely viable.

RATING: 5
Another game that's simple to learn and play. Complexity comes from the chains you can build with the tiles instead of through the rules. Setup, however, can be a real pain as you need to sort all 164 of the small hexes by the colour on their back. Having gone back and visited it after not playing for 2 years, I now find the game highly random and just plain dull. Just don't understand the appeal of this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Castles of Burgundy is Stefen Feld at his best. He once again takes the randomizing characteristics of 6-sided dice and turns them into something strategic. Each turn those dice rolls give you hard decisions to make. Take a building from the board, place said building or get workers to help you next turn. And while there is the chance you'll get shut out of what you really want you are never left without an option. It plays very easy. But the game can get a little long especially in the final rounds when your placement is so critical. If you are hesitant about buying your first Feld game we do not think you can go wrong starting with this one.

The roll of two dice determine what actions you can do. Strategically make plans and contingency plans based on your roll and what you see the other players roll. I like that each player can have their own board with the coloured hexes placed in different locations, giving each player slightly different building goals. Having dice determine your actions makes Castles of Burgundy play like Alien Frontiers, but shorter.  I would choose this over Alien Frontiers because it's way less complicated and shorter playing/learning time.

{4 plays • 3-4 players} I really like this one despite the fact that it seems to take forEVER to play it.  Seriously, our games went, like, three hours... but here's the thing: I always felt involved.  And yeah, we were learning the rules, should speed up with experience, blah blah blah... there's still 25 turns x number of players.  But again, for now, I don't care, because I really dig the game.  I can see how some bad rolls - especially late in the game - might totally put off the more strategic players out there, especially since the game does, in fact, have a nice amount of stratgey to it (long-term, even).  But it didn't bother me - even when I rolled, like, double 1's three times in a row near the end of a 3 hour game and was totally hosed because of it.  That says a lot about how good I think one is.

Great concept and will need to try it again.  The ability to modify die rolls minimizes luck.  This game could suffer tremendously from AP though, because the actions end up being very serial (if someone takes the one tile you want, you may have to re-plan both of your actions).

Eurogame de duración ajustada pero muy entretenido en su desarrollo de construir un feudo a partir de tiles aleatorias y tiradas de dados.

Estoy tan molesta con este juego. A mi me gustó mucho pero a AA, DB y PP les cargó. No lo entiendo ¿Como voy a estar tan equivocada junto con otros gamers? Si está en el 31 de BGG.
En fin, en mi opinión es un muy entretenido juego en el que en cada turno debes lanzar 2 dados y usar uno para cada acción (conseguir losetas, colocarlas en tu tablero, obtener trabajadores). A medida que desarrollas tu ciudad obtienes habilidades y PV....

Abril 2015 - 6.9
Nuevamente falló el juego en el grupo, y eso que ahora es el 11 de BGG. El principal problema es que toma demasiado tiempo. Si bien yo me entretuve todo el tiempo haciendo mi dominio, al parecer el resto del grupo lo encontró monótono. Tanta fé que le tenía, y al aprecer tendrá que irse de la ludoteca, snif....
Le bajé la nota por la longitud. Si fuese un poco más corto estaría dispuesta a jugarlo casi siempre...

Played this two player and it nicely fills the medium two player spot between really light card games and heavy war games.

Each round you roll dice and then have to figure out how best to spend them.  This prevents the game from getting too heavy with long term planning and analysis.  You certainly need to set some general short and long term goals, but you have to stay flexible.

I've had this game for over a year and never cracked it open. This last weekend it was my birthday so finally decided to remove the wrap, punch out the pieces and read the rules. What initially looked like a very complicated game ended up being very intuitive and after only a few games I have already ranked it as an all time favourite. I will see if it holds this rank after repeated plays but so far it ticks all my boxes for a brilliant game.

Excellent, well-designed game with multiple paths to victory, tons of options and strategy, and so much to think about yet not overly complex. 

The game does a good job of adding a little bit of randomness, but allowing players to control their luck by changing dice rolls with workers. Each game board gives players the challenging decisions of placing tiles to both complete regions for points and open up options for future building. The game is balanced with all tiles having some sort of benefit.

RATING: 5
For openers: does that box really say 30-90 minutes?  Hell of a range.  And given that there are 25 turns, you get a whopping 1.2 minutes per turn to hit the low end.  Only play was 4P.  Fairly simple core, with highly lookup-intensive and language-neutral (the two are often correlated...) exceptions via special abilities.  Felt to me like a base Euro to which someone just kept adding, adding, and adding.  Experienced lots of uninteresting downtime, strongly inclined to guess that this is better with each fewer player.  Not the kinda thing I'd bring out even for two, though I thought it was fine and functional.  Future plays yielded more of the same.  Boring Euro IMO.

Underrated this at first as initial plays were with non-gamers.
Also just seems to work better when everyone has a different mat from the start, even for an intro game.
Playing with everyone on the same intro mat feels to actually penalize new players and those later in the turn order more, as there is more often a "best" tile for everyone at the same time.
Versus when you make the hard decisions to cost someone else lots of points versus managing your own empire, it just seems to work better.
Very much more tactical with two.

Dice games fall into the love 'em or hate 'em category all to easily.  Most of the time the hate comes from the feeling that the dice are (or the player is) cursed.  CoB avoids this very well.  Each turn's die results can be applied in many different ways and one key to playing this well seems to be positioning yourself for future turns to take advantage of whatever the die falls.  And it turns out that it is quite possible to plan for this too.  Which makes the game quite enjoyable.  It has very limited player interaction (mostly limited to interfering with tile drafts) - but the interaction can have a profound impact on an opponent's scoring.  You can try to ignore your opponents actions and you will find that doing so makes winning harder.  So while the interaction is subtle, it is important.  This game is also a great one for a casual game event.  You can talk / socialize with the other players while playing this one and still enjoy the game.  One of the best dice placement / tile-laying / set collection... Feld soup games out there.  Definitely a good game.

A bit of an oldie these days, but a goodie. A great strategy game that gets your noggin working. Definitely recommended if you want to add a little weight to your collection, but don't want to scare newcomers with too much complexity. Does come with quite a few punchout cards. My copy came with both an English & French rulebook. Gameplay flows well, once everyone at the table is familiar with the rules. Some may find it boring, as it doesn't draw theme to it's forefront. The goal is to roll dice and choose your actions wisely or rather make the best out of what the game gives you to score the most points. 7.5/10 just because Euros aren't my strongest mechanic.

I want to like this.  But I think I'm done with it, though maybe only with four players.  downtime is long, and next-to-useless for planning, or even involvement.

Feld is clever. There is no doubt about that here. He makes dice actually great, by making their results the inputs into your decision-making rather than determining the effectiveness of decision outputs.

There is little more satisfying in games than kicking off a combo of tiles that lets you get and lay down four tiles or so.

The game's largest flaw, as with many Feld games, is that it feels like it should end about 20% sooner. I think I'll try removing one round from each phase some time.

Initial thoughts on this game are that it's good, but not completely positive. I had the impression a bit that the game mostly played itself. I strongly hope and suspect that that means that long term strategy is going to be on the subtle side, so I'm refraining from rating for now until I get a better feel for that.

It's hard to distinguish several of the colors in the game when the light isn't optimal; particularly orange/pink goods, and grey mines/brown city buildings.

While this game is little more than a point-salad, it has  immense replayability, tons of meaningful decisions, a healthy amount of tension, and scales incredibly well for 2-4 players. Each turn feels like a different tactical puzzle where players must find the best way to earn VP. And if players are observant, they will soon realize that this game isn't a solitaire experience as blocking/stealing tiles is a substantial threat. Overall, I really enjoy this game.

Is it perfect? Mechanically, it's difficult to fault this game. There is randomness but the dice serve more to focus players than mitigate their decisions; players often have numerous things to do and can modify dice-rolls easily. But component wise, there is more to be desired; The chits/mats are thin and the tokens would benefit from being more distinguishable. Simply put, this game deserves a deluxe edition.

Somewhere in the land between 6 and 7. I think its a pretty good game but I find myself not want to play it very often. 

I think its kind of a dog to setup and get going. Also I really like Kingsburg which scratches the same itch.

RATING: 6
An deceipfuly excellent game. The rules are very, very easy, and it looks as if will be a luck fest at first sight, but thje more I play it, the more I grasp its subtle ways to make deep decisions with few choices, just like the other games I love from Feld.

UPDATE: The very definition of "point salad", which can be both good or bad (or a mix). Still a very solid design, but no longer one I feel I always want to play. Down to a 7.5.

UPDATE: This is a game that has slowly faded out of my "interest" zone. I'd play it, but I don't enjoy it as often. It feels more like work than a game, and the lack of theme just doesn't help its cause.

I really enjoy Stefan Feld's games, but this one felt so much like it was a prototype that never was completed, from the artwork and the lack of theme to the difficulty of translating the iconography to something meaningful and the lack of depth and action refinement, that I can not give this anything better than a 3.1.  I would be hard pressed to be play this again as I would prefer to read and review games rules over this tedious and repetitive time waste.

Original comments:  A game that starts promisingly, but as you proceed there is less and less you can or want to do - except finish the game!  The opposite to the positive feeling you get when you build up a position in a game.  As with Macao, a lot of different cards/tiles to remember.  Should have been a game of four rounds, not five.

Bur now revisited and appreciate the design a lot more.  Nice combos and planning opportunities.  Still a round too long but see that this is necessary to allow players to fulfil objectives.  Rating increased (by an unprecedented 2 points - but then it is four years later) 6.5 to 8.5.

The theme is so so... but the mechanics really work, the diferent kind of buildings, the buying and selling goods, the workers, really has all the things envolved and plays very fast. with only 2 dice setting the options it really speeds the game up.
Once again with a stephen feld game forget the theme.
Recomended.

RATING: 8
Ötletes játék, az általam eddig próbált Feld játékok közül dobogós (a Macao és a Notre Dame tetszett jobban, a Dragon year és a Luna kevésbé).
Nagyon jól kiegyensúlyozott(nak tűnik elsőre), minimális volt a különbség a végén. Haszontalan lépést akarva se nagyon lehet tenni a játékban, általában jó és még jobb lehetőségek közül lehet választani, a szokásostól kicsit eltérő kockamódosító mechanizmus (+-1) tág mozgásteret enged. A vége felé (ahogy fogynak a területek, és sürget az idő), felértékelődhet a kockadobás, és ezen keresztül a szerencse szerepe (de ez megelőzhető).
Összességében jó játék, és még szép is. Máskor is jöhet:)
---
Másodjára is nagyon kevésen múlt a játék, pedig 200 pont felett végzett mindenki, de 3 ponton belül volt az első és az utolsó (3 fős)!!! Mindenkinek más pályája volt, ennek ellenére is kiegyensúlyozottnak éreztem. Emellett számomra nagyon felértékeli a sok féle pálya a játékot.
---
Átpontoztam a Feldeket, csak 3 db 8 pontost hagytam: Burgund, Dragon, Notre Dame. A Burgundba nem nagyon tudok belekötni, de a másik kettő az, amivel legszívesebben játszom.

A typical Feldian game ... A great idea with eight layers of scoring crap piled on. If you like his games, you'll like this one, too.

A solid game that feels like creative puzzle-building. The Castles of Burgundy plays well with the right group, but lack of theme and player interaction will keep this one away from my groups table. 

There's a nice balance of thought and luck that make decision making simple but deep. I do hope to have more opportunities to play this one.

UPDATE: This one only gets better with time. Finally got my group to play it, and it's slowly becoming a regular on the table. There is always plenty to do, and the amount of agency completely obscures the lack of theme. This one's getting a bump. Final score: 9

After 2 plays, I confess to being underwhelmed; by 4-5, I was intrigued; by 8-9, totally hooked. I adore this game!
It's a kind of delumptious torture, where you know perfection (filling 36 hexes) is impossible but nevertheless entices you to want to try and try again to better your previous. 
I know some, whilst loving CoB, are put off by the quality/colour of the tiles and yearn for a deluxe edition upgrade. I for one are not one of them. I actually like the game as is; it kinda has its own daggy charm. For me, it's perfect!
A great game.

RATING: 8
The main idea is quite interesting and good fun.  It is an impressive optimization exercise, and unlike many other Feld's games, whatever you do it is always something good.  There is no punishment in this game!  But I found my only 4-players game a bit too long, and on the components side, they could have been better (especially the player mats).  It is not easy to get what every building or bonus tile do, and pieces are quite small, so you really need some training to get used to icons and make the game more fluent.

This is probably the most characteristic Feld game. It seems like a "review", a "summary" of some of his recent games.

Stefan Feld is slowly finding a little place among my favorite designers. The last three Feld designs I tried intrigued me (In the Year of the Dragon, Luna and Burgen) at the very least.
This game has two immediately visible drawbacks: it has a very thin theme, and a quite terrible artwork (the components are way too small, and the colors are too "beige"! I must admit, anyway, that the graphic design is very functional). These two factors kept it away from the table for a long time before its inaugural cruise.
The gameplay, however, is fast (the idea of keeping the number or dice - and therefore actions - low is the decisive factor here), there is space for combos and specialization, and everything clicks quickly and in a very logical way.

One of my favorite Feld designs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is a LOT of fun. I enjoy Puerto Rico but my wife doesn't like to play. This game, she likes. It has a much higher "fun" factor (I'm not sure why). In my limited experience this is my favorite Euro so far. I'll play every chance I get.

UPDATE: Dropped from a 9 to an 8 after 6 plays. The game is still very fun but the set up takes forever because of all the little cardboard pieces. If the game were easier to set up I would play it more and like it more but right now the hassle factor has lowered our desire to play it as often.

RATING: 10
This is my wife's favourite game and I love it too. Perfectly balanced 2 player that should be in every gamers collection.

It's just got a really lovely flow to it. Thinky but not too thinky, if that makes sense...

There is an overall sense of strategy without you being bound to it, and you tend to play tactics on the fly and from a gut instinct (much like Concordia) which means you never approach the game with the same old tried and tested moves, which is great for replayability.

I don't enjoy this as much as Notre Dame by the same designer. Design itself is OK, lots of different ways to score points but it is overly long with more than 2 players which I don't think works for me. These types of games I prefer to play in a group and since I can play Puerto Rico or Agricola in the same time this isn't going to get a look in. Also the board itself is incredibly bland, it's not easy to see what is what at a distance.

Best dice euro I've played, better than Kingsburg..way better. You can actually see your kingdom grow and dice manipulation is a lot better. However, theme-wise it doesn't really make sense, so not very intuitive for new players. You always have something to do and everything gives you points, so it just ends up being a race to get the most points, but it's surprisingly fun.

5/12 - Absolutely outstanding game. I love the Worker Tiles that allow you to change your dice results and I really enjoy the feel of the game.

7/14 - I've played this masterpiece 39 times now. The couple of expansions we have add more variety to the game but honestly, even without those, this game is phenomenal. It plays in 45 minutes with 2, which is slightly longer than Trajan, but it found the perfect blend of fun and strategy.

I'm not a fan of using an action to take workers.  I don't mind mitigating a few rolls, but the fun factor takes a hit when one or more players repeatedly get hosed by the dice.  I prefer sessions in which the mitigating knowledge tiles appear in Phases A-B.

I much prefer Macao and Luna.  However, Castles of Bugundy is growing on me.  It still feels too long for what it is, but I do enjoy most aspects of the game.  The variety of player boards is a plus.

Eerste kennismaking: vrij complexe regels en spelbord.
Beginnen spelen, en wel meteen leuk en vanzelfsprekend: elementen van Puerto Rico, maar toch heel verschillend en in feite meer keuzemogelijkheden.

Hoe gaat het spel?
Men dobbelt en met deze ogen kan men fiches pakken van het bord en/of deze fiches bouwen in zijn hof.
Gebouwen, boten, speciale fiches.  Men kan ook grondstoffen verkopen om geld te krijgen.
Anderzijds zijn er ook de "mannekes" waarmee men zijn ogen van de dobbelsteen kan veranderen.

Tentative rating after one play - I usually like Stefan Feld games.  This was cute and fairly easy to learn.  It ran a little too long, though...and we only had 3 players.  I would play again, but I wouldn't be the one suggesting it.  And I definitely won't buy it.

*edit* - Okay I did suggest it today, but I still wasn't terribly excited about playing.  Still ran long, despite having only one new player in a 4-player game. 

**edit-edit** - Like a fungus, this game has grown on me, and I like it even more when AP-ness isn't involved (if y'know what I mean, ;) ;) ).

I found there were too many choices to make that you couldn't really think about up until your turn started, so AP was a huge problem here. Add to that the weird disconnection between theme and mechanisms and the lack of player interaction and you'll get something that's definitely not my cup of tea.

This is probably my first euro game, and it's an excellent game. Theme is paste-on, artwork is mediocre, component is functional although nothing outstanding but comes in a very affordable price point. The game itself is very solid, all those other details doesn't detract from the gameplay experience at all. When you're playing the game, you won't care about all the flaws I've mentioned cause the game is just THAT good. Clever usage of dice, minimal luck and there's something to do every turn that you'll be torn with choices. Point salad game with multiple pathway to victory, game always end in a tense finish.

RATING: 6
First Play: seduced into a game before I saw the cubes of death in person and their nasty little pictures printed all over the player board. To be honest, given a choice I wouldn't have started. However, this is not so bad as far as most dice games go. Yes the tendancy for the dots to fail to match your prefered moves and locations, time and time again, is bloody annoying. OK that can be mitigated by using workers to nudge the numbers in the right direction. I took the yellow tile that make a worker worth 2 for this purpose but it still wasn't enough. I seemed to be cashing in a die for workers every other go. That pissed me off for a start.

My next issue is the randomness of the tile distribution. Again you can get caught cold when turn order puts you at the back of the pack. It seemed no coincidence that the eventual winner and second place both scooped three mines each before the rest of us got one. That gets the cash machine rolling and you are on the back foot trying to get those central tiles if you are left out.

Because preceeding players will most certainly pinch your prefered turn there seems little point tring to plan ahead. There does seem to be a fair bit of down time.

The mechanism is quite clever but the chaos turns me off wanting to play this again. I certainly wouldn't buy it.

An elegant game of building up your village(?) by competing over tiles to add to your player board. Even though you roll some dice that dictate your options, there's always something you can do to further your progress. There's a slight learning curve regarding what buildings do and how things interact but overall the rules are pretty easy to grasp. The board/graphic design is a bit "bleh" with all the muted colors but that doesn't bother me too much. There's not much to fault about this game. This, like it's box-kin Puerto Rico, is a game I don't get super excited about but I can see playing sporadically for years to come as it does what it sets to do extremely well.

There's a reason TCoB is so highly rated on BGG. Fantastic game. Because die rolls dictate actions available to you, the game doesn't suffer from a heavy dose of AP like in many Euros. Once you begin to grasp the tile bonuses, this game moves fairly quickly. Set up is a bit of a chore, and I'm not a fan of the paper thin player boards or the small tiles. Still, it has found a home in my collection.

Wow!!!! How did I own COB for this long and not played it? That was a crime. This game rocks on so many levels. There are ways to manipulate your dice, so you are never completely locked in based on your roll. There are many different, viable strategies (ships, animals, etc.), it is easy to teach to new players. The list goes on and on. One of my top Euros ever. Get this!!!

Trajan is better.  I have played lots and lots of worker placements, and Castles of Burgundy just wasn't enjoyable to me.

Castles of Burgundy is good fun but I'm not entirely sold on it yet, since I am still learning the nuances. So, I could be wrong on this but, the game feels too static. Almost any tile can be bought at almost any time, and most tiles have only instantaneous effects, so I didn't get that sense of growing from a tiny fiefdom into a kingdom of power and wealth. I would greatly prefer if there were costs and prerequisites that limited buying power in the early game and that affected choices later on for more strategic play and a sense of an unfolding story. As it is, the various board layouts don't do enough to offer a decent arc.

Not sure it warrants its position on the rankings, but CoB is a great game.

It's rare that my girlfriend and I don't finish a game... but this was boring beyond belief. 
Super slow, every few actions you have to "refresh" the main board, etc. It's fiddly and it's annoying (and I don't mind the fiddliness when the game is good --> e.g., roads and boats).

And the components are sub-par to say the least (note: I also own Puerto Rico and Glen More and didn't mind as much)

Another game by Stefan Feld that uses dice in a rather interesting way. While being a bit less abstract than the dud Macao the theme is rather unoriginal to say the least. Still, building a city is always fun and managing how to expand yours to profit the most from the special actions makes for interesting decisions. The game is all about timing and a bit of luck. It's not very deep and there is almost no player interaction, but it's still an enjoyable medium level eurogame.

Great game that is gonna go down in history as a true classic I feel. A dry eurogame that has very broad appeal. The randomness in setup and numerous player boards makes for very good replayability.

I have played this mostly with 2 players, but also a few times with 3 and 4. It is good with all, but best with 2, IMO. With two denial becomes more viable and you actually care about what the other player does, while with 3 or 4 it becomes more solitaire-ish and downtime increases significantly.

We're really enjoying this one right now.  It's definitely a Euro, so if that makes you yawn, then stay away.  Game play is a bit dry, but you get plenty of mental gymnastics in during play.  Variable player boards add to the fun.  Setup is a little tedious with what feels like several hundred chits to shuffle and pile up, but after that it's a cake walk.  Our first play was slow as we were getting used to the system of play, and of course playing a few rules wrong.  Today we played game #2 which went much faster and was very enjoyable.  This will be a staple in my collection for some time to come.

I enjoyed this as I usually enjoy Feld games.  There are a lot of little pieces working together and enough flexibility for players to do what they want to do, but I'm not sure that long term replay-ability will be great.

After the second play, I think replay-ability might actually be there.  However, I've realized that it really just is a big game of maximizing in the moment.  I thought my wife would enjoy this game and she liked it okay in the first play, liking it more in the second play for her.

I don't dislike CoB, but the more I play it the less I like it.  I've traded away my copy and then tried it again a year later and it was okay but not good enough.  I'm probably done with this game.

The first ever game to reappear in my collection by my purchase after I got rid of it... a used copy in excellent condition was available at a reasonable price. I'm looking forward to playing it again.

My rating for this game has gone from 8 to 6 to 8 and now I've put it at a 7. That feels like where it belongs. It's not a great game, but pretty good. I'll keep it and probably play it once or twice per year.

Burgen von Burgund is one of those perfectly balanced eurogames where everything works smooth and fine: like any of those though it utterly lacks warmth, setting, atmosphere. The theme itself here is simply stuck on, a nice packaging added later on to a perfectly tuned engine: as far as the theme goes indeed, Burgen of Burgund could have been about anything, for even as an abstract its gameplay and feeling wouldn’t have changed a bit.

I’m not saying I don’t like Burgen von Burgund, for it can be a very enjoyable game for a change: what I’m arguing is it isn’t able to reach the heart of the players and drive them to plunge into the game, growing oblivious of what’s happening beyond their gaming table like many other deeply-themed games do instead.

Really interesting take on dice worker placement.  I like how in a 2 - 3p game not every tile will come out.  I also think the variety from the different player boards is neat.

By far the best strategy game out there with so much replayability I always vote to play this game with my friends. I was hooked the day I was introduced to this and with so many player game boards, technology tiles and randomness this game is different every time. If you’ve never played it, get it now. At such a low price for a big game this is a winner every time and deserves a much higher ranking. You won’t be dissappointed!

The Castles of Burgundy was a "favorite game" of mine which is weird considering there came a point, rather quickly, that I no longer wanted to actually play it in person.  Since, I've logged >200 plays on various online implementations and, although I will still play it, I no longer "like" it.  That is to say, once as I started playing people who were "good" at CoB, I realized I had no interest in figuring out the [i]why[/i] of what makes them good.  That says two things, I guess, what kind of game this is and what kind of gamer I am.

RATING: 8
Another Feld masterpiece.  I expect my rating to go up.  Unlike other Feld games, it does not have any punishment/penalities if you don't do something.  But, it has a ton going on and what seems to me on first play a multitide of ways to go about earning points.  Timing is important in this one, as well.  Another great Alea game.  

I'm not sure what it feels like.  Turn order reminds me of Macao/ItYotD.  Taking tiles is like Notre Dame (and El Grande) where you take tiles into storage and then deploy onto the board with an action.  Some tiles have a variety of in game and end game bonuses which reminds me of the cards in Macao.  And it all is driven by using dice for action selection and for placement on the board.  But, it's not lucky dice as long as you have workers to adjust your dice (like Kingsburg).  

But, the game feels unique and really struck a chord with me.  It played very well with two.  I learned straight from the rule book and I felt we got through it without mistake.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I will admit I am not much of a Feld fan; about the only two games he has made that even potentially interest me are Trajan, which I have yet to play, and Castle of Burgundy, which I would call a Feld game for people who don't necessarily like Feld games (and also for people who do).

What gives Castles an edge is the way that the dice you roll, plus the location of where particular tiles are dealt in the board, gives enough variability to make action selection a genuine choice, rather than a scripted affair where you never have to deviate from your chosen strategy. Variable maps provide additional levels of specialization and keep the game fresh. It does still have the point salad feel, but there are big payoffs for staying focused on one or two areas. I traded away my copy as part of an offer I couldn't refuse, but I wouldn't mind reacquiring it somewhere down the line.

The only other Feld game I can recommend.  Yeah it seems a bit overwrought like all of his games with far too many ways to score points.  It's like he is emulating Knizia, but has none of the genius.  Anyways, here it remains remarkably coherent for Feld and there is a bit of indirect player interaction.  It also has the fun of building your own little fiefdom going for it.

A slightly more complicated game simply because of the amount of things you can do, but the decisions you make are simplified to spending actions based on dice you role which both limits you really well but has enough flexibility to never feel unproductive. 

Lots of components and rules can feel overwhelming, but mechanics in the game do a good job limiting what you need to focus on and decide at any given time

Good game at the border between family games and gamer's games. Just like Troyes, this is not a "roll the dice, do random stuff" affair, but a very tactical and interesting game. The different starting landscapes for each player improve replay value and force you to do different things each time you play. Could have used a little more player interaction and less ways of scoring. The multitude of small parts is a little annoying.

What an awesome game. So much to think about with two dice to place. Can be fiddly in set up with all the tiles but well worth the effort. There is something quite satisfying in dice drafting tiles and then seeing the number on the dice working out perfectly for a plan you have.

// This is a solid game. I'm kind of surprised how much I 
like it given how dry and themeless it is. The game works
well with two players (but could scale a bit better with 
four--it just takes too long) and is one of the better
dice rolling games where you don't feel too restricted by
your rolls since there are always options available to you
(some better than others).

Great beginner (non gamer) friendly game. This game offers that relaxing gameplay by the fire place with your wife/gf and a sleeping dog on your lap. There's not much direct competitiveness as long as you don't intentionally steal the resources that your opponent needs. Sometimes it does fell a bit dry but its smooth play and great mechanics more than compensate for it. All in all I def recommend this game to anyone and as a MUST for a game collection.

It's probably Feld's best game. It's definitely my favorite of his games I've played. I love rolling the dice and using them to take my actions. The dice are used to determine what spots you can access so low and high numbers are equally valuable. There are several different ways to chain actions together and score points. The components and art are not high quality, but the gameplay overcomes it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An enjoyable but repetitive game of set collection.  It has a novel mechanic for 6-sided dice.  You use your die rolls (2d6) to collect tiles and/or place tiles, then repeat (again and again).  Large sets generally get more points.  After a second play, I think there's too much luck of the dice (and tiles for each round) for a game of this length that "wants" to be a fairly meaty strategy game.  The many small decisions tend to increase down-time between turns and ultimately the winner seems to be the person who got better dice rolls to take advantage of opportunities in tiles/majority positions.  Sure, there are dice modifiers, but if you have to use them every turn to fix your bad dice to try to slow down the leader(s), you're gonna lose.

Very tactical for a Euro and I don't like the color scheme, but it's not as bad as most make it seem to be.  The gameplay has some randomness but you can mitigate that a bit.  Involves a spatial element which I enjoy.  The game is won and lost all in timing when to take tiles before your opponents and it's a race to complete certain districts.  Nice game, but doesn't blow me away.

Played this tonight. I liked the mechanics, but the game just went on too long and I somewhat lost interest about halfway through. There are a lot of good ideas in the design of it though. Update: bumping my score from 6 to 7. I played again tonight and definitely enjoyed it. I still think it goes on too long, but maybe only by one round. Someone else we were playing with I could tell did not like how long it went on. Maybe I just liked it more because I won. If you play this, make sure it comes out early in the night, as it goes on a while and is a little bit of a brain burner. I'd still take Alien Frontiers or Tzolkin over this, as far as fun factor. (update better than Alien Frontiers for sure, but I have played it so much that I sort of avoid it now)

Themeless game.   But that isn't an issue because the mechanics are ultra smooth and the strategy is interesting.   I find this to be an excellent non-solitaire style Euro.  I find I am constantly paying attention to my opponents for a couple of reasons.  Watching what strategy they might be going for,  watching for any future moves that might impact your strategy, looking for blocks,  mathing out how many tiles of a particular type are available, and who might be getting them in what order.

Terrific game that I enjoy every time it comes to the table.

Castles of Burgundy is a game that has grown on me quite a bit as we have played it.  It offers a medium depth, 90-120 minute experience that scales well from 2-4 players.  It takes a game or two to get familiar with all the tiles, but is fairly streamlined once you understand what everything does.  

The heart of CoB is that you acquire tiles from a common offer, and play them onto your personal board for points.  There are 25 turns, in 5 rounds of 5 turns each, with the tile offer refreshing after each round of 5 turns.  Every turn, players roll 2 dice, and each die allows an action which is constrained by the value on the die.  Generally, players can use a die to take a tile from the common offer and put it in their storage, to play a tile from storage to their board, to sell goods, or to take 2 workers, which allow modification of die values.  All of the tiles offer some kind of ability that activates when they are played to the board - everything from VPs to extra moves, to changing turn order.  The net result is that the dice constrain one's choices some, but there are many combos that can be pulled off as well.  The game asks the players to correctly value the tiles on offer and prioritize them, taking into account what everyone else needs, while maintaining flexibility to work with whatever the dice give.  

This is a favorite of my wife's, and has been well received by the two sets of friends we play games with most often.  It is interesting, and reasonably intuitive after the first round or so.  It offers a nice amount of depth and decisions, while keeping each turn brief to minimize downtime.  CoB is an excellent game, and one that has the right accessibility and depth to warrant a place in just about every collection.

Has quickly become my favorite Feld game. In my second play I managed a couple of good knowledges (two placement adjusts) as well as a pig monopoly, thus I really felt like I had the game firing on all cylinders.

The second best alea game by Stefan Feld, right behind Notre Dame, IMHO. 
I generally like original uses of dice in strategy games. Although this dice mechanism one might be a little less innovative than Macao's, I actually like BvB better, as I did not like the rather long turns at the end of Macao, the lacking overview of the opponents cards and the fact, that you do have to learn quite a lot of cards to play successfully.
BvB has however can become kind of multiplayer solitaire and seems to deliver the same gaming experience with any number of players (haven't played 2p). Therefore, it runs a little long for what it delivers with 4, but might be an excellent 2p game.

I got this for an out-of-pocket total of $9 on 2016 Amazon Prime Day! I am excited to have a Feld game and also I think I will genuinely enjoy playing this.

Update: I have played by myself 2 player and with real people 3 player. I really enjoy this game! I'll admit the componants themselves could be a bit nicer and if they ever re-print I will likely buy it but the game is fantastic. 

I'm thinking of buying different colored dice (pink and purple!) so the player colors aren't quite so ugly. Sheesh. 

Played with 4 players. There are a lot more tiles being taken in a 4 player game! I came in last place but I still enjoy the game.

First impression, this score may go up on subsequent plays. It went long for our first game, but was very engaging gameplay with the options to manipulate the dice for action selection. I never felt I was hampered by dice rolls except for a few times that I could not make an optimal decision, and took workers instead. Still, with well over 50 actions available over the entire game, there are plenty of meaningful choices. I like the variable play with boards and random tile set up for each turn, and each game. Excellent use of this dice mechanic. UPDATE: Score has gone up to a solid 10 - exploiting the scoring opportunities to the maximum extent is quite fulfilling, even if you don't win.
Own the New Player Boards, 4th Expansion Player boards, and 2nd Expansion tile pieces.

I don't know what it is about Castles of Burgundy that makes it so much fun to play. This is a game that is more than the sum of its parts

I like the multitude of options. It always feels like I have something productive I can do on my turn, even if it is just taking workers to make a future turn better.

I like the spatial element a lot.

I like how rolling dice means I don't need to stress too much about planning multiple turns in advance and can be a little more adaptive to my rolls.

That being said, so far I have only played it two player and sometimes get frustrated by the downtime. I would maybe play with 3 and would have to be convinced to even try playing with more.

A very well balanced euro. One of the best I've played. After playing Troyes (another dice management game which I did not like), I was wary of these mechanics. This game, however, totally sold the mechanic for me. I learned the game with some friends in NM, picked up the game in an auction, and now my wife and I have really enjoyed every play. The game scales very well whether for 2 or 3 or 4 players. Kudos to the game's designers.

Perfect game for 2 players. A lot of replay ability, strategic thinking and planing.  I love this game, but with more than 2 players my friends tend to get distracted away from it so i rather play something else. Maybe with more plays this may change. The setup of every round drags a bit, but nothing terrible and it is necessary for such a great game.

I have been playing this online at Yucata.  Very tight design with enough variability to keep me playing.  Works very well online as very well suited to asynch play.  To some extent it is multiplayer solo (interaction between players is to take a tile someone else wants more), so you can play your turn and come back later for you next turn.  Decisions are mostly tactical rather than long term strategy - which means you can juggle multiple online games at once.

Another interesting dice game, but ultimately I think DBvB is inferior to Troyes. Less interaction and more AP-prone. Components do not help either: bad color choices and cheap materials. I like most of Feld's games, but do not feel the need to own any of them.

First play was very entertaining. My wife beat me by 50 points, which makes want to play again really soon. Our recent plays have been Glen More and Alien Frontiers. This game seems like a cross between those two. It has a fascinating blend of mechanics, and great replay potential with the varied boards. After four plays, I still have not won. Maybe it is not my best game. Ok, after six plays I have now won twice. Games are getting closer. The tension in the expansion boards is terrific. Feels like a completely new game.

Another good follow up from Stephan Feld. More innovative things to do with dice. A bit multi-player solitaire. There isn't a story arc but there seems to be good multiple paths.

Interesting and very well balanced eurogame with solid dice mechanics included. Probably best with 3 when the playing time is still reasonable (and if players are not prone to AP). Components are as awful as you would expect from a Alea game but don't let it bother you.

Suffers from the 'Americanization' of Euro games. Way too many little chits everywhere. Far too long. Takes forever to set up. Playing this for the first time, the same day as playing Knizia's Taj Mahal for the first time, really crystallized for me what's wrong with recent Euros - they add tons of complexity for no increase in decisions. I'll take something from the 'golden age' of Euros (1998-2003) over this any day.

I do like the die mechanism, and how you can pay to change the results. Would be nice if that were incorporated into a game that doesn't creak under its own weight.

An excellent use of dice and tiles. Because of the many options, and the workers - doesn't even really feel like a dice game at all.
Tiles could have been a little thicker - but nice components otherwise.

I like how dice values in this game don't matter as numbers. They just indicate actions that you can do, but 6 isn't better than 1. For a game with a high amount of randomness and luck it's still quite entertaining.

Another great thing about it is that once you've played it a few times a game can be played very quickly. I will have to try it as a two player game too.

*All Plays Recorded*

First Impression: 

A good solid game. I see why people compare this to Macao, but to me it feels totally different. The long term planning aspect is significantly less and less connected than Macao. Also, Macao just feels so much more satisfying and epic. Macao also looks better. Also, Die Burgen doesn't feel as innovative. Overall a solid game, but of Feld's three games that I own, this is the one that I am least excited to play again.

*note*

I think high expectations played into my initial rating and impressions. Now that those expectations are lowered it will be interesting to see how I enjoy/rate this game after a couple plays.

*note*

I have now played CoB 10 times and I have to say my enjoyment has gone up with more experience. Now that I feel have a better understanding of how the game works I enjoy it quite a bit more. Still not as good or innovative as Macao, but still a really good game that is going up in my opinion. Has a chance to climb into my top 10 and may even earn a rating of 9 after some more plays. Also, my wife loves it(her fave game) which is also a bonus.

RATING: 7
Very impressed after one play.  Inspired, intricate game design.  Lots of moving parts, which seem overwhelming at first, but are fairly intuitive after a few minutes.  The choices range from a cornucopia at the beginning of each turn to doing the best you can with what little is left by the end.

Lacks that typical "Woe is me" feeling of many Felds, but certainly has plenty of long-term vs. short-term decisions.  I like how dice are used to narrow the choices to a manageable number, but the limitations can be mitigated by the choices made earlier.  (I was fortunate in my first game to go into the last turn with the ability to almost ignore the dice if needed, but I still found myself on the last two phases meticulously counting my resources to be sure I could pull off what I wanted to do.)

I can't help wondering how this game was birthed in Feld's mind.  What thoughts led to such an intricate interweaving of ideas and mechanisms?  A second play may bring me down to Earth, but right now, I'm very impressed.

Best with 2-3.

After one game. Great Feld game. Possibly better than Macao? More plays will tell the tale. After my second game, I still feel this is a great game, but I think Macao may be the better game. 

Update after 4 games. Definitely not a Macao killer for me. I think Macao is the better game with it's long term strategy and engine building mechanics. CoB is an enjoyable lighter alterntive to Macao for me, but Macao will remain my favorite Feld game...for now. 

8 Plays: A couple strategies seem to dominate, but I still enjoy it.

11 Plays: The advanced boards eliminate the dominant strategy problem, but introduce a balance issue as some boards are clearly superior.

26 Plays: The issue about unbalanced boards is mostly a non-issue (board #8 not withstanding). Played our first 3er with the Speilbox boards. Michelle scored 226 after almost being locked out of an all important castle in round 4. 

31 Plays: Not a fan of the new restrictive rules that came with the Spielbox boards. You can get hosed pretty badly and end up spinning tires for whole rounds for lack of a castle or space you can legally play in. We use the new boards but with the original rules. 

37 Plays: Pretty much done with CoB. Still, it had a good run!

This is the Alea big boxer that gets all the love around our house.  Why?  Because Rachelle likes it so much!  And I must admit, it is one smooth daddy.  Easy to play, puzzley, tactical, and plenty immersive, it's perhaps the ideal medium-light Euro.  Why the less than stellar rating, then?  Well, smooth as this one goes down, the flavor is quite the same.  Strategies are pretty much dictated by your player board and the combo of tiles that come out.  Thank god for the many player boards included with the game, they help with variety.  And I'd highly recommend picking up the bonus boards published in Spielbox, they make the game tougher and add variety.  Even so, this one feels samey.  Chocolate is samey too, though, and I always want to eat it.  This is one yummy game.

I'm sure there's so much untapped strategic potential in this game that I'm just not seeing, but it's just a solid 'okay' for me at this point. The game takes a fair bit of time for how light it is, is pretty repetitive and doesn't grip me in much the same way that other games do.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Finally! A Euro that is both challenging and competitive, but light enough to play with non-gamers and can be learned in about 10 minutes. I love how the dice shape the way you play the game without necessarily limiting your choices. 

The game is always tense as important hexes get snatched up, but is not very confrontational because you have your own board and can't directly attack other people. I can see how a four-player game would get tediously long, but with two players it is perfect.

Very tactical game. Not sure I like it. Hard to plan more than a turn in the future, as dice dictate your available actions, although this can be mitigated by use of die roll modifier tokens you can buy instead of picking up stuff for VPs. Icons on the hex counters need to be explained, but not a problem after a few rounds. Game can tend to be a problem with AP, as you need to react to changing game conditions every turn (and round).

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Great medium-weight tile-drafting strategy point-salad game with many paths to victory.
++ I like the fact that you only have two actions (dice) per turn with a limited choice of 4 different actions to do with these dice. This keep the focus to optimizing your turn.
++ I love the fact that even if you have a limited number of actions each turn, you can plan and do a super satisfying longer turn by combo-chaining a lot of actions back to back.
++ Scales really well and elegantly (just add more tiles to the setup) between all player counts (But the game take longer to play).
++ Great replayability due to using different player's  "map", the random tiles drawn during phases' setup and that not all tiles will show up in a single game (especially at lower number of players and because there is a lot of tiles).
++ Good value, as all Alea title (component of relatively good quality, but great price point).
++ There are smalls expansions (especially new player maps and some new tiles too) available for this game (which is useful to refresh the game when we have overplayed it).


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- Like many other have already said, the color choice (or at least the contrast of these colors) could have been better.
-- This feels like a multi-player solitaire game with few player interactions beside the main board and it can turn off some players (though I don't mind this especially that I usually play this game with my wife, so this turn out to be a good thing!).
-- The mini expansions are a bit expensive for what we get, but if you really like the base game, some are still worth it (though I would have prefer a real expansion consisting of all these mini-expansions bundled together that we could have bought in one shot).

RATING: 7
Castles of Burgundy is a great example of a game with a super simple rule set, but tons of decisions to be made within those simple rules.  There are a ton of ways to score points here, and balancing all those ways to score points is really challenging and brain burny.

The only complication comes in the form of the functions of all the buildings, which is actually what put me off this game for so long.  I was afraid that remembering all those special abilities would be a chore.  However, they really end up not being all that bad, and since the ability is only activated once, there's no need to remember what a tile does once you place it in your castle.

While I would advise playing with the starter boards in the first game, I really enjoyed the choices presented by the variable set-up boards.  Each board seems to have a focus, and even the decision of where to put the starting castle is difficult!

Overall, I found the game to be a good time, but without any real "wow" or fun factor.  It is a fun puzzle though, and I look forward to giving it some more play.

A masterpiece among board games driven by dice. Unicque mechanics and perfection in every datail. Rules aren't to complicated which makes it also good as challenging but still a family game. Subject - building of castles doesn't matter at all and edition could have been better but the enjoyment while playing compensates for small cons. Stefan Feld's one of the 3 best games.

I like this game, but the point salad of the game left Patricia thinking, "What's the point?"

I think there's a lot of depth to the game, but I don't know that we'll get it to the table enough to learn it all. I still am keeping it in my collection because I got it for cheap.

I had fun. A nice little builder. The dice are a nice way to both limit and focus your decisions. You can easily focus on building your estate, and do well. Once you get more advanced, you can incorporate the Building and Knowledge powers better.

RATING: 6
If this isn't the game that inspired the term point salad, it should have been. On almost every turn of the game, you will get points, as so many of the actions give you them. And you just play to get as many for yourself as you can (although the beginning of each round will be more about acquiring tiles, and the end of the round more about placing them, just a question of going with the ebb and flow of the tile refresh rate).

Very solitaire, although you will occasionally choose option A over option B because while they are identical to you, it costs another player a point or two (out of two hundred or so).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It wasn't too shabby for a first play. I'd give it a shot again, but the four-player game was maybe just a tad too long for what it is at heart, which is basically a fairly repetitive risk-management building game. Athematic, but fun. It's just that these abstract point-shuffling Euros are not what I'm into at the moment. It was a first game though, so opinions might change after another play or two (which I'd definitely be up for).  

UPDATE. Feld's games are basically just point orgies, and they don't really even pretend to be much else. While Castles gives you fun little one turn puzzles to solve and ramps up the angst, I can't really say that I enjoy it all that much. It gets bonus points because K loves it so much and I enjoy playing it with K.

Fantastic game, one that I return to again & again.  Scales beautifully; I find the 2-player to be just as rewarding an experience as with 3 or 4 players.  My wife, who tends to struggle sometimes with Euros, loves this game and finds the mechanics & strategy to be easier to understand than a lot of games.  When in doubt as to what to play, we usually will grab this one from off the shelf.

**********

After a couple of years and many plays, a little fatigue & malaise has begun to set in.  Familiarity breeds contempt, perhaps?  I really enjoy the game with 2 or 3 players, possibly because there is no guarantee that the tiles you need will appear.  No possibility of that in the 4-player game, where it begins to resemble card-counting in blackjack.  I have begun to understand how it is possible to overplay a game now.

El juego me ha encantado, me parece un juego original y con mucha rejugabilidad ya que puedes jugar a tableros distintos que parece que cambian las estrategias.
Además es muy jugable tanto a dos como a tres y cuatro jugadores, lo único que varía es el AP.
Eso sí la interacción con los demás es prácticamente nula, poco espacio para el puteo.
Sin duda de lo que más me ha gustado de las últimas cosas que he probado.

This is a real gem by Stefan Feld - the man is a fount of innovative games!  I have never played a dice / tile-laying game like this before.  There is a dizzying variety of ways to score victory points here, whether it be by completing regions of your estate, animal farming, selling goods, or maximizing bonus points from Knowledge tiles.  Often, many of those scoring options are available in any given turn and one is forced to judge which is best.  This flexibility also keeps the game engaging even when few tiles are available or when a bad dice roll(s) is made.  Some might be wary of the element of randomness introduced by the dice, but it is fairly minimal and easily mitigated by planning ahead and using worker tiles.  A top shelf Euro!

Feld's masterpiece. I do love some point salad. I think what really completes this game is the science tiles: 25 or so different tiles, each with a different effect, that totally changes the way you think about the game. Lots of variety in the boards. However, it is almost straight multiplayer-solitaire, a big negative for me. I need some player interaction to keep things interesting.

Lots of interesting decisions to be made, and i like how the dice force you to react tactically and don't let you plan things out that well. There is not a lot of player interaction since the victory point buildings force everyone to focus on different types of scoring.  Feels  dry and mechanical, but still somewhat enjoyable.

We really dig this game. It is awesome as a 2 player game (note: we never played it with more than 2 players), however the setup and take-down is painful.

BUT: The game plays great :)!

This is a strange one.  I love this game.  Every time I play it, I try a slightly different strategy and find new depths to the game mechanics.

On the other hand, it's really ugly and I very quickly ignore the idea of "building an estate".  It really just becomes an abstract game with terrible art and bland colors.  And yet, it's so much fun.  For some reason I never get tired of this game.

I have played this game online and in person many times now and it has turned into a favorite. I really enjoy building up my estate throughout the game and adapting my strategy to what the game offers. It plays well with all player counts and provides some tough decisions. There's nothing for direct interaction but players can still effect others through their actions. The dice roll adds some uncertainty to the game, and I like that, but the luck of the dice roll can be mitigated by leaving options open for the "what ifs". There is lots of replay to this game with all the possible combination of boards, tiles, and dice rolls. I love to play this and I will never turn down a game!

[b]includes 4th expansion -- the monastery boards[/b]

Die Burgen von Burgund is one of the better dice-based resource games I've played, although admittedly, I haven't played many. You have two dice that provide you with (generally) two actions each turn, with the dice pips limiting your available options. However, the kicker is that the game provides you with plenty of things to do. Gradually throughout the game, you build your town with hex-based buildings and features.

Castles of Burgundy is a relaxing affair. There's not a ton that players can do to really mess with your plans, so it's more a race of efficiency and good planning. For those looking for a solid Euro light on conflict, this one is a winner. It also happens to be a game my wife really enjoys, and it's very solid as a two player.

Great game and plays really smoothly given all that you can do. I think having 2 actions each turn is just enough so you don't overthink each turn. There is a chance to pull off some slick combos during the game too which is nice.

Main Positives: Attractive game. The board is busy but very manageable to navigate. I like the dice mitigation and everyone is able to get what they want in the game and can catch up probably at the 3rd-4th round.

Fun Factor: High
Complexity: Not very difficult to learn
Replayability: Once in a while but after playing my first game, I felt reassured that I can enjoy the game when it's pulled out.

Main Frustrations and Caveats:
Minor ones like cofusion with colours and matching them with certain tiles. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It looks complex to begin, but this is a gmae where playing a few turns gets you into the groove and by the end of turn one you have enough to form a strategy for turn two. The parallel to Macao is good and both have a similar 'feel'. Castles was easy to play but watch out for AP.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Mainly because it's set in Bourgogne, my second favourite French region. After Normandie, of course!

Strategically, I like this game very much. However, what I don't like are the tiny, fiddly pieces, and the fact that all the knowledge tiles are different, so you need to learn every one of them: so cumbersome!

PS: just saw they say on the back box that Burgundy is in the Loire Valley: IT MOST CERTAINLY IS NOT!!! NO, not even in medieval times, when Burgundy was bigger than it is now. Unforgivable mistake!

My only complaint is the production and components. For being such a well loved and amazing game, this components are flimsy and drab.

This game has a bit of everything-tile placement(granted small, but still there, so the tactile feel is there), dice acting like worker placement to a sense. Blind bag draws, replayability due to the different player boards. This one is one that we will always play as long as time will allow. Thinky, but not too horrible, and relatively easy for most to at least catch on to play and enjoy themselves.

One of my favorites.  Plays very well with two, three or four players, and your strategy changes with each.  Game mechanics signify which turn and phase you are in, which is a very nice design touch.  Lots of ways to score points, which may be a turn off to some, is a great asset as come from behind victories are very possible with careful planning - to me this makes the game exciting and I'm always on the edge of my seat.  Great balance of luck versus strategy.

Two complaints that stop this from being a 10.  The hexes are so small, and the color scheme is very bland, which leads to consistent confusion on which tiles are which (the piece size I understand though, as it keeps the cost of the game down).  Second, the box is ill suited for the game (again though, they recycle boxes to keep prices down).  I solved the latter by modifying the insert by placing dividers to cut each tray in half, and this solved the problem.

Hmm...with that said, I'm changing my ranking to a 9.5 since the second complaint is solved.  In fact, I can play this in a bar comfortably by playing the tiles from the box.

Really solid game with lucid rules that explain the great options left open to the player.  These options allow for plenty of interesting choices.  Plays GREAT with any number.  Only real complaint is the lack-luster art design and box (which you too can remedy easily!).

I don’t play that many Euro games,  it for my money this was both enjoyable and engaging. The instructions had us scratching our heads a bit but my bright nephews helped figure out most everything. There is a lot of chrome and things to keep track of so paying attention is important. Resources are limited so denying your opponents what they need can be as critical as claiming what you need. All in all a very clever game that will get multiple replays.

Initial rating based on 2 plays, with 3 and 4 players. So far, I'm impressed. It's like a fun multiplayer puzzle. Unlike many Euro's that have snowball effects, this one goes the opposite direction, as options become increasingly more scarce as the game progresses. It's also fairly simple if memory intensive. Highly recommend printing a reference card, and the failure to include them I would consider a rather glaring omission. Outside of that, it has upward mobility potential, especially if there are expansions.

Always have a game going on Boiteajeux. The design is genius.

After 25+ plays I have come to feel that the randomness of the flop(ie new round tile offer) often (between equally skilled players) determines the outcome (namely, most often, the yellow tiles with a goods bonus, the points you can luck into with these tiles broke the game for me, ie made it solvable or made it feel solvable anyways or maybe made if feel like there is a default strategy(something not present in Feld's masterpiece Trajan))

The design of this game is really tight. Everything works perfectly. Its the quintessential Euro, Feldian point-salad, with a terrible color palette, abstruse symbolsism, a million various chips, and feels like multiplayer solitare, with only passive aggressive player interaction, yet its fun and competitive because it is so well designed. Perfect for two players and a glass of wine.

Too much choices for 4 people. Especially AP-prone people.
I want to try this with three people before I make a final statement.
I also don't like that the turn order is connected to using boats. It actually makes it a loserbashing mechanic, since if the other players earlier than you in the turn focus on getting even more boats you have no chance of catching up.
It should be connected to taking workers or something since taking workers means you give up a die anyway.
Tried it now with three players, a much better game.
My rating is 8 for three players and 6 for four players.

2) Oh, this is actually... really simple once you understand it.

3) oh my god no it's not simple it's like someone set off a string of firecrackers in my brain

The phrase "point salad" has been tossed around (get it) and it's true. Little bunches of points here and there for doing nearly everything. And that's the puzzle to solve: what do you do, in this very moment, that will net you the most of those bunches now, but even more later? Your choices branch, and spread, and branch again, until you're sitting there muttering to yourself for ages, mentally working through the choices that fractal out before you. It's absolutely a game that you can fall into analysis paralysis with, but I never found it getting too bogged down because of this.

The dice mechanic is clever. It has gentle indirect conflict by buying tiles out from the other player's nose. The whole game is just so damn satisfying to play, but is balanced by having everything you want just a little out of your reach. If you could just... stretch a little... further... and then the game has finished and you haven't completed half of the things you set out to do (or maybe that's just me)

In terms of game play - this is a smooth as my baby's bum! 

I see the first few plays being more multi-player solitaire as we are generally more concerned about our own dice and what we can do with it. I imagine that as I become more familiar with the game that I will pay more attention to what others are doing and let that start influencing my decisions.

My wife's complaint after the first play is that it is too fiddly. 

I am not a component guy, but this game suffers. The tiles are thin, the player boards are essentially thick paper, and the game should have at least come with some plastic bags for all the bits. I give Ravensburger a 'D' grade for the components.

I really look forward to future plays.

An excellent strategic game about making your estate prosper and expand by raising buildings, gathering knowledge and trading goods. It's got a little bit of Puerto Rico, Agricola and Kingsburg in it - which, naturally, all adds up for a great experience.

This game is very enjoyable. It has the right amount of randomness, with the ability to manipulate your dice if you really need something. It also allows you to form adaptive strategies, and try to manipulate your opponents strategies slightly.

This is an interesting low-interaction game that plays smoothly and comfortably.  The dice mechanic adds an interesting level of constraint to the system, but for this type of experience, I enjoy the extortive marketplace of a game like Keyharvest.

I can understand why it is so highly rated and well regarded, and I enjoy when I play it, but I don't reflect on how I should have played differently afterwards (reflection is a hallmark of a great game, in my opinion).

Wow, what a game! I'm so sorry now it gathered dust for a few months on my shelf (the art was putting me off). Now I can't find anything about it that I don't like, I even started appreciating the art! The game is incredibly balanced and feels very tight until the end. It has great flow, no downtime at all with two players (provided you roll your dice during the other player's turn and you also keep an eye on what she/he is doing). The rules are simple and well written and the board really helps with remembering everything. I can't remember when was the last time I played a game with so much depth that was so easy to learn!

The engines underlying the game are impressively efficient. I appreciate the satisfying chains you can pull off via various tile placements. Just generally speaking, I admire the game's design ... but it's just so DRY. It's not at all like "Suburbia," where we're all eager to talk about the peculiarities of our boroughs when the game ends. The estates of "Burgundy" are nothing more than VP generators. There's no particular joy in a fully-filled pasture beyond the boatload of VP it provides you. So admirable, yes, but hard to really love.

Likes: Very interesting implementation of dice. There is also variety in the boards.

Dislikes: Rolling doubles of the one number you don't want that turn can be brutal, but I guess you still get 2 (or 4) workers out of it. I think the brown buildings are generally the strongest, but there are plenty to go around. Theme may be dry to some players.

I think this game is almost perfect.  Fun with 2, 3, or 4.  There is also a solo variant that is worth trying out.  Usually, dice rolling is my least favorite mechanic but the ease of working workers into your strategy mitigates this.  This is probably in my top 3 for eurogames.  It really does feel like you are building up a little estate and it is quite satisfying at the end.  Many eurogames feel like they end just as you have settled into a strategy, this one however feels like it last for quite a bit of time so it is not a shock when it is over.  I've never heard of someone not liking this.

RATING: 8.5
A very strong game. Tactical and interesting. Some luck which in this case is fine because there are mitigating factors, Not as much player interaction as I'd like, esentially you are competing for tiles and 1st and 2nd in completing your board areas.

I've been feeling fairly Euroed out for the last couple years but this is a nice one for getting a bit of Euro flavour. The dice throw in a nice dose of chance, mitigated by the worker tiles while the variable end of game scoring bonuses allows for some different strategies from game to game. Based on one play.

What makes Castles of Burgundy so brilliant isn't just that it plays well online both at http://www.yucata.de and http://www.boiteajeux.net. No, what makes it brilliant is that, unlike many worker placement games like Stone Age and Kingsburg, the total sum of your die doesn't contribute to your success. Instead, if you roll, say, snake eyes, you can take a tile in the 1 spot and place it on your map that is for the 1 spot. The idea is to fill your multi-colored, multi-numbered map.

A great dice-based euro. The dice add just the right amount of manageable luck. Some people might call it a point salad, but I think the boundaries between what directly gives you points and what indirectly helps you to get things in order to get points is pretty clear (unlike games like Agricola where every achievement is also directly rewarded with VPs).

I've wanted this game for so long. I had so many expectations. A cross of Kingsburg, Terra Mystica and Suburbia. Sadly, its more of Kingsburg dice rolling to get supplies, then more dice to get permission to build, then more dice to gain victory points. A strategy can be built but there is very little economic engine to this game and everything you do, no matter what, depends on the roll of the dice. 

It's not a bad game, it's just not what I expected.

RATING: 5
Subjectwise: again clear that Stefan Feld was allowed to fondle the design at length, breaking the poor thing's joyous spirit and utterly and irrevocably draining it of anything that might resemble something human in the process. The preview video posted at Cliquenabend shows a rather abstract prototype: really, it looks a lot better than the kitschy retheme of castles in Burgundy, and stresses very well the fact that Feld's games are never about a subject, and all about clean and sterile mathematics. Stefan Feld is the Mr. Spock (or Data, whomever you prefer) of game design. 

Game-technically DBvB is a friendly game of dice-driven puzzling. The game doesn't do anything complex or exponential, it's only about making smart choices based on random inputs and generous modifier schemes. This is the Good Way to do dice; it's perhaps not as clever as in Yspahan or Troyes, but as the game progresses you can always select from several [i]interesting[/i] options no matter what the dice come up on. The skill is in recognising the best option, and perhaps foiling the plans of the other players in the process. Because this title has no point snowball engine, there is a continuous feel of involvement right to the end. That is also fine with me. The downside is, unfortunately, that with 4 players it takes too long to play to completion. There is a not insignificant amount of calculations involved, and since planning your exact actions is not really possible until it is your turn, the game begins to drag. As a result I want to stick to the lower end of the indicated player range.

When I first played it, I was pleasantly surprised by Feld's offspring, and put it on my purchase list. Then came along a second puzzle game of his, Trajan, and speaking for myself Trajan really renders Burgen obsolete. The reason is simply that the dice in this title become boring after a while: there is no sense of accomplishment when you decide on how to use the dice. Trajan's Mancala wheel is rather different and offloads its use entirely onto the player, making him completely responsible for an efficient traversal of the game's action state space. Burgen is dumb in this respect, and when I play it I never feel engaged or challenged. That is of course not the same as playing the game well: there [i]is[/i] skill in selecting the proper action. But there isn't much to tie multiple turns in a row together, and that's what bugs me. Consequently I've downgraded the rate for this game: it also indicates my stance on which of the two titles is 'better' much more clearly than previously.

Not much long term planning involved, which puts this on the lighter side of things for me - plus I have to relearn all the tiles each time I pull it out which means I don't really start playing until the 2nd game...

Played this for the first time during Christmas 2015, and didn't even get a full game in.  Even though we didn't finish I knew I would enjoy this game.  This is a must buy for me.  It is area management/building and what is really neat are the bonuses the tiles give you once you build them onto your board.  There's also a main board that acts like a roundel of sorts that gives you different options of buildings, etc. depending on what you rolled on your dice.

Feld just knows how to dice better than anybody.  Very rarely does it happen that you get a roll where there is absolutely nothing you can do.  I really would like to cut the gametime of this for us from 60 minutes to 40 or so.  This game is a ton of fun, and despite some slight randomness within the market distribution, there is a tight element of player control.  Looking forward to playing this more and expect that its rating may go up.

Very solid euro style game.  The Castles of Burgundy is a gamers game with lots of things to consider and multiple paths to victory.  The large hexagonal player maps are broken down into lots of small hexes.  Players take actions, eventually placing hexagonal tiles on their personal play maps and score points through out the game.  There is also a final scoring at the end.  The hex chit mechanisms create a plethora of opportunities which can seem overwhelming to new players.  The game has good replayability and is fun and challenging to play.  I like The Castles of Burgundy with either 3 or 4 players at the table.  The Castles of Burgundy made my top 50 games for euro style games I enjoy playing of all time.

Has some randomness but still able to plan. Only problems are with the tiles there is a little bit of icon overload on the yellow tiles. Just a lot of them. The colors of the tiles needed to be more easily identified, green and yellow look close to each other, the design on the back of the tiles should have been varied by tile type. Game best played with a gaming group, not something to pull out for non gaming visitors, try Lords of Waterdeep for that.

RATING: 9.5
Truly a remarkable game by Stefan Feld.  While his games often have interlocking mechanisms, this one gives the player more room for independent choices.

Each turn players roll two dice, and the numbers allow them to perform actions - take a tile, place a tile, ship goods, or take workers.  Workers help alter the luck of the die roll, while the variety of tiles offer options for points.

A little tile-laying, a twist on worker placement, and a new twist on dice in board games.  There are so many ways to score points that it makes your head spin - yet there is no clear path to victory.  Plus there are a variety of player boards, offering endless variety.  Don't want to play too long?  Simply cut down the number of phases.

Lots of options and easy to dive into once you get a hang of it.  This is just a great game and I look forward to playing it again soon.

This is one great game to play. Dice rolling that you can manipulate pretty much to anything you need so no much of luck is involved. I just love those kind of games where you roll dice and than decide what they do. If you love to play games like Roll for the Galaxy, Alien Frontiers, Artifacts Inc....this is a game for you.

RATING: 8.75
One of my favorite games! In my opinion, this game plays just as well with 2 players as 3 or 4. This is one of my wife's favorite game to play with me. There are a lot of things you have to explain upfront when teaching the game, but after a few rounds of play it's very easy to pick up. Even though you take actions using dice, there are many different options and ways to manipulate the dice to be able to to what you want. I would recommend this to people who like medium weight Euro-games.

This is a game that I want to keep hitting my table, and I have a real soft spot for this one.

RATING: 9.5
Game with dices that doesn´t feel like they decide who will win. I enjoy the amount of decisions in almost every round where you can go by different path to victory. The art is OK - I don´t get why everyone claims it is so ugly - maybe some depictions could be more clear or difference between light green and yellow is not too big, but overall I am not disappointed by the artistic part of the game. 

What I like:
- this is a perfect two player game, good for "nongamers" as there is no direct conflict
- The tactics and strategy is a big part of the game, dice only narrow your options. And there is nice amount of luck involved.
- overall, the game atmosphere is nice, I just enjoy playing this, everything clicked for me here.
- lots of different boards (some weaker, some stronger) adds to the replayability a lot

What I dislike:
- game boards could be thicker 
- the color palette is not very good, I assume light green, dark green and yellow tiles could do some issues for somebody (especially when playing in the darker room)
- you should be careful what board you choose, some boards are just impossible to beat with the weak ones (but on the other side this can possibly solve the issue with different player strength)

After a couple of plays, this might be my favorite Feld. It doesn't have as many "moving parts" as Bora Bora, or Trajan, so it is easier to teach and learn. Planning ahead is easier for me than trying to manage the Windrose in Macao or the mancala in Trajan. I feel like I can try a number of different approaches. There is an nice little "race for the key piece" and "race for the bonuses" interaction. The possibility of multiple map layouts seems to keep the game fresh.

I've been enjoying this, but finding it more tactical than I'd prefer - it seems like with decent play, most players can fill nearly everything on their mat by endgame. I'd rather players had to make more choices about "do X instead of Y" rather than choices about "do X first and Y later". Also, it tends to go a little on the long side. I wonder if playing 4 rounds instead of 5 would improve the game...

Very strategic game. It's somewhat interactive and it keeps my attention throughout. However, we had to refer to the rules quite a bit to understand what the knowledge tiles did and this disrupted strategy a little. If you don't know what everything does, then you can't plan for it. I'm assuming that as you play more you'll eventually remember what the knowledge tiles do and can work them in better. But there are a number of them. It also took us about 4 hours the first time with three players. But we hadn't read the rules until we started.

Only ever played it as 2-player, but would recommend it at that. I don't generally like dice-rolling games, but CoB does do it well (probably as well as I've seen it done). For such a random mechanic the game does a great job of giving you options no matter what. The yellow and black tiles make the game very interesting, and I like that the different player mats encourage different strategies.

The component quality is pretty low, and the box insert is famously terrible. I bought opaque bags per tile type, which really helps, but it is very irritating that the game comes in such a bad state. The player mats are pathetically flimsy. If there were a more expensive and higher quality version of this I would be much happier.

RATING: 7.5
A good game with an interesting dice mechanic.  On the flip side, the game scores most points in real time in a game that moves quickly, therefore scoring can be easily corrupted by knuckleheads like yours truly.  I much prefer games that primarily use end game scoring or limited real time scoring.

I should not like this game.  I don't like most modern Euros.  I don't like worker placement (although this isn't'), and I prefer to find engines in cars, not games (although there isn't much of an engine in this).  The learning curve on this one can cause some new players (my wife) to get frustrated with it, and insist that they'll never play it again.  So why do I like it?  Maybe because once I figured out the intricate way everything fit together, the game just grew on me.  It's solid, the theme works, the mechanisms work, and the challenge of the game is one that intrigues me enough that I'm OK with the fact that there is absolutely NO relationship between the theme and the mechanism.  

UPDATE: November, 2015: rating has bumped up from 8 to 9.  The fact that this game rocks with two players has a lot to do with that.

UPDATE: December, 2016: rating is now 10.

I think burned out on this game from too many plays.  This is another game where I think the decision tree gets to be so broad that I can't really tell if players are winning by skill or simply falling into good situations.  I think the popularity comes from the fact that you always have something to do so players never feel blocked or left out.  Its not a bad game, but its far from being Feld's best and, IMHO, a bit overrated.

RATING: 9
This is the "light Feld" of our collection.  Like it's big brother Aquasphere, Castles thrives off of squeezing out extra actions under the constraints of the dice/tiles.

It's quick to play, makes a great 2p experience, and really challenges you to make optimal plays.

An excellent game that is easy to learn, easy to teach and great fun to play.

Although it looks complex at first glance because the instructions introduce a lot of mechanics all at once, it's a very easy to learn game with high replayability, a lot of depth and able to do varying strategies (It's not number 10 overall and 9 in strategy in vain). I played first time with my SO that is not a gamer and she was able to quickly follow the mechanics and start planning strategies.

I do recommend however to watch a howto video before playing.

The setup for a game is fairly quick and once you familiarize with it you can achieve fast paced games. I've only played it with 2 people as it is suggested and even when we were both learning the rules after a couple of phases it got really fun and competitive.

I realize now that I have more games in my collection by Stefan Feld than any other game designer, and there is good reason why. He knows how to design games with innovative mechanics and couple that with interesting and creative gameplay. 

Castles of Burgundy is another fine example. Sure the production is a bit washed out in terms of graphics and he always seems to love iconography on everything, but in the end the game is fun and I want to keep playing.

This is like an 8-9er for me.  I'm not sure why it sticks out more than other "you can do this, that, or this, or that, or this for points and they all overlap" games.  I guess I just find the ways it does it interesting and not for its own sake.

However, the design feels like it was created 12-25 years before it was produced. The rules are very obviously translated to English as a second language, which means there are some confusing rules that we often have to just flip a coin on what exactly they mean.

Provisional rating: 7. My wife and I enjoy the 2-player game. The dice bring an interesting element in and force you to consider many possible routes to your goal. Strategies can change quickly. The bits are good quality, but the pale color scheme and lack of iconography on many of the tiles makes it hard to learn.

Update: 8 after several more plays. The crappy iconography and color scheme is melting away to the fun of implementing a scheme and messing with your opponent.

Up-update: 9. Wow, there's a lot to it.

Game tends to take a little longer than the box says but surprisingly my friends and I didn't hit any lulls. The using dice as actions works well but is especially effective having the ability to alter dice rolls using worker tiles. Has a great level of strategy but rules aren't overly complicated and luck of the roll is greatly reduced with everything you can do a turn. Each player gets an "estate" mat in addition to the shared game board. Mat contains not only the space the players build on but a well done reference to most of the actions and tiles you can take in the game. Rules are well written with a bar on the right of each page summarizing the rules on that page. Looks like it will be one of my favorite games.

This game is sleek, streamlined, and plays like a dream. It's a good length and scales well to any player count. The decisions you make regarding what to do with your dice are rarely cut-and-dry. And, despite being dice-driven, luck does not feel like an overly significant factor. I like playing it, I really do.

But here's the thing. If I bring Castles of Burgundy and two other games to a board game night, we always end up playing one of the other games. Why? The box is ugly. The boards are ugly. The pieces are ugly. The theme, if there even is one, is powerfully boring. Which is to say: this is a hard game to get people interested in. It can even be a hard game to get myself interested in--and I already know I like it. I consider that a problem.

It's hard to imagine a dice-euro getting better than this.  It has an elegant combination of strategy and tactics, and the way to overcome your opponent will not always be the same every game.  No theme to speak of, but if you're into euros you already don't care about that.

As a side note, I can't imagine a worse name for a game.  It's truly beyond parody when it comes to "soul-less" euros.

This is a good dice rolling game with tonnes of options and ways to score points. Luck can play a roll in the game with a bad roll but most of the time it can be overcome. With so many decisions, play can really slow when having to make a tough decision or have to change plans. If players let someone fill up a farm with only one animal type, they will most likely win. The game is also a little more meaner in a 2 player game as you can keep track of your opponent.

This game is an exellent puzzle and affords "comboing" of tiles as you place them. Seeing and understanding thoses combinations is the ket to winning the game. The dice rolls can work against you, but you nearly always have someting profitable you can do. The game induces AP in players and with four of them, can take a long time to get through. I like it a lot with just two players and will play it with three. At that player number the game is quite satisfying to play and I like the look of my estate when the game is finished.

RATING: 9
The Castles of Burgundy is a solid competitive game for those who like to think, calculate and strategize. The artwork is dull but game play is tight and tense. 

The strategic aspect comes from controlling the random elements of the setup and optimizing the tile abilities to maximize victory points. Players have to work with the random die rolls and random tiles available each round. They have to choose the tiles wisely and place them in just the right order so that their abilities work together to multiple their benefits. 

The limited selection of tiles each round reduces AP and encourages tactical moves. There is room for long-term planning but to win, players have to be flexible and responsive to change. In this sense, "Castles" has a nice balance between luck and skill. Veteran players definitely have an edge but new players can still stand a chance.

The random setup coupled with extra player boards provided mean high replayability. If you only want a pretty-looking game, this is not for you. But if you care even a little about the game play experience, you will enjoy "Castles" and quickly forget the shortcoming in the art department.

Brilliant 2-player game. Gives you the feeling that you have a buffet of great options in front of you at every turn.

The thing I like about The Castles of Burgundy is that the dice do their job of lightening things up without keeping players from still controlling their own fate.  The luck is there, but it is not anything that can not be overcome by a savvy player.  There are plenty of good decisions to make without making it too tough for new players.  It's not in the same league as my favorites, but it has it's place as a more casual euro.

The theme and the graphics design are rather dull. But the game behind is just perfect for my taste. The game is about scoring the more points with a limited number of actions. The first games are rather disconcerting due to the many options available.
Many ways to score and various strategies. Different boards offer renewed challenges, and increase replaiability.

A good medium complexity strategy games, a little more complex than "In the year of the dragon".

It may be that I was expecting a lot from the game since I have heard so many good reviews, but I found it very monotonous and too long. I also felt that the downtime was way too much compared to how much time I spent on my turn. The game didn't grow as it progressed, there were always the same options available, and previous choices didn't really affect the next turn. Every turn felt pretty isolated. It has a neat mechanism and I enjoyed it and seems very well designed, but it didn't capture my attention as it did for other people. I would play it if people wanted to, but I won't rush to join in a game of The Castles of Burgundy.

I would give it a few more tries if it wasn't for the massive amount of downtime.

A great game that I like more with each play, but...

...my desire to play it is lessened  by the simple ugliness and cheapness of the presentation--the player boards are almost paper, the pieces ridiculously thin. I have enjoyed my plays but my enthusiasm to play again is not what it should be--presentation matters, especially in board games. I also find the game rules to be somewhat opaque...even though it's not especially complex, it always takes me a while to remember how to play. Not sure why that is. I've always felt that Feld's mechanisms are completely divorced from his themes, making his games harder to learn, and that's partly the issue here. I suspect the graphic presentation is also partly to blame. 

But really, why hasn't anyone done a nice version of this game??? Maybe with some color other than brown? Loses a point in my rating for the general lack of quality in the production and a poor graphic presentation that makes it harder to play than it should be.

I love the weight of this game.  The decisions are rich but not stressful.  The brain burn is there, but it's not overwhelming, especially since there's no punishment mechanism. I love teaching it to new players and they usually grasp it quickly. With 50 actions a game, theres plenty of time for new players to "click" with whats going on start really playing instead of trying to figure it out the first time around.  And even with the 25 turns it usually moves fast. The use of dice is awesome. They limit your choices, but not your strategy, and can always be mitigated.  People harp on the art, but I don't mind the found in a 70's attic look.  Yes it could be better, but as it is it's got charm to me. Feld's not much for theme, but the mechanics are so strong that it's like watching a work of art come together when you play it.  A super duper solid mid weight euro.  Definitely amongst my favorite, if not my #1

Pretty thinky game where the only interaction with your opponent involves tile/chit denial.

Have only played it once so far with three players, and that was enough to tell me I don't ever want to play it with four.

Update: Clearly the best of Feld's games and deserving of its high BGG rank. Probably okay to play with four if everyone is experienced, but the game will still take awhile.

*Updating to a 9 -- Would buy INSTANTLY a deluxe edition. I don't think Ravensburger has ever gone the Kickstarter route, so maybe some kind of anniversary edition will happen some day.

RATING: 9.1
The first visual impression is not the best and all the boards and tokens are made of plain cardboard (well, that also helps to keep the game price low).
In the first steps, it also seems that one is going to be lost among all the different building abilities, however, just after one or two rounds...the ideias start to flood in one´s head, our hands rush to grab the tiles we want or need (sometimes even jumping the turn order!), we get excited by how many different ways we can make points and how we get thrilled to find an action that scores a couple more points than other action that was already good in itself...
There´s always a great enjoyment in a game where you have two actions but can always use them to do something useful - the question is that if you can optimize the most of those actions, fulfil objectifs earlier than other players, etc
Although some work is required to build the set up after each round (5 rounds overall), the game plays in just about 90 min with players with some knowledge and is a great experience that soon becomes addictive.
A great work, possible the greatest until now, by Stefan Feld!

RATING: 5
After some plays my rating goes down again.
The game is too balanced in my opinion. If you play well, you you have some actions to spare in the end, with which you cant do anything meaningful. Moreover its annoying that you cant keep players from tiles, because the tiles will come up in later rounds or in the black market at random anyway.

4-player seemed to have just a tad too much downtime between turns for my taste. It's been compared to Troyes, but I think the latter slightly edges it out in terms of fun. (There's room to own both, as the only comparison is the use of dice.) I enjoy this game with fewer than four players. Not a lot of interaction, other than taking things before other players get a chance to. 

Update: I don't think the fourth player adds anything (and I mean anything) to the gaming experience. In fact, it detracts, because that extra downtime is painful. I won't play it with four.

RATING: 6
Critically acclaimed by BGG on the whole and my first Feld game. Going to this from Kingsburg felt like a next step toward Euro gaming.

Pros: Fun dice management mechanism. Few actions per turn makes this game easy to play. Variable board setup between the 5 phases of the game. Comprehensive rulebook.

Neutral: Cheaper quality components keep cost down, but not bad quality. Building the estate isn't like going up a tech tree.

Cons: small cardboard chits and symbols which make it hard to read in some lighting. Lack of plastic bags and useless box tray make component separation and game setup a problem.

Despite the variable setup, the game doesn't seem that deep strategically.

Review Update: 
So this is one of the best games I own. Portable, mid-weight complexity, and short play time. My girlfriend and I really enjoy the "puzzle" mechanic of this game and have started to get more games with that same feel (Patchwork and Suburbia being my favorite so far). I said the art was so-so but honestly its come to grow on me and no matter how many times I play this game it never gets old. I'm going to bump this game from a nine to a solid 10 for us!


Original Review:
My second tier euro, after Harbour and Scoville. The game that solidified my SO's love of games and euros in particular. The only obstacle to learning the game is knowing what each of the tiles do, and they're are quite a few of them. I know this is a Feld game, but it would be a solid 10 if they did an art update.

I really like aesthetics in my games as well as the tactile feel of components and this game just doesn't have any of that. The color choices are abysmal and the component quality leaves a bit to be desired. I really don't understand why designers/publishers of euros can't put even a tiny bit more effort in the artwork/theme/components of their games.

However, Castles of Burgundy with it's green/yellow/brown mesh of blah somehow finds a way to charm the hearts of many. I am not immune because I can't help but really enjoy this game every time I bring it to the table.

The game is so simple and elegant and yet provides a nice puzzle to try and piece together while also working out what your opponents need and getting those tiles before they can.

The turns are lightning quick and the game always ends sooner than you want.

RATING: 8.5
This is a great game.  I really enjoy the fact that the "luck" of dice rolling can be changed using your workers, so you always have the chance to change what luck has provided.  There are so many different ways to score points that it becomes a bit too "analytical" for some peoples tastes, and that's where the beauty of the game comes through for me.  You truly have to think about what the "best" option is for you each turn, because all options are good in their own way.  The limited "vision" provided the players each round makes it interesting also - each round, tiles are replaced with news tiles, therefore you don't now how your strategy may need to change based on what is available.  I believe this game can be played in under an hour, but the true play time will be determined by how much analyzing each player does on their turn - this could mean a 2 hour game, or longer.  But I do recommend Castles of Burgundy, it's very fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.1
Castles of Burgundy is extremely relaxing while also being engaging and strategic.  The dice mitigation is fun and allows you to make interesting decisions, the knowledge tiles (with their terrible iconography) give you interesting and diverse abilities.  Also you get to have a farm full of cows and you get more points for having lots of cows.  Probably best at the two player count due to increased ability to interfere with your opponent, but honestly I don't really feel like blocking your opponent is really worth it most of the time anyway and have personally enjoyed the game almost equally at all player counts.

Addictive gameplay.  Any game where you are pushing your opponents to finish their actions so you can take your turn is a good indicator of a great game.

I bought this game on a whim after finding it on Amazon for $19.99. I was looking for a game with decent depth that could play well with two players (for my wife and I), with the option to scale up to more players if needed. What a pleasant surprise this game was! It took us a game or two to fully understand the tile icons, but once you get the hang of it the game is very intuitive, and the player aids on the player boards and rule book help tremendously. 

What I love about this game: It uses dice in a very interesting way, with a good luck mitigation mechanism of using "workers" to plus or minus a die's result. Not feeling lucky? You can stock up on workers to ensure that you'll get the result you are looking for. I love the variable player boards, so each game you will have a different strategy. The game isn't too confrontational, but there are moments when your opponent will unintentionally (or intentionally) take what you need. The game length is just right for me (though if my wife wants to play, this will probably be the only game she plays that night...each game usually takes us around 90 minutes, but we are in no rush). People complain about the art, but I couldn't care less. This game is great!

Game set up was the only draw back to this game. The insert the game comes with is not ideal. I tried drawstring bags, but eventually purchased a Plano box which fits perfectly in the box and organizes everything wonderfully.

A classic for a reason. Does a phenomenal job of using dice to create difficult decisions while still providing lots of ways for the players to control and mitigate their dice rolls. The components are nothing fancy, but they're totally adequate, and since I was able to find this brand new for under $20, I'm happy to accept thinner than usual cardboard. Great with 2 players; have not tried it with more.

So far I've only played this game twice (and only with the number 1 player boards) and will certainly play it again. However, so far I don't enjoy it as much as I had hoped to.

I am a big fan of dice games and enjoy the central mechanic. However, there are a few things that really let the game down for me. 

Firstly; it seems to suffer from that thing which is often criticised in heavy Euros - it's too balanced. It seems very difficult to pull away from the crowd in any meaningful way.

Secondly; the single-hex village space means that lucky rolling in the first turn can create a significant advantage for the first player able to complete this (10 bonus points for completing in the first turn and 5-7 for the bonus tile). Given that it's most likely that all players will easily fill up about 3 quarters of their boards over the course of the game, there's no good reason to choose to start a larger village at this stage instead - any player who gets the opportunity will be guaranteed to take it.

Thirdly; (and this is only a small niggle really) the "Knowledge" tiles seem lazily unthematic - why not call them universities or monasteries or something?

Excellent Feld game.  Simple dice action mechanic.  Luck can be offset by worker tiles.  Tiles can be played in specific order to create chain combos, which is both satisfying and integral to strategy.  Some aspects of the game can feel tacked on, mainly the "goods" mechanic.  Luck does have a significant role in this game (dice), but a clever player can usually make the most of his/her rolls.  The game scales decently, although the 2 player game can be cheapened by lack of "mine" tiles, making turn order a killer.  All in all, a really enjoyable game, with many different paths to victory.

This is such a well-crafted game. The reason why some dislike the game (being an elaborate optimization puzzle game) is exactly why I enjoy it so much. I don't mind the limited player interaction, because that's not why we play this game. The mechanics are so strong, and the journey from clean slate to fully-developed estate is rewarding, especially if you have successfully made the best of your scoring opportunities. In my opinion, a first-class Eurogame.

2-4

Doel van het spel:

Na de 5de etappe (25 rondes) volgt er een eindwaardering. De speler met de meeste punten wint het spel. In geval van gelijkstand wint de speler die heerst over het vorstendom met de meeste lege velden. Is het nog steeds gelijk, dan wint de speler die het laatst aan bod kwam volgens het spelersvolgordespoor. 

Voorbereiding:

+ Sorteer alle tegels per kleur (rugzijde) en leg ze gedekt naast het speelbord. + Schud alle goederentegels. Maak 5 gedekte stapels van 5 tegels, leg op ieder veld (A-B-C-D-E) 1 stapel en leg de rest gedekt naast het speelbord. 
+ Leg de bonuskaarten op hun desbetreffende plaats op het speelbord. 
+ Iedere speler kiest een kleur en ontvangt: 2 dobbelstenen, 2 pionnen (1 spelersvolgordespoor en 1 puntenspoor), een spelersbord met 1 burcht, 3 willekeurige goederentegels (dezelfde tegels komen op elkaar te liggen) en één zilverling. 
+ Kies een startspeler en hij krijgt de witte dobbelsteen + 1 arbeider. De volgende speler, met de wijzers van de klok mee, ontvangt 2 arbeiders, de derde speler ontvangt 3 arbeiders, ..... Ook de spelersvolgorde op het spelersvolgordespoor wordt aangepast: startspeler bovenaan, daaronder de 2de speler, daaronder de 3de speler, .... 

Speelverloop:

Het spel bestaat uit 5 etappes (van A tot E) 

Voorbereiding van iedere etappe: 

+ Alle overgebleven tegels (geen goederentegels) worden van het speelbord verwijderd.
+ De meest linkse gedekte stapel goederentegels wordt open gelegd.
+ Vul het speelbord opnieuw aan met zeshoekige tegels (aantal is afhankelijk van het aantal spelers) met de overeenkomstige kleur. 

Elke etappe bestaat uit 5 rondes.

Een speelronde bestaat uit: 

A/ Witte dobbelsteen 

De startspeler gooit met de witte dobbelsteen en plaatst de bovenste goederentegel op het overeenkomstige veld met de dobbelsteenwaarde. 

B/ Acties 

Iedere speler gooit met zijn dobbelstenen en de startspeler voert zijn volledige beurt uit. Daarna speelt de volgende speler op het volgordespoor (van rechts naar links, in een toren van boven naar onder) zijn spelbeurt, enz.... Je kan per beurt maar 2 acties uitvoeren (1 actie/dobbelsteen). Eenzelfde actie mag meermaals gekozen worden. De volgende acties zijn beschikbaar: 

1/ Tegel van het speelbord nemen: 

De speler neemt een tegel naar keuze van het depot (speelbord) gelijk aan de dobbelsteenwaarde. Hij legt de tegel in zijn opslagplaats (onderaan links op zijn spelersbord, niet in zijn vorstendom). 

2/ Tegel in jouw vorstendom plaatsen: 

De speler plaatst een tegel vanuit zijn opslagplaats in zijn vorstendom. Hij plaatst de tegel op een vrij veld gelijk aan de dobbelsteenwaarde en altijd grenzend aan minstens één al reeds geplaatste tegel. De kleur van de tegel moet overeenkomen met het kleur van het veld. De eigenschap van de tegel wordt geactiveerd (Zie tegels). 

3/ Goederen verkopen: 

De speler verkoopt al zijn goederen van de soort gelijk aan de dobbelsteenwaarde. Alle tegels worden omgedraaid en de speler krijgt 1 zilverling + overwinningspunten (waarde/goederentegel = aantal spelers). 

4/ Arbeiders nemen: 

De speler ontvangt 2 arbeidersfiches ongeacht het getal op zijn dobbelsteen. Een speler kan eenmaal tijdens zijn beurt 2 zilverlingen betalen om een tegel naar keuze uit het zwarte depot te nemen. De tegel legt hij (zoals gebruikelijk) in zijn opslagplaats. Dit telt niet als een actie. 

Tegels met hun eigenschap:

Schip: 

1. Neem “alle” goederentegels van één goederenveld naar keuze en plaats ze in jouw magazijn. 
2. Verplaats jouw pion op het spelersvolgordespoor één veld naar rechts. 

Dieren:

Punten = Aantal dieren op de tegel + dezelfde soort dieren in de weide.
Burcht:

Voer onmiddellijk een extra actie uit naar keuze. Dobbelsteenwaarde mag de speler zelf bepalen.

Mijn:

De speler ontvangt 1 zilverling per mijn aan het einde van een etappe.

Gebouwen: 
Zie gebouwen.
Punten:

+ De speler krijgt punten als hij een kleurgebied afsluit (volledig bezet met tegels). Hij krijgt punten afhankelijk van de grootte van het gebied (van 1 tot 36 punten) en afhankelijk van welke etappe (van 10 tot 2 punten). 

+ De speler die als eerste het laatste veld van een kleur in zijn vorstendom bezet, krijgt de grote bonuskaart. Afhankelijk van het aantal spelers krijgt hij onmiddellijk punten. De speler die als tweede het laatste veld van een kleur in zijn vorstendom bezet, krijgt de kleine bonuskaart. Hij ontvangt ook onmiddellijk de punten afhankelijk van het aantal spelers. 

+ Iedere speler ontvangt op het einde van het spel nog punten voor: iedere niet verkochte goederentegel = 1punt; iedere zilverling = 1 punt; per 2 arbeiders = 1 punt en de eigenschap van gele tegels = x-aantal punten. 

Belangrijke regels:

+ Tegel van het speelbord nemen: Als de opslagplaats van de speler vol is dan moet hij één van de tegels die daar liggen, verwijderen. 

+ Spelersvolgordespoor: Verplaatst een speler zijn pion naar een bezet veld, dan plaatst hij zijn pion op de andere pion(en). 

+ Iedere speler kan maar 3 verschillende goederen in zijn magazijn bewaren. Dezelfde goederen worden op elkaar gelegd. Kan een speler niet alle goederentegels (activatie bij een schip) in zijn magazijn opslaan, dan neemt hij enkel de goederentegels die hij wel kan opslaan. 

+ Een speler kan per arbeidersfiche de dobbelsteenwaarde met 1 verhogen of verlagen. Je kan van 6 naar 1 gaan en omgekeerd. Er mogen meerdere fiches voor één dobbelsteen gebruikt worden.

Feld's best so far. Pull tiles from a central area and then place those in the appropriate regions on your personal board. The board management makes this game stand out. Most of the scoring comes from completing those regions. Figuring out which tiles to obtain and when to obtain them so that you can complete the regions in the most optimal order makes for a stimulating game.

This game makes for an interesting use of dice.

The game would be okay if it wasn't two and a half hours, the issue is that unlike most other games in which once everyone knows what they are doing - the game goes quicker... this game: once you know what you are doing - it goes much slower, thus prolonging the game a bit too much.

I felt like the rulebook needed to have a few more pictures for setup and a bit more explanation at the beginning.  We really struggled through this our first time because of the rule book, but it was a great game.  I think if I played again, the enjoyment would exponentially increase.

A bit longer than many of the games I play with the wife, but this works great as a two player game! Clever use of dice as workers with ways to manipulate them to the numbers you want. Takes a game or two to get used to all the 'knowledge' tiles. Its great fun building up your player board. See https://dan.bravender.net/2015/10/25/A_Basic_Statistical_Analysis_of_Castles_of_Burgundy_Games_on_Yucata.html for an analysis of the strength of the various player boards.

After playing it some more over at Yucata, I guess I need to up the rating. The more I played the game, the more I saw that there's really room for clever plays and you have a lot of options to deal with the dice values that you've rolled. I just enjoy the efficiency puzzle that Burgen von Burgund is.

I took me quite some time and a lot of plays (most of them online) to come up with a rating for the Castles of Burgundy (CoB). After all this plays, I'm still not sure how to rate it. It's fun to make the best out of your dice rolls and try to pull of some nice combos with the city tiles. And while I think that CoB is a good game, something prevents it from being great, although I'm not quite sure what it is. Sometimes CoB feels just a little bit too restrictive in that there isn't really a power combo you can build and in the end, all player boards look quite similar. Well, maybe I'll figure out what bothers me later. Until then, I'll continue to play this game.

This is a provisional rating based on one play. I actually expect I might raise the rating if I played it more (I don't own it). I'm not a Feld groupie. I bought and played Roma and hated it, and have been a bit gun-shy about Feld ever since. At first glance, this has all the problems you would associate with his games: to say the theme is wafer thin is an insult to wafers, and it's really just multi-player solitaire. To add to these weaknesses, the production quality is a bit poor, with flimsy player boards and far too thin tiles with obscure symbols on them, requiring you to constantly consult the rule book. But the clever gameplay sinks its hooks into you and things move at a quick pace. I found myself engrossed in the decision-making. It's amazing to play a dice game where it doesn't feel just random. The dice rolls feel like opportunities, not constraints. Eager to try again.

RATING: 5
From the first play to the gradual unfolding of depths of strategy and possibilities, this game has been nothing but great. 

Read the rulebook once, print out this excellent single-page summary, and you'll never have to pause to look anything up again. 

http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/67400/the-castles-of-burgundy-essential-rules-and-tile

EDIT: When I wrote the above, I had played maybe a half-dozen designer board games. After going much deeper into the hobby and playing many, many games, my good opinion of CoB hasn't held up at all. The best I can say of it is that it is the most acceptable manifestation of the idea Feld now trots out every six months, albeit with a clever new pasted on mechanism.

In short, "Choose some cards, tiles or bits. Then wait to see if other matching cards, tiles, and bits come into play. If they do, you win." 

If Feld keeps this up long enough, 'pasted on mechanism' may become as much a part of game design parlance as 'pasted on theme'. 

The central idea is always the same: in the name of 'variability', only half, or less, of the components come into play in any session. The end of the game is always the equivalent of 'the flop' in Texas Hold'em, but only when the players are 'all in'. If there was some amount of game (in poker, the betting) left after the cards (tiles, cubes, bits) are revealed, it could be alright. But it's always just, "If I turn over an X I win. If it's a Y you do". 

Feld is capable of designing really innovative games like Notre Dame and The Speicherstadt. He just doesn't. I don't even look at his new games anymore.

(Other Feld games I've played that are cut from this cloth: Macao, Bora Bora, Trajan, Aquasphere, Amerigo, and especially the god-awful steaming turd Bruges.)

RATING: 8
Best Stefan Feld, I never have to re-read the rules because the board explains it all, best played with 2 players else it becomes a bit slow going depending on who you play with. Very small luck factor despite the die rolls. Very enjoyable game and pretty easy to explain even to newer players. I enjoy it every time.

RATING: 8
Excellent game.  Filled with simple to make choices that are begging for more and more optimization.   Notably absent is the famous Feld punishment mechanisms, which lends this game to a more family friendly setting.   Board and player mats look way more intimidating then what the actual game is.   Needs to see more table time.

Works fine, but is thoroughly unexciting.  Even on a puzzly euro level it just didn't grab me.  It has the added bonus of having dice, which found a way to fuck me over, despite being fairly mitigated.  Having said all that, it's not bad.  If someone suggested it, I'd probably play.

RATING: 9
This is a real thinking game, as there are always multiple paths to try, and there's a lot to keep track of.  The downside is that in a 3- or 4-player game, there can be a lot of down time while you're waiting for the rest of the players to take their turn. Get a couple players with serious AP, and the game could drag on way too long.  Fortunately for me, I got it mostly for 2-player with my wife, so we're good.  Overall, a real brain-burner.  Definitely not a filler, but a very good game for an entree.

OK, after a couple more plays, the brain burn factor has eased a bit, but it's still a thinking game, because you have to plan ahead, yet still be able to react to changing options.  This is a very cool game.

The thin cardboard pieces and length of set-up/take down keptthis from being a "10".  However, now that I have the little color-coded draw bags from the GeekStore, I might have to revisit that.

I'm not a big fan of Die Burgen von Burgund.  

There are a lot of abstract rules to learn, which means it does not stand out from among a whole slew of thinly themed Euro games.  The game seems to be balanced, and there are a lot of interesting decisions to make, but it does not have anything innovative going on, and the theme is very very thin.  For a game with this many rules (it is overwhelming to begin with), I have grown to expect something that is more thematic. 

I'm already not a big fan of Agricola because I get overwhelmed with options, but at least Agricola has a theme that I can follow.  Burgund has a overarching theme that makes sense (building an estate), but all of the actions and point structures are very abstract.

Yes, it's yet another soulless euro (YASE) but that not necessarily a bad thing when the game works great as it is. Sure the theme is pasted on but the mechanics beneath it are sound.

Probably too slow with four players. Should be better with three.

Update: Yes, too slow with four players. I almost fell asleep waiting for my turn again. Probably in the wrong mood for this game today.

Update 2: Better with three but still very little interaction.

Game, which I got a while ago, but did not play it - as there was always something more interesting to put on the table. Now I can say - i should try it earlier. It's easy to learn, hard to master. Typical, classical Feld salat. Make your way through the tiles and dice rolls in order to be the master. I have to say I like it. I am not really bothered here by lack of negative interaction. 
Game really gives a lot of joy and forces you to make the best out of your rolls. 
I am happy to see that the game is not fully deterministic and it cannot be fully calculated. If it's only released by the company, that takes care about the graphics and quality of tiles ;)

I actually enjoy playing this one and picked it up.  Surprising that I like it because it doesn't have much theme.  You select buildings from the main board.  Move them to a holding area on your board.  Then place them into your city.  The selection and placement are restricted by dice rolls and color (for placement).  So there's some luck, but it feels pretty well mitigated by taking actions that give you workers...which allow dice to be modified.

castles of Burgundy is a well balanced strategy board game that meets all my strategy needs. It has a Kingsburg dice rolling element that is much much better. It is a game that is fairly easy to learn but difficult to master. The scene is a bit dry . one of the few games out there that I played and then immediately wanted to play it again to do better the second time around. Two thumbs up.

RATING: 8
Players are medieval nobles developing their lands in Burgundy.  Mechanically simple game with a lot of pieces and options.  The game is played over 25 turns, each turn players roll two dice and "spend" them on actions.  Actions are either to draft a hex tile off a pool board, from a slot that matches a die result.  Or... they can use a previously drafted hex tile, and deploy it into their little land on a hex that matches a die result.  Alternatively they can ship goods ... that match a die result.  Finally, they can simply dump their dice and take any action ... a last resort move when there is nothing constructive to do.  Along the way, dozens of victory points are awarded for filling in areas, shipping goods, farming animals (nice tilt to Knizia's Africa there!), and acquiring end of game bonus tiles.  A very nice design that feels a little different, as usual for Feld, with absolutely no relationship of mechanics to theme at all, again as usual for Feld.  Tons of things to think about, but the rules don't get in the way of the process, usually a sign they've got it right.  Good stuff.

I really enjoy the mechanics on this one, but the components and graphic design do leave something to be desired. Some of the colours are a bit tricky for colourblind players, and with no draw bags included, there are a lot of tiny hexes that need to be shuffled in order to set this one up. The graphics seem the worst out of the recent Feld games, but I think the gameplay is up there with his best games.

This is a parody of a game. Draft things and group-solitare them on your boards. Dice as the limiting mechanism. The iconography is inscrutable, the play tedious, and the tension negligable.

Wow, what an awesome game.  Feld can go way overboard with putting too many mechanisms in a game, but he has shown nice restraint here.  I really like that your goals are clear, and the way the dice limit your choices.  However, if you are vigilant, you can set yourself up so that you can use nearly any numbers you roll.  I think the use of dice here is more successful than the attempt made with Macao.  The random tile draws add nice variability as well. 

HOWEVER, ALEA, LISTEN UP!  I have had it up to here with your shitty productions of great games.  I MIGHT be able to forgive your standard substandard tile thickness, but why oh why did you hire a camouflage expert to do the graphic design of this game?  Are you afraid of a drone attack on any pieces that are actually visible on the game board?  Designers, please start selling your best designs to other companies that know how to treat a lady!

One of my favorite euro games, and easily my favorite by Feld. I tend to prefer cards to dice as randomizers due to how cards tend to be "random opportunities" while dice tend to be "random results."

I can certainly appreciate this game being in the Top 10 as I really enjoy the mechanics, dice rolling, tile placement, powers, etc...  I think the only issue I really have is that points are awarded for soooo many actions and it feels like you always have a play to make.  For me, it makes this game feel almost too accessible (I think that can be a bad thing).  Personally, I would like to be rewarded for skillful play and not necessarily be surpassed by those who can pretty easily feast at a point buffet without much effort.  Again, though, it is a great game, but probably falls just outside of my small collection of must-haves.

Essentially, this is a tile-laying game where each player is building their own estate using their own dice to claim tiles from a central area.   The game consists of 25 turns, which is about 2-3 too many if most of the important work is finished prior, although this becomes less and less of an issue with experienced play.   The thematic integration is a little more lacking than other Feld games, but it's not a huge complaint.   There are some production issues - bad color choices/matching, thin and tiny Alea components - but these aren't game breakers either.   Turn order seems really important, much in the same way as Agricola - don't neglect it.   Works well as a "couples" game.   Like comfort food.

Eddig csak egyedül próbáltam ki, hogy milyen a játékmenet. Van min gondolkodni :). Tipikus Feld játéknak mondanám, ha játszottam volna már 3-nál többel. Alapvetően tetszett a játékmenet, jó volt, hogy egy kis gondolkodással, jó kis kombinációkat lehetett összehozni az épületlapkák segítségével, s sokféleképpen lehet benne pontot szerezni. Valamint érdemes figyelni a többiek játékára is, hogy el tudjunk orozni egy-egy nekik fontos lapkát. Azt olvastam, hogy a kockák ellenére a szerencsetényező ügyesen le van csökkentve. Valóban, hiszen a kockákat többféleképpen lehet elhasználni, viszont én azt vettem észre, hogy azért bele-beleszólt a stratégiámba. A játék nem rövid, viszont cserébe élvezetes. Az AP veszély jelen van, mert sok lehetőség közül kell kiválasztani a legideálisabbat. A játék elég jól ki van egyensúlyozva és az újrajátszhatóság is biztosított. Eurogémes családoknak egy kitűnő választás lehet. A szabály soknak tűnhet elsőre, de az első fázis végére mindenki tisztán fog látni. Kíváncsian várom, hogyan fog beválni a családon belül.

This is a GREAT game, but the potential for analysis-paralysis depending on who you are playing it with on top of the somewhat finicky non-streamlined rule subtleties, keep it from being a PERFECT game.  

During your turn you always have good options available that can score you points, but its about finding the BEST option – that is where the challenge is.  This feeling of always moving forward during every turn is an attribute I always admire in games.  And therefore, depending on who you are playing with, with so many good options to choose from, you could have a situation where players take too long to make their decision.  

Additionally, even with somewhat experienced players, there is something of a steep learning curve here for new players to absorb the rules and game play.  For one thing, it’s a very unique game and I can’t really think of any game to compare it with; new players come into the game without any frame for reference as to how the game plays out.  

I’ve heard some complaints that the rolling of the dice creates too much luck for this kind of a strategy game.  However, I feel the dice just narrows your choices down to a more manageable level and, if you build up your engine properly, keeping worker tokens in stock completely mitigates that luck.  

Its not the most streamlined set of rules by today’s standards (and learning the iconography on your individual game-board is CRUCIAL!).  Two rules that ALWAYS seemed to be overlooked is that you can’t have two of the same type of building in one area, and you can’t make more than one purchase from the center of the board, per turn.  Numerous times.  Players had to try to try to back track their turns after making such mistakes and causing other players scramble to think if they also made such mistakes.  I’m not really sure of the reason for these rules other than to make unnecessary hurdles in the game to more it more complex (I don’t see this as a balancing or run-away-leader-stopping mechanic).  There are also other little rules here and there that make the game a little finicky.  I’ve played this a few times, and in every game, were aren’t entirely sure if the final score was totally accurate.  

Oh!, and then there are the colors: it might look pretty artistically, but having three different shades of green and very muted yellows and browns for all the types of tiles was not a good idea.  I’m not sure how anyone with even the slightest color-blindness could play this this game.  You need VERY good lighting to play this game.  

Still, after a few plays, I can say I enjoy this game and would like to play it more, I’m just hesitant to throw it on the table for the reasons discussed.

Playing the game reminded me on a quote by Friedemann Friese in his Interview with Andrea "Liga" Ligabue on opinionatedgamers.com (http://opinionatedgamers.com/2011/10/16/the-art-of-design-interviews-to-game-designers-12-friedemann-friese/ ): "I want to play a new mechanism and not a new mechanism buried under 5 million ways of scoring!"

Took me forever to get a game of this in, well after the initial buzz had faded.  I can see why people were excited about it, though.  
The dice put a lot of constraints on what you can do, but you always have workers to modify them, so you can usually get what you want if you're willing to pay for it.  There are also a lot of rolls in a round if you're willing to wait.  'Course, the good stuff may be gone by then, and getting mine production set up early is kind of important.  I love the fact that there are so many different boards, just with the base game, so you always have options on where to start and what types of tiles to focus on.  
I'm not going to disagree with some of my friends who deem the game 'point salad'.  You really are rewarded for just about everything, so it can be hard to tell what to do first.  Even the games I've won, I couldn't tell you how.
Still, it's a solid midweight euro, and one I'll probably play for a while.

RATING: N/A
EXCELLENT (I mean it) catch up mechanic. Saw 2 games where the last player suddenly got on a bullet train and gained massive points during gameplay (I was the person who's leading, hence I remember this incident) and became the leader/2nd player in three quarter of the game. So, when you see a person's on the last spot, doesn't mean that he can't be the first. 

I'm familiar with Stephen Feld's design (just by a few games) and usually his design includes a disaster, huge VPs deduction or catastrophe (1. In Speicherstadt, there's fire 2. In In the Year of Dragon, there is drought etc 3. In Macao, there's crazy deduction of VPs 4. Notre Dame, there's rat/plague), but Burgundy feels different. There is no bad things happening and IMO is rather unusual for his famous signature.

The game IS prone to AP. Although you can roll you dice (you're asked to roll dice simultaneously anyway by the rulebook) and plan ahead while other players are taking their actions. Problem is things can't go according to plan when the turn finally comes to you (because players before you might grab stuff that you want).

This has become one of my favorite game from Feld's designs. It's a good two player game and scales very well with 3 and 4 too.

Similar fillings as with Macao (same author), which I very like.
This one is a little bit more complex and maybe also more challenging.

+ big random factor makes players to adjust, but is not deciding about the result
+ a lot of decisions to make
+ every game is different from another
+ satisfying struggle with limited number of everything
+ quick (can be easily played in less than 1h)

- could be too complicated for fresh players 
- not very bind to theme

RATING: 7.77
Mechanically outstanding game, but little dry for the eye. I played only 4 player games so far and only with basic player tiles, and it never finished the same way. There are always a bunch of strategies to follow while you are expanding your estate. Combos that you achieve when laying buildings are extremely important and careful planning can decide the winner in the end.

Also, this game is a perfect example how dice mechanics can be extremely elegant solution. Dice are only guiding you by limiting your options, but it doesn't have to be terminal because you can change the result on the die in many different ways. Beautiful. Lack of flavour and player interaction keeps it down from 9.

A fairly satisfying dice placement game. It boils down to filling coloured areas on your player board with the right coloured tiles and using the dice to get them. Its about as thematic as a Kandinsky painting but it is fun building your little empire and feeling clever when you work the dice manipulation well to get the right tiles at the right time. I wonder if this game would wear off rather fast for me with repeat plays though. I have little interest in the indepth strategy if its there.

RATING: 6.5
A game that is entirely about mechanics - to be honest, I had no idea what we were actually accomplishing, thematically.  This is pretty common with Feld's games.

However, this one is a lot more enjoyable as the random draw of tiles and the common board keep it replayable, preventing an "optimum strategy" with a variable turn order and people inevitably grabbing the stuff you want.

Still, while it won't enter my own collection, if someone brings it to the table, I'm more than happy to sit down and play.

EDIT: After a few more plays, I've had to lower my score.  While the overall impression is still the same, I find that the only reason to have other people at the table is simply so they can bung up your plans.  While I won't say no to a game, on principle, I simply can't rate it as high as it previously was if only because there's little social aspect to the game, and I love this hobby for that specific reason.

This game is great for 2 players. The dice mechanics for this game are very clever; you can be productive with every roll. This is a game of planning and organization. You'll need the rule book for the first one or two plays, but after that the game board cheat sheets should suffice. I highly recommend this game for anyone looking for a new euro game with a lower luck element.

Once you realize that the first thirty minutes you spent stacking and placing chits wasn't the actual game, you're in for a real treat.  If you like this game, get a Plan-O box or spice boxes to reduce setup time by 80%.  Castles is all about setting up your kingdom (tableau) to chain monster point combos at the drop of a tile.  Everything else is just side dressing.  Pretty good game, but the component design is pretty poor - extremely smal pieces and washed out colors.  I also feel Ora et Labora and Suburbia (especially Suburbia) do it better (at least for me) and in a graphically superior manner.  After playing those two games, castles stopped really igniting my gaming spark.  I still enjoy playing it, I just don't get fired up about it.

I played four player game of this that took three hours - it was a trudge.  It may have been the players and not the game though...

Mechanically, its quite good. But the knowledge and building tiles rely on unique symbolism. Even veteran players are probably going to consult the rulebook 4-5 times a game to figure out what certain tiles do. Really fiddly and you'll constantly be pulled out of the game. I recommend some kind of custom storage solution to speed up setup, which you'll redo do each round. I'll also add that the components feel really thin and cheap.

Unpopular opinion, but I think a lot of superior euros have been released since COB came out.

Very good euro game with tons of strategies to explore. It's a game that is easy to get to the table and is enjoyed by most. Loses a couple of points because of lack of interactivity between players and quite ugly graphic design. But definitely deserves it's spot high on the list.

CoB was my second Feld game and it's really good, very well suited to 2 players and also very good for 3.  It makes clever use of dice to limit options but manages to be mostly about skill rather than luck.  I've liked it from the start but it's continued to grow on me to the point that it's now my favourite Stefan Feld design, getting its nose in front of Notre Dame.  My wife is the family champion with this one so she especially loves it.

A balanced euro with many possible routes to victory, all possible depending on the luck of the dice or through careful mitigation of that luck. Players build chains of tiles that work together to increase scoring potential, but it all feels so isolated from anyone else. I'm a fan of Feld games but cannot understand the high praise for this one, it's just OK. The board looks kind of silly when playing with only two.

A very pleasant game to play as a couple.  Scales well to 3 or 4 players, but its sweet spot is with 2 players.  Many approaches available to win which makes every game unique.

I can't decide which is better CoB or Trajan. I definitely feel both games are Feld's best work. CoB is very interesting each play and doesn't grow stale thanks to the variable setup and the different styles of play available. And even when I think I've grown sick of the game and take a long break between plays it always is fun to play when it makes it back to the table.

Upon reading the rules to Castles of Burgundy I was immediately impressed by all of the interlocking systems of scoring.  I also liked that you wouldn't see every tile in a given game as this tends to increase replayability.  In fact, I was even thinking that this game could be potentially better than Troyes, due to the fact that there is a spacial element in the game and the fact that rolling high really isn't better than rolling low, it's just a matter of what number you need.  In Troyes, you generally want to roll a high number of pips to allow a card to be activated more times.  Low rolls can still be useful (Cathedral + Building Placement) but high rolls are generally better.  Well, after my first game of Burgundy, I can confidently say that I don't find it as enjoyable as Troyes. I felt more screwed by the dice in this game than Troyes as you'll typically want a specific number and you might not be able to mitigate the luck of the die.

The game is easy, for 25 rounds (broken up into 5 phases), you'll roll two dice and use those dice to do 2 actions of the following actions: (1) Add tiles from the main board to a 3-space docking station, (2) Place tiles from your docking station to your board, (3) Sell a good for VP and money, (4) Gain workers which mitigate the luck of the dice.  You have many different tiles that do different things when added to your board from the docking area: (1) Ships: Increase in Turn Order + Gain Goods, (2) Mines: Gives you money, (3) Castles: Allows you to do an extra action with a virtual die of any result, (4) Buildings: One-Shot benefits of varying types, (5) Knowledge: End of Game VP scoring and persistent special abilities, (6) Pastures: Points which increase the more you specialize in a single animal type.  Though diversifying your animals is useful through knowledge tiles.

Overall, I enjoyed the first half of the game, but felt it kind of dragged in the latter half.  The only real problem I had with the game is that if felt too long.  Our 3-player game only ended up being about 2-ish hours which I'm told was pretty good pacing.  It felt longer than 2 hours to me.  While I can see how the game tries to increase replay value (ie not seeing all the tiles, different board layouts, acquiring different knowledge tiles each game) it seems like the game will eventually feel repetitive.  Maybe repetitive is the wrong word.  Maybe lacking in a narrative arc.  In Troyes, games can feel vastly different due to the events and activity cards... you can have low money games, low influence games, games where you have to combat a lot of dice.  The plays just feel a lot more unique.  I think in Burgundy, you'll do some different things each game, but it will mostly just feel like you're doing them in different order.  I also wasn't fond of how you just seem to get points for doing anything which ends up having scores above 200 but still relatively close among all players.  It's good in that, you can't 100% tell who is in the lead but it also makes you wonder how you could have improved your game.  I think it's pretty good but Troyes is still the definitive dice-rolling Euro. Also, I now feel this game has been replaced by Grand Austria Hotel.

Edit: I only play this as a 2-player game. Other minor issues have surfaced for me.

I get so much satisfaction at the end of the game when I look at my kingdom that I have created on my player board! This is a great two-player game and scales well with three and four players. Because there are SO MANY icons on the board, it can seem a little overwhelming at first, but they all make sense so once you learn them the game goes quickly. I really enjoy the diversity that the game provides through rolling dice, taking actions based on the rolls, and stacking actions together with the buildings you place on your player board. Don't like dice? Think dice hate you? I've heard a number of people with those same thoughts say that they like this game and that the dice rolling aspect is an interesting action mechanic.

It is not pretty looking, but it is very enjoyable, and the dice are implemented in a compelling way. Player interaction is limited, and downtime can be a bit of an issue, but the total game length is nice overall.

Good with 2 players and can be found for cheap. Bland with smooth play, but I'm not sure if it's compelling enough for me to own. The tiles hard to read due to small icons and similar colors. Optimal choices seemed very obvious, points come easily, and it overstays its welcome about 1 round too long. Overall, this game reminds me of a doting grandma...pleasant and always wants you to feel like you are doing well, but not terribly exciting. If you like your games to feel like some nice cookies while you do a simple jigsaw puzzle with mee-maw, then this would be a good option. While I enjoyed it well enough, there are just other games I'd rather play.

An excellent game that works well with two players.  It's a little fiddly, but I think it will come together with more plays.  There is a lot to pay attention to, with a number of different tiles that perform different functions.  It might seem luck-driven, given the role of the dice, but when I can't do anything, I always feel its the choices I made, not the dice rolls that I could've anticipated, that have caused me problems. (An awesome gift from Secret Santa 2012).

The Castles of Burgandy takes the recent trend of dice driving your decisions to an extreme. Although you have a limit of choices, Castles of Burgandy still offers an incredible amount of choices. Personally, I found the choices even more numerous and complicated than say Agricola or Troyes. 

The amount of choices comes with a price though. The result is that the game is one of small increments. You will rarely have a choice that really changes the entire scope of the game. If you are like me, and enjoy games of nickels and dimes, games of small increments, this is a goodie. 

My favorite element of the design of dBvB is the value of the dice roll - a six is no more valuable than a one. 

Also the board and tableaus are ugly, real ugly. They are pretty functional though.

The game gets a lot more interesting when you start using the different boards.

A fun game. Even though it is point salad the game brings much enjoyment. Very clean, tactile, super fun getting exponential animal points and combos. Well designed except... What it suffers from is the dice mechanics. They serve to inject a feeling of frustration now and again, especially when you roll doubles. Such is my most hated gripe in the hobby. Not as bad as Catan and at least I actually enjoy this game.

Ok game (no major flaws) but too long with 4 players. The game is a little abstract and bland so I wouldn't want the game to drag on, which it does. The dice is fun but the whole mechanism is actually quite superfluous. It doesn't cut down on the AP anyway and an action point system mght have made the game more strategic.

* Game flows smoothly with "elegant" feel. Every piece of it seems to fit together perfectly.
* Plays great with 2 players and is a favorite of my wife and I.
* Lots of ways to earn points but can feel like "point salad" where your decisions aren't always critical to the outcome.

[2 plays] I wanted to like this better but I'm just not sure I do.  Normally a game about France starts out ahead in my book, but the theme here is pretty weak.  It could have been done better. And somehow there's a lot of "I have a plan!  Oh no, the player to my left took the thing I wanted. OK, I'll go to plan B. Oh no, now the player across took that! Must come up with plan C. Oh no, now the player to my right has cut me off! What could plan D possibly be???"   
The other all-too-frequently-realized scenario is "I have a plan and no one can interfere with it.  Wait five minutes for player to my left to figure out what they want.  Wait five minutes for player across to make up his mind.  Wait five minutes for player to my right to re-plan his turn which has been ruined by the others.  Finally my turn!  Take 10 seconds to do the actions I planned 15 minutes ago.  Lather, rinse, repeat."

I opened and punched it, then read the rules. Seems very dry and fiddly.  There are too many things to remember.  Plus it's another one of those games where each turn, you have to go through all your yellow tiles to remember which bonuses you get and optimize the order in which to play them.

Wow! A relatively easy game to learn that's packed with tough decisions.

A highly addictive and satisfying dice assigning tile placement game where you can make combo chains eg. place a city hall to place a mine which lets you grab a castle, then place the castle to place a carpenter's and grab another building from the market...WHEW! If you can get all that to work the game is incredibly fun. You can use your dice and some special tiles to allow you to modify your dice rolls so you are not so much luck dependent on the dice. I've played 2 and 3 player and I like it best at 2 where you have more control over the turn order (and therefore the market) to a certain extent. A really great game that deserves its high ranking status.

Fun and fast-paced Euro with a lot of variety. Really like the way the dice are used. Presentation could be much prettier, but it's functional. A lot of stuff is done with icons and even though the player board does a good job of helping you with those, having the manual ready is still pretty much a must for the yellow joker tiles.

The only real drawbacks are that the game is rather light on theme and that it's fiddly because it has so many tokens of different kinds that have to be refilled each round.

A classic. This is a go-to game when we don't feel like a long setup and want a relatively quick but also deep game. Dice games are where its at and this game uses them beautifully. Players get two dice which they use to place on the board in various locations. Dice can be manipulated by worker tokens which is a nice twist to the game. Because of the scarce token types and limited availability on the board, the game can get very passive aggressive and tense. There luck in the dice rolls and token availability creates some nice drama too.

Too long? One comment I found: "The box optimistically says 60-90 minutes; expect your first game of 4 to go about 120-150 minutes."

Like Macao it has dice but is simpler.  Mostly multi-player solitaire.  Recommended with 2 or 3 players, less so with 4 (otherwise too much down time and too long a game), some still consider it too long.  Merely average components, fairly dry with very pasted on theme, fairly multi-player solitaire, prone to AP for optimizers due to overwhelming options?

Also owned: [gameid=110926] (from Spielbox).  Important clarification about the new rule [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/7736940#7736940]here[/url].

I love how every round feels like its own puzzle, where you work to get everything done that you need and still be ready to come out swinging in the next round. I also love the ways that you can mitigate your bad rolls to still accomplish something good. The variety of "point salad" strategies which you must adapt to depending on the random tiles that come out makes the game interesting every time. Shame the art & components are lackluster, but I guess that's the sacrifice for getting so much game for just over $25.

This is one of those euros that I liked for a few plays but then suddenly my interest dried up. I think that’s simply the case for some euros, especially Feld designs. They’re fun for a while but don’t hold interest beyond a handful of plays. I can’t help but compare this to Troyes which is a game I still enjoy after a dozen plays. 

Unlike the forced dice selling in Troyes, there's little to no element of anticipating other player's moves which turns it into a solo optimization puzzle and removes a lot of the tension. You might take tiles away from each other in the market but for the most part, you do your own thing without intentionally affecting other players. And you do your own thing over and over without a feeling of an arc. After a while you total up the points and find you’re all within 10 points of each other.

Looks good as a heavy 2 player option. Will test that thesis in 2014.

Update: After a couple more plays I'm developing a feel for the game. It's the third Feld I've played (Bora Bora and Notre Dame being the other two) and I think Burgundy is my favourite. 

The theme is weak, which matters for me, but I do like that it plays in an hour or so and works very well with 2 players.

There is an interesting analysis of average scores for each of the player boards on BGG that's worth looking into.

Really can't go wrong with a Stefan Feld design.  I'm a fan of games that use dice as your worker mechanics (i.e. Kingsburg) and although I do have a minor issue with the color scheme (yellow green, light green, dark green for 3 of the areas), this game just seems to fire on all cylinders.  I like that even on the base boards, there are several strategies you can go for and when you are ready for something else, there are plenty of different boards to try out.  I also like how much the technologies can influence the course of game.

Shared auction constrained by dice rolls, but modified by meta tiles, makes for a good amount of interaction with other players, plus different routes to VP in building (completing one color, getting more buildings of a certain kind, filling out the pastures with animals).  There is good mix of resource constraints (e.g. goods, money, dice-mode workers, resource tiles) to make it interesting without getting bogged down.

Nice mix of map building and resource allocation.

Its been 5 years since my last game and it still plays great as a 'score the most points' by manipulating dice rolls to buy and place tiles and sell goods.

RATING: 7
Good game. I still think the goods portion of the game feels clunky, yet in the two games I've played I've ignored them at my peril as the winner ended up shipping a lot and grabbing bonus tiles for shipped goods.

My biggest complaint is that the building tiles are not very distinguishable from each other and unless you play it a lot you are perpetually looking up what the hell each building is and what it does. Needs a big UI fix there. How about put the name of the damned building on each tile?

I Really enjoy this game and want to play again. 

The dice mechanism is interesting in the way it defines/limits your options on what you can do from turn to turn. It means you have to adjust your goals through the game. I rated it an 8 initially. So far scores have been reasonably even, but there seems to be a fair amount of depth to it.

Rating after one game (four player). Keen to play more.   Post game downloaded the play aid from here which is far superior to what is with the game.  Described to me as "solo economic system game where the only player interaction is if a tile you want is chosen before you get it", which I would agree with.  Presentation wise a feeling that tiles need to be 50% bigger than they are for easy analysis.  For the first few games then anyone with experience of this (and the tiles) should be walking over newcomers.  Whilst dice results can be modified, a slight niggling feeling that rolling what you need when you need it will tip the game in your favour (or at least that the opposite will cause you to lag).  Lost my first game badly because of lack of information on tile options and stalled on the economic system.

It's a multi-player solitaire with the only interaction being choice denial by taking something that another wants. But with 25 turns, it's not often you have nothing reasonable to do, and it's OK for what it is. You only need to learn the special abilities of the buildings and knowledge, and then chunter through the game. Running out of money is bad, but running out of workers is badder. It's a reasonably tight, well balanced game with a distinct lack of fun.

This game is a lot of fun. The dice makes you originally think that a lot of luck is involved but really the dice hardly affect the outcome of the game.

Fantastic and fun!!  Another Feld favorite!  This guy is on fire with his designs.  Amazing design with lots of agonizing choices.  Like Trajan, this game is a "scorefest" with so many paths and options to take.  The variety of player boards greatly changes the flavor of the game (and each player's strategy).  Also, features another use of his clever mechanisms.  His use for dice, in particular, is often some of Feld's strongest points.

I can't get enough of his games, and always eager to play.  Castles of Burgundy remains in Feld's "Top Tier" masterpieces.  Bravo, Feld!  Grade: A+

2p - 5 - excellent short 2p game
3p - 2 - not better than 2p, just longer

Nov 2016: The systems are clever, but the game is quite abstract. The shipping feels tacked on to boot. But my real objection is elsewhere. This game is one more euro-with-a-brown-and-green-palette. Middle-ages Europe. White people building things. So many games are now coming out that offer us something different setting-wise, as well as vibrant art, and clear iconography. Setting matters to me to a point, but visual design is a big part of my enjoyment of games, and this game lacks it. That drab, muddled presentation on top of a very gamey Feldian game - no matter how clever - just leaves me cold these days. Clever, but ultimately not that fun after the initial joy of playing with a clever system. 

July 2014: For years I've seen photos of this game and thought "Meh." But that ranking is so high...? So I finally borrowed a copy and sat down to play. Finally a Feld I really love. Don't get me wrong, this game is PURE euro all the way - abstract point-salad from start to finish - but it plays in THIRTY MINUTES with 2p. THIRTY. And in that thirty minutes you are acquiring and selling goods, acquiring and laying tiles, acquiring with bonuses in mind, prioritizing and re-prioritizing with every acquisition your opponent makes... Whew! All of this in THIRTY minutes. And THAT is (in my opinion) why this game is so good. NO game offers this much gameplay in such a short amount of time.

Well done, Herr Feld. Well done.

5th play: 8. SEP/14. Just as fun as I remembered from a few months ago. Glad I purchased it.

10th play: 9. SEP/14. Seems to float between 8 and 9 depending on my mood for euros. Still challenging with every play.

This game fires:
...Attika, as a 2p tile-laying/expand-territory game
...Ticket to Ride as a short light-middleweight

After a second play I find this really dull.  I'm not playing 'an aristocrat, controlling a small princedom trying to build settlements and castles, trade along the river...', I'm rolling a die and then either grabbing a tile, playing a tile, or flipping over some tiles.

There is only the thinest veneer of a theme here.

Overall, I liked this better than I thought I would in that I didn't hate it.  Ended up winning 214-213-189.  The mechanics all work together, and while at first it seems like there is a lot, they flow pretty smoothly.

However, now that I've played it twice, I don't feel like I need to play it anymore as it is a little boring.  It doesn't feel like I'm really 'doing' anything, I'm just grabbing tiles to drop on my player board.

Bad color choice: 4 shades of green, one of which is actually yellow.

Flimsy cardboard, little icons.

The game has more strategic qualities in 4p (all of the tiles are in the game), but then it becomes AP-prone, slow, with lots of downtime. (playing time around 3hrs)

In 2p has a reasonable playing time, but a random half of the tiles will not get drawn. So more tactic than strategic.

Totally dry of theme, no story to be told, nor a narrative arc: the last turns are the most dull of the game.

The players will end with around 200 points each, with a small difference, that makes me think that the skill factor is actually more a luck factor of getting the right dice at the right moment, or not losing a good move at the wrong moment. Being in the game 50 actions, everybody can make mistakes.

Not for me.

Unfortunately, for me this game is deeply unsatisfying.

Certainly the game is rather clever: even though what you can do depends on the dice you roll, you have the ability to change your dice's values; whatever crap you roll, you can still do something that feels like an achievement (the fact that doing anything scores you points helps too). This is probably one of the reasons this game is often praised.

But to me it feels too scripted. Being able to easily influence your dice means both making luck less important and being able to push most games into the same path. This can be good with games where you have an overwhelming number of choices (like Go, Race for the Galaxy, Napoleon's Triumph), but here I feel like my choices aren't interesting and varied enough.

The ultimate "use your dice to select actions" game IMHO. An amazing puzzle-like experience that plays best with 2 or 3 and may be my favorite game to play alone with the spouse. It's like a game of basketball in that it's high scoring and scores will typically be pretty close, which may be a turn-off for some. Cons: Setup and take-down time is steep and the insert could have used more small compartments. Player interaction is on the low side, but there's so much to think about that I mind even less than usual.  Pros: Plays in about 30-minutes per player, and gives the perfect blend of dice constraining one's choices while still offering many tactical and even strategic decisions.  The basic rules are very simple with the rules complexity coming from the abilities and uses of the many various tile types.  It feels like a race and you'll never get everything done that you want to in the time that you have. If you like strategic, puzzle-like games with a small dose of dice luck and you don't mind games with only indirect player interaction, I highly recommend it!

Really nice game, lovely to play a dice game where low numbers aren't bad.

By about the 3rd or 4th round, the children both had got the hang of pre-planning their moves, so things started to flow.

Owning many other Feld titles already I had high hopes for this one and it didn't disappoint!  I love the dice action mechanism and the ability to change the dice values with worker tiles.

If I can find any fault with the game then it is the lack of theme.  As a Francophile who travels France several times a year and loves the castle regions such the The Loire, I was disappointed that the theme did not fit the mechanism.

I was lucky enough to play the upcoming new Alea game "Burgen von Burgund" (by Stefan Feld) 3 times over the last couple of days.
Apart from some tweaking of the pictography the game's rules were supposedly in the final version.
I have to admit that it has been a long time since I have really been enthused by an Alea game ("In the year of the Dragon" being the last one I considered as really great ) the  ones after that I though were more or less average. 
But this one is again what I would consider as a great game which I will definetly buy once it's pubished  in Germany in Jan 2011.

After five plays, really enjoying this one. At first I thought it would be just another dry tile-placing Euro. But there's a lot more than meets the eye. A lot of different strategies, several different player boards to choose from, and a large variety of tiles to go for really make this one shine. Replayability is very solid. It does take a long time to play--even with just two players, our play time is an hour and ten minutes, and that doesn't include set up and tear down--which can also be cumbersome. But looking past that, there's a fantastic game here.

Wanted to like this. The game itself is good - a clever balance between tactics and strategy - if not particularly exciting. Unfortunately almost every aspect of the theme and presentation is just plain awful. Being a fan of games like Suburbia and 7 Wonders I love building my own little kingdoms, but here the tiles are so small and fiddly, the board much too busy, the symbols often unhelpful, and the colours so dreary. I wouldn't turn down a game but didn't feel the need to hold onto it and won't mind if I don't revisit it. I don't understand why this is quite so highly rated.

I'm in love with Stefan Feld's designs, because they are elegant instead of fiddly. This one is my present favourite Feld board-game (I also have Roma and In the year of the dragon). The inteligent use of dice makes this game one to be put on a "category" we could name: "Dice that aren't dice", where I would also includ Troyes and Roma.
There's a lot of paths to victory in this game, and the desitions to be made are too many and so variable! Nevertheless, the game mechanics are so pure, simple, brilliant and elegant that you'll never feel numb or lost... or confused.
The playing time is another succes of Castles of Burgundy, 'cause it can be played in the half (or less than the half) of the time required to play other "Great Euro-Titles" such as Puerto Rico and Agricola.
The one and only issue I have with this game is the quality of its components: the player boards are very thin, as all the cardboard pieces. They should have made this piece of art with the quality it deserves, but they haven't. Well, at least its price is not expensive at all, and corresponds perfectly to what comes inside the box.
I give this one, at least for now, a complete 10.

Kicsit csúnyácska, de jó játék. Az előzetesen hallottak alapján féltem tőle, hogy nagyon agyzsibbasztó és hosszadalmas játék lesz, de egyáltalán nem az. Max közepesen nehéz játék, nagyjából átlagos játékidővel.
Ötletes megoldások vannak benne, bár szinte minddel találkoztam más-más játékokban, amik azonban simán lehet, hogy újabbak, mint ez.
Szívesen játszom még vele, hátha átlépi a bűvös nyolcas határt is az értékelésem.

Die Burgen von Burgund is another game that jumps on the 'dice are nice' bandwagon. Here, they are only used to restrict the action choices available to the players. There is nothing particularly new or innovative about that, and the impact of the dice is reduced even further because there are ways to modify the results. In short, you might say that the description of BvB as a dice game is somewhat misleading.

What remains is a fairly generic point conversion game with a light engine-building aspect. You grab tiles from a common pool, then place them on your own board to gain improvements for future actions, trigger special actions, or score points. While there are a few strategic considerations most of the game is very tactical in nature because even more than on the dice results you depend on the right tiles coming up (and nobody else snagging them up before you do).

I can understand those who say it's repetitive to some extent; the variance in possible actions is fairly small, and their nature or impact doesn't change too much from the first to the last round. Nevertheless the tactical considerations are usually interesting enough, and a little advance planning can keep things open enough that you rarely get stuck with results that aren't useful at all.

CoB is supposed to be a strategic game. You make strategic choices. However, if each player would be allowed to make any choice that he wants, the game would not be interesting at all since it is relatively painless to identify the best choices. Therefore, designer Feld introduced dice: you can only make the choices that you want if you manage to roll the numbers of those choices. Translated: CoB is a game where the strategies are so straightforward that it needs randomness in choices to gain interest. When I say that, people tell me that you can compensate for the randomness by buying workers, but that makes it even worse: the designer KNOWS that his design is too random to be of interest, so he introduces a mechanism that allows a player to compensate for the stupid design and make it less random! Sorry, I rather play a game in which the strategies of players are pitted against each other rather than against rolling dice.

Typical Euro in a number of ways, but definitely feels different than other games that I've played.  CoB makes for a nice 2-player game, but also plays well with any amount (though it gets longer with every player). I really enjoy this game. Similar sort of idea to Feld's first game, Roma, where very few dice dictate the actions you can take. Of course, CoB has a lot more options than Roma. Has a nice progressive feel to it, which always helps with my appreciation for a Euro (to avoid that rinse-and-repeat feel that can happen). Still might go on a little too long, but it ain't too bad.

This is an excellent game. Excellent! It's dice driven all the way, but what makes it unique is the way the dice are used to do things in the game. Using worker chits (earned by spending dice) can change the outcome of the dice. So can certain knowledge tiles. You get to build your own little kingdoms on your own play mat with tiles you can buy with your dice. Victory points are earned by filling up regions, selling goods, or earning silverlings. silverlings can be used to purchase special tiles from a central bank. The game plays in 5 phases with 5 rounds each. It takes a while to play, but every round in a phase is a lot of decisions and routes to victory. You might think you're going to lose, and then suddenly you're in the lead.

Quite enjoyable and quick playing when you know what you're doing but sometimes the luck of the roll will just screw you over and there's nothing you can do about it.

This is the first Stefan Feld game I've really liked. I like that there are shared actions to choose from, but not so few that other people take all the good ones. I like that there are lots of things you can be working on that will give you points in the end. It has the Zynga effect, where whether you're doing well or not you're constantly rewarded with points for achieving small goals, so people rarely do really badly and have a bad time. I like that there are variant maps. I'll have to try the solitaire version, because I think it will be better with fewer players.

Awesome worker placement / empire building game. Lots of options and different ways to win. Different board layouts and random knowledge tiles ensure great replayability. I especially like how many ways the dice can be used. This game along with Troyes are now my favorite "dice" games :-)

Feld is the master of incorporating randomness alongside strategy, while forcing tactical flexibility. That said, there is plenty of luck mitigation here, and interesting "push your luck" interaction between players going for various tiles on the board. No wonder why this one is ranked as Feld's best to date!

RATING: 9
One of Stefan Feld best games, if not the best.

Simple actions of rolling 2 dice and determining where to allocate them for actions. But with just 2 actions, you can setup and combo to do so much more

The art/theme is a bit bland but the game play is so elegant in this game. RNG from dice is not a problem at all, it's a challenge to figure out how to best utilize what is given to you.

Plays great at all counts

The game itself is quite good. Fast, with nice dice-action mechanic. But components look awful. The worst board, tiles and everything I saw. How is it possible to publish such an ugly thing? Strange colours (without contrast) make it hard to play. Difficult to note.

acho o jogo bastante bem conseguido e funciona bastante bem a 2, acho o sistema de pontuação terrível, pontos por tudo e mais alguma coisa, é impossível de controlar a pontuação do adversário.

Classic example of "don't judge a book by its cover". The art and general material quality of this game is poor-to-horrendous, but this is one of my favorite games of all time.

It's a rare strategically deep game that plays equally well with all player counts and doesn't end up taking 2+ hours.

Some folks will see its weak theming and limited player interactivity and hold it up as a prototypical dull Euro, but it really is so much more. 

Simple a fantastic game.

RATING: 7.5
Very fiddly.  Avoid if you require theme--there's just a whiff of it here.  This is a bit like worker placement with dice--instead of just looking at everything available at the beginning of the phase and deciding what you would choose first, second, third--take what you like from what was left when you actually got to pick--this game adds two dice which limit which things you really have access to on your turn.  To compensate for this, the game gives liberal die mods so you can typically achieve your second or at worst third choice when the heartless bastard ahead of you takes the tile you wanted most.

Have played with my wife several times and we both greatly enjoy it. The gameplay and mechanics are quite simple and easy to grasp, however there's a variety of different things to do and strategies to employ depending on the tiles that come out and the dice that are rolled. Great game overall, would love to get this out and played more often.

Extremely enjoyable experience.
Not a lot of things to strategize - there are some great combinations that are surely better than the others (castle - building adding tile on the domain, third one adding lets say something to your waiting room).
Has some far similarities with... Dominion? :)
The only problem are the icons - what does this building with blue top do?

Soon as I played this, I just knew it was going to be a classic. Everything just clicks together so well and once the effects of the yellow tiles becomes familiar it plays very fluidly.

RATING: 6
This could be a better game. There are three reasons I docked points:

1) too much looking up "what does this building do again?"

2) colors that are way too similar; I don't even have color blindness and I strained at times to distinguish between them

3) no player interaction! Well, barely any. Toward the ends of rounds you end up racing for the last of resources that are running out. But there's zero direction interaction, so I become become when it's not my turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Plenty of things going on, lots to keep track of, games go by quickly and I have a good time, and yet... not something I long to play. It is a classic point salad, but I guess that's to be expected of Feld. It's missing enough flavor for me to opt for something else, usually. The components are not the best, pretty bland--the boards feel flimsy, and the art is uninspiring. All of which means the total experience for me is a mediocre one. Will play it if someone pulls it out, but not something I'll hold on to or suggest.

Wife enjoyed it, though!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
One of the overall greatest Feld games. It's bound to please the majority of folks, since it's an easy game to get into, but rewards good planning around the die rolls. All in all a very enjoyable family and gamer game. The only niggle would be about how some of the buildings are a bit difficult to make out unless one playing in a well lit area- some colors mesh. Components are simply ok, compared to the quality of some of his other games.

Great with 2. Love the point salad, many routes to victory.    Greatly reduced set up time by separating tile types into 3.5 inch square cardboard jewelry boxes from craft section at Walmart.  12 boxes fit perfectly inside the game box with room for player boards and instructions on top. Open jewelry boxes with tiles sit beside the board while playing for easy access and refilling the board between phases.

I bought this specifically for playing with my husband. I think it will be good. It's fairly strategic and has interesting choices, and I like that the flow of the game isn't overly interrupted by points calculations.  Also, there's almost no waiting time between turns.  I could see enjoying this more and more as we play it.  It wasn't terribly hard to learn, and has multiple paths to winning, and seems fairly quick to get through a game.

Excellent strategy board game, interesting use of dice to restrict choices - but even then you are faced with many different paths to take each turn.

A fun area development/resource maximisation, set collection game with some manageable randomness. Your workers are 2 dice that will dictate what actions you may take each turn however the dice are able to be manipulated. Additional randomness comes from the selection of the tiles that are available each round but with 5 turns per round and 5 rounds you have adequate time to plan within the options available. Components are good if not outstanding and the colours are somewhat muted and pastel but the iconography works well. Very good.

I haven't played a ton of Felds (just Trajan, Bruges, CoB), but this one seams to be his best - it's streamlined, quick, but full of meaty decisions. I love Trajan but the mini-games feel a little clunky, whereas the action selection in CoB is elegant and smooth.

A great game. I played it once and was only lightly impressed. However, it grew in my esteem in my memory, despite some mediocre reviews. After a year or so, I pulled the trigger and bought it and I was right! It's a great game, works wonderfully with 2 players, but it's even better with 3 (it suffers a little with 4). The dice are highly manoeuvrable, thus I rarely lose a game "because of luck", yet being dice they influence your actions, providing an ever-changing experience.

The 8 would be higher but it's not the kind of game I would "always" play (sometimes I need something more thematic).

Best Feld game along with In the year of the dragon, this is a fantastic game an so far the best 2011 design I have played. I love the simplicity of its mechanics that covers quite many tactical options and way more interaction that one could think exists at first glance. In my humble opinion this game must be in the top 100 ranking in the boardgamegeek, otherwise users will be unfair with it. It reminds a little bit some Macao mechanics, but this one is clever and flows in a better pace. A/P players could drag out a little bit and it lacks any theme, but still, a top game. No doubt. (The game eventually made it to the top 100, a position it deserves).

I don't get why this is such a big deal, for me it's JASE, but exceptionally ugly. I like the speed of play and I like the simple rules, but I don't like the dice and I don't feel particularly accomplished once I've filled in an area. When I don't roll what I need I feel frustrated and when I roll what I need I feel lucky instead of accomplished. I never feel like I fought hard to fill in an area, I just feel like the dice just happened to allow it. My big issue is that even though there's plenty of dice manipulation and strategic planning that goes into every placed tile, I can't bring myself to see that when a plan finally comes together, which makes the game extremely unrewarding. I think it's because you only have 2 dice each turn, the game would play roughly the same if you had 4 dice every turn and there were half as many turns, but I think it would feel better in my head. An "optimal" turn in this game would be to pick up a tile and place it with your 2 dice, but just placing 1 tile on your turn doesn't feel good to me.

By far and away my favorite Stefan Feld game.  Excellent, excellent, game, and I really wish I had gotten it earlier.

Variable boards really do change up what you can/should do.  

My only gripe, and it's sounds like it's a number of people's, is the quality of components.  This really is at the bottom end in terms of components though, which is too bad.  If any game deserves a nicer edition, it's this one. Aside from being thin, cheaper stuff, I am always having to squint or take a second look at which building is which.  Not a huge deal, but could be much better, especially with where our standards have gotten now.

Played this for the first time today.  It's like a nice mix of Glen More, Carcassonne, and Troyes.  We made a few mistakes, but nothing major.  All in all a very pleasant first experience, considering that most first experiences in learning a new game are miserable.  This game's already fun, and my wife says: "See, it's not that Troyes lacks theme.  This game doesn't have a really great theme, but I still had fun...so the problem with Troyes is something else.  I'd play this any day over Troyes."  She beat me twice the first day we played.  :)

UPDATE:  we rushed through a game and it sorta revealed the dryness to me.  I wouldn't recommend rushing. It feels very solitaire and robotic and mathematical that way.  We've played it a couple times since then but I'm starting to think Feld is too dry for my tastes. (this is my first Feld game).

UPDATE: we played a few more games and overall it felt like I was just going through the motions.  "Everything is made up and the points don't matter" kept coming to mind.  The point salad and that the game is designed to be so tight in scoring kinda make it feel like my actions are worthless, as if I'm playing a very elaborate version of a roll and move game.  We fell out of love with this one rather quickly and I've put it up for sale/trade.

UPDATE:  It's been awhile.  It didn't sell, so I decided to keep it.  It sits in a nice sweet spot for duration/weight that we've been looking for.  It's still ugly as sin and dryer than other Euros we have, but it works for what it is.

UPDATE: we gave this game a few more chances, but for the amount of time it takes to play, it's just not exciting, and the point salad isn't our cup of tea.  I never get the feeling that I can think of anything I could have done better to score more points.  It just ends up feeling lucky, dry, uneventful, and mediocre compared to the quality of entertainment I get out of other games I have.  It's up for trade or sale or to whoever wants it.

Pure masterpiece. Unique mechanics and many choices makes The Castles of Burgundy perfect strategy board game. Despite strategical depth, this game is light enough and plays in 1-2 hours, sometimes even less than hour and offers much fun in that short period of time. Components and theme is not the strongest side of this game, however the game play is so fun, that this proves again, that idea, mechanics and game design makes the game, not the theme, story or art. Those are just minor things and this game could even have zero theme, it would be fun anyway.

RATING: 7.5
Components: ok, could be better, but they could also be worse
Complex: easy to teach and start playing inmediately
Weight: medium to light
Players: works well with 2 to 4, will say 4 as all tiles are in play
Length: no more than 90 mins with 4 players
Mechanics: dice rolling, tile placing, set collection...
Decisions: quite a lot, you roll dice for your actions but have to adapt yourself to everything
Opinion: one of my favorite medium to light games, and one that works well with 2 to 4 players, would say that 4 is the best number, but only because all tiles are in play.
Here you have to build your kingdom with 6 different types of tiles, and in order to do so you roll 2 dice each turn and do actions according to them. One important thing, the dice can be modified with workers, and some tiles offer you bonuses to the dice as well, therefore we could say there is luck, but you cannot loose due to lack of luck.
And depending on the tiles you will get different bonuses (buildings with special actions, yellows with special abilities, green with animals, ....) and you get points for sooo many things (hello Point salad), but the game plays so smoothly and fast that it's a joy.
In a nutshell, this is a game that come to the table quite often due to the simplicity and the length of the games, but you will enjoy each play, each decision and each final score

This game was great.  A bit of an almost solitaire feel, with interactions being the use of a pool before the other player can use it.  Excellent game though, I really enjoyed the long term planning of this title.

This game is wonderful. Building your estate is a lot of fun and the variety of actions you can take leads to interesting decisions. And bad rolls aren't as damaging as in other dice games, due to the worker tiles and the fact that each die can be used in different ways.

Dice mechanic is similar to Feld's own Roma. However similarities between these 2 games end right there. BvB is an excellent medium weight euro. In fact, it is gradually becoming my favorite game. Ever.

The game flow of The Castles of Burgundy is simpler, smoother, and more cohesive than Stefan Feld's other games published by alea. The dice-as-actions system here is excellent. There are sufficient options that you're not at the mercy of the dice, but not so many that you won't be frustrated by what you roll. Players need to make their own luck by preparing for as many scenarios as possible. Smart players will not have as many "bad" rolls because they will have positioned themselves so that fewer rolls would be considered "bad."

I strongly prefer to play TCoB as a two-player game. You get exactly the same experience as the four-player game in a much faster and more exciting format.

Everyone was immediately enthralled with CoB. I was not. Did not feel like there was much strategy. One of these games where I fear that the balance detracts. Everything scores you points, so why does it matter what I do?

After 8 plays I am beginning to feel differently. Efficiency in completing areas is key. Bonus points for completing colors separates players. Grabbing special scoring tiles that complement an overall strategy can help you pull ahead. And building your area is just so much fun.

One play with three. Typical Alea—players all have their own playng areas and the only way for them to interact with their opponents is by taking the stuff that they want before they get a chance. Oh, and also buildings with special powers. I enjoyed it, and would play again, but it didn't wow me.

RATING: 7.5
Good strategy game for 2 to 4 player.  The game is pretty simple and even if it uses dice, it's not only luck driven.  On your turn, you roll 2 dice and must do 1 action with each of them.
The 4 available action are :
- Take a tile from the main board to your player board
- Add a tile from your board to your estate
- Sale goods
- Draw 2 worker tile
The result on the dice limit your choices but there his rarely only bad actions available.
If you really need a specific number on a dice, you can always spend worker to modify a dice result.
The game end after 25 turn, the player with the most victory point wins.

Usually I don't like comments like "too long for what it is". This is just kind way avoiding to say "I got bored after an hour". After one 4 player game I tend to say "too long for what it is" but not for the reasons of being bored. The point is: you play 5 phases with 5 rounds each with 2 actions (2 dice). This means you play at least 50 turns/actions. With bonusactions (Buildings/Castle) you have even more actions that enables you to fill up your board to 95% !  No matter how good or bad you play you fill up more than 90% of your board and getting therefore more 90% of the possible victory points (around 200 points). Only some timing issues will decide which players wins (if all players are of equal skill). 
I would prefer a shorter game not only resulting in less play time but also the fact you have to prioritise what to build because you end up only with 70% of your board filled up with tiles. This would need more strategy or tactic skills and results in a tighter fight on tiles.
Typical for Alea: small tiles and not 100% color matching.

Played once with 3. My one playing was about 6 months ago and I am struggling to remember anything of note about this game. It wasn't bad, bad games tend to be more memorable! I'll review my 6 rating if I get to play it again. March 2012

*UPDATE* played with 4. Ran rather long at 3 hours but enjoyable. Probably at its best with 3. I would happily play another half dozen times. My guess is that by then the game would be fully explored. Don't suppose I'll get to play even that many times so I will be unable to verify this thought. April 2012. 

*UPDATE* Pushed my rating up a point now I am comfortable with the rules. It will not go any higher and will probably lose interest for me after a dozen plays, not that that is a bad amount of table time compaired to most games I buy. August 2013

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Stephan Feld's rules are breathtakingly cool. But sometimes the games themselves become fiddly to the point of breaking. At those times, the sheer sensual--and especially tactile--fun of handling a game can overcome the tedium of setting it up. Not in this case. The Castles of Burgundy gives no pleasure visually, and the thin, cheap components are not fun to handle...and they must be handled continually. The set up is oppressively long.

I will play this, as long as someone else handles the coal shoveling.

----
Returning to the game, I find it's a blast to play two player. Little colored bags help with set-up woes--in fact, this is the game that taught me that proper set-up of the game in-box is a small, but key, factor of enjoyment out-of-box.

---

Sold. As with many Feld designs, it is "interesting," at the border of being fun, and monomaniacally contemptuous of the underrated sensual aspect of playing games. Such ugliness comes down to a contempt of playing with other people, in a shared space. It's an aspect I can no longer overlook when considering game purchases.

This game is absolutely outstanding. It is very simple to pick up, but it doesn't mean it is a game that one will necessary be able to master. It's just random enough to keep things fair between experienced and inexperienced players, but there's enough control present to ensure it doesn't become merely a game of chance.

My only complaints are game storage and setup. The insert for the box does not seem like it was designed by a person who knew what was involved in the game, and setup is atrocious. I think the latter would be better mitigated by the former, though. If it were setup so that the tiles were stored in individual compartments, it would be easier to just sit down and play the game.

RATING: 7.3
After one play, I can see why it's so well regarded -- a lot of strategies to try, and seems very well balanced (I managed to squeak out a win by 2 points, having only built 2 buildings, but was only one mine away from filling up and taking small or large bonus for everything else).  

There's a lot going on, and a lot to learn, but the iconography helps a lot once you figure it out.  It would be nice if the buildings were more distinctive.  The setup and cleanup time are quite long.  I'd love to play again, but ultimately, I very rarely have the opportunity to play a game that takes longer than 45-60 min, so it's unlikely to happen again anytime soon.

Great strategy game that combines eurogame mechanics with dice, in a way that it doesn't feel too luck-driven, Instead of buying a tile or good and placing it right away they go to limited storage spaces, which means timing is also a very important factor in the player's choices. It works great with two players.

Game itself is super tight, simple design but results in many different strategies. Nice balance of tactical and strategic thought, in that nice spot of being deep but not too deep in both respects. I'm a fan of how dice are managed in this game as well, rolls don't usually feel dead and even if they do the workers are good mitigation. Awesome replayability just from simple changes in the layout of the player board and the randomized setup.

Game is miserable from an aesthetic standpoint though. I have a bit of trouble quickly picking out where to place pieces in setup due to the drab scheme; this exacerbates the already fiddly nature of the round changes and setup/takedown (So many little tiles.....).

I'm a bit late to the party on this one, but that doesn't bother me. But because of that, I went into this one expecting to like it a lot more than I did. I enjoyed the gameplay and the decisions to be made with each roll of the dice. What bothered me was the downtime. Our one play was with four, and maybe that's what did it. But I really felt like five rounds was excessive. I could have had the same experience in three rounds, with the added challenge that not every plan is going to reach fruition. I also really didn't like the very top-heavy rules. Once you learn them, it's fine, but I much prefer games where you can either jump right in or learn as you play. I'd play this one again, but probably not with four.

The Castles of Burgundy is a dice-as-action driven tile placement game. This game is tremendously fluid. Roll dice and use those rolls to take actions. Either draft a tile or place a tile. Stephan Feld demonstrates some great design here. The game feels light and breezy, but also has a pleasing depth to complexity ratio. When collecting tiles, the buildings tend to be a favorite of mine as they all tie in nicely to whichever strategy you choose for a particular game. It scales very well and gives plenty of positive of feedback to each action through seeing satisfying growth in your kingdom and point rewards at every turn. The art is an easy criticism, but it evokes a certain style of euro from the last generation that I very much enjoy.

Lives up to the hype.  Wife loves it.  The dice and setup put it just below RFTG for us, though.  Wife and best bud always want to play.

Lowering my rating a bit because RFTG is more thematic and plays at different player counts better- and has less setup.

Excellent game by Stefan Feld; (for my opinion actually his best game ).  :thumbsup:

Burgen von Burgund is a fine mixture of dice rolling, worker placement, and tile laying.  I especially like the way how placing tiles trigger free actions which can trigger chain reaction of additional free actions.  This creates really positive and rewarding gaming experience.  Another thing I like is the way, dice are manipulated.  Players roll dice and can use worker tiles to modify dice values by +1 or -1.  One fine details here is, that a '6' can be turned into a '1' by "adding" +1 (and vice versa).  This greatly increases the players' felxibility and makes unfavorable dice rolls much less probable.

Burgen von Burgund works with any number of players but is best with two players because of the reduced playing time (~45 minutes), almost nonexistent downtime and more tactical gameplay.

My rating of '9' applies to the two player ganme.  With 4 players I'd rate it 7.5.

„Ez egyszer mind a tiéd lesz fiam…”
A játék már nem mai „gyerek”, de én csak a többszöri pozitív beszámolókat, kritikákat követően vettem rá magam, hogy kipróbáljam (erre jó a játék online verziója).
Földbirtokosként célom a rendelkezésre álló uradalmam felvirágoztatása. A játékban a választható akciók fontosabb részéhez szükséges alapot kockadobások jelentik (és igen itt lakozik némi szerencse is a játékban). Általánosságban elmondható, hogy mindig tudsz valami jó akciót végrehajtani (nem részletezném őket), de a trükk az, hogy a legjobbat válaszd a lehetőségeidhez képest előre tervezve a területed beépítését. A játék javára írom, hogy nem kell a többiekkel „törődnöd”, hanem a saját magad vágyait követve építgetheted birodalmadat (ezt nagyon szeretem a 7 Csoda társasban is). Természetesen a győzelemhez nem árt játékostársaid lépéseit is figyelned és az akcióidat azzal összekötni, hogy esetlegesen csökkented az ő akcióik hatékonyságát (legjobb példa, amikor egy-egy olyan lapkát veszel el, amire éppen szüksége lenne, főleg, ha ezt tudod kombinálni azzal, hogy te kezdesz az adott körben). Mivel a játékban az akcióidból élsz, azon lehetőségek, amelyekkel plusz akciókhoz jutsz, vagy más akciók által biztosított hatásokat bónuszként szerzel meg, értékesek. Van még egy-két taktikai lépés, amelyet érdemes követni, de alapvetően mindenki pasziánszszerűen építkezik és a végén vagy összejön minden, vagy nem. Így szívesen ajánlom a játékot a kezdő társasjátékosok számára is.
Összességében megtetszett, szívesen játszom vele.

I like how much control you have on a turn despite dice rolls dictating your actions.  Luck can still factor into your play but the mitigation with +1/-1 workers and the variety of choices level the playing field.

This is the first Feld game I've played.  I like it.

I've read countless time the saying "Boring as feld!". Each time I would look at his game, that's the feeling I had. Boring. But I was able to get a copy of this game (Feld most successful game) for a very good price so I couldn't pass it.

I was surprised how much I like the game. Sure it's a point salad but since I don't own any other feld, the formula doesn't seem to washed out. I'm not going to be a super Fan of Feld but I can at least recognize how great this game is.

Pasted on theme, point salad game.  That is definitely true.  that said, the mix of mechanics is just flat out fun.  Multiple different strategies on how to accumulate points.  Always something to do and solid decisions within the game.  It is a bit fiddly, but a game insert has certainly helped managing the set-up or tear-down time.

This is the pinnacle of these German-style eonomic games.  Quite fun and tense, with a sense of accomplishment.

Point-mongering games can sometimes get away with being overlong, but not this overlong--well over two hours is egregious. The dice mechanics also serve to inject a feeling of frustration now and again, especially when you roll doubles. At least it's marginally cleaner than Feld's other designs?

I've no idea why ppl adore this game so much. It's the same old stuff and there's nothing special to it.

Given, it's a working game and it's not a bad one, but it takes too long and it's pretty much solitaire. Pretty straight foward like most Feld games nowadays. Do this to get that many points, no matter which action you choose. *zzzZZZZ*

Works better as a two player game, but still, nothing that stands out. There are so many better games out there, I just don't get it.

I'm a big fan of Feld's designs, and this one is a lot of fun. I love Luna, but I always opt for this one to hit the table. It is basically a deckbuilder with tiles, and you gain VP if you build a series of mini-engines and chain-reactions.

Lots of information to take in when learning the rules and it seems overwhelming when you are covering them, but once the game starts you see how elegant and simple the gameplay is, and also how easy it is to decipher the board, the multitude of tiles and powers, and the strategies. A gorgeous game, and one that scales extremely well from 2-4 with no variance in gameplay, interaction, or enjoyment.

Weird that I enjoy this one as much as I do as I'm not typically a fan of a lot of games that involve dice. But the mitigation and how you plan around the randomness of the die makes this a brilliant strategy game that is more about planning than simply dumb luck. Its quickly becoming one of my favorite games.

RATING: 8
This game is unique, intriguing, and fast-paced enough to elevate itself above most of the competition.   It is remarkably well-balanced.

A game that never ceases to challenge the mind is a key component to its success and replayability factor.  To a large degree, this game has it.   Also, this game is very simple to understand, yet has surprising depth to the gameplay that makes it very desirable to play over and over again.  Nearly every action yields victory points, but it is not always immediately evident what is the ideal move to take.

There seems to be no foolproof strategy in this game.  One must adapt to what the game and other players give you.

Castles of Burgundy is like most Euros that I find unappealing. It has numerous decisions to be made that will affect your performance. The actions allowed are deep enough to give lots of replayability. But there is virtually no theme. What does it mean when I "roll a 3" and take a cow pasture from the 3 depot? The disconnect between mechanics (which are admittedly strong) and the theme (which is pasted on) is too great for me to give this game an endorsement.

I hate this game! But at the same time I keep on wanting to come back for more! Maybe because I keep losing? I don't know. So far I've only played it as a 2 player and it's a great 2 player game! So rare for a Euro game. This is the first Euro game that frustrates me but at the same time I can't help keep thinking about how I can play it better. The game feels fast, because there's no down time, even when it's your opponent's turn, you're thinking what you can do next and even though your moves are depicted by the dice you roll, you know you have workers you can use to manipulate it and you know there's building tiles with their skills you can fall back to, so there's so many options you can take and you feel like you're in control despite the game relying on rolling a dice which usually is a luck thing. When I lose this game I don't feel like my opponent is luckier than me, I just feel like he's the better player and that's why it frustrates me!

Concise rules, very well paced smooth game play, clever use of dice, requires strategic planning yet uses randomness coupled with two-action turns make you think with your feet rather than AP to death. I think this game (once again) shows how Stefan Feld masters the game design fundamentals; the game does not try to be anything too fancy, but all elements are just impeccably well designed and balanced; the game provides exciting game play with clockwork reliability and precision. I really anticipate to play this much more.

There's a very clever mechanic at the core of "The Castles of Burgundy" that I usually like a lot. But the thinkyness and lack of flavor of the game suck out a lot of fun. Yeah, it's cool and clever and stuff. But usually I just don't want to play it.

There are three main things I have against this game:
- lots of dice rolls which can make or break your game (the randomness is only partially mitigated by the workers that you can collect)
- the winning score is in the 200-point range (I prefer games with a top score of under 100, so that the game doesn't turn into a runaway)
- so many decisions make my turns very long!

My first play of this was a 4-player game, and it took over 3 hours!  There are so many decisions to make, and you have to wait for the previous player's turn to finish before you even roll the dice, so absolutely no analysis can be done in parallel.


Also, unlike other Stefan Feld games, the iconography is not easy to understand.  In particular, the beige tiles have a picture of a building which you have to decode each time, using the table on the player mat.  Why not have the symbols for the action on the tile rather than a meaningless picture?  Bad design, if you ask me!

I'd prefer Macao... the dice there affect everybody equally, and people can take their turns almost simultaneously.  And of course, I like Notre Dame and In the Year of the Dragon better too.

RATING: 8
I was afraid to get a game which sounded too much like others in my collection, but this is not the case.
There is dice rolling, there is a spatial element and there is a quite terrible fight - indeed the only interaction is mediated by grabbing things first, but if you play in your little corner without paying attention, you'll get horribly trashed.
Maybe it's groupthink, I've read many comments about playing without interaction; well those playing the "kind" way are missing a superbly balanced piece of nasty.
You can feel how much design genius has gone into the numerous options the game offers; while the game engine is deceptively simple, there is a staggering amount of choices, all have been wonderfully crafted by Mr Feld; moreover, the different player boards and varying starting position offer and impressive array of strategies to consider; the dice impose shifting tactics: I can't imagine getting tired of this game anytime soon.
The only let-down is the poor color set; the yellow is greenish on the tiles (and looks like the light green), while the beige and grey are barely distinguishable.  Too bad as the iconography is nice and the whole is pleasing.
Do not mix passive and agressive players, and avoid AP prone people at all costs. Or limit the number of player to 2 or 3.

Another one of those games with lots of weird iconography that is a big hindrance to learning. I feel like I'm bringing this up with every new game I play lately, but it's true. The game tries to do so much with icons instead of language that comprehension is practically nil until you decipher every damn thing. I am really starting to hate this trend.

With that out of the way, Burgen is quite good. Using dice to limit your choices the way they are used here is inspired, and the fact that you can expend resources to tweak your rolls is also very clever. I also like how it seems to be increased in scope simply by having scores go much higher than most games of this type. Dramatic thirty point swings are the norm here, meaning that the guy in last is never out of the running, and the guy in front never has a truly safe lead. That is very cool. Lots of ways to score and lots of options to consider. Looking forward to playing this one again. I'll give this a solid 7 for now, but this may go higher with more familiarity. I think this one has some good meat on it that's worth savoring.

So I finally tried the king of point salads- a genre I have been somewhat avoiding.  I was very pleasantly surprised by this game overall.  There were lots of opportunities for planning short-to-mid-term which is my usual wheelhouse.  However, the fact that everything awards points makes the choices seem relatively unimportant.  I assume that is actually not true, and I worry that if there actually is strategy that can be learned in this game, it will take far too many games to emerge.  So I don't really see this getting a lot of play, but I would like to try another time or two and see if I can start picking up strategy.

RATING: 8.9
First of all it contains so many rules you can't even count. But after the first turn everything just got clear in your head and you start to build up a strategy soon. However it isn't that easy because everything is connected to everything. I mean you have plenty of choices to make, lots of way to get points - which i actually love! I was scared by the dice at first, but the game balances the luck well with the laborers. It is more of an abstract strategy game, i feel nothing from the theme, but if the game is okey i don't care, which is the case with this one. The first game was so long i was waiting for the end from the second half, but i predict the second game will be half of the time. Played it a few more games now. It works best as a 2 players game which ends just about 1 hour.

Pros / Cons:
-I love endless choices the game makes me to do.
-I love the cominations and the optimization to reach them.
-Very nice idea to use the laborers to get rid of luck.
-Outstanding price / value.

-More player interaction please. Boardgames are social games, which is more fun if there is a little spice on the table. Why do you make multiplayer solitaire instaed of making some fun into it?
-The artwork is kind of ugly, but the gameplay at least compensate it.
-The first game was so long i was waiting to be finished after the second half of the game.
-Sometimes the administration can be strained.

RATING: 7.5
The Castles of Burgundy is a Stefan Feld dice-driven tile-laying game, and in many ways a multi-player solo game. So what is there (besides the designer's name) in this one that makes it a top 100 game?

Well, first off, it plays well for 2-4, and offers a variable challenge based on both random tile distribution, play order and funds available at any given time.  Strategies can vary greatly in value based on tile availibility and what player's can acquire, when.

All of this makes for a consistently entertaining tile-laying game, and when the additional boards are added in it seems quite certain no 2 games will be quite alike.

That, with the ability to control income and the dice somewhat means that while there is plenty of random variation, there are also a large number of real decisions to make at any given play, but not so many that AP has to set in.

Definitely a keeper, this one took a couple of plays to grow on me, but after 6 plays I rate it a strong 7.5.

This is a nice, scalable game, not too interactive, but very playable in lots of circumstances, and one of Stefan Feld's more public friendly games in general.

Solid euro with dice.
There is a feeling, though, that the bigger half of point you get any way (automatically/mechanically). Like you get 150 points covering your board in any unwise order, and the last 50 points you get if you play smart. The drawback here is you still need to earn those 150 points placing tiles and moving (and not forgetting to move) the score token. 

Ships, buildings, mines, animals, knowledge tiles. Take from the bank, place on the board. Basically, the quicker and thicker you cover your board, the more points you get. Plus, knowledge tiles may be extremely useful for bonus points and stretching dice numbers.

RATING: 8
(06/2012) For some inexplicable reason, I was beginning to dislike Stefan Feld's game designs--maybe it was my "meh" experience with Luna--but this was surprisingly fun, accessible, and engaging, along the lines of Lords of Waterdeep.

While I usually dislike dice-allocation games (Kingsburg comes to mind), this was a pleasant exercise in puzzle-solving to each of my dice rolls. While the game board was initially daunting, with all the spaces and numbers and stacks and whatnot, I quickly "got it". Everything on the main board and player tableaus have die faces of varying number of pips. The 2D6 die rolls represent what opportunities open up. While this may seem completely random and chaotic, picking up and laying down specific kingdom tiles to gain specific capabilities is key in maximizing the benefits of those randomly generated pips.

There is very little downtime, and game play is relatively quick. It is difficult to anticipate future plays, as most attention is focused on "what can I do with the die rolls I just made?" Since the board is seeded with both fixed and random elements, it is about leveraging what little resources one has on maximizing the limited set of actions. The fun and satisfaction comes from "discovering" building/action combos, much like in Dominion, out of the seemingly chaotic distribution of tokens.

There are a number of intriguing game mechanisms that mesh together well, seamlessly, that makes this game unlike any other game out there today. I look forward to more plays. It is a solid '8'.

Update (02/16/2014) 6 plays: After pondering about this in my subconscious for several months, won my first game. The game is all about focusing and identifying the most resourceful combinations, for any given dice roll. There is also the element of planning ahead, for potential combinations down the road. This, and other Feld designs have been derided as "point salads", but I am beginning to see them for what they are. They're not bad, as far as games go. But great? No.

One play with four.  Here's what I got out of it:

• "Pigs" are actually naked, shaved townsfolk crawling around on all fours squealing like piggies.  Still good eatin', though.

• The Haunted Mansion has two mysterious poofs.

• There is no mechanism to determine which aristocrat loses his or her nose to syphilis; but then I'm probably confusing this with [i]The Cankers of Burgundy[/i].

More comments:

[q="HiveGod"]I dunno.  It hits me like [i]Carcassonne[/i] with dice, but not really dice since there's no bell curve and you can adjust the pips up or down with workers.  So it's really just a genteel eggshell-walkin' [i]Carc[/i] where everyone engages in lonely parallel play like a bunch of four-year-olds at the sand table.

Here's an example of the heated player interaction that can happen:

Player A:  [thinking]  [i]Man, I can't wait to pick chickens.[/i]

Player B:  [picks chickens]

Player A:  Goddammit!

Also, is "shipping pink" a euphemism for something unsavory?*

[size=7]*God, I hope so.  Might save the game for me.[/size][/q]

Have really been enjoying this game. It's a fantastic two player. It's a little slow with 4 people but everybody loves it and it's a lot of fun. It would be a 10 if it wasn't for the fiddliness of the setup. I might overcome that, though.

[b]Update:[/b] It has been 3 years since this was last played (in 2013). I still own it but it just doesn't make it to the table. For that alone it might go down a little in rating.

I have to admit I didn't quite believe it, when I heard people saying that the theme was very thin on this game. But as it turns out, the theme is practically nonexistent. I don't mind it that much, though. Each turn is another bite of that crunchy decision pie. A good game with quirky mechanisms, but I have a hard time even suggesting a complimentary theme.

I used to really like this game but it wore out its welcome. Classic point salad which is a game system I have decided I do not like (Sorry Mr. Feld). Doesn't seem to matter what you do and everyone ends up at the same place. No idea who is winning until points are counted which I know some people will like but I find too random.

I was surprised by the slickness of play of this game - solid, quick, and proportionately substantial. I love how though there's a randomness to rolls and tiles, it's about taking strategic advantage of what is available - my favorite type of strategy game. My only complaint is the quality of the game mats and tiles, which should definitely be made of heavier material.

Even though I´ve been into gaming for about 12 month back then, this game fanned the flames like no other! I wouldn´t play it with 3 or 4 because it simply works so perfectly well with 2 players and definitely has the right amount of player-interaction, without getting to fiddly. My wife and I enjoyed every single one of our 12 plays so far to the max! A modern classic!

Sencillamente genial. Lo tiene todo: interacción, emoción y suspense hasta el final. Es de estos juegos que te dejan pensando qué podías haber hecho diferente para ganar y con el gusanillo de la revancha. Va igual de bien con 2 que con 4 jugadores, aunque es más divertido con 4 que con 2: hay más piques. ¡¡¡Para colmo, se puede conseguir a muy buen precio!!! Me sorprende que no esté puntuado más alto.
Sin lugar a dudas, un gran juego.

The biggest flaw in this game is being ugly. Even for a Feld game, it's ugly.

Still a really good euro with a nice level of tension.

This game has a lot of competition from this newer generation of euros that are just as solid mechanically, but not as mundane visually and thematically.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.2
I think that Castles of Burgundy is a gem of a game. It is very easy, conceptually, but has a depth of strategy which some other titles lack. The game is a nice mix of luck and strategy. You roll dice to determine your draw each round, but are allowed to use workers to increase or decrease the value of the die, assuming you have a worker available. In this way the game also mixes in an element of worker management and strategy to compensate for the random luck of the die rolls. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.9
You roll dice which let you pick up tiles, place tiles, or ship goods for points. There are tokens that let you fudge the dice. There is a puzzle element on where you can place your tiles: everything must be touching, and the color of what you're placing must match the background and number on your board. There is a ton of downtime with 4 players, as you can't do anything until everyone has selected, and sometimes you won't know what's left until it is your turn. This game is fine, but doesn't justify 90+ minutes.

HOWEVER I can image how playtime would be much quicker playing two-player. I would love to try a game that way and could imagine my rating of the game improving after.

Not my sort of game - obviously very clever with good mechanics, but moved far too slowly.  The number of different tiles makes this too complex and the downtime between turns is excruciating.  Maybe improves after 2/3 plays, but I don't really want to find out.

A dice driven board game with the dice limiting options within each of the possible actions.  The main focus is moving tiles from the common area via 3 private parking spaces to your own duchy.

Much lighter than some of Stefan Feld's games (I'm looking at Trajan here) and very much the better for it. Like Macao there's a novel use of dice and mechanisms to mitigate the luck involved. Too light to really be counted in the very top flight of games, but unusually among recent Euros the options aren't overwhelming and the game is actually fun to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is certainly the gentlest Feld game I've ever played; it lacks the explicit punishment element of all his other games.  There's still a lot to go for, though.  This is really a set collection game with a lot of different sets and an interesting little building element where it matters where things are.  It's a nice little game and I'd like to get to know it better.  (1 play)

It can be pretty cutthroat for a WP euro when playing with 2 because there are so many opportunities to cut off your opponent's plans or deny them resources. Very pleased with this purchase, one of my default go-to-games for 2P

I usually steer clear of this sort of multiplayer solitaire (and make no mistake, this is an exceptionally solitary game), but there's something about this one which means I enjoy it more than I feel I ought to. There are undoubtedly multiple paths to victory, although especially in the 2-player game some of these will turn out not to have been valid half way through, because the bonus tiles they depend on simply haven't come up. For an optimisation exercise, though, it is fun and interesting, but without much significant variation between games. Also plays nice and quickly: we can crank out a 2-player game in 45 minutes or so.

Stefan Feld es un diseñador que suele cortapegar mecánicas de otros juegos y logra diseños secos y sin alma... pero es un tío listo y lo hace bien. En este caso se suma a la tendencia (¿actual?) de usar dados. Mecánicamente es un juego que consiste en colocar losetas en lugares, ambos determinados por dados... pero no está restringido a usar exclusivamente la puntuación obtenida en la tirada para poder hacer algo productivo. Hay que buscar combos y eficiencia en las acciones y además, sacar un 6 no es mejor que sacar un 1..  PROS: Muchas opciones dónde elegir (más que Agricola o Troyes). Muy rejugable (9 tableros distintos) CONS: Curva de aprendizaje inclinada porque cuanto mejor conozcas las losetas y sus efectos, mejor jugarás (y hay muchas). Componentes por debajo de la calidad de Alea. Que Dios te ayude si eres daltónico. El juego termina "tarde" (casi todo el mundo ha completado sus opciones)

[ENG]

Stefan Feld is a boardgame designer who copies mechanics from another games and does dry and souless new designs... but is a clever buddy and he does it pretty well. In this case he follows the mainstream tendency based on using dice. The main mechanism is tile placement on the board and this process is determinated by dice... but isn´t restricted just only by dice results. You should look for "combos" and eficiency in your actions, and to obtain a 6 with dice is not better than obtain a 1. PROs: lots of options (much more than in Agricola o Troyes). Replayable becouse of nine different boards. CONS: difficult learning curve becouse of the different tiles (there are a lot). Game components below the average. God bless you if you´re colourblind. The game ends late (usually when everybody have finished all his options).

After one play I knew this would be a great addition to my collection, so I bought it as soon as I could, for a reasonable price. It's an engaging game and while there are dice, luck is minimal. It gives you enough challenges in the short playtime of an hour.

Un german per giocatori, studiato attentamente per cercare di bilanciare le tante modalità di far punti. Essenzialmente tattico e legato alla capacità di riconoscere le migliori combo, tra lanci di dadi ed azioni di acquisto/attivazione di tessere utilizzando i dadi stessi. Tessere che peraltro non si fanno certo apprezzare per leggibilità e senso estetico.

Wow, this is probably one of my most played games. I own a physical copy and play online. It's extremely addicting and so fun. Play time is extremely short at two people (my current preferred count). If you are only using the 1 board this game will get stale very quick. With expansion boards and the back sides of the original board this game is given new life. I do not really card for the expansion rules just the boards.

Second to Trajan for the point-salad medal, the various uses of a pair of d6's in The Castles of Burgundy make for myriad options that dwindle each round as players deplete them. Many paths to victory that can be hindered by adversaries make for plenty of replayability and interaction while the completely overt information and luck-mitigating factors for the dice create an environment where new players can learn quickly and excel.

Finally got this to the table and I really enjoyed it.  I like that there are dice rolls that give you choices of tiles, but that there are ways to change the die roll.  Or you can use a non-die action.  It worked very nicely as a 2 player game.

RATING: 7
The only thing I don't like about Castles of Burgandy is the production value of the components and art, which seem to fall well below average relative to all the other games I play in both the main playing board and the tiles.  Otherwise, I love this game!  Players roll dice that will dictate their choices of actions in a given turn.  There is a great mechanic that causes you to not get screwed by undesirable dice rolls, worker tiles that you can spend to modify the dice.  So if you need a 2 and you roll a 3, you can spend one worker tile to do the action corresponding to 2.  I like that there is no player elimination and there are multiple legitimate paths to victory.  This is a deep game and it has very strong replay value.

An elegant dice-based Euro that has a nice balance between randomness and control, and lots of replayability. Of course, the theme is thin--but enough of a link there that one could kind of imagine growing a country estate. Really though, it'd needn't be in Renaissance France, it could be building anything--aa city in feudal Japan, or a monument in ancient Egypt, or a moonbase on the moon, or a manufacturing company, or bees building a hive...etc. etc. A good puzzle, though, regardless.

One play - thought it was pretty fun. I found some small things to focus on like completing areas or shipping a lot of goods that were fun to accomplish, unlike many Euros  where you're just mindlessly getting points. It will probably join Agricola and 7 Wonders as goto Euros to use to fend off other suggestions.

I can see why others would enjoy this- building up your castle is fun. But due to there being so little (None) player interaction, its like only playing half a game (or a quarter or whatever). So it gets boring waiting for others to finish their turn, especially if they have decision paralysis.

RATING: 6
Really wanted to love this one, but the game is just strangled by the randomness of your dice too often for it to score higher than a 6 for me.

Aside from the dice, I love how the game is constructed.  There are a few different routes to gain points, and when the players are trying different strategies there's some great tension in the min-maxing that occurs in the late game.

But those dice...If the game was shorter then it wouldn't bother me, but this is a relatively long game and when your entire game is ruined by a couple of useless throws at the end of the game, that's just annoying and makes you feel that you have achieved nothing.

I've only owned it for about six months, but have an amazing number of plays because all the gamers in family and local area in general like it. Puzzle aspect, satisfaction in building your estate, especially given the different board layouts, and getting to roll dice each turn. Interaction is there but low and fun to adjust given changing game state prior to your turn without the heavy penalties typical of Feld.

This is a great game that is just extremely drab, dry, and nearly visually repulsive. I enjoy the mechanisms and choices. The GAME is fun, but it is kind of an eye sore and lacking of nearly all theme. Occasionally I am in the mood for it, but unfortunately I find myself passing on this one for really shallow aesthetic reasons frequently. That being said, the game here is well worth your time and really is a lot of fun.

This is a relaxing strategy game that's perfect for a quiet evening with your partner. It's really fun to build up your estate while the random draw of tiles each round sets you up for some interesting tactical decisions as you figure out how to best maximize your score. Having played Bora Bora first of the two, I think I prefer that one for its slightly heavier nature; the decisions are a lot more difficult. But CoB provides a nice competition that can be moderately interactive with some tile stealing. I'm looking forward to clocking some more plays and adjusting my rating with time.

A really interesting game.  A unique mechanic with the dice determining the actions, which cuts down on the number of options and so focuses the tactics in any one turn.  It's not unlike Duel in the tension involved in 2-player games with my wife.  At just £20 it's also superb value, being made from cheaper components with doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the game.  Well done to the publishers for that.

Not much to say really after playing this in 2013. It’s Feld’s usual very good generic point grabber, where there are lots of ways to use dice and grab points.  There is some potential light screwage, and a luck factor that shouldn't be too high. Seems overrated here to be honest, and I like Feld. 

If I played this 6 years ago, it might be a point higher, but after 700 games where a boat load were Euros, this one just did not have anything in particular that stood out other than what I mentioned (hence the generic label). I am REALLY hoping Stefan builds a game on a theme, because he is such a good designer and for me it’s the only thing really missing in his games to elevate them to a higher level for me.

This is the game that made me a lifelong Feld fan. The game only has 4 types of simple actions - pick up tiles, build tiles, sell goods and collect workers. But how these actions and different building tiles come together creates a wonderfully deep and complex game. The weight of this game is also just right for a new player but its complexity keeps experienced players engaged even after many plays. If you haven't played any Feld games this is a good starting point.

My favourite Feld game by a country mile - his other games are "clever", and this is no different but this is also so smooth.

I even forgive it the randomness with tile draw and die rolls. It is all about adjusting and adapting because there are so many ways to score points.

Plays well (if infuriatingly because not all the tiles will now come out in the draw ) in 2 and 3 player games too!

Castles of Burgundy is a  well-designed strategic tile-laying game in which players acquire properties, sell goods, hire workers and earn silver to arrange their fiefdom in a manner that will result in the greatest number of victory points.  The mechanics of the game are very satisfying, with occasional "wow moments" when a single, well-timed action leads to subsequent high scoring actions.  

While there is luck in the game, the mechanics grant the player wide latitude to mitigate the luck by trading workers for changes in the dice result.  The game mechanic invites strategy by confronting the player with numerous options as he or she considers the composition of their fiefdom and tile placement timing within their fiefdom.  For instance, a player may choose to score  points early in the game by completing cities before their opponents, or set themselves up for long-term point generation by strategically placing tiles (i.e., university tiles) for potentially decisive points at the end of the game.  

While player interaction is essentially limited to denying an opponent access to a particular tile, the game incites enough competition among the players to be an enjoyable socially engaging experience.  

Each time I have played Castles of Burgundy, some aspect of the game has amazed me.  Castles of Burgundy has just the right balance of strategy, engagement, satisfaction and length to be a great choice for 2 players looking for an enjoyable light-medium weight game.

While this is a very good game, I prefer the more complex mechanisms of other games designed by Mr. Feld, i.e. Trajan and Bruges.

Fun enough game. The chaining together of actions and the potential for 'big turns' is what keeps this game interesting, since at its core it's a very bland "use dice to take or place tiles" kind of thing where everything gives you some points and it's fairly obvious what should give you the most points. But with the bonus actions there is enough of a twist and you're being pulled in different enough directions to keep things somewhat interesting. It is on the lighter side though, I didn't expect it to be this light going in. And really I'm not sure there's enough to bring me back to it. Certainly happy to play it but I don't feel any particular need to.

The process of rolling dice and working within the constraints of the results and the rules of the game has never been more fun than in The Castles of Burgundy.

Every turn is a new puzzle to find the combination of moves that will result in more points (or at least an opportunity for them).

While the game can have some periods of downtime (especially with new players), it doesn't ruin the game at all. And while it is playable with three or four players, it's actually at its best with two players - there is much less luck and randomness with fewer players.

I don't foresee removing this classic from my collection at any point in the future.

Great euro game! You usually always have meaningful decisions to make, even if your opponents pick what you were going to take. Also, that is a big thing in this game.

You roll two dice each round and you get an action for each die depending on what you rolled for that die.  There are a number of options for each die roll and ways to expand those options and add different options.  The main focus is claiming pieces from a common game board and later playing them to your personal board.  I enjoyed playing it, but the options could overwhelm even the least of the AP-prone.

While a completely different game from Feld's other design Macao it has a bit of feel from that design.  You've got dice used in a semi-unique way, ships, goods pick up and delivery, tiles (vs. building/person cards) that override the default rules if you've activated (built) them, a similar turn order mechanism, etc.

Also like Macao your first play or several plays can take a long time.  Each player has 25 turns total in the game with each turn consisting of 2 (or more when building certain tiles) actions.  I wonder if a variant to play only 20 turns would work?   Also even for those of us who were 1st time players, we all scored over 200 points (looping the score track twice).

Even though it was long, I do have to say it was fun.  Can't wait to try the "advanced" player boards/maps.

What a sad, boring box this game has. A shame, really, because I like this one a lot. Basically you're trying to build up a city around a central castle, whether that be with buildings, pastures for animals, silver mining areas, rivers or other special yellow sections, perhaps you could term them industry? Mostly they just give you bonuses for your other sections. You have silver, workers, and goods to help you, as some of the game is based on the chance of dice rolling. You have to use your brain a lot in this one, as it requires a lot of forethought and planning based on what comes available in each round and your strategy to get the most points, which are earned in a variety of ways. I will say, this game could get slightly dry after a while, but there are different boards to choose from to mix things up.

This was ho hum.  I played with four players and it just dragged on and on.  I didn't feel invested in this game between turns.  My daughter looked bored as well.

No, it's not a about the dice either, because I love dice in games, and I do like how CoB utilizes the dice.  Just didn't click for me.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (April 2012)

At first it seemed like a great game, but later some concerns began to appear.  The quality of the components is regular, but what really bugs me is the awful similar looking colors. I wish they could be really different from each other. I´m ok with long games, but this game is very long with the full complement of players and this leads to an annoyingly high down time so now I believe this is best enjoyed as a 3 player game. 

But my main concern is the massive swings in VPs, I feel there is little strategy as the best VP generators are clearly defined so it is mostly luck if you can get them or not. For example, if you don`t go for the huge VPs awarded for animal tiles you will lose and I don`t like that in the game as there is one path to victory. Perhaps if I played with a different state board I could appreciate some improvement in this area. For now I want to play again to review my feelings about the game to see if the rating goes up or down.

I still think Troyes is the best game out there with the dice allocation mechanic.

After some more plays, I’m still worried about the animal tiles. They are a must take as they offer a lot of points, if you get them early you have a high probability of winning. Also each player get only one kind of animal because if I attack other players taking the animals they already have on their estates, I also hurt myself, so (in most games) all players have only taken one kind of animal.

Still this is a good game and one I enjoy playing, perhaps my 3th favorite Feld (after Trajan, and In the Year of the Dragon). I will play with the expert boards next time to see if that lessen the “animal effect”.

I’m now in love with this game. Played with different boards eliminated my concerns about the animal tiles, now I’m concerned about the balance of the different boards but it is a very minor concern. I really like this game, nowadays, I prefer to play it with only 2 players, but I would play it with 3. I won’t play it with four players as the down time is excessive. As today, this is my second favorite Feld (after Bora Bora).

One of 2011´s favorites.

RATING: 7
I didn't find it "soulless" as multiple of my geekbuddies have commented; I actually had a lot of fun building my little city. Processional maybe, and definitely longer than its weight warrants. I do think the use of dice isn't as much to my tastes as in Macao, to which this game will be compared. In Burgund the dice restrict how one can act on one's turn, a much looser restriction admittedly than in Settlers of Catan where one can find oneself waiting for a specific 2d6 result for many turns, but a similar feel. The only real planning one can do is to keep options open on all dice numbers - compare to Macao where one finds that one will have 5 red cubes 5 turns from now, and the object is to sync up other resources with those in future turns. I'm not done with Burgund yet but I'm not sure it's a standout for me.

RATING: 7
Stefan Feld makes games that have been affectionately called 'Victory Point Salads'. This game is like a salad itself. It may be a little bit difficult for people to differentiate the various shades and varieties of green+yellow (grellow?) that can be found on the boards.

Design decisions aside, The Castles of Burgundy is an excellent game with a somewhat poor theme. True to the spirit of Euro Games, The Castles of Burgundy is somewhat dry but has very solid, and very well-designed mechanics. 

If you do not mind playing a game for its gameplay alone, then the Castles of Burgundy is for you. Otherwise, The Crushers of Brogundy might be more a more suitable alternative.

RATING: 10
To date this is my favorite of Feld's titles and that's saying something.  Given the random setup and the fact that the die rolls dictate where you may draw tiles from and play them I don't see this going stale anytime soon. If you like Feld or your group enjoys med/heavy euro type games pick this title up.  This certainly falls into the category of dryer fare so if that's not your groups thing stay away.  Also if you roll doubles on two six sided die everytime you roll them I would give this game a pass. 

***Update***
This has dethroned Le Harve for me.  This title get played often in my group and I don't see that changing anytime soon!

Very fun and immersive game.  You have to have a beat on your gameplay and your opponent's gameplay so that you can plan your moves ahead appropriately.  Several ways to score and keep the game competitive, so you're never out of the race. The dice/luck element is a bit of a negative, but it's ok because there is so much strategy available to thwart your opponent's gameplay if the dice roll didn't come out in your favor for the round.  The quality of the player will matter when playing this game...

Thoroughly enjoyed it.

The Castles of Burgundy is a detailed strategy game set in the Loire Valley of France during medieval times. Players assume the role of princes trying to build the greatest estates in the land by becoming more prosperous than their competitors. Over the course of five rounds, players collect points by trading, livestock farming, city building and scientific research. They must buy and sell goods or labor and use action tiles for building, shipping, mining, livestock and knowledge across two game boards.

This is right up there with one of the best games... I made the mistake of teaching this to my wife and now she kicks my butt!! Not the easiest game to teach but once you've got it you have a rich game. It's interaction with other players is more subtle and most cut through it gets is, 'why take that tile? I needed that'.
This is my wife's favorite game and I don't mind one bit. I taught my dad this game recently and was reminded this game shouldn't be the first game you play if your not a gamer. Still towards the end of his first game he had the basics down and enjoyed his second game much more. We both still lost to my wife though ;)

Well, I can see why this game is ranked so highly. This is a great game. The mechanics are simple enough (though you'll spend some time looking up tile abilities at first), but there really is a decent amount of strategy. I really like this kind of tile laying, where you pick a tile, decide where to place it and it activates one (or more) special effects (Suburbia, Glen More, and Ginkgopolis all look to be very good with different takes on that mechanic). It's multiplayer solitaire, but it doesn't suffer for that at all, really (and my wife and I LOVE player conflict).

Territory building that determines the options based on dice rolls over a set number of turns. For each die, you can choose to buy from the options under that number… and place it in a number-specific place on your map (though there are modifiers you can get with a die too). No two games are the same, which is nice, and the boards vary once you decide to go past the base versions.

PLUS: easy to learn/teach, many variations, heavy involvement with what other players are doing
MINUS: when someone takes the lead they really take the lead

ESSENTIAL game for those who want something with a bit of strategy and a bit of luck -- a definite deserver of its top 100 placement on BGG and other lists

After 1 (3p) play: Really solid Euro, has strategy and tactics and was pretty tight. Theme was not immersive in any way though, but we had fun. This is one of the longer Euros, in the Puerto Rico category. 

One problem with it though, is that it seems to be lacking a good narrative arc. What you are doing in the last roun doesnt feel that different from what you did in the first round. I would have liked it to be more of an engine building game. 

Sold after 4 plays with 2 and 4 players. Recently played it with 2 and that worked much better. Still way too many rounds and still too bad that you basicly cant do anything without getting a small amount of points. Deserves a redesigned second edition without all the salad (maybe get the Keyflower guys working on it?)

RATING: 8
Another innovative "dice" game from Feld. Castles is lighter than most of his games, but still creates lots of decision points. I can see why this is one of his most highly ranked titles as it is pretty darn accessible. The rules for his games are never complicated, but often the best decisions are rather opaque in initial play-throughs. With Castles, you can more easily see the path to points and generate an initial strategy. It's not my favorite Feld, but with some players I'll have more success getting this to the table than other titles I might personally prefer.

UDPATE 10/15 (upgraded from 7 to 8): The more I play this game, the more I like it...

Castles of Burgundy is a point-salad that ably demonstrates how much fun that sort of play can be. While the theme doesn't absolutely saturate the game, it is implemented well enough that it is useful when learning how to play.

The most euro-y Euro I ever owned. In fact, it was too Euro for my current gaming partners.  :-/   

I definitely enjoyed it, but didn't see enough table time.  Not the most intuitive game and lots of various "rule exception" tiles that can be tough to get a grasp on at first. Still, I can see how many gamers rank it highly and look forward to playing someone else's copy if I have the chance.

 Typical Euro, uses dice to control your actions, try to build the best estate in the game including Castles, Animals, Buildings, mines and more.

So far I found it kind of OK. However the game does come with a number of alternate boards. I have been told it’s a lot better game if you use them.

The building tiles have no icons which mean you have to cross-reference their effects every 30 seconds. Plus the tiles are small and the buildings all look similar. This is very annoying and a big flaw with the game components.

The gameplay itself is fine and encourages big combo turns.

The other problem is the mechanics make no logical/thematic sense. I get 1 silver no matter how many goods I sell, wtf? Imagine if merchants in real life did that...

One of these new-fangled "euro-dice games". Overall I enjoyed it, it's right up there with Kingsburg among my favorite dice games. I give it a 7/10, with plenty of room for increase pending further explorations. 

And, there's a lot to explore in this game. Influenced in large part to having different player starting mats for every player, which creates a nice asymmetry and replayability. Stefan Feld's games, more than any other designer (at least based on this and Luna), remind me of clock-work devices, with lots of little gears and mechanisms all interacting with each other. There's so much going on, so much to play with and discover.

The visual aspect of the game is very subtle. At first glance it seems underwhelming, with all the pale colors. But if you look closer you can appreciate the care that was put into the production. The illustrations are all intricately detailed and nicely done. Even the player mat hexes, if you look really closely, have tiny textures that match their theme (such as forests for the dark green). The intricate visual aspect of the game actually nicely matches that "clock-work gears" feel of the mechanisms.

Looking forward to more plays of this one!

This is a good game, but a player aid can really help. It is a tile selection and placement game, but there are many different tiles. The tiles offer bonuses when played and generate scores when a region gets filled in. Dice are rolled to guide selection of the tiles, but they can be modified with workers or with special tiles. So the effects of randomness seem manageable.

Played many times now. I really like this game the decisions are very interesting. Planning is critical, efficient use of actions, and dealing with what you roll. The latter is the biggest potential problem with the game. You have to either work hard to collect die-modifying abilities or accept the outcome of not doing so. Falling  victim to random luck is crappy and it can happen in this game. 

Understanding that the dice might not cooperate, and planning for that is an interesting part of the strategy. Another potential problem is downtime if people think too much. With speedy experienced players this game is great, with those who agonize it can be unbearable, especially with 4 players.

--------------------------------
Played once with 4.

This is a bit more complicated than Feld's other designs. The game plays longer as a result and is more prone to analysis paralysis. However the return on the time investment is well worth it. It's a fantastic game full of interesting scoring options and decisions. 

I'm looking forward to playing this many times. The arrival of an English version will help considerably.

We are big fans of Stefan Feld. This game has a nice setting, beautiful material. It is lovely to play and to see your county thrive. Very interesting mechanisms - as usual with Feld's game.

And, the last turn is very similar to the first turn, meaning the game doesn't grow in complexity and option while playing - what we really like in stategy games.

Trivia: What do Seeland and Burgen von Burgund have in common? Players collect lots of VPs. The winner in both games will have more than 200 of them. A feeling of accomplishment is guaranteed.
In each of the 25 turns players have two actions which can be chosen from a broad array of options to build up their duchy. Mechanically this is a tile-laying game governed by dice that (dis-)allow selecting some of the options. Expect AP to be at work here. Typically, at game end individual players' mats will likely be filled up almost completely no matter which way the players went. It's efficiency in VP generation that's key. There's no destructive element in BvB. Interaction is usually not targetted but definitely provided nonetheless as the game consists of many small races to reach something first.
Upgraded to 8/10 after four plays as it's a good game for two as well.

RATING: 8
Fun and challenging game.  A lot of competition over the right hexes to fill out your kingdom.  

The tough part about learning the game is that each little hex is different and illustrated (no text), so each hex has to be looked up when you're learning.  

Once you play a few times, the game will speed up considerably.

Multiplayer solitaire? Maybe. But the more you play the more tension there is in battling over tiles. The game is very elegant, relatively easy to learn, and makes every turn feel rewarding. Excellent with 2 Players, and scales well to 4.

Pros - The dice limit your decisions enough to keep you from experiencing AP yet you still feel in control.  Very balanced scoring mechanisms and paths to victory.  Every game feels unique but still familiar.

Cons - Very dry.  Pasted on theme.

Conclusion - Outstanding.  Deep enough for experienced gamers and easy enough with enough luck for new players.

RATING: 10
Plays great at all player counts.  Very satisfying to pull off big combos.  Definitely not a multiplayer solitaire game if played competitively. Pay attention to what others are doing so that you can interrupt their strategy thru turn order manipulation and tile stealing.

It's one of the cheapest games in the BGG Top 100.  That being said, I'd gladly pay top dollar for a deluxe version with updated components and all expansions included.

Rating includes play with the following expansions:

Though I admire Stefan Feld as a designer, I haven't felt the desire to play his games repeatedly.  Macao fell flat with me, and Luna was interesting, but lacked the spark of excitement.  I have higher hopes for this one, though some of the complaints I've seen seem valid.

It seems to be pretty easy (at least with the introductory setup) to accomplish everything you need to by the end of the game.  Also, it seems to lack story arc, since you don't feel like you're ramping up at the end of the game.  Also, it's very hard to pinpoint where the decisions were made that determined the winner.  I'm not sure if the last item is a good or bad thing.

Still, I enjoyed playing this and look forward to playing it more.

Very good dice Action-point game. Players try to juggle building up regions and racing to complete them before everyone else. Each region has a specific bonus and its quite fun trying to build up a city the way you want to. Multiple boards also lend a great deal of replayability to the game.

[Suggestion]
I will probably play with 4 phases instead of 5. This shortens the game substantially. In the normal game, it becomes too easy to complete everything and I feel that the game loses a lot of the tension.

Less players the better in my experience. Player interaction and a fun pressure ramps up nicely when there are less tiles to grab.

Maybe just a phase too long as there was little to really do or get excited by the 20th turn, other than scrape in a couple of extra points which, if you've smart players in your group (me not included) is meaningless as they'll have shot ahead on the points track with no hope in catching them. The theme and visuals are very very bland indeed and you'll often be checking references to figure out which buildings do what. They are far too plain to be recognisable at a glance.

That aside, I still enjoyed the mechanics of this immensely. Very smooth and satisfying gameplay.

Another brilliant game from Alea. However, in this case the traditional Alea style really fails the game. Pastel colours and miniscule artwork make for a painful experience in recognising the game state. God help you if you're colour blind. 
There is placement of tiles vaguely remeniscent of Glen More, collection of tiles via dice rolling (very broadly restricted), two actions a turn and bonus actions galore. 
Specialising is encouraged with bonus VP tiles available for nearly every aspect. Is it balanced? Possibly but probably not. I would pick it up if it weren't for the atrocious production.

This is the new hotness for me.  I've recently been introduced to this, and I'm excited to play it more and more.  This is the game that really solidified why I don't like Settlers of Catan anymore.  In Burgundy, regardless of what you roll, you still feel like you can do something good, even if it's just taking workers.  In Catan, it can come round to your turn and you do jack squat.  Thumbs up!

What makes this such a classic is how you only have two dice to work with each turn, but there are so many decisions for you to make.  Shipping goods, taking tiles, building the tiles in your town, getting workers, it all makes for a wonderful experience for those who want to do some thinking.  

Only two things hold this back from being a "10"...first, the components, which are probably the most shoddy components in my collection. Player boards are flimsy and the tiles are just barely sturdy.  This needs the "deluxe" treatment.  Secondly, at 4 players, it just plays too darn long.  Personally, I'm not into games that go THAT long, which makes this perfect at 2 and fine at 3. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
An instant classic that brought me into the hobby. A lot of pieces to assemble, but runs incredibly smoothly once everyone knows what they are doing. The randomness of dice roll is mitigated through the worker tokens + the sheer number of choices available with each roll. If you ever wanted to build your own medival estate, or just want to experience a true classic, get this game right now.

Excellent game with a lot of strategy.  There is a little bit of luck with your dice rolls, but mostly it is base on how efficient you use your die to perform your actions.  Sometime you should try to use actions to deny others from completing their actions to achieve victory.  The theme and the component quality is just average, but the gameplay is where this game shines.

A seemingly very replayable game that uses dice quite cleverly. Production values are a bit weak and there should have been a greater difference between light green and yellow. I also think the turn order mechanism is not the best one. The main thing keeping CoB from being a truly exceptional experience is the very anticlimatic end game. Also, no need to play this with four.

I'm not the biggest Feld fan.  This has a similar feel as Luna to me.  Had some interesting mechanics and decisions but on the whole doesn't make me excited to play.  A 4 player game can really drag.  Each turn feels very samey with the same decisions every time.  I enjoy it but I'm certainly not enthusiastic about it.  Exact same way that I felt about Luna.

The theme is pasted on but we still highly recommend the game.

Many different terms can be and have been used to characterize The Castles of Burgundy. I might describe it as a not-quite-solo optimization puzzle with dice-based constraints and a focus on action economy. Player interaction is limited to picking resources from a common pool and racing to be the first to reach a variety of goals. Everyone typically gets some of everything, so efficiency is required to get just a little more or sooner than anyone else. I can see why this kind of "continually build stuff, continually get rewards" gameplay is popular, even addictive, but in the long run I want something with a little more bite. Said to be better with two, said to be better with nonstandard player boards.

I strongly disliked this game - I'd been expecting complexity and depth, but instead it was all about dozens of marginal gains of a few veeps and massive scores at the end, with very little to connect one action to the next. I'd be curious to see if anyone is actually good at this. I didn't feel like there was a whole lot of game here, though, mostly just actions.

RATING: 6
I'm mostly done with this game. For a year or more I played this a great deal, mostly on boite-a-jeux, which is why it has so many plays. It's a superb fit for asynchronous online play because you can be away from a game for hours or days and quickly assess the situation to make your play.

It's an elegant design with many tiny parts that fit together cleanly. I cannot help but admire the clockwork nature of the design. Yet after many plays I find myself admiring the structure of the game far more than the experience of playing it.

My frustration is that how I play doesn't depend much on what other players do. It's more of a puzzle than a game. Players wind up playing more against the game than against each other. During each phase your options are slowly reduced because players are taking hexes from the main board. So other players shape your decisions, which I like. But most of the time they are not taking hexes to develop a strategy in relationship to yours. They are merely taking hexes that enhance their own strategy, with little or no care to what you are doing. So when your choices become limited you rarely feel that it's because a player is forcing you to change and adopt your strategy. They are merely doing their own thing and the fact that your options are reduced is unintentional on their part.

But the problem isn't that as each phase winds down you have fewer options. The problem is your inability to develop an effective counter-response. While this game is often described as a point salad, it can often feel the opposite: a punishment game in which your options become weaker and weaker as each phase progresses yet for reasons that often feel somewhat random, even when it's the result of what other players do. 

With better players this is less pronounced. People are more likely to make choices based on what other players need. But even with experienced players this happens only rarely, and usually towards the end of the game.

You can get better at this game. Experienced players will typically crush new players. But experience isn't the whole story. The boards are not balanced. Board 8, for instance, is much more powerful than other boards. And some of the extra player boards in the first expansion will hobble even skilled players. Add in the random tile draws, which become more random with two players, since some tiles may never appear in a 2p game, and the result is a game that manipulates the players.

Bland components.  Little interaction.  Boring, overused theme.  And yet this has become a favorite among my friends across the euro/ameritrash spectrum.  There's just something about the combination of mechanisms that produces a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.  

Update: I've lowered this to a 7 (from an 8) based on a few more plays.  While still a pleasant experience, for a game of moderate complexity, I'm not convinced there's a whole lot of depth to the strategy here.  It also tends to drag on longer than I'd care for when played with 3-4.

I think this game works so well for so many people because you can do all the things to get points but you are restricted a bit by your rolls and workers. Also, the turns are quick and the game flows especially with 2 players. I feel different strategies feel balanced (although no one tried an animal strategy yet). The only downside of the game is it's color palette. If the game was reprinted with a new artstyle It would sell even more!

It's a pretty solid game. I like the tactical choices. I'm not a fan of multiple mechanics pushed together, so this isn't my favorite game, as it feels a little dry. The graphic work was not very intuitive, although it grows on you over time. Components are not great, but they work.

It's fun. Lots of choices every turn, but they are limited to some extent by the D6s rolled, which I think minimizes AP. There are a lot of interdependent points-grabbing opportunities. When I looked at the player boards before my first play, I saw the D6 symbols and thought everyone's land would end up the same, an on-rails game. That's not so. Probably the funniest part of this game is the animals tiles—that is, [i]taking[/i] the animals tiles you know would give a huge bonus to your opponent.

Can't get enough of this game! The gameplay is just so seamlessly elegant. Not too much thinking because the dice limits what you can do, but enough strategic depth that you can force different approaches. 

Only, admittedly very minor, downside are the uncharitable components. Obviously the size of the box limited the different playerboards to thick paper instead of cardboard. For the colour scheme, however, there is no excuse. Such a blatant ugliness is seldom to be found these days and it is quite easy to confuse the bonus point tokens due to very similar green/gray tones. Heck, where the hell is BURGUNDY or other red tones, which the cover art and the name implies? Fix this in a reprint and you get what the 10 is reserved for.

A fun game of using your dice rolls to acquire tiles in order to develop your estate.  I've mostly played it as a two-player game which is the optimal player count.  Played once at four it and it lasted four hours so I'll try to avoid doing that again.  Two is good.

A very solid game that is a lot of fun, if not the most easy to read. Some of the iconography is pretty hard to figure out at times, other times it is pretty easy. You get used to it, but I do wish it was a bit prettier. Still, the gameplay is very good and I'm quite happy to own this game.

This game is frustratingly complicated for me...too many rules, too many references to the rules on what the various tiles mean. The artwork is dull and the component quality disappointing. Wish I hadn't trusted the many positive reviews. Will probably dispose of this one...no point hanging onto something I won't play just because I'm a collector.

RATING: 9
Excellent game, elegant gameplay, clean design, but ugly visually. The mechanics are so smooth, but the art really does put me off. However once I start playing, I forget about that and remember how great of a game it is. Perfect at two players and doubt I will ever play with higher player counts. If a deluxe version ever comes out, it is a definite purchase.

Whoa! This game is way more complicated and much longer than I thought it would be. At first, I thought it would be a simple "just play two dice each turn" game.

Instead, each turn is a struggle to:
- Find out what moves you can do
- Think about what moves are the best (for your plan or to hinder the plans of another player)
- Re-think each in response to the plays of the other players

By the 3rd phase, my brain was pooped-out.

I want to play again for sure, but not right away.

Played this for the first time tonight and LOVED it! Another Feld masterpiece! Once you become familiar with what all the tiles do, it's a super easy, super fast-paced, yet strategic game. Loved all the different options for scoring points and the combination of dice and the workers used to change the die values. Probably my favourite Feld game thus far! (Still have to try Bora Bora, Rialto, and Amerigo). My friends all really liked this one too. Can't wait to play again, hopefully with 4 players next time.

Love this game, lots of options and the comboing is cool. Pretty strategic in a 60-90 min game. I will never play this with 4 again. Waaaayyyy too long for how light and quick it is with 2 or even 3.

First playthrough: one character became the start player and then never relinquished control throughout the game, which severely aggravated the other player who kept having to pick second (player order is a big deal in this game). Basically we were just angry at each other the whole time as a result. We can acknowledge that it's a good game, but we may need to houserule some things to make it okay as a two player experience.

This game really needs better version (which ain't gonna happen as it seems) so people will be willing to try it without shaking heads in disgust of its look. There are so many issues with this game and its still such a [b]fantastic game[/b]!

I'm sure this is a good game.  It just takes too long, way too long.  The decision density is extremely low, on a decisions/minute basis.  It is too bad, because it falls under the "mitigated dice rolling" mechanic that I happen to like quite a bit, but I'd rather play stone age.

+ Easy rules

- Needs reference sheet for the buildings if you don't play regulary.
- To often you are just doing what you can instead of what you want.

This game realy has 2 faces for me. 
At the start of every phase it is fun big time but near the end its just meh. It goes up and down in waves for me. 
Nothing good to grab? Go get a +-1 dice modifier tile yey!
I want tough decisions, more then a can do an this for the whole duration. 
I'm lukewarm for this, yesterday I even turned down a game. Plenty of better games to play.

Kockamenedzsment és birtoképítés Franciaországban. Pont kellemes bonyolultságú euro.

Ami tetszett:
 - Jól van összerakva, mindig tudsz mit csinálni
 - Sokféle út vezet a győzelemhez
 - Az ikonográfia egy játék után egyértelmű lesz
 - Klassz kis kombókat lehet összehozni
 - 2 játékossal jól pörög (még 3-mal is oké)
 - mindig lehet érezni, hogy haladsz előre és ez jó

Semleges:
 - grafika, ami sokan szidnak és tényleg nem eyecandy, de nekem nem fáj
 - melós kipakolni: Igen. És? Lusták vagytok! :)

Ami nem tetszett:
 - 4 játékossal már nagyon lassú lesz a játék
 - 2 játékosnál nem fog minden épületlapka bekerülni a játékba, ezért, ha szerencsétlenül vettél pontot adó fejlesztést, akkor bizony így jártál


2 játékos esetén érdemes lehet a fórum variant szekciójában leírtak közül valamelyiket alkalmazni és előre kiszedni minden lapkatípusból x darabot, hogy egy kicsit kiszámíthatóbb legyen a játék, ez határozottan segít a tervezhetőségen.

I hate point salad games in general, and Stephan Felt games in particular, and this one is the best example why. Roll dice, play cards by applying impossible to remember iconography, and when you do you count most sheep, most pastures, most lakes and be done with it. I don't understand what anybody sees in this crap.
Will actively avoid having to play this, all felt games feel like I wasted an hour of my life, and I don't like that at all.

Very good game and one of my favorite two player games for playing with my wife. Good amount of strategy and luck mitigation with the dice is very good and a very balanced game.

Played once. No problem with the rules; no mistakes in playing, I think. But slow to play.

1) Game seems too long. At 16-18 turns, it would have seemed the right time to end, but the game goes 25 turns...so it just dragged and dragged.

2) The pastures scoring just seem too make or brake for victory (or at least, contention).

I might play again with different maps, but then again, it's certainly not on my list to do so soon.

I have to say the quality of components is pretty low compared to other highly-rated board games.

Enjoyable game, best played with 2 because more players just add waiting time without changing the game in any way. The problem with this is that as long as both players optimise their current actions, they're gonna end up with more or less the same score, because everything in this point salad is worth points in the end and all the options are well balanced. So there's little strategy involved, and this really doesn't belong in the top 20.

RATING: 6
A very similar experience compared to Macao. Yes, there are (quite big) differences between these Feld's games, but overall experience is almost the same. Burgund is more straight forward and easier to play & handle, because there isn't Macaos' challenging dice system AND every play feels more the same, because there are all the same elements available (compared to Macao, where half of the cards won't be available and you don't know which ones are missing). So Burgund is a bit smoother to handle, but in a same time you'll miss some challenge. I think to biggest issue is the length of the game: it should be a bit shorter - maybe 4 phase would be optimal (now there are 5 of them). At least: play with 3 players, not with 4 because the fourth player bring nothing else than more length.
 
So, overall: game is nicely made, but Macao or even Luna are better ones.
Updated 09/2011: the first experience was right. This is nice, but now need to own it.
Updated 05/2016: the card game version of this game is a better than this: it feels the same, but plays faster. If you're ever thinking about to get this, buy the cardgame version instead of this. You'll save some time AND money!

Fun game. A friend invited me over to try it. Took me a little bit to catch on to the strategy. Normally that puts you in a position to not win, but that wasn't what did it in for me. My friend kept taking the moves I was going to do that the other 2 wouldn't take. So I was gimped by him always taking the move just before me. 

Came in last, but that didn't stop me from enjoying myself. I caught up and would easily play again, better prepared for the next match.

Might be a bit too luck-dependent for its complexity, but it's quite fun if not played with AP players. Even though the main mechanisms are different, the game resembles Macao in many ways and I think this one might be the (tiny bit) better one of the two.

Played several times, 4p.  Meh, not bad, but nothing great either.  Fiddly as hell, with the annoying setup and inter round tile replacement.  The randomness is actually less dictated by the dice than by the tile replacement.  Not bad for a game that relies heavily on dice, but really does not scratch a "dice game" itch.

Very euro with a fair deal of strategic avenues and more player interactions than is immediately obvious.  Quite easy to learn & play, and easy on the eyes (although yellow and green are way to close).  It's fairly original and not strongly reminiscent of anything I know.  The dice are evocative Kingsburg or Troyes but it's very remote.

Its a nice game but there are downsides.  The thing is too long for it's own good and generally overstays its welcome (4 phases would have been enough, our typical games is 2-3h).  Its deep enough that serious players will sometimes AP, making things worse.  Lastly it gets old quite fast.  The varying boards do little to renew the fun and the whole thing is very repetitive.  Space out your plays.

RATING: 10
My favorit game at present. You use your two dice for actions - get a new tile (farm animals, builings, river, castle, mine, or speciels), place a tile (in the right area), sell goods or get help markers to manipulate your dice roll. Only negativ is that the chosen colors are hard to tell apart, especially the yellow and light green. Not for colorblinds! But the mechanics are some of the best I have see so far.

RATING: 5
The game is interesting but it's not something I would be eager to play. I am not excited to play the game, but it's not an horrible game either. There is a slight amount of randomness which is well used in the game since each roll can be used in various ways.

The first complaint is the color issue, not very color blind friendly especially with 3 shades of green. The board colors made it also harder to analyse what tiles are available to buy because there are too many colors. They should have used neutral colors as the board background to make the colored tiles stand out.

Second, at the beginning, all the buildings seem very confusing especially the fact that the yellow ones are unique. At least in puerto rico, there is text on the tile which makes the learning curve easier.

In our game people said they bought more ships than the usual, but I don't find the goods mechanic very interesting. The random placement is almost pointless because there were almost always 1 good in play at a time. I would have personally done it in a different way.

My biggest complaint is the play time. Most people said the game plays within 60 to 100 minutes. It took us at least 2h30 (150+ min) which is way too long for what it is.

So I am not very hooked by the game, but the game does not seem broken, over complex or convoluted. This is why people seem to like the game so much.

LIKE:

* I appreciate the potential of variance in play with the different estate boards.
* The pain of being forced to use the dice results, particularly if you've made the mistake of not having many modifiers can be frustrating but I like this tension between gambling and setting yourself for a good chance.
* I appreciate that the dice modifiers allow you to turn a 6 into a 1 and a 1 into a 6!
* Lots of different methods towards scoring is available.  I'm wondering though if the game basically comes down to who plans for the final few rounds the best and doesn't run out of good options.  
* While the game is largely solitaire, there is still a fair bit of hosage occurring in what you choose to take from the depots, thereby forcing your opponents to keep changing their plans.  
* Be careful allowing yourself to get far behind in turn order as this will give you less chances to select the most desirable tiles.

DISLIKE:

* Downtime is potentially painful in this game.  When it isn't your turn, you should be thinking about your options so you can quickly take your turn when it arrives, but this rarely happens.  
* Some people have expressed concerns that the game ends too late in that they have completed most of their point options.  We didn't see that in our first game, but one person didn't plan well for the last two turns of the fifth phase and had little opportunity to score points while I ran right by him.

I had very high expectations when first playing this game. After all, it's supposedly the 10th best boardgame in existence right now. At first "Castles" didn't meet those expectations. But then I played it again... and again... and again..

This game is highly addictive and there are loads of ways to score points and many paths to victory. It's just a great puzzle of a game and one of the finest euros. My wife and I play this multiple times a week and we're not so much competing as trying to best our own highscores (mine stands at 234 at the moment).

Really like this game and time will tell if I'll grow to love it and come back to it in the years to come.

The Castles of Burgandy is another in a line of Alea box games that came into maturity back when Puerto Rico was released under the line. Ravensburger knows what they are doing with the line of games, and knows there market. CoB doesn't have any flaws, it plays smoothly from beginning to end, and overall its a decent package. That being said, CoB doesn't really tread into any new territory. Its problem is that it always seems like a game you probably played a few years ago, but just couldn't remember the name of. Gameplay is really tight, and flows pretty well, although some of the rules can be somewhat obtuse to new players for the first ocuple of plays. The components and artwork definitely leave something to be desired and it seems as though Ravensburger has slid backwards in terms of their investment in the quality of the components for their Alea games, which ultimately is really a shame. The setting also leaves a lot to be desired as just another bland medieval building game. Yawn!

Il miglior gioco di Feld IMHO al momento.
Sono solo 4 azioni che consistono nell'usare i dadi per prendere tiles dal tabellone e piazzarli nel magazzino o prenderli dal magazzino e piazzarli nel feudo. Ma la differenziazione degli edifici offre una profondità disarmante e di difficile calcolo... Gioco da 20-30 min a giocatore... Perfetto stimola-menti...

Only tested with 2 players, and it's really a lot of thinking and a lot of seizing the opportunities before your opponent. I do like this game and I recommend it to people that like "fast strategy" (like 7 wonders, where you choose relatively fast what to do with your hand -of dice, in this case-, and then pass to a new round!).

[edit] Also works great with more people! You have more options and being the first player is not that important. Also, knowing where to put your starting castle can make a huge difference!

In my mind, similar in "ranking" and kind with Notre Dame: efficient, simple but efficient euro, that keeps you engaged. Alhambra is simpler but keeps you engaged as well, in a similar way with simple things. 

In Castles of Burgundy, I like the relatively fast turns, and the little goals that pop up together when the players are close to completing a district (we try to grab a tile useful for either us or an opponent).

I like that the game is cleanly done. Clean score counting (upside tokens and special powers). 

I do not mind the "point salad" aspect of it: the game felt more like a race than anything, with multiple temporary goals that act as that many strides—more difficult goals that reward the player with a bigger point stride. I do know where I should have prevented my opponent from going that fast on the point ladder, or where I should have thought of a way of going faster myself.

Now, I don't find any special spark in the game, like I find in games like Warhammer: Diskwars, Heroscape, Race for the Galaxy, Magic, Battlelore (second edition) or even Agricola and all its cards.

It's a good euro, with simple and clean rules, and with some obvious goals to fulfill in parallel, which creates some nice but basic tension. Solid but without a spark. I slightly prefer Notre Dame, which is a bit more thematic and has more flavorful powers. In the end, though, the games that enthuse me are those with strong in-game effects, with flavorful and varied powers, etc. So: really solid but ultimately too bland for being, in my eyes, an exceptional game.

This game is a masterwork.  SO easy to teach and play, but SO many decisions.  You can play to get tons of in-game points by completing regions, using farm animals or trading goods, or gather up end game point tiles and watch your opponents' jaws drop as you add up the points at the end of the game!  Either way, this is a fantastic game...especially 2 player!

I am not a huge fan of this game. It lacks in theme, does not have a lot of player-player interaction except for occasionally blocking a spot someone really needs but they can usually get it in the next round, and it lacks the feeling of accomplishment at the end of the game.

I really like In the Year of the Dragon but have disliked or downright hated most of Stefan Feld's other games. (I like Roma as well, warts and all.) I was expecting DBvB to be a pretty by-the-numbers affair and was pleasantly surprised to find it a somewhat original design with genuine multiple victory paths (this is my latest thing). And dice! Dice that are actually used to determine things randomly! They must have had fainting couches and EMTs on standby wherever this debuted.

Ever since I read about it, I had the feeling I would like this game. Yet I have not been disappointed.

As said in several places, I find the mechanics very polished and elegant. 

Concerning the rules, they're concrete and well explained, and you get the hang of it very quickly, as there are very little exceptions or special rules.

Yet, one thing that, in my opinion, lacks the game, is that there could have been an official quick reference card with the effects of the Knowledge Tiles (rather than needing to check out the Rules at each moment). Surely this will be overcome with the greater the number of plays done.

In overall, one of the best games of this style I have played.

I'm not sure that its my favorite game, however I do believe its the easiest game I own to get to the table. Where other, longer, more complex games have an inherent mental hurdle to get over, CoB always manages to appeal. I think its that a player can have some broad strategic ideas but ultimately each turn is its own tactical decisions. 

The timing of the game is perfect. Neither too long nor too short. 

Lends itself very well to a casual evening with conversation and gaming and always results in a satisfying conclusion.

Undoubtedly the "game I'm most likely to still be playing in a decade" in my collection.

There has been a lot of attention given to [thing=84876][/thing] after it came out, particularly as a two player game.  That being said, despite the rave reviews, [thing=84876][/thing] was somewhat intimidating to get started with.  The graphic design left a lot to be desired---in some cases, the muted color palette can look classy (for example, with Old World maps), but here it gave the game a subdued, drab look.  Beyond that, the dice icons and the rest of the iconography on the board made the game look extremely dry and mathematical.  In addition, for some reason, the rules felt very opaque to me.  Although in reality there are only a few actions you can take, just trying to read the way they interlocked made by head hurt.  My wife took one look at the game and gave me an "Are you serious?" look.

And yet, everything clicked and crystallized after we got started.  We immediately played another round.  And another.  In fact, we played several rounds every weekend for a couple of months.  The game is subversively addicting---despite the apparent complexity, the dice rolls provide an elegant way of limiting/guiding your actions (and reducing analysis paralysis).  However, there are still ways to mitigate your dice rolls through the worker tiles.  There is a good mix of tactics and strategy---in the beginning, we were mostly focused on what we could immediately do with a given set of dice.  However, after playing it more, we've started thinking more long term strategy.  Which areas should we focus on?  What type of tiles should we get?  What areas of the board should we push into?  The game also tapped into our like of special actions games---after a while, if we couldn't use a turn to do trigger multiple special actions, it felt wasted.  My wife in particular loves those types of optimization games.  In general, similar to [thing=31260][/thing], it's just pleasant to watch your board fill up with tiles.  

In the end, for us [thing=84876][/thing] lived up to its billing.  This is our second Feld game---we've enjoyed [thing=55670][/thing] as well.  I would probably say that I enjoy the tension/panic of [thing=55670][/thing] slightly more while my wife prefers the more freeform [thing=84876][/thing].  Both games give me a similar feeling to [thing=31260][/thing] and [thing=35677][/thing] (both favorite games of ours)---tension in one game, freedom in another.

The Castles of Burgundy is a sweet Euro dice rolling-tile laying game. I love how the game is built so you can do something with every roll regardless of the results. Pure luck is not a factor and there is tons of strategy paths to work with. I really enjoy the old-fashioned look of the game. I really enjoy playing it with my girlfriend as it more of a ''solo-multiplayer'' game and doesn't have much direct conflict.

I don't know, this feels like Just Another Soulless Euro, but I still like it. The colors are bland, the mechanics are mundane, and the theme is basically non existent, but it still works. As always I like games with a spatial aspect, and although it can be frustrating not being able to place your tiles at times it adds some strategic planning to the game. The tile drafting I'm not sure I'm a fan of having a ton of options at the start of the phase and almost none near the end, and am so-so that you are restricted (unless you pay) based on your dice rolls. 

There's some indirect interaction in the drafting of your tiles/goods and racing to be the first to completely fill a color. However while I'm sure there's plenty of strategy of when it's worth to snipe your opponent or not the game still gives the feel that it's more you versus the game, both from the race against the clock aspect of trying to fill completely the regions before it moves onto the next phase, and the luck mitigation of trying to place your tiles down in general.

The point salad aspect seems to make several diverging strategies viable. You will fill up most of your board by the end of the game, but how you do so (especially with the science buildings), exactly which few hexes you leave out, and when you do so matters. The inflation of points I think makes this game seem a lot closer than it actually is. E.g. I lost by about 7% of the leader's score but felt like I had played much more poorly.

Each turn goes very quickly so despite having 25 turns per player the game isn't extravagantly long. However I feel like this game might not be ideal for AP players, as the huge amount of turns combined with a lot of slight optimizations could drag this game out.

Nice game system. More abstract than expected, missing an opportunity to even give 'phase' a meaningful name ('era' for us).

Still taking too long, in part due to the tiny components on the too-small board with all the cluttered in-yer-face drawings all over it. Those tiles are so thin! Sometimes think we have a Worker on the board, but it's just the one printed there. Wish these images were grayed out instead of being so vibrant that they look like an actual tile sitting there on the board (or mat).

Really like the player mat material! This stuff is great and does not need laminating. The main board should be larger, and less busy. Heck, would like larger tiles, thicker tiles, larger player mats.

Which Building is that? The one with the blue roof, you say? Which one with the blue roof!! The little squished blue roof, or the great big rectangular blue roof?? Difficult to tell apart these unnamed building pictures.

This is a very well designed game with poorly designed components. I really enjoy the feeling of building my village and earning points in a variety of ways.  I appreciate that there is a built in system to mitigate the randomness of the dice roll.  I also like that there are dice. And there's a small farming component. I heart farming. 

I wish that I didn't need to have studio lighting in order to see the differences in the colors in the game. (I'm constantly drawing the wrong colored tiles.) 

I wish the iconography was more intuitive. (I still need to look up what all of the buildings do and what the bonuses mean.) 

I wish the player boards were made of higher quality cardboard. (This game looks and feels like a print-and-play that someone printed out on their inkjet printer that completely ran out of blue and was low on red.) 

I wish the scoring track didn't have a jog at the end. It looks like a blatant design mistake that publisher ignored. "Bah, we're going to market. We don't have time to fool around with formatting." (This is how I imagine these errors came to be.) 

But I really like playing the game despite it's production flaws.

Need to try this some more before I cast judgement on it.  After 2 plays it still doesn't really click with me.  The special building tiles and tech tiles are confusing to me.

Castles is the best dice-based game I have played since Troyes. Castles is also VERY long. I really enjoy the game, the variety, tension, and wealth of options throughout each play however.

I'm concerned that Castles is likely best with 4 given that every tile appears in a 4P game and that there are more available tiles vs player actions leading to each round being 5 turns of great choices not 3 or MAYBE 4 with good choices. I still had a fun time with the 3P experience but there's something to be said for the full player count.

I'm also highly motivated to use the alternative player boards as I think there will be less player collisions based simply on equal desire from a static setup. I think the tension would be even higher, the games more varied, and the competition more fierce at times when the variable boards create uneven levels of demand.

I think it's Feld's best game with In the Year of the Dragon being a very close second.

Just a small suggestion, redesign the playerboards (player-mats?) with only the tile placement areal and the goods and use thick cardboard.
And the buildings explanation on a separate player aid.
The yellow tiles should be nice painted buildings too.
(For example, same like in Puerto Rico, nice playerboards, nice explanation and artwork, and so on)

Normally I like games with a point scoring, but it is a bit long, for what it is. Roll dice, get/buy a tile and place tile (or sell goods).

I don't usually go in for dice games, but this was oddly satisfying.  Largely, I can probably attribute such satisfaction to the sheer quantity of things that any individual die roll could interact with.  There were some tough decisions, which I liked, and some strategic pay-offs that needed to be planned, which were odd since almost all of the game play was tactical.  The endgame is a little bit of a mess (read: points salad), but generally pretty entertaining.

Choices are so important in a game and Castles of Burgundy provides many choices each game turn. I think what makes this stand out more than other games that have choices is that every choice you can make in Castles of Burgundy will benefit you in some way; some more than others but no turns feel wasted. I think that is what makes Castles of Burgundy so tense and exciting despite it's lame theme.

My second favorite Stefan Feld game behind Trajan.  It is an excellent game which allows you to think strategically in order to mitigate the luck of the dice.  The game has some very interesting mechanics where buildings can string together multiple moves.  

My wife loves this game and she tends to not like games that are heavier than Dominion.  

This is a terrible game for AP prone players when more than 3 players are involved.  I like this best with 2 and sometimes 3 players.

Engine building with a dice allocation quasi-worker placement mechanic and a splash of puzzle thrown in.  Theme could be anything, but the game is a blast to play.  Highly variable and competitive every time with different victory paths.  Multiple player boards provide a good differing feel to the puzzle aspect.  Wonderful with 2 - can bog down a bit with 3 - 4.  Yellow tiles in particular can be daunting to new players, but this is otherwise a rather straightforward game.

OG review: may have some down-time problems and could be prone to Analysis Paralysis with 4 players especially.
One-half or one full turn too long.  By the final turn, all players seemed to have accomplished the goals they were pursuing, and the final choices seemed anti-climactic.
The quality of the paper is just ok. The cardboards could be much thicker.

Thoughts: There's a good balance of choice vs reward in the game. There's tension not only in trying to accomplish goals, but in trying to do some of them as quickly as possible, such as small regions that get phase bonuses, while slowing setting up others to be finished later in the game. The technology cards seem to allow many different strategies to be viable and they can do a lot to influence future decisions.

Only played this game with my wife as a two player game. We both love this game, it being her favorite. 

It plays really well with two. It's really fun to try and build up some nice 'chain reaction' combination moves. It's also really nice how there are base boards that are all the same, but then there are different player boards to add some variability to the game. 

We enjoy how there is a little bit of luck involved, but it is not pervasive and the rolls of the die can be mitigated with workers. 

And there is always something to do, even if the die are not in your favor - buy some more workers!

See my comments for Hansa Teutonica. It would appear that this game (despite it's wonderfully high rating on BGG) is not worth getting at this juncture.

It is also sub-ranked on the Strategy Games section (vs. Family Games section) of BGG.

4/2013 Good mechanic, poor theme, way too long especially with more players.  It's repettitive, repetitive, repetitive .. did I mention repetitive? There's goes on and on and on and on for 20(!) round, and each round each player have 2 action - that's about 40 actions each basically doing the same thing: moving a tile from the common board to your pool, or from your pool to your board.

The best 'modified' dice game in 2010-2011. (compared with Troyes and Macao)
The major differences between these games being that Burgen is:
1. Best use of small rolls;
2. most thematic (for buildings only, for others, it's still an abstract game with paste-on theme);
3. Least luck dependent;
4. Most interactive.
I hate almost every other game designed by Mr Feld, this game is an exception that I'd play eagerly, maybe even bought a copy later.
The worst of game the being the graphic design: the drawings of the buildings are just not functioning and we can't recognise every single one of them even till the end of the game.

It seems Stefan Feld loves to make the sort of games I love to play. My wife and I have had great fun with Feld's designs, and this game is no exception. The different player boards, while all equally viable, force players to adjust their strategy every game, and the dice make for some interesting decisions when choosing between a sub-optimal action using the die you have, or a less efficient action by modifying a die roll to get something you needed.

CoB flows smooth, it's fast and the artwork is beautiful. That being said, I feel something doesn't thrill me; probably the fact that anything you do, you end up doing something good or at least not so bad. Winning this game is NOT simple but it has the flavor of a simpler game and this kinda disappoint me.
However it plays very well with 2 and this is always something noticeable. 
After some games, I noticed that the course of the game changes a lot depending on which board you pick: some let you score many points in the beginning, some others in the end. So it could be either tight since the beginning or became a race during the last round.

Castles of Burgundy (english name) is a very rich game in terms of choices to be made.  You only get two actions on your turn, yet they are agonizing because of all that you need to do.  Even though each of you are building your own estate, it seems like every time you need a certain tile, guess what?  One of your opponents just took it. So there is a lot of player interaction.  The many paths to victory points should not distract you from picking a path and maximizing just a few routes. Be sure to get Glad8r's player aid to keep the building tiles and knowledge tiles straight.

Zwei Würfel, zwei Aktionen, schon ist der nächste Spieler dran. So einfach ist es grundsätzlich, aber die Marker lösen weitere Aktionen aus. Um Siegpunkte zu sammeln, gibt es eine Fülle an Möglichkeiten.

This game is Feld's masterpiece.  It is getting more and more fun as time goes on.  My group DID come to the conclusion that Feld must have worked making camoflauge prior to designing board games as the color scheme is terrible and blends in to the background.  Apart from that, the game is brilliant.  The sweet spot IMO is three players.  The game works just fine at two and four though.  

I love the small chit expansions (Pleasure Gardens, goat,...) and extra player boards (Monastaries) you can purchase.  They add tons of replayability to the game.

Really ugly boards and poor production quality are a turn-off initially, but it is a surprisingly fun game that rewards repeated plays. It's often available for $20-$25. This would be a 10 if it had good components.

solid game!
easy to understand game play mechanics
strategies are easy to plan but pleasantly challenging
game pace stays level
works great with every amount of players
just enough random draws to keep each round and each game played fair but fresh
high level of competition without adding much "screw you" type of moves 

-does drag on with 4 players, due to the fact you can't really plan while waiting

two key mechanics that this game executes very successfully is who goes first each turn and you turn depending on what you roll.
whoever is further with a specific type of tile goes first, but if you catch up to them the player who was trailing behind now gets to go first.  This shocked me how fair it made the game.  
You actions are dictated by what you roll but you have the ability to change the outcome fairly easily.

Although its probably to early to say after just two games, I think that the outstanding idea in Burgund, the one that might elevate it above the crowd of action -> VP converter games, is the use of topography. Tying die numbers to the spaces in your realm that can be developed makes it possible and necessary to plan ahead, balancing between the immediate gain of your two-action-punch and the benefit of opening up new spaces, preferably with numbers that a) you don’t access yet and b) fit with your stored building projects.

If this should prove to be true, the main strategic element of Burgund beyond the usual (combo hunting, action efficiency) is ensuring that you can’t have unlucky die rolls, because there’s always something you can do. Complementing that, tactics mainly seem to reside in ensuring that your opponents do have unlucky die rolls, and as can be expected from a Feld game, turn order is very relevant to this.

Since all information on available tiles, free spaces and, most importantly, dice results is available to the first player, the opportunities for messing up the plans of your opponents are manifold and obvious. Not obvious enough for everybody, apparently, because moans about the lack of interaction can be heard for those inclined to listen. I guess that these are the same folks that were incapable of perceiving the interaction in Race for the Galaxy, and will try very hard to say no more than that (just insert a mostly resignative rant about ‘gamers’ who regard anything more subtle than I KIL ALL UR GUIZ! action cards as non-interactive). I will concede that getting hold of that information is actively resisted by the graphic layout of the game, but I guess that this was not an easy game to illustrate and design. The other nit to pick is that it tends to be a bit longish, but this can be partly remedied by restricting your learning/teaching sessions to two players.

RATING: 6.5
A Feld game I actually like, but can't quite put my finger on why.  

It is highly re-playable with a simple game flow.  Between the tiles that come out,the different player boards, and your dice results, no 2 games will be the same.  You can create small little combos with the tiles you play, plus you get to build up your kingdom.  However, the decisions in the game never seem to be that important.  Pretty much anything scores you points so if your first option isn't available, you have a 2nd almost equally attractive option to pick from.  That can make the game feel somewhat light.  In a game where your options decrease as the round goes on, you would think the tension would increase, but it does not.  You will not be punished in this game, at all.  So, it is definitely perfect for people that like low confrontation or just want a relaxing, but still somewhat thought provoking game.

This is a hard one to rate.  Started around an 8 and now after 15 plays (plus many more on yucata), I'd say it's closer to 6.5 to 7.  It's a good game and lots of people clearly love it.  Unfortunately for me, this is one of those Euros I don't find that interesting after I get in 10-15 plays.  Not enough to compel me to pull it off the shelf.  The card game version has taken its place for now.

Would likely enjoy playing someone else's copy sporadically, but not a keeper.  Will get rid of it eventually, once I need the shelf space.

Will not play this 4 player - too long for the type of decisions being made.

RATING: 8
Absolutely brilliant design, this has a place on every gamer's shelf.  Perfectly balanced at every player count, the tile actions are simple to play yet offer remarkable  strategic depth.  While it's a bit tough to teach and the options can make new players feel overwhelmed, the dice mechanic narrows the focus while not completely limiting the options.  The only thing holding it back from being a 10 are the components, which are sub-par even for a euro game.

Great game that seems a little complicated and overwhelming when setting up (to quote my wife, "There are a lot of pieces.") but once you get going, the game provides a lot of strategy and competition as you race to build up your estate!  For some, this game probably epitomizes the soulless Euro - which for once I can see the criticism since for much of the game I haven't found myself thinking themetically, but rather just thinking in terms of pure mechanics (instead, of 'I should build a castle next' I will think 'I need to build this so I can have an extra action').  Great with two players and the game gets more competitive as it progresses as you both are going for similar bonuses etc.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Seems several strategies are viable and the dice do what they should: make things interesting. but ultimately the choices will do more for your victory than your rolls.  I also really enjoy trying to create an over-all general plan for your game, but also optimizing each individual turn, working your two actions in just the right way to get the most out of your turn.

I enjoy this game with 2, 3 and 4.

This is an excellent game. We've only plate switch two mainly and three once, and it works well. There can be some interaction, even though your play on the boar doesn't affect your opponent, there is tension in using the dice. We routinely hide the dice for the people not going. We like it better that way. The different boards add to the replay ability.

1-29-13-Miles says he's obsessed.

1-23-13-A game that lives up to the hype!  What?  Yes it does!  We love this game and already it is playing a bit faster.  Probably just over an hour and it's so engrossing.  Just like Macao that way.  Feld is magic!  I had already bumped it up to a 10, it's just so much fun.  Played tonight with variable player boards for the first time.  

1-15-13-ha!  finally played it and beginning confusion cleared up fast!  Really fun but rather long for us, about 1 hr 45 min for 2p game.  As we get familiar with tiles game will shorten but not sure by how much.  Still, just very fun--Feld is awesome!  Giving it a 9 since we won't play it as much due to game length.

8.0 - Aug 2015 - 4 Plays:  I really enjoy the mix of long term strategy and short term tactics that the game presents you with over the various rounds.  Different aspects of your strategy may be determined by your starting board, but you'll have to evaluate what tiles you most need to grab each round.  Teaching the game is pretty straightforward as well, so bringing someone new into the game is easy.  I would not be surprised to see the rating go up as this gets played more.

It's basically an efficiency game for that reason. Who will be more efficient this game?

RATING: 5.5
I was underwhelmed with this highly regarded game.  While I enjoyed the dice mechanic and the mechanics in general, I felt like there wasn't enough strategy to the game as there are just too many options to get exactly what you need.  By the end, everyone had most of everything and it didn't seem to matter what I did.  There are way too many ways to score points so the calculating of points is cumbersome.  There is very little interactivity or ways to mess with your opponents because tiles are so plentiful and the workers can always change the die rolls anyways.  What you have left is a fairly dry VP engine game.  

Also the graphic design and quality of the tiles is below par for what should be a top class design.  I guess they were trying to make this as cheap as possible because they wanted to appeal to a large demographic like Catan, but the game is too heavy and there are two many icons and rules to learn for that.

I can't help but be disappointed.

A mixture of worker placement and dice allocation game. There is some randomness in the dice but it's limited. Each player works in their own map so the only conflict is in choosing first the resources to pick. It's an ok game but not too much interesting.

RATING: 9
Man, this is a satisfying game. Some strategies are apparent right off the bat, even on the first play, and every turn is interesting in some way. I never felt like I was forced to play a bad turn, and even when I likely didn't make the best choice available I was pleased with how things went.

I like that you can start with one strategy and stick with it, but will need to vary it a bit to snag surprise opportunities, block, etc. It's a good mix, and one I enjoy in most games; it's particularly well-implemented here. Turns are short, downtime is limited (and if someone slows down you can plan your turn in advance), and really everything about playing this is just plain fun. It works.

The boards are great; lots of information in a small space, but not crowded. The components are typical Alea: a bit thinner and cheaper than other major publishers, but not bad. The exception is the color choices, which are terrible; I'm not colorblind and I'm still bothered that "pale green" (in my country, we call this "yellow"), light green, and dark green are all used for tiles. Still, it doesn't really detract from the overall experience; it could just be better.

This game gets an 8 from me, but the extra 2 come from my wife. This is the boardgame that turned her desire to play boardgames of one to appease me, and spend time with me, to her asking to play boardgames, and actually enjoying them. CoB, by all accounts, should be the most boring game ever, but it's really the opposite. The tension it creates both with what you're attempting to build, and what the other player(s) are building is so great, and keeps building throughout the game. It's great, and everyone should play it at least once.

Hmmm...

The good: 

1. It's simple
2. There are interesting decisions to be made
3. There are many paths to victory 
4. It's a clean design

1. The theme is non-existent
2. The components are awful...really really bad!
3. The rulebook, while not terrible, could be more clear. 
4. The art/colors are dull and uninspiring 
5. It seems like the die rolls *almost* don't even matter. While that's good from a randomness standpoint, it's at the cost of excitement and suspense. 
6. Turn order can make or break you in this game (even 2-player). With that in mind, I'm not a big fan of how turn order is determined. 
7. Because of the lack of theme and the "dryness" of the game, it made it feel like the ultimate euro. That is, how can I get the most points? The end. In that regard, it made Caylus seem flavorful and thematic. 

Overall: It probably sounds like I'm really hating on this game. I'm not trying to hate. COB isn't a bad game by any means. I can see why people like it (combos and engine building are fun). But it's just so dry and the dice just aren't that interesting. I'm willing to give it another try.

Traded away...simply not interesting or unique enough.

RATING: 8
My go-to Euro strategy game. COB is a Catan killer for me. There's asymmetrical gameplay and variable player boards, giving this game tons of replayability. Tons of small goals and achievements throughout the game that scores you points, leaving you with a good sense of accomplishment. Setup between rounds is a bit fiddly, but its well worth it. Yes there's dice, but there's strategy in knowing how to mitigate them; so the luck factor is quite small, just enough to make you think about it and plan for it, or else be foiled by it. This is a solid solid euro.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A pretty standard euro type game. I was surprised by how themeless the game was. Also, it had a mass produced feel to it, which I did not care for. Roll dice, select action, place onto board, repeat. After playing a game of this, I took it off my wish list for games to buy/lay with my wife.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Perfect example of how Euro games can be engaging and more than just pushing cubes around and calculating scores.  One of my wife's favorites.  Feld's best and it's not close.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
An excellent, prototypical Euro game that allows for multiple options per turn while minimizing the luck factor usually associated with die rolling. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.75
From a design standpoint, I haven't played better. A dice game done right due to the sheer number of options a player is given within a focused group of actions so they never really feel screwed regardless of what they rolled. Compare this to Kingsburg, which offers numerous options but does so in a far more random feeling fashion. I'm actually surprised this hasn't been done more often in dice games.

I placed it #3 all-time after one play even though I got numerous rules wrong. I highly recommend printing off one of the player aids unless you want to spend a chunk of your first couple of games with you looking up types of buildings and knowledge tiles. I feel like I can play the basic boards 1-2 more times before moving on. The fact that the game comes with multiple player boards is a huge boost. Again, see Kingsburg.

Pet peeve, the manual points out you might need proxies for silverlings and worker tokens. For such a well designed game, it seems odd to knowingly give players fewer tokens than possibly needed.

Rating Potential: I would have to play a lot of other games for this to go below a 9, and it is a serious contender for a 10. I need more plays to further hammer out a score.

Ordered from Game Surplus Nov 16, 2011

I really like the roll and allocate dice mechanic. Plays well with 2 but shines with 3 or 4, imo.

I enjoy that there are several different paths to victory and that experienced players can play other than "starter" boards to keep it interesting while simultaneously providing a new player with a simpler experience.

Runs a bit long if you have some A.P. prone players.

I printed off the expansion boards but have yet to play with them. I'm interested in giving those a shot.

After six games I lower this from a 9 to an 8. I still enjoy it but it´s very much multiplayer solitaire. I don´t like it with four because of the downtime. Three may still be the sweetspot because you get to see more tiles than in a two-player, and the difference between sold and unsold wares is bigger.

The best dry euro! While the theme is completely pasted-on, it still doesn't feel too abstract and you feel like you're building "something". I really prefer games to have theme if they're heavy and VP based, but somehow I don't care in this game. Dice make it exciting and you can try to create complex combos with the tiles or just focus on few things. Hard to describe, but it's a great game!

Rating after one (very long) play:

Interesting game with some involved mechanics which provided for tough choices and multiple paths to victory.  Classic Euro.  The theme is pretty uninspiring though - could easily be transplanted to any number of other eras/locations.

I could be convinced to play this again, but would probably choose other games first, and I certainly wouldn't play with someone who suffers from analysis paralysis.  A reasonable amount of downtime between turns is quite possible, given the range of options available and dependend on what actions the preceeding players have taken.

1st game was 4 player and went for 3 hours.  Even allowing for teaching time by the owner of the game, that was excessive.  Could have gone for another half hour if the venue closing didn't force us to hurry up.

Érződik, hogy több jó játékból lett összegyúrva. Összességében jól működik, de a témának és a mechanizmusnak nincs sok köze egymáshoz. A relatív játékossorrend még a Caylusnál is ötletesebben lett kialakítva, kár, hogy itt jóval kevesebb jelentősége van, szinte alig változik a játék során. Nagyon kevés benne az interakció, szinte egyáltalán nem kell nézni, hogy mit csinálnak a többiek, ami nálam negatívum.

Update: a jó eredményhez muszáj figyelni a többieket is, néha jobban megéri elhappolni valaki elől egy neki nagyon sok pontot hozó lapkát, mint a saját pontjainkat növelni + ha az ember már jobban ismeri a lapkák tulajdonságait, akkor a játékossorrend is nagyon fontos lehet, tehát az utolsó két gondolat sztornó.

Néhány újabb játék után: azt hiszem, megtaláltam a kedvenc euro-mat. Nagyon tetszik benne, hogy csupa jó lehetőség közül választhatsz, bármit csinálsz, tudsz pontot szerezni, mégsem "overbalanced", mert egy jobb játékos mindig sok ponttal meg tud lógni a többiektől.

Újabb update: Az egyik legjobban megtervezett játéknak tartom, nagyon jól ki van egyensúlyozva, tényleg több működő stratégia van, nincs olyan, hogy elhanyagolom pl. a hajózást és akkor tuti nem nyerhetek. A lényege, hogy az adott leosztásból és a rendelkezésre álló erőforrásokból kihozzuk a legtöbb pontot. Mégis, mindezek ellenére úgy érzem, hogy lélektelen a játék. Jól meg van tervezve, jó "iparosmunka" de érzésem szerint hiányzik belőle a tervezői ihlet. A 10. játék után számomra kicsit egyhangúvá vált, nem érzem, hogy a következő x játék bármilyen szempontból különbözne az eddigiektől, azt hiszem erre mondják, hogy kijátszottam. Ennyi játék után már inkább érzem matekleckének mint szórakozásnak.

One of the best Eurogames I've ever played. I really like dice driven actions in games, but what makes this game really shine is how there's something cool you can do on every one of your turns.

You build settlements, you roll dice, you collect resources, and it plays very well at 2, to boot. When this game exists, I see no reason to ever play Catan again.

I do like this game, and I like the dice mechanic. However, there is just a little too much luck involved, but it doesn’t completely ruin it. 

First, I like the theme and variety of options. I like the pieces, colors, boards. First time through is a bit slow, but pace picks up on replay. 

Early on the dice don’t mater too much because as others have pointed out, you have options. The exception is the first turn and getting the 2 Castles immediately as first player. 3rd and 4th player suffer a bit here. But at least ships help change this from round to round. 

Later on however, dice rolls are more important as you have less spots left on your map and so luck factors in more. You can change your luck with the workers (and some yellow tiles) but better for the person who rolls lucky and never has to use a worker. 

The other random factor – picking tiles to put on the board for each phase – also can be good or bad luck. The biggest issues there are the animals that come up and the yellow tiles. Animal farming seems to have the biggest spread of possibilities and this random tile generation can make or break that. Also there are only so many yellow tiles that have end game bonus, so when/how they turn up can be key (and lucky). 

For all the bad of this luck, it is also the thing that adds excitement to the game. 

The only bad part seems to be the time length. As someone pointed out, perhaps 30 min per player. That’s a long game to play to the end and lose in last phase because a tile did or did not come up. 

Still, overall a great game and glad I have it.

This is easily one of the most played games at the house. You never know who is going to come out ahead as there are many strategies to employ, some which score immediately, others only at the end. The best part is the point differential at the end is so low everyone feels like they had a good strategy. With additional maps on the backside, and expansions this has more than enough replay value to keep in circulation for a long time.

What this game does, it does well. Lots of choices to build VP and your estate, tight mechanics, plus some opportunity to mess up your opponents. It's really not solitaire, but player interaction is limited. I like this game despite some objections. With 4 players it really does drag on too long. I will not play this with more than three and it is beautiful with 2. Also, AP prone players brains will explode. The color scheme is "beige, beige, beige". Everything tends to blend in to the board (except the good tiles which are the colors of a very bright nursery).

I'm a Feld fan, and I fully expected to love DBvB (as it used to be known).  My first play was very promising, but my opinion of the game has since dropped with each play.  The luck of the tile draw can be infuriating at times, and when games are 210-207, it just seems like luck makes up the difference in those few points....and our games always tend to be that close and in that range.  There are a couple cool combos that are fun to play, but I think I prefer my super turns in Macao to this one.

[i]Castles of Burgundy[/i] appears to be well-balanced, offering multiple paths to victory.  I have won on the strength of my yellow tiles (without playing a single animal tile) whereas another player won on the strength of his animal tiles (without playing any ship tiles).

Although I am far from good at this game, there do appear to be some basic rules-of-thumb that should be followed to increase your chances of winning:

- Placing mines early is a huge advantage
- Placing castles and animals early offers no major advantage (with animals, be patient and ensure that they match)
- Placing ships is most advantageous during the last round of a phase so that you can become first player during the first round of the next phase (and have access to a full board and black market)
- Placing yellow tiles with in-game benefits should be done early whereas those with end-game benefits should be taken selectively throughout the game

The game scales reasonably well from 2-4 players, as the number of available six-sided tiles is proportional to the number of players.  My preference is the two-player game, for two reasons.  It is a much shorter game (an hour versus two hours with four players) and there are many more opportunities for screwing your neighbor, compared to a four player game (which feels a little more like solitaire).

While it is fun playing with different boards, I think having everyone play with the #1 board makes the game the most balanced.

01/24/12 Played a four-player game. 
- The box says 90 minutes. Ha! 
- Noticeable downtime.  
- The theme (building a principality) and mechanics (dice allocation) are nothing new. That's not to say they are combined in an uninteresting fashion.
- Some see the multiple number of choices one can make on a turn as a sign of flexibility, keeping one from being stuck due to bad dice rolls. But the down side of that is it can lead to analysis paralysis.
- Its not exactly multi-player solitaire. But player interaction is so indirect it sometimes feels that way. Many will find this dull, especially when stretched over 2.5 hours. 
- The iconography at times is hard to decipher. Coupled with the tiny size of the tiles this can lead to frustration.    
- There is no "engine building" so each turn is almost the same as every other. This has lead several on BGG to ask why the game needs to go five turns. As it is, game length can lead to boredom.  
- There are *many* comments on BGG (and in the two video reviews I watched) saying playing with four people is a very bad idea. For it exacerbates the AP/downtime problem a great deal. 

I will play it again (hopefully not with four). But you'll never hear me asking for it, for I've played much better dice allocation games.  

12/23/14 Played part of a four-player game. I bailed out after 78 minutes; I'd had enough. I'd rather never play this game again. I changed my rating from a "6" to a "5".

Another "buy this, to be then able to do this, which gives you victory points" game. Usually not my cup of tea.

Why do I rate it so high then? It must be the tactical nature (strategy is pretty straight forward here); it is also nice to see your small kingdom actually grow; it is nice that the dice limit your choices to an extent, so less AP here ...

Until now, my favorite game of all time. And i lose most of my games ! This is my choice for a rainy day 1v1 game , which is meant not as a battle of wits or strategic depth (Twilight Struggle does this like no other) , but as a get together with casual lightness AND strategic/tactical depth. This is in my personal holy trinity of games (Puerto Rico AND Twilight Struggle are the other two). Love this to death, the custom bags really help

It's a Feld....What more to say.  Many way to make points, cannot do all what you want, ugly board and more chits than you dare care for.  But still, it was a good game.  Probably good with 3 people...less enjoyable with 4 with the down time...  I would play it again.

I've really enjoyed my few plays of this.  Players are constantly making decisions, but interestingly most of the decisions don't really feel like they're working toward any larger goal -- you're generally trying to tie a few moves together to eek out a few extra points.  Since all players are doing this in various different ways, the game feels sufficiently competitive without being highly confrontational.  Essentially you're just looking for cool combos based on the available tiles, but putting those combos together and watching them pay off is a fun puzzle for me.

This is not my type of game.  It goes on for about 10 turns longer than needed.  It is BAD for AP prone players, and their non-AP spouses.  The decisions are not that interesting, since everything you do gets you points.  The game is in trying to do it as efficiently as possible, which leads to calculating and recalculating and blah blah blah it goes on FOREVER. 

I like the spacial aspect of placing the tiles on the map, and some of the neat combos that can be found.  However, there are other games that do each of these things much better, AND don't take forever, AND have more player interaction.

I'm fine with some low-interaction games (Dominion, Race for the Galaxy, Agricola), but those games move QUICK.  The slow, plodding nature of this game, along with the downtime, keeps me from suggesting it.  I can live with once a year though.

This is a really fun tile placement game, with a worker placement where dice are the workers, as well as set collection.  I am really looking forward to try the other maps.  This game does suffer from the same things that most games suffer from that have dice, there is a large luck factor.

Game in a Nutshell: Acquire and add tiles to your own little "island" while scoring points in a multitude of different ways.

Played as: 2,3,4 player

Pros: I quite enjoy the main mechanic of the game where you roll two dice and have several different options of how to use a given die result. This really adds a fair bit of space to play your turn with some tactical creativity. It really balances the level of tactics required with any strategy which one might choose to persue. It's a game I've actually done quite well with trying different things such that I don't feel like there's one go-to way to play the game (though there are perhaps some minor nuances to avoid). Great price point for a mid-weight euro in these times of over-produced games.

Cons: It's taken me about a dozen plays to know what certain building or tech tiles are without having to look at a cheat sheet every time. Visually, the game is very boring... so much so that I probably never would have purchased it had it not been such a great price. I'm not sure the various player mats add enough variety; but perhaps that's just to say the game can feel same-y to a degree even with different player mats. I don't know, I just find myself beginning to wish there was something to shake the game up more after my first 10 or so plays.

Other: One of the biggest knocks for me is that it's the type of game that employs a passive aggressive form of interaction (I get that that's a personal preference). Due to that low interaction though, there's no real benefit to increasing the player count as it only adds downtime and does very little (make a few more tiles available each round) to change the game up.

Best Use: A tactical but relatively freindly mid-weight euro for two.

What a great game. There is a bit of a learning curve on this one. The game play is simple but finding some of the strategies takes some time to understand, at least for me it did.

Tremendous, fast playing game using dice action selection and tile placement. Multiple ways to score points, and loads of replayability. Works very well with two, three or four.

Minor cons (and only minor) are the component quality could be better, especially the art. The theme is pretty much tacked on - almost any building theme would work equally well. These things don't detract from gameplay at all, but would pish the game to a 10 for me if better integrated.

First/learning game was fun. Two hours of play that didn't feel like it. I was first player only once at the start of the game and never was again, but I won. My opponent didn't go for any mines, but had the knowledge tile that gave him four workers instead of two. He was ahead most of the game, but I won on end-game building +4VP multipliers.

January 2016: I'm starting to play this a lot on yucata.de and enjoying it immensely. Upping my rating to a 9.

This game had been lying dormant in my gaming group's collection for a long time when I finally decided to give it a go in getting it to the table. I ended up absolutely loving it, it's a really nice, strategic game of building up your own area of Burgundy.

There are issues, but not with the game. The production makes some of the tile types a bit too similar in colour scheme, which can be problematic in set-up, changing out tiles between phases and putting away the game. If there ever was a new edition of this game, I'd absolutely go for it despite having my own copy of this now.

Gameplay itself is solid, there are many different paths to victory, and it's all about seeing which one will work the best for you. Have enjoyed all player counts I've played so far and it seems to scale well. 

Highly recommend this game, look beyond the washed out appearance of the board and tiles, this is a solid game, well worth your time.

Well, nothing wrong with the game.  Field games usually have nothing wrong, but I just don't think too much of them.  Score here, score there, pick these, place those, lots of scoring at the end.  All the player boards make it really hard to see what anyone is doing, so why am I playing with other people at all?  We are all in our own 'min/max' world and only surface to shout out our scores at the end of the game.

This game is entertaining. I don't know if there's anything new in how the dice are used, but I like the way you can set up combinations using tile abilities to make double and triple moves. I would probably rate it an 8, but the tile icons are a severely lacking, making the game almost unplayable without the player aids. I've played a couple of times now with aids in hand, and I doubt I could play the next game without using the aids either. And since different tiles are on different aids, you end up flipping back and forth between them. It's kind of annoying. Fortunately, the game is fun enough to make up for the nuisances. A great non-confrontational, game for all types of gamers.

[microbadge=1714]

[u]08-Jan-2013[/u]: This game is right up my alley, and once I play it with others (I hope!!), this rating will definitely go up.  There are tons of tiles.  Lots of variety in set up, gameplay, and paths to victory.  The dice mechanisms are very well done.  This is the only Feld game I've played and I wish I could try out others.  Unfortunately, with my mostly solitaire game life, that just isn't going to happen.

Anyway, CoB is really fun.  The way the main board integrates with your personal board and the use of dice and all of the various tile powers...it all comes together really nice.  It can seem a bit fiddly, but I don't mind that so much.  It also feels a tad long, again which I don't mind much, but once I try this with my family, I'm going to need some time put aside to teach it and play a full game.  We seem to be a slow playing group in general.  We'll have to see how it goes.

So far, I've only played solo mulitplayer games and I've used this [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/679446/solo-variant]solitaire variant[/url] with some minor tweaks similar to [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/article/9968634#9968634]these suggestions[/url].  It's been quite a while since I've gotten to play this, and that's a real shame.  I can't wait for it to hit the table some time soon.

[u]31-Oct-2015[/u]:  I've played using the [listitem=2672240]SoloPlay[/listitem] Variant several times now, so I figured I'd add some comments.  I really like this variant a lot!  It's probably one of the easier ones to grok out of all the SoloPlay rules I've tried so far.  The only wonky part is setting up the board.  But once you get over that hump, it's pretty quick to play, feels enough like the multiplayer game, and has some additional challenges for the solo gamer to overcome.  As I've rid my collection over the past two years of several games that only provide user-made solo variants, this is one that will definitely remain for the reasons mentioned.  Easily recommended.

The verdict's still out. Typical Feld game as far as multiple ways to score. Here he uses dice to determine your actions and a player board, that reminded me a bit of [gameid=29839], for placing tiles you gain onto further constraining your actions. Another game of micro-efficiency and combos but this time many of your choices are tactical in nature due to the dice rolls. 12/2013

UPDATE: Bumping rating up 1/2 point. The game comes together if you can create synergy through the tiles you choose. Plenty of tough decisions as timing is key but you can't do everything you want to.

Played it once. The main rules weren't too complex and the symbols used were very helpfull usually. The games offers enough choices to mask the fact that you are throwing dice to determine what to do. You can't always choose what you prefer but the second and third best options are still pretty great. That is what makes it a good game for me. The theme could be replaced by many other things but it works fine with this setting. However, don't expect to be sucked into this world.

An all time favourite, doesn't wear off even after hundreds of plays. 
I can't even tell why, because it does have some aspects that I might normally perceive as negative (shallow theme, quite a bit of administration to do), but not with this one.
I guess it's that it has lots of strategic depth without being too much of a brain burner, because there are no large production / resource chains to work through.
Plays well with 2-4 players, though some plans work better with 3 or 4 players than with 2.

Can be a little slow with lots of players. Two players and/or online play might be the sweet spot. At first appears dull, as if just moving dozens of slightly different colored hexes from one board to another. It's really a game of optimization which is an element I really enjoy. It's probably too overwhelming for more casual players but it's not difficult to learn and anyone can do well. I like it.

A lot to take in at first, but totally worth it, runs smooth once everyone knows what's going on. Very well worked game! Do you research for end game points, grab up all the chickens for big points, or go for ships and grab a lot of cargo to sell....all the while saving money to buy pieces on the black market.

This game feels more like work then other Feld games.  I enjoy them a lot and usually the lack of theme doesn't bother me but this one has so many little moving parts that can be forgotten or just doesn't fit.  Also having to use the rule book to remember what the power of each building or special yellow tile can be annoying.  I enjoy Macao better even with the extra layer of randomness.  Macao just seems to flow easier in my opinion.

Somewhat enjoyable exercise with some interesting interactions in the expansive vp smorgasbord and dice mechanism.

I still like Feld's Roma I and II better since I feel the die rolls have a lot more riding on them and create better tension.  I will be playing this more on Yucata where I don't have to mess with fiddly set up and take down, etc.

Not sure this is engaging enough to keep in the stash.

Sold.  Not engaging in f2f play for me.

Dice rolling all the way through, which provides a never ending frustration. On the positive side, the game does a good job of providing influence to adjust the dice, so that you always have something you can do with the dice rolled, even if it was a terrible roll. This makes castles of Burgundy one of the better dice-rolling games made, though it still doesn't save the dumb, random dice-rolling mechanism of boardgaming.

The design of this game is atrocious. The beige colors with the poor images lends itself to a game that looks twenty years older than it actually is. But ignore all of that. Seriously. I love me design in a game (good art can seriously boost a rating for me) so when I say it doesn't matter that this looks like a pile of wet moldy newspapers, I mean it. The mechanics of this game are great. At higher player counts a bad case of AP can drag the game out but that's a player issue not a game issue. This game is great.

Kockavezérelt lapkalehelyezős, elegáns euro game. Igazából, ha nem lenne ráírva a dobozára, hogy Feld mester tervezte, már a játékszabályzat alapján megmondtam volna a Notre Dame és a Bruges után, hogy ez is a német tervező zseni íróasztalának fiókjából hódította meg a világot.

Amint a fenti cirkálmányos mondatom már sugallhatta: bizony ez a játék igencsak találkozott az ízlésemmel. Kocka ugyan ebben is van (mint a "feldek" többségében), de a szerencse faktor itt is minimalizált (akárcsak a "feldek" többségében). A tematika meg tökmindegy ugyebár. (Ameri-rajongóktól ezúton is elnézést!)

Már az első játékot követően nagy kedvenc lett, 24 óra alatt 5 partit sikerült lejátszani vele és alig várom már a következőt.

Asszem be kell szereznem az összes Feld-játékot...

Ez meg egy erős 9-es lesz, alig elmaradva a tökéletestől. (Fél pontot meg mondjuk a nem túl erős dizájn miatt vontam le, de amúgy meg tökmindegy...)

Standard Feld, standard euro. Lots of choices, lots of different ways to score small amounts of points. Optimization, spatial placement on your own board. Low interaction (hey, you took the tile I needed!)

No matter, Kat and I like it.

My rating is for the 2-player game. I feel no need to play at any other count.

Edit: The 3-player game is good, too.

RATING: 9.9
Typical Feld style point salad. Love the choices in the this game, the game plays in exactly the right amount of time. The last few turns are critical when you know exactly how many die will be rolled and just how many actions you have left, trying to squeeze everything in at the last moment is very tense. Phenomenal game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
First foray into the world of Feld--a very good game: thin on theme and interaction, but great fun trying to optimize your own little estate. Have enjoyed about an equal number of 2- and 3-players games, preferring it with three despite the longer playing time.

There are many moving parts here, room for clever play and a number of viable strategies. Turn order is an important advantage, yet you can win without having gone first much of the time. Animals can rack up a bunch of points, but aren't always crucial to winning. The mines as a source of silverlings are nice, but not always necessary for success. I would say though that players who disregard point-scoring knowledge (yellow) tiles do so at their peril.

A certain sameness set in after a while, despite the variety of playing boards. Perhaps we played too many games in too short a time. [14 plays]

Looking past the lack of theme, and the sad excuse for differentiation in the goods tiles (just six different colours - surely they could have been wheat, fruit, cattle, etc?) is an outstanding game. I often feel as though I'm not accomplishing anything I want to during the game, while my wife fills farms and monopolizes the shipping, but then things start to come together near the end and we have a consistently close finish.

Excruciating. I thought Feld's most popular design would somehow transcend his previous efforts, but instead this is just the same old same old to the max: two hours of opportunistic, micromanaging point maximization. There's barely any strategy, as you're going to have to do a little bit of everything (as usual) to win. Everything you do scores points, from twitching your finger to nodding your head. The theme is meaningless, and interaction is incidental at best. There's no arc to the game; it's just the same thing over and over again. Macao and Glen More seem awesome by comparison, mostly because they are pretty much the same thing in less time. I will never play this again, and you're going to have to work hard to get me to try another one of Feld's designs.

This game is good, but it doesn't quite have enough player interaction for me.  It feels a lot more like solitaire than a lot of other euros.

Another issue with the game is the die rolls do matter a lot.  There are so many situations where I need to roll a certain number, and roll doubles of the worst number.  You are forced into losing half of your turn to workers, and fall behind as a result.  This can be mitigated by planning your outs, but it can only go so far.

This seems like a difficult game at first sight but once you try it, you get away with it in 1-2-3! Based on your dice roll, you either buy a tile, or you place a tile, or you sell goods.  Even though you need some luck with the dice rolls, you can influence it with the worker tiles if you were smart enough to keep some.

Most of the times, there is always an action that fits your strategy. A nice optimization puzzle that also plays well with 2 players. A must have for people who like Agricola where the interaction between players is also indirect. The only negative points I can think of about this game are the poor design with the player's boards being printed on very soft cardboard, the confusing colors and the fact that it can last long with 4 players. But with 2-player it is fabulous and our favorite couple's game!

Besides Twilight Struggle it is the oldest game in BGG top 10 games and for me there is no doubt that it deserves its position in the list of best board games ever.

RATING: 8
Players looking for an intensely strategic euro will probably be disappointed, but this game provides some interesting choices as well as dice rolling that feels "good". There are many ways to use your roll (and you can use worker tiles to change the result), so it's very rare that a turn feels "wasted". 

The luck elements that sometimes bug me are the tiles that come out. If you have cows, being able to pick up more cows can be a great advantage (this might be better with 4 players as all farm tiles come out). Nonetheless, there are many ways to score points and the game has many interesting elements. Those elements, however, are largely disconnected from each other. This contrasts with a game like Puerto Rico where most of the actions depend on other actions.

The theme is not amazing but this isn't a game where I need much theme. The tiles are very abstracted but building your player board still feels meaningful. Overall this is a nice medium-ish euro if you're ok with a fair bit of luck.

Players throw two dice, crouch on their player boards and start to ponder and ponder how to use those dice. These twp dice give you two actions and your main computer isn`t overheating because you have too few options but, au contraire, almost too many. This game isn`t so pretty to look at, but it sure is fun and immersive. Optimizing your every move and constantly deciding between your short term possibilities and long term goals is facinating. This game has an elegant and smooth feel in it.

Jézuska hozta!
Első játékom alatt nem ragadott magával a játék. Csak számolgatás, kicsit száraznak érződött. Viszont a kombózás az tuti dolog! Le is ültünk még egy játékra azóta, és be kell valljam baromi addiktív! Ugyan másfél óra volt, de gyorsan lepergett mindkét játszma. Másodjára közel sem volt annyi kombóm, és a tábla sem telt be annyira (kevesebb bónusz pont), de így is 210 pontom lett az első alkalommal elért 185-höz képest (amikor csak az 5 zöld egybefüggő állatmező maradt üres). Kicsit túlzásnak is érzem ezt a pontszórást (pl miért jár +2 bónuszpont az utolsó körben befejezett területért? mért nem 0 és onnan nő kettesével?) De most akkor mi a nyerő taktika? Tudni akarom!! Játsszunk még!!
2-en próbáltuk csak eddig, mivel így is hosszú, többen nem javallott (egyszer azért kipróbálom).
+ Ciki nem ciki, rohadtjó a kockákat dobálni!! Baromi jó fogásuk van!

Die Burgen von Burgund ist ja jetzt schon ein moderner Klassiker und wird überall in den höchsten Tönen gelobt. Ich selbst habe es erst spät gespielt und muss sagen, dass ich es als sehr gutes Spiel wahrgenommen habe, wenn auch nicht als Meisterwerk. Die Spielmechaniken sind ohne Zweifel ziemlich durchdacht, greifen perfekt ineinander und funktionieren sehr gut. Das Würfel ein zentrales Element darstellen, kann man kritisch hinterfragen, jedoch gibt es im Spiel die Möglichkeiten, seinen Wurf zu korrigieren bzw  zu optimieren. Trotzdem bleibt ein kleiner Glücksfaktor übrig. Die unterschiedlichen Plättchen, in Kombination mit den unterschiedlichen Spielplänen sorgen für Abwechslung. Außerdem skaliert das Spiel in unterschiedlicher Besetzung nahezu perfekt. Für mich ist das Spiel nur leider überhaupt nicht thematisch und an dieser Stelle austauschbar. Trotzdem, unter´m Strich ein tolles Spiel!

My first Feld game.. A very good two player game.. What i like most about this game is every linked move you make with your two dice feels so rewarding, its like loads of mini victory (if i do this, then i can do that, which means i can do that) it feels awesome when everything falls together. And there is also long term strategy to think about, what to aim for to score big point at the end. To do well is all about adapting and working with what you roll, it may not be exactly what you wanted to do, but there is always some interesting choices. Lots of options, lots of thinking.. Shame the quality of production & components are so so poor.. This needs a deluxe version soooooooooo god damn bad.. Played this game oh so many times.. such a good two player, but also works well with more.. 

THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST GAME EVER MADE..

This one doesn't look like much but absolutely hits it out of the park for me.  It was a perfect mix of strategy, luck, player interaction, speed between turns, and fun.

Simply one of the best games I've ever played. This game is all about strategy and planning. I was a little worried that dice were part of the core concept, but the simple and elegant dice value manipulation removed that concern shortly after opening the game. I doubt any other game will replace this.

Interesting but not captivating. Definitely an innovative use of dice. Bland colour scheme and basic artwork reinforces a sense of dullness and monotony. Was glad to have at least tried it out. I'd play this again if it was offered but its not something I'd push onto the table. I really should play this a couple more times before settling on a final rating, and I expect my rating will increase a bit closer to 7+

Buying resources (ships, animals, buildings, skills) from the big game board, and using them to build your estate on your own small game board. Dice.

When I was opening the game and 'punching' the hundreds of tokens out of their cardboards, I was afraid it was going to be a long and complicated game... but I was wrong! The rules are easy to remember after you read them 1-2 times (and there are visual prompts everywhere to help you).

This game could become my Catan (in a way). I played it once, I already think it has a much better balance of dice throwing vs. planning ahead.

This is a pleasant euro game that incorporates everything I enjoy. It is mostly simple to learn, but there is a lot going when you play initially. It's not entirely easy to see what the best moves may be for new players without some guidance from more experienced players. I suspect the game would only get better the more you play it. Great game. This game gets better to me with each play.

RATING: 7.2
Overrated. If you have time and you don't know what to play, go for it. It's like candy crush for phones. Spending 1-2 hours where you don't feel the tightness. Like a point salad game.

Updated to 6: there isn't really anything more than a race with a little tactical planning for the current turn, just to see what others are going for (by observing their dice) and try to take one of their two tiles. And that's when you are the first player! Seriously, no matter how many players you play with, you can never block them as there are as many tiles as players in each action space. You can just get the one tile you "think"  is better before other players and they can still go for the rest of even mitigate the dice and go for another action space and still get points, many of them! 
Again like candy crush, the competition is based on victory points, to check it on another platform (Facebook) and see which of your friends have higher points! 
Note that my review is based on many two player games. There are many better games out there with more strategy and meat than a solitaire tile building.

Updated to 8: It looks like you can have fun with this game after all! There is definitely a tightness going on, because it is a race to go forward on the point track. And the game has a catchup mechanism, so all players race close to each other. As you can see, you have to play it few times before you see the fun in it!

When I play Castles of Burgundy, I can tell it's a really well-designed game, but it still feels like it's missing something (fun, perhaps).  It's really ugly-looking, and by the time I finish a game of it, I just feel...nothing.  I enjoy the gameplay well enough I guess, but I'd just rather play something a little more exciting.

RATING: 7.6
Un jeu intéressant, qui possède une belle mécanique et une certaine complexité. L'initiative disputée par les tuiles navires, l'unicité et la diversité des 24 tuiles connaissances, la course pour compléter l'adhésion d'un type de tuiles au domaine, le trucage des dés, l'aspect "économique" des mines et de la vente des marchandises ne sont que quelques éléments qui rendent chaque partie un véritable casse-tête.

Malheureusement, je déplore principalement trois choses à ce jeu: 1) la qualité et l'aspect du matériel (plaque de domaines très minces, nuance trop subtile entre les tuiles vertes de pâturage vs les tuiles jaunes de connaissances, beaucoup de petites tuiles à observer sur le plateau central et éventuellement sur les domaines des adversaires); 2) un certain manque d'interaction (il peut arriver d'acquérir une tuile surtout pour nuire à un adversaire, mais on peut rarement se permettre des actions "inutiles" étant donné l'espace de stockage limité à 3 et la situation distincte des domaines qui fait que chaque joueur ne recherche pas nécessairement les mêmes choses que ses adversaires. Dans ce même ordre d'idées, j'ai observé qu'à la fois mes adversaires et moi-même avons tendance à peu regarder ce que les autres font pendant une bonne portion de la partie, parce qu'au final, notre propre stratégie passe rarement par nuire à l'adversaire). 3) Dans 90% des parties jouées, le score final est très élevé et l'écart entre le 1er et le dernier joueur est très serré (Il est donc pratiquement impossible de "valider" durant les rondes 1-2-3 si la stratégie choisie sera victorieuse ou pas, et des résultats du style 180 à 178 me déçoivent, je que sois le gagnant ou le perdant).

Bref, un bon jeu, mais après une vingtaine de parties en deux mois, mon attrait pour ce jeu a quelque peu diminué...

Excellent. A very satisfying game play filled with meaninful decisions. Choose the way you want to win with and stick with it, but prepare to change your plan midway. It's even better with expansion as it solves one of the small problem in the base game, is that there's no difficulty filling your castle with only a few vacant spaces and your last few turns were stuck with spaces that seems to be useless to complete now.

EDIT: The more plays I have, the more I am impressed with the simplicity and high replaybility of the game.

2 people, after 2 plays:

I doubt I'll ever become a Feld fanboy.
Luckily this game does not need me to carry the banner :)

I find it way too fiddly (flipping all the tiles over each time) and specific with a reference chart for the buildings (I suppose after 4-5 games everybody will know what everything means).

This will likely not stay in my colletion for very much longer.

Well, it stayed longer than I thought. I eventually had little pouches in the colours of the tiles, to prevent me from having to flip the tiles constantly. Still, sold it after 3 more plays.

RATING: 9.5
Really strong game. Quite a bit of variety when deciding what strategy to take collecting victory points. Almost everything in the game is of value in more ways than one. 

I had to dock a half point for a couple things that are minor. First, while the game gives you tons of options for what to do with your 2 turn actions, optimal choices can be unavailable based on nothing but a die roll. For some this isn't a problem, but for me it makes me feel less in control of my own strategy. This could have been a worse issue if you didn't have ways of modifying die rolls with the workers.

Secondly, while nearly everything in game is rewarding, I'm convinced that building mines is much less valuable than other options. You can get some bonus points for early zone completion, but one silverling at the end of the round compared to the rewards from buildings, livestock, ships (since they allow you to grab commodities and increase your turn position) or even the knowledge tiles, it just doesn't seem like enough. It could be that I just haven't fully committed to this tactic and it pays off heavily in later turns with more mines, but it does seem less effective from what I've played so far. Still though, a fantastic game and will stay in my collection for a good while.

At first I was a bit overwhelmed by the "busy" looking artwork and by the little tokens which come with the game... however, after our first play I can only agree with the many positive reviews and critics: The Castles of Burgundy is a great game! Quite easy rules to grasp and perhaps one of the smoothest gameplays I experienced so far. Almost no downtime. We played a 2-player game, which to me is the magical number for this game. Wonderful strategical game, very much recommended.

RATING: 8
There are 25 turns in this game to build up your landscape. After rolling two dice, players use the dice to acquire tiles from the main board, put tiles to your own board, sell goods or take extra workers. You earn points for completing areas, and more points are earned if you complete them early. There is a racing aspect as well since you earn bonus points for finishing certain areas ahead of your opponents, and knowledge tiles from the board can give you bonus VPs as well. 

This is a very good game. Each turn you have tough decisions, as you want to help yourself, but don't want to leave good tiles to your opponents, but  your dice rolls limit what you can do. It's very tense and engaging. It's great as a 2 player and 3 player game.

Comments after one 2p game and one 4p game.

Not really recommended for 4 players. It just felt a bit too long for its weight. Not sure how long our game lasted but it seems 30-45mins per player is normal. Then add to that the learning game where you're trying to figure out what each building does, it does plod a bit.

Not saying I didn't enjoy the game - really did and am keen to play more. Just maybe next time with 3 players.

2p highly recommended and probably best.

The hardest thing about this game is getting your head around the first few plays. From then on it is pure strategy game delight. Strongly recommended for 2 players (because there's few games this good for 2 players) and still very enjoyable to 4. After a couple of games, there doesn't seem to be to much downtime. A game of many little victories, makes you feel like you are making progress constantly and involved in the game.

The quintessential Feld point salad but the fact that most actions score points does not at all imply ones choices don't matter. This is a game all about efficiently achieving goals and finishing objectives first. The bonus points from completing sections in early rounds and completing colors first is often the difference between winning and losing. The use of dice as an action mechanism with worker mitigation is really clever and gives a good balance between  short term shocks (which create replay value) and ability to do long term planning.

I think the idea of the game is good, but the gameplay doesn't strongly grasp me. Its smooth gameplay, and I can somewhat see its depth, but I think the drab looking board and dice both put me off a bit, not to mention that the gameplay doesn't draw me like other euros. I'm also a sucker for production quality and this is pretty bottom barrel IMO.

In general, I think I am not a fan of Feld since many of his games are nonintuitive and just don't click for me. Why is it that a 1 pip or 2 pip tells you how far to move on a track, for example? Stuff like that in his games annoys me. I like euros, but usually I understand the intuitiveness of gameplay. For example, in Caverna, step on a space and get that space's action. In Cuba, the role cards tie directly to the board. It would be okay if the actions were clear or simple, if it didnt make sense. For example, in Hansa Teutonica, you play a cube, teleport cubes, or you clear a route. Simple, smooth and streamlined. Even in Alien Frontiers which has similar dice manipulation, the board clearly elucidates what you can do, even if its not tied intuitively. In Feld's games, the understanding for why certain mechanisms do certain things are a lot less intuitive (mainly because of symbology) and a lot less clear boardwise and spacewise. There's the side space on the board with the symbols, but a lot of things felt kind of arbitrary and deciphering it was hard for me, at least. Things like "castle gets you another dice result" felt kind of random. Even in Dominion, it made sense as the things in your kingdom are an investment over time.

Anyway, overall, I am not crazy about replaying this again. Another small thing I dislike is how tactical this game is, since I prefer strategy. I know there's plenty of dice mitigation for longterm planning, but I still am not crazy about it, and I think there's many other tactical games I'd prefer to play first. In this one, rolls can make a minor difference and also uncertainty to what tiles may come out can be a bit annoying. Feld gets around this being a big problem by making it point salady so everything has somewhat close relative value so no one jumps too far ahead, but that makes the individual plays and points feel not as power/not as meaningful. Also, despite being a highly acclaimed 2P game, I did not find it that amazing. I'd rather play a different semi-multiplayer-solitaire game for 2P than this one.

I find it very interesting and find myself wanting to play again believing I can do a better job/score more points the next time. My wife is having a harder time with it at this point. She loves games like Carcassonne and about that difficulty level. I scored 120 with the solo variant. I see people score well over 200 in this game though. It'll be challenging to try and improve my overall scores at this game!

Just the right amount of "thinky" but still pretty easy to learn and play.  I normally hate games with dice rolling because of the luck factor, but this gives it a twist in that it's kind of a puzzle when you roll and have to choose what to do based on the dice roll, rather than in a dungeon crawl when random dice rolls basically dictate whether you win or lose a game.

Doubled-edged sword, this one. It's a really enjoyable experience, with lots of choices to make at all points throughout the game; however, it's difficult to do badly, and most games end in a close score. Great for two players.

Excellent rulebook fairly easy to learn, and there is a lot of decisions to make. Our introductory game had massive point swings, and multiple options to score. 

Really a spectacular game. Its a little fiddly with all the pieces and re-setting the board between each round, but well worth it.

With experience players will be able to find some great combos.

This game is simple to play but has tons of depth that I'm excited to continue to explore. I like it with two and was surprised by the 4 player experience as well.

Though your actions are based on the roll of the dice I have never felt like I lost or won by luck. Every time I finish a game I can look back and see exactly where I could have done better.

It can make for some very tense moments as you see one of your precious buildings snatched up by the other player. Super frustrating but in a good way.

Great game!

RATING: 7.5
I can see why this is a very popular game.  Plenty of choices (at times, it might feel like too many for someone new to Feld's style) and pretty quick.

The tiles are tiny, hard to see from far, and the symbol chart has to be visited often, especially because the buildings are not that different visually, so I had to inspect them very closely.  I think I would have preferred the tiles to be bigger and more distinctive from each other.  I don't know if the iconography of the knowledge tiles could have been done better as well or if it's just one of those things that you learn as you go like Race for the Galaxy.

The plethora of different tiles that you must keep in separate piles make me very nervous.  So easy to lose pieces if you are not careful when cleaning up or just playing the game.  I feel like this is one of the reasons I prefer card games, because it's easier to count the components and make sure nothing is missing.

Lauren liked it.

UPDATE:
Traded it away because it wasn't aesthetically pleasant, had bothersome iconography and boring colors, and the sheer amount of small easy-to-lose-hard-to-replace components was stressing me out.

Still, I can see it is a very fun game, but I'd rather try other Feld-like games with less chits and better visuals.

UPDATE 2:

Re-acquired it, because even though my girlfriend only played it once, she remembered it as one of my fun games, so I had to have it back in my library.

I think that first play was just in an off-day for me, because it is undoubtedly, a fun game.  Still would've preferred a nicer visual palette, but it is otherwise solid.

RATING: 9
A bit early on the draw, but at the moment 9 seems reasonable. Might go up to 10 if I become better at the game, or slip to 8 if I don't... :P

The aim is to build the area around your castles (in Burgundy, I guess). You do so by filling you board with tiles. These tiles are gathered from a common area. 

Everything in the game is numbered from 1-6, and your actions are dictated by the roll of two dice.
Rolled a 2 and a 5? You could take tiles from the common area, as long as they are numbered 2 or 5. Or maybe add tiles to your own board, as long as the areas are numbered 2 or 5. You could also sell goods, if the numbers match. And so on. There’s always something you can do.

Figuring out the right move for the right moment is the hard bit. The balance between this and the luck of the roll is brilliant!

Even the worst of rolls allows you to get workers, and workers allow you to change your dice. Didn’t like the 2 and 5? Spend a worker and the 2 is a 1. Another worker turns it into a 6.

Getting the tiles onto your board is what scores you points.
Some tiles give different bonuses, so placing the right tiles in the right order can start nice chain reactions.

The rulebook is a bit of a mess. A quick summary of why you play the game would’ve been nice. Also, some things need to be rearranged for clarity.

Finally, there are a lot of colours in this game, both on the board and on the tiles. Some of these colours are very similar, so you need to play this game in good lighting.
I’m really glad I still have good eyes, or this game would be unplayable...

Good game after first play through.  To me, there seems to be depth to the game play, which can allow for great repeatability. I'm a fan of the non-agression. Its going to take a while to fully understand what every building/knowledge center does but it seems to allow for many paths and avenues to go down to get a victory.  Further, this diversity allows for contingency plans if your  initial strategy is thwarted.

RATING: 8
Castles Of Burgundy is an excellent game desperately in need of a Special Edition. Mechanically it is a well designed city-building, resource management game for 2 or 3 players. (Although it can be played with 4, play time increases a little too much for my taste.) Turns move quickly, slowing occasionally from slight analysis paralysis. End game scoring is a swift affair that isn't bogged down with complex calculations.

Where CoB needs revision is its instruction manual, but more importantly a redesign is needed for the game's overall appearance. CoB is just visually unappealing, which is particularly astounding given that most city-building games usual endgame result is an attractive and unique little district that players can be proud of and often find photo-worthy. CoB has that potential, but falls short due to the murky, bland art design of all of its components, from its box down to the smallest tile.

It is clear that Alea/Ravensberger were trying to keep their costs down when they chose the components for CoB. Victory point and turn counters are just cut and painted wood dowel. The dice are a good size, but generic. The majority of playing components are tiles made from the thinnest possible card-stock. Game boards are of the next thinnest. Although small changes could be made to improve the other components, its the tiles that are really the problem. Tiles represent several elements of gameplay and even varying their thickness would have been an simple way to differentiate them.

The game is way too long with 4 players and I don't like 2 player game that much - so this is only a 3-player game for me. On the normal boards the game ends up with nearly everything build (at least it feels like) so everybody is buidling kind of the same (although not at the same time). The fields seem to be extremely powerful when filled with animals of the same kind and it doesn't make sense to sacrifice and block a player (only with filling your 1 space field). I don't like asynchron play so the alternative boards are not for me.

RATING: 7
A dice rolling game that rewards tactical play over strategic play.  I made the mistake of investing a lot in altering my die rolls, which ultimately leads to less point acquisition because you waste time augmenting your die rolls.  I am anxious to try this game again, but I fear it might be too confusing for my group because the goals and ways to score are not clearly apparent at first play.

I enjoyed this game and would love to play again to get a better feel for it.

As Feld-ian as it gets, half of the game is determined by the layout of the hexes every 5 rounds, the other half by your turn order.  Get in front, and you get to execute your strategy.  Lag behind and you've got issues.  And theme is a bloody joke.  This has much to do with a castle or Burgundy as it does with 15C. feudal Japan.

Still, for a pure math intellectual exercise, this is a better-than-average effort for Feld.  But if you love Feld, you've already bought this and if you hate Feld, this will only reinforce everything you hate.

RATING: 7
Feels similar to Macao, here there are four basic actions. In one you acquire a hex tile - representing a building/castle/silver mine/animals/ship/bonus possibility - and store it on one of three slots on your player mat and in a different action you place it on your landscape (that has color hexes corresponding to the tiles) to activate the hex. With ship activation you get goods tiles - also stored on three slots on your mat - that can be sold for one gold and VPs in a third kind of action. Each player gets to do only two basic actions in a turn and there are 5 turns in 5 rounds. Your actions are driven by your own two dice you throw each turn: each dice allows you to do one action. There are six areas on your mat numbered 1-6 where the hex tiles, that entered the game are on display. The hexes on the landscape of your mat are numbered and the goods tiles too. Your dice throw must correspond to the numbers on the mat or on the goods tiles in order to be able to execute one of the already mentioned three actions. There is a fourth action where you acquire two dice modifier tiles. Each modifier can shift the value of the dice by one. Beside the four basic actions there is a special action where for two coins you may acquire one hex tile per turn. The effect of the hex tiles when activated helps in many different areas. The buildings may allow you to pick or place another hex tile or earn silver coins or dice modifiers. The castle gives a free additional action without throwing dice. The silver mine earns a silver after each round. The animals give instant VPs corresponding to the number of the same kind of animals in the enclosed area. The bonus tiles modify some of the actions or give game end VPs for collections of buildings, goods tiles or animals. Additionally as the landscape fills up with tiles there are instant bonus VPs awarded for completing parts of a landscape and for being the first or second to fill up all of the same kind of hexes first or second. So there is a lot to pay attention to. It is a good thing but it induces AP, so our first three player game was three hours. It is a little too long for a game where you acquire VPs in small increments from different sources. I prefer not to play this with 4, it is just too long.

One of a seemingly growing range of dice-allocation games. This one is a tile-gathering and placing euro. There's always options for your dice so luck is not much of a factor. At first blush I'm not a huge fan of the genre though, so I'm surprised it's ranked quite so highly.

There is a (somewhat surprising) lack of combo/engine building, because all the tiles are one-off. The livestock are the only tiles where you can score repeatedly.

The iconography is rather confusing at first - all the buildings look very similar so reference sheets come in handy.

Players roll their dice simultaneously at the beginning of a turn. This prevents downtime when it is another player's turn, as each player is able to strategize how to use their dice, and have an alternative option or two in case the first opportunity is lost. Additionally, there is a secondary marketplace where players can spend currency to purchase tiles, and save their dice for tile placement.

A player can also use a worker to change the value of a die, which creates additional opportunities, and can potentially mask their planned actions from other players. All information is public, and it is to every player's advantage to know other player's options and how they might intersect with their own plans.

There is interaction where players might be in a race to acquire a specific tile. But given various options for using the dice values, any player that loses a race for a specific tile, has other opportunities. All actions can help benefit a player in one way or another, so there is never a turn when a player feels they have wasted an action. Completion achievements for player board regions and first and second completion bonuses help focus player strategies.

This game has a very tactical feel to it. You are mainly concerned with what you can do with your die roll, although there is the ability for limited future planning.

After another play, I think there's more to this that I had previously thought. You do have to consider what other players are doing, and try going for the types that aren't being pursued by others. Taking quarries early is worth it, it's always nice to be able to buy additional buildings.

I still think this is mainly a tactical game, since you can never be sure what you're going to be able to do from turn to turn. Still, you can have an overall goal, and as long as you have multiple tasks at hand, you'll likely be able to advance something.

It's a game I never get bored to play. The gameplay is dynamic, there are plenty of options... Lots of ways to get points, lots of viable strategic choices, plenty of ways to win...

It's a dice based game where the strategic factor is quite heavier than the luck factor. Brilliant design!!

It's main drawback is the administration part. It's not time consuming if you have the tiles sorted in bags, but it's elaborated. This is one of the reasons I love its online implementation.

The theme is non-existant and the production quality is just OK. I would also love to have more different player boards (available separately).

Tipico gioco di Feld con meccaniche ben studiate e bilanciate che necessitano di una buona pianificazione.

Damn you Feld! Just when you try and start weaning yourself off dry-as-dust Euros, then a whopper like this lands on your table. A use of dice that I approve of is a rarity in itself, and the intuitive yet hard-to-hone strategy set is almost too well judged. Extremely disappointing production qualities from Ravensburger: flimsy boards, mediocre print quality, and confusing colour scheme using three shades of green. Lots of fiddly admin too; otherwise this would be straddling the 9-10 range.

Further Thoughts: You know what? This one gets old fast. After a few games, it's just all about being clinical and fiddly. The (lack of) theme is depressing.

More plays required. It seems to outstay it's welcome by about five turns (one round). This may drop it's rating with more plays...

Update:

I like it fine enough, but it's my least favorite Feld I own, and if I didn't own it, I don't think I'd get it again.

Verdict:

What I Like: The game is easy to play and not overly mentally taxing for a Feld design. The procedural construction on the players personal land mat is (artificially) satisfying in a derivative way. Some pleasant Feldian action/point mutiplication combos are present here.

What I Don't Like: Regardless of the player count the game always lasts a round longer than I think it should, but it is obviously designed such that shortening it via houserule would completely undermine some strategies. The two and three player games are often decided by the random tile seeding (Better guess your early field animals correctly! Hope that one building you need appears!) The art is graphically dull.

Some Extra Thoughts: The people I know who enjoy this game are the people who enjoy building personalized stuff in boardgames regardless of whether they win or lose. Comparatively, I find less (though admittedly some) enjoyment in putting stuff together, so that aspect mostly falls flat and I'm left with a game I'm rather unimpressed with, especially when compared to Feld's outstanding heavier creations (Trajan, Bora Bora).

RATING: 8.5
After just one (and then an instant 2nd) play, we instantly loved it. After some initial phase of getting used to all the symbols and effects, it can play quiet fast with not too much downtime and has a nice level of strategy in it. It's at the same time easy to get into it but also has a nice depth due to the many options. 
The dice bring in a nice little luck element, but due to being able to "modify" the dices it's actually not too much luck, but more of adapting to what you get and what fits your strategy best. 
We only played 2 player games so far, but I think it scales to more players quiet well and has a nice replayability due to different maps and the random element of which buildings are available at the different stages of the game.

A good game,with a scoring system that keeps all players feeling like they are in with a chance until the end. 

The inclusion of a range of different player boards is nice, to add variety for those who have played a few times. 

One criticism would be that you feel quite detached from the other players, and mainly just engross yourself in your own little fiefdom, developing away, with limited incentive to see what other players are doing. There are some features to counteract this, such as the bonuses for being first player to fill all your terrain hexes of a certain type, but this is still a game without many tense of exciting moment. Engrossing and engaging, albeit in a quiet way.

A light euro that goes down smoothly. This sets the bar for how to use dice in a proper way. They guide players to think turn to turn about what buildings are available, how other players will use their dice to purchase them, and how to react to those purchases. At the same time, the players have the flexibility to adjust their dice and their scoring (Tech Tiles) to keep an over-arching strategy in place.

This game adds to the recent number of games using new dice mechanics, but I didn't find this one to be very inventive.  There are a lot (I mean, A LOT) of chipboard punchouts in this game.  Finding the right combinations of tiles that give additional abilities seems to be key, as does getting ships which keep you ahead in turn order.  And you don't want to go last.

Preliminary rating based on 1 play (2 players).

I'll probably never get friends with Stefan's philosophy of game design, yet I can see why people enjoy Castles of Burgundy. It is a strictly tactical game, awful to look at, with a boring setting and no theme or interaction whatsoever. Clever in a way, though; and honestly more pleasant than I had anticipated. And it is NOT a eurogame with a snobbish attitude. It is NOT super competitive. It's indeed far from being a bad design. "Will play sporadically if in the right mood" expresses my sentiment pretty well, with the "right mood" meaning to have appetite for something very different from my usual nutrition.

[b]The Castles of Burgundy[/b] was reacquired* in a math trade 3/21/15.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]I was dead wrong about this game and I made a huge mistake when I traded it. I can see this game getting a ton of play when I am looking for a 2p game to play with anyone in my family (well not Lilly yet). This will probably be the next medium weight game I introduce to my wife and I'm hopeful she will like it.

I just played a game with my son and I think he did a great job summing it up... it's like Suburbia with dice. This means we'll be playing CoB a lot since Suburbia is one of his favorites. I am really looking forward to more plays of Castles and highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a 2p, medium weight Euro.

- Excellent, medium weight 2p game (definitely my favorite player count for this game).
- Dice manipulation done right, everything you can do with the dice in this game is extremely intuitive.
- Streamlined game play, while the game make look complicated once it is set up it turns play very quickly. This game is easy to teach (just don't try to explain all the science tiles at once).
- My favorite family/mid weight Feld title. (I've played Bruges, Castles of Burgundy, La Isla, Luna, The Name of the Rose, Notre Dame, The Speicherstadt, Strasburg and Trajan.)[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (7):[/COLOR]

[i]This is the third Feld game I have played, the others are Bruges and Notre Dame. As of now Notre Dame may be my favorite, but it is currently out of print. I am not sure how I feel about his games yet, which means that I don't know if I like point salad games. I need to play all of these more before I make up my mind, so on some level I definitely enjoy them.

I like Castles but I need more plays before I decide whether it is a keeper or not. I do enjoy how the dice are used to determine what you can do on a turn. And I always enjoy finding ways to maximize points, but as of yet I feel like the game is a bit random. Also the components are mediocre at best. This is definitely one I want to return to and I look forward to teaching my wife.[/i]

An engaging and fun Alea game! I really enjoy playing this one. It may be one of the best in the series. The rules as usual are very clear and easy to relearn and refer back to. There are several double sided boards, all different, for each player to choose from. Plus several more boards are available for purchase. The game is simple enough to play during a work week, yet engaging enough to feel like you really played a game.

I love the mechanic of rolling the 2 dice and using them to perform 2 actions each turn. You can purchase, sell and build all according to the single die result every turn. The puzzle building aspect to your personal game board really is fun and since there are so many boards, every game is totally unique.

It's fun.  Lots of options and different combos or strategies to try.  Closest comparison that I know is Macao, but this seems a little more samey than that, and it seems the dice can screw you over more in this game.  

I like it, but I like Macao better.

2017 update: But my wife and father-in-law love this game, and it's one of the few of my favorite multi-player games that is still great with two players. So it gets a lot of run. We usually use the monastery scoring addition and some expansions with extra tiles.

Ah, one of the first Euros I ever played. And it was my first Feld so I might overuse my familiarity with this game to understand other games in the genre. Castles of Burgundy is Feld's classic nearly-flawless game of building an estate in the pastures of France. To me, this is the most basic and fundamental of worker/dice placement games and always a treat to bring back to the table. It works well with any number and my strategy changes every time I play. Solid and original gameplay with enough re-playability to earn a spot on my shelf.

RATING: 7
A VP accumulation game. Two actions per turn which are constrained by the 2 dice you roll. They determine which pool of tiles you can buy from (and you're racing the other players to pull out the ones you want/need first). They also determine where you can place on your board and which resources you can sell. While you're grokking that aspect, the next trick is to buy tiles that give you powers to get more tiles out faster, or allow dice manipulation, or sell resources quicker. Plus aiming for tiles that get you good bonus points for what you've invested in, or aim to invest in. With 50 actions, plus bonus tile payments and placements, that's a lot of micro turns which add up to 30 or more minutes a player. Generally you're euro-engrossed but there's some occasional downtime. There's no theme, so you're in it for the tactical analysis vs the strategic overlay - this is what I've rolled and what can I do best with it (including should I be spending my dice manipulator one-offs) given this is what I've invested in so far, and this is how I'm aiming to score big and does it fit within that strategy. And if not, do I do something else and hope to return to the bigger picture later. Which provides a decent puzzle-y type game, but lacks drama.

RATING: 10
This is Euro - and not non-gamers or new gamers.  It is not a difficult game.  It's just that there is a lot of symbols and a lot to think about and remember each turn.  Easy to get into for a gamer, but can put non-gamers off.  Having said that, this game is amazing. The whole time there is a tug-of-war feeling to it as you are building and getting points.  There are many ways to get ahead.  In each of the 5 phases of the game, the available options change just a little - not too much to throw off a strategy, but just enough to encourage you to adapt your strategy.  There is no obvious dominant path to victory.  It is often very close and is never over till the very end.

This is %100 Euro.  So for a Euro, I give it a 10.  Every Euro gamer needs this game and if you played a couple and like Euros, then you must have it.  But I believe that you have to score it in it's category.  Some gamers who only like American games may not rate this high.  But for Euro games, the game design is top notch.

Yup! This fun and wonderful "city-building" game feels like a Euro all righty, with dice and victory-point-salad Feld style. Can't do everything I wish I could do. Nice with the open info, including all dice rolls at start of each round, in order to interfere with other players' plans. Excellent feel to this one. Good balance of everything involved. Much replayability. A Modern Day Classic. My favorite Stefan Feld game of all that I've played so far.

One step up from a gateway.

Great game with (Alea's) lesser components and forgettable artwork. I hope someone someday produces a deluxe version with thicker, bigger tiles, bigger and thicker boards, better rulebook, more estate boards, and better graphic design to bring out the theme and art better. This game deserves better.

RATING: 5
What I liked:
- Multiple paths to victory
- The only interaction is tile drafting
- Nice use of dice
- The theme is thin, but helps with learning the rules

What I didn't like:
- Longer than it should be (2.25-2.5 hrs)
- Very prone to AP for optimizers
- Overwhelming options at first
- Very little sense of progression throughout the game (phase 5 tiles are the same as phase 1)
- The theme is thin, so it plays more like an abstract
- I HATE the rule about not duplicating buildings within an area--each of my plays, it has messed me up big time
- I don't like the majority-ish race for turn order

NOTE: Both times I played (with different groups and teachers), we incorrectly took only one action per player turn, instead of taking both actions within one turn. Playing correctly would speed the game up (YAY), but would make the shipping race for turn order even more important (BOO).

Ultimately for me the long-ish play time combined with the thinness of theme leaves me hoping not to play it again, although I might if asked. It would be far better with only 4 rounds instead of 5. Probably 4 rounds of 4 turns would be even better.

I agree with a 3.1 weight, mostly due to the vast number of options available each turn.

My first exposure to Feld and I am thoroughly enjoying it. It is a very streamlined game and I enjoy the multitude of choices on each turn. The lack of theme and minimal player interaction doesn't bother me. I am very impressed with this game and my wife seems to enjoy it as well. It is a great combination of needing to formulate an overall strategy but also really focusing on the tactical optimizations of each turn. It is quite satisfying when you can get a powerful combo lined up.

After first play: 

Very nice dicedriven game. Using the dice a little like Kingsburg or Troyes. All four of us playd for the first time and we ended up on using very different strategies. Unfurtunately we didn't have time to finish the game, only played three phases, and I had a very endscore heavy strategy so I was way behind when we quit. 

I think this is a game I'll play a lot in the nearest future.

Have played a few more times now and it's still good. Lots of diffeent strategies. It felt a little like the boat strategy was losing until we realised we had scored too little for the goods.

A Feld classic!  I love the tile placement and the way the tiles carry out actions for you once you place them on your map.  You're in a  constant race to finish sections of colors as quickly as possible, to get the biggest scores for them, and to get the bonus-point tiles before your opponent(s). Acquiring those yellow tiles will often help shape your strategy.  I also like the two-step process for being able to place your tiles on your map.  Nothing but solid mechanics wrapped up in a great game!

3 Plays - Not sure why this is so highly rated by people. For me, presentation is important and this is such an ugly game. The theme is totally non-existent.

You roll two dice and then use those rolls to take actions. That is the basis of the game. However, your board presents a collection of locations for tiles that you can claim (with your dice) and each has an effect when played or at the end of the game. Plus you get bonuses for completing sets of certain types of tiles, which based on your board only allows one tile type to be played in each hex. A great game, that fits well in the Alea series.

I’ve played this a lot two player and only a few times with more than 2. I’m not sure I like it as much with more than two because of the extra down time and less chance of getting what you want each turn. Plus the tile drawing between each round gets a lot more arduous with more players.

The dice as workers is very cool and the special puzzle aspect of laying the tiles in your estate keeps the game interesting throughout. The sheer number of different kinds of tiles and the random way in which they are drawn really help to make each play different and fresh.
After playing it on an almost daily basis at one point it sat on the shelf for a number of months unplayed. We recently pick it back up and I’m still enjoying it, the mark of an excellent game I would say. The reason I haven’t scored it more highly is because it is lacking in theme and the art isn’t the greatest (very functional would be putting it politely), if my wife didn’t like this so much I think it would sit on the shelf for much longer periods.

RATING: 7
A decent point salad to play from time to time, but nowhere near worthy of the praise it gets.  I feel it plays a bit too long for what it is and I never feel a lot of tension in the game because there just seems to be too much opportunity to get things done.  It is absurd that this is a top 10 game.

Turn order is important. I like to be first or second, if I can, but don't use up all your ships too early battling for the lead in player order. Better to wait and take over after everyone else has maxed theirs.

The game has a set number of rounds in which it is played, leading to a set number of actions per game.  Thus, one aspect of the game's strategy is to maximize one's actions, or in other words, find a way to be the most action efficient player.  

I really like that there are so very many ways to play the game and earn victory points.

I don't think I'm the target audience for Feld games.

This isn't a bad game really, it's just the combination of near-zero player interaction and reliance on dozens of tile actions that require constant consultation of a reference that generally make it a pain to explain and teach that makes me dislike it.

The core loop is simple, sure, but the rest is a confusing mess of rules and actions that never really makes sense outside of the context of "well but it gets you points".

I don't demand strong theme, but Feld games take euro mechanics a little too far into abstract-land for me.

It was alright. Took much longer than i thought it would. A little too Euro-y, the only conflict was us sniping pieces from each other. I wasn't really a fan of only being able to lay down pieces in the predetermined spots indicated by the current board you are playing on.

Die Burgen von Burgund richiede un atto di fede: icomponenti (la plancia personale, quella comune e gli esagoni) sono di una bruttezza rara. 

Ma è un gioco di Feld, l'uomo che mette in ogni sua creatura una meccanica originale e azzeccata. In questo caso c'è l'uso creativo dei dadi, che ti fanno prendere tessere e costruire nel tuo territorio.

Il gioco non è per niente semplice: ci sono tante cose da tener d'occhio e molti modi per far punti: ogni zona del tuo possedimento farà fare punti vittoria in maniera differente. A questo si aggiunge la gara a chiudere per primo i vari tipi di territori.

Alla fine mi è piaciuto ma, e lo dico da eurogamer, questo è l'incubo di ogni giocatore di american game: l'ambientazione è davvero attaccata con lo sputo e componenti molto sotto la media.

RATING: 6
I would imagine this game is hurt pretty bad by components, though it isn't too much of a factor in my opinion. The cheap components made this game inexpensive and easy to justify buying.

Plays pretty well with any number, but the gameplay seems to be the best with 3. Another game where the dice work perfectly.

With 4 player, I would definitely probably choose a different game, as there are better at that count, and it tends to drag on.

This has been downgraded to a 7. Still a really good game, but it makes me realize how important more variability is in my games. It just feels like each game is very much the same.

Downgraded again to a 6 after about 8 plays. The feeling that the game is just the same every time only continues to get worse. This is compounded by the fact that the game feels too long for how repetitive and relatively simple it is. I feel like my wife and I just whip through a game at top speed, and I can't imagine how the minimum 30 minutes on the box is realistic. My guess for most people, even somewhat experienced players, is that a 2 player game will be 45 to 60 minutes at least, and a 4 player game will be minimum 90 to 120 minutes, perhaps more.

I get how people love this game, I really do. There is surprisingly a lot of tension in hoping the right tiles come out, planning your dice and silverlings, hoping you can grab the right tiles before someone else, and feeling like you never have enough time to do everything. But because of the reasons outlined above, it just isn't my favorite.

I hope to get it to 10 plays and then retire it.

I think this has become mine and my wife's favorite game to play together. The board is drab, the bits are not terribly enticing, and there's not really much theme to speak of, but the game play is so tight that it doesn't matter. It's a quick game to set up and play, the decisions are fun, and the wrinkle the dice rolls present is a great mechanic. But, even though there can be a lot to keep up with, it is a really simple game to explain. It might take several plays to understand all of the tiles and the strategies they allow but the game play is simple, unlike something like Terra Mystica. Roll your two dice and take the two actions they allow. That's it. Again, it may take a while to understand which two actions will benefit you the most, the "what" and "why" of the game, but the "how" is really simple and easy to understand. Great game. 

Update: This game just gets better and better. Really easy to understand and play, but a lot of depth and interesting decisions to make throughout.

I like this game OK, mainly because my wife likes it.  She says lets play Burgundy (instead of watching a TV drama).  Sounds good to me.  We've played 10 or so games in the past two weeks and we've become fast and cut-throat in our play.

Still, it is not my favorite from Mr Feld. That is Macao.

This game is on the longer end of the Euro spectrum, and is definitely very thinky (may not be for the AP-prone). It's really best described as a drafting/set collection game, and at times it feels like you're trying to complete a puzzle. Not as brutal as other Feld titles, but still very tense. The dice constrain what you can do, but there are always options.  You're never able to do everything, but how much you do a particular strategy and when leads to some good varied paths to victory.

So I guess I don't dislike this game as much as I thought I did. It's a solid game with 2, fine with 3 but adding any more players (especially ones with AP) makes this game drag on far too long. The choices can be difficult, but most of the time it's pretty obvious what to choose, especially once you get yourself going.

I'm not a huge fan of the "everything gives you points" feel of this game and really I think you could take your score and subtract 100 and get what you should actually be at.

The components are standard Alea and are serviceable, but the color scheme for this game is so drab.

Appeals to our acquired nature as nitpicker.
Exciting by profiting from small negligences of your opponents.
Works very, very well.

The small pale ambiguous illustrations on the counters and the board makes it frequently necessary to browse the rules for their significations.

Thereby the waiting time for other players rises considerably. Mostly you have to await the outcome of the active players descisions, to plan your own turn appropriately.

If you manage to overcome the inital hurdle of memorising all the significations of the tiles,
it´s a pleasure to compete against other brain joggers.

Strong game of rolling dice to determine actions for placement, trading, getting money, etc.  There is a lot to do in the game, however never felt overwhelming.  I liked the options to allow dice modifications for flexibility and its deep strategy.  The many special tiles in this game provided many paths.

The game's interaction is very minimal--basically getting tiles/resources before others or racing to bonus point tiles.  It can suffer from some AP and dice luck.

Interesting.  Only 1 play through but it feels arbitrary until you get something going.  Then after you have something going, the types of tiles you need are not out.  I'm willing to play it more but first run was meh.  I can see where this is either going to find a permanent home in the collection as I gain a deeper understanding and can feel out some strategy or it will always feel arbitrary and be lit on fire or given away to a homeless person to use as a pillow.

A few plays in, we can see the appeal of this fast-playing Euro. Sure, the thematic content is very familiar, but the dice-guided decisions creates a fun balance between the tactics of taking the tiles needed each phase (main board) and keeping committed to a strategy based on the content of the estate (player boards). Gameplay has been greatly sped up and improved with the use of a storage box with labels.

A good game, the mechanisms lock together really well, and it's very streamlined. Only thing I was a bit put off by was the race to finish up sections to get valuable points, but it did add tension to the game. Also wiping/replacing tiles on the board after each phase was a little annoying but I can see the game hit the table often though. Expecting the rating to increase after more plays.

Edit: After playing the game a few more times, and with fewer rule mistakes i might add, it's remains a solid experience. Very good game, looking forward to playing it more, although not a definite favorite.

I swear, I win this game without trying every single time.  I don't know how to win, I don't know what's good to do, I just happen to win.  Theoretically, you block your opponents from picking up tiles they need, and you try to make large groupings of tiles for exponential point gain.  In practice, it's mostly about trying to get your dice to work with you.

It's long, it's tedious, you don't honestly get to do a whole lot.  If the game was designed to be the length of just a single round, it'd probably be really fun.

Solid dice placement game.  I wish the iconography was clearer and the color palate less muted (I can never tell those darn building apart!). You can pull off some intereting combos at times, which I like. I think it runs about 15% longer than I would prefer for the weight of the game and the kinds of choices you get to make.

You complete a region of your game board, and you score a small bonus because it was a small region, but a big bonus because it's early in the game, and a medium bonus because you were the second one to complete all the regions of that type. I just wish the scoring and gameplay was a little more elegant.

(01/18) I love this game. Some friends of mine think it is too mathy, but they are just watching the insides of the game. It is such an elegant, clean game, that's become a classic.

Many people make fun of it's looks, but I think it is good as it is, it doesn't detract from the game and maybe that is what makes it unexpensive, which adds to its charm and likeness by a lot of people.

It is a "point salad" of a game, almost everything you do gives you points, but you hace to use it wisely in order to make the best of it, it has dice but they can be manipulated in order to get what you want. Making combos with the tile placing is awesome and the different tile dinamics are interesting enough to keep it fun and moving.

Perfect for 2p, great for 3p, haven't played with 4p as it could get a bit slow, but I don't think i would mind it.

This was the first modern board game that my wife and I played. It was an epiphany that games could even be like this; multi-round strategy, balance, smooth mechanics, and just plain fun. 

We played it tonight, years after having discovered it and the better part of a hundred other games later, and I realized why we don't play it as often as we used to: Dice can be annoying.

OK dice lovers - spare the flames - hear me out. The way dice are used in this game, they are an impediment. In a complex game where you're trying to do five things at once and every move counts, it's a bummer to roll two dice and not be able to do anything substantial to move any of your strategies forward. It becomes infuriating when this happens two or three rounds in a row. Sure, you can use dice to buy worker flexibility or fill your deployment area with tiles that may give you other opportunities (including special powers to offset the luck of the dice), but when you're counting on dice to enact your strategy, a bad run of dice can make the game swingy and just plain irritating because your engine sputters just when you need it to roar. It interrupts the momentum of the game. The mancala structure used by Trajan solves this, as does the dock structure of LeHavre. I like the actual game of Burgundy more than either Trajan or LeHavre, but we play it least of the three because of the dice.

I don't mind dice so much in short shotgun-strategy filler games, particularly where the dice are communally rolled and affect all players racing toward a common goal. In fact, the uncertainty of dice can be a benefit in a short game that is all about building flexibility into an engine. And actually, I really like dice if they're used as a dice-draft mechanism, because at that point, the dice are scarce resources and players can compete for the most valuable ones. In those instances, dice add to the strategy rather than inhibit it. But sitting there waiting for a number to come up... is... well, it's limiting because it means that you are penalized for building long complex intricate strategies because flexibility is a dominant concern if you don't want to get trapped by a bad run of dice. Quite frankly, dice used as a move-trigger mechanism feels a bit like the old "move & roll" games to me.

The flow and win conditions and multiple ways of scoring and winning bonuses are amazing. It is a singularly brilliant game with one annoying hitch.

That being said - I still love Castles of Burgundy.

I was finally able to get this to the table. All I can say is "wow, I can't wait to play this with more people, and more often!" The rules aren't too difficult, and the mechanics aren't hard either. There is a small learning curve, but once you get familiar to the icons and how to read them, the game will play smoothly. Great game, I want to play it again so I can bump this from an 8 to a 9 or 10.

What a game! Doesn´t look great but it´s excellent to play, you have a market where every player moves to create the best kingdom, lot´s of choises to buy, trade and develop, the luck factor is controled by the worker tiles. People say that there´s no interaction, but the idea of the game is not that, but moving in a common market to all, whith the same possible actions to all players and all this, in order to make your kingdom generate the most money, it´s just like you having to grow a business. There are conflicts but as lot´s of strategy.

Rating after one play.  There's definitely some good stuff here.  Turn order is critical if you want anything of any value.  Plenty of randomness, but it's manageable between turn order and worker tile modification.

I suspect that my rating will increase when using the variable board rules.  Having everyone use the "1" boards is good for a first game, but I see no value in forcing it past that.  I'm glad they included other options. :)

A real surprise, this one. Ugly artwork, pasted-on theme... but tremendous mechanics. It is actually a quite simple game: you have four basic actions, of which you will choose two (grab a tile from the market or put a tile on your board) some 90% of the time. But both looking for good combos and thinking how to get maximum efficiency from your moves makes this a really absorbing - and addictive - game.

RATING: 7
So first the cons: Yes the theme is a bit dry and "pasted on" and all that, but even still, it works. Color palette is also somewhat weak, which is a little difficult if lighting isn't great and/or you have weak eyes. Component quality is mediocre. Some players might also feel a bit restricted in options even though there's almost always at least one if not a few good actions to take per turn.
Now the pros: Turns and rounds are quick once you know the rules. Despite the small set of options available the permutations grow rapidly and there's nearly always something good you can do. The game is heavily tactical and the dice mitigation is a solid part of the strategy. It is point-salady, as a typical Feld, but there are still some great options to really bump up one's score with planning.
Overall I think I prefer the CoB the Card Game over this one but it's still a solid, good game.

Considered by many to be Feld's masterpiece (although I would personally put Macao and Amerigo above it), Castles of Burgundy certainly deserves to be considered an all time classic of the Euro genre. Fabulous mechanisms, above all excellently implemented dice selection, combine with a greater degree of theme than Feld is typically given credit for to produce a game that provides a fun, engaging, intellectually testing experience time after time. The one down side is that CoB has been given a less stellar production than it really deserves (all the cardboard in the game is just a little thinner than one would like and the game's graphic design and artwork is functional at best) but at least the price point at which it is sold reflects this.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Typical Feld point-salad game, where you have a thousand things to do that all score points, but there is a mechanism in place that arbitrarily limits your options.

In Trajan this mechanism is a mancala, in Macao a rotating compass thingamajig, but in Castles it's simply dice. Not as innovative, but the game moves a lot more smoothly as a result.

Each player rolls two dice, then uses both dice mainly to take tiles from a matching numbered spot on the central board, or place them on a matching numbered spot on a player board. Most tiles are simple, some have extra rules that allow you to build combos. However, keeping things simple and flexible is probably better than following some grand plan, as in the first case you have far more options if the dice don't come up the way you wanted.

In the end the players do fairly similar things in building up their princedom on their player board, but timing and efficiency makes the difference between winning and losing.

A pleasant way to spend the time; who doesn't like to build things and get points for that? Probably my favorite Feld, but I'm generally not a Feld-fan. I like straight paths, clear goals and tense competition, and like most Felds this delivers a multidirectional points-for-everyone personal puzzle game instead.

Enjoying this on Yucata, so can elaborate since my 1 face to face play.

A gamers version of bingo? Feels like it, as a random number (1-6) indicates tile placement, however being a game there are elements that modify the number value. Also tile placement is generally a 2 step affair: firstly drafting a hex tile (according to die roll or modified) onto one of your 3 vacant (off the board) spaces, then secondly from one of those spaces onto the board filled with hexes of different colours and die face values. Your placement is restrained by matching colour of hex, die roll or modified and next to an already placed hex. The game even comes with various board with different configurations of the hex colours and numbers....Bingo anyone?

I think what really makes this game addictive is the gratification of filling in areas of the same colour, a visual set collecting motive as the last placement in the area scores vps (variable depending on number of hexes) but filling all the (sometimes scattered) areas of the same colour gives an endgame bonus. So like bingo there is the drive to fill your board in, but as it is a gamers version there are synergies and kickers to fill in the board quicker (generally as you roll two dice you only have 2 actions per turn). Thankfully there are no kickbacks in the game only unlucky rolls which can't be modified, and there is little interaction except denying an opponent a valued tile from the draft. So a safe choice to play, but I feel the face to face had bloated turns and the scores are too for my taste.

Went in with high hopes for this high-rated game and was totally disappointed. Not only I didn't enjoy it, I was disgusted. Time consuming set up and fiddly. Lots of small different color tiles with lots of iconography on them which you still had to look up the meanings. Irrelevant theme. Everybody doing their own thing. Roll the dice and grab some tiles the dice limits you to and place them on your board. Felt like work not a game to enjoy. It's unlikely I play this again. So many better games so little time.

Plays best with 2. Good with 3. Do not play this with 4!

What I like about this game:
- only 2 actions each turn; but with clever use you can get more actions.
- each tile you buy has an advantage. Lots of choices; what tile to buy? Will I go for points or a tile that alters the rules?
- tension in being first to get bonus points.
- the rounds plays pretty fast. Not a lot of downtime. (But may suffer from AP)

[floatleft][ImageID=1365128][/floatleft]After finally playing Castles of Burgundy (CoB) I was not disappointed but I was also not enthralled. I enjoyed CoB but nothing put it over the top for me to want to play it again or rate it any higher. When playing the game I felt as if other player's decisions only marginally effected my choices and vice versa to the point of feeling as if I was playing the game by myself. The overall game felt like a series of tactical choices where strategic planning was minimal at best. CoB is a good game but I doubt I will seek out a second play of this unless someone else asked me to play.

OK, let's get the obligatory dice comment out the way: rolling 1-1, 1-1 as your first four dice scuppers any degree of flexibility; rolling it again (or 6-2, 6-2, 6-2 for that matter) means you do the best you can: but that's 6 rolls of 25 that blew chunks. There is mitigation in the game, but if you've not had a chance to improve it, well tough. All that aside, CoB is a simple (ugly) point salad that plays very well, with definite tactics and strategy. Hone your dice rolling skills, though!

A tableau style game as you are building out your player mat. Mostly an optimization puzzle with several scoring paths to follow. Player interaction is the indirect competition for scarce resources similar to many other Euros, if you want more "in your face" style game this is not for you.

I liked the way the dice are used to constrain your selection options. You roll and have to select actions based on the roll. You can mitigate the problems by making sure you have modifiers, but that has its cost. 
Also liked the player ordering mechanism - using one of the tile types to change the order. Players can end up earlier in the order by timing the placements.
Prefer the asymmetric boards so players have differing values to what they are trying to accomplish.  

With all the optimization planning that really can't be completed until your turn, downtime is an issue, making what is a long game even longer.

RATING: 5
Castles of Burgundy is a fine game, but it really doesn't get me excited. I doubt I suggest this one, and mostly will play it because others love it. In general I'll be happier to play other games. 

To start with, Castles has got to be one of the drabbest, dreariest games in existence. The components and artwork are very boring. Additionally the colors are not all that distinctive, nor are the various symbols used. It's just passable which is pretty much my summary of the whole game. 

The actual gameplay is really quite well done if you're into highly tactical games. I personally prefer more strategy in my games, the ability to long term plan. Castles offers almost none of that. The majority of the decisions you'll be making in this game are all about the turn to turn maximization of your various priorities, of which there are a million. You really can't plan ahead and think you'll do x this turn, and y next turn, and z after that due to the die rolls which dictate the sorts of things you'll be able to do. Now there are always useful things to do, and whatever luck of the die roll there is should mostly even out over the course of the game so I have no complaints there. I'm just remarking that this trait means Castles is a game of constantly reacting to the position the game puts you in, and very little of the game is spent actually making long term plans or even what your opponents are doing. (I'm sure high level players will point out the subtle ways you influence each other, but in general most of the decisions you're making in this game are all about reacting to the situation that the game grants you from the rolling of the dice, to the revealing of the tiles). 

Many many gamers will likely love this. I think it also really helps players that don't love to have to consider a million possibilities and plan ahead--each turn they just need to make the best move they can and they'll fare well in the end. But those aren't the type of games I love, and Castles is certainly something that I find to be fairly mundane. Whatever magic is here that makes so many dearly love it, I don't see it. In the end it's an aggressively mediocre game to me. Nothing about it makes me hate it or even think it is a bad game, but literally nothing about it makes me excited to play it.

I didn’t think I’d like Castles of Burgundy, but I really wanted to be wrong. Sadly, I wasn’t. The game very much wants to be likeable and inoffensive, but it ended up feeling bland. The points dished out on every turn made it seem like the game was patting me on the head. “Look how good you did! What a great move! Have some points, and then some more points for getting those points!” I feel like CoB might be great to grab if you’re just starting your collection, but at this point I have games that do all the things it does, only far better and with more fun and more style. While I tried my absolute best to focus on the mechanics and nothing more, the soulless art hurt me. I’m sure the low quality art and components were economical decisions, but it made it seem like care wasn’t put into the game. It also dragged on too long for the enjoyment I got from it. Nevertheless, while CoB isn’t for me, it’s not a bad starting point to figure out which mechanics you enjoy.

I was never really in love with Feld's games, but this was definitely the game that made any kind of affection impossible. 

A lot of recent Euro games really crank on the Action Selection Restriction. You're not allowed to do whatever you want to do on your turn, rather, you must manage a little minigame that will give you permission to take actions, and then the game is tactical point accumulation when run through an Action Filter. Feld is an absolute master at that kind of thing, but I really don't enjoy it. For one, the kind of gamer who owns one of those type of game tend to also own 50 of them, with more on the way all the time. Consequently, that side of the hobby really seems to focus on "testing the waters" of each new Action Selection gimmick. That's not my hobby. 

But additionally, and perhaps more importantly, I find that we interact with one another very infrequently when we play these kinds of things. I'm sure there are groups out there that have turned Castles of Burgundy into a hilarious social experience, but I find it a deathly quiet game of mostly private tactical optimization. There's no reason this couldn't have "1-4 players" on the box.

too long. and with any dice game the best'strategy' is to roll well. Zero player interaction despite protests to contrary by some: sitting around in silence while 1 person does analysis paralysis to see if he can screwanyone by taking a particular tile is NOT 'player interaction', and is not acceptable in what the box says is a 30-90 minute game.

Figuring out how to get tiles on your personal board is an interesting puzzle, especially as with expansion boards each game can have a different layout to work with. Overall this is largely multiplayer solitaire with the classic "you took that before I could" interaction. Additionally, it's far more tactical than strategic as dice rolls limit what you can do. Unlike many other Felds, there's no penalty for not doing the right thing at the right time.

This is a game I would normally despise. I'm not a fan of:
* point salads
* individual player boards where most of the action takes place
* the strategy of compete in objectives no one else is competing in
* almost non-existent player interaction: you opponents just get in your way

I really enjoyed this game because [b]there are no resource cubes[/b]! Instead, there are lots of hexagonal tiles, and the rules to where you are allowed to play them is exquisitely clear -- unlike [thing=66362][/thing]. There's something compelling and visceral in this kind of clarity as opposed to what typical Euros ask you to do: exchange a cube for another cube for another cube for some victory points, a transaction that doesn't have the geometrical and visual impact of placing tiles on a grid.

But there are two resources, silver and workers, but they don't overwhelm the game. It's really about drafting tiles to play onto your own individual grid, but with huge restrictions (from dice rolls) of which tiles you can draft and where you can place them ... the resources are there to help you nudge those restrictions a bit.

However, I really don't like the goods mechanic in this game; to me, it really breaks the elegance of the mechanic of drafting and placing tiles based on dice rolls.

I've only played this at 2 players. I don't think I'd enjoy it with more.

Until you have played this game it is impossible to realise the depth of tactics and strategy present in this game. The only slight weakness is that there are many tiles in the game that need to checked against the rules to work out what they do. Essentially you take tiles and place them in your domain based on die rolls. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Description:
This is a tile laying, action selection game. You will have 4 basic actions to choose from. How you can use those actions are restricted by what number you roll. You will compete with other players to pull tiles from the center of the board and get them to your player mat. Once on your mat, you will slowly build out your little dominion. You'll build some harbors, markets, castles, pastures etc. With each building providing you with an additional benefit. You will be attempting to chain these bonuses to create the perfect turn.

Pros:
1. Brain Burner - This is a Stefan Feld game, so you will be staring at the board, burning your brain, trying to figure out how to eek out that 1 additional action you need to get that extra tile.
2. Flexible - Your strategy can turn on a dime and it won't impact you're overall score. In fact, you will likely have to pivot several times during the game as you adapt to what tiles are available.
3. Multiple Routes - There are multiple routes to victory. There doesn't seem to be one way to win. Instead, you will likely need to dabble in a bit of each strategy as you adapt to the board.

Cons:
1. Length - This games seems to take just a touch longer than I want it too. As we play through the last round, I usually find myself wishing the prior round was where the game ended. 
2. Quality - This game has fairly poor components. The good news is that it keeps the cost down, but I'd rather pay a few extra bucks for thicker tiles and better player mats.

Summary:
Great game at an affordable price. This is a classic Feld game that will burn your brain. However, I think this game is much more straight forward than most of his other games. Additionally, this game works very well at all player counts.

Honestly, I seem to love Stefan Feld games. At least the five I own. My family likes games without a lot of "take-that" towards the other players and his games allow multiple paths to victory without getting in each others way too much. Some people love this, like me, others like the opposite.

Burgandy is an engine building game that feels like it's exactly the reverse of what a good euro ought to be: complex enough to be unintuitive, but simple enough that optimizing your turn is often mechanical and lacks the feeling of accomplishment.

Game difficulty doesn't stem from navigating a thoughtful puzzle fraught with though decisions, but rather from piecing together the best choices available to you as dictated by dice rolls.

No thanks.

Man, it stands up to the hype. I have played the card game roughly 20 times, but always wanted to play the original game. It's certainly richer in strategy. The knowledge tiles, the spatial element, and the point salad are all amping this one up to the next level. Now, that is not to say I don't love the card game. It has some solid strategy with similarly cool combos, but plays in 20-30 minutes. This one is going to push to that hour mark with 2 players. Also, the box size of the card game is great for travel. But, that being said this is by far the meatier gamer game and is the perfect length for what it is. This game has really stood the test of time. Overall, a phenomenal game. **Wife:8.5

Very enjoyable "multiplayer solitaire". There is some room for interaction, but it doesn't happen a whole lot, especially if you gather peaceful players around the table. Everyone will follow their own goals and interaction will be almost non-existant. EDIT: Played a bit more with 3 and 4 players and there is more interaction, on an almost perfect level for an "optimization euro".

That being said, it is still a very good game. Every strategy seems to be viable, there's no single aspect of the game that can be diminished. There's some brainburning involved, not too much, just enough to have fun even with sunday gamers. Easy to teach and easy to grasp, seems like a perfect step from gateway games to something more ambitious.

The only complaint I have is that sometimes the moves become too obvious. If you already follow a certain strategy, many turns are automatic. I need THIS tile, I need to put it HERE, I need to sell THOSE goods... Doesn't happen a whole lot, but sometimes it does. Minor flaw for me.

UPDATE: After about 20 plays I realized this game is great in any setup and hardly gets old. I think it deserves 9 at the least.

A very good game that combines things I like from several other games...  Parts remind me of Glen More, Macao, Alien Frontiers, Race for the Galaxy (yellow tile abilities at least), and even a small dash of Agricola with building up your own player board and taking resources from a common pool in the middle of the table.  The result is well thought out though, and feels different enough from all of the games I listed that it doesn't feel like a re-hash of any of those.  I'm only one play in, but I already expect this may become a solid favorite.

We have acquired this game recently after playing Castles of Burgundy: The Card Game and boy oh boy, this game did not disappoint. It is one of the best games designed by Stephan Feld and it deserves all the praise that it gets. IMO, this game is better than any other Stefan Feld games I have played (Amerigo and In The Year of the Dragon). 
I knew hype behind this game and its standing in BGG community but still I was skeptical about it. Even when Govind was explaining rules to me, I did not expect much. However it is during gameplay that I fell in love with it.

Reasons I love the game:

1) Deep euro. The game has incredible depth. I love the fact that I can plan 2-3 rounds ahead. I also love that I can plan entire game and the best strategy to get maximum scores even before starting the game.
2) Dice worker placement. I hate dice and I hate it when dice rolls screw me (which has happened multiple times) but in Castles of Burgundy, it does not matter. Due to worker tiles, you can balance your dice roll easily. It does not hinder the game in anyway whatsoever. 
3) Variety of maps. Player mat provides complex version of map on the other side of it. This makes the game lot more interesting. And each map is different from the other. Love that complexity.
4) Replyability. There is enough randomness to ensure that this game will come to our table multiple times. Govind absolutely loves this game which is a bonus.
5) Limited VP salad. I did not like it much in Amerigo and I am glad Castles has it in a limited scale. That makes the game all the more appealing to me. 

Things I did not like:
1) RULEBOOK and COMPONENTS:  Rulebook was difficult for me to understand. It is difficult for me to understand rulebooks as it is and Alea has made it as dry as they could. I just could not read it. Thank god Govind loves reading rules.
Govind and I, we both did not like quality of the components. Player boards are flimsy, token are poor quality and it is just not value for money. Now I understand it is an old game but this is one area where I really wish someone would revamp the whole game.


That is all. Apart from that, there is nothing I dont like about the game. I LOVE IT.

Component quality may not have the 'bling' factor, but this is another solid dice-based game by Stefan Feld. 

Build your province with pastures, buildings, castles etc. Choices of placement & selection are determined by dice, but enough options to vary these using workers or previously place knowledge tiles, plus 'goods' selling options etc.
So many variations and choices!

Great game.

We played this quite a lot lately, and slowly it grew on me. 
I'm not a huge Stefan Feld fan. I usually don't like point salad games, and I think there are better games with dice allocation in it as a central mechanic. But there are situations where this game can be ideal: it's a good two-player game for a night, when you wouldn't like to start something really taxing, I see it as a good introductiory game with a lot going on, and the variability of the different tableaus (especially with the expansions) makes the game highly replayable. 
Luck definately plays a role here, even if there are ways to mitigate this. But due to the relatively short playing time this is not a very serious problem.
An additional bonus info: this is one of the ugliest game in my collection.. :(

Great 2-player game. Classic Feld, in that there are always plenty of options but finding the most lucrative one isn't immediately obvious. Just the right amount of player interractuon in racing to grab tiles and complete certain goals. I would rate this higher if it didn't take so long to play. Thinking about shortening the game by one round or cutting one phase out of each round.

I don't really dice randomness, but this one can execute the dice mechanic very well.

Easy to understand and somewhat deep in gameplay strategy. 
The combo build-up is nice. 

might not work with everybody due to the Theme and gameplay somewhat feel a bit solitaire, but actually have a player interaction.  


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An excellent game. Lots to think about, plenty of options, multiple strategies. Dice are used in the best way: you roll first, then you may spend to modify the roll, then you select an action that the modified roll allows.

There is little interaction with other players; if you dislike "multi-player" solitaire, you won't like this game. But there is interaction in the usual Euro competition-for-scarce-resources way, and you'll find yourself planning your turn by eyeing your opponents' dice rolls and trying to predict how they'll use them, and how you can screw that up.

Scales well from two to four players.

I'm a big fan of Euro games and this is the first Stefan Feld game I've played/owned. I'd heard mixed reviews of his games, but this one plays brilliantly! It plays very well as a two player game (although I haven't played a three or four player game yet) and gives you great options without causing too much analysis paralysis. This game looks like it would be very complicated to learn/play/teach, but is the complete opposite of that.

Wow, the first game you'll play you might not think this game is worth all the hype but after a few more plays you will more than likely be having a blast. Honestly the game looks boring and the theme is barely apparent but looks can be very misleading and in this case that would be true; the game is extremely fun with several strategies that can win you the game and the theme (although not strong) comes across in the game play more than looks. Also the game plays beautifully with two players, which is not often true with other games.

2 actions per round keep this game moving.  Theme is a little thin....I didn't feel that I was building my estate (as in Agricola), I felt like I was tactically obtaining and then placing the best tiles available.  It's difficult to make up ground on the leader in this game.  A little hidden scoring (as in Stone Age) would have been helpful IMO.

Update:  the online implementation at boardgamearena.com is great.  I've had several games online which have made me want to get the game back to the table again.

It looks very complex on the outset, but it's really not. You roll 2 dice, then use each one to take an action. It's actually quite simple. You can come up with very interesting tile combos that will score you big points. As far as "point salads" go, this is one of the best.

nothing wrong with it but not very memorable and just kinda meh on the style front.

Dice allocation, tile placement, set collection, medieval building Euro game.
Weight: Medium.  Number of players: 2 to 4. Scales well.
Designer: Stefan Feld.  Publisher: Ravensburger, alea Big Box series.
Impression: Even we played it wrong in the beginning it was very interesting and exciting Euro game. After a while it became one of my favorites, especially when we introduced different board variations. It is the best representation how luck and planning can be combined to the best results. You roll 2 dice each turn and those numbers are narrowing down actions you can take, and there is always something useful to do, even to mitigate dice results.

I can understand why this game is revered.  It is easy to play and has an amazing depth of strategy. The play is well balanced and you feel in control of your destiny. A classic euro.

While I do prefer the card game [i]slightly[/i] more, I would never turn down a chance to play this game.  It's just so much fun!

Standard Stefan Feld. Theme is pasted on, lots of little bits, dice-driven actions with sufficient choice to even out randomness, and the standard set of rounds and starting position competition. However, it's a mastery of mechanics and interesting decisions and as a Euro, stands out from the crowd by providing consistently interesting decisions per action.

RATING: 6
Well balanced Euro game, in which your dice roll sets the possible actions to take. There are many different ways to score victory points (trading, cities, pastures etc.) and there is no superior strategy. There are some more aspects  as turn order management and which areas in your kingdom to fill. Luck of dice rolls can be very easily mitigated by  workers.

However, to me this really feels  like a victory point salad and for me this is a rather soulless Euro. In general I like Euros, but here there is almost no theme and most of the game are abstract mechanisms. Even though you are building a kingdom, there  is pretty much no economy built (maybe  apart from the silver mines), which is probably the main reason, why all mechansims seem abstract to me. You definetely do not feel like you are building a small province (as you do in Catan). The art is also rather bland and uninviting.

Worker placement and dice rolling to build up your territory in this abstract but very fun game.  It's a bit long so doesn't get onto the table as much as I'd like, but I do enjoy the mix of luck and strategy.  I've not yet tried the advanced version with the other side of the player boards.

RATING: 9.5
Develop your estate with one of many possible strategies (money, workers, buildings, farms, goods, closing out regions, bonus points, etc.), using dice to select actions and place tiles. The game is long enough that opportunism seems to lose out to a well formulated strategy; but the dice and random tile draws require constant adjustments and should ensure longetivy. Not super-innovative but very fresh and fun. Well worth getting past the rules (which could have been better-written) and tiny components. Feld has proven to be one of the best and most consistently great designers out there. In the running for my favorite game of 2011.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First off, this game is not a good game to play with those who are prone to AP.  It is enviable at some point in this game thus the less players in this one the better for me. As a three player game, it has moments that drag.  if you have no die adjusters than it's a long wait as others are trying to figure out what you do. Each turn is a little puzzle-y and has a bit of a Kingdom Builder feel when you try to get a combination of tiles however, it is much more frustrating as it's hard to plan on others turns because the main board changes so much with the players in front of you.  I don't want to be totally negative as it seems mechanically it's a good game with unique use of dice and it seems that building and watching your estate expand is somewhat entertaining but it just didn't have a fun factor with three. The building of the estate doesn't even feel like you building anything as you are so fixated on getting tiles down and completing area that the theme just slips away.   For me, I'd like to try it again with just two as it seems it would be a little quicker and maybe more engaging.  Just fell a little short for a Feld game and I rather play Macao or even It Happens over this with respect to his designed games.

Clever game. Choices, variability, luck, planning - all neatly calibrated. Roll dice > choose tiles > place tiles > score points. Presents tough choices between filling small areas early for higher points, or holding out longer in the hopes of even bigger scores for the large areas. Offers way to mitigate luck, and a wide scope of variability in bonus tiles and board layouts. The gears fit together perfectly. 

Also lacks drama, conflict, narrative, and interaction. This is the poster-child for a well-designed, accessible, and completely inoffensive euro. For those times when you want to engage with a moderately challenging and stress-free puzzle in parallel with another person. Wouldn't want to play with more than two.

Jan.2011: Traded away Field Commander Napoleon to get a new copy of Castles. After a couple of games, I'm really enjoying this one. A few more games in and here's a major update: my wife agreed to play this afternoon and then later on that night she said she wanted to play again.Wow. Turns out she really likes it. Wife has wanted to play back-to-back games twice in the first week we've had the game. Crazy. And she's won 3 in a row against me too. And by a bunch of points. Ouch!

RATING: 9.02
31-12-2012 Wow, what a surprise this was.  I had read some of the comments and added this to my secret santa wish list, thinking at the time it sounded interesting enough without knowing too much about the game.
Well, having played one game, I like it, a lot.  We picked up the rules as we went as the manual was self explanatory in terms of actions but found ourselves referring to the technology and building cards to get a better understanding of specific cards.  
Can't wait to play this again.

20-03-2013 Still enjoying this game and changing my rating to a 9. Printed a player aid off from the geek.

Why this stays in my collection
While assigning dice rolls to represent different options isn't unique (Alien Frontiers). Draw of the tiles provides the element of luck, but the fun is making the best use of your options available.

RATING: 7
I'm a huge Feld fan, and this is his highest-ranked game here at the geek. However, I must say that I like it less than most of his other games, and see none of the truly original features that help to make Trajan, Aquasphere and Luna such great games. Even the use of dice seems uninspired. Everything works, and comes together to make an enjoyable and well-balanced game, so I'd rarely refuse to play this - but I'd rarely request it either.

(+) Lots of nice difficult strategic decisions to be made and refreshing gameplay. Modular gaming boards offer different strategic choices in the beginning of each game.
(-) Dice rolling (although there are multiple ways in order to cope with this so it's not all luck, yet, at the beginning or the end of the game some luck is involved with rolling dice) and not a very thematic (rather 'sterile') feel to the game.

All in all great game, would certainly play it again!

This is a Stefan Feld game and while it uses dice, I wouldn't term it a "dice game."
You do use dice to acquire and place tiles on a personal board. There are limited ways to place tiles and where to place them. The tiles themselves may give you immediate rewards or ones that work each turn.
This is now a must have for me.

It´s an excellent game with outstanding mechanics: I really  love the use of dices, and when you learn to play, you realize that luck is not important at all. In the other hand, speaking about its aspect, I don´t like its art design, with very bad decisions about picking colours for instance... In general, it´s a little bit dull looking. A pity. But anyway, you get used along with time; if you play it with good light ambient, colors will be no problem. Excellent game!

This is one of the first games that I was introduced to where I said, "Wow! Who designed this?... Want to play again?" The balance of decisions between the acquiring and placement of tiles, from beginning to end, makes this an interesting game.

I'm still amazed at how well the game implements 2 dice without feeling like you were cheated by the luck of the die, and I can't help but enjoy the satisfaction of creating a 4 or 5 action combo with those measly 2 dice. Feld caught my eye with this one, and, as you can see by my other ratings, I've enjoyed exploring his other designs since.

Latest plays shows a lot of promise, I am really enjoying the subtle mechanics that Stefan Feld seems to slip into his game designs.

While a lot of people mention that he is not noted for his theme and feels pasted on, I generally look for the mechanics and what does the game bring.

After the last game new strategies emerged, and look forward to playing again.  Would like to try other Feld titles to see how they play.

26-01-2015. Rated after 1 play. Castles of Burgundy is one of the first Feld games I played. I think the game is ok, I liked it. 

Each round, you roll 2 dice and buy tiles from a rotating/random display. These tiles give you special abilities or points. You score for many things, animal tiles score you points, some buildings give you points, finishing an area gives you points (more at the start) and special yellow tiles give you points at the end.

I liked it, but it didn't wow me. It's good, I can see that but lacks all passion.

I can see why this is the top Feld game.  Macao is still my favorite Feld game thanks to the windrose, the greater long-term planning, and the constant threat to get your cards in play, but unlike most Feld games, the different ways you get points in CoB are much better integrated. I can see how the different boards and different subset of the tiles drawn each game should lead to greater replay value (it does seem that the boards with 6-8 tile regions are stronger than those that don't have any regions bigger than 5). I will say it is probably one of the best choices for a relatively deep 2p euro that won't take too much more than an hour.

--Mar2012-- Another one of those "do something strategic with dice" games.  It leaps into a space where I rather enjoy (and, for the moment at least, prefer) [thing=73439][/thing] and [thing=55670][/thing], and find [thing=40760][/thing] passable.  None of the four are exceptionally thematic.  But they're cool enough to demand at least the occasional play.

 One of the most balanced games I have ever played and scales greatly with all player's count. Great to play with unexperienced players. One big plus is it's price (but the production is really bad imo). Too dry for my taste but I see myself comeback often due to solid gameplay .

Combo-y goodness wrapped in a super dry theme. Love the thinking involved in trying to set up that perfect, big, point-scoring turn. Feels like an abstract sometimes. The game really breezes along. It can almost feel a little too well-oiled at times, but still a ton of fun.

Very cleverly designed. It's a dice management game where every action during your Turn relies on your dice rolls. However, it's not the traditional old trash where one always wins by rolling 6s. The dice result only governs the target of your action, but doesn't represent a certain power or strength. You still need to brainstorm yourself in order to find a possible winning strategy.

This is a beast of Mr Feld. It doesn't rank higher because of the ugliness of the graphic design/illustrations. If you want a good classic modern euro game, and don't mind abysmal art + a theme that doesn't really makes sense, get this one. You won't regret it.

This game is not likely to impress with its theme or appearance, but is able to stand tall based on its strong and inviting dice-placement mechanics.  It's a satisfying game to play, and engaging enough that you'll be watching your opponents closely, despite that it looks at a glance like a sort of multiplayer-solitaire game.  There is a lot of depth here, yet I think it is almost as approachable as the typical gateway games.

Many ways and strategies to win this good game. Feld at its best: again perfect mechanics that don't let the players wait, but make it possible to plan their next moves.
However not very thematic … where are the castles? Not really these few tiles?

EDIT: rating went down from 8.0 to 7.2

The dice in this game limit your available actions enough to keep things from being too overwhelming or puzzle-like, and yet there are still tons of things to do and consider on your turn. The fact that you can invest in the ability to augment dice results makes things even more nuanced.

Dice action selection and personal kingdom building both appeal to me, but it is very very dry.  I quite enjoyed the mechanisms and yet don't feel compelled to play it again any time soon, which is strange.  That sums up a lot of Felds for me: mechanically interesting, but not addictive.  I'd still try any of his games if you suggested them though.  I think he's a great designer (at least for these light/medium games...haven't tried the heavier fare).

Edit: Revised down. Tried to play a game after a couple of years. Every 6 seconds people were asking "what does this tile do?" "how many points do I get for this?" Then I have to look it up in the rules (which are some of the worst I have ever read. It would be better with more plays, but I don't intend to ever play again. Way too fiddly. No theme. Every player doing their own thing.

Not as good as I hoped. Feels almost like working a puzzle than playing a game. Lots of little pieces and little decisions.

I thought I knew what the awfulness of point salad was. I was soooo wrong! So ridiculously granular that all theme is stripped from play within seconds. You're making points in order to make points, to (wait for it) make more points! (all of which will give you extra points). Imagine counting to 200 in groups of 1-3. Gratuitous point adding! One point for me for figuring this out! Plus one more point for each word of this write-up, plus an additional half-point for ever word with an 'e' in it! GO to it, point adders, add those points! Let's see, that equals roughly...no thank you (+) who the f%^& cares.

Makes gameplaying altogether seem so tedious, so small.

RATING: 8.5
Castles of Burgundy was my first Feld game, and it still is the game he designed (among those in my collection, clearly) I enjoy the most. It's incredibly heterogeneous even if the strategy for winning is more or less always the same: complete the smallest areas first to capitalize the bonus points / round; try to choose carefully the knowledge tiles to maximize the points in the end; focus on mines and castles as soon as possible since these tiles give you extra actions or extra money to get the most powerful black tiles. Still, there are so many varying factors that we still have to play twice the same game; not to mention that during the years Stefan designed many and different boards so that replayability is really granted.

Finally, even if the game implements dice, the incidence of luck factor is not particularly high: there's always something you can do with dice, also thanks to the clever workers mechanic where, by spending worker tokens, you can "manipulate" the results. Really, a brilliant game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This may be one of my new favorite games.  Others on here have commented that they don't like the way the turns play out but I really like it.  My wife and son fight to be first but I am willing to sit back and work the strategy from last place each round.  It normally works out alright for me.  I would rate it even higher but the time to play is longer than I would prefer.  I keep thinking that we will get faster as we get used to the gameplay but so far we haven't played it enough to cross that threshold.

"Die Burgen von Burgund" ist ein Eurogame in Reinformat: wenig Thema, dafür aber durchdachte Spielmechanik. Auch nach fünf Partien hat sich der "Ich will gleich nochmal"-Effekt noch nicht gelegt. Vor allem die unterschiedlichen Spielertableaus (plus Nachschub aus der "spielbox") sorgen für abwechslungsreiche Partien. Funktioniert außerdem zu zweit, dritt und viert gleich gut.

Even Knizia would be ashamed to make such a dry game. I also don't like dice manipulation mechanic and scoring points for every move. There are lots of paths to victory, but they boil down to collecting different types of tiles and the choice is made arbitrarily, as which will turn out better depends on the randomness of the draw and can't be predicted. Will not play again.

I'm sure I'll get to play this more in the years to come, as it seems assured of classic status. I find the small pieces and colour choices a bit of an annoyance. The old 'multi-player solitaire criticism' applies well here - but that is often exactly the kind of game I want to play. Although they've had a real renaissance in the last few years, Feld deserves kudos for his continued use of the humble dice. Certainly they should ensure continued replayability with this delicious vp-cruncher game.

RATING: 7
Playing this game I feel like I've been assaulted by an army of icons. Before you can begin to play the game part of the game and enjoy the game part of the game you'll have to conquer the mountain of different cardboard chits with their special little meanings. Okay... once you get past all that (it's not so difficult), you've got a decent little dice game that plays well 2-3 and with 4 if you don't mind the downtime.

With 101 different ways of scoring points it could almost pass as a Ystari game, but Alea can be happy to have this in their catalogue too. Mainly you'll be racing your opponents to certain tiles and to close off certain areas. With 25 turns you can't do it all, so you'll have to determine what will work best in what combination.

It's very low on the interaction (just a little bit of tile acquiring before your opponents), and it ticks along in a flurry of point grabbing here and there. So much here and there that it's super easy to rush your scoring and overlook grabbing points you're entitled to.

Mechanics match the theme in no way shape or form. You're rolling two dice representing workers? Geographical influence? They let you buy or build or sell stuff. If you've got nothing decent then you can add a couple of worker influence tiles.

Replayability comes from knowledge tiles coming out differently game to game, different player boards and opponents playing in different ways. You can choose to do your own thing, or try and block your opponents from getting choice useful tiles. Ideally you'll be doing both.

If you like to roll a few dice and not have them mean too much, then you might like this little race puzzle. It'll get a play under your belt where it might seem like just another soulless Euro, (it certainly felt that way to me first time around), and it is, but there's some good decisions to be made and it's nice to see dice making a Euro gaming comeback. Feld's Macao did a nice job of using them and this one is a similar weight to that. Quite decent.

Yet again the typical Euro of getting something to take another that improves your position, or to obtain victory points. Nevertheless, the dice and the spacial elements make it a little different. Players actions depends on the roll of two dice, and mostly they consist in take tiles from the center of the table, put the tiles into the private boards or sell commodities. The objective is to develop a region and its different kinds of territory: country, urban, coastal, special places and quarries. Every board has its own strategy, and the players interaction is guaranteed because of the fight for the different tiles and the race for the bonuses.

Another good game from Stephan Feld. Players try to fill up their board with buildings. A random element and some competition for tiles on the game board means your plans have to be flexible. The only problem with this game is artwork. The colors are a little too close to one another, kind of a Tuscan villa smeared about. And the buildings are not very distinctive from one another. Further, the symbols used in this game could be better. If they second edition this game, I might pick it up. Until then I'll play other people's copies.

I really like the way that the draft works, and how you have to use dice to get what you need. The different scoring methods seem well balanced and interesting. The dice place enough constraints on you that you'll need to adjust a bit based on the dice rolls, but are not so restrictive that you can't adapt.

------------------

While the dice can't hurt you so badly that you can't accomplish something, they certainly can be the difference between winning and losing, which I find a bit frustrating sometimes.

This game's "weight" is really just in understanding the tiles in terms of what's out there and how they interact. Once you accomplish that, I think this game is fairly mid/low weight. Really smooth mechanics though, and fun puzzles to solve throughout.

Updated note: I've gained a real appreciation of this game over the past few months even without playing it. I've introduced quite a few other "heavier" games to Mel (Keyflower, Agricola, Dungeon Petz, Concordia) and this one really stands above those in terms of its accessibility and its clarity. I've bumped the rating up because of that very important aspect

I like how this game is about optimization.  It presents the optimization puzzle found in a lot of euro games in a very manageable way.  I am also impressed with how easy this game is to play.

This game has a very nice flow of play and delivers the a satisfying feeling of building something.

RATING: 8
A truly enjoyable (and usually quick) tableau builder. I'm a sucker for tableau games - Race for the Galaxy and Glen More are high in my list - and this is among the best.

This game is extremely well-balanced, in that scores will usually be tight (I lost a recent game 233 to 231) despite players using different strategies. (For example, my opponent in that game had no mines, but was able to score small districts very early.) Plays very well with four players and equally well (if not better) with only two. In my opinion, these are remarkable traits for any game to have.

The down side, of course, is not the randomness to me (hearing Tom Lehmann complain about rolling seven doubles in a row and giving up on the game seems a very shallow criticism) but that usually your decisions are very obvious. This is not a difficult game to parse, so players will often pick up the strategy right away on their first game - even somewhat inexperienced gamers. As a result, I think many dedicated gamers will bore of this.

This isn't much of a criticism, though. To me, this is a fantastic Settlers replacement and gateway game. I have seen many Ticket to Ride level players really become addicted to this game and I'm super-happy to see them latch on to this - a gateway into Stefan Feld's world, what more could we ask for?

That said, I think the goal for a heavy gamer should be to figure out a way to fill their entire tableau. Can it be done??

Die Burgen von Burgund (German name sounds cooler -- like Burger on Burger) ropes together a lot of fundamental ideas from other Eurogames, and glues it all together with the action dice. You need a die to swipe a tile, and another die to place it in your tableau.

Any time you use dice as actions, there's always the 2 extreme risks: it is too luck-dependent versus does it not even matter what I roll since everything is good -> I just follow what the die tells me to do and take it like a bitch. This game falls more into the latter category, but the decisions involved are interesting enough to make it a non-issue.

My only complaint is that the game is a little too long for what it is. Game length has to be justified by a linear/exponential increase in interesting situations and options. Die Burgen von Burgund doesn't really get any more interesting the further along in the game you are (it's less an upside-down pyramid, more a building that tapers off at the bottom), and it can get repetitious. Trimming the # of rounds and the size of the player boards would have worked better.

==================

Aw what a dumbass I was. There is no payoff, just a gimmick that's cute for the first 30 minutes, like every single Feld game ever designed. As I suspected, the game didn't get any more interesting, but it was a lifetime thing, not a once-in-a-game thing (i.e. the first 30 minutes were interesting, but on the basis of your experience with the game, not the first 30 minutes of each play). Bone-dry game. And though you ostensibly should follow what your dice tell you, the strategy is to always have flexibility with the dice to prepare for a rainy day, which means it's almost pointless to screw others, since they can always climb out of that hole.

Hot tip: be aware of any game where it's possible to score 200+ VPs. It means the designer just let himself go, and gives you a carrot for doing anything from sitting down to play a game to doing an action. The OVER-JUSTIFICATION EFFECT in full force. VPs should only be awarded for POWER-MOVES, not for scratching your ass.

My wife and really like this game. This is defintely a new type of dice game - I haven't seen anything as interesting since Yspahan.  I've played 3 two player games and one four player game. It's a little long as a 4 player game the first time around.  Makes a great 2 player game. Each game plays out very differently depending on what pieces come up when and which board you use/get. There are also many paths to victory.  I look forward to many more plays.

Did you ever prepare to play a game that you just know you are going to love?  DBvB is that game for me.  Feld is just a master at scratching my gaming itch, which is why I generally buy whatever he puts out.  Aside from the oddly-themed Luna, I can't think of a game of his that I would hesitate to play.

Die Burgen has dice manipulation and just like I love it in Troyes, I love it here as well.  It's another game that scales down to two very easily.  If you love Feld's designs, then I would feel pretty safe in recommending this game as a blind buy, because I know you'll love this as well.

Playing this on Yucata has given me even a greater appreciation for this one.  It's great!

Just a few plays in and I am already second-guessing my strategies... lots of choices and fun combos make for a challenging, light-medium strategy game.

Highly recommend!

Update: This is quickly becoming my significant other's favourite game (not to mention the highest in complexity of the games that she enjoys). Just an excellent way for us to spend 40 minutes together, giving the grey matter a little workout.

FWIW, I have not tried with more than two players (I have no particular desire to either)

Another of our favorite games by Stefan Feld.  We enjoy mixing up our strategies in this game.  Sometimes I might go strong into the animals, sometimes more for knowledge tiles, sometimes buildings etc.  There always seems to be a rush for the castles and ships in our games, but other than that the rest of the game seems to vary a bit for us.  Its fun to see what tiles will come out where and we usually adapt from that.  This is a must-have!  Another game proving why Feld is probably our favorite designer.

RATING: 1
Hi! This is my original comment:[hr]Complex, painless, themeless. 

The games I don't get intrigue me, they are elusive, they involve people in such a way that produces unpredictable outcomes (emergant). This is not such a game. There is no theme worth naming such, there is no interaction - you're just staring at your own board (okay, yes, there's [i]rich interaction[/i] which involves grabbing a tile from the market before someone else does). 

What this is: a spatial puzzle you must solve by managing random elements and special powers of some tiles. That's all of it. And it manifests as a victory point salad, which seems to me like laziness on designer's part. Or it's just another step from conflict into the friendly euro zone when you get instant gratification for nothing. 

It's a sissy game. 
Which means it tries very hard to hide the fact that it is indeed a game. 

And I realised I was giving some colder Uwe Rosenberg's design hard time unjustifiably. Uwe's game have focus and even in their prussian coldness, they're charming in that old german way. This has no focus (victory point salad) and no charm either. It's that aunt that let you eat everything you wanted and you didn't end up any better for it. [hr]Later comment:

Back in the day people were talking about euros again and some guy called Feld and something called "a victory point salad". Of course, me being clever, I was sure what they're talking about. Then I played Burgund von Burgund and ... [i]Oh![/i] A realization dawned. So that's a victory point salad! It's not about points at all, I mean, yes it's about points from everywhere, but it's not the points that matter (they're everywhere!), but the dilution of tension. I couldn't have imagined that even the tiny amount of tension and interaction in workerplacements could be diluted further. But hey, if anybody could do it, Feld's your man. (He's also the man to make an auction be about optimisation, but that's another game). [hr][b]But what you really want to read is this: [listitem=3781054][/listitem][/b]

Yes, there are dice and luck but you have the opportunity to minimize that luck and go where you want. Of course, you won't stand in front of an opponent who has total good luck through the game but you're not totally stuck.

Awesome game, seems a little overwhelming at first glance but rather simple after your 2nd second game. Every single game that you play will be different so your constantly adjusting your strategy. The game comes with a lot of playing boards so even the map that you play on will consistently be different. I recommend to anyone that like variety and simple but deep strategy game.

JUEGAZO en mayúsculas. Stefan Feld está muy de moda, y yo solo había probado el Roma (que por cierto, me gusta mucho) y me animé a comprar este, aunque no me convencía al leerme las reglas.
En poquitos meses le hemos jugado un montón de partida. Es un vicio.
Reglas super sencillas, pero teniendo que tomar muchas decisiones, solo con dos acciones por turno (con dos dados). Tiene una mecánica excelente.

Played once with 2P and another time with 3P, with a 2 year gap between games. In Castles of Burgundy, players compete to fill their estates with various landscapes, and earn points when they cover regions, ship goods etc. All actions are determined by the 2 dice each player rolls at the beginning of every round, which makes Castles of Burgundy a combination of both strategy and tactics.

The first thing I noticed about the gameplay is that it's surprisingly concise and straightforward for a Feld game. As the landscape grows and players begin collecting more knowledge tiles, the scope of choices also gradually expands and strategies begin to solidify. Unfortunately this also leads to some considerable downtime as players agonise over their optimal move for the turn.

On the whole I quite like Castles of Burgundy. The core mechanism isn't quite as attractive as that of Macao's or Trajan's, and the range of choices can be daunting as the game progresses, but I appreciate the tightness and relative simplicity of the gameplay here.

Burgundy, my Burgundy. I enjoyed this game the few times I played in real life. Then, I started playing on Yucata and played it one hundred more times. Did I tire of it? NO. Cause it's freaking amazing. It offers a lot of variability with the timing of when tiles become available and the different player boards. It's typical point salad Feld where you can take your pick of multiple paths to victory as everything you do nets you some amount of victory points. Delicious! I love lots of victory points!! My appreciation for the brilliance of this game has just grown so much over the past year. A true gem! I'm playing a game on Yucata as I type this because that's how I roll!!

My perfect 10 game. If you're into light to mid-weight Euro games, this is the game for you. Sure the components are sub-par but that allows this game to be affordable to the public (under $30). I highly recommend that you play this with 2 players only. Avoid playing at 4 if possible. Its very simple, you roll two dice on your turn and depending on the number you could either grab tiles and/or place tiles corresponding to the pips. Every turn is a rewarding turn and because of the game's design you can pull off a long chain of combinations that'll reward you tons of points!

Absolutely great game!! I love the way Feld found a way to reward players instead of punish them. Another big plus for me is the sim-estate feel, building little castles and towns and figuring out ways to be more efficient, so cool! For a Euro, everything is pretty damn thematically solid except for the one thing where we were wondering what the hell is physically on a yellow tile. It feels like you have a specialist living on your estate, who is a farming expert, or a town planner, etc. This would've been a golden opportunity to add that little flavor kick, but this is just personal preference really, and not a criticism. I have to say, I admire and like his other games, but man, this one is really genius.

Have several plays on Yucata, and quite like the gameplay.

BUT... Way too fiddly and icon dependant for me to ever consider buying this. Everytime I play this online, I have to have the rulebook open as well to help go through all the bonuses each knowledge and building tile will give you. I can see this in a 'live' game really slowing up turns as you try and analyse every conceivable move to optimise VPs.

Thus on BGG rating scaale, it's no more than a 6.

Picked up on sale for Thanksgiving since I thought my Mom might like it (she is a big computer game Civ player but not a board gamer). I started the long weekend off by introducing her to Friday so she could get the idea of building combos and such. After the big day I pulled out The Castles of Burgundy and we learned it together. We ended up playing 7 games in 3 days...

I've only played a two-player game, but it's very dry.  I don't get the hype.  Like Terra Mystic the hex map annoys me, but that might just be the graphic design.  The buildings generally look the same to me.  Some scoring strategies and thematic design don't really make sense to me.  It sounds like three-players might be the best option, if everyone enjoys the game.  I think Macao and Roma were much better Feld games.

My most played and favorite eurogame. I love the wealth of choices you have in each turn, but also how clear those choices are and how simply and elegantly everything sort of meshes together into a coherent flow. It's marvelously well-balanced, and it's relaxing to play. The only tension comes at the end of the game, when you're tallying up you final points to see who squeaked out a victory. The pay-off from combos is great, and I love trying to beat my high scores.

Notre Dame, Macao, In the Year of the Dragon és most itt a Burgund Stefan Feldtől. Lehet, hogy Stefan Feld rajongó leszek? Fantasztikus játékok, a Burgund pedig hozza az előzőek színvonalát. Kockadobálás, szerencse? Közel sem! Nem is éreztem a játék során, hogy óriási gondban lennék a kidobott értékek miatt. Eleve a kompenzáló munkáslapkák könnyen szerezhetőek, bőven van lehetőség különböző akciókra, így tényleg nem szerencsejáték, de mégis meghatároz egy lehetséges kört, amiből a játékosnak a két akcióját fel kell építenie és a legtöbbet kihoznia belőlük. Mindenki a saját birtokát építi, városokat, legelőket, várakat, bányákat húz fel, hajókat indít árukért. Sok lehetőség, egyáltalán nem nehéz szabály és játékmenet. Nem éreztem lassúnak, szerintem négy játékossal sem nő meg jelentősen az üresjáratok ideje. 2 játékossal pedig tökéletes élvezetet nyújtott. Stefan Feld csak így tovább!

[2011-05-28]
Hihetetlen, de 3 játékossal is két-két pont különbség lett a végeredmény. Nagyon kiegyenlített játéknak tűnik és úgy érzem nagyon magas az újrajátszhatósági faktora, főként a különböző kezdőtérképek miatt is. Talán egyedüli negatívuma lehet, hogy négyen kicsit sokat kell várni esetleg mire újra sorra kerül a játékos, de majd erről később nyilatkozom.

[2013-04-15]
Négyen nem biztos, hogy ajánlott játszani. Hárman is rendesen hosszúra nyúlhat. Az újrajátszhatóság a többféle térkép miatt valóban magas, de azért vannak benne logikus és újrajátszható stratégiák.

RATING: 8
I've wondered... what is it that makes The Castles of Burgundy special? As much as I like this game, in my mind there's no doubt that there are many Feld games that are superior. Despite that, CoB continues to be his highest ranked game on BGG by far.

I think the reason might be accessibility. There are few games that are as easy to learn while providing this level of strategic depth (can't find any in the top 20). Once you start rolling those dice and working out how to grow your estate... there's no stopping anymore.

Play it!

[i]Too Long, Kinda Boring[/i]

My first play of this was good, however my tolerance for a game of this type at this length isn't as high since in the same time block I could play something I like a lot more. Simply trying to optimize your score on a round-by-round basis for this stretch of time just isn't an engaging game to me.

Played with 4 players, 2 new, and it took about 3 hours... enough time to finish something more rewarding

So this ends up like Ora Et Labora for me -- just too much of something that isn't my cup of tea. I prefer my games like this to be shorter, which I'm sure it is with less players or experience -- but even the advertised 1.5 or 2 hours would be too much.

Finally got to play this and it was better than I was expecting. For some reason I thought it was going to be dry and complicated (*cough* Stefan Feld *cough*) but it's actually pretty quick and easy to play. Easily the most accessible Feld game I've played to date. Trying to optimize your turns is fun and interesting and sometimes your plans don't work out and you need to adapt but it's never super frustrating. If it wasn't a drab-looking generic Euro game theme I'd rate this even higher (it's a hard sell to people who think it looks dry and dull but I think this would appear to a lot of people who probably don't even give it a chance based on the box/compoments).

What a surprise -- another great Feld game.  This might be one of my top heavier games that I've played in the past few years.

Oh wow. This is truly one of my favorites of all time. It feels so good when you're playing, building your little... what is it supposed to be? A town, or city or something? Whatever, who cares? it's not the most thematic game out there, but it is sooooo good. Great combos to discover, no harsh upkeep mechanic or punishments (unlike in Macao, for instance - from the same designer), another fantastic and clever dice mechanic, no dumb "take that" thrown in just to make it more "interactive". Really, i can go on and on, but suffice to say that Mr Feld is certainly one of my favorite designers, if not my favorite - and his stuff just gets better and better. If you like low interaction, deep euros, and you dont mind some cool dice stuff thrown in, you will love this game. The bits are nothing to rave about, and the color choices are pretty but,...well...stupid. Nevertheless, the game is a masterwork.

Clever dice rolling, action selection game. I do enjoy the tile-placement mechanic and the race to close out areas of your tableau, as well as trying to make the most of what you've rolled. Seems a little overrated here, but still a good game.

UPDATE: I think it's a little high, although I do enjoy the rolling mechanic and trying to fill my board. Turn order is important as is making effective selections with your tiles. Overall, I really enjoy the game.

UPDATE #2: This is a good rating for this; I really do enjoy it.

UPDATE #3: Excellent, excellent game. The game is just the total package - nice tension in obtaining the tiles and also in completing and using them. Worthy of being in the top 10.

RATING: 5.5
Most overrated game in the top 100, for me, without a doubt.  I had such high hopes, since I love Macao and Bruges.  Really makes me wonder about the ratings on BGG.  The gameplay is rinse and repeat, for 5 rounds, with no arc, or build up.  Feels about one round too long as well.  Way too hard to not mess up the scoring at least once per game, by not remembering to take these two points or those two points, or wait, I have this tile that says I can get this, or do that.  Did I take that last round?  I don't remember.  Then the game ends 173 to 172, and you wonder.  But that's not even the biggest problem.  The biggest problem is the variety of different boards.  
Someone on BGG, did a statistical study of all the different boards, and found the average scores for a 2 player game, to be as high as an 18 point variance.  So with some boards being 6 points better and some boards being 10 points better, do two equally skilled players, play with a handicap then?  When I play with the board that is 4 points better on average, and I win by 3 points, should I feel smart?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Decent euro with mildly interesting decisions--and tons of tactical depth thanks to the dice-allocation mechanism. Indirectly interactive and plays as well or better with fewer players. The artwork is bland and the theme is nonsensical, yet they're both functional. Mechanically, it's rather unique. On the one hand, it's not a bad action optimization game. On the other, it's dry, repetitive, mechanical, anticlimactic, and the individual player boards are symptomatic of how little interaction there is. In other words, it's a typical Feld. Like so many Felds, I suspect that this one would play as well solo as it does with others. 

To be fair, the dice ensure a measure of dynamism, but overall the game just isn't very compelling. This isn't sour grapes, either. I'm good at the game. But what does that mean exactly? I'm good at tactically optimizing points for the sake of scoring points? Optimization is a skill, but it's not why I play games. There's no narrative arc here, and there are few opportunities for meaningful interaction.

SO chomping at the bit to play this. I've become an unabashed Feld fan.

Update: Superb. Good playing time. Rating will probably go up from here after more plays.

Update: After more plays, I'm a bit put off by the game. There are many things I like, but I sometimes feel luck is far too prominent in the design. It can just be crushing and there's nothing you can do about it.

So when you hear the term "Multiplayer solitaire" bandied about for games like Roll for the Galaxy, this is another that could largely fit in that description. Aside from the whole tile drafting getting in other people's way aspect of the game, you're largely left to your own devices.

My wife and I like this game; you've got your 50 actions, plus the possibility of a few extras, and you have to develop your castle grounds as effectively as you can. We reach the end of this and immediately want to play again to try and do better. Good fun for those who like solid dice-rolling tile drafting games.

RATING: 7.5
This is a pretty fun game! I just wish the production quality were better: the player boards are flimsy, the tiles are on the thin side, and the colors are just terrible and washed-out looking (and the yellow on the board doesn't even match the yellow on the tiles)! Also, gameplay seems ideally suited for the full complement of 4: with fewer, you won't see all the tiles and it seems you could just luck into a very good (or bad) situation when that last turn comes around. Still, I wouldn't mind having a copy of this cool game.

--- Summary ---
Players start with a random set of two (or 3?) goods on their play mats. Also, a number of worker tiles (= position in turn order), which allow you to modify die rolls +/- 1.

The board shows 6 numbered areas each with space for several tiles (a new set is placed each round, some specified but most random; will see all tiles in 4er game by the last round); an area in the center (for the black-backed tiles); and spaces for goods tiles. The non-goods tiles are one of several types (beige buildings of different types, each of which gives you a different reward when built; green cities, which immediately give you another virtual wild die; yellow tiles, mostly for end-game VP bonuses or in-game rule modifiers; blue boats, which advance you on the turn track -- Macao style -- and also allow you to take one group of goods tiles from the board; gray mines, which each give you 1 income; green pastures, with 1 of 4 animal types, which gives VP when played). There are 5 rounds, each with 5 turns. Each round, place 5 goods spaces randomly on the board in designated areas.

At the start of each turn, one of those goods is placed in an area corresponding to one of the 6 numbered areas. Players collect their income (based on number of mines), then simultaneously roll their 2d6; 1st player rolls an extra die, to determine which space to place the goods tile for this turn. Then, in turn order, take your actions by spending your d6 (will be using the numbers rolled):
- take a tile from the same-numbered area on the board; place in your staging area (space for 3 tiles)
- place a tile you've previously taken (now in your staging area) onto a matching numbered space of your player board; must be adjacent to another tile, and same building may not be built twice in the same area. Some tiles may award immediate VP. If you completely filled an area, earn VP (more for larger area and earlier in game); if you were the 1st or 2nd player to do so for that area type, take the corresponding bonus VP tile (to be scored at end of game).
- sell all goods of matching number: earn 1 gold + n VP per tile sold
- take 2 worker tiles
- in addition to dice actions, may spend 2 gold to buy one of the black-backed tiles in the center of the board

After 5 turns, the round ends: remove all tiles on the board from the game; refill with new tiles from supply (will see all tiles by the end of the game if playing 4-player). After 5 rounds, award end-game VP:
- based on yellow bonus tiles (e.g., for each building of a specific type; for each color of goods sold during game; etc.)
- bonus tiles for having completed areas on player boards
- 1VP per unsold good
- 1VP per 2 workers
- 1VP per gold
Most VP wins!

Very cool Euro.  I never played a Feld design until a couple months ago and since then I've played 3 (In the Year of the Dragon, Macao, and this one) and they've all been winners, including this one.

This one is a small departure in concept from my other Feld experiences in that this game is a lot more forgiving and leisurely.  The other two Feld games I've played were very harsh, punching you in the face and making you pay heavily for your mistakes.  When I realized this I was a little afraid I wouldn't enjoy this game.  I actually tend to like punishing games, the tension gets my adrenaline pumping and has me excited and on the edge of my seat.  This design, while still providing opportunities to directly compete, mostly had people doing their own things and I also tend not to like mostly solitaire experiences.

What this game has in spades though is charm.  I love rolling dice when the mechanics are expertly designed like this game.  The dice results determine the actions you are able to take but these really just present a rough guideline on what you are able to do.  The resource to increase or decrease your die results is abundant and easy to acquire so the dice end up just directing you into the easiest and most efficient moves out of a couple options.

These actions are some combination of putting different items onto your estate and/or shipping goods for gold and victory points.  In the end that makes this a very standard Euro.  Your goal is to have the most VPs at the end of the game and so the goal of your actions should be to create the most efficient VP engine.  To go along with the friendly tone of the game are beautiful soft colors and tiles depicting happy animals grazing and oil-painted Victorian buildings.  The only real opportunity for player interaction is acquiring tiles your opponents are after, especially the rarer ones.

There are certainly people out there that prefer more forgiving and leisurely-paced games with an inviting coat of paint and this is the perfect Euro for those people (most Eurogames don't tend to fit that bill).  It is so charming even I greatly enjoyed it and would probably never turn down a gentlemanly game.

Dice are cool these days. Feld provided us with another (Macao) dice game but this time with a more reasonable result. It's not that Macao isn't well done but it's in my opinion clumsy. Burgund is much more elegant in the use of dice.
It's a game with no theme at all. Players do things to collect points and gain advantages as in most euros with no point other than that. I like the concept of the game but I find it boring and not very interesting. I've only played with 2 players and it took about 90 to 120 minutes to play and that's the time I take to play Brass!

Not my cup of tea. This year, Mr. Feld provided us Luna a much better game IMO.

A new favorite has arrived! Quite enjoy this Euro, it pushed many good buttons with me and is highly addictive, I had no idea. The mix of lucky dice roll and smart choices (which tile to take, where to place it,...) is very well executed, good Euros (for me) have a certain luck element to make it more accessible and less projectible and the balance here is perfect. 
It is now on yucata where you can choose from all the available player boards which is quite nice I must admit, I did spend some time playing it there.

Ticks all the boxes for a game that Liz will love, and she does (despite getting frustrated from time to time). It just works, and even with dice, the mitigation of your rolls is really interesting, trying to chain actions etc.

Scoring is very to-fro, so some mad swings and very exciting games, and the variety in the maps keeps it interesting.

From a rules read through this looks like it has some similarities with Macao - dice, and instead of lots of  card powers this has lots of tile powers. Its also a very flimsy theme - to the extent that it seems a shame that Alea did not try and find something that suited rather than more fragging castle building in the fragging middle ages - a space theme could have worked v well here.

Gripe over. The game looks fascinating, though how interaction works worries me, as players have their own boards and there appears a lot of Macao like opportunities for mini combos and specialisation

English rules in the box - what a good idea to cut out the middle man!

Graphic design terrible, This game is really too 'big' for the alea format. It needed a bigger box. bigger, tiles and better colouring and design. a triumph of 'beige over function'

Think i preferred 3 player to four.

After 4th game i have really gone off 'Die Burgen' - in latest game 3 of us were sperated by 4 points having totalled well over 200. winning or losing seemed meaningless in the context of the score as none of us could identify why player had performed better than another, Moreover, there is no real strategic arc to the game - it just feels like rinse and repeat in most of the 25 turns. Player interaction is really limited to turn order and grabbing a tile before someone else (possibly nabbing a needed animal in 2 player)- otherwise its a real shared solitaire exercise, in fact the game would probably work well as a solitaire. The game feels far too long for what it is. There are lots of clever little combos which are nice to pull off, however they are done in isolation.Add in the terrible graphic design and its now sold

I will admit I was expecting some sort of punishment that is all too commonly found in Feld's games.  I really enjoy this game as it does dice placement in a much better way than others like Kingsburg.  Your dice rolls are overall fairly easy to manipulate so there is always something productive you can do on your turn.  Only two actions per turn makes the game move along at a nice pace too.  Highly recommend.

First impression: dry and woefully unexciting. It has a learning curve and the rule book keeps it's secrets well. People trying to explain the game kept invoking Macao and lamenting that the play guides from BGG were not present. 

Later impression: I guess it just took a few plays to appreciate. Like Yspahan, Burgundy has a solid dice mechanism to determine turn options. Everyone fills in their own board, but there is real competition for resources. Keeping track of the special buildings is key to this game, but thankfully there aren't so many as to be overwhelming.

Many nice small decisions how to get the most out of your dice throws. A bit repetetive and hardly any interaction. Best with 2, okay with 3 players, too slow with 4 players for me (more players only mean more downtime and less control). Bellow average components and graphics.

Currently my favourite game. Went and bought Trajan and Notre Dame on the strength of this designers rising reputation. 
Another nice couples game although fairly simple I wouldn't quite say its a gateway but rather a second step for gateway gamers. I found this easy to teach to the wife as there is no hidden information. Maybe a bit too long for 4 players but it's capable of handling that amount.

RATING: 8.5
UPDATE:
Down from a 9 to an 8.5.
Played again this weekend and I think the game is just too tactical for it to be rated any higher. There really isn't any longterm planning that can be done. At the most, you can plan phase by phase, but really it's all based on which tiles are available when it's your turn and which numbers you rolled. That being said, the fun factor hasn't diminished at all.


Original Review:
I should probably rate this game an '8' if I'm being completely accurate, but just because of the pure enjoyment I get from this game, I'm bumping it up to a 9.

The rulebook and initial learning period is a bit unintuitive, but once you "get it," it's super easy to understand.

I like that there are a lot of strategic options, but your actions on a turn-by-turn basis are limited so you don't get too tired out from overthinking. Yes, there is some randomness, but you never feel like the game is what beats you. 

If it weren't for the terrible components and blank artwork (seriously, everything looks beige), it would be bumped up to a 9.5. Deluxe edition please.

Surprisingly accessible game, open enough to allow everyone to pursue their own strategy with a positive vibe to it. Popular with the whole family. The production values are not up to today's standards and whilst this helps keep the game price low, there is definitely room for a collector's edition - think Small World Designer Edition.

RATING: 5
Mechanically sound if you like this type of game. This is not my type of game. Need to give it another try though.

There are too many ways to get points. Nearly everything you do gives you points. This makes me feel like I had little to do with the outcome. Everyone optimized the best they could so it was happenstance that things ended the way they did. I did not feel I played any better or worse than the other more experienced players. A close score around nearly 200 points validates that to me.

There are lots of choices to make but there isn't much meaning to them in the long run as you will get points from any direction you go. The choices are a kind of red herring as you are really just sifting through them trying to find the most efficient each turn. Many choices you might make for planning ahead are leaps of faith as the future resources are random. I've heard that this goes away at max players because all the tiles will be used.

Dice are used to limit your choices and actions but these are easily modified. You can still have turns where you simply didn't get as optimum a roll as others. While I'm fine with that in many other games, The amount of points from so many actions means the loss of 2 points from things outside your control is more detrimental than 2 points gained from a choice you made.

The first turn dice results and player order will determine your starting direction but this again becomes meaningless as you may not get what you need to work that direction and points can come from many other directions as well.

The tiles that provide bonus points will give you direction early on but you may not see many of the tiles that go with it for those bonus points. Like wise, later bonus tiles may only be good for one player because they already have many of the related tiles to benefit from the tile. 

There is little to no player interaction. Taking tiles you don't need to hurt a leader also hurts you.

Player order can have a large effect on the outcome of turns but you can affect player order.

The game is boring as hell to look at. The colors and art work are dull and muted. Theme is barley there.

Sigh. Yet another game by Stefan Feld involving some interesting mechanisms, but unfortunately buried in several layers of gratuitous ways of scoring points. I wish he would stop doing that.

In the end, this is yet another soulless victory point optimising exercise devoid of any meaningful theme, hardly worthy of the term 'game'. Baffling enough, this seems the most popular type of eurogame these days.

I give it a 6 because I enjoyed trying to solve the puzzle once. I'm utterly indifferent towards the game having played it once.

A competitive game with a little "take that" with tile choosing.  Very balanced, and works well with all numbers of players.  There are lots of symbols though, so that is a turn-off for less experienced players.  This game is also somewhat subject to players staring at their own mats, and it very much feels like you're all playing your own mini-game separately together.

A very clever strategy game of building your own duchy.  Select actions, new territories, or placement of those territories based on die rolls.

RATING: 7.5
A good game of engine building and special powers.  It does however run quite long to play well.  It is no where near 90 minutes unless you play it a ridiculous non-planning-pace. To be honest we've only see our play times increase since you are able to increase your downstream planning when you have more knowledge of the interactions possible.  Its primary problem is that to play well, you MUST take time on your turn to analyze the board situation--most of that CANNOT be done during the other players' turns since the board situation changes substantially with each player.

It is very good, but is it worth the time to play?  That is a question that can only be determined by how much we end up bringing it to the table.

It has similarities,not just in mechanics, but it over all feel to several other games.  It's closest to Glenn More which plays in about an hour, compared to 2.5 to 3 hours for 4 players.  It also has a bit of a feel of an expanded Agricola, which is pretty cool since one of the things I don't particularly like is how confined the options are in Agricola.  Diamonds Club hits all the same points in a much more streamlined fashion, but it is lighter fare--so if you're looking for something with a nice developmental arc with lots of interaction, CoB is a go-to.

Is has a heck of a set up and take down time, but the game length offsets that--at least the game is long enough that you don't feel like the set up is unreasonable in relation.  But is it worth the 3 hours to play it well...maybe--but consider that some of the 18xx games like 1889, are leagues better and take about the same amount of time.  Now stylistically they are very different, but these long time slots are pretty precious.

In 1889, because it is a zero luck game, and allows significant downstream planning, you are in control of your game.  In CoB, your decisions are primarily tactical, and it is possible to lose simply to luck.  Is 3 hours of gameplay where you can win or lose based on luck a good deal?  Well, it's a pretty fun ride, but the game is definitely hovering on the edge of being traded away

Very good dice allocation game. It has the usual issues that the wrong dice and the wrong time [i]can[/i] screw you, but it's one of those designs where your choices usually run the gamut from the good to the great, so "cutthroat" play is the equivalent of taking the last macaroon from the dessert tray. "That villain Mr. Bingley has taken the last macaroon -- should I take an éclair or a profiterole?"

This kind of convivial garden-party atmosphere makes it a pleasant and enjoyable way to spend time. Depending on your proclivity for games that set your heart racing or make you cackle with glee at particularly vicious play, that could be damning with faint praise.

Not recommended with four players; that extra 50% downtime over the three player game is a killer.

Mixed feelings here.  The game is good, and I usually regard it with distaste when people diss a game for going on "too long," but this one did run 3 hours.  I joked when we were done that I'd enjoyed it so much, it only felt like two and a half hours!  I'll have to play it again and see whether a) it runs in under 2 hours or b) it's so much fun that I'm glad it runs 3 hours.  P.S.  Played the second time 3-1/2 years later.  It's still way too long.  Knocking a half point off the rating.

You can play it as a nice-looking, enjoyable tile-placing game with your euro-playing friends or you can view it as a four-player solitaire engine-building game.

Rating based on 4 players.

Typical abstract Euro Game from Stefan Feld: solid design, multifaceted paths of winning, nice indirect player interaction, random elements from dice and tile draws to increase dynamic and replayability.  However, this game is too abstract and mechanic for me.  The rules are too fiddly without handy player aids.  The choice of color, iconography and illustration are so bad - hope that it can be reimplemented with a better theme.  And, with slow players and 4 players, this game would be too long and be boring.  I may give this game a second chance with 2 players - but why would I buy a big box just for 2 players - why not Race for the Galaxy then.

I understand why it is rated well.  But it's not my cup of tea.

Lots of gaming pleasure for your money. I like the flair, the tactical decisions, the look of the components.
However, I am not sure whether there is much more strategy in the game besides getting early Mines and trying to be ahead on the ship track.
Comparing and evaluating the different boards is also interesting. Right now I think that boards with many smaller areas are favoured over those with fewer and bigger areas.

Have played this a few times thus far with my gaming group. I do like the concept and the variety of strategies and options available while overall mechanic still stays fairly straight forward(roll the dice, use numbers on dice to acquire,place a tile,sell goods or get workers)... still need to use a cheat sheet for the yellow tiles. Biggest issue I have is reliance on dice rolling especially if you're not the first person. Yes the workers are there to compensate and if you get a bad roll here and there they work great... I seem to be plagued with entire rounds of bad rolls and at which point the game can become painful. I'm still determined to play it though so overall it is really good!

Brilliant. Typical alea. I want to do this, this & this. Unfortunately, I can only do that. A quick look up. I'd best do that now because it probably won’t be there next turn. Not a cube shuffler (no cubes!).

It’s a tile laying game. You gather tiles, you store them, you place them.

Restrictions & constraints everywhere. Timing matters. Sometimes you want turn-order position, sometimes you want to grab goods. Sometimes you want to complete an area to earn a bonus tile. Cash matters - with cashflow, you could obtain another tile every round. Storage matters: you have a 3-tile store - all tiles have to go through that store before being placed. Workers matter - your two actions per turn are partially dictated by dice. Workers allow you to tweak die values (including 6/1 rollover).

In the first session, we played twice. First with the "beginners #1" boards, then we decided we were pros and went for random boards. [i]Ooof that was harder[/i]. Tightly constrained choices. Much greater need to plan ahead to create flexibility.

No colour issues whatsoever. No "small icons" problems (we printed 3 pages from the rules PDF as a crib sheet, but the buildings page was almost unused in our second game). A great small-footprint game where the combined central board plus four A4 player boards fit conveniently on a table.

Absolutely love this game though have only played once with my daughter and the rest of the time has been on the Boite A Jeaux website. Prefer this game as 2 player only as can see the downtime can be a bit long with 3 or more players and the chance of tiles going before you're turn increases the random nature of the game. But what a great 2 player game and very addictive with trying to get all of those regions completed, making the dice rolls you get as efficient as possible without wasting workers and the added bonus of almost getting points for everything you do, as to be expected in a feld game!

My first (and only Feld).  I really like it.  It is probably my favorite unthematic  game.  What really makes the game work for me is the worker that allows you to alter your die roll.  Without that element, the game would be to random (options limited too die roll) for me.

Pretty cool concept, using the dice is cool where it has some luck involved but minimal and easily mitigated.  As the first player for most of the game was forced into some AP, but for those who went after there was enough time to plan ahead, so the round speeds up as you go along.  Lacks theme entirely, and points everywhere.

Fantastic. While this is a dice game, there are a LOT of ways to use your dice and a great variety of things to build. Plays very fast with experienced players, especially with 2. Warning: First games and teaching are slow (sometimes painfully so) due to the variety of buildings and special tiles.

A very clever dice game with tons and tons of options.  Unfortunately, the huge amounts of options become a bit overwhelming at the end of the game and things slow down quite a bit.

Another winner from Feld, the king of all things Alea.

quite good light strategy euro game German style

Rice-rolling and allocation game with a territory building theme. Each turn players roll two dice, the numbers of which allow certain actions to be taken. There are various tiles depicting different types of land usage and these correspond with one of the numbers on the dice. These tiles can be selected and then placed on the players' 'princedom' boards. To place the tiles within the princedom regions another corresponding dice number has to be obtained. Points are awarded for the first player to complete certain types of regions and having matching types of certain tiles. This is a simple yet clever game and despite the core mechanism being that of dice rolling, luck doesn't seem to play too great a part in the eventual outcomes, which leads to 'TCoB' being another excellent lighter strategy game from designer Stefan Feld.

CoB went over well with my wife because of the theme (it has farm animals) and the MPS build your own little empire aspects without interference. It did seem to run a little long but that's not too surprising for a first game though it does concern me when we play with more than two. For me the game doesn't strike me as particularly interesting BUT it was a pleasant experience and I expect to see more interesting choices in future plays. The art style is pleasant but could have been more evocative and identifiable. The iconography is okay but could have been better. The box insert is useless and the components are a little thin as seems to be Alea's custom.
I can't see this being much fun with 3/4 players. It's pretty dry and slow.

--

I've really soured on this 10 games in. It's only playable as a 2p game and the more I play the more random it feels. Strategic choices are almost impossible due to the random tile draw and tactical combo play gets old fast. The constant counting of points for every little action adds to the dearth of fun to be had.

A fantastically well designed middle weight game with great mechanics that integrate really neatly. This is probably one of my most played games. It's light enough to be interesting and non-intimidating for newer players, but has enough depth and strategy for more experienced gamers. My only caveat is that it is a lot like multiplayer solitaire and once you have once strategy, you tend to stick to it so the replayability might not be optimal.

First Play : Wow, what a score fest.  Points for this, points for that, points for completing this on top of that.

Mechanically it's sound and plays very easy.  There is a lot to explore here.  It's missing a touch of the fun factor.  I like it, though.

Update: this has become a standby game.  The more you play all the icons and whatnot get easier.  This leads to better strategy and better tension.  Fun is creeping in.

Tentative rating of 7.5

Rating raised to 8.5

This is a great 2 player match.  You are always engaged while playing.  It is a score fest and the tension comes from hoping to get that tile you want.  Still, it plays so smoothly and is a nice way to spend an hour or so.

I wish the pieces were 25% bigger and had more memorable graphics.

This game does suffer a bit from the classic 'resource management solitaire', with a dash of AP but that is something that works well for our two player set-ups. My husband might like this a smidgen more than I do, but not by much. It's a very solid game and, despite the amount of bits, very straightforward to play (helped to watch play through videos before we started too) and didn't feel fiddly to us.    
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.9
I feel a little like this whole game is set up so that you never really have to worry about what numbers you roll. I can see some benefit from that; losing because you didn't roll as 'well' as someone else is frustrating, but why bother having the dice if every combination is good?

This game suffers from the usual Feldian 'everything you can do is worth something' and so each choice feels a little underwhelming; there are 29 things I can do, each is worth approximately 6 points... but as usual, smoothly put together and runs quickly. My favourite of the non-fillers from Mr. Feld.

I was not really liking this game at all until I realized near the end we were playing a fairly critical rule wrong regarding player turn order.  Now I think I might actually enjoy it.  It's still the typical Feld games of late, so I don't think it'll be a huge hit, but it doesn't seem like it'll be that bad a game in the end.

Tentative 5 now, may move to 7 or 3 depending upon how the next games go.

You play on your own board. You can`t destroy someones plan, but you must hurry up with taking tiles from the general board.

everything what you do will give you some abilities and/or points, but you must choose what gives you the most points.

The sooner you close an area the most points you will earn and maybe bonus points for closing all areas of a colour first or second.

You can score so many points playing this game!  You play the role of a land baron building out his domain, and buy different land tiles to place onto your own land.  While there are many little pieces to this game, playing your turn is not very complex.  It feels very fluid and feels satisfying to land large boatloads of points!  I would not recommend learning to play this game on your own, but conversely I think that everyone should play this game to get a taste of the excellent design that comes from Euro style games.

Here we have a perfect blend of random die rolls and strategy. We enjoy every game we play of this, and in fact, it's now one of our favourite 2-player games. I particularly like how from the start to the end of the game, you're still rolling the same 2 dice, but you can do so much more as your settlement grows!

(After several plays, it seems less messy and long, but it's still just okay.)

I need to play this again. A bit too much luck, but not odious. My initial impression is so-so, but may improve.

Finally got a second play. I don't find it a disagreeable game to play, but it just has too many things going on for too long, 25 rounds. On the whole, I'd be happier playing two or three less messy games.

Fiddly; awful color choices; good player mat playing aids; a lot of game for the money.

The theme is totally tacked-on and the game can get pretty fiddly with the replacing of tiles each round, but the game itself is still a lot of fun! I absolutely love the mechanic of being able to modify your dice rolls. It has saved me from a LOT of terrible rolling, and I probably would never have even looked at this game without it (not after my one and only game of Stone Age where I rolled a die above 3 maybe twice - never again!). There are many strategies to maximize your actions and point scores and the randomness of the tile setups ensure different paths to victory with each game. A great game overall!

Minor balance nit: Animal collection seems to be unusually cost efficient, yielding a lot of points such that other players must either follow suit in other animals, or aggressively spend actions to deny those tiles. I suppose it's part of the game, though, and I'll have to learn to plan around it during future plays.

12/2016: I feel like I've moved on from this game. The last few times I've played it I've mostly just gotten frustrated with my die rolls. I know mitigating that is part of the game, but I just don't enjoy the dryness of CoB's action shenanigans like I used to.

I love the combos in this game. I love games that score lots of points for things you do and this is the epitome of that type of game - nearly everything you do will get you some points or will lead to points later. Once you learn the play is very smooth. Toughest part is remembering what all the different buildings do - the player mat helps with this tremendously. Despite being 'easy' to play there is a lot going on so this is probably not a 'gateway' type of game.

3/26/2017: This is the only Feld's game that I have played so far, and this is the highest ranked from his design. I generally does not like a game that depends too much on luck, especially ones that rely heavily on the use of dices. This one is one of a few that convinces me that a dice game can still be strategic. I love how a player can try to push his/her luck and there is still a way to mitigate bad rolls. There are so many different ways that one can focus their attention on and try to score as much point as he/she can. I agree with what most people have voted that this game is best played with 2 players. The downtime between turns will become longer when you play with either 3 or 4 players. 

One criticism that I have for this game is the component quality. I hope it will get an upgrade with better quality component, because this game truly deserve it!

Overly long and AP-prone. When learning, I highly recommend that you play with just two. Even so, I simply didn't find the game fun. Point salad with multiple paths to victory. Is it done well? I suppose, but there are so many other games that do it better and with less reliance on dice. Without the dice, you can plan ahead and not feel the frustration of watching your opponents get exactly what they need while you get stymied. It's just another level of complexity that isn't needed, but nonetheless feels novel because it's dice in a strategic Euro. Like Bora Bora, Castles finds an interesting idea for a mechanic through dice, but bolts it onto a boring exercise in point scoring. No thanks.

All right, a nice Alea Big Box game, and it's a Feld, and it has dice.  That's a trifecta for me.  The advanced boards are excellent, as players are going for different things as the game starts.  The workers are a decent consolation prize for rolling very poorly, and they make it easier to get the results that you need.

My first play left me lukewarm, but subsequent plays keep increasing my appreciation of this game. The setup is daunting, but once all players know the rules (and can identify most of the knowledge tiles without consulting the rulebook) the gameplay smooths out considerably. Playing with different boards for each player may increase the luck factor, but I'd say it's more fun that way. Just a very solid, fun, fairly deep euro.

Clearance at B&N

Here is what piqued my interest for this game. I overheard this, "I only lost because you took my chickens." I have to learn this game.

This game is very unique "Point-salad" style game. Different strategies, different boards, different tiles drawn makes this game very replayable.

It is amazing how many times you can think "anything but 3's" and you will roll 3's!

This game shines at three players. It is an excellent 2 player game.

Edit: Terrible Name...That kept me away until the chicken thing.

RATING: 7
I resisted this game because I did not enjoy Trajan and everything about Feld's games are unappealing to me.  But this is his consensus best game, so I figured I should give it a try.  We played the rules a bit wrong at the beginning and that resulted in a shorter game than it should have been.  I also got thoroughly crushed by the guy that had played the game several times before.  I definitely need to give it a try now that I understand the basic strategies a bit.

Overall, I liked what I saw.  It has some dice placement, tile laying, and combo building, all of which are mechanics I enjoy.  It's still a bit point-salad-y for my tastes, but not as egregious as Trajan.  And while it relatively themeless, there was enough theme to make some of the mechanics intuitive.  Which is really all I ask.

Need to play more, haven't figured it out. I tend to get really excited and spend my silverlings too early for good but suboptimal moves. It's a VERY good game though. Rating likely to improve with more plays as I feel better when I play. Still a bit boring art and dry play, but not too bad.

Somehow Stefan Feld manages to use dice as an incredibly good action selection system. You always feel as though there is something you can do and rarely ever get terrible rolls, just some that are better than others. You can mod to do one good action or do two or if you plan well can do multiple actions. 

It's intuitive yet clever. No AP, you could play it super strategic or play on a whim and still have a good time (the latter will make you lose but you will still get a sense of accomplishment). The scoring system is really good, the different paths you can take to victory, and the way you have to plan your construction while adapting to the rolls. 

There is just the right amount of actions, not too many, but enough to make it interesting. I looove how you can chain the actions and as such I like castles and buildings that give you free tiles, and collecting silverlings. But all of the strategies are fun to play, and it's easy to mix it up and try different things. 

And I have to mention the scoring system again, which pushes you to try and build quickly, so you have to choose between quick building vs efficient building.

This is a wonderful game.  The myriad of choices one must make on every turn make this endlessly re-playable.  No one I've played it with has come back to say that it wasn't fun.

Sep 2012 - Good game. I'd definitely play again. Not looking to own it though, probably too AP inducing for my husband. 

Feb 2017 - finally bought a copy with a gift voucher and played it with my husband...and he likes it!  (Which is great, the most recent new game he tried was patchwork, and he hated it). I was right about the AP though. It took over 3 hours for a two player game! (Including the teaching). Looking forward to trying again now that he has the hang of it.

Castles of Burgundy certainly fits the Alea mold - there's no doubt this is a gamer's game and not family fare. However, I'm a little surprised the ratings so far are this high (7.82 average for 292 ratings as I write this in late April 2011). I won't argue that Burgundy is a solid offering with some clever parts to it. However, there are flaws that I suspect will keep this from matching the lofty ratings I've given some of the best games in the Alea line. First and foremost, this is almost a complete abstract - the theme is somewhere between paper-thin and nonexistent. It's far from elegant - the set-up and round upkeep is definitely a bit fiddly with all the small counters. I also fear it may have some balance issues - ships and mines in some combination seem pretty essential to victory, and they'll get snapped up by the start player every time. I also wonder if the luck factor - hey, it does use dice, even if bad rolls can be mitigated a bit with workers - is too high for a game of this length and complexity. All that said, I realize there's some real depth here and more to explore, but I am doubtful this will ever rise beyond a 7 rating for me - a good game but not a great one. I guess it's a tribute to the Alea line that I expect great rather than good from them ...

Not too impressed so far. The "strategy" is basically optimizing to get the best tiles available during your turn, tweak a dice roll here and there and score some points in a game that feels like it takes forever. Don't really see the appeal, I never want to play this again. So many better games out there.

Love it. Never get tired of it. I've started logging which board I play with the goal of playing them all. Excellent replayability.

It's a very tactical game as well as strategic.

It's a clever points-collection game that uses dice to determine your possible actions (except that it's pretty damn easy to change your die results to instead conduct the actions you actually want to do).  I haven't played many Feld games, but I do find the ones I have played to be a little too "I'll do my thing, you do your thing, and we'll compare our scores at the end" for my tastes.

RATING: 7
Yet another good game with interesting dice mechanisms. However,not quite as intriguing as Macao to my mind. Where Macao hits a sweet spot being somewhat a hybrid of both a tactical and strategical game, The castles of Burgundy are all about tactical decision making. So much in fact, that I'd rather plead for some more strategy. That being said by someone who loves himself some tactical gaming. 

Great thing about it is though that the next session could be totally different. And the next one again, and again and ... Tons of options, tons of randomness.

City/countryside development powered by unpredictability. Each turn you use two dice to randomly determine what buildings you can plan, what board locations you can build upon, what goods you can sell, and what resources you can gather. Careful planning and management of the randomness is rewarded with points from a variety of categories.

The first several times I played I had to constantly ask "How do you score points again?" because there are so many multi-step processes involved.

A worthy addition to the collection.  A nice variety of strategies and lots of replayability mean I won't get tired of this soon (plus, I have a soft spot for Euros with dice.)  A few dings, though.  First, setup is a little annoying for what it is.  Second, the theme is both overdone and pasted on.  Third, it rarely provides me with the sort of brain-smashing agonizing decisions I really like in games.  But it's a fun challenge and a great way to spend an hour.

Man, this is such a tight game. The elegance and simplicity of the mechanics are just so good that the dry Euro elements and plain art don't even matter. It's possible that this game might even ultimately be a 10 (always want to play) for me, but I think I want a couple more plays in first.

Recently learned how to hand-sew drawstring bags so we could better store the tiles and cut down on cleanup/setup time! Opaque baggies are a must. (10-20-17)

While the theme/artwork is not its strong suit, Castles of Burgundy is still an extremely satisfying game in terms of gameplay and balance.

When you first look at The Castles of Burgundy on the store shelves you may look right over it because flashy it is not. The Castles of Burgundy was released by Ravensburger and to me feels like it comes from the old guard of Euro greatness even though it was released in 2011. It stands with games like Puerto Rico and Agricola as top tier, world class Euro games when people give suggestions for what to play. After playing The Castles of Burgundy a decent number of times I can wholeheartedly agree with all the good press the game has received. Firstly the designer is one you may know: Stefan Feld. If you don’t know Stefan Feld that’s ok but I’m hoping that this article along with the how to play video I plan to produce will bring him to your attention.

As I’ve stated in many of my other reviews I’m fairly new to tabletop gaming and have only seriously been playing since early 2015. Since I am newer to the hobby I have the joy of going through the back catalog of games from prestigious designers. The first designer I started with was Uwe Rosenberg, and that has been a fun journey. I’m now exploring the catalog of Stefan Feld and this is just as much fun but completely different in every way. There are a few significant differences in the way that these two designers work. Where as Uwe is about optimization within very tight framework, Stefan is about optimization in a system filled with abundance. There are so many points, so many choices and a bit of randomness thrown in for good measure. This isn’t to say that Stefan Feld’s games aren’t superbly designed or unbalanced, it’s simply to say that you get a much different feel playing a Stefan Feld game than most other tight Euros. In Castles of Burgundy, as with many other Feld titles that I have played, the points flow freely and most of your choices feel like good choices. Even if your choices aren’t necessarily as good as they could be they feel good.

There is one thing about The Castles of Burgundy that hit me from the very beginning of my exposure to it. The basic framework of the game system is fairly straightforward. The mechanics are satisfying and make sense. Within that solid mechanical system there are tons of choices that will impact you in different ways and make each play feel unique. So even though the game is very simple in it’s initial offering take one of four actions based on what you roll, actually picking those actions to maximize your effectiveness is very interesting indeed. I’ll go into a bit more depth about the types of actions you can take and the types of choices those actions present. 

The board is set up in a circular fashion where tile depots around the board will determine which dice are required to take tiles from that depot. So for instance there is a number one depot that has access to two - four tiles depending on the number of players. The depots go from one to six to match what you can roll on your dice. At the start of the round each player rolls their dice and plans their actions. Then each player in turn order gets to take two actions with their two dice. The first type of action you can take is placing a tile from one of the depots in your tile storage. This action is simple, you can spend a die showing a three, to take any of the tiles from the three depot. Your tile storage space can store up to three tiles so that limits you a bit, but in general that’s the first action you can take. 

The second action you can take is building tiles from your tile storage onto your player board that shows your own personal kingdom. This is where a lot of the game’s choice and complexity comes in. There are a number of different tiles that will give you special bonuses when you build them, at the end of the round or at the end of the game. You could build one of the eight different buildings to start building up city zones on your player board. Each of the eight buildings give you a special bonus whether it be taking a tile from the middle with no required action or gaining silver etc. You could build a castle that will then allow you to take a free action as if you had a die of any result. You can place livestock tiles that will give you bonuses if you combo animals of the same type. You can place ships that let you gather goods to sell and move you on the turn order track. These are just a few examples of all of the available options to players. All of this goes to show that the options in this game are many and the rewards are good. 

In addition to all of the bonuses that these tiles give you rewards are given for completing all of a certain type of tile first. So for instance if you are the first player to complete a zone or all of the castles on the board you will gain bonus victory points. So there is a high reward for efficiency both with your time and your tile placement, which is quite satisfying when you get a really interesting combo to work. Usually I will try to go for the bonuses or actions that other players are not pursuing, which usually means that I’m doing something completely different than the game before. This variability is a huge strength to The Castles of Burgundy. I haven’t even begun to scratch the surface of the other parts of the game that can be mixed like the unique player boards or expansions that can be purchased, just the base box provides quite a bit of content.

The Castles of Burgundy stands a cut above most games. There are certain games that when you play them you instantly feel the genius behind the design even if the game is not your speed. When you feel the genius and you also love the mechanics then you truly have a wonderful experience ahead of you with many plays to come. With the expansions mentioned above that are available to provide more variability and more player boards to provide a different target I think I’ll be interested for years to come. 

I’ve currently collected five of Stefan Feld’s games and The Castles of Burgundy is my favorite. There’s plenty of tension at two players but three and four play very well too. Strategies will change based on the player count but balance will not and I feel that this is another reason that the genius of this design is evident. For instance in a four player game good tiles are much more important at four points each, but in a two player game you can win without focusing solely on them. In a four player game the goods are worth more but they are harder to get, so it tends to even out. 

Another incredible aspect to The Castles of Burgundy is the price tag. At $42 USD I feel that the content you receive for the investment is outstanding. The tile laying and puzzle solving aspects will keep your mind engaged and the free flowing points will keep you satisfied as you explore this strategic sandbox of a game. I would highly recommend picking The Castles of Burgundy up if you get the chance and if you don’t like it let me know and I may buy it off you!

Had a great time with this game.  I suspect I won't get it to the table very often with my current group, as it falls a little on the heavy-Euro end of my collection, but I'd play it with a group of regular players just about any time.  Lots of strategy and, like all of Feld's best games, many ways to score points.  I have tried different approaches to victory in each game with varying degrees of success, and there isn't a single way that proves to be more assured than any other.  Sometimes shipping and agriculture score highly; sometimes it's city building.  Players MUST navigate choices early on to determine what type of game they'll try to play, and that changes quickly and often.

RATING: 7
I'm quite amazed I like a game with dice in it. It is probably due to the fact that you don't really roll to do things here but you use the dice to place tiles and you can manipulate them if you don't like the results (at the cost of workers but unless you are really unlucky it is not game changing because you can choose other actions that are also interesting). One minus is the theme, which is meaningless and could be easily replaced by whatever else without it affecting the game. However, it is smooth, fairly quick and entertaining game. I am not sure about replayability, though. I need to play it more than once to settle my first impressions.

Ok game. Being the starter player each round provides an advantage which is too big and it depends on the starting player if he or she wants to 'give away' being the starting player. Some buildings are too powerful compared to others too. I don't understand the fuss around this game

RATING: 7
This...is not for me. I am not a fan of most Euros, to put it mildly. And Burgundy is so Euro, that other board games that spend too long next to it start mutating into Euros. And man oh man that theme. The designer basically said, "You know what? Screw it. Art is for suckers."

And yet, I do admit that I can see why people enjoy it so much. Once you get into the swing of things and realize what you need to do - not an easy thing with the steep learning curve - it does become very elegant in its resource-managing design.

EDIT: Played again after a long hiatus and much more gaming experience, and...my opinion went up. I need to play it at least once more, but I actually had fun. Maybe because we played with only two players, it hummed along nicely. I would play again if offered.

The entire concept of rolling dice to use more or less as currency in a highly ranked game got me really excited, and the game did not disappoint.  Well paced, designed and fun to play around with.

Castles of Burgundy is darn near perfect. The rules are pretty easy to explain, and anyone with any experience in games can quickly pull off some nice combos. I really admire the way that dice play such a central role without making the game feel too luck-based.

Been contemplating on getting this game off-and-on for a while now. I enjoy the game and I think it was incredibly well-designed. The amount of symbols and images in the game, however, is large, so it's difficult to look at the board and figure out the best plays at a glance. I hope to play this a few more times to get over that learning curve.

This is definately a Euro with some depth. Knowledge of all the numerous pieces and how they interact with eachother is necessary to play the game well. It also helps to have a feel for where and when to spend workers to affect the dice. There are some powerful pieces that when obtained early can provide significant long term advantage (such as behaving like a free worker). I will have to play more before I feel solid on my rating of this. I'm not sure at the moment where I rate it against other deep Euros.

First Impression:

An oldschool euro, with excellent gameplay and neglected if passable theme. 

I'm quite full of bland themes and I dislike the use of dice in euros. However this game is acceptable, as the theme does manage to carry through somewhat (despite minimum effort from the production) and the use of dice as randomizers is actually very well implemented (even if still not cool). Other than that, the game works and rocks from a mechanichs point of view, offering simple yet tough choices, a rewarding gameplay and a lot of interaction.

This game appears to be Feld at its best and seems of exceptional design. However it just doesn't captivate me as some modern games that manage to best combine the best of both worlds (strategy and theme) which this game doesn't try to do.

Yeah, it's yet another euro about building up a medieval kingdom/principality to gather the most victory points. Hardly a novel or inspiring theme. But like Hansa Teutonica everything in the game works so well that it is enjoyable to play. The play isn't like HT's, but my reaction is similar. I've moved on in my gaming tastes from wanting the latest variation in the euro genre just because it's new and shiny or combines the same dozen mechanics in a slightly different way. However I do appreciate quality, and like HT a couple of years ago this game delivers on that. I don't think it will ever be a top favorite, and time will tell whether it will reveal a dominant strategy that limits its replayability, but for now I'm perfectly to slot it in beside the othe big box Alea games in my collection and give it at least a number of additional plays.

What a simple game to play that looks semi complicated from looking into it.  I can't think of a way to eliminate the white die, but i don't like its inclusion.  It isn't annoying and doesn't get in the way, but these types of design decisions where clever game designers like Feld come up with ingenious ideas.  I'm just complaining about a trivial detail of a very very good game.

1 play.  Many many more will follow.

RATING: 10
 Very cool game where the die throws don't kill you and you can always use them even if it's to get workers which is a lesser option but still works. 

UPDATE, rating raised to a 9 since I played the game with the new player boards/rule which really adds a wonderful level to an already brilliant game. 

This game does have very little player interaction so it makes for the perfect 2 player experience. Not to say the other player doesn't matter as they always seem to take the tile you want but the game play itself is great at 2.

I'm only giving this game a 9.0 for now just because I've only played it once (well 3 times but the other 2 we werent playing the rules right) and I LOVED IT! 

But I will progressively change my score for when I play it more. We'll see!

So far I love the amount of options one can claim victory in the game. The dice rolling is fun and it may have some luck involved but the fact that you can manipulate that luck with workers is great!

RATING: 10
Castles of Burgundy is an incredible game.  It has the distinction of being the game my wife loves most.  This is sublime with two and good with three and a little long with four.  

You take and place tiles based on die rolls.  There are ways to mitigate the luck of dice, namely workers that let you adjust die rolls and being somewhat deliberate in where you place tiles so as to open up new potential places to place items.  Many tiles give you special abilities, some of which help to take or place tiles, some of which help you get money or workers.  There is quite often a battle for start player and there are various strategies that you can take, some of which will depend on which individual player board you play.  

Even taking advantage of every opportunity it is impossible to fill your board completely so you should have a plan how you're going to get points.  Filling areas scores points, more for scoring early and more for filling large areas.  There are also tiles that give bonus points.

It's a well balanced game.  It sometimes feels like multiplayer solitaire, although it isn't.  One of my favorite games.

This was our first eurogame. It was also our first "adult" game with what at the time seemed to be a daunting set of rules. However after the first game we found that the rules were actually very understandable and the only time we needed the manual was to interpret a few of the knowledge tile symbols. Now this game is one of our favorites.

The Castles of Burgandy - Alea Big Box #14, bought from Macek at Buckland Hills Mall parking lot Manchester CT. Now that I've played it, it is likely to be one of my very favorites of the Alea series. Easy to play with Huge amounts of depth.

I've now taught the game a couple times and am really getting the hang of it. I thought I won at UGXVIII in a really tight game (my best yet!) but came in a close 2nd. I can't wait to try playing with different boards for each player. This one has really caught my attention.

Always fun. Haven't tried it with more than 2, afraid that the downtime might become unpleasant. This is a game we'll play as long as we play games.

Later: One of our three or four favorite games, always super-competitive and tense, just a perfect game (except the art and components, obv). We got the Trade Routes mini-expansion, and it's terrific, adds just a little twist, though it can be brutal to watch your opponent combo with that thing! What a great, great game. We always play with board #1, because we don't like using unbalanced boards, but still we play it all the time--"replayability" doesn't only come from variety, this game is replayable because it's addictive. Still, we should seek out some more expansions, probably.

Later: We made photocopies of the other boards so we could play them while still being balanced. They add some fun variety for sure.

The game is set in the Middle Age in France (Burgund[y]). Players slip into the role of an aristocrat and at the beginning they reign over a small princedom. While playing they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of the travelling people.
The game is about placing settlement tiles into the princedom. Every tile has its own function which starts to work when the tile is placed. The princedom itself consist of several countrysides and every countryside demands its own settlement tile.
The core mechanism of the game involves 2 dice. The pips show the kind of action the players are allowed to do (example: roll a "2" and a "5: using the "2" the player buys a watch tower and places it on a "5" city tile which triggers the function of the tower with additional advantages).
It's also possible to influence the dice, so using the dice is not completely subject to luck. 
There will be a beginner and a master version of the game rules.

The Castles of Burgundy is my favorite Feld game. The knowledge tiles add interesting adjustments. It seems balanced because you can't concentrate too much on one area.

Good:

-Tons of different yet successful strategies
-Fun combos
-Mitigatable randomness
-Different player maps

Bad:
-For gamers only
-Player order matters a little too much
-Early mines are too good
-Can be a beast to teach
-No player aids
-Game length

Overall:
One of my favorite Euros due to variance injected by the dice.  Printing out some player aids goes a long way to getting this game to hit the table more.  I enjoy it whenever I play, but ultimately that doesn't happen too often due to the burden of entry.

Juego en el que los puntos podemos conseguirlos de varias maneras. Es muy divertido ir construyendo tu reino mientras te centras en ciertas partes para conseguir puntos. Cada parte del reino que construyes, te da algún tipo de bonificación o accion extra.

Es uno de mis favoritos y la hora que dura se te pasa volando. Como punto negativo, los materiales dejan mucho que desear.

Finally played it...and loved it. I must admit that I really like some of the older titles by Stefan Feld, especially Im Jahr Des Drachen and Notre Dame, and this game has the same addictive quality. It took a little time to remember all the possible player actions and special powers (even though they are all referenced by tiny illustrations on the player boards), but after that the game played really smoothly. And instead of pain (a trademark of Stefan's older games), this game gives you so many options to obtain points that it really makes you greedy. Liked it a lot with three players, would like to try with two.
UPDATE: Played with two and loved it the same as with three. While playing, I am fully aware of the fact that I am enjoying myself a great deal. And the dice just make this game highly replayable. Magic.
UPDATE: Played this game ten times now, and have enjoyed it every single time. Don't expect this to change in the future - apparently, this game offers everything I enjoy at just the right levels of complexity and game length. Raised my rating to a ten.

A very Feldian design with die rolls limiting set actions but having enough choices as well as die modifiers to offset the role of luck in the game. Make no mistake, the die will still bite you occasionally when you want to take a desperate last minute action but you can't due to a bad roll. Overall, a very solitaire feel to the game with very limited interaction. The only interaction from the game comes from tile choices and availability which means if you go down a path where no one else is taking, then you are safe. However, if everyone is pursuing their own agenda,vthe game becomes more like a solo puzzle. The only teo things that i consider are negatives are the constant scoring ehich i find somewhat tedious and potentially error prone and also the length of the game. That said, I have enjoyed most of Feld's designs and this is no exception.

RATING: 6
Very high level of "You totally went where I wanted to go" game play. Like Macao with less foresight, there are plenty of things to do, limited by dice rolls, mitigated by additional mechanics. Somewhat Kingsburg-ish in that respect, but with many, many more options. 

Player interaction is also on par with KB, but entirely more maddening as resources are extremely limited. I found myself forcing my gaze away from the board when it wasn't my turn, as nearly every round my carefully laid plans would be shot to hell by the player in front of me. 

While I enjoy the planning ahead aspect of Macao, I like DBvB's similar dice-selection mechanic just as interesting. It's a slightly different beast, but just as enjoyable.

This was sold to me as it plays so well with small crowd (I don't have too many of such games). It indeed does that and the player boards really make this a gem if you bother to get into it. Various boards truly demand different approaches and having a good number of combinations adds surprise and replayability. For some reason it hasn't been easy to market but all I have coerced into giving it a go have returned for more. For those who have a need for a solid medium euro that can stretch the number of players from two to four for real.

I find this game very frustrating. It's laying a puzzle where pieces are being removed randomly (just when you need them, of course). Yes, you can mitigate against it. Yes, it applies to the other player(s) too (if you compete for player order and get first choice). But the problem is that I dislike the experience.  That type of mechanic occurs in other games too, but for reasons I don't understand it irritates me a lot in this game.

It wasn't for lack of trying. I've played the game 15 times!

This game sat in a closet un-opened for at least a year for some reason.  Remembered it and dragged it out after reading an article that mentioned Stefan Feld.  The game is great.  I really regret not opening this one sooner.  
Set up is a little heavy, it can be long, and the learning curve is really high (we're moderately active table top players, might not be as bad for someone used to complex games).  But once into the game it is engaging and a lot of fun. Feld does a great job of randomizing and controlling power-play type aspects making for a very fair and strategy based game.  Randomization and  multiple game boards ensure lots of re-play opportunity as well.

I enjoy playing The Castles of Burgundy, and find it to be one of the most relaxing games in my collection. However, I would not consider it to be one of the deepest Euros in my collection as it seems to suffer from "Feld syndrome"-  almost any action you take will score you points, so final scores are usually remarkably close. Usually the player who makes a few marginally better decisions will win, and it is very difficult to determine why one player performed better than another. That being said, I like the game, but if I want to play a heavy Euro for 2 players with lots of strategic depth, I will play something else instead.

Let's start with the frustrating bits: There are tons of little pieces that need to be organized and doled out each round, the colors are not distinct enough to it's really muddy and hard to delineate piece types, and at player counts above 2 it slows down exponentially.

Good news: it makes an awesome 2-player game (even 3, 4 gets too slow for me), once you adjust your eyes a bit you are able to tell the pieces apart and it speeds up, there are lots of paths to victory, and the game is just darn fun. Liked it more than I thought I would and binge-played it for a week and share it with gamer friends every chance we get.

The first dice euro i ever played, and still my favourite (although I'm yet to try Bora Bora). At their best, Feld's designs seem to resemble the work of a Swiss watchmaker; all the mechanisms click together and the thing just hums. I love the unerring rhythm of this game, especially with 2 players.

Totally pasted-on theme, components are a bit crappy, and I'm not much of a Feld fan. But I can't help liking this game. Maybe I'm a sucker for optimization, but I'm always engaged by this. One would think that after years of being played heavily online by a bunch of Germans, someone would have figured out an inbalance in this game's scoring (yeah, the boards are not balanced). But no, there is 0 consensus on what to do. Which is just wonderful.

distinctive use of dice so that no particular number rolled is necessarily more valuable.  Worthy dice-modifier established with the concept of the Workers.

But overloaded with too many mechanisms all in one package to match my preferred level of play.  I see it as a distraction rather than an enticement.  I'd wish to see some things dropped out to provide a more streamlined product.

Oct 2017: We finally got to play this one in March, and am finally getting around to rating it.  This is easily one of our favorite games that isn't quite like anything else we have.  Setup can be a bit annoying (and the box organization sucks), but once set up it's an engaging game that is just the right weight.  There's a lot to think about and a wide range of strategies that work, but you'll also find yourself adapting based on the luck of the dice and what's actually available on the board.  This really scratches that Civilization itch for us without being so complex it turns into a headache.

Gave to N for Crimbo 2013;

After playing this one a number of times on Yucata.de, I definitely have warmed up to it a lot.

2017 Update: I've played this enough for the sheen to wear off again. The most interesting mechanic in the game (dice restricting your options) is neutered by being a non-restriction. The theme does not exist. The set-up time is too long. While the random nature of the dice is completely neutered, the luck of the draw on which tiles show up can be very swingy. Not one to get rid of, but also not one I'm chomping at the bit to play more of.

Would it kill Feld to design something thematic?  His games are always tightly-balanced interesting beefy affairs that feel like nothing so much as blandly counting points over and over and over again.  He's got a great mix of short-term gain with long-term strategy here, but the theme is offensively thin.  Towns, castles, boats, livestock and technologies are all nearly the same, and used only as extremely sparse justification for different currencies and scoring systems.

RATING: 9.4
Another phenomenal Feld dice game, instant smash hit here in the household. Each player rolls 2 dice, then uses the dice to perform various actions, such as using your 6 to take a tile from the "6" area on the board, or use your 2 to place a previously taken tile on one of the predefined "2 spots" on your personal board.

There are only 4 actions to learn, but the game has an amazing amount of variety in it, and different ways to score points. 4 different kinds of animals which score bonus points when grouped with their own kinds, 8 different kinds of buildings, each building with it's own unique benefit, such as money, points, dice modifiers, extra tiles, etc. Mines earn extra money, ships bring in goods which get sold for points and money, and then 26 special tiles provide bonus abilities and point multipliers of your other tiles. Further to all this, you get points for filling in areas on your board, so specializing is also good.

Essentially, you want everything, but can't have it all. But that's good, as you always feel like there's something good to grab or do with every dice roll. People who hate dice should still like this game, as rolling high or low has nothing to do with doing well, and there are ample opportunities to get dice modifiers, to help those times when you want a 3 instead of a 4 or 2. A nice touch is that dice wrap, a modified 6 becomes a 1, again, really helping you out.

Just a fantastic game. Highly recommended.

What is more, the dice rolls can definitely be mitigated by a healthy stack of workers. In the end, an excellent point salad.

One four player game behind, it took some time to get the rules straight, because none of us was very experienced. With four players the downtime gets quite high, because the other players' actions most likely affect your moves - meaning that you can't think your moves completely on other players' turns. Could be better with two players.

The mechanics are interesting, the quality is good, but lots of special tiles and a pasted-up theme combined with the downtime mentioned before mean this is not my favorite.

One of Feld's best  (second only to Bora Bora IMO).  Tons of fun choices and things to do.  Can be taught to and enjoyed by almost any crowd.  Not a perfect game though: the theme is basically pasted-on and it's dry as dirt.  I also have difficulty differentiating and remembering all of the different brown tiles.  The cargo mechanic is also tacked-on and pretty uninteresting.  Still, it never gets old chucking dice and building up a miniature kingdom full of cows, pigs, sheep, and chickens.

BGG's rating for 8 summarized my opinion well:
"Very good - enjoy playing and would suggest it."

Mechanics fit well together, there were multiple ways to succeed, and I rarely felt punished for my decisions. I like the varied player boards as options as well. My only complaint would be that it was just a tiny tad too simplistic for my personal tastes, keeping it from a 9. That might just be my non-Eurogamer past speaking anyway.

The high standard of medium weight euro game design. There is so much to like in this game. Variable player boards, dice allocation, works well at all player counts, little downtime between turns. It is so satisfying when you pull off a nice little combo on your turn. I feel in this game the best player always come out on top, even though you get points for everything you do. You have to carefully watch your opponents as the rounds go by and adjust accordingly. This is a game I keep forever.

A little long for what it is, so don't play this with anyone that even remotely suffers from AP. With 3 fast players this was kinda enjoyable. Typical Feld point salad with not enough interaction for my tastes, but the spatial puzzle is pretty engaging. Update: after a handful of plays I'm more or less done. I'll play if asked, but see no need to own as there is little left to explore in the system and the INTERACTION IS WAY TOO LOW.

One of my first WOW games and my introduction to Stephan Feld.  This one that stands the test of time. I could play this game weekly and it wouldn't get old. The art/color scheme could be better as could the components but it's a cheap game that is wonderfully designed. Play this if you haven't!

RATING: 8.7
This worked well with the kids after I convinced them to finish a full game.  By the fifth phase we were going through the rounds VERY quickly, and we could each see how the scoring fit together.  There are many ways to score points, but they interact with each other, and the "points building on points" mechanisms are fun to figure out without giving anyone a runaway victory.

As a fan of games that have non-intrusive randomness in them, I really like the way this game becomes less dependent on randomness as it continues; by the second half of the game you have access to knowledge tiles and workers that make your desired rolls much more likely, and the endgame is a matter of cleaning up the strategies you stumbled into in the opening of the game.

My absolute FAVORITE thing about this game is how the kids are figuring out the value of mitigating randomness on their own.

RATING: 6
Like Troyes, DBvB uses dice as a random method to determine a tactical move, and like Troyes, you're not specifically restricted to exactly what you rolled on the dice to do something on your turn.  Of course, rolling the number you  need is better, but you're never without something to do just because you didn't roll a 5 when you needed it.  Aside from modifier abilities, the game provides enough options with any given die to allow players to branch out and build up their tableau for better turns in the future.

There are a lot of tiles to keep up with in the game, along with the abilities they grant the players, so this isn't for a bits-averse gamer.  The better you understand the abilities and how they relate to the actions you can take, the better you'll do in the game, so the learning curve is a little inclined, if not necessarily steep.  The turns are straightforward (roll two dice, and take two actions based on your numbers); it's understanding how to use those actions to your best benefit that's the challenge of the game.

I'm not sure if this is a game I would play often, much less own, but it fills its own niche, and is satisfying enough as a game.  The randomness of the dice can lead to frustrations, but the special abilities of certain tiles can put you in a position where a bad roll can still do a lot for you.

Heavier family title. As always, Feld's game has high threshold of entry, but once you're past it, game is very relaxing. It's a light game in disguise. 
First impression was good, but after 5 games I'm officially bored. It has this Feldish flavour - whatever you do, you gain gazillions of points. Good game to boost your self-esteem; maybe that's the reason for Feldmania...?

Last but not least, too long for what it is. 3h with 4 players - really? I'm on the fence with this one. Won't sell it soon (noobs like it a lot), but I have so much more fun playing other games. Heavy gamers: you've been warned.

One of my favourites.  Always come back to this and enjoy it.  Great mix of time vs what you want to build.  With the added tension of racing all the other players to collect tiles and complete sections on your player board.  Once you know how to play this game flows very well.

A game where you build on your tableau but there is really no interaction with other players. The lack of any screwage and because of that there is no reason to pay attention when other players take their turns makes this a game that falls a little flat for me.

I've played this well over 30 times now. It's easily one of my favorite work placement games.  I knew it the first time I played it. The choices you make from your die actions are interesting and challenging.  The buildings you build can make your actions a lot more powerful and the game challenges you to make the most of each decision.  Even in high scoring games (200+) the scores get so close sometimes.  
The art and the pieces are not of great quality but the game play is great so I don't care.

Best Euro we have played so far. Not many worker placement games are as well suited for couples. The fact that you never feel like there is only one good option you are competing for, but just "so much good stuff to chose from" sets this game apart. We love it.

One of my favourite games. Find it very relaxing. Plays very well with 2. Probably helps that it is also my partners favourite game. Only thing holding it back from getting a 10 straight away is not knowing how replayable it will be. I'm still trying out different strategies as I play but don't know if I'll one day get to point where I just go into autopilot.

I've only played 3 times as of this comment, but this game has definitely lived up to the hype.  Really enjoyable, lots of choices, but not too difficult.

Great game at 2 players, but as others have said it gets MUCH longer with more players.

A fun use of dice that provides lots of different choices!  I liked that everyone rolls their dice simultaneously and can be planning their moves (to some extent) while waiting for their turn. 

When we played a 4P game, everyone originally seemed to focus on different aspects (animals vs castles vs shipping etc), but by the end of the game everyone seemed to have dipped into most of the areas. When played 2P and 3P, our boards didn't fill up as much by the end of the game, and everyone ended up specializing a bit more.  I preferred this quite a bit.  With fewer options from which to choose, gameplay with 2P was pretty brisk as well.

May not stay in the collection for too long, but in my opinion is a classic design.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is the game that made Stefan Feld a superstar game designer and it's not hard to see why. It's basically a tile laying game, but the selection of tiles is not blind, but instead limited by the role of the dice. Randomness is randomness, but there is something supremely satisfying about rolling some dice and making the random results work for your strategy.

Many of the tiles trigger abilities when placed as well, which provides even more to think about when you make your selections. I think this is why the game has found so much success, as it appeals to both the planners and the folks who just wing it...and because of the dice, neither is really at a disadvantage.

The only complaints to lodge are the rather flimsy components. The cardboard is paper thin and the player mats even thinner. They tiles are also quite small, meaning there isn't much on them but a tiny picture of a usually indescript building. This leads to lots of rule book referencing to puzzle out what everything does for the first couple of plays or if you come back to it after a hiatus.

Still, compared to the sheer amount of enjoyment the game provides the complaints are fairly minor. Just about anyone can get into this game and judging by the BGG ranks, almost everyone has.

RATING: 9
More elegant (half-sized rulebook) and more austere than Agricola (explains the much more accessible pricetag) with perhaps even greater replayability.  Somewhat simpler strategic interaction but with much more variation on starting conditions and early-game objectives; far less brain-crunching pressure to maximize before "harvest".

Dice, but they have an effect that can be mitigated to the degree that suits the player or strategy (dice 'risk' is a thing that can, at a cost, be managed).

Excellent game.

It's pleasant enough, and an enjoyable tactical game. I have a hard time seeing any real depth here, or much to learn past the initial and fairly obvious lessons. For tougher choices, it should either be one phase shorter or each phase should have four rounds.

After more plays, with more boards, I just can't get too enthused about it. It's too long and too on rails. I've never seen score separation greater than 5%. Barring extreme variances of luck, that is, and there's more luck here than initially meets the eye, esp. in tile draws, but also in die rolls and safe bets that may not pan out.

It's a fine, pleasant game but I do not get its popularity.

It's kind of nice to figure out what your dice are good for, and pulling of combo chains, but animals and yellow tiles that give you points are just so boring.

Getting on the dice action bandwagon, this Euro does a decent job of mitigating the luck while allowing a number of different ways to score points.  There's 9 different player maps to keep things fresh.  This is primarily a tile placement game where the tiles give special actions or abilities.

This game is not for me. It has some quite clever mechanisms, and I can see how it could be quite replayable for players who enjoy economic Euros.

A great design with a brilliant dice allocation mechanism. This is definitely a keeper, I always have a good time with this game. It plays beautifully with 2 players (though I wish there was a bit more interaction woven into this design). And although I've played many superior euros since my first introduction to The Castles of Burgundy, it's always a joy to go back to this one. It's one of those lovely evergreens.

There's only one caveat - I feel that the asymmetrical boards are not perfectly balanced and were not created equal, some are easier to play than others. Just stick to symmetrical #1 boards if you want a 100% fair game.

Economy of action; 2 actions per turn and 4 choices for each action makes for a bewildering swarm of intellectual permutations and a passionate desire for clairvoyance.

What I Love-
Dice management. Low luck due to making correct plays to be able to manage the dice rolls. The variety of strategies available. The ability to chain together actions. Tension about grabbing what you want before your opponent. The Black Market. Squeezing out that extra action with the buildings. 2-player. 

What I Dislike-
A lot of bits to setup. Waiting on Analysis Prone players at higher play counts. (even so, the gameplay is Sublime)

It is one of those extremely rare games whose average rating grows over time, giving a hint that it may be a game which requires repeated plays to like it, but so far (after 1 play) I got disappointed. Too much abstract tile pusher.

Thematically nonsensical victory point salad game in true Feld style.  Still, the die-rolling mechanism, with luck mitigated by using workers, works well, and the game speeds along at a good clip, making for a surprisingly satisfying game.  Pity about the sub-par components and art.

RATING: 9
[EDIT]
the game itself is a full 9 when played on the PC. Otherwise the setup and teardown are too long.


---------------
the rating for the game alone could be higher but:
 - the rule book is available only in ancient aramaic, too difficult to understand
 - tiles and player boards are made of lousy material

The game: long to explain but very rewarding, loads of tension, you can't wait for your next turn, high speed, loads of things to do and only two actions, many strategies to follow, a lot of richness and possibilities... very good game indeed, a shame for those two first negative aspects. 
Maybe it is a bit too long...

Rating after 1 play. I expect the rating to go up rather than down with more plays.

A typical Euro: Weak theme, indirect interaction, lots of options, lots of ways to score points. But if you like Euros, it's very fun to play. And for the interaction? More often than not do the other players invalidate my plans, when i'm late in turn order.

RATING: 3
This game has entirely turned me off to ever wanting to try a Stefan Feld game again. This was probably the heaviest game I had tried at the time I picked it up. For a while I assumed that I simply liked lighter games and that was my major problem with this game. I did not enjoy trying to teach the game because I was new to the hobby and so was my wife who is my main gaming partner. Trying to learn this was rather difficult even with online videos and I have come to the conclusion that the reason for this is that the theme is so loose that I could not attach mechanics in my head to what we were supposed to be doing. I am not that heavily into theme but it does make teaching a heavy game easier. Most importantly though is my personal preference. Games that I like generally present decisions that I feel carry weight for the future of the game. I also prefer games where scoring points is done in multiple ways but that are goals set as part of a strategy. You could make the argument if you have a strategy for this you will score much more points than otherwise and I'm sure you are right but I really dislike making a choice like do I take this thing that is worth 3 points or this thing worth three points. They may be done in different ways but if the outcome is the same I am not excited about my decisions. I'm obviously in the minority about this game but I could not bring myself to play this game again after only a couple of plays.

This game has a lot of dice rolling, but it is very easy to control these dice (with workers and some tiles), kinda removing the randomness of the game.

This game plays smoothly and is interesting all the way through. Significant downtime with four but I still really enjoyed it and wouldn't turn down a 4p. Would like to try with lower player counts too, I think it would be a very good 2p.
'18/01/05: Have played a bot a few times - it's not perfect (one game was close, the other was a walkover) so I think it could do with some work, but it provided more experience at the game and gave me more appreciation for it. I think CoB should be played in a fairly chill, thinky way. Definitely a game that will stick around, and a lot more enjoyable that other Felds I have tried.

Excellent euro pointsalad with nice dice mechanics and multiple paths to victory! We've only had couple of games with 2 players and both times we actually misplayed a bit and noticed it at the end. When you get the hang of it, the turns go by really, really fast.

Slight minus from the oddly coloured tiles and for me the board and the tiles could be a bit bigger actually. Tons of replayability with the different game boards and enough randomization so that each game is totally different. Can't wait to try this with 3-4 players.

Great with 4 players.  A lot of player interaction in terms of collecting available tiles and trying to complete regions before other players.  Plenty of different strategies available to win, none of which seems more victorious than another.  You always have actions available, but they usually are not the perfect/ideal action you want to take.  There will be much analysis paralysis for players who must think through multiple possible options.

The theme is non-existent.  The game feels like you're just rolling dice, picking up and placing tiles, and moving components around.  Good mechanics, but very dry theme.  I dropped my rating because the game lacks an engaging reason to be doing whatever you are doing.

I take a 30-second turn, and I grow increasingly bored while others take 5-minute turns.  Though I did learn in my burgeoning agony that my nails need trimming, the ceiling needs washing, and everyone else in the room is having more fun than I am.

Speaking of praying for a heart attack, I do [i]not[/i] need to play another game where the game's winner is determined by massive endgame swings in VP due to bonus/multiplier tiles. Sure, if I cared about these spoiler tiles I could go for them myself.  But I don't.

So if I see you coming with Burgund I'll be running the opposite direction.  Nothing personal.

My go-to game for taking people a little deeper into board games, and one of my favorite games to pick up whenever it's me and one other. Worker placement without having an overwhelming number of options, and forethought early on can make a huge difference in the end score.

The Castles of Burgundy is quickly becoming one of my favourite games. My wife and I always have a great and enriching time playing this.

At first I was maybe a little put off by the fiddly-ness of the resources and I originally thought that the illustration choices were slightly bland, but the mechanics of this game are so great. Really expertly designed. 

Also I love any game where I get to build a tiny kingdom!

I hold a personal grudge with the past me for not picking this game WAY earlier. It flows so naturally, there's meaningful choices everywhere and while dice are an important part of the game, it doesn't feel like luck is the determining factor (thanks in part to the ease with which dice modifiers are gotten in the form of workers). Together with Oracle, two best Feld games I know.

RATING: 8.5
Many scoring routes make this an interesting game. I am not sure how interactive the game is but that may increase with more plays. It requires some immersion due to the number of tiles with special powers. I find the game quite attractive and well designed other than the score track is too small.

The look and feel of a great Euro, which plays very well for two people when often I find many 2-4 player Euros leave 2 players feeling like there's a lot of room to stretch their arms.  

Castles of Burgundy has no room for arm stretching.  It's every decision makes you feel like you are going to win or lose the game.  When your opponent races ahead of you, a real panic sets in and grips your throat.

This game is fabulous!  I highly recommend it for couples looking for a highly competitive, non-area management board game.

RATING: 7
This is a very popular game, but although I do like it and am usually happy to play it, it's not a favourite. I find the gameplay simplistic and the dependence on luck of the dice slightly irritating.

That's not to say I don't like it! I find it very enjoyable despite these criticisms. It's just a bit overlong for what it is; I prefer games that are either quicker or have more going on. But my wife likes it a lot, so it's a keeper!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.7
Great game. Plays very well with 2 in about an hour, 3 clocking in closer to 90 minutes. They are almost completely different games. There is a lot of variety to it which increases the replay value: when tiles come out, what tiles aren't used, goods distribution, and naturally the die rolls to name a few. Once the game gets going, turns are very quick and the game flows smoothly. Special tiles (knowledge) allow some more complicated strategies to take place and help the people who have them too. One of the best 2-player games I've played as well.

Fiddly, and the rules are hard to explain.  Still, it's a good game.  There are lots of paths to victory, this will appeal to some, but for some this may be a drawback.  I think that's typical for Feld.  Once you get the game down it's pretty smooth.  It's also pretty easy, just that the rules take a while to explain.

Very streamlined game, which is quite easy to learn but has more going on then first meets the eye. Very good manual and guidelines on your playing fields.

Played it a few times now with 2 players and that works very well. Good balance of complexity vs simple gameplay. Both me and my GF really like it.

The artwork doesn't do much for me. Theme isn't realy there too. And using 3 types of green while there are so many colors to pick from could be done better. Also the quality of the components feel quite cheap and vulnerable. Thin cardboard and the estate playing fields are just paper sheets. And not even some plastic bags in the box to keep your components?

Other then that, great game!

RATING: 9
This is one of my favorite games and one that I would never turn down playing. While my BGG stats are low, I've probably played this game more than 100 times when you include its implementation on Boiteajeux.net.

For all intents and purposes, Castles really is a step up from a gateway game but it's that simplicity that I really enjoy. The randomness of the dice and how you mitigate them, the variability of your personal board and how the tiles come out on the main board, working toward combos that net you more turns and more points than your opponents, all while trying to ensure that you can timely thwart what your opponents are doing, makes this a great game.

Yes, the game is lacking in "theme", although I can definitely find it in there, and even though the "points salad" moniker has a negative connotation and people generally like to dump on this game due to its lack of theme and its mechanics first game play, I love this game and think that it's great.

Like Race to the Galaxy, enough time is spent describing unclear iconography that leaves you feeling like you're swimming in too many options that you don't really want to play.

this was better than expected, though a little too Euro for me at the moment, and far longer of a game than advertised.  it simply has too many decisions that must be made during your turn, and that can't be very effectively planned in advance due to the interaction with other players.  That said it was sort of fun, and "pleasant".

This game looks appalling. The downtime in my play was so severe that it has made me very cautious about playing this again, we're talking 20 minutes with no decisions to make multiple times in the game. Despite all that it is a game that resonated with me afterwards, like a good film can and that doesn't happen too often with a board game.

After noticing the way up in the BGG top 250 of this game, we became interested in it. We watched a review, and we became even more interested. We decided to go mad, and order it, without even trying it at the gaming club. Unfortunately, it was sold out, and we would have to wait about a month before it would arrive. That would be somewhere in the middle of January 2012. Well, “it’s a pitty, but we’ll live”, we said to each-other. What a big surprise it was, when I unwrapped a present last night, and a copy of this game was inside. I couldn’t wait to start playing. Too bad for me, the alarm clock rang at 5:45 this morning, and I had to leave for work. After coming home this afternoon, I wanted to play it. But first we had some dinner. And then we finally could start the game.

Well, start reading the rules. It seemed to be an pretty easy game. Just like Puerto Rico. Easy to explain, easy to teach, easy to play. And a lot of interesting choices which could be made. And none of them are wrong. A real mind breaker.

A game takes 5 round, each round takes 5 stages. Each stage a player has to roll 2 dice. Then he can do 1 action for each die. Nothing more, nothing less. The actions are.

 - Take a hexagon tile onto the player board
 - Place a hexagon tile on the player board in the kingdom
 - Sell goods
 - Take 2 worker tiles
 - A possible 3rd action, is to buy a black hexagon tile from the center of the game board.

The hexagon tiles consist of 7 different types. Each type has it’s own special advantages. And that’s when an easy game, becomes difficult. Because of the advantages of a tile, there are a lot of possible strategies which can be followed. What is wise to do? If I do this, then I could (maybe) do that, in my next turn. Of course there’s luck involved in the game. The tiles which has to be placed onto the game board, are placed randomly. You have to throw dice. But…. the dice can be controlled by using worker tiles. If you use a worker tile, you can add or distract 1 from a die. And when you build a special kind of hexagon tile, you can even add or subtract 2 from a die. You can change a 6 into a 5 or 1 and then into a 4 or 2. That way, only the 3 is missing and that just by using 1 worker tile. So these guys can become very important. And the luck involved in the game isn’t that big deal anymore.

After 2.5 hours of reading and playing I can only say one thing.

Finally! We’ve found it! This year’s game with the magic spark. This one is just fantastic….

After playing A LOT of other games with similar game-play and mechanics, Suburbia, Catan, Tera Mystica (Gross), and other build a place/ town/ empire games, I have come to truly appreciate this game for it's fairly solid design and replay-ability. Burgundy stood up to more play throughs than any of it's counter parts , even out shining Catan as the better replacement. 
Sure I have personally gotten almost all the play a can out of it, after dozens of plays, but I still find myself longing to play this game when I run into one of the many problems that the games of this rather comfy genre are plagued with, that this game seems to somehow lack.

Pretty dang cool.  Simple rules but tough choices and fun gameplay.  Really like it.

We have owed this game for years and it still regularly hits our table.  A classic!

It is my favorite game from Stefan Feld. The castles of burgundy is well designed and the theme is attractive. 

It is really difficult for me to find a game to play with my wife. But we have played this game nearly 100 plays. That is another reason I give it a high rating.

This game is awesome. It's a very good 1v1 game, though expanding to 3 or 4 players is great too. There's always quite a bit of options, and the dice rolls make it so you can't tunnel and have to diversify while keeping in mind a couple of end goals. I really enjoy the mechanics of this game, especially the dice rolls aspect selecting which tiles you can get for a turn. It's not a perfect 10 because some of the board can get repetitive, but that's a minor complaint.

Reminds me a lot of Le Havre. Slow slow slow and then kind of interesting. Needs a much faster buildup to tension and meaningful interaction.

This will be my only Feld game.  It's fun, and I quite enjoy it, but I'm not very interested in "point salad" games.

En cada turno debes lanzar 2 dados y usar uno para cada acción (conseguir losetas, colocarlas en tu tablero, obtener trabajadores). A medida que desarrollas tu ciudad obtienes habilidades y PV....

Clever game. Works well with 2. Based on random dice rolls, but you always feel you have options, even if you can't ever quite do what you want to.

This is a solid step up from everyone's introduction to board games, Settlers of Catan.

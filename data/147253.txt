2-6-15: Another Ryan Laukat game, another winner. 

9-8-15: Now that I've had a chance to play it a bit... this was the Kickstarter campaign where I discovered Ryan Laukat's games. I went back after the campaign was over and ordered over the next few months: City of Iron, Eight-minute Empire: Legends, and Empires of the Void (plus the print 'n' play expansion). My wife and I love his games and his artwork (one and the same). Having said all that, I think this is by far his best game yet!

(until Above and Below is released later this year... )

Ryan Laukat is a fine fellow and this is a very fine game. Artistically, it is lovely and memorable. It casts a spell over players with its theming and sense of place. The mechanics are very good, but not perfect. But it's lovely just the same and I'd certainly play again.

Fun, tight worker placement game. It's a mish-mash of games that are good on their own, but still works well together. The retiring military is a very nice touch, makes me feel like I'm not wasting any resources. There doesn't seem to be any kind of definite strategy, but I think this is the beauty of The Ancient World, where players MUST adapt to the changes in the board.

A good worker-placement game with a rule-book which really could have used a good developmental edit. Kinda cool how everything is rather costly, which really forces you to choose one strategy and one strategy alone, and then stick with it: trying to change course in mid-game is just too expensive!

The Ancient World was my first introduction to Ryan Laukat's games. I picked it up on a whim (needed a third game for a B2G1 sale), because the art was something I really connected with, it was worker placement, and seemed overall very interesting. My first impressions upon opening the box were not necessarily positive. The player tokens were simple cardboard tokens (with a male and female side), everything else was simple cardboard chits, and the player boards were warped thin paper. But what some components lacked, the main board made up for in every way. It is absolutely gorgeous. Made in a way that shows what the world of The Ancient World is (various terrains and locations, with the ominous titans in the distance), it draws you into the world and makes you want to learn more about it. And as you build districts and buy empire cards, you get glimpses into the differences between the tribes and the kinds of places they find important. As you recruit armies and retire old ones, they pass their knowledge down to the new armies, keeping them cheap to use, but more powerful with each iteration. Lastly, you have the titans, which require specific tactics to defeat, and always strike back, harming you in ways that can be overcome, but never welcomed. As with Laukat's other games, there are multiple paths to victory, whether you focus on getting many empires or defeating the most titans. While lacking a actual story, The Ancient World tells an intriguing tale of people: fighting, surviving, and growing. Each play is another look into their world and each play is worthwhile.

The art was good (all of Ryan Lauket's art designs are fabulous regardless of what game it is) but there was just a lot of fiddliness with this game. The order of the worker placement mattered in conjunction with the number on the worker. The resources were honestly too tight. Plus it never felt like there was the opportunity to get the things done you wanted. I expect worker placement games to be tight but with this is just seems there is too much you need to do in order to get ahead but never the opportunity to do them. When we backed this on Kickstarter it didn't seem like this was the case in the overview for the campaign. Not sure if the rules changed with the finished product or if we were just reading into it wrong. But it was a pass for us.

The Ancient World is a worker placement and "tribe" building game. Over six rounds you nurture your citizens, build armies, and defeat Titans. VP's are scored by which player collects the most tribe banners.

RATING: 9
Ryan Laukat's best game yet, featuring both his stunning artwork and some really smooth, intuitive worker placement and combat mechanics. You're using cards and worker meeples to develop your civilization for both its coin and food generating functions and also military strength to take on some of the lumbering Titans that threaten your place in the setting. Most of the mechanics are old hat if you've got experience within the action selection genre, but it still feels neat and having those battles happen later in the round is such a cool element.

Had my first couple go arounds with this game. It is just fantastic. Great medium worker placement that only takes 45 min to an hour to play. Very little fiddly stuff going on in my opinion and does a great job giving you the tension of, damn there are not enough workers to do everything you want to do. Love the scoring system. Big fan of this one.

There is something missing in this game. Maybe it's a bit fiddly, because the rules on placement for each of the spots is different? Building the cards seemed flat. I don't know. The Secret Cabal review of this game convinced me to get it but playing it just didn't pan out the way I imagined.

I didn't expect much going in on this game, but was pleasantly surprised by it's simplicity to depth ratio. There is nothing incredibly innovative or revolutionary about the game, but what it does it does well.

The artwork is wonderful and draws you in and the gameplay keeps you interested. It's on the lighter side of Euros that can be played with non gamers. The Ancient World is fun and engaging and part of it's appeal is that it plays very quickly leaving you hungry for a little more. Another winner by Ryan Laukat!

Played with 4 people.  Enjoyed immensely.  I found no 'mean' in this game that others feel though with only 2 players, maybe so. (But any 2 player game can feel 'mean') Tons of choices abound during your turn. First player marker moves around and can be taken so I'm not sure why people feel that there opponent(s) can 'block them out constantly'. Sure, maybe a building gets purchased that you wanted or something like that but that sort of thing happens in many games. You just adjust your strategy as tons of choices keep coming out.  Absolute feast for the eyes. A table full of Ryan Laukat's art is a wonderful thing.

This is a typical worker placement from Red Raven Games and offers lots of nice choices and good ways to chain powers and play to their strengths.  The skill numbers for the workers limiting placement is a nice touch and some options being out of bounds the first two rounds also helps give the game a progression.  I would recommend for worker placement fans.

A good old-fashioned worker placement game. There is nothing original or innovative here (you might even think it was designed a few years ago), but the game is just plain fun. Mechanics are very simple, turns are smooth, gameplay is casual but can occasionally get very tense as players race to get building, unit, or titan cards. 

The two-player game is VERY relaxed, with hardly any blocking (and sometimes little competition at all), but it still works well, as one player might go for points through buildings and the other player for military points. The game is probably better with more than two.

After a second play I like how quickly the game can cruise once we remembered the rules (although at the end we found out I crazy cheated for the whole game with retiring military)  I do however feel like the game feels a bit limited in its options.  I think the others I play with enjoy the lightness of the game, and its relative speed means this will surely hit the table again.

RATING: 9
A fantastic civ building title, with the collection of different tribes to amass points evoking a similar feel to Abyss. The addition of threatening Titans, ranked workers for placement, and wonderful artwork really elevate the game into something special. The combat element is extremely simple... and this passivity, where they are more a puzzle to acquire a variety of tribe types than active obstacle, is the game's only real shortcoming, but this will hopefully be addressed in a rumored expansion.  I do ignore the rule that - on the final round, all damaged buildings are repaired in preparation for scoring - no, they stay ruined (and this is a curious addition, and I am not sure why it was included - but it is easy enough to ignore). What this simplification does impart the game, though, is a speedy playtime - much more so than its peers. 

Highly recommended - as are all three of the mini-expansion tiles.

It is a good game, but not a great one. The goal of the game is a very "meh" set collecting system that weaves itself into the varied card rewards. The game is busier than it needs to be. Gathering different resources (gold, scrolls, army symbols) is fine, but having to increase card holding capacity was not adding to the experience. Some of the actions on the board have limited use in the short time frame of the game (such as gaining an extra worker available on turns 3-6, when it is only available on the following turn, is a waste on turn 6, a wash on turn 5, but very helpful to the two lucky players to get it on turn 3/4).

Közepes játékidejű, tablóépítős, munkáslehelyezős játék.

[b]Történet[/b]
A játékban ősi, elfeledett világok városait irányítjuk. Bővítjük a városunkat, a hadseregünket és ami a legfontosabb, megpróbáljuk felvenni a harcot a minket fenyegető titánokkal.

[b]Külsőségek[/b]
Szép doboz, szép rajzok, jó (de nem extrém jó) minőségű komponensek. Nem annyira tetszet az, hogy a munkások csak lapkák, viszont nagyon tetszettek a titánok rajzai.

[b]Játékmenet tömören[/b]
A játék 6 körből áll. Minden körben 3-5 munkást helyezünk le akcióhelyekre. Az akciókkal pénzt és ősi tekercseket szerezhetünk, mint nyersanyag, illetve bővíthetjük a városunkat új területekkel, bővíthetjük a hadseregünket valamint megpróbálhatunk Titánokat legyőzni.
A titánokat, a hadsereget és a városbővítést is kártyák reprezentálják, amiket magunk előtt gyűjtünk. Mindhárom típusnak van valamilyen aktív/passzív tulajdonsága (pénzt termel, spéci akcióhelyet ad stb.), illetve mindegyiknek van egy színe. Ez a szín a 5 törzset jelképez és csak ez adja a játék pontozását. Azonos színből kell minél nagyobb szetteket gyűjteni.
A két legérdekesebb dolog a hadsereg kezelése és természetesen a titánok elleni küzdelem. A hadi kártyák valamennyi közelharci/távolsági haderőt adnak, a titánokon pedig fel van tüntetve, hogy miből mennyi kell a legyőzésükhöz. A hadseregek csatába küldéséhez aktiválni kell őket pénzzel. Igen ám, de érthető módon nem szívesen mennek ezek a szerencsétlenek többször is csatába, így egyre több pénzbe kerül aktiválni ugyanazt a sereget. Node van egy kerülőút: "nyugdíjazhatod őket". Amikor felveszel egy ú sereget, akkor azt egy régire teheted. Ilyenkor a régi sereg lefordul, és valamivel gyengébb képességekkel, de hozzácsapódik az újhoz. Szóval egy aktiválással már kb. másfél seregnyi erőt tudsz aktiválni, ráadásul a lefordítás pillanatában az aktiválási költségek is újra indulnak egyről, hiszen friss hús megy a csatába.
A csatához csak a célszámoknak kell meglennie, de utána van egy kis dobókockázás arra, hogy megállapítsuk milyen veszteségeket szenvedtünk el. Ettől nem kell félni, ez inkább csak egy ici-pici esély arra, hogy ne szívj nagyot, csak közepeset, szóval nem sorsdöntő.

[b]Vélemény[/b]
Hangulatos játék, 60 perc körül lejátszható, de eszement újdonságot nem tartalmaz. Szépek a grafikák, izgalmas dolog titánokra vadászni, és közben várost építgetni. Viszont elég korlátozottak az a lehetőségek, nincs túl sok reális opciód a lépéseknél. Ketten játszottunk csak, de szerintem a korlátozottság több fővel már frusztráló is lehet. Ennek oka, hogy a munkáslehelyezésre is van egy kicsit spéci mechanizmus. A legtöbb helyre, ha foglalt, akkor már csak erősebb munkást tehetsz. Illetve vannak helyek, ahová csak ugyanolyan értékűt, mint ami már ott van, különben büntit kell fizetni. Ez két fővel még nem volt akkora érvágás, de négyesben én félnék tőle. :)
Szóval igazából két csavar van a játékban, amiből a nyugdíjazós seregkezelés nagyon tetszett, de a munkáslehelyezés korlátozásával kapcsolatban vannak fenntartásaim.

Nálam egy játék után 6.9, ajánlom mindenkinek, aki szereti a hangulatos tablóépítős játékokat.

The Ancient World is the fourth game of Ryan Laukat that I've played. Honestly, I think his strength is creating interesting, quick playing games that feel inspired and use well-loved mechanics in a pleasant way. In this, I think Eight-Minute Empire is best. If you told me that EME was originally supposed to be a large board game that plays in 90 minutes, I'd say that would have been a misstep. This, so far, is how I feel more or less about all of Laukat's other games that I have played- Ancient World in particular. There's just not enough in these larger games of his that make them feel as engaging as they should be. There are some nice ideas with worker placement and card play, but in the face of other games of this size and length, it falls utterly redundant. I hope that he concentrates on smaller box games in the future or at least tries to build a little more meat on his larger box affairs. To summarize, Ancient World has a cool theme, beautiful artwork, easy-going gameplay, and some good ideas, but I came off it feeling there was really no replay value whatsoever after my first game of it.

Eye catching art for the game. Interesting military bonus/retiring mechanic. Does not really feel like a civ game, but more of an ancient fantasy/mythology worker placement game in the Mediterranean area. I suspect folks are interested in this primarily due to the beautiful artwork on the main game board. Game play is a bit bland after awhile. I prefer City of Iron (but only by the width of a hair). Too many other worker placement games  are more deserving of play.

A light-medium worker placement game that I found quite unique in its execution and theme. 

I enjoy its flow and the multiple paths to victory this game offers. It borrows some ideas from Ryan Laukat's City of Iron that I enjoy immensely (tableau building, having to manage your civ and military) but since this title is more streamlined and simpler to explain I see it hitting the table more. Every game that I've played have been tight races often won by an inch.

I enjoy that the worker mechanic switches focus from just taking a spot and blocking everybody to using them in a smart way to make other player's actions more costly instead.

About as much fun as Islebound or City Of Iron, only in a shorter time. So I should like it more. But I... don't? Those games felt as if there were probably interesting strategic alleys to run down during the extra hour of playtime, and if I played again I might enjoy doing that. This just was what it was.

And yet... the raw tableau building, combined with pretty harsh set collection, forced fun decisions. I should probably try it again. But will I?

RATING: 7.5
Pleasant game with familiar worker placement mechanics and an interesting theme. Scoring is a straightforward set collecting of colored banners, which come in empire cards that you build and titans that you defeat. This doesn't work so well, because the point variance is too small to give proper incentive to increase sets. There are other rough edges in the overall balance, especially with some  almost useless actions, but there is nothing too wrong with the gameplay. And killing titans is fun! My biggest complaint is the poorly thought graphic design of the cards, which prevents proper overlapping and makes them occupy a lot of table space. The art is a little crude, but since this is a self-production and the designer doubles as the artist, I'm willing to cut him some slack.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fine game, but it runs fast. Since the building cards won't stay for the next turn, you don't have any time to waste if you want a specific one.

Overall it felt like a more complex game got completely stripped down to a minimal one. You can't do much of the stuff you encounter except for the military and titans.

In the end it's all about set collection to get points, while the game has deeper roots that don't have any chance to come through.

RATING: 5
Ryan is a fantastic game artist.  And just an okay game designer.  This game works, and it is marginally fun.  But there is so little here that is actually interesting enough to overcome the tired main mechanics.  There are actually some nice ideas, like the way retired military units provide benefits to their replacements.  But there just wasn't enough interesting stuff to do overall.  Actions and scoring are both very clunky.  God damn is it pretty though.

A nice game, that plays pleasantly smooth. The rule set is gateway-level, but the 7-round set collections still allows for some good strategies to evolve. Theme, iconography, and the set-collection aspect remind me of 7 Wonders – this one is a "fuller game" though. Want to play again.

It's ok. I kinda feel that it stopped just as I was getting into it - a bit more ramp up would have been fun.

It would be nice to see the low level war cards clear automatically at the B cards as their existence slows the game.

Also I wish I'd known the card distributions (maybe via a crib sheet?) food was much scarcer than I was anticipating and this caused me big problems.

Other than that it has some neat mechanics but nothing revolutionary

Pretty decent worker placement. I like the mechanic of workers having a "weight." One a three is on a space a 1 or a two cannot go there. The scoring is pretty cool because it's basically just a set collection. I haven't seen WP and SC mixed like this before. Overall, however, there was just a lack of excitement and forward motion to the game.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (September 2015)

Much better than expected. I was wary of playing The Ancient World because I don’t enjoy the 8 Minute Empire series of games, however this game is better in every regard.

The art is very good and very reminiscent of said games, the rules are pretty easy to learn and teach and the gameplay flows quickly.

The Ancient World is a worker placement game and it has some interesting decisions (should I increase my building capacity, should I buy new empire buildings, should I increase my military, should I get scrolls, should I get another worker? Should I defeat a Titan?) and they aren’t obvious. It is also a set collection game in the same vein that 8 Minute Empire but with much more meatier decisions.

There is some luck with the dice when you defeat a Titan but there are a lot more luck with the cards (and this bothers me a bit). The cards are very important and there are only one of each so the game has a great tactical nature (you can also plan a lot, so there is strategy as well). Sometimes some very powerful cards will give VPs based on the flags you have and these cards tipically only befenit the player who has the most flags of that color, that means most players won´t buy them because the card isn´t very good for them. This bothers me because it is luck if the card appears or not. I realize you can mitigate this a bit by exploring.  

The playtime is a bit long for a game of this weight.

Bottom line, it is an ok set collection/worker placement game. It works as intended but it doesn’t feature anything really exciting for me, the battle with the Titans seems to be lacking in this regard. I would play again if requested but I don’t think I will buy it. I like my worker placement games to be way meatier.

Well designed set collection / worker placement eurogame. The mechanisms mesh well together and the treatment of armies is especially neat. Great artwork too.

It's pretty short (a good thing as it definitely doesn't outstay its welcome) but with only having six turns rolling lucky when fighting the Titans can be quite an advantage.

Gorgeously illustrated worker placement game that grafts bits of Dominion, Ascension, tableau-building, and set-collection together.  The actions feel familiar, as do the powers of the cards, but it's helpful to have a thorough knowledge of what cards are in the deck to assess synergies.  Turn order can be punishing because some cards are essential to progressing your engine (those which provide knowledge, for example), but they show up randomly at the beginning of a turn and aren't replenished until the next turn, and it's costly to seize turn order.  Overall, familiar but pretty fun.

Perhaps there will be an Ancient World: Legends which will replace the boring set collection with something more compelling. The points earned per item is also pretty flat so it seems the game really just about earning the most banners, although there are some bonus point empire cards which give you more incentive to focus. Retiring military was cool and interesting. The worker placement was nothing special but functional. There are some decision points but nothing too taxing.

--------------------------------------------------------

Read rules Sept 2014

This is a worker placement game from Ryan Laukat who I know from the 8 Minute Empire series. Like in those games (and especially Eight-Minute Empire: Legends) the art is beautiful and engaging. Also similar is an aspect of set collection to earn VPs but the similarities end there.

Ancient World is a worker placement game which has you feeding your workers at the end of each round. Although built on this rather ubiquitous framework it offers several mechanical tweaks which seem very promising after reading the rules. There are three currencies in the game, coins, food, and knowledge. The coin economy, and in particular the decisions resulting from its management, seems very clever.

Coins are primarily used to pay your armies to attack Titans who are rampaging across the beautifully illustrated landscape. Each activation of a military unit costs one coin more than the sum of coins already spent to activate that unit during the game. Clearly there's a problem since that cost grows exponentially (the nth army activation costs 2^(n-1), ouch!). The solution is that you can retire these units when you hire new units, they flip over and provide a legacy bonus by attaching to the new unit. The coins clear off of them and the new unit starts fresh with a 1-coin cost to activate. It's painfully clear that you must hire new units eventually but exactly how many activations you should pay for before hiring new units seems like an interesting decision. I don't think you would pay 8 often, but you may have to think carefully about paying 4. Hopefully different strategies emerge, resulting in people playing this aspect of the game differently. The coin starved may need fresh recruits more often, which seems great, except you spend precious actions and resources getting them.

The game looks solid at the very least, and pretty simple to explain given the depth so this will certainly be on my list of games to play.

RATING: 5
I was drawn in by the worker placement mechanic but the rest of the game completely fell flat. I don't enjoy games where the objectives are cards that come out randomly and if you don't get lucky and see a card you want as a goal, then you can't do much. 

I'd like to see the worker placement mechanic reimplemented in another game.

RATING: N/A
Sasquatch 2014 "Neutral". Love the art and designer pedigree, but overall a disappointing game. It ends up mostly being about who collects the most banners (as pointed out by JonBen). I liked the way the retired military techs contributed to future military, but specializing in the melee vs the ranged units felt like wasted effort since there seemed to be a decent distribution of cards that required one type of military tech vs the other vs mixed so it was mostly down to which 3 random titans were available to fight on your turn. Perhaps knowing which ones were coming up next would have improved some of the tactical decisions related to this. I won't seek out playing this game again, but will give it a second shot if somebody asks me to play

Another interesting Euro, this one with worker-placement and some dice-rolling. Unfortunately, the card draw can lead to a scarcity of resources which, while interesting, can also lead to a lucky break for the starting player.

One of my grail games.
The game is excellent, plays fast and looks great. It offers some twists on worker placement. There's lots of replayability thanks to each half of the game working with a seperate deck. There might be slightly too few titans... but then again this does make it more important to time your military stuff better and not just go like "oh well I have no workers left so... guess I'll attack a one-star?".

The presentation certainly earned it more points...
Due to some action spaces being more or less useful depending on the strategy you're pursuing that specific game, some spaces tend to be under-appreciated. Also, there are some promo tiles/action spaces out there. I don't like most of them but hey, optional stuff to alter gameplay is always fun.

Really good worker placement game. It tends to also feel pretty nice and breezy despite definitely being on the medium spectrum.

Also, alternate win conditions are fun. Yes, you're still just racing for VP but how you get them is quite refreshing.

Oh, one downside though. Everyone has a player board. Said board is super flimsy.

First play through - 4 player game. Rules and rule book were overly confusing. We kept tripping over pieces that were not intuitive. Things like "Here's a special rule that overrides these other rules" - but wasn't clear from the board or iconography. Maybe a player aid of some sort would help.

The game is beautiful and once we (finally) got most of the rules worked out was fun. We'll try it at least once more and the score might go up a bit.

A fine worker placement/set collecting game. I knew nothing about the game when I picked it up but I loved the theme so much that I bought it on a whim (something I NEVER do). Unfortunately, the theme did not come through well and instead of protecting my village from giant monsters, I spent more time just trying to get money for military to send them over to the desert (where the giants were simply minding their own business, might I add). The art is splendid, though!

Mixes different kind of well known mechanisms, but didn't impress me that much: the biggest flaws are the playing time (it isn't 60 mins with 4 players, which it should be compared to what you "get" from it) and all the little cards and symbols which is a huge mess and gets more mess when people are hoarding more cards and stuff. Otherwise some interesting ideas (how the military gets more expensive) and I really liked the graphic style. Components, especially cards are such a crappy material AND it would have been better to use some tracks where to follow food, military strength etc. than trying to get your totals from here and there. Nice try, but I've seen enough.

Hard to find

In The Ancient World, players compete to grow the largest and most influential city-state by managing citizens, treasury, and military and by defeating titans. Players take turns sending citizens to take special actions or using military cards to attack titans. One of the actions a citizen can perform is to build Empire cards, which give more citizens, money, and abilities.

Ein weiteres Worker-Placement Spiel.
In diesem Spiel geht es Thematisch darum, eine Insel vor dem Terror einiger Giganten zu befreien.
Wir setzten unsere Arbeiter ein um neue Gebäude zu erhalten, die Kosten Geld und/oder Schriftrollen, die man wiederrum auf anderen Einsatzfeldern erhalten kann. Ein weiteres Arbeitereinsetzfeld ist die Anheuerung von neuen Soldaten, wobei man dann immer eine bereits bestehende in Rente schicken muss (ein Teil der Fähigkeit der alten Armee erhält dann die neue) und so werden jüngere Armeen immer stärker. Mit diesen Armeen können dann die Titanen angegriffen werden.
Wozu das ganze? Ganz einfach: Auf den Titanen sind Fahnen abgebildet. Am Ende erhält man Punkte jue nachdem wie viele Fahnen einer Farbe ich eingesammelt habe.
Mein Gegner hat fasst nur Häuser gekauft (auf denen auch Fahnen abgebildet sind, und somit völlig an der Spielidee vorbeigespielt.
Das Spiel ist nicht wirklich gut. Durch Würfel, die den Schaden nach einem Kampf bestimmen kann man ganz schön zurückfallen, vor allem weil ein Anderer der nur Häuser kauft nicht das Geld und die Zeit aufbringen muss um seine Armee fit zu halten und auch keine Aufwendung betreiben muss um Kollateralschäden zu reparieren...

I hadn't heard of this game before playing it. It's a civ-lite sort of game where you're improving your empire, increasing your military, growing your population, and battling titans, as you did in those days. I was quite taken by this, as it did a lot of things that were a bit novel and did them pretty well. There's some weird gaminess in the design; your workers are numbered 1-5 and on most spaces there are restrictions on what you can put there. Nevertheless, I liked it and would definitely play again.

Solo game with two "players".

Art is amazing, yet frustrating at the same time. For example,
- why is military on the left of the player board, but the amount of military slots is on the right of the capital city?
- why is capacity on the left side of capital city, but empire card on the right of the player board?
- why do the icons on empire cards not match the capacity icon, especially since empire cards are the o my cards that count towards capacity?
- why do the starting cards have a different back icon, not identifying them as e life cards, which they are?
- why are empire, district, and Titan cards mixed together on the player board, making capacity difficult to compute?
- titan die would be more clear with an Xed out empire symbol instead on monster symbol
- why does the start marker have a hand pictured only when the token cannot be taken? 

As a game, we often found no action worth doing partly because of the heavy blocking in the game. For example, cosider a game where the green player has a 2 skill worker, a 3 skill worker, one coin. Knowledge is blocked by a 3 skill worker. Titans require only swords, which green doesn't have enough of. All empire cards are too expensive or require a knowledge. All military require a knowledge. Basically, green had two turns with nothing to do. She went exploring, but didn't find any cards she could afford.

Other bizarreness...
- at the end of the game, all cards are automatically repaired, therefore I never used the repair action on the board
- some of the round end actions do not happen on the last round
- decks have different rules: the empire deck is completely refreshed at the end of each round, the military cards are refilled at the end of a round, Titan cards are replaced immediately, district cards are replaced immediately

Too bad because I like worker placement games and the art is amazing.

RATING: 8
The look and feel of this game is just wonderful to me. I look at the box, then when I take everything out, the theme continues. Ryan is a great artist, that's for sure.

As for the game? It's a solid worker placement with a nice twist to semi-restrict your placements. The restrictions force you to play in different ways rather than just be left out of certain actions. Almost everything is useful, and because of that, it's easy to forget your main objective: collecting banners. 

The game is so tight, and it feels like there's never enough time to do what you want, and that is the sweet spot for a game like this. Too much freedom and you have a hollow experience. So far everyone has wanted to play again and again.

Very cool game. Worker placement with the classic "difficult decision." Do I put out my best worker to guarantee my spot but do less this turn or do I try to use my weaker workers to get more actions? The end goal is simple which makes the game flow easily from turn to turn and it is ALMOST too short. I think 7 rounds would be perfect and I might house rule that in future games. Beautiful game with some very solid gameplay!

The art is gorgeous, but the game is a tad bit too simple for my tastes. With that said, the game is fun since you're building a couple of little engines (money, food, army, etc) plus expanding your city.  I just see it having limited longevity for me - maybe 10 plays before I'd be bored with it.

Reminds me a little of Lords of Waterdeep - needing to be the most efficient player to win.

Very good worker placement game that adds city building, deterministic combat and set collection to the formula. The militia experience system is particularly interesting, where veteran units cost more to activate and can be retired to add their experience to new units. The game flows smoothly, is intuitive to pick up for new players, and offers enough strategic depth and player interaction to keep more experienced gamers engaged.

The whole package is thrown together with Ryan Laukat's signature art style, creating a beautiful game that looks great on the table.

Interesting and interactive worker-placement game. Unfortunately it really needs the extra promo tiles to work well, hopefully they'll be included in a reprint.

Also those buildings at the top left corner are really unbalanced and not enjoyable. You always need them and they are so swingy in terms of the bonus powers the give you.

Absolutely love the artwork and the creativity of the titans. I also enjoyed that you never feel overwhelmed with too many options. 
However, there are worker placement that I enjoy much more than this. I played with four people and during the last round we all finished rather quickly because we had too few goals to achieve and blocked each other from accomplishing them.

Lots of fun with killing large monsters and gaining points by aiding prizes.  I like the designer's artwork which makes it easy on the eyes.  We played with 3 players and it was not hard to achieve some of what you wanted.  Probably more brutal with more players.  Not a game that I would go to play all the time but I will definitely say yes to playing it again.

In general, I liked this one a good bit.  Some novelty with the numbered workers.  Fairly tight on total actions, so you have to be very conscious of where you are spending them.  I like the military legacy system, but found the number of cards that let you expand your military to be very limited. I do wish there was a bit more options for scoring than just the set collection (and the handful of bonus cards).  Still, puts a rich game experience around set collection.

I'll always hold The Ancient World in high regard for getting me to take another look at Ryan Laukat's designs, but it fizzled out a little quickly for me. This is yet another game of his where you are building buildings to try to come up with some kind of engine or going a more combat-oriented route. I vastly prefer City of Iron, which is very similar to this, though The Ancient World is more streamlined and easier to get into. Ancient World utilizes worker placement, while City of Iron utilizes deck-building, but otherwise they are almost the same game. Depending on which mechanism you prefer will probably dictate which game you prefer as well. Both games are good, but this one doesn't have quite as much depth in comparison.

In this worker placement game, players can build armies, collect empire cards or defeat titans. Your workers have numbers on them, and some places on the board you can deny to other people if you have a high number. It's a set collection game, where cards and titans of the same color reward you with more VPs. Armies can be retired to give you a lasting benefit when you attack titans.

It's a fast paced playing game, and reasonably fun. I'm a bit worried that the only way to play successfully is to buld armies and go after the titans. Going after empire cards is a slower way to generate VPs.

My personal gateway game. I think the numbered workers are cool, as well as old generations of soldiers passing down knowledge to the new generations of military.

Not the best worker placement, but it certainly has a place in my heart.

RATING: 7.5
Surprisingly good, tight and short for 4 players.
I would say it is one of the best gateway worker placement games out there (I like Lords of Waterdeep more)
Love:
- tightness for 4 players, the spaces available feel right for 4 players.
- enough empire cards and district cards to guarantee replay-ability.
- fun/length ratio really good.
- easy to grasp.
Meh:
- Titans of 3rd tier should give endgame score special bonus or powers. Missed opportunity for me, overall the titans aren't enough interesting, varied.

Ancient World might become the best Ryan Laukat game in my books. It's a pretty barebones worker placement but I think it's that straightforwardness that makes the game shine. I give this an initial rating of 8, although I need to play this more to see if Ancient World has any legs in the long run.

After first play through I really like this game so far. Its very elegant in design and streamlined. The scoring of banners is beautifully done, it avoids the point salad problem of typical Euro games. The retirement of existing military units is a highly clever mechanic. I think it strikes the right balance between being strategic and deep, but not cumbersome or fiddly. Not to mention the artwork is some of my absolute favorite. Honestly would by a wall print of some of these paintings.

RATING: 4
10 for looks, 5 for gameplay. Art is amazing. Too bad this a very simple gateway worker placement game. There are far better games in this genre. Too easy to do what you want, blocking is almost non existent (2 player) and the three main areas have exceptions so anyone can go there. Too much money each turn. We were always able to buy what we wanted. Too many cards end up in your play area and it becomes a table hog and hard to keep track of all your bonuses and abilities. The titan battles are unexciting. We never bothered going for the 3 pile. It was far easier to just keep buying empire cards to get banners. Most of the action spaces never got used because most of the cards you buy had those abilities, and more. Rulebook could also be clearer and better organized. 

It plays short, but it's just blah. Even waterdeep is far better. Could be good for the age 8-10 crowd. After playing Bora Bora, which my wife loved, (because of all the tough decisions) this was a huge letdown. There were two decisions: buy empire cards, or fight Titans. Neither was exciting. I think Ryan is a great artist, but he needs someone else to design his games.

Based on one play: An original worker placement with simple rules that can be explained quite fast but that once played leads to interesting play mechanics. You have to build armies, feed them, build monuments and attack monsters but everything is interrelated and others can block you ont he board. It is not easy to plan out so make sure to keep a few options open while also keeping tabs on your opponents. There are not too many things to keep track of so you can watch your opponents and ensure to make their life difficult.

Decent worker placement game. You are able to mess with the other players a bit more  here than in a lot of similar games (which I consider a good thing). There's quite a few different strategies that one can pursue. This is not a Civ game and it's not historical. It's a fantasy worker placement that's about average for the genre.

Cleverly designed worker placement game. Played with four people who immediatly wanted to play again. 90 minutes is a realistic playing time when you know what you are doing. 
Your workers have a different value. Workers with higher values can block access for other workers. So you always have to consider if you want so spend your more powerful workers early and block access for others or save them for later to keep up more options. Some cards (armies) get more expensive the more often you use them, but can be put to rest. The new armies then inherit some of their features. Sounds complicates but it really isn´t. Great game.

A fine game, but certainly not a great one. Pretty cool that the designer is also the artist (especially since the artwork is pretty good). Plays pretty good with 2 players.

This is Attack on Titan: the board game !! You should watch the anime. 

Amazing thematic, great worker placement. The game is a little bit more on the cut-throat side compared to some other traditional solitary-multiplayer games, but that's what makes this game unique! Worker placement mechanic at his core is a game of blockage anyways, so nothing to be worried about in this amazing game. The rules are simple, but the depth and strategies are profound !! 

The game is pretty tight overall and there's players interaction although indirect. The artwork is amazing and the gameplay is fluid !! Duration is only 60-90 mins, which is great for such a deep game.

That's a another huge hit from Ryan Laukat, a true masterpiece. 

By the way, you should watch the Attack on Titan anime, which is probably where Ryan took his idea from. This game will grow on you even more !!

I went into this game expecting an okay worker placement game and felt after completing the game that I came away with a better experience than anticipated. There truly are multiple paths to victory that might not even involve taking down the creatures but concentrating on making your town the best it can be. The blend of worker placement, combat, and set collection made for a distinct game. While I am not going to actively seek to play it all the time. A game that can be enjoyed every so often.

I enjoyed this game a lot. It seemed to me to be the gamer's version of 7 Wonders. Overall, it was fairly simple. Gold and scrolls to buy things. Make sure you have enough food to feed your workers. Improve your military to defeat Titans. 

What was really refreshing for me was the fact that obtaining banners is the ONLY way to get points. Very simple to grasp. And there are only two ways to get banners: defeat Titans and expand your empire.

I'd love this to play 5, but it seems like even with four players the available spaces to play would become very limited due to the placement rules. I'm looking forward to playing this one again sometime.

You're building a war engine, you're collecting sets, you're staring at beautiful art the whole time. Ryan has done it again. creating a smooth playing, easy teaching game that I can get to the table A TON because most people I show it to (family and friends, gamers and non gamers) love. Is this a brain melting super in depth game? No. Is it fun and quick to play and can I get it to the table frequently? Yes. I am a huge fan of Ryan and what he does I will continue to send him my money in exchange for beautiful well thought out products. 

A few things I love after only one play. The military system! I love that the prior retired military pass on their training to the new military units making them stronger. By the end of the game you are slaying HUGE titans.

The worker levels. Usually in worker placement (example Lords of Waterdeep) people place their worker then you are out of luck if you wanted to go there. NOT HERE. Because of the worker levels there is a chance you can still get in on the action you wanted it may cost you more money and you cant always get what you want but it makes for some very interesting situations.

I am really looking forward to more plays of this one. I will update if my opinion changes but for now this is the complete package for me. REALLY enjoy it.

The first Laukat game I've played, and boy does it make me want to try his other designs. Ancient World is the first one to really win me over to this style of art. The landscapes/scenery are gorgeous. I really like the more cutthroat blocking worker placement going on here. The fact that I'm fighting awesome looking titans is just gravy on top of solid game mechanics. The card buying/upgrading and set collection is smooth and intuitive. I've never had so much fun collecting silly colored banners.

Exactly what is advertised - a brisk and clean worker-placement game with some nice thematic touches and production values. Just enough blocking to give the game a sense of interaction. The titan battles offer a bit of pushing your luck. Gets a little bogged down end-game with optimization, but nothing serious. 

Not sure there's much depth or variety here. You're collecting sets of banners. That's about it. But it hangs together nicely and will probably hit the table often because it hits a sweet spot in complexity and time.

I didn't think I was going to like this game as much as I have. The game is not hard to play at all. One of the few worker placement games I have played that have risk as a element in the game. If you don't take them from time to time you will not win the game. And that what makes the game fun is taking the risk and trying to plan around the risk you are about to do. I love the arm retire idea and passing down knowledge to the next army you have. This game could and my be rated higher after more plays in my book.

Another great contribution by Ryan Laukat, who's City of Iron set high expectations for this most recent title of his. 

Compared to CoI the worker placement and set collection mechanics of Ancient World will be more familiar to experienced board game players. Overall it is a lighter and faster playing game than CoI, but with the same picturesque art that effectively evokes the game's attractive fantasy themed setting. 

Though not as innovative as CoI, Ancient World should nevertheless find wide appeal amongst strategy gamers of all stripes, perhaps even more so due to the simpler and more familiar terrain that it covers.

RATING: 6
There are some really cool ideas in The Ancient World. In particular, I really like the way that the legacy abilities on the military units work. I kind of wish that the game focused on that a little more. You only have access to one card per player per round, which drastically limits the ability to upgrade your units. 

Unfortunately, there are a few things holding The Ancient World back. The scoring is not particularly engaging, the luck factor is a little higher than I would like, the ability to get knowledge efficiently is a little too important, and the strategy is not as varied or complex as I would like; it's usually a little too easy to rank the value of the available moves. Still, it's a fun game, and it plays pretty quickly.

This is one of our favorite Ryan Laukat games. Scoring is simple enough that the overall goal of the game is easy to teach new players. The use of military cards is smart but challenging.

I want to like this more, but there's not that much to it that is novel or interesting. Overall, it's a set collection game at its heart, and while the action selection mechanism can be interesting (nobody can play at the same location that you're at unless they have someone higher), it actually was flexible enough that I could manage to do what I wanted to do, and didn't feel the serious tension that the other players could really thwart my plans. There just are a lot of other titles in this space that I find to be much more compelling.

The screwy titan mechanic (where players harvest them) just did not work for us. Gameplay seemed somewhat pointless.

The designer sure likes set collection - just wish the game had more depth to it.

No desire to play again.

An interesting worker placement game. It's a touch too complicated to be Calle a gateway game, but it's still pretty easy to pick up. The scoring is a little different, but I like it.

tl;dr: solid euro

[person=11854][/person] popped up on my 'designers to watch' list when I first played [thing=123499][/thing] which I still think is a very good game. Other than the name of the designer I knew nothing about this game.
In essence this is a worker placement set collecting game. You're collecting sets of cards with colored banners. The more of a certain color you have at the end of the game, the more points you score.
Everything works great, and the game moves at the nice pace. It doesn't do anything new at all, but it does work as it should and therefore it certainly is worth playing.

Only one play, but I'm not seeing "it" with this game.  The mechanics work fine, but everyone is trying to do exactly the same thing.  Needs more variety.  It does play quickly though and it looks gorgeous.

Artwork that really pleases paired with well-known elements. Predominatly worker placement and set collection spiced with a really novel army system, in which the more often you send an army into battle the more money they demand from you. But you can send the vets into their deserved retirement and the new recruits will still benefit from the vets experience. Nice touch, but apart from that the game doesn't differ from the lot of other worker placement games. And my biggest concern I have with the game is that I don't think it rewards good play. There are too many cards in the state deck and each game too few of them will see the light of play. In this game I won by a larger margin, but in the last round I scouted and found a palace that was worth an additional 4 victory points. My opponent scouted the turn before me and didn't find anything useful for his set. A closer game could have been decided by luck of the draw. In conclusion, this is a solid representative of the worker placement genre that's playable in short time and comes with wonderful artwork

One of my favorite designs from Ryan Laukat. Some ideas from City of Iron, but faster, cleaner, and easier to parse. One of the better worker-placement games I've played.

One play was all I needed to match this game to my expectations and put it in my top 10. 

My FAIR (fun/art/immersion/replayable) review:

Fun - yes, extremely.  The worker placement mechanic mixed with the theme of city-building and defending against massive titans was a tremendous blast.

Art - gorgeous, stunning, brilliant, compelling, imaginiative, etc. I want some of this art hanging on my game-room wall.

Immersive - holy crap, yes.  I had the best time imagining myself in this city-state, attempting to figure out how to develop my culture while preparing for titans.  The only (minor) thematic recommendation I had was for the titans to perhaps attack players through some sort of trigger.  It is possible to play this game and almost never strategize toward the titan (one player never did and still pulled 2nd place).  If these titans were storming the city, then maybe there could be some sort of condition where you MUST prepare to defend yourself.  For me though, that was a very small thing that could be added in an expansion and didn't detract from any of the strategy or immersion.

Replayable - Yes.  There are lots of working parts that make each game strategically different.  I want to play again right this minute.

This is a very nice worker placement game with some nice twists (restrictions on where you can place a worker). The only thing that was not well balanced was that the game is not tight enough with respect to your empire's capacity (buildings). Titans and districts bring a lot of capacity. We played that Districts and Titans do not count against your empire's capacity. Still, a very good game.

I hadn't heard about this game at all, but it's a new game by the same guy who did Eight Minute Empire. The game is absolutely beautiful to look at. The designer is also the artist, and is clearly way too talented.

The game itself is a worker placement game that's incredibly tight on actions. You start the game with three workers, numbered one, two and three. On a turn you either place one of those guys or fight a Titan.

The main way to score points is a set collection scheme. Buildings and Titans will randomly have banners, in one (or more) of five colors, on them. The more banners you get of a particular color, the higher you'll score. It pays to specialize.

Workers can get you money, scrolls (another form of currency), can hire militia (which lets you fight Titans better), build buildings (from a display of what's available this turn), get a temporary military boost until the end of the turn, get a district (which gives you a cool power and provides space to build more buildings), or take start player (which also rebuilds stuff the Titans knock down). Later in the game more spots open up, allowing you to have babies and search the deck of buildings for stuff you want.

There's some funky placement restrictions. Most spaces only allow you to place on them if you use a higher number than the previous people placed there. The spots to build buildings and get militia aren't restricted that way, but force you to pay a coin if you don't match one of the numbers that other players have already used to go to that spot. This makes for some interesting choices.

Militia provide either arrows or daggers, or both. Some Titans require daggers only, so that's the preferable type of weapon. The cost of using militia is interesting. You check how many coins they have on them and pay that much, plus one more, to use them. So the first activation takes a single coin, then two, then three, and then you don't really want to use them again. And you can't use them if they've already been used this turn. You can retire an existing militia by bringing in a new one. You flip the old militia over, which usually shows a dagger or arrow, and put the new unit on top of the old one, which also wipes away any coins. The new unit gets the bonus dagger or arrow from the old unit (which apparently represents the older unit training the new one). Over time you can end up with really powerful units this way.

When you fight a Titan, after you defeat it, you roll a die, or two or three if you fight the harder Titans. For each die there's one chance nothing happens, one chance you lose a coin and four chances that you get a building knocked down. Which can easily be rebuilt later, but might be painful in the interim as many buildings provide an income of money, food (which is needed for you to have access to your workers) or special powers.

I liked the game. It was a fairly straightforward worker placement game with a few novel twists. It's painfully tight on actions... which leads into my one big concern about the game which is how important turn order is.

The start player at the begging of the game will get first shot at getting a great building, if one is out, and has the best chance at snagging a building they can afford to build. So getting first pick is nice. And because it's such a tight game, it's really painful to take start player. The last player on the first round really gets hosed... and probably needs to take start player (although we didn't grok this at the time).

The requirement to use higher numbered units when placing workers also really makes turn order super important. When the baby making spot opens up, the start player will be able to make babies first, and in the following round they'll have a worker that can't be blocked from making another baby... as their four worker will outrank everyone else's highest worker. As you only have five possible workers, this means they'll get all five workers and be able to do more things in the late game, while other people will be struggling even to get another worker.

I did enjoy this a lot and look forward to playing again.

I like Ryan's designs. He has some common elements he recycles and The Ancient World doesn't break that cycle. However, it is a great game that builds in multiple ways while balancing out options in a very satisfactory manner. I love how your armies get more experience and expensive to use. What a great idea in a game!

Like this game, it's quite fast (maybe not enough) with the feeling of a classic worker placement game (the first time I tried this game, I had familiar feeling like The Pillars of The Earth). The worker level seems cutthroat but I guess there's a tactic element in it. I love the simple scoring mechanic in the end game. Simply one of my favorites.

Classic Retake upon the worker placement genre. The twist is in the way you place workers (common and player exclusive actions + battling the titans) and in the way you gather victory points (solely by banners). A player may become consumed by creating the perfect engine and suddenly the game ends and the victory goes to the player with the most banners. Very nice artwork and a nicely streamlined game.

Ancient land by the sea terrorized by titans. A worker placement city builder to expand our city-state, slay titans, and gain influence of the neighboring and distrustful village tribes. Beautful components and a picturesque main board. This game follows the evolution of dude placement games where you can pay extra to take a blocked action. Numbered dudes also adds an interesting mechanic to limit actions with a fair dose of interactive screwage. Clever military mechanic where seasoned units demand higher wages. Ultimately, they must be retired and replaced with new recruits that gain a benefit from passed on military experience. What a great game representation of the real world.

Except for card warping issues this is a very good game. Worker placement as per usual, except the workers have different values. Players can (for the most part) use the same spot but must exceed the current value there.   Idea is to fight monsters, and buy/construct buildings which have flags (its a set collection game) and you are attempting to get the most points.  Very easy to understand. Do not disregard food, space (capacity) or workers as all 3 are needed in order to keep up with other players.  Would play again.

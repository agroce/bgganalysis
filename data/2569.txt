This is an initial rating based on 1 game with 2 players.
We both enjoyed it, but weren't tempted to play again straight away.  It seemed to me that it would be a far more fun game with lots of players.  It was obviously very light.

I rate this game low already, but I'm not likely to ever play this again. So why do I have it? For my girls (when they were a few years younger), to get them into gaming. And you know what? It worked. At least this game introduced them to little wooden cubes.

RATING: 6.1
This games involves in adding corn into different feeds where fowls cards of different colors (similar to the feeds) are played so that the fowls can eat the feed.  However there are foxes who are hidden amongst the fowl to plot to eat up them up before the fowls can even get hold of the corn.

Good points: This is an easy game and players are able to enjoy this game after a maximum of 1/2 hour reading of the rules.

Bad points: There is not much of replayabilty in the game.  After a few rounds, I got bored of the game.  Moreover, towards the end of the game, with less fowls around, there is no way to get the leftover corn in the feeding area.  The game seems to end without a proper ending condition.

RATING: 7.5
Good, light game with 4 or 6 players, best with 5 or 6. Not as much fun with less players as the foxes aren't as useful and there is not as much competition at each location. Better with 3 than with 2 but still not as good as with more. Works well with non-gamers as well as gamers. The double guessing is great. Good with children and adults in the same game.

Definitely a kids game that adults can enjoy.  It is very light and easy to teach, but with just enough planning and thinking to not make it boring.  Plays well with kids of all ages.  Much much better to teach kids to count than the standard fair (Hi-Ho Cherrio, etc).  [GTI Code: AGCL]

This is a very enjoyable little filler game.  I like the decisions and the fact that you have to try and out-think your opponents.  There is a lot of strategy, and I like the options of bargaining or battling for the corn.  Trying to read your opponents mind is always fun, so this one really was a hit for me.

(KIDS) This is one of the best really fast filler games I have played.  It is a great family game and fun for other casual groups as well.  The more players the better, but any session with 4 or more will be good.  I've played the game with kids and adults with great success.  This is a game of simultaneous selection and second guessing your opponents.  It's really well put together for what it is and a great balance between making choices and luck.  I like this one!

My rating is based on one play only, but I can't really see how I can improve this. It is certainly a fun game and my daughter liked it, but in comparison to the other games  I got at the same time (Viva topo and Tier auf Tier) this one pales. Weirdly enough, I guess my main complaint is that it was too easy for me to win. I had to make suboptimal moves all the time so my daughter could win, which I felt was a good move otherwise I would not have her try the game again. It is rather unforgiving for a kids game.

There’s little about Pick Picknic besides playing some cards, trying to get some wooden cubes and occasionally rolling a die: yet it keeps what little it promises and also makes for a pretty entertaining filler whose strong point is the fast and simple way it plays.

By the way, Pick Picknick makes the best use of (the otherwise annoying) wooden cubes I’ve found in a game so far.

I enjoy this but it has not clicked with the rest of the family (hence the rating of 5).  In games we have played with 6 players, they have complained the outcomes are too random.

I agree somewhat, but I don't mind a bit of randomness.  However, I've actually enjoyed my three player games just as much if not more -- playing two cards per turn does give one more control.

Gorgeous game, charming design, but I never really know what is going on during the game. I can make a decision from round to round and I enjoy it, but I feel there's no way to really stay connected to the overall game narrative when I'm in the game (i.e. I have no solid idea of what is happening to anyone in the game but me).

That said, it's easy to teach and fun to play. But I'm never inclined to reach for this one.

RATING: 6
A rock-paper-scissor-based game where the players simultaneously select a location where they hope to either eat the corn that is there with a chicken or eat the chickens that come for the corn with a fox. Contested locations can be settled amicably or through a duel. Since new corn is added after each card, the sites that went uneaten because of lack of interest or chicken fatality will increase in their attractiveness to chickens (and thus foxes as well). Overall a very cute, fast-paced, and boisterous game that is very fun to play but ultimately lacks any true depth. An excellent filler for people wanting to have fun. More compact and, because of the random versus fixed hands, less thinky than Giro Gallopo, but definitely in the same vein. Screwage aplenty in both.

RATING: 6.5
This is a fun children's game.  One of the limiting factors in choosing a game for the youngest children is whether they must be able to recognize numbers.  My son can do that, but has a hard time understanding relative value sometimes.  I appreciate that the cards have both numbers and that the chickens size corresponds to the number.  Its easy for him to see whether his chicken has the advantage in a fight...and he doesn't get frustrated with not recognizing a number.

I haven't played this with adults, yet, but I see no reason it wouldn't work as a light filler with some bluffing. It plays quite quickly.

Pretty fun game. one of those groupthink games. Everyone plays a card (chicken or fox) and if your chicken is alone in a coop, it takes all the grain. If there is more than one chicken, they must either negotiate or fight for the grain. If there is a fox, it eats all the chickens in that coop.

Played very first game with 2 players = it was okay, but still fun.  More players will be much better.  BGG says 4 or 5 is best, but with 3 players you still get to play two cards per turn.  We'll see...
YES!  3-player was fun, but 4-player was SUPER fun!!  5 player, even better!!!

Use poultry cards to eat lots of corn, with kernels ranging in value from 1-3 based on color.  Use fox cards to eat poultry, trying to eat corn in that color yard, scoring points for the value of poultry (cards) eaten.  This game is all about bluffing your opponents and trying to figure out what they play.  Also, there is some opportunity for "card counting", so you can make a good guess as to what can't be played.  Best with 5 or 6.

It's a simple game of bluffing and trying to outguess your opponents - is everyone going to go for purple just because it has the best crop of corn? Maybe, so I'll lay down a fox! Oh wait, everyone put down a fox. Darnit!

Super light and definitely a good option for families. I had fun with it, even if it wasn't my favorite in the Chicken Family series. I wouldn't hesitate to play it again if asked, but it's probably not one I need to own.

Production: Great artwork, nice tiles for fowl pens, and wooden blocks for corn.  The cards are cumbersome to shuffle over and over, which is exacerbated in games with more players.

This has a bit of a rock/paper/scissors feel, as you try to send chickens to get feed, or foxes to get chickens.  Simultaneous selection of cards determines who goes where, and whether the chickens or foxes (or neither!) were successful.  Lighter game, and probably good with the younger crowd.

RATING: 5.8
Game of luck and a tiny bit of strategy. Grains worth 1, 2 or 3 points are distributed over 6 differently coloured areas. The players get a number of cards (6 in a 3 player game), and can play 2 cards each round, after which they draw 2 new cards. The cards can only be played if their colour matches the colour of the grain filled areas. They contain a bird with a specific value, which can be used to obtain the grains (points), or a fox, which can be used to eat the birds, thus obtaining their value worth of points.

Blind bluffing with large groups (where you can't take the time to determine an opponents play style) doesn't "do it" for me. I mostly feel its a bit arbitrary. The multiple fields make it better than Nobody But Us Chickens since it makes it less of an "all or nothing" affair.

You really need as many players as you can muster
for this one because it's fun to collide with the
chickens and foxes to provide the element of
conflict.  This game is a great social/end of night
style game, and is not big for technical strategists.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Of all my kids' games, this one is by far my favorite.  Just the right amount of strategy to keep me and the kids interested.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It'd be rock, paper, chicken, except there's an additional level of luck injected into this chaos by the cards; you may not always get to do what you really want to do.  Plus, losing a chicken to a fox doesn't really hurt that much (gives the fox a lot of points), so there's no sense of "going for it" when you play a chicken on a valuable pile of corn.  This is unlike the similar mechanism at play in Adel Verplichtet, where getting caught trying to steal valuable art can be deliciously painful.  The game is fine and I'd play again, but won't seek it out.

Good children's game, best with 3 players it seems.

RATING: 4
Could be a harmless little bluffing game, but the annoying between-round ritual of putting out the six cubes makes it lose a point.  I can't think of a move efficient way to do it without some kind of fast-food-restaurant cube tube.  Just pull the trigger on each square.  And the shuffling the deck needs to go.  If there were enough cards to go once through the whole game, it would be a lot more tense.  Otherwise you don't have enough information to base your play on, so it becomes a random card flipping contest.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Almost the same game as Razzia, but the theme and presentation is an improvement.  Players play poultry cards in an effort to claim the corn on offer in six chicken coops.  Foxes played eat the poultry cards, otherwise the poultry eat the corn.  Anything eaten is points.  Fast, and fun.

[2 plays] A fun, nifty filler.  Bright, sturdy components, quick to learn and quick to play.  (Just one complaint: the "fleet fowl" card is about as cute and funny as the "green bean" card in Bohnanza--that is, NOT AT ALL unless you measure your age with a single digit.  I'm sick of this.)

So we were playing this, right, and I kept saying, but this is just Razzia, right, it is, you chickens are the gamblers, and those foxes are the police. The only difference is that the foxes take the chickens and not the lolly. Blow me if it isn't a Steffan Dorra game. Er...it is just a tweaked Razzia. I love Razzia, it's ace. Was this tweak necessary?

RATING: 6
A cute children's game or silly diversion for adults.  Stefan Dorra uses the familiar simultaneous card play / bidding system to create a paper-scissors-rock challenge (see Hoity Toity & Big Manitou for comparison).  The end result is a bit chaotic with a feeling that didn't excite me enough to try this again.  It's probably a decent game to play with the kids though!  Grade: C

RATING: 7.5
-- If anyone has a good source of small, appropriately-themed wooden bits in three obvious levels of value, please message me! The cubes are fine, but anymore I want mine to have nicer, more intuitive bits. --

A household favorite. Has gone down well with everyone I know who has tried it, and it's true you can play it from a very young age (though it benefits from printing out a visual aid for the cube values — I uploaded mine to the files section).

Update: This game remains a favorite, not only with the kids but my partner as well. It's fast, easy to learn, portable and fun. It has also been successful at the school game club.

Update 2: It hasn't come out that much lately, though we always had fun with it when it did. It's small-enough that I see myself hanging on to it for a good while longer. I have knocked the rating down a half-point, and I even hesitate to do that. It really is a (light) "real game" that works well with very young children, I'll always have a soft spot for it.

I am not a fan of dice games and the increased corresponding luck, however, I like this game.  The fox adds some strategy.  The chicken that grabs the grain & runs is a cute addition.

Only been playing 2-player games so far but it is quite an enjoyable filler.  Random card draw, but the game rewards those who time it right to play their fowl or fox cards.  Part of the fun involving a bit of bluffing on what card you're going to play.

Update:  The game is certainly more enjoyable with more people but with 2 players it is silll fun.  6 players seem to be one player too many.

Primarily a bluffing game, with a bit of a Fish Eat Fish feel in that regard. It is more luck-driven though, which is why it isn't rated as high. Blind bidding is enough chance in a game without a deck of cards and die rolling as well. However, the thing that I really like about this game is that if multiple people want the same corn, they can barter and haggle over it rather than just rolling the die. That makes it worth playing and even owning. Nice quick game of bluffing and haggling, with a healthy dose of luck thrown in.

[Initial Impression: 7]
A nice little gem of a game by Dorra.  The theme makes it excellent to play with children, but the psychology and out-guessing makes it better to play with adults.  Players have a hand of cards, some representing birds and some foxes, and each card can be played toward 1 farm yard.  Each yard contains corn of varying value.  The birds "eat" the corn and the foxes "eat" the birds, but only if they show up in the same yard.  Players who play cards into the same yard have to negotiate for the spoils, or duke it out through modified die rolls.  The entire game is about trying to determine what yards others are likely to play into, and whether to compete with them or go for a lesser-value yard and hope to arrive there alone.  Remembering which cards have been recently played can help, as players' choices will be limited by the cards in hand.  A quick, yet satisfying, game that requires you to read and react to your fellow players.

First played this on Feb 15th, 2007.  This is a quick game to learn and play.  Perhaps a bit confusing with some of the rules for your first game play.  I played it with two people, however I'm sure it would be more fun with a larger group of people.  You have to guess where your opponent will go along with plan where you want to go, all after choosing two cards of where to go in the yard.

Another kid's game for down the road someday.  It plays pretty well with adults too.

Finally got in a bigger game of this, and it still really shined.  The blind bidding is fun, but the occasional negotiations add just the right amount of spice to the game.

Apr 08: I've had a blast every time I've played it.  That's a great sign for this game.  Of course it's better with a larger group though.  I love feeding "turd birds" to my opponents.

Hmmmm, veeeeery similar to "Nothing but us Chickens" but this has been around longer. Not a bad game, clearly aimed at the family market. It doesn't play well with fewer players, at least not without some modifications.  I often play with just 3-players, we simply eliminate one of the sets of cards and chicken coops which helps increase the conflict level.

Good light game. It can be explained under 5 minutes and the play time is also short. It has some fun decisions to make, but it also have a lot of luck in it (dice and cards), however as the game is so light and quickly I don’t mind.

I like the bluffing and double guessing aspect of the game, the game also has a bit of negotiation :thumbsup:. The game components are ok and the art is cool. A good game to introduce to new gamers and/or family.

When I played, I felt the foxes were overpowered compared to the chickens, I will read the rules to see if this part was explained correctly to me. This is the reason I have not rated the game higher, perhaps the chickens should be worth a lot less.

Hick Hack is too light for my tastes, still it is a good filler and perhaps I will buy it.

I finally played the game again and it was fun. I don’t remember why I thought the foxes were overpowered, perhaps the rule´s explainer made a mistake in my first game. Due to this I’m upgrading its rating. I would play the game from time to time but I won buy it. It is way too light for my current tastes.

Had many games, and also got the non-gaming sister-in-law and parents-in-law in on one. (All Cantonese speakers.) They all enjoyed it and asked for more! Same with folks at work as I was starting up what's become almost regular workplace gaming.
--------------------------------
This seems a light very enjoyable easily taught game. Only had one session (coupla games). You could take it as seriously or chaotically as you like (ie anything from "try to psycho-analyze your opponents" to "draw at random from your hand"). Would probably work for almost any age group.

Had a second session. I thought I was winning but I wasn't. Still feels just as much fun.

This is a neat blind-action game with a lot of theme. I am horrible at blind-bid/simultaneous actions, but had a lot of fun regardless. The only negative comment I have is that the hand limit of 5 cards really hinders your ability to outwit your opponents (or in my case, be outwitted by.) Maybe I should not complain and acknowledge that I need more luck in blind-bid games.

RATING: 8
This is a nice little filler, it's just the right length for what it is.  I'm not sure there is really any control at all, as any type of thought put into card selection (especially concerning the foxes) is totally dependent on the cards the other players have.  There are plenty of times when large piles of corn go uneaten because no one has the right color to play at that particular time.  But it's easy to teach, very involving with little to no downtime.  I've played with teenagers and they instantly caught on and enjoyed it immensely.

Update - January 2012
Now that I've been playing the game with my kids, my opinion of the game has increased.  It's easily grasped and definitely offers meaningful decisions.  One of my sons plays randomly and never wins, which means that the game isn't completely random. :)  Up to an 8.

RATING: 7
A cute and simple game that forces players to make choices based on a combination of card options, optimal returns, and the anticipation of one's opponents' choices.  Because of the incorporation of the latter, the game plays better with more than two people, especially when it comes to playing the foxes, which are really likely to miss in the two-player game.  Great game for kids and adults to play together - the card draws provide sufficient randomization that the adult can't simply out-think the kid, and yet the game is rarely decided by that randomization.  And the whole thing is simple enough to learn that everyone playing will have the game mechanics figured out by the third or fourth corn drop.

Acquired in 2003. Total number of plays = 62. Cute artwork, silly game which can be played as a simple fun filler without much thought, or tactically with card-counting and trying to learn others' tactics. Fun for both kids and adults. I've found it very useful as a gateway game.

Got 15 minutes? Nothing beats a fun, quick kids game for light weeknight play. Usually want to play a second game straight away. Good with any number. Even the 2 or 3 player rules work well, but make for something of a different game. We replaced the Green corn with Red cubes - this makes a world of difference. The cute art is fun; completely unnecessary but helps transport you into [b]Kid World[/b].

In many ways I prefer the 3 player game most because I like playing 2 cards each turn. The 6-card hand isn't bad either.

Even with 3 players this game is fun.
And for people that really want to win, there is actually some thinking to do in that case.

It's a pity that there are just enough grains to complete the game. They are so small and can easily get lost. A few extra grains in the box could have saved the publisher a lot of customer support.

A lot of fun for me and the kids.  Significant luck factor in what cards you have at your disposal at critical junctures.  Also the chaos of trying to second-guess your opponents.

Has been called "Stefan Dorra's 2001 re-theme of his 1992 Razzia" --and some prefer it.
Played this at Gateway/Strategicon September 2005 at the RioGrande demo table.  It was light fun.  A little better than "Nobody Here but Us Chickens."
Played again July 2006 at game night with 6 players, and while amusing and containing nice bits, in the end strikes me both as too chaotic and too random.  Might be better with fewer people, or maybe just isn't my type of game.

How can you not LOVE this game?!? It's a great filler that has been a raging sucess with everyone I've taught it to.  The "Gotcha!" aspect to the game is marvelous.  I'm not much of a Dorra fan, but this game is easily the one that has gotten the "Most Plays Since Purchase" award.

Simple, clever, very quick game. Unfortunately, I find the bluffing isn't as tense as I would have hoped because the foxes are too difficult to use - but are very strong when they hit their target.

This is a decent game to play with kids of differing ages.  I am not thrilled about it, but all the kids think it is very fun from which is nice.  There are not many games which my youngest can play (and have a chance to win)and the older kids also enjoy.

RATING: 3.5
A well produced blind-bidding game for children.  My big problem is that the luck of the draw determines the winner.  If I send a chicken to get some corn and somebody plays the same colour fox then my chicken gets eaten.  If I send a fox to eat the chickens then another player can send a fast chicken causing me to lose points.  Issue is I have no idea what cards the others have.  I already know my colours and numbers so I would need a variant to play again.  Best strategy: draw fox and fast chicken cards.

RATING: 8
A moderately light game where players simultaneously choose chicken cards in an attempt to collect food that's positioned in one of six areas.  Players can also play fox cards, though, in which case the foxes eat the chickens (and get points for doing so).  The game is based largely around trying to predict who will go where, but is fun and light enough that it doesn't bog down with tedious decision making.  I'm definitely up for more games of this one.

Played with five. An interesting game. If you make an obvious play (trying to take a field with a large amount of feed) you run the risk of being eaten by a fox. Didn't really seem like there was that much conflict, since it is possible for people to play into different areas each round.

Sweet, quick little game! Your chickens are so hungry! The fox's are soooo hungry too and they will eat your opponent's chickens. Lay out the chicken feed on each colored mat, play a chicken card to try and eat the feed or play a fox to try to catch and eat a chicken (lip smacking sounds are suggested)! Collect the most points in chicken feed and chickens to win!

RATING: 5
Each of the 6 piles has different value cubes in it. The play is simultaneous revelation, aiming to outguess the others and be the only 1 on a pile so you get them all if you can. Or go for the big pile and haggle, or do a dice duel if you can't agree. Or play a fox to stop everyone getting it. You're limited to the cards you draw so there's a fair bit of luck, making it family friendly. Like all games in the genre, it's kinda fun for a while if you want semi-mindless fluff. This one goes a touch longer than it should though, leaving it in the ok basket for occasional variety but not a (food) staple.

RATING: 6
A lot of luck in this game may keep it from being played more than some other fillers I have.  There's a very simple game here though, with bluffing galore.  The negotiations between poultry was pretty much eschewed by my group, favoring rolling for every battle.  I prefer it this way, as the game keeps moving.  A timely played fox can be the difference between winning and losing in a good competitive game.  Downside is that some players may end up being out of the running about halfway through the game.  If the game took more than 10-15 minutes, this would be an issue.  As it stands, this rating is more likely to go up than down with more plays.

RATING: 6
I really enjoy the buildup of unclaimed corn, then being the sole fowl to nab them. But you feel cheated from the competition if you don&#039;t have the relevant card. So you need more than 4 players to distribute the card types, increase competition (more fun) and to reduce someone running away with the game; because unlike Montgolfiere, things tend not to be equal.(It also makes it difficult to relate to other players&#039;possible hand, and respond to that). The haggling moments may initially be fun but can slow the pace(as with Basari and Lowenherz), as does the corn allocation at the start of each round. With numerous coloured corn of various values makes the tracking of the race very foggy, with no declared winner until the chore of totalling up is over. This would be less arduous with more than 4 players.

Players: 2-6
Time: 20-30 min.

Family game in which there are six chicken coops with various feed values (points) on them. Players simultaneously choose which coop they want to feed from, hoping to get all the corn to themselves. If other players send their chickens to the same pen, you can negotiate to split it, or roll a die for it all. However, players may also play foxes to a pen, in hopes of eating other players chickens for points. Involves some guessing what others will do and bluffing.

RATING: 6.5
This is yet another game with a blind decision component.  Why do I have so many of these if I don't really like the mechanism?  I guess it is because of the psychological aspect of the game.  However, the luck of the draw here seems to have too great an impact on your decisions -- often preventing you from doing many things that would otherwise be to your advantage.  Still, my children enjoy it.  Since they do not play strategically, that is not so much of a problem.  I'm afraid my rating would drop some if I played this with more serious competition.  (6)
--------------------------------
I bumped this one up a notch after playing with the girls again.  Sure it is a light blind-bidding game, but it could be worse.  There definitely seems to be at least a bit more tactically than I thought previously.  I could see this rating increasing a little more if it made it to the table more often.  Now that the girls have a greater interest in it, that will happen.

Great game for playing with kids. It's all about second guessing. I thought I'd have my dughter beaten in this game but no - we probably win 50/50. Sturdy little box of good and useful compnents make this a must have in the cupboard. "Serious" boardgamers would not like the lack of control but I guess they can count cards if they want to.

[2 plays] Ruthie is almost old enough to play this the right way. Up to now we're playing simpler variants that I make up on the spot, which are eventually getting closer to the actual rules. The artwork is fun, components are high quality. Actual game rules look pretty fun and I look forward to a game soon that is played properly.

Most recent play on Thanksgiving 2005 with Dan, Paula, Becky, and Ruthie.

This game is a blast! It is quick and very easy.  Everyone we've played it with has loved it, especially "non-gamers". It's a game where if you think too much about your move you may be feeding yourself to the fox.  Definatly worth having in your stock. Works well with 7 players too.

RATING: 3
Random and Arbitrary, still it is engaging enough for you to care when you are losing.  Kind of cool hand management and bluff.

The problem for me was that victory should be based on how much corn you make, with the foxes to help catch up.  Rather than Foxes just making tons of points, and corn deciding who comes in second place.

UPDATE: Having played this a few times now, I just feel that there are too many better games like this.  Many simultaneous action games give different goals, but this really is all about drawing the right cards (Foxes) and getting lucky eating the high valued chickens.  The corn is inconsequential. Perhaps Chickens should only be worth one point a card? I wouldn't play this again unless a child requested it.

This is a light and fun game, which is lots of fun with five or six.  The best element of it is the psychological game in trying to figure out the groupthink and use it to your advantage.  The only downside is that the hand size is a touch small and limits your choices a bit too much.

RATING: 7
A great game for newbies, and a nice fast filler where blind bidding works.

Board: 6 tiles (chicken coops) of different colors.
Cards: Colors match tiles. Mostly chickens #1-6; one -2/color. Also, numbered foxes. Deal 5 cards/player at start.
Play: 
- Start round by adding 1 random cube to each coop
- Everyone simultaneously reveals 1 card: those animals go the same-colored coop. 
- For each coop:
... 1 fox present: eats all chickens there (add those cards to score pile)
... >1 fox: fight; winner gets all chickens
... 1 chicken: it wins all cubes
... >1 chicken: all remaining either agree to some split, or fight
... the -2 chicken: if with other chickens, it takes ONLY a single green cube (if available) and is then discarded
- Fighting: roll d6, add # on card ... high sum wins; reroll ties
- Draw new card at end of round
- Game ends when cannot add cubes to coops
- Scoring:
... chickens = # on card
... cubes green=1, blue=2, yellow=3

I always liked this game but it didn't spark the interest of my children.  It's fun to play with serious gamers too since it has such wide appeal.  There is a good amount of luck and trying to outguess your opponents, but I generally like those types of games, especially as filler.

[many plays] I am rating this as a kid's game.  It is certainly not a game I would play with my regular group, but as a kid's game it is probably the best one my family has yet.  It has a fun theme and decent amount of strategy and luck.  The kids enjoy it, it is tolerable for adults.  It makes them think, make strategy choices but at the same time plays light and fun enough.  A great theme with chickens, foxes, and chicken poop.  I have played three and four player games usually with two adults and two children (age 5 and 8).  The five year old is the very youngest she could be and still really understand how to play the game.  Really I would say this game is roughly for 6-10 years old.  The five year old needs someone to talk the strategy out loud and keep her focused on the play.  The eight year old has no problems understanding the strategy or keeping his focus on the game.  He is right in the center of the game's target area I would say.

Interesting game. The kids think it is lots of fun. You tend to psych yourself out trying to second guess what other players will do, but it just comes down to what cards are out. Sure if someone has the same color chicken as a big pile of corn they will play it and if they have a fox they will play the fox, but strategy has more to do with whether they have the cards than whether they will play them.

RATING: 6.4
[gameid=2569] is meant to be played with kids in my book. My rating is based on this. The game is a push-your-luck, know your bluff and outsmart the others game.

Chickens in 5 different varieties compete for food, while trying to stay out of the clutches of the wily foxes. Food is distributed randomly and comes in 3 flavours with values of 1, 2 and 3. Obviously the higher flavour is more sought after, but oft lures the fox to the feeding. Perhaps going after the less sought after might be better? If you are alone you can gobble it all up.

If no chickens come to feed, only foxes, they go home with hungry bellies. Otherwise they snack on the chickens. Sometime more than one may attempt to feed (be it chicken or fox) and then they fight it out by throwing a die and adding the value of the card - unless of course the chickens agree to split the food.

There are many aspects to the game and it is a lot of fun for what it aspires to be - a quick game of negotiation and bluffing, even more so with 2-3 players as each gets to place 2 cards.

It might also be fun in a more competitive setting in a party situation - but we have passed it on to my in-laws, to play with the kids.

DS, 5, LOVES this game, we have played it lots already and he does his fair share of winning. He loves playing the fox card!!, prefering to win cards then corn. When Mum and Dad play with him (3 players) then we take out 1 yard and its colour cards. When it's only 2 players we take out two yards and the cards, this works well for DS. And if his attention is short then we place 2 corn down at a time in the yards.

Pick Picknic is a light blind bidding game that just barely escapes mediocrity.

Apparently,  not only is the bidding blind in this game - but the graphic designer was as well.  Unless there is a color shortage that I am unaware of,  choosing blue and green as two of the cube colors was an abysmal decision.  At a distance,  I can't tell them apart.

This game has all of the ingredients that generally elicit positive vibes across the board for me.  Not here,  not now,  not this time.  While the color issue may sound trivial - there is not enough fun on offer here to compensate for the distraction.

Because of the multiple fields,  it may be better than,  say,  Nobody But Us Chickens - but that is hardly a ringing endorsement. 

I am sure this game will click with it's share of people - but for me - instead of basking in the experience of a hazy, lazy day alongside a babbling brook - this picnic more closely resembled one that was quickly overrun by ants.

RATING: 7.2
Quick, light game that plays well with children.  Since everyone's choosing a location without knowing what the other's are doing, it is quite literally a game of chicken.  Cute art, relatively easy rules, can be played by anyone old enough to count.  During my last game, the 6-year-old at the table beat the rest of us (which has its plusses and minuses).

Can be relatively amusing for adults as well, though it doesn't get much play in our group.  I guess it just doesn't have enough frustrating or laughable moments in it to be our late night game of choice when we want something lighter.  If we are in that mood we are more likely to reach for [gameid=29773] or [gameid=32125].

2 plays with 4 players so far, and its good, second guessing fun.  thinking that 6 pens is too much for 4 players (and have read variants to this effect).  also thinking the start of the game is too slow, with one corn per pen. thinking of 1d6 corn/pen to start (Tish's idea).

update: starting with 1d6 grain in each pen works great to speed up the game.  (though the endgame is a bit off, as you can then have an odd number of grain in the last replenishment phase.).  6 pens with 4 players is NOT ideal, though still fun.  not enough interaction.  will try reducing to 4 next time.  or only bringing out with 5 or 6 players.  still really enjoyable.

Simple filler card game by Stefan Dorra. Colored cards with a numerical value are played simultaneously to battle for corn kernels placed in the matching colored spaces. Fox cards add the twist that they eat the actual numbered cards as opposed to the kernels. The silly theme makes it easy to learn the game. Fun game that plays in about 30 minutes and can handle 6 players (plays well with 4-6, less interesting with less). Good with kids and as a gateway filler. I'm also generally a fan of art by Doris Matthaus.

I'm a big fan of simultaneous-reveal games, since it requires that players try to out-think their opponents.  That sort of decision-making adds a lot of angst to a game, which in turn make the decisions more meaningful.  That it's light enough to played with families, can accommodate more players, and still gives you some choices to make during the course of the game, make it a good game for my collection.  There is some luck in the way that you replenish the barnyards, and in drawing cards, but the game doesn't take long to play, and it's good for 20 minutes or so of good laughs.   It's definitely better with more players; with 2, it's too tactical and deterministic.

Excellent family and filler game - my rating reflects the type of game it is. Lots of fun, moves quick, and requires thought of what opponents are going to attempt.

Also, Doris's art is excellent. I love the "Jive Turkeys" and the "Game Hens."

This game would be a lot more fun if it didn't rely on color as the only way to tell some cards apart. The fox cards look the same except for color difference. But for those of us who are red/green color deficient that means the game is a whole lot less fun and even more random. The original version of Ticket To Ride had the same sort of problem. But the newer version has symbols on the cards and board so that color isn't the only way to differentiate things.

The rating is as a child's game..which it is. Adults will find this pretty fun as well. The only big problem with the game is that it's sometimes hard for kids to remember where they played their cards..it may lead to arguments. Still..I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good game for younger kids. Good riddance Candyland!!

Great family game where players try to get the most food at the farm yard.  Players select fowl or fox cards to attempt to eat grain or birds.  Always enjoyable, and a great game for everyone.

german version - hick hack geckelwack - what a great name.

Paper scissors stone with animals - Chickens eat corn, foxes eat chickens, foxes lose points if eat chocken poo.

house rule - don't do the trading [don't like trading any day of the week] or agreement bit - always roll dice to decide who wins the lot.

hidden action selection is such a cool mechanic.

I know that Pick Picknic is meant to be a light-hearted family affair, but it's apparent (and likewise annoying) that the "fleet fowl" cards are severely underpowered and it's too easy for players to get hosed by never being dealt certain colors.

RATING: 6.5
Decent filler, but nothing that really makes me want to play. Bought it for my daughter (3½ at the time), but once I got it, realized it's way too complex for her. Finally at 4½ we're playing the game, seems to be working out all right!

Another light ('filler') game. I didn't do so hot on my first outing of this. This is another game where if life gives you lemons in the initial deal, you will spend about half the game playing those cards while they are worthless with no guarantee they will be of value later.

A nice little card game, easily explained and a nice balance between luck & strategy. I especially like the fact that you can get points by collecting cubes & cards. Also, it's allowed to deal instead of duelling, which provides a nice option for politics.

RATING: 5.5
A player gets 6 cards in his hand. He plays two of them. If he gets the most chicken of a color next to a cage, he collects the grain. If he places a fox next to the cage, he catches the chicken. Three colors of grain, will give the player 1, 2 or 3 points per piece. The caught chicken will give him the points shown on the card. Player with the most points win.

Light, no, ultra-light game. The age of 6+ says, that this will not be a gamers game. And it isn’t at all. This can only be fun, if their are children participating in the game. 90% luck, 10% tactics. Not a game to recommend.

RATING: 5
Fairly chaotic, but pleasant. With the five-card hand of drawn cards, you don't have much control over your fate, as you watch one yard build and build, then people scarf up the corn with their birds, and you can't even so much as send a fox in. I think a variant to add some control would make this an interesting game of feints and bluffs. As is, a decent diversion at best.

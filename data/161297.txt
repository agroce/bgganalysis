Kickstarter-backed. Seems cool after one game, though possibly prone to downtime as players work on their matrixes (AP!). Quite a few moving systems to keep track of, but it's an interesting and colorful puzzle-like game. Ended up selling it because it just wasn't coming out on the table.

The Bejeweled mechanic works very well and is utilized in many interesting ways... now the negatives.

The game takes a very long time and analysis-paralysis is guaranteed.  You get to access the fun part of the game, The Matrix, 12 times over the course of a 2-3 hour game, which is just too sparce.  All in all, there's just too much fiddling, moving parts and downtime to justify the one great mechanic.

Wow! Exactly the kind of Lightweight  to Mid Gateway type game I was looking for. Plays great with 2 or 4. I'm very happy. Loved match 3 games and this is a match 4 game with some strategy  thrown in. It can be a bit luck of draw. As my last turn always seem to not get what i need. Love it. Might rate it higher.....

As I heard of it I had no urge to play that game.
Then one of my best buddies pulled it of his shelf.

Nothing that I want to have myself but for the one game we played it was more fun than I expected. Components are good, the artwork is a matter of personal taste and the gameplay is so so...but somehow I fun playing it.

Paradox is pretty much a set collection game, where you'll score points for collecting various sets of cards. You'll draft cards from a pool of cards, but only get to actually keep the cards by meeting a requirement to keep them via arranging colored discs in a certain way on your own personal game of Candy Crush.

So, you'll be trying to grab cards that best score you points, but also cards that your Candy Crush board is suited to be able to actually complete.

Overall, a mechanically fine game, but nothing that really drew me in, and it felt pretty repetitive by the end.

Played during Geekway 2016.  I really enjoyed many aspects of this game - the "Candy Crush" board that must be played to earn cards within a limited time, all while trying to manage that board in order to collect sets of cards.  Overall, though, there was a little too much to keep track of -- I think if this had been streamlined a bit, I would have enjoyed it more.  I was excited to play at the start, but as time dragged on, just wanted it to end.  Very nice production values - art and wooden discs.

RATING: 6
The card art is awesome.  The main mechanic of the game is a little fiddly.  I wish someone would make an app for this.  

On repeat play I realize its not for me.  Staring at the matrix of disks gives me AP.

Why I got rid of it - Pretty card art and a neat idea do not always add up to a great game

A well-paced, puzzly game that doesn't outstay its welcome, especially at 2p. I got a chance to play a game at Geekway and was very impressed with the smooth gameplay. It's intuitive to learn and will be extremely pretty on the table, assuming everything looks the way it's pictured in the KS. One of my most anticipated KS games of 2015 so far.

I played it at Archon this year, and while I usually hate games that take a while to play, this one kept my interest the entire time. Even with four new players, the mechanics were simple to learn, and there were very few "mistakes" in game play. As for the strategy involved in this game, it isn't simple. There is a lot of complexity, but mistakes can (usually) be corrected if your smart, so you're not trapped by one major mistake at the beginning.

Lovely looking science fiction game which at its heart is an abstract puzzle.

Paradox is a puzzle driven game (Bejeweled) with a set collecting points engine, and interaction thru movement and denial of set options.
There are a lot of variations based on various bonus point conditions, as well as cards which alter the in-game matching patterns.
As much as anything else, it offers a compelling mechanism for building and planning moves, with a certain amount of luck from cards available in the market at any given time, and on discs drawn into the personal player matrices.
Not quite as deterministic as Trajan, or as rich in theme, Paradox offers a rather different board game mechanic which is both interesting and fun.
It was an impulse back for me, but it has proved to be a nice game so far.

(05/08/2016) Comment based on one aborted play.

An interesting "Candy Crush" or "Bejeweled" pattern/matrix mechanism, with a loosely tied science-fiction timeline theme, makes for a light/trivial set collection game.

Game components and game art are very good, with some immersive thematic graphics. Rules are straightforward. Play is quick, if one is able to puzzle through the "Candy Crush" mechanism.

Unfortunately, I did not feel that the central mechanism tied meaningfully into the timeline repair theme; I was simply playing "Candy Crush", collecting resources, allocating them to cards, and banking cards to make sets for end game points. It felt more like playing an abstract, with the trivial "Candy Crush" mechanic being the main feature. There was potential for players to affect each other's scoring, by planning and manipulating the "Quake" marker to fracture specific planets (and thus nulling out associated banked planet cards, which were central to scoring), but this was found to be too opaque to be of deliberate and practical use. There was very little interaction among the four players, somewhat lower than the interaction found in Thurn and Taxis. 

It was alluded to in the rules that optional and expansion rules would build upon this base game, for more complexity, but it was concluded that it would not make the game any more that interesting. With four players, the downtime was frustrating, as each player puzzled through the "Candy Crush" mechanism, while the others aimlessly watched on, leading me to think this would be best at no more than two players.

Our group mainly plays medium to heavy weight board games, and found this design to not offer any challenges or depth. We were bored within a few turns, and decided to abort four turns in. Another Kickstarter design that has good ideas, but stringing together a few novel mechanisms and pasting on a theme does not make for a good or satisfying game. Like many Kickstarter games before it, this could have used more game development from a professional game publisher. I rate this a "2". I will never play this again.

Se trata de un juego abstracto ligero en el que se aúna una mecánica parecida al "candy crush" con una puntuación de tipo set collection

En una galaxia lejana una discontinuidad espacio temporal está destruyendo los planetas existentes. Nosotros como científicos que somos deberemos salvaguardar los planetas, reestableciendo su espacio tiempo. Esta historieta se traduce en que vamos a ir intentando quedarnos con cartas que representan a los 15 planetas. Cada planeta tiene cuatro cartas, de tal manera que al final de la partida 1 carta de un planeta vale un punto, pero las cuatro del mismo planeta valen 10. Pero ojo, no valdrán todas las cartas que consigamos, los planetas que al final de la partida estén destruidos no cuentan. Como nos quedaremos las cartas? Fácil, cada carta precisa de unos recursos que debemos generar realizando columnas o filas de al menos cuatro fichas del mismo color en una matriz de cinco por cinco (candy crush). Para ello podremos hacer hasta dos movimientos de fichas con el mismo símbolo.

Esto lo podemos aderezar con el uso de unas cartas adicionales de puntuación que premian determinados tipos de cartas de planetas, cartas de escenario que modifican el patrón a realizar en la rejilla, en vez de columnas o filas, cuadrados ....

Esta bien para cerrar una sesión, siempre y cuando la gente no se atasque mucho pensando sus movimientos. Atención al arte de las cartas

Match puzzles come to board games in an absolutely boring design. Hardly any conflict or ways to influence your opponents. Grab cards, fiddle with your board in silence, rinse wash repeat for 90 minutes. No thanks.

RATING: 6
There are some good things here, but some parts are a little too luck-driven for the length. The premise is that the players are scientists trying to save as many planets as possible from a rampaging quark by tying together their past, present and future selves. Players draft cards to add to their personal display and then have a varying number of turns to place a varying number of resources on the cards to claim them before they slip off to the discard pile. Players can also use resources to shield planets from the quark or repair damaged planets. The real heart of the game is in how resources are collected. Each player manages their own randomly drawn 5x5 grid of tokens in three shapes and five colors. Every turn, a player can swap two tokens in order to create Candy Crush-like rows to trade in for one or two resources of a matching color that must be immediately used to rescue cards or protect planets. Rescued cards go to a score pile that is counted up at the end of the game. You get the most points for collecting all four cards from a single planet (past, present, future, and nexus).

First the good. The artwork on the cards is creative and fun. Different artists depict different races in their past, present and future forms and each artist brings their own brand of humor, commentary, or pathos to the party. Also, swapping tokens in your matrix to create lines of color is a fun little puzzle every turn to gain resources. The card drafting is okay, but not particularly exciting. You don't have much control, so you need to make the best of what's on offer. It's the planet-destroying quark that seems like it could use a little more design love. The planets are laid out in a circle and every time a card is rescued the quark rotates 1, 3, or 5 planets. When it lands on a planet, that planet is damaged and cards for that planet will not score at the end of the game unless the planet is repaired. It can be that so many planets get damaged that many of your hard-earned cards could be worth nothing. You need white and black resources to fix and protect things, but if you don't draw them for your matrix, there may not be a lot you can do. That's a bit frustrating for a game that takes about 30 minutes a player. It's not a bad game, but there are a lot of other games at this length and weight I think I'd rather play.

I love playing this game. I've played it many times (15-20+) and I never get tired of it. The concept is wonderful, and the somewhat random nature of it keeps things interesting, but not unbalanced. If things ever feel "boring" (I haven't got to that point yet) then there are plenty of things you can switch out or exclude. Matricies, for example, will throw your entire game into an entirely different arena! ;D

I backed it on kickstarter because of its incredible looks. Love all those different art styles and the theme is pretty unique. I'd love me some more interaction though. It feels too solitary for my taste. And it's a little bit too long for what it provides. Therefor I'm willing to trade it.

RATING: 8
FIRST IMPRESSION:

I was fascinated with my first play trying to wrangle my 5x5 grid in a Candy Crush sort of way. I didn't do it well! One collects either 1-2 discs of a color when one forms a 4-5 disc stack in a 5x5 and each time one does, everything drops down in your grid and you refill. The collected resources must be used in that turn to complete cards or protect/open up planets to be scored. Scoring is primarily set collection in a couple different ways. 

Five different scenarios are included which tweak game play in different ways to create a bit of diversity.

Second play saw the rating rise one point to an 8. I still didn't play well, but timed a demolition of a world/removal of the white shield to cause my opponent to lose 10 points allowing me to eke out a 1 point win. I'd recommend playing with the five cardboard shields that basically allow you to store one color disc that if you never use it counts as one point.  

I've only played two player - I could see a multiplayer game potentially dragging a bit if AP is an issue.

I’ve played the game now with 2 players, 4 players, and even in a solo-mode published by the designer on the BoardGameGeek entry for the game. It plays equally well at all of these play counts, and I can’t see any reason why it would play any differently at 3 players. Gameplay is quick, with no unreasonable downtime. Because your Matrix is ready for your next turn as soon as you finish your current turn, you have time to look it over while others are playing in order to find the best moves to make when your next turn comes around. The estimated game time of 20-30 minutes per player seems just about right. Even a 4 player game with 3 people playing for the first time was over in under 2.5 hours.

Designer Brian Suhre should be very proud of this game. It’s innovative, beautiful, it’s got a ton of replayability, and most importantly, it’s a lot of fun! I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys sci-fi themes and puzzle games.

Paradox is a novel game in which the players take on the role of scientists responding to quakes in the space-time continuum that threaten the past, present, and future of civilizations throughout the universe. Players must puzzle out the time strands in order to redirect the quake and repair the damage it has already done. It's a race to save the most civilizations and timelines as the quake trudges on, destroying one culture after another. Dominated by a fascinating mix of card drafting and abstract puzzle play, the theme shines through, nevertheless. The artwork is stellar and gameplay is a blast!

RATING: 6
This is an interesting, puzzily game. On each turn the first thing you do is a 'take cards phase'. Cards are big points if you collect sets of same letter. to get those points you need to clear bits of your grid just like in bejeweled. This is a 5x5 token grid of assorted colors. Each turn you get 2 actions to  swap 2 tokens with matching letters, and they clear when you have 4 of 5 of a color in a row. You swap from your own board, or this ever changing 3 token public pool in the center.

Meanwhile you have this planet track that has planet tokens with letters  matching your cards and a disaster token that rotates. When the disaster lands on a planet it flips to the red side meaning that the cards that match the letter don't score. Two of your colors let you unflip or protect a planet.
So the big question for me is how many of your bad turns boil down to your own efficiency problems vs luck of the draw? Hard to tell. The downtime between turns is long, especially with 4 players.

Sometimes the right cards don't show up. Sometimes when y get the right cards y U won't be able to finish them because you draw the perfect mess of tokens.

The good easily outweighs the mildly inconvenient parts of the game.

Tentative rating after solitaire 2p. The game's rules are very simple to execute, which allows you to focus on scheming to maximize your opportunities. I can't wait to play this with like real humanoids.

Of course, the art completely delights me….

[b]1p[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] It may be pretty tough to get a good score this way, but it's a simple, no-AI way to play Paradox. What's really brutal is all of the world fracturing the cards you leave behind will do; this turns into a very nice puzzle, as you balance taking the cards you want, versus leaving cards [in the right order!!] in the unstable wormhole to fracture planets on which you've banked.

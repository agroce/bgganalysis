RATING: 7
Short incremental-capitalization 18xx with a fixed number of turns.  This is interesting, but it lacks the control over game length that adds much of the strategy to other 18xx games.  When played with sharks, the train rush is not gentle, as companies can very quickly flip shares to the market for cash.

The tile mix is a little odd: small stations upgrade to green switches but not junctions, so early decisions about small stations have large late-game impact.

RATING: 7
+ Excellent components (especially for its family). Thrilling gameplay, and the limited number of turns allows a better notion of how long it takes. Can be pretty smooth with 3 players and brutal with 5.
- Could use some of the extra flavour 18AL has. Limited turns number does limit its flexibility.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Recommended for 2-3 players.  As an introductory game, this plays very well with three.  With more players the board gets much tighter, and I'm not sure that I'd want to play it with 5.  I've played it with 4+ players and you get the potential of trains rusting before they've even run once.  Not necessarily something that I'd like to see in a newbie game.

With 2 experienced players and a novice, we played a 3 player game in 2.5 hours including time to learn the game.

The one aspect to this game is that the trains seem rushed.  In mid-game some of the threes only got one round before they were obsolete, I can't imagine what it would be like with more players.  There is not enough time to loot and dump a company which is one aspect that makes it good for newer players, but the stock market is not moribund as it seems to be in 1861.

There are a couple of player aids built into the board, turn sequences, and phases which are really helpful to new players.

I, the newbie, won by a comfortable margin by getting two good routes going and milking those. In the beginning I had 2 twos, and one three, and the ability to run three routes seemed to position me so solidly that nobody could catch up even as I choked towards the end.

More experienced players are still going to want to gravitate towards heavier 18xx games, but I like this one, and the fact that you can get a game in on a weeknight.

I like all the chages made here. too bad it isn't really that much shorter...

also, as much as I like the changes, the map and the track play is relatively uninteresting, which keeps it off a 10

edit: had a game where basically nothing changed from round 2 to game end. with 3 players, try not to have everyone start a company.

Good starting game for people unknown to 18XX. It can easily been played in about 2 1/2 hours. I don't think this game will become a classic for advanced 18XX players, but real 18XX-gamers are a small group. So this game can make new players more curious for this kind of games.

First play and despite having 3 veteren 18xx players involved we made a complete hash of the rules. I have to say the rule book could be better structured and ignoring the grammar and typos, the English is pretty strangled in places. 

Game is not for groups where players are prone to AP. People must be pre-prepared for their operating round moves or the game dies on its feet.

Production quality is superb.

Second Play and rating increased to an 8. A very clever game.

OK, I finally played my first 18XX and, as expected, it was not for me. A 4 hour stock market game? Hmmmm.

OK, I can see it is a well put together game and all but if you want the fine calculations Power Grid plays better in half the time. If you want the stock market stuff there are dozens of games out there. Not for me.

I like the railroad economics part of the game. Played with 4 players.  Two were new to the 18xx genre.  Myself and another have played many heavier games.  The first half of the game went quite well but after about halfway through the game we hit a wall and the game slowed to a crawl with tow much time being taken for turns.  The game theme and game if shorter, I would rate an 8 to 8.5 but for the length and slowing of gameplay going down to 6.  I would try again but I think I will try Steam Barons first.

RATING: 7.25
Not bad for the linear stock market variety of 18xx, there's a turn limit in this game which is something of interest and the train rush is so brutal that you may be able to run most of your trains, if you are lucky. That coupled with the low incomes that generally seem to be around, plus the early running, low capitalisation, low share formation to get companies going means that cash can be tight. Expect to see companies going under (although they don't drag the chairman down).

Plays quite quickly and is definitely one to have around in the 18xx lineup.

Good if you want a 'quick' 18xx - I prefer 1830 for the whole robber baron experience of stock manipulation and company dumping, but all in all, definitely a keeper.

A good entry level 18xx with a definite end.  Although I'd choose other 18XXs for a full game, I love the production value of this game and I tihnk it's an excellent way to teach new people.

28-Dec-12 -- just played it again for the first time in a long time.  My above opinion stands but I think I've passed the point where it's something I'll choose to play over other 18XXs.

(5 plays) After my first game I considered this game being work instead of being fun, BUT: after two or three games it started to grow on me. It is a serious brain burner, but after four games I was beginning to understand the game play, new strategies arose and it started being a LOT of fun. It seems to be a good introduction to the entire 18xx series as well.

Rating changed from 6 to 7 after three plays and changed again to 8 after four plays.

RATING: 6
The game is interesting and might be a 7 rating but I wont know for sure until I play it again. It takes the linear stock market of 1825 and stands it up vertically.  Companies are launched 1856 style with two shares being enough to start companies at the very beginning. But being a short game of only five rounds sucks much of the drama that I love about 18xx games out of the system.  With other 18xx games there is a huge incentive to open up all the companies in the game.  In this one, you'll get one, maybe two but there's not much time to make the second one pay off.  The train obsolescence is quite murderous (4s kill the 2s, 5s kill the 3s, and 6s kill the 4s) and coupling that with the short length makes the game pretty much just about managing the train rush. Getting two trains on a company is incredibly difficult and the cheap prices of the trains relative to the cash flow makes it easy for everyone to push for bigger trains.  Route optimisation is important, but boils down to essentially running to as many mapboard edge locations as possible. If I want a nice thick heavy strategy game in 2-3 hours, I'd rather play Le Havre or maybe Power Grid.  If I want to play an 18xx, I'll play 1830, 1856, or one of the other full 18xx games.

This is my ideal introduction to the system.  The game provides an interesting map and a somewhat forgiving tile set coupled with a brutal train rush.  The twists to the company flotation and train running rules also add some curious additions to the usual 18xx. 

The production is gorgeous and serves as a nice pull to players who might not normally take to an 18xx's particular aesthetic.

This has some of the looseness of 1830 removed, and is pleasantly finite (with the max 15 turns). There seems to be less opportunity to dump a company on another player, but I think that's by design.

As far as "intro to 18XX" games go, this seems to be the one to get. I've played 18AL, and I think there is more simplicity here without sacrificing the basics of the system. 

Finally, the map is great, as it really allows some decent routes early and some competition. The way companies can start operating with just the president's share out sets the stage for the late companies to jump on pre-existing track.

(Played with normal 18XX Priority Deal rules)

Steam Over Holland intrigues me. It's a good, solid, shorter 18XX game, but it's also strange in some ways to me that this is labeled a beginner's game. Not because the game is all that complex, indeed, many aspects of the game are in fact nicer to beginners (the lack of bankruptcy comes to mind) but rather because it has many rules that I consider unusual, odd tile design, and a rather hefty price tag. This is not at all similar to 1830. Company financing is not 1830, the stock market is not 1830. The most common game that uses rules similar to this is Winsome's Baltimore & Ohio. I'm not saying finance-as-you-go doesn't exist elsewhere, but the constant comparisons to 1830 are not at all on. The best intro to 1830, IMO, is still 1889, closely followed by 1830 itself.

The game runs on the concept of financing as you go. You buy shares, money goes into the company. The company can throw shares onto the market for cash or buy its own shares back. Companies can lay two tiles per turn, one an upgrade. This is very fast, obviously, but this is necessary because the game only goes 5 stock rounds and 10 operating rounds, always a stock, then two ops. The stock market is sort of 1D, but with cliffs to stop shares from falling too far. If a company must buy a train, then it has to sell its own shares, then the president must kick in money, but if the president doesn't have enough cash then they are not obligated to sell shares to cover it, they can just let the company die and continue to play, though, in practical terms, this can still finish people off if they have a sizable investment in that company.

In play, this is a pretty decent shorter length 18XX. The idea of having the game turn limited strikes me as a very good one, as in all-virgin groups money tends to enter the game much more slowly (as newer players are often very reluctant to flip shares to gain liquidity) so this will make it very approachable. I do question how viable flipping really is though, at least if the company is run well. It takes time to rebuild the infrastructure required to make a company profitable, and it seems like the turn-limited format makes flipping less lucrative than it would be otherwise. This combines with the "company can sell its own shares to raise money" to make presidential changes seem relatively unappealing compared to many 18XX games. This could be a long term limiting factor in this game. 

Also, the odd tile design and extremely high price tag really make this a tough game to recommend for newbies over other options. On the plus side, the resale value will be high if you want to resell it later, but still, pretty high cost. I'm not the biggest fan of the print and plays (AL and GA), and I'm aware that there is a long lead time on 1889, but I just don't see this as being viable unless you have a pretty large gaming budget, as comparable replacements cost half as much.

Veterans will likely enjoy the game for at least a play because of some of its odd rules (starting companies by buying shares equal to the phase number, extremely aggressively fast track laying, &c.) and newbies should get some value out of it as well. By and large, I like my 18XX games longer though, as I prefer to have some time to let the market and board develop, but for a shorter game this is decently solid; I just don't think it's possible to do a real short 18XX game well enough for me to really, really love it.

Instant classic. The 1D stockmarket is tight enough to make fighting over operating order with small stock fluctuations easy. Fierce Tokening, superb train rush. I like the rule about PD, but wonder if the right player number is determined by it (3 or 4).

The only real concern I have about this game is the lack of a privates auction, but it does serve to make the game more accessible.

Well, I sort of have this game.  I just took the shrink off my brand new copy, and it was missing all the track tiles.  That will make it tricky to play. But the publisher still has copies in stock--I've written to them and expect no difficulties.

Update: three months later, I finally have a complete copy of this.  Hope to play it again soon! 

Another update: This has gone on the trade list, mainly because I have too many 18xx games, and any time I'd play this one, I think, I'd probably choose Poseidon instead.

El juego me encantó, es la primera vez que pruebo un 18xx, aprendí a  jugar al 1861, pero no he podido probarlo porque requiere de demasiado esfuerzo en tiempo y compromiso, sin embargo este se juega bastante rápido comparado con cualquier otro 18xx ... en unas 3 horas lo tendrás apañado. Prescinde de bastantes detalles con respecto a otros de la serie, pero el "core" del sistema se mantiene y se comprime para poder jugaarlo en poco tiempo. La verdad es que me parece increíble que se haya podido comprimir este tipo de juegos en algo tan corto.

[31 May 2016] - 7.75 (1 @ 3 players)
A nice introduction to 18xx. More forgiving since the bank has unlimited funds and players can never personally go bankrupt. The map is pretty large and didn't feel cramped with 3 players until the very end. Not a game that rewards a build and dump strategy with the public companies. Single dimensional stock market was easy to understand.


[11 Apr 2017] - 7 (1 play)
After playing more 18xx titles (81, 46, 89), I'm seeing how this game is pretty simple for the genre. It lacks privates with unique powers, no minors and the tile set felt like it accommodated rather than leave players with conflict. I'd play it again over a lot of other games but I would rather play something else.

Excellent short 18xx-game. The limited-number-of-turns mechanism works very good to make a 2-3 hour game. The stock-martket game is not as cut-throat as other 18xx-games, but because it's easy to start a lot of companies early on , trains rust sometimes without ever having been able to use.

After playing some other 18XX games, this one seems to really lack the fun, sharp edges that the others have. I think the part that annoys me the most is the limited number of rounds. While it is great from a time to play perspective, it also severely restricts the number of available strategies. The board is also a bit open, with no really interesting chokepoints, or maybe it is simply that the interesting chokepoints were not taken advantage of because of inexperienced with using tokens properly. Still, this is probably my least favorite of the 18XX games.

This game will be the worst bgg-ranked one in my collection for many years to come probably, but Im sure that if this game would be more known out of the Netherlands, it could be easily in the top 200 game list. Steam over Holland was made as a 18xx introductory game, but in fact, although is not possible to dump companies, the game is not friendly at all, nor easy. Its rusting system is brutal, and youll have to take a lot of care with the trains run if you dont want to be in serious problems. When actioners sell stock their value is raised although not dramatically, but is still harder in this than other games like 1861. It is playable in 3 hours or even less by four experienced players, so its not only a very good game by its own but also it has many of the 18xx games good things packed in a shorter, much shorter, playing time. Two thumbs up, a wonderful little unknown gem. Ah, and the components are just outstanding, sturdy carboard, wonderful box (well, it has two boxes actually, one protecting the inner box, gorgeous). Of course it hasnt all the things a longer 18xx can offer, but for the amount of time it takes to play it really has many of them.

+ Wonderful components, it is like a collectors item.
+ No luck dependence at all.
+ Retains much of the core of the 18xx system in just 3 hours of gameplay.
+ Easy to explain, 18xx rules not difficult.
- Not very good scalability, the game shines with three players and can be played with four or even two, but five are really to many for this.
- Very expensive and hard to get out of the Benelux.

Only 1 play so far and I'm sure we had some of the rules wrong (initially).  This is our first 18XX experience and it was quite a positive one for the both of us despite the time it took to finish the game.  Blocking didn't seem to be a problem for our 2-player game.  Thematic but complex even for a supposedly introductory version.  No doubt this will hit the table again.  Handling the constant cash flow was a bit of a hassle with the paper money so maybe we'll get some chips before our next game.

An excellent short 18XX. The timeboxing idea is genius (I wish other titles did this) as it keeps the game length down and keeps the train progression furious even for normally timid players. The map and tile mix are detailed enough to allow the development of interesting routes but isn't quite as intricate as some other shorter 18XXes (such as 1846).

This now goes up there with 1889 as being among the best 18XXes to introduce to new players.

Slight minus: the private companies aren't especially interesting for the most part. They're serviceable but none seemed like it would significantly change anyone's strategy.

RATING: 8
Good gateway 18xx. I have played it with 3 players as well as 4 players. As the number of stock rounds and operating rounds are fixed, the game is relatively short for an 18xx game. Compared to most 18xx games, this is rather straight forward, but you will learn the basic concepts of this family of games, making it a lot easier to advance to more complex 18xx games.

Component quality is top-notch. The box even has a slip-cover, and each game is numbered in a limited edition.  Highly recommended for anybody who has an ambition to start exploring the world of 18xx.

A superb short 18xx that combines the playing time of 1825 (SoH can be comfortably finished in 2.5 hours) with the brutality of 18AL and the like. The ramp up in this game is close to vertical, in one OR you're earning next to nothing, in the next there's a huge dividend. This game has it all: stock shenanigans, company bankruptcy and a train rush so brutal that trains can rust before they run. The only down side that I can see is that there are no double-o or double-dot hexes to shake up the routes from game to game. The turn limit is simply genius, why can't more 18xx designers go down this route?

I certainly like this game, however I think that other 18xx games are better. Also I think considering the playing time there are better as heavy games. So its sorta in between.

There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing. The strategies and tactics of this genre will forever remain opaque to me.

RATING: 7
Top-notch production quality marks this 18xx game set in Holland. The game itself seems very similar to 1830, with a few additional twists. Unlike most 18xx games the number of turns for this one is fixed, leading to a fast game.

First impression: Steam over Holland seems a very nice addition to the 18xx series. Mechanically, it reminds me most of 1830 of the games I have tried, but it introduces an exciting new mechanic which allows companies to buy and sell their own stock. The map is not the most interesting I have seen, and like, say, 1825 Unit 3 (Scotland) the geography feels a bit constrained. The game *is* fast, our first game (with two veteran trainheads and one 18xx newbie) took about 2Â½ hours, not including the rules explanation. The somewhat long and drawn-out endgame you often get in 18xx games, where players perform small optimizations on their routes, while waiting for the bank to run out, is more or less removed here. That on the other hand means that really long-term strategies don't pay off: Getting a smooth transition to a permanent train without taking too many hits on the share price is essential, but the actual income on one's final routes is less important, since it will only be earned a few times.

Conclusion:
+ Fast.
+ Relatively simple and clean system.
+ Very nice components.

- Endgame feels a bit rushed (yeah, that's the price paid for having the short playing time :)).
- Geography isn't very interesting.

Overall, not my favorite 18xx game, but nevertheless a very nice entry in the series.

Described by another member of our group as "all the pain of a longer 18xx game condensed into three hours."  That's a good way to describe it.  Train purchases come blindingly fast.  Don't even think of a double 2-train opening.  I did that before looking at how few 2-trains there were.

I wouldn't recommend Steam Over Holland for an 18xx beginner, despite the short play time.  This one's for vets only.

Excellent game. Although I have not played any full blown 18XX games, this seems to have just enough elements to keep it very interesting but not too much that it is overwhelming. Turn order, track availability and market manipulation all have important factors. Although it may be typical in games of this type, a few rules are easy to forget (can't own more than 60% of a company, can't sell more than current shares held by other players, can't have more than 5 shares in the open market, etc.). Fixed # of rounds would help keep plays to a reasonable length. Have played with 3 and 4 - both of which have played very well.

18xx in the Netherlands. One of the faster 18xx games, as it is limited to 5 rounds. It could have been a good introduction to the game system, but unfortunately the designer/publisher decided to use a new convention of the symbols used on the tiles and some of the tweaks in the rules are needlessly complex (like the criteria for starting a company or the amount of shares that can be sold/bought by a company during an operating round).

Thought the stock market was way too forgiving.  Beautiful production, I'll give it that.  Kind of sorry I didn't get it when it was 50 Euros, but even that price was pretty hefty.  Beautifully produced game. Well-contained 18xx game, after playing I think I 'get' these games much better. However, not sure I liked the 'plateaus' in the stock prices, as it really limited your ability to check the leader. We had a runaway that I couldn't catch. Nice to have a map based on the Netherlands, especially since I myself ride the trains so often here.

I have already taught four beginners to play 18xx using this game.  The designer will soon be posting a new version of the rules, which I helped edit.  While I expect this game to retain my interest for a long time, advanced 18xx enthusiasts may not agree.  The components are some of the most beautiful in my collection.

Este iniciático 18XX es un juego duro, no el mas duro de la saga, pero si más complicado que la media de juegos que podemos encontrar en el mercado. Nos obligará a detener nuestra atención en demasiados puntos: trayectos, dividendos, valores del mercado, trenes, etc; sin perder el foco del objetivo principal del juego, poseer la mayor fortuna tras 15 rondas.

Looks great, impressive components and nice attention to detail (authenticity certificate and all!). The game plays well, too. It's clearly best with three, as there's more money - starting two companies is an option. I won't play with five anymore, that just wasn't much fun.

There's lots of good stuff, and especially with the new updated manual, this really is a pretty good intro game to the 18xx series. I've been able to play this one in about three hours including rules and setup, which is nice. 

However, I sold my copy, as I just didn't see much reason to keep this one in my collection.

Indifferent.

I was expecting a "lightweight" 18xx game to take about 2-3 hours - but we played for about 5.  I really enjoy Age of Steam and had never played an 18xx game.  Although I still like Age of Steam better, I'd definitely try another 18xx game if given the chance.  This was a good intro to the system.

It's a great game to expand my horizons into the 18xx world. And after playing this great 18xx lite game I can safely come to the conclusion that I will never play any other 18xx game but this one again. Because if this is a "short" 18xx, then it is as long as I ever want to play one.

It has the virtue of being fast (2-2.5 hr with experienced players), both because it's a small game and because the number of rounds is strictly limited.

The stock market interplay feels a lot like 1846, in that having people buy your shares too early is somewhere between bad and extremely bad because it limits the eventual capitalization that your company can get.

Consensus in my group at the moment seems to be that the privates aren't worth much more than face value, if that.  We don't know everything about the game yet, though.

Relatively simple 18xx game. Needs more play for final judgement.

Components are very nice. Beautiful bookcase box, mounted map, heavy cardstock sheets/cards.

Downsides:
The manual is written for 18xx experts while the game was intended for new players. The yellow tiles were misprinted as lime green.

First impression (5 players): It's a 18xx series train game all right. The parts that stand out after the first game were very nice visual help box about phases and the fact companies own all leftover stocks and can sell/buy them during the game. Something similar to SoH's visual help should be available for all 18xx series games. Really helps during the first game. As companies have their own stocks and can sell them to open market to raise money it is easier to actually get money to companies. By selling them or through dividends. This feature makes game easier and would make Steam over Holland a nice gateway game to 18xx series if it wouldn't be so hard to acquire one. 

I'm not sure if it is possible to make a 18xx series game and make a bad game as the basic structure underneath is so strong and good. Nonetheless Steam over Holland is a very good game and I want to play more of it.

Update (4 players): There doesn't seem to be too much cash floating around even with less players. I'm not sure I like this as it makes a game bit less exciting if there are only about as many companies as players (and usually one per player). Nevertheless, I still enjoyed the game very much.

This may be considered light, easy for a 18xx game, but for someone who hasn't played anything of that series before (except one game of 1856 years ago), it's still a very heavy experience. It takes rather long if you're used to euros.

But it was enjoyable, and I look forward to my next game of SoH. It helps that the geography of the map is familiar.

Update: after a few more plays, the game flows better and goes faster. With more understanding of the mechanics, it turns out to be an enjoyable 2.5 hours. I've mainly played this 2-player, which works quite well.

It looks a lot like 18xx. Knowledge of the 18xx series saves a lot of time in understanding the rules however game play is completely different.

A fine intro to the 18XX system, because of the limited number of turns. Nice components, and gameplay. It's interesting that companies can go bankrupt, but PLAYERS are not required to sell their own stock to cover the forced train purchase. There is also an optional rule for the priority deal that should be used.

People at a gaming convention would always choose something else. The tile tension is rough. The train rush (with "poison 4 train" syndrome) is wild, which dissuades some, but overall I like it fine. It is not a deep game, but a good weeknight play. I like owning it. The components are quite nice.

Seems very typical of all the other 18xx games to me - a slightly shorter playtime, but not otherwise very different. I won't refuse to play, but I'm really not a fan of these games at all (and therefore the shorter play time is actually an advantage - but not enough of one).

Initial play w/ 3P, 2 of whom were 18xx neophytes.  Game flowed along nicely, but did clock in at 3 hours after rules explanation. Part of that length might be from all players playing the map for the first time and thinking about possibilities.  Good introduction to 18xx style games without some of the harshness of those games  (for example, as the rules state - companies can go bankrupt, players can't.)  Has quite a bit of key concepts of an 18xx  game to make it a reasonable intro game, especially as it is in a well-produced package.  The basics of stock rounds and operating rounds nicely brought to light.  Due to the length of game play, don't know how often our group might play this one, but certainly shorter and more playable than many other 18xx games out there.  A good entry-point to the genre to consider.

More 18xx, but this time kinder and gentler, for the Euro crowd. Very little tile or share screwage, and no player bankruptcy. I was worried that the ledge would nerf the stock market, but happily you can still dump companies in the time honoured tradition. It is a very gentle market compared to 1830, though.

The partial capitalisation here is a double edged sword: it's easy to start a company, but it's also easy for it to go under in the train rush unless it issues shares regularly. The built in time limit coincides nicely with the 6 and 3E trains coming out, though the 3E trains (with their increased cost) don't seem to come out much.

This is a good choice for an introductory 18xx, or a short game 18xx (playing time is 2-3 hours). If you have more time available, I think something like 1830 or 18AL is more enjoyable for gamer types. Having said that, the manual is hard to follow, so it would be best if at least one player had 18xx experience (e.g. from the 1830 PC game, or by reading through some of the 18AL learning sessions on BGG). 

I think this would be best with 5 players. With less than that it's hard to get a good distribution of publics.

The private auction is bit clunky here, and I'd prefer to use the 1830 method.

Wow, this one is a mindbender.  There is certainly some serious group think in setting initial par prices, pacing the train rush, and so on.  It has a steep ramp into the heart of the game, which leaves little room to dilly dally. With four the game is quite tight, I can't imagine trying to play this with five, the train rush would just be stupid.  Supposedly this is an into system, but I usually do quite well in 18xx games and got worked. 
There is usually time to correct mistakes in these games and to balance out for a long game strategy, not here.  It is a whirling dervish with a thousand blades.   You need to get in and get dirty.  Quite a compelling!

RATING: 5
A decent train game, but with some real imbalances. It's supposed to be an intro-level 18xx game, but the concepts that are simplified are not the ones that (in my experience) cause new players much trouble, anyway. A better intro path would be Imperial or Chicago Express followed by 1830.

I'd been meaning to try this ever since its release (with all the stuff about "short playable 18xx" that I'd heard). The three train-gamers were waiting for DavidF, but he'd overslept! So I jumped in.

In fact, this does seem like a good introduction to the 18xx system, playing more quickly but retaining the ability to really mess each other's plans and cash hoard through stock manipulation and control of game pace. It might be a bit too harsh an introduction (not the kinder/gentler intro that 18FL gives you), but at least it plays quickly! Unfortunately, it may play a bit _too_ quickly -- trains become obsolete almost before you can use them! I don't think I'm likely to play this one again.

Excelent production with real card board for the tracks. Private companies don't have a major role on this game. It's a kind of a simple 18xx. I like the lenght of it (15 turns tops). Rules are poorly writen but the simplicity of them and the neat and clean mechanics compensate. A must play for everyone who enjoys train/economic games.

My first proper 18XX experience. I ended up liking it quite a lot, although I'm sure I missed 80% of the fine nuances of the genre. What I didn't miss, was the excessive playing time you see in the more heavy 18XX titles. At three hours, this is an enjoyable game. At 5 or more, it would send me away screaming. 

But is it just me, or do scores always fall within 5% of each other?

Good game, although it is a bit confusing to see where the rail tracks go and how building them works. I like the buying and selling of shares in the companies, and that the price of the shares changes over time. It's not so important to have your own space to build tracks, because you can use other peoples' tracks, and being where the action is is an advantage.

Streamlined and accessible 18xx game. Like other games in the series players have to purchase shares in railway companies, decide on where to place routes between towns and cities, and then run trains on those routes thereby earning income for shareholders. Where 'SoH' differs from other games in the series, it has a set number of turns which means that players know how much time they have available to them in order to accomplish their aims. The stock-market mechanism is greatly simplified, resulting in it being a lot more forgiving than in some other games in the series. 'SoH' is extremely playable mainly in part to its reduced play-length but obviously it loses some of the 18xx depth of play due to this.

This is a great introduction to the 18XX system with the added bonus of having beautiful components. However, the steep price tag sort of undermines the game's purpose, as someone looking to give 18XX "a try" isn't likely going to shell out big bucks to do so. Moreover, I question how much depth and re-play value the game has, especially in contrast to "real" 18XX titles, which even makes the steep price more of a problem.

A great introduction to 18xx.  Not necessarily bare bone but it stripped away a lot of the intricacies in company management, stock manipulation and tile laying to make the game easier to teach and more accessible to the uninitiated.  Don't mistake that for easy or gentle though, because mistakes can still be costly.

Personally, I didn't find Steam over Holland as fun after having already played several other 18xx.  The strict set of tracks and the hard limit of 15 rounds felt like the game was cut short just when it started to get interesting.  Would not recommend it with 5.  This is a worthwhile addition for fans of 18xx or those that just don't have the 3+ hours to commit to a longer version.

01/27/08 - Hmmmmmmm...Stock market seemed pretty forgiving - perhaps a little too forgiving.  Not sure it's to my taste, although the old ball & chain said she preferred it to 1825 because she could focus more on the rail-building and less on stock management.  I'm a fan of both combined, but will be unsure whether or not Steam Over Holland has what it takes until after I've had another go at it.

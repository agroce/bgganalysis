A tile-laying, set collection, route planning game with multiple ways to score that scales well from 2-5 players.

This is a light strategy game that is very accessible to new players, despite the somewhat convoluted scoring, money making, etc.  A nice touch in that there are 2 boards included plus an option to print several others online (which I still need to investigate).

You only have 3 actions per turn (of course you want to do so much more), such as buy a card, play a card (which can be land, which is generally points, or animal, which generally leads to points and money, which is more points), purchase a hacienda (points), harvest (money, which also translates into points), or buy water (points).  

As you can see there are several ways to score (connect animals to markets, build land chains, haciendas, surrounded water, and money), and there are definite opportunites to screw other players (blocking, taking the needed card, accelerate the pace of the game).  As a 2-player it's mainly an optimization game (which my wife and I enjoy) and with more, there's alot more conflict/interaction.  This is a game that gets better with more plays.

A great couples and/or family game. Easy to learn and mild enough for everyone to rack up scoring or can be cut throat. Down time is not bad at all for experienced players.  Somewhat repetitive in what to do and limited depth but never the same game.  Glad to have in our collection.

This is looking dated - it's a neat design from Kramer but the production is dull as ditch water, with drab graphics and colours. Kingdom Builder offers a similar but more variable experience in a prettier - and shorter - package.

RATING: 8
That was a pretty fun game.  It's quite tense when you're approaching the end of the animal deck and you've only got 3 actions per turn.  It's quite easy to lose track of the scoring, and get whomped by someone who's connected to more markets than you.  Very enjoyable.

RATING: 7
3 plays / 4 players

LIKE: Going after the cards or laying land, is very tense. Each turn felt essential and the feeling of wanting to do everything, but not being able to, kept the game tense.

DISLIKE: Theme is dry. Box is ugly. The symmetrical bone board side is not as great.

OVERALL: Solid, competitive game. Simple, yet plenty of strategy. The money mechanism added a nice rhythm, and the harvest action was a nice catch-up mechanism. Every time I play this I think that I should play it more, but I think without modular maps, there is little variance from game to game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very interesting game.  Part of the "Go Light" trilogy with Kingdom Builder and Through the Desert.  This one may be my favourite.

Unfortunately, I think a lot of the replayability comes from the hundreds of maps you can play online.  With the physical game, there are only 2 maps.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Hacienda has quite a similar feel with the original Ticket to Ride. You collect cards which are used to claim land with the goal to connect to markets and water. So nothing special here. However, it has been a good choice to impose a hand limit on the players, because it will keep the game rolling forward at all times and practically  eliminates hoarding.

The game plays very differently with varying player numbers, since the map does not scale up or down. With more players the game is more tactical due to the chaos, although the planning horizon is never very far even in a two player game.

The biggest appeal of the game is that it satisfies your most primitive needs of matching cards to the terrain and collecting sets. I actually find it quite fun. Scoring is not the most elegant as it requires careful calculations. The same applies to how money is earned. As a matter of fact, I think that the game would have been just fine even without the money.

One of the easiest played games I have ever played with a lot of strategy.  Rule explanation is a snap and takes only about 5 minutes - amazing for a game of this weight.  Components are gorgeous.  There have been some complaints about # of players, (3 or 2) having less conflict.  While this is true, it does not ruin the game - just play more aggressively.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An interesting game.  I like the balance between purchasing cards, spending them to put lands and animals on the board, and the need to make money along the way.  The limited actions force you to make careful decisions.  Towards the end, it more clearly becomes an issue of min-maxing, but there are enough scoring mechanisms that many options are available.

Negatives:  Even with the various options, it's just not that interesting to me.  Players tend to end up specializing in a particular animal.  There's a little blocking here and there.  The gameplay just isn't deep or varied enough.

Still, it's a fun game and I would play it every now and then.

RATING: 10
I love this game, which is not to say that I'm terribly good at it.  I feel very challenged by it, which perhaps accounts for my enthrallment with it.  I think as it comes out of the box I'd rate it a 9, but all the user-created maps over on spielbyweb make for an endless diversity.  Throw in 2 different variants on 25 or so vastly different maps and you've got a seemingly endless parade of possibilities.  And now that I've started creating my own maps, the magic only grows.  Give it a try over on spielbyweb before you buy it.  It's free and you might find yourself hanging around for more.

I really enjoyed my first playing of this game, I'll definitely be playing this one again. I was worried this would be "just another Euro", but it wasn't; it felt fresh and different. This is currently my favourite Kramer design. There was a nice tension approaching the end of the game as you try to work out how much more you can do.

I like the different scoring mechanisms and the balance between points and money.

I see two downsides
* The money makes it fiddly. I wouldn't play without it, but there was a lot of shuffling of money cards around. Poker chips should improve this.
* Connecting markets seems like an overly strong strategy. It gives you a lot of points and money. I know there have been rebuttals to this, though.

Rating after a single play.  An OK game that feels like Through the Desert only slightly more complex. I'm not quite sure what to make of this game.  I came in dead last but by mid-game it was quite obvious that I'd made glaring mistakes with my initial land placements that took me out of the running all together.  Although I know I'd never make the same placement mistakes again, with all the other ways to score points you'd think that the game would be more forgiving.  My rating will probably go up with more playings and I think that the game has more replayability with the two board setups and random card draws.
Update: after a couple more games of this one, I've gained some respect for it.  the rating moved from 6.5 to 7.5

The experience of playing this game reminded me a lot of playing Ticket To Ride.  You pick some spots that look nice to build and then just sit around gathering cards (which come up randomly) so that you can build there.  The problem is that decisions are not deep or numerous enough compared to all the card-moving you do to find out who ultimately wins.  Money and space is usually plentiful, and there are so many avenues to score, that there is very little sense of pressure or the opportunity to cut someone off with a clever move.  It's light and friendly and boring.

i wanted to like this one so bad.  love the production and the price.  2-sided everything, nice colors, short rules.  hey, included variants!  for openers, i strongly prefer scoring as you go, but it still feels kludgy.  there are huge interaction issues depending on the number of players, and little incentive for people to interrupt others' chains instead of developing their own.  i hate how people stalled around until somebody finally took the last card to end the turn, so that's most of what drives my scoring preference.  it pained me to trade my copy, but i felt like i had to.  just not quite enough polish for me from the designer.  i'd still play it again.

RATING: 7
We've now played this enough so that it is a simple matter of sitting down and playing -- nobody needs rules explained, everyone knows what they are going to try and do. It's good to get a nice complex game like this one to that level. We're also pretty evenly matched, as our extremely close scores in the last game show!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
There are definitely elements in the game play that are likeable, but the overall game is troubled.  The 2 scoring rounds split the game into a scramble and a defense.  The second half results in little actual opportunity to alter your position.  The fixed map(s) also lead to what appears to be optimal positions, forcing some players into spoiler rolls to prevent another's advantage. This is done at the expense of those playing spoiler having a shot in the game.  A frustrating play experience.  [GTI Code: TGSD]

Very good game.  Played with 5 players and enjoyed the interaction and competing for land and livestock and their associated points.  Based on the variable game boards that can be used it sounds as this game should have a high replay values.  Though I wonder if it scales down well with fewer players.  I think they should re-theme it for the US market and call it "Texas" or maybe "Ranching".

I really wanted to like this one. Herr Kramer is my favorite designer overall, and this, being one of his recent "heavy" games, I had to try.

And so I did, I've played 10+ games in yucata.de already, and I must say, with sadness, that I don't like the game.

I can't even determine what it is that I didn't like. The tile placement feels a bit random, but that hasn't deterred me from other tile-laying games with similar randomness. Plus, you can actually decide what to take. The theme is not the coolest ever, but at least it's not been overdone yet.

I even like the way you can score in multiple ways, and the need to balance out your animal herds.

So what is it? I guess it's the union of it all. It's the chaotic nature, plus the nastiness of the game, plus the need to keep your mind at several parts of the board (and of the scoring)... maybe if it didn't have all those things, I would like it. As it is, the sum of all it's parts is not a fun one for me.

RATING: 6
Vaguely reminiscent of Through the Desert in that you play tokens down to form animal (and farm) networks. In Hazienda however, there is no area enclosure scoring mechanism. Hazienda relies more on connection and tactical set formation on the board both for points as well as wealth generation. Perhaps the most innovative aspect is that you have to pay for your animal and farm tokens before you can play them. Ideal game length for me (~1 hr) with plenty of meaningful decisions. Might be a good gateway game (approachable theme).

After about a dozen plays I have some design concerns with the base game. IMO: 1) turn order needs to be balanced by aggressive game play; 2) fairly singular path to victory (can't beat a large land mass connected to multiple markets); 3) the game requires competent, equally skilled players to have a competitive game otherwise the player who is unchallenged (generally with an early, large central farm base) will win easily; 4) pampas tiles are crazy; 5) runaway leader problem due to the 2 cumulative scoring rounds. I'm interested in trying out the published variant to see if it's more balanced. I had considered this a must buy but it's now in the never-own pile.

RATING: 5
Az egyszerű szabályt végigolvasva amolyan tizenkettő egy tucat játéknak tűnt, de játszva egész jó. Lapkákat pakolunk le (ültetvényeket, állatlapkákat, tavakat), és kb.5 féle módon lehet pontot szerezni. Nem kell túl komplex döntéseket hozni, könnyed kategória. A szabály jól meg van írva, a játékrendszere egzakt, rengeteg anyag van hozzá (kártya és lapka). A tábla szép, kétoldalas. Tehát minden rendben van vele. De valahogy mégsem érzem átütőnek, és kicsit még most is bennem van az az érzés, amit a szabály olvasásnál is megállapítottam, hogy nagyon sok hasonló jellegű játék van. Nem tudom megítélni, mennyire volt úttörő ez a játék 2005-ben, de manapság nem sok eredeti ötlet látszik benne, sőt a téma is elég elcsépelt (ld. Agricola). De jól össze van rakva, talán ami még zavaró lehet benne, az a szerencse bosszantó szerepe az állat pakliból kezdetben kivett lapokon keresztül.

Hacienda is usually compared with either Through the Desert or Ticket to Ride.  However, lately I have been thinking of Hacienda as a Brass-lite for non-gamers.    Hacienda is divided into two scoring phases and it also features an economic component that is entirely absent from TTD or TTR.   

I am interested in the variable map generator and the possibility for variant rules for each map, but alas I lack a super duper colored printer.

Based on one playing. I loved the slightly humorous art and colors of this game, it looks better live than in the pictures. The theme, pampas of Argentina, has not been done before. And the only agression is blocking opponents, as in other tyle laying games. Strategy consists of trying to maximize your points / income every turn, and perhaps stopping others from doing the same.

This game seems to combine everything Kramer ever did before. There are action points, card drafting/management, area enclosure, tile laying and all of this with a strong economic flavour. While I can't really say there's anything wrong with this game, I didn't really like it after the first play. I feel there are too many elements mashed together. Maybe I'll warm up to it. At the moment it's just a mêh for me.

Another favorite of my wife and Is.  Works fine with two, just play on a subset of the map.  I usually pick the black markers, and mark off a smaller area, making sure to keep it even.

Very enjoyable - lots of ways to score and a great deal of flexibility required to take advantage of the available resources and the space left by your opponents. Can be tough for anyone left well behind after the first scoring but otherwise a solid 8.

After several plays on SBW, uprated slightly. This is a very solid game.

After around 40 plays downrated to a 7 for the difficulty of recovering after a tough first half and the fact that it is way too overcrowded with 5p, yet not crowded enough with 3.

I play it online on Yucata, but I don't know that I'd play it in person. I find it very frustrating. There are lots of games that don't give you enough moves or time to do what you really want to do, but I find that the three-action-per-turn limitation here is really, really frustrating, and almost annoying.

UPDATE:
The more I play it, the more I like it. I've learned a few tricks. I would like to try it in person, though I think I'd really miss having the score automatically calculated and visible after every move.

RATING: 7
Whoah, what a surprise.  Kramer, despite crafting the genius El Grande, is not a designer I respect much.  However, with Hacienda he has struck gold.  Perhaps it is just me, but I get a strange Knizia vibe from this design.  I think the obvious comparison here is the scoring system, multifarious and robust, but balanced with Knizian care.  With a playing time of less than an hour, Hacienda crams considerable depth into a concise package, another Knizia hallmark. Two things mar this otherwise perfect package.  A cadre of other geeks labors upon the first and that is that the bone board sucks.  Having two interesting, playable boards available would have done miracles for the out-of-the-box longevity.  Second, all the variants included seem like an excuse to not have to finish the design.  Instead the players must figure out which provides the most compelling game.  At the least, produce a basic rule set and an advanced rule set.

Update:  Perhaps it is just design fatigue, but this game has fallen for me in a couple ways.  I am not sure if the scoring methods are at all balanced and, if the included variants are any indication, I am not sure Kramer was either.  Second, the depth here has proved illusory, contrary to my initial impressions.  Down to a 7.

RATING: 9
Based in one play with 3 players. It's a good game but I think this game needs 4-5 players to get all the juice.

*update* 

Played with more players on yucata.de and liked more. It's a very good game. Tense because 3 actions per turn is never enough and others can block your plans.

I printed a 2 player board hoping to getting to the table more.

*update*

After more than 6 years since I played Hazienda for the first time, and unfortunately having played it way more games on-line that face2face, I can say with no doubt that I really love this wonderful game, I'd keep my copy forever.

It's an amazing game, maintain in the top 500 after 10 years with so many new games every year is a real achievement.

Definitely enjoyable.  Set collection, action point allowance & tile placement.  Always too much to do and not enough turns.  Be careful that you don't build a huge hand of cards because the game ends fairly quickly and you'll be stuck with a lot of cards (wasted action points).  At first I thought that tagging a bunch of markets would be a viable strategy, but now I'm not sure.  Building big herds and farmlands is important (for making money & points).  Also, paying to place water tiles is very important for scoring points; I under-estimated the value of adding lakes/ponds in my first game.

Extra special thanks to my 2006 BGG Secret Santa. I had this on my wishlist because of several recommendations and now I know why - this is a solid, fun game. However, I've been trounced every time I've played, and I realize that I have some trouble dealing properly with the endgame. It always seems to come up too fast, without enough time for me to do what I wanted, or to make good use of what I've done. There are a lot of different paths to victory, but I seem to be unable to capitalize on any of them, which is starting to become frustrating. My initial excitement for the game has cooled a little bit, and my rating has lowered from 8 to 7.

There is a lot of nuance to this game.  I was happy to see that as a new player I came in dead last... the more experienced players were rewarded by their better plays.  I think I need to be more patient before making plays as any attempts to move into an area that was being developed by another player was quickly headed off.  I'm looking forward to playing again!

It's a race to connect locations on a hexagon divided map like Through the Desert but instead of just claiming a hexagon spot you have to play a card matching the ground type. Cards are bought with money, money is earned through reaching markets. You can add water tiles to increase scoring.

It's a solid game and scratches the same itch as Through the Desert but the card drawing aspect does add a luck element.

Feels a bit bland though.

Aquirido en Marzo2010 a Sacarino a través de la BSK. En aleman por 18+6€. Buena compra

Es un juego de gestión de propiedades. Cada uno tiene que colocar sus propiedades estratégicamente, conectar los rebaños a los mercados para obtener dinero, comprar haciendas y expandirse para obtener mayor número de puntos. Hay dos recuentos de puntos en la partida. Gana el que al final tiene más.

Es sencillo, pero bastante sesudo e invita a hacer calculos. Varias formas de ganar.  Admite hasta cinco jugadores. 

Muy a mi pesar abandonó mi ludoteca el 3/12/2014, por falta de juego. Se le vendí a través de la BSK a Musambay por 17 euros + gastos de envío. Snif. Es una pena. Era buen juego.

Ratings based on two multiplayer FTF games, a few multiplayer online games, and about 10 two-player online games.  I REALLY like this as a two-player game (rating 8) but feel that four- and five-player games are a little too chaotic for my taste (rating 7).  It's still a good game, but too much happens between turns to have a reasonable shot at planning, which gets extremely frustrating.

This is a great game that features card drafting, three actions per turn, and an economic element that you build on to get victory points.  Sure it shares features with other games but Hacienda can stand up to the best of them. Excellent game all around.  It didn't seem like everything would fit in the box very well and everything would flop around but I found that by putting the five cardboard frames that all the pieces are punched out of underneath the plastic insert in the box bottom that everything fits snugly.

An interesting abstract, similar to Through the Desert but with more options for building and scoring points. I still don't feel like I know what the best route for scoring is, which only means that there is more replayability here. 

I really hate that the tiles have different colors and animals on each side.  It can be a real pain having to fish through a stack of tiles to find one of your last pigs (or to resort to switching them out on the board). In fact, the fiddliness of the game might mean that I play this exclusively on the iPad from now on. We'll see...

This is really good. I don't usually consider Kramer a hugely reliable name personally, but this was a very pleasant surprise. It's odd in that it feels vaguely reminicient of a few games (Reibach maybe, Through the Desert) without actually feeling derivitive. Lots of interesting choices, a very sensible playing time (an hour-ish), simple to explain. I like this new trend towards double-sided boards. The sheet of variants is a nice touch too, as the game is clearly suitable for them.

This, along with Beowulf and Elasund, were the unsurprising top picks from Essen (the top 3 designers from the top "gamer's game" labels; what a shock). Even so, I liked all three of these significantly more than I expected, and Hacienda was an especially pleasant surprise.

Hmm. This game had some interesting devices and was fun - during the first half of the game.   The second half seemed to devolve into doing whatever you could to score points as positions and territories had more or less been set and defined by that point.  Since the jockying for position was over, we were left to ourselves to do what minimal actions we could: place a pampas here, add to a herd there, maybe buy a watering hole.  If the whole game contained the tenseness of the land grabbing first half, this might be a winner.

UPDATE: Played again and the second round was not nearly so stale this time.  Upgraded from a 5 to a 6.  I'd go higher, but I'm not certain as to why the game changed and am concerned that my first experience could happen with some regularity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Good game that kind of reminds me of Ticket to Ride due to the card drawing mechanism and the fact that you always want to do more than you're allowed.  Tons of scoring options mean that there are lots of tough decisions.  After a few replays, I've lowered my rating as it only appears that there is one road to winning.  Also, turn order seems to be a big issue, as the last player is really at a disadvantage.

Cows, sheep, pigs and horses...farms...ZZZ...ZZZ...

That was my first impression about this game when I checked it out after hearing about Hacienda being in some business games list. Played my friend's copy yesterday because he had it with him and we wanted to try something new. Unpunched his mint copy. Still seemed boring with all the cows, sheep, pigs and horses counters and cards.

After he explained the rules, it still seem to be boring. After the 3rd turn, my opinion of the game did a U-turn. Hey, despite the cows, sheep, pigs and horses (and farms), this is a great game!

There is tension in the card layout as you eye the three little pigs. Will your opponents take them? Or shall you start out a cow farm first? Shall you expand your markers and get more land or shall you provide your herd with water and get meatier pigs? When and where will you start your second and third herd? Will you block your opponent so that he cannot reach the market or will you build a hacienda?

All in all a surprisingly good game with a boring theme.

Another solid medium-light weight game from Wolfgang Kramer. This plays well with anywhere from 2-5 players, plays quickly, and offers a lot of depth given its shallow learning curve and modest time requirements. Another bonus is that  two maps are included and there's a free map generator offered by the publisher. A possible downside for some however is the dry theme and its lack of relevance to the game mechanics, even by German standards. It's essentially a good tile laying abstract that I think fans of games like Through the Desert would enjoy. It has definitely grown on me the more I've played it.

I like the different mechanics here, and they all make sense together.  Imagine TTD mixed with China/Web of Power and a little bit of Kramer's action point games, and you have Hacienda.  I would play with 2-3, and possibly 4, but the length of the game with 5 kept it from being enjoyable.  People were getting bored.  Choosing an unbalanced strategy is not good.  You can't compete this way, and it can drag the game out, since the animals determine the game length.  This game places heavy importance on gaining little tactical advantages, like Kramer's action point games.

I have played this game online and in person at least 25 times now. The game comes down to using your actions the best way possible to score points in a abstract type way. The game is pleasant to play and is not overly complicated, so it can fit just about any game group, and that's really cool! There are some tough decisions in this game, and when to do some of those decisions adds so much tension. If there was a modular board it would be super cool, add some more variety to the game, but the game board does come with 2 sides to play.

We play this 2-player, which takes 40 minutes to an hour.  I prefer going second, as I feel it gives me more control over the end of each round.  Reading through the rule booklet, I didn't find the examples very helpful and thought I was going to be confused about how to score.  However, I didn't have any trouble once we started playing.  The chips are printed with different pictures on each side.  The idea is that if you run out of a picture, you rummage the board to find an already-played chip that has what you need on the other side and replace it with a different chip.  I find this really annoying!  This game definitely has similarities to Through the Desert.  Although we prefer Through the Desert, we would happily play either.  The livestock theme on this one appeals to me.

Buy cards to play tiles to make money or points. A bit of a point salad with some spatial set collection, some connection scoring, and money to points. Overall, it is a nice little game, though.

Don't think I like this game. Too much rides on the luck of the draw. I tried both sides of the board and find them both flawed in some respect. If there were a way to reduce the "luck" factor, this game has lots of potential. The pampas card are rare, and if you don't draw any you will lose. I can't see how this flaw can produce a good game. When we all drew our equal share of pampas, the game was quite interesting and fun. I consider this game broken, yet people who like fast, cutthroat games will enjoy Hacienda.

Hacienda reminds me most of Through the Desert, but there is a lot of additional apparatus here. I always like games where there is a competing need to establish economy and score points. Here however, some of the ways to score points feel almost arbitrary. I enjoy the decisions the game gives you, but it feels a bit stretched. Also, in a 5p game there may be too much going on between your actions. The chaos gets higher. I also note that he intial positions can favor the first couple players. Players must recognize that and deliberately attack them or there is no mechanism to ameliorate that advantage.

After playing further, I feel this game has no soul. It was over and I felt like I'd just used a leaf-blower in the driveway.

(Variant 1 & Asymmetrical Board)

Kramer does Durch die Wueste with some added excitement.

Hazienda is a fairly straight-forward tile placement game ala Durch that adds a gamut of scoring systems, which is almost more Knizia-like than that title. Players in Hazienda are trying to chain both animals and land together, connect to markets, and to place both of those items near water. The entire game is card driven though, and that is facilitated by a face up draw pool of both land and animal cards which one can buy and which then allow placement on the appropriate land type or of the appropriate animal type. 

Hazienda is interesting to me not because it does anything particularly new, but simply because I think it is doing something old significantly better. For a light tile laying game that should play in about an hour this is quite good. The different approaches to the game seem relatively well balanced, as with the first variant (which seems to be the consensus pick of the experienced) the land chain value is reigned in by increasing the value of herds and the encouragement of large ones. Like a Durch, one is still just trying to maximize points as much as possible, but because of the varying cards and possibilities, it does require some more thought and look-ahead.

Egyszerű, könnyed családi játék. Egy 3 fős partin vagyok túl és továbbra sem találkoztam rossz Kramer játékkal, ez is tetszett mindannyiunknak. 

Néhány újabb játék után esett az értékelésem, ennek két oka van:
- ha valaki a játék elején elhúz, lehetetlen felzárkózni a többieknek
- ha valaki rossz/jó szériát fog ki laphúzáskor, az eldöntheti a végső sorrendet!
- terjeszkedéseink közben arra kell törekedni, hogy kiszorítsuk egymást, tulajdonképpen ez egy kiszorítós játék. A kiszorítósdival nincs bajom, ha nem csak abból áll a játék, de itt igencsak erre kell játszani a győzelemhez...
- eddig szinte mindig az volt a végeredmény, ami a játék felénél történő pontozáskor...

Ettől függetlenül érdemes kipróbálni.

Solid. Very familiar feel. I.e. feels like a lot of other games. The land spaces/cards are pretty bad, unfortunately. There's a circle in the corner of the cards where I nice clear icon should have gone, but they just put a tiny portion of the picture, and some of the land cards (especially those corners) look pretty darn similar. Sort of reminds me of Kreta, in that it's a solid design, despite the fact that it doesn't really offer anything that feels fresh. I do really like the "classic" feel of games like this. There's a pretty big bonus to knowing that the current turn is the last before scoring, and I don't care for the mechanic where players later in the turn order get to realize this where earlier players do not.

RATING: 7
When I was first taught the game I thought it a somewhat boring affair: 3 actions per turn, most of which seemed obvious. But my sweetheart was more persistent about it and eventually bought it, and since then, this game's star has been rising. This is partially due to the lovely production, but also due to the game's interesting mix of area enclosure and area control. Those are things you seldomly see in modern boardgames, and I happen to like them a great deal. How I could have missed this during the first play is a little unclear, though.

In any case, the players attempt to grow their little livestock empire on the Argentinian pampa by claiming plots of land forming chains, and then placing herds of different animals in contact with those landchains in order to bring them to market. For that they get money with which the players can make further investments. An alternative way to get cash is by harvesting a long land chain, offering another way to play this title&mdash;but like with any game offering such strategies, you must stick to them to maximise their performance. That said, Hazienda is is not a snowball game as the amount of money you get out of getting your animals to market is too little to make it grow substantially before the game ends; it is better to view upon it as a mechanic to make sure the game continues. Players can attempt to create 'holes' in their empire which they can subsequently fill with water pools: these bring in a lot of points and can be very effective if used in a timely and correct fashion. All in all, there is a good balance between expansion and deciding to block other players, although this only becomes readily apparent with 4, and is but noticable with 3. With 2 players, and on standard maps, the game is a dull race which I cannot recommend.

What I somewhat dislike about Hazienda is that markets in the basic setup are worth a great deal of points. You can make up to some or even a great extent with water pools or very long land chains, but you can't win without them. The strategies are not as 'pure' as I ideally would like to see 'em, but I guess you can't have everything. In any case, it doesn't seem to diminish my pleasure playing this title, and seeing someone utilise some other means than the markets to remain in a competitive position is a pleasant confirmation that there [i]is[/i] more to this game than meets the eye. A fun title to play, and a good title to own.

I've played this a few times online.  Very similar to TtD or Go but with less pure logic.  Need to try it out on the family soon.  Complex scoring is going to make it a hard sell though.  Might be a better game for the computer.

Traded Away - January 2009

Never played this with my family.  Not sure they would ever like it anyway (dry point fest).  Problem with this game for me is that if I want to play a game like this, I'd much rather play TtD.  Adding in the card aspect makes it more difficult to execute your plan.

Will still play online.  Just don't want to take up the shelf space for this one.  Fun factor is limited to the board variations that are only available online anyways.

5.30.11 Worried this was going to be a lot harder. Was a lot more simple but a lot of fun. I managed to hit all 10 markets and win by 17 points! Seems to be the next step after gateway. (7.99)

6.25.12 Finally got back to this game. I really enjoy this game and am a bit surprised to find it a good mix of Ticket to Ride and Brass. It's not as complex as Brass and much easier to explain. While I understand the concept of the game and how important the markets are, I still feel I'm learning how to make the rest of the points work the best overall as well. This one will see the table more. (8.72)

RATING: 6
Setting aside the pasted-on theme, this is really an abstract game.  The challenge is to cover spaces on the board strategically using the cards you're dealt, and then the cards you purchase as the game goes on.  Landscape tiles match the board and score points, while the livestock cards are used to surround markets and get you money.

While there's nothing inherently wrong with the game, it just feels too much like other games I've tried and doesn't have a unique hook to keep me coming back for more plays.  Given the choice of a hexagonal tile-laying game with cards, I'd much prefer to play Kingdom Builder.

Rules are quite fiddly: stuff to earn money, stuff to earn points. Tile placement can play Kingdom Builder. Multiple ways to get points can play Castle of Burgundy.

RATING: 5
Not terrible but not much fun either. Build a base, wait for someone to make a move and then make your move for the markets. After the table is more or less full, hopefully your opponents have blocked you less than they have blocked each other.

I don't like how money is so abundant (and ultimately unimportant) in a game that is supposed to reflect a market situation. The theme is as pasted on as they get. Still, it doesn't feel broken in any way and if you like blocking/networking games it might be right for you,

Not as complex as 7 Wonders Duel and somehow better for its mood of quiet picking away and plans. Super, super fun simple game with great artwork and enough gameplay in there to go with its Quilt Show-esque peacefulness. This is Knizia and there is a reason why his games sell. He knows vanilla pleasantness and mock me for saying this but he is better at it than Donald Vaccarino is at designing his style games and perhaps as good at it as Stefan Feld is at buzzing all of our pleasure centers with points. I am very impressed with Knizia overall.

This game destroys the already not so great Castle Merchants, it challenges stiffly Arkadia and wins easily against it. It is a great abstract game. It plays nicely with two players.

RATING: 3
Components: Quality components. Nice artwork on the board, cards, and water tiles. The animal tokens are functional but could be more attractive. The land tiles are unattractive.

Experience: I'm not sure what to make of this game. Between two two-player games, our collective score more than doubled, just from having a better grasp of the rules. At first, the game seemed to be all about using animal chains to make lots of money; but then we found it was all about land chains scoring points and reaching the most markets. The second game seemed to be decided by the luck of drawing the most pampas cards, which allowed for the creation of the largest land chain. The back-and-forth was often tense and satisfying, but both games seemed very lopsided in the scoring, and the outcome clear long before the game was over.

I've only played this on SpielByWeb, where you can analyse till the cows come home without ticking off anybody. In my book, this is like Reef Encounter: I expect playing face to face to be frustrating, as you can't spend long enough working through your options. I probably won't bother playing it IRL, so it loses a couple of ratings points just for that, since I like the social side of gaming too much to play exclusively online.

I like Durch die Wuste, and this game reminds me a bit of that one. Very interesting decisions, but the base rules may lead to a "single best strategy" game. I have yet to try the advanced rules, but I think they'd make for a very different game. Thumbs up!

RATING: 7
Amazingly fun game for a theme that I could not care less about. Take on the role of a rancher and farm animals on your plantation. What I enjoy is the "push you luck" build-up of the board with trying to find the best moment to "cash in". That tension is really quite interesting.

Control landscape chains and animal chains. Outwit your opponents to get more animals to market and to have access to water.

I enjoy this game. It's is easy to teach and the money isn't too tight. Each turn players can choose any combination of three possible actions; Buy Object, Play Card, or Harvest. Playing cards allows placement of tiles. Playing matching Animal cards adjacent to a Markets provides Pesos equal to the length of the chain of tiles that includes animals and markets. There are quite a few other scoring opportunities, but they never become cumbersome. It has some similarities to Through the Desert, but personally, I prefer this game. The art is very nice, although it can be a little difficult to differentiate between the different land cards.

Awesome.  Different scoring options, best kind of card drawing system, happy little animals.  This might become an 8 though, because I think it would be better with some board randomization like Attika.  Big interlocking platters for a board instead of the set setup.

Ick, can't go to 8 because it blows with 5, and my worry is why.  The set setup makes one player out of 5 have more easy land than others.

RATING: 8
Players play South American land owners, claiming, irrigating, breeding livestock and taking them to market.  Players purchase land and animal cards from respective decks, which can be turned into tokens on the hex grid game board.  The idea is to position them to milk victory points out of the game via forming chains of land, and linking livestock to the market hexes on the board.  Bonus points come from irrigation, building haciendas, and hoarding cash.  Feels like a lot of other games (Durch die Wueste, Africa, any Alan Moon game where you draft cards) and entirely unoriginal.  However, it works very, very well and was being played everywhere at Essen in 2005 - even on the floor.  I suspect the economic element where you have to worry about your cash really sets this apart from more average games of similar type.  The two sided game board is a great idea.  Hans im Glueck nails it again.  Update - held up really well over the past 3 years - sees regular table time.

RATING: 8.5
Another Kramer beauty. In addition to my tracked plays I've also played many times on Yucata. The game is almost an abstract game with a theme that is thin but helps connect the mechanics well. At times the two scoring rounds can create a runaway leader, but most times the games still seem quite close.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This one really slipped under the radar!
 
A great action-point game of grabbing turf before your opponents, but you need to keep cash flowing by connecting herds to markets. Turf comes in 6 or 7 types and herds in four, both of which can be drafted.
 
Not any new mechanisms, nor is it sublime or revolutionary in any respect, but it is nonetheless a great little game, I don't expect I will ever rate it lower but I'm not rushing to grab a copy either. 
 
However, it is several steps up from many of its cousins like Attika or K&K.

Egy 4 fős játékot próbáltunk ki. Elöljáróban annyit mondanék, hogy nekem tetszett, de volt aki azt mondta, hogy olyan, mintha már játszott volna ilyen játékkal. Ez bizonyosan így van, hiszen a játék már nem mai, mégis megállja a helyét napjaink játékai között is. A játékban dél-amerikai farmereket alakítunk, akik a lapkalerakós mechanizmus segítségével próbálnak minél nagyobb területet birtokolni, ezzel minél több pontot elérni. Egy terület lapkát úgy rakhatunk le, ha előtte kijátszunk egy előzőleg megvásárolt terület kártyát, s megpróbálunk láncolato(ka)t létrehozni. Az állatlapkákat is hasonlóképp lehet lepakolni, ügyelve arra, hogy a játék alatt minél több piachoz jussunk el. Hiszen ezzel szerezhetünk pénzt magunknak, illetve az elszámolások alkalmával is jó sok pontot tudnak hozni a konyhára. Pénzt még aratás segítségével szerezhetünk, pontot pedig hacienda és tó lapka megvásárlásával  és megfelelő helyre lerakásával (többek között). A játék nem túl sok szabály alkalmazásával elég jó, közepesen komplex, eurogame-s játékélményt biztosít, aminek a legnagyobb hátránya a viszonylag hosszú játékidő, illetve a sok előkészületi és elpakolási idő (ez mondjuk eléggé viszonylagos). Nekünk első alkalommal sikerült 3 órára elhúzni. A játék nem konfrontatív, habár meglehet keseríteni a másik életét, inkább mindenki a saját kis birodalmával törődik. Azoknak a családoknak ajánlom, akik nem riadnak vissza a kissé számolgatós, mégis könnyed stratégiai játékoktól. (2014.09.27.)

Hacienda's biggest drawback is its lack of maps; it desperately needs a modular board.  Once I started playing it on yucata.de, my copy was never able to hit the table any more.  I traded it (along with The Castles of Mad King Ludwig) for Inhabit the Earth in February 2017.

I enjoyed very much my first game of Hacienda. It was a very pleasent surprise.

Havn't played since I got my own copy.

Update: Played with my own copy for the first time and lost by one point.

There are two types of cards in the game. Land cards and animal cards. You do chains with your cards. Land cards on terrian spaces and animal cards at the center of the map, but have to start by a land space.

TRADED.

UPDATE: Played it once again and traded it away. It's not that Hacienda is a bad game -- it does what it sets out to do just fine but it's just so perfectly average a game that I feel like I've played it in dozens of variations before. If I want to play an economic game or an area control game, I have a bunch of better ones. It's just one of those games that have been sitting on my shelf that aren't outright bad but I have so many other games I'd rather play.

UPDATE: I've been thinking about Hacienda more lately and I need to try to get it to the table.

In interesting tile-laying game like Through the Desert, but with a little more self-determinism. Very fun.

This is not a reinvention of the wheel, but a very solid game design by veteran Wolfgang Kramer that has players fight for control of herds, waterplaces and land. The beauty of the system lies in the many possibilities that players have each turn, and the several roads one can follow to achieve victory. Each strategy is equally worthwhile and one has to watch the game closely to see what strategy will be the most succesful in a certain context.  The Hans-im-Glueck edition looks beautiful and even gives the players a variant board in addition, as well as the possibility to create new boards with a program available at our website ar www.westpark-gamers.de, so replayability is very high.

In true Euro fashion there are multiple ways to score points by claiming lands and placing herds.

There's nothing fundamentally new in this game but everything works nicely together.  Create land chains, connect animals to markets and hope that you draw blindly the right cards.  It seems to me that paying extra for the right card isn't always the best course as you telegraph your next moves, although if the right card is available it's worth the extra peso.  I would play again after I've played Through the Desert again to see which I prefer.  Not sure at the moment.

[Tile-laying, set-collection, connection, sort-of-economic] [3P:8,4P:8,5P:8] Kramer's latest big box game (and first solo effort in a while) mixes some familiar elements into a light-medium game that is greater than the sum of its parts. Players are hacenderos aiming to gain control of the choicest spots in the area by purchasing land and grazing rights. Herds of animals brought to market and harvests provide cash. Cash buys more stuff. However, Hacienda does not have a traditional reinvestment engine since the opportunities to market are limited. Here you have the connection/area control element where players can horn in on other players' areas. Direct confrontation in a Wolfgang Kramer game. You have to love it. Finally Hans im Gluck has included a double-sided map to play on. It's too bad that one side (the symmetric dog-bone map) isn't all that interesting. The good thing is that Wolfie and HiG have apparently authorized the Westpark Gamers to release a map generator, which will keep the game fresh. Overall, this is a solid gateway-class light-middleweight game from one of the two Master Ks (the other being the good Dr. Knizia) of Eurogaming. A solid addition to any gamer's library. UPDATE: More play F2F and on SBW. I enjoy Haz. It's relaxing, with enough meat to keep you interested but light enough that it can be served alongside a heavier main course. I'm not really enamored of the scoring variants. The "halftime score" effect is integral to the game especially due to the market strategy. However the ability to create maps will keep Haz fresh. Now wishing for professionally-produced expansion maps a-la Power Grid. Are you listening HiG/RGG? Rating upped from 7 to 8, and I think that's final for this really nice game.

Now one of my favourite games.  Beautiful artwork on the landscape and animal cards.
Two scoring rounds (mid-point and end-game) generate some tension as it's not obvious to work out leaders.

Quite interesting game. It has the feel of Through the Desert since you're really creating chains, but it feels less abstract since you're manipulating money and buying cards. Naturally, it also feels less pure. I would choose between this one or Through the Desert based on by desire to play a pure or a themed game.

Tök jó kis kártyavezérelt lapkalerakós játék. Kicsit hasonlít a Kingdom builderre (vagy inkább fordítva), de ennek valamivel összetettebbek a szabályai és a pontozása.
Két fővel is jól működött, kipróbálnám majd többesbe is. A két főshöz nem lenne rossz esetleg valami kisebb tábla, hogy több legyen a konfliktus, így kicsit magányos építkezés volt.

A fair game based on tile placement and action points but it really didn't inspire me enough to buy it. It felt as though it was the sort of game I had played many times before without having any real spark. Rather dry and lacking in fun but there are many worse games out there.

RATING: 6
Hacienda is a fairly generic mix of card drafting, tile laying and area enclosure. Of course, area enclosure isn't all that common a mechanic, and it encourages being mean: keep your opponents' herds away from the lucrative markets, block access to valuable water holes, and quite generally try to be as  much of a thorn in the backside as possible.

In spite of that the game is still easy-going. In some ways you could think of it as a less restrictive version of Ticket to Ride.

Bought 7/29/06. Played first game 7/30/06. Really enjoyed it as a 4-player. Not bad downtime, but would be a bit worse with 5. Have played it again as a 4 player - and enjoyed it more this time. We played the asymetrical board and enjoyed it a lot. I began to see even more strategy upon my third play. It is getting overlooked - but is a great new game.  

By 2008 - I'm loving it onlilne. This is truly a great little game. It is definitely an 8 with me. One of the better ones, actually.

Purchased first and foremost because it has animals in it, and my girlfriend loves animals (just don't tell her where the animals are going!). This is easy to teach and relatively straight-forward to play. A light, pleasant game, where players have enough choices to strategize but only a few choices are allowed to be taken every turn. This worked well as a two-player game. There is a certain amount of blocking that has to be done, so the combative approach makes it engaging.  Nothing earth-shattering, but a solid game with a number of mechanics (cards, area control, tile placement) that work well together. Seemingly a very tight game as well.

Acquired December 2005. 

As of November 2006 -- We have played Hacienda three or four times and have just begun to get a grasp of good play in it. It could be called a complex version of Through the Desert. There are some similar mechanics and scoring goals, but Hacienda is much more complex. It's an excellent challenge, and I look forward to playing it more.

May 2009 -- We have begun playing this more often lately, and have really enjoyed it. The more we play, the more we learn how to play better (which is natural).

October 2011 -- I continue to enjoy this game. I think it is challenging, mildly confrontational, and fun. There are never enough time, actions, and/or money to do all you want to do on your turn. With the different ways to score, there is a lot of decision-making involved. I believe it is an excellent game.

November 2012 -- Because it's limited to 5 players, we don't get this one out as often as I would like, but when we do, I thoroughly enjoy it.

Excellent game system - nothing too new, but a finely crafted package from the master designer.  Have played with 2, 3 and 5 and worked well for all.  The theme even makes sense.  As we get to know the game more interaction is sure to occur.  Great play reward per time spent ratio, but we have had acouple of games drag as people don't play as many animals as they do land - at least in our group. The dogbone board is only worth playing the once.  Felix Navidad makes a good interactive 2p game.

A solid Kramer game that has elements of different games. I like it fine, but I wonder if the added mechanics really add that much, since I can't help but think that Through the Desert scratches the same itch for me and plays in less time.

I tend to enjoy the building/economic games, so I really like this one. It reminds me to some degree of Amun-Re and Through the Desert, as it possesses aspects similar to both games. As you place land and animal tiles on the board to earn money from getting animals to market, you must also build your train and place tiles strategically to earn points when the scoring round occurs. There are many ways to earn points, so you can work out a strategy that best suits the cards you've been dealt. Purchasing from the face up or face down stacks is also a necessity, as your hand will run short very quickly. Don't spend too much, however, as having a lot of cash in your hand can pay off as well. A very solid building/economic game, one of my favorites.

Simple rules with complex strategy and short player turns that keep the game moving quickly will probably bring me back to the table for years to come.

Hacienda is a mildly interesting game that might have passed muster six or eight years ago, but doesn't shine brightly enough to stand out in today's ludosphere. The most definitive advice I can offer is not to use the dog bone board, which leads to a horribly boring game. Also, use Variant 1, which should have been called the "Advanced Rules" instead of a variant. Without the first variant, long land chains are too dominant, leading to one degenerate strategy and stifling alternative approaches. I'm able to enjoy Hacienda as long as players keep the pace quick. Yes, it's an optimization game, but it's a pretty lightweight optimization game that should clock in at about an hour. Played under ideal conditions (asymmetric board, use variant one, don't use variant two, play quickly) Hacienda rates about a 7 for me. Unfortunately, poor development decisions have made that sweet spot hard to find, so the game must lose at least a point from its rating.

We really enjoy the asymmetrical map on the "back" of the board. It's a nice change of pace and strategy. In fact, after the first few games, we haven't gone back to the "dogbone" side except to teach beginners.

I expected more. The gameplay is very abstract and somewhat dry and saying that the theme is pasted on is not a lie. I did not like the bookeeping you need to keep track of how many points your opponents will get (and how to intercept them before the next scoring). Needs to be longer; make a mistake and you won't be able to catch up. The components are decent. Rating may change after more plays.

I enjoyed it. Compared to Durch die Wuste, it's certainly more interesting, with more strategic choices. But Durch die Wuste has an elegant simplicity - easier to teach and faster to play.

There are a lot of valid strategies, and none seems to overpower the others.  There's a lot of interaction with the other players, and a lot of decisions to make, but the decisions each turn aren't particularly agonizing, so it still goes pretty quickly.  Even though you may plan out a move a couple turns ahead, if someone else makes that move before you, your preparations are generally still useful in a different way, which is great.

Hacienda is an excellent game of tile laying and, in a way, route building. It's mostly a tactical game, as you are constantly reacting to what other players are doing... but lots of opportunity for screwage by blocking people. There are lots of different ways to score points (markets, land, water, haciendas), but connecting your animals to different markets is one of the most lucrative.

Though I've still only managed a few plays face to face, this game really shines on spielbyweb and yucata, where additional maps are available, as the game only comes with a single double-sided mapboard.

Kramer's take on "Through the Desert". It does have a similar feel to that game, with points for water holes, cutting off oponnents' chains, and making connections to key places (markets/oasis). Likewise, there is always more stuff you want to do than your limited number of actions allows, which is a good thing. But it is still different enough, especially for the cards, which restrict what or where you can place. There is also an economic aspect, as you must earn money to pay for what you want to place. Despite the dull theme, the nice artwork adds to the enjoyment.

Solidly designed eurogame that blends tile placement reminiscent of through the desert with ticket to ride's card drafting and set collection.  It is not very thematic.

Good euro though, I would play again.

[Initial Impression: 7]
An area-control game with an economic element.  Players build up areas of land and herds of animals.  Land is good for scoring purposes, while herds provide access to money and can more easily be used to restrict opponents' options.  There is a high degree of confrontation in the game, as you're constantly jockeying for access to markets and to extend the areas you control.  It is very important to focus on getting access to many markets for both scoring and income. The double-sided board is nice, as it gives you the option of playing a "simplified" version with the symmetrical side.  Probably best with 3-4 players, although 2 on the symmetrical side still provides a fun and very close game (although you could theoretically force a draw by mimicking moves).

You are a land owner in South America competing with other players to extend your land & herds as well as bring your herds to market.  This is one of those games where there are lots of different things you can do during your turn so there can be some hard choices.  In that it is a little like Through the Desert, though TtD pulls it off better.  Gameplay can easily get somewhat cutthroat via blocking moves.

Some madmen might tell you that the game is very derivative. It might share some mechanics with well known games, but the end result is very different from its influences. Sure, you might play different kinds of tiles in chains like in Through the desert, and you build stuff using cards from your hand like in Attika or Ticket to Ride, but the built in economic system changes every preconception.

Yet another quality game for the Church of Kramer.

Neat area control type game, that isn't really an area control game. Players score points by playing terrain cards to establish strings of continuous land (farms), and from there play animal cards to establish strings of various herds to touch as many market spots on the board. Cards must be bought with income generated from having herds touch markets, with more money for herds that are based off of larger strings of land. Scoring happens in the first half and second half of the game, with VP being awarded for having land and herds touching water spaces, establishing haciendas on the strings of land, having money, or most importantly, touching as many market spaces as possible (with scoring going up as a Fibonacci sequence). Players must balance between getting income (to buy more cards, haciendas, or water spaces) and establishing area control (for VP). Rules are simple and play is straightforward (very limited decision tree), with many interesting twists due to the randomness of the terrain and animal cards. This game definitely has a Kramer-esque feel due to the mechanics, such as the need to buy cards (reminiscent of El Capitan), and getting pieces out there. Scoring in the variant is reminiscent of Torres (number of animals x number of land tiles touching animals), while simplified in the base game. However, there is very little player interaction or leveraging of position, other than blocking. Still, a good, fast, fun game.

JEM Magazin 20. szám (by fisha):

A körünkben adott 3 akciónkat tetszés szerintisorrendben és kombinációban választhatjuk ki a következők közül: 
Vásárlás: Elsősorban terület- vagy állatkártyát lehet vásá¬rolni. Mindig egy 4-lapos nyitott készlet, amiből választhatunk, vagy húzha¬tunk vakon is a pakliból. Nyitott lapból vásárolni 3 peso, míg a húzás csak 2. Tehát ha valamire nagy szükségünk van, akkor többet kell érte perkálnunk. Ritkábban fordul elő, de vehetünk még itatót és haciendát is. Mindkettő a területeink pontértékét növeli, amire majd visszatérünk a pontozásnál, azonban egyik se olcsó mulatság, 12 peso az áruk. 
Kártya kijátszása: Ez az akció adja a játék alapmechaniz¬musát. Kijátszunk egy kártyák, és a rajta lévő mezőtípus¬nak megfelelő helyre letehetünk egy területlapkát a saját színünkben, ezzel jelezve, hogy ez a terület már a miénk, és senki nem is veheti el azt tőlünk. Állatok esetén csak annyiban más a helyzet, hogy a kártyán lévő állat fajának megfelelő állatot tehetjük le, de azt mindig csak pampára. 

Mindez szép és jó, de honnan lesz pénzünk a következő körökre? 
Likvid tőkénk növelése céljából két dolgot tehetünk: piacra vihetjük az állatainkat vagy learathatunk egy területet. A piacolás automatikusan megtörténik, amint egy állatot leteszünk egy piacot ábrázoló mező mellé. Ilyenkor minden, a piachoz érő egybefüggő egyforma állat- (gyakorlatilag a csorda) és területlapka 1 pesot hoz a konyhára. Azaz ha leteszünk egy marhát egy piac mellé, aminek a csordája 4 tagot számlál, és ez a csorda egy 5 lapkából álló területünkhöz csatlakozik, akkor 4+5=9 pesot zsebelhetünk be. Ha van még hely a piac mellett, akkor ezt akár egy következő marhával is megtehetjük, ekkor már ugyebár 5+5=10 pontért. 
Az aratás a piacolással ellentétben már akcióba kerül, és csak egy egybefüggő területért ad pénzt, állatokért logikusan nem. Ráadásul ezt területenként csak egyszer lehet eljátszani a játék folyamán. Cserébe viszont 3 pesot kapunk mezőnként. 
De mire megy ki a játék? 
A játékot természetesen pontra játsszuk. Két pontozás lesz a játék folyamán, melyeknek az idejét az állatkártyák paklijának elfogyá¬sa határozza meg. A két pontozás teljesen egyforma, a következő¬kért jár pont: 
Pontot kapunk a legalább 3 mezőből álló területeinkért. 
Pont jár a piacokért, amikhez hozzáér a csordánk. Ez me¬redeken emelkedik, gyakorlatilag minden piac annyi pon¬tot ér, ahányadik a sorban. Így egy piacért csak egyetlen pontocskát kapunk, viszont ha mind a 11 piachoz hozzá tudunk érni, akkor 66 pont üti a markunkat. Ha mindezt már az első pontozáskor sikerül megcsinálni, az ugyebár 132 pont. Mondanom sem kell, hogy nagyon fel kell kötni a gatyát ahhoz, hogy ezt elérjük, mivel ellenfeleink nem fogják tétlenül nézni. 
Pontok járnak a fent már említett haciendákért aszerint, hogy hány lapkából áll az a terület, amire épültek. 
Extra pont jár minden olyan területért és állatért, amelyik víz mellett van. 
Ezen felül minden éppen nálunk lévő peso után.

Kategóriájára nézve mindenképp egy erősebb belé¬pőszintű (szaknyelven gateway) játéknak nevezném. Nagy előnye, hogy 2, de akár 5 fővel is élvezetes, illetve hogy a játékideje 45-90 perc között mozog – szóval szin¬te minden társaságban elő lehet venni. Ráadásul az újra-játszhatósága is igen magas, mint minden kártyavezérelt játéknak, amire itt még rátesz egy lapáttal a kétoldalas játéktábla is. Akinek még ez sem lenne elég, az netről le tud tölteni rajongók által készített új térképeket.

This is a great game.  I can't wait to play again.  Medium weight, reminded me of Through the Desert, but more competiting goals.  Home run of a game.

EDIT:
After a few plays, I have to say I much prefer the asymmetric side, and my rating has gone down a bit.  Still a nice game.  There seems to be a programmed way to move with veterans with the set boards the way they are, wish there was a modular system for constructing the board so people would have to plan more rather than act from a script.

First played this on Jan 4th, 2007.  After reading the rules and finding a few mistakes I was concerned that we might run into a snag or two with how the game played.  I was also concerned with the amount of pieces it had as well, making it take a while to setup.  After playing it, it seems that we made it through it ok.  The game was interesting and fun for our lunch group.  The game seems to feature more strategy than luck which is good as well.  After the first play, it we seem to have the rules down where we can better use strategy and pick up the pace.  I'd give them a plus for plastic coating the money, however the animal and land cards are a bit small to shuffle.

Only 1 play, but very enjoyable.  Feels different enough from Through the Desert to me.  (And I actually rate TtD a 10.)

I enjoyed the economic structure, but I even more enjoyed the balance of the scoring mechanics.  I also like the number of variants and the available maps.  We'll see if it can hold the interesting decisions and multiple paths to victory over time.

Very good.  The essence of German style: not too complicated rules, fair amount of interaction between players, elegant mechanics, quite a few ways of scoring.

EDIT: After 10 plays I lower my rating from 8 to 6.  The game has just worn out for me..  It doesn't bring any emotions like it used to do... (and maybe tactical factor is too great for my current taste).
That rating might be unfair, but it just reflects my desire to play this title..

RATING: 7.5
Yet another solid offering by Herr Kramer but yes nothing too original. I never thought of TTD while playing my first game surprisingly enough and due to the fact I like to compare I think that says something. In retrospect I can say that yes it is somewhat similiar but also different enough I have no problem playing both games even back to back. 

The multiple ways to score keep you on your toes as does watching what your opponents are doing. I liked the different choices but not getting a needed card can force them somewhat ergo a dose of luck ensuring you stay flexible. Some don't like the card draft and don't understand the $2 blind vs the $3 face up but I thought it was brilliant. Money adds another element which adds to the multiple paths.

4 or 5 players will be more interactive though the  screwage effect will feel a little chaotic making planning harder as yes there is some nastiness to go around. Less players sees planning easier so you should play a little more agressively (like in E&T) to ensure interaction and to stop your opponents from getting big chains.

I'm always willing to play a multiple scoring game that comes in at 60 - 90 minutes. 

Note: The small cards suck ass and the double sided tiles are extremely annoying and one of the worst component choices ever!

This is the Kramer game that I've been waiting for for a long while. It's no Princes of Florence, dare to dream, and there's nothing particularly new about it but it's still a really good game.  It's plays fast, it's not too complex, and it leaves you with the same feeling that so many of Kramer's games give you, the need to do MORE.

Was okayish, if all a little calculable. Theme felt irrelevant, double sided player tokens seemed cheap for a box this big and at this price. Some of the costings seemed a little arbitrary, too. Good, but not excellent, you'll have played something like this before, and even if not it'll all feel a bit lacking in anything clever or original. Double sided board is a bonus.

Good for an occasional play.  You can build big herds or you can try to connect to lots of markets with smaller herds.  And you have various other options to boost your score based on how the board is shaping up.  And the board is two-sided for variety, with one of them harder to develop well.

I'm not as high on this game as I used to be, even though the board and bits are pretty.  The confrontations seem a little forced, and if people don't buy animals the game can drag on quite a lot.  I prefer to play with the continuous scoring variant, as it can be hard to catch up from a deficit in the first scoring round since everything scored in the first half then scores again in the second half.  If continuous scoring were the standard rule instead of an official variant I'd rate this a 7.

RATING: 10
A game very reminiscent of Through the Desert although it is unique in its own way.  Multiple ways to score make every move critical and, because you are limited to only three actions per turn (a Kramer trademark), there is always more that you want to do.  Do you want to buy more cards, lay tiles or harvest for cash, or just position your pieces to maximise victory points?  It's a tough balancing act.

The symetrical board probably plays best with an odd number of players because it's too easy to mimic your opponent on the opposite side of the board.

Hacienda might be a little abstract for some players (it reminds me of some of Colovini's designs), but it's well worth it... it gets better with every play.  My rating has gone up after repeat plays... this might well become one of my all-time favourites.

The 2-player game is best when played aggressively.

RATING: 7.8
Nothing new in terms of game mechanics, but the ones used go together quite well.  Take equal parts Stephenson's Rocket, Knizia's Africa, Through the Desert, Ticket to Ride and Tikal, and add in a pinch of Goa, stir and enjoy!  Thoroughly!

To explain:

* Stephenson's Rocket: connecting to the markets and cashing in is like connecting a rail line to a black city in SR.

* Through the Desert: walling off areas, and a little bit of the Oasis action, not to mention the placement aspect.

* Knizia's Africa: this one's more of a stretch, probably, and I can't explain it in words.  It just reminds me of Africa, but instead of turning the tiles over you're placing them.  There's still the multiple ways of scoring (and in Hacienda, multiple meanings (money vs. VPs)).

* Ticket to Ride: clearly the card drafting is similar.

* Tikal: decisions around "action A gets me 3 points and better positioning, but action B gets me 6 points, but that's probably all".

* Goa: Even more of a stretch than Africa, I'm sure; I don't know how to explain it, but there's just something about Hacienda that has that hint, an aftertaste, really, of Goa.

None of these games hold an exclusive on these mechanics; they just spring to the forefront of my mind when I think of how to describe Hacienda's mechanics.

Another Kramer title with a heavy spatial component. Hacienda combines an economic element with Ticket to Ride-style card drafting and Age of Steam-style connections / variable maps. You have to build up sufficiently large herds to take to market, but you also have to ensure access to multiple markets across the board, all while trying to contain and cut off other players. I think Hacienda works fairly well for what it is, but it's not really my type of game. I'll play it again if only because it comes in at around an hour.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Use either land cards or animal cards to place land tiles around an outside track or animal tiles that branch off toward markets. Try to hit as many markets as possuble and make the chains as long as possible. Going to market gives cash based on the animal chain length. Cash is needed to buy cards. Adding water tiles adjacent to tiles or a single hacienda onto a land chain increases the victory points. The rules are very simple, but there is plenty of strategy to make this a great game.

RATING: 5
If you can get the most land and your fair share of everything else you should get an easy win. However, going for the most land give other players opportunity to screw you out of other stuff. Simple mechanics combined with difficult choices about the timing of your expansions; this is good, nasty stuff. Just remember, there's no crying in boardgames!(Fewer players = nicer. More players = nastier.) 

I'm rating it only a 5 because I think the market scoring is too dominant, and the multi-player dynamic does not tend to even out very well in that some players are likely to get blocked more often than others. It's enjoyable, but clearly in the "take it or leave it" category for me. Don't need it in my collection but will play if someone else requests it.

RATING: 6
I would say: Through the Desert but with some card randomness thrown in. Players build lines of different animals and try to  conquer as much land as they can. Animals bring you money, but land bring in VP, so players have to balance the economics of the game.

The game works, but after playing so many different incarnations of area-control, I feel that the luck of the draw really ruins the elegance of it. And there are too many rules that you just can't pull out for the occasional quick game.

Playing online, where there are multiple maps easily available, I'd give this a 9.5.  The hassle involved in putting these maps into face to face games takes a small amount from this game, but it is a game that has managed to appeal to my previously dead aesthetic sense; with the building of land / animal herds so that they can best accomodate the water shapes provided!  The tense race to touch markets before they get cut off from you; the need to maximise your score early in the game so that you are in a good position after the half way scoring; and the fantastic start when you get to try to plan out your best position based on the cards you have make this the most fun game I currently play.It's only negative is that you can often see who is going to win from fairly early in the game.  This doesn't stop it being fun to play out, fortunately!

It was very simple to understand with many decisions to choose from. I enjoyed the multiple elements (connection/cutting others off, tile laying, economy vs. scoring victory points) and layers of this game.  The components were quality and colorful and fit the theme well.   Once you get your empire growing, you have a multitude of decisions to make...do you place water holes, haciendas.  Comes with 2 maps, and many more fan made ones to choose and print.  Scales well 2-4(still good with 5) players due to a variety of maps to choose from.Player interaction isn't direct, since all you can do is cut them off, or take a piece they wanted.  Wish there were event cards of a sort, like Mad Cow Disease or Sheep Shearing so you could knock their caravan out and more directly intervene.Luck is kept to a minimum since the only factor is card drawing...which isn't that bad since you can see a face up bank of cards, or draw blindlyScore 12/11/2006: 8

As so often happens a game that burns brightly for a while eventually dims.  I still enjoy Hacienda, but it has slipped a notch for me.  Still, this is  game that offers plenty of strategy and interesting decisions that plays easily in about 75 minutes.

I'm not exactly sure why but I absolutely love this game. It's a fairly simple game and it wouldn't seem like it has great replayability since there really aren't many options. But I just keep playing and playing and playing. It's just fun to build your chains and try to block others. Might not be for everyone but I can't get enough.

Pretty light and fun game, a step up from Carcassonne and Ticket to Ride. My biggest complain about this one is that the 2 maps with the game are really badly designed to accommodate only 2 players. Sadly, I have yet to try the game with more than 2 players.

Very good tile-laying and set-collection game. Construct at least one long land chain to ensure income and to gain points. Make sure to connect to as much markets as possible and build some haciendas. Scoring will be very close, so don't forget the water tiles. Optimisation of the cards and limited actions is crucial.

Not very original (to put it kindly), but an ok game anyway. High in interaction (with five players) and turn angst.

I've owned this sincen Essen 2008 but never came around playing it.
I probably have forgotten the comparisons with through the desert a game I really like.

If you look at it there are some vague comparisons to be made. I say vague because they seem pretty obvious but they aren't.

Scoring works completely different (no biggest groups, No water tiles for everybody to pick up, Oasis score different and for me these are totally different games.

The card draws can have a huge outcome on the game. It seems that way for me.
I have rated this a 7 for now. But I an't see me preferring this over the game it is compared too.
I'll probably play it some more on the Ipad. I can't play ascension all the time...

The main problem I have is the time is lost by scoring every move and paying or receiving money each move.

It will probably shine on boardgamewebsites that deal whith that.

the main similarity for me with Through the desert is that I think it is best with 2.
With three the board can be pretty cramped for 2 players since the player playing third could put himself and P1 or P2 in a difficult spot right from the start.

the  way scoring works that problem would only be bigger because if the first set of animal cards are gone. The first round scores are doubled.

In an abstract game like this I like more balance.
 writing this down I have to  downgrade my rating. I'll give it a 6 for now. I'll give it a few chances more on the Ipad.

My wife bought this from our Essen-trip 2005. Played many times, and it's true that there are anything new in Hazienda (not an unique game) BUT everything has made well. In every round you have three action points, but how to spend them? You can get victory points many different ways which makes game also very interesting. Only little "problem" is, that the map is a bit too big: if there are only 3-4 players there are too much space and there aren't enough competition. With 5 players the game is great.

It looks a lot like through the desert, but it's a bit easier to visualize since there is no pastel colors.

I did not like the game that much. The thing which is the most weird is that in my game every player ended with the same score except we who had 3 points more.

We also had various ways of playing. People were concentrating while I was spread in 3 different areas. (I even thought I was not in the lead)

But it seems that since the game rewards multiple things, everybody ends up with approximately the same score whatever you do. So it's very hard to compete for something and make sure that it really has an impact at the end of the game.

So you just play the game, the game ends, and somebody wins but it's not some particular moves that made the player win.

RATING: 7
A moderately simple game which underlies it's multiple VP paths and tactical depth.  There's nothing new here with regards to "Euro game mechanics" but the combination produces an excellent game filled with tension as you hope what you want to do is still available on your next turn.  Need to try all the different various scoring methods in the rules (ie- basic vs. advanced).  I recommend teaching it with the first variant but try not to overwhelm casual/light gamers.

Typical Euro complete with largely irrelevant theme laying over a interesting abstract game engine that forces players to optimize their three actions per turn while purchasing and laying tiles of various sorts on the board.

I found it highly engaging, after the setup which is really fast, you start taking quick turns, the game can go from a multiple solitaire to a bloodbath, you have to balance your actions to get points in different tracks, no one track alone will give you victory, it's very easy to play, has a deep tough strategy, similar to Catan, comes from W. Kramer, a very good designer.

It's an area control train game! Who knew.

This game is an [i][b]Oozer[/b][/i], so works well for those who shun spacial awareness games. I don't have that problem, but my wife does.

That the different player colors and critter types are on the BACK of each other's chits detracts immensely, and would normally detract from the game's rating but I don't have the heart to do that.

NUMBER OF PLAYERS NOTE: Don't forget to REMOVE 30 CARDS for 2 player games! Stupid game otherwise. And remove the correct number for other players - there is a 'setup summary' table that includes information that is not spelled out in the rules and is easy to overlook.

RATING: 7
Got it for my birthday (summer 2011), it is a considered and contemplative game, with many small moves making up your total progress for the game. You claim land, raise herds, which you drive to market for sale. Within that description are the several different ways to score points - via claimed land, the number of markets you can be connected to, plus you can buy haciendas and water holes, the placement of which give more points. The animals bought act as a timer on the game, for when the first stack of animals is done, there is a mid-game scoring, then a final scoring when the second stack of animals is gone.

So there are a lot of things to think about. However, the game is dependent on a good board layout and there are two in the game box, a symmetrical dog bone shaped one and a more asymmetric one 

We had some fun learning the basics on the dog bone but found it lacked something. I read on here that the asymmetric board was better for 2 players and I have to say that was what we found also. With the dog bone, the game is all about the markets (which score by a triangular progression, so the 5th one you buy is an extra 5 points, the 6th one 6 more points, etc). The one who linked to the most won and only if you managed to keep that even would the rest of the game matter so much. In the asymmetric version that is less true (my wife overcame a 4 market deficiency to win!) and that makes for a much more interesting game as the whole game matters than.

We played only the one multi-player game but as it was basically a teaching game I didn't really get to see how it plays. It has been rather lost in the shuffle.

Wow.  Great game.  So many ways to score points.  Limiting the number of actions forces effective and efficient action choices, but the game doesn't feel terribly tight, as in, you don't feel afraid you'll loose the game early by making one bad choice.

Hacienda has one of those themes that really works for me. Owning a ranch and herds of animals is certainly a lot different experience but I could really relate the mechanics with the theme here which made it a lot more fun. Tons of decision making to do and players have some control over the speed of the game. I'm very happy with this title.

There are plenty of options each turn and many times you wish you could do more than your three actions especially towards the end of the game.  The more players you play with - the more cutthroat this game can get.  However, being cutthroat is not a requirement to play this game well.  You also have to consider the timing of ending the rounds - if I don't end it now, am I hurting myself or the others more?

I wasn't that impressed with my first play, but later reflection and another play have increased my liking of the game.

There are several ways to expand your territories, and the game can get vicious and mean, which makes the group love it!

This is a good one.  It's like Ticket to Ride with much more to think about and more options on each turn.  Be careful not to make too much money even if you have a great opportunity to do so.  At the end of the day you want to have spent your money on things that will bring in the points.

NOTE: Make sure you notice the difference between the instruction booklet and the scoring summary card.  One says haciendas score land "AND" animals, the other says "OR".  It's "OR."  Only the group that the hacienda is on counts.

Enjoyable connection game, in the vein of Through the Desert but with an economy, as money is needed to buy cards and cards are needed to build land and animal tiles. You gain money by connecting animals to markets, which also scores you points.

The game is good with two players, but would be better with one of the tighter custom maps. The map that comes with the game is likely best with 3 or 4 players.

This is an excellent game, a very good surprise of Essen 2005. This game is right up there in the same range as Java, Tikal and Torres. If you like those games, you'll love this one too. This is yet another landscape that you're creating and meanwhile you try to optimize your points, while at the same time trying to block your opponents. There are many different ways to score points and there are several different strategies to pursue. There is a lot to this game. It plays rather light, but it should not be underestimated. Always play the asymmetrical board and especially with fewer players: play it agressively. Block market access for others and don't let people get away with long chains of land. Check this game out.
And really when you take a good look at the game, besides placing animals in a row as one of many options, it doesn't have that much to do with Through the desert. There is a lot more to this game: there is a money layer and there are more ways to score points, so the game play is different too.

Decent little game, although not very much about it that's memorable. It reminds me of Alhambra and Carcasonne in terms of gameplay: there's some strategy and interesting decisions but little tension throughout the game. It also gets somewhat repetitive as nothing really changes from round to round. But having said that, it's a fun game to play, especially for a change of pace. Not one I'll suggest very frequently, but I can see us pulling it out every once-in-a-while.

There's so many different ways to score (Water, Haciendas, land chains, market access, and cash). You have time to go for all of them while focusing on 1 or 2. I think I won because I acquired 12 of 18 horses in the deck. I got about 139 cash from these which enabled me to buy lots of good stuff. 3 actions per turn seems pretty awesome. What other games have 3 per turn? A terific game. 

Land chains and market access seem like the best things to focus on.

Kramer has done it again!  There'a a good mix of comfortable mechanics (nothing new) & scoring opportunities, cool animal (herd) tiles & a theme that fits the game play pretty well.  I love the turn angst (hoping players won't screw you over) & there are some real strategic & tactical choices to make. An AP game without too much AP (!?)  This one will see repetitive plays.

RATING: 6
I like it, but maybe not as much as I'm supposed to? It has some nice tension, extend your land chains vs. block your opponent, etc. But when a game is this high scoring, it tends to muddy the relative importance of any one move. And I know I just bumped Through the Desert up to a 10, so what am I saying, but there I feel like "playing well" translates into "good score", and here I'm just not as certain.

Also seems to on occasion extend far beyond the interesting part. Don't like the ending condition.

I really don't see why I'd ever want to play this again over Through the Desert, which is much more streamlined and clear. Hacienda is just a bloated version and the pure strategic essence from Through the Desert is lost.

RATING: 7
I like the tension between building up your economy to make really big profits and moving quickly before you're blocked. One issue I have is that on more than one occasion I've been stuck with a large number of the same kind of land card in my initial hand and even in subsequent draws. That makes it impossible to create a large land chain and limits your options even for going to lots of market connections around the board.

RATING: 8
A good game that neatly combines earning money (by laying tiles to bring animals to market) with scoring points (by building land tiles and other elements), but in which the decisions are not easy.  There are many ways to score points on the board, all of which are based on placing land or animal tiles in a given hex; since only one player can occupy a hex (and once a hex is occupied its ownership never changes), this creates much complexity as players can block each other and cause much havoc.  Point scoring occurs twice during the game at known (but only somewhat easily predicted) times, leading again to complex strategies.

RATING: 6
I think 5 might be my favorite player count here, since it provides enough chaos and competition to challenge my usual "land card grab" strategy. With 4 it's fine, but a little too easy to dominate the game this way. 3 becomes quite a drag, and 2 was the reason why I traded the game away after only a few plays. With the 5 player limitation and a pretty strong standard strategy, this game drops from its recent surge in my interest back down to its original rating.

Note that despite the fairly simple rules and short playing time, the non-intuitive scoring makes this a gamers-only game.

Somehow different than what I was expecting. 

Combines a lot of stuff from Through The Desert and Attika. Actually, it's pretty hard to pinpoint much of anything not already present in those games.

Hmm. Will need to play more to figure this out.

Hacienda was... okay. The game itself was fine -- it had a little bit of a Carcassonne-like feel to it, placing tiles on a shared map. But I didn't really feel like it did anything new or different. None of the mechanics really grabbed me.

In addition, I played it 2P. I know quite a few people don't recommend Hacienda as a 2P game. It's true that a lot of tension is lost when there's not much competition for areas of the board, and that was true in the game I played. That said, I'm the kind of person who thinks that Ticket to Ride works well enough as a 2P game. The map on Hacienda felt even more open/less competitive than in Ticket to Ride.

Still, I liked it well enough to play it again at any player count (despite the fact that I lost by 9 points). I'm just not sure how often I'd choose to play this game over something similar that I enjoy more.

This looked like an interesting system during my first few games. After settling into an understanding of the rules, I'm beginning to enjoy it, but I'm doubtful about its replayability after about 10 games. 3-player on the "dogbone" seems a bit underwhelming.

Another game first played at UK BayCon 2006 and yet another taught by an excellent teacher/player.  I won my first game by a pretty convincing margin, but have to admit to being lucky in starting to build in an un-contested part of the board.

Goes down well with most of my group and we have some pretty strong players and hence competative games.  Good opportunity for opponent screwage, which we like!

An interesting melding of Kingdom Builder and Through the Desert, but I have to admit that I was the least enthusiastic about this one. This seems to have all the aspects I dislike about both games, and none of what makes those games interesting. That isn't to say I didn't enjoy Hacienda. I like the idea of building up a point generation engine, but one of the things I dislike in games most is scoring once or twice over the course of the game. I like seeing how everyone is doing as the game goes along, and you don't get that here. I think those who want a breezy game with some money management should find something to like here. Just don't expect the theme to shine through much at all.

RATING: 7
Hacienda is a mix between Through the Desert and Ticket to Ride. Place land and animal tiles to connect to markets but to do that you need to play cards and to get cards you need to pay money and to get money you need to... place tiles. The two other games may be more elegant and straight-forward but the agonizing decisions and cutthroat interaction make Hacienda a good game by its own merits.

Update: Sold because Through the Desert provides a similar game experience in less time.

RATING: 6.5
In 19th century Argentina, players are building up their animals herds, connecting to markets and lakes. On their turn, a player has these choices 1) buy land or animal cards, 2) play animal or land cards, 3) harvest, 4) buy lake or hacienda. Animals allow one to connect to markets, with more points awarded to the more markets you connect to, and land tiles score double the adjacent land tiles that you have. There are two scoring phases, when the animal card deck runs out, scoring occurs. It's not a bad game, I'm just conerned that turn order is important, since in a 5 player game, the first players seem to have an advantage in staking out territory.

An abstract in sheep's clothing, . . . or was that pig's, or . . . anyway.  The various scoring mechanisms and limited resource management make this area control game a little more complex than most.  I'd have to play it a few more times to determine whether the increase in mechanic complexity adds to the strategic and tactical depth of the game, or whether the complexity just give you more to do during your turn.  I'll look to play this again soon.

A strategic game that tests spacial reasoning. It has an abstract feel, and doesn't feel euro. The specific flavor of abstract is like Tigris and Euphrates in that you're trying to expand your area of tiles toward certain points on the board. Many possibilites for scoring points; it'll take a few plays to get a sense of them all.
-------
Second play, and it's just a wide open abstract game--one with merit, but really not my cup of tea. There are just so many ways to go on one's turn, it feels rudderless, and then there's the luck of the draw factor.

Classico gioco di piazzamento. L'interazione è elevata (specie in 4 o 5) visto il tabellone non troppo ampio; anche la componente fortuna fa la sua comparsa nella pesca e distribuzione iniziale delle carte. L'ordine dei giocatori è altrettanto determinante; i primi giocatori hanno un piccolo vantaggio nel poter piazzare liberamente le proprie pedine mentre l'ultimo giocatore ha il grande vantaggio di conoscere in anticipo o spesso decidere quando chiudere la prima parte della partita (e passare alla fase del calcolo dei punteggi) e la fine del gioco. Questo permette di valutare come gestire le sue tre mosse al meglio. Le partite risultano molto veloci e sbrigative, lasciano quasi l'amaro in bocca per non essere riusciti a far tutto quello che si voleva, al tempo stesso però rendono il gioco snello e godibile. Buoni i materiali, anche se alcuni terreni tendono a confondersi. Nel complesso un gioco (di Kramer!) da provare che credo non lascerà delusi.

I'm not a big fan of Wolfgang Kramer's previous "action point" games e.g. Tikal and Java always felt more like hard work than fun, they had too many action points and too many things to spend them on. Hacienda is simpler with only 3 action points per player turn and just enough different things to spend them on to make it interesting. I like this.

A solid game that makes me nervous when there are more than 3 players.  It is extremely easy to screw someone in this game, but in the bad way.  A good game will allow a person to screw others and not get screwed back through intelligent play.  In this game, squashing the leader is very simple regardless of what the leader does.  In a 3 player game the game is manageable; any more than that and the most popular player at the table (who understands the game) will win.

Edit: Bringing this up a bit, because the decisions sometimes are just really really good.

RATING: 8
We've seen different strategies win ... connect to 10 markets, nothing but land and haziendas, one land / one herd and water. So there are different approaches you can take, and these I think get more or less decided by what the other players do, combined with your starting hand.

You can make a comparison to Durch Diw Wuste - markets are oases, land is blocking off areas. But I think it's really a two-steps-more-complicated Ticket To Ride. In the main, you pick up cards, then you play them to the board. The first step of complication is the money - you have to earn money to buy more cards. The second step is the multiple scoring avenues - markets, land, haziendas, water, gold. You can follow slightly different strategies in both games (big routes vs multiple tickets ... big land vs multiple markets). But essentially it's the same process ... pick up cards, play to the board to gradually build up your routes / herds and increase your score through the game ... and hope that people aren't competing in the same areas / routes as yourself.

It has the same "occasional tension" that TtR generates - you might get hosed and you may need to plonk something down earlier than you want. But it doesn't have the same 'perpetual tension' that DdW has where every turn requires you to go in 4 different places and you know you can only do 2.

In summary, a solid and engaging game. If I was motivated, I'd generate and print off some more maps using the tools that are out there somewhere, but it doesn't come out quite enough to warrant the energy.

Traded in at alphaspel 

***

Bumping this down a notch. I still like it very much, but it's only fun to play when players are challenging each other - and many that I tried it with seems to think it's bland.

Hacienda lacks some punch - as I wrote before you never feel you are making decisive or potentionally devastating moves.

***

An underrated little game. Just slightly on the dry side, but the theme still fits perfectly. There is a lot going on in all this tile- laying and card-collecting goodness. You get a lot of components in this rather full packed box that comes with a really nice insert where everything fits just right in. 

Rules are not that complex at all, but the game is quite confusing at start. It takes a few sessions before you start to play well. It is a strange game - you often think that you're doing quite well, but the last scoring can brutally show you that you really were 40 points behind the leader. There is room for some direct interaction and blocking of the opponent, although a game of Hacienda never feels agressive. 

There are always a lot of moves to do, but sometimes you just don't know if one move is better than another. Of course, you'll have to play as efficient as possible and don't end up with too many unused land- or animalcards. Nevertheless - I seldom feel I am making any really decesive moves in a game of Hacienda. That is my only concern.

A game of Hacienda is always pleasant.  

Best with 4 players and good with 3. Excellent replay value.

Game doesn't seem too variable with setup and maps and feels a little repetitive with the actions.  Larger number of players seems to fill the board quickly.  Scoring/cash was a little fiddly.

Played it once with full number of players. I was surprised how full the board became. I was doing badly because my own newbieness: I put my starting point at the corner and didn't get into very good position. 
I'd sure like to try the game with less players and make my final judgement after that!

I found myself comparing this one to "Durch die Wuste", but with some additional twists: ability to place haciendas on your series of herds, positioning spatial water bodies (similar to the mosaic tiles of Cleopatra) to best accommodate your herd, and also acquiring land / terrain to help to support the herd. Somewhat difficult to know which strategy to pursue, but first play seemed to reveal that there might be many paths to victory. The harvesting option (for additional money) seemed superfluous to the game, and artwork on the land tiles was hard to match with the associated cards. But in the end, a nice overall mix of gaming mechanics.

Large board needs 4-5 players, there's just too much space for 2-3 players. With 5 players game breaks, if everybody tries to build long land chains. That's because then animal cards will never run out. So the game is definitely broken.

Hacienda adds financial, card drafting and card playing layers to Through the Desert gameplay, so a turn involving 3 actions does feel labourious compared to the streamlined play of 2 camels. The same grumble can be said for the scoring, for in Hacienda there is also a "half time" score to interrupt the flow. I can see some of the charm of Hacienda: there are many conditional elements to consider-you need to monitor and collect terrain cards, there is the scarcity of animal types and you have to manage your income in order to progress. So there is a level of speculation and frustration that is tolerable, and various maps to print off ensuring refreshing replayability. Overall, I think this fiddly, but more interesting and tense competition in the pampas has a slight edge over Knizia's dry desert drama.

Another decent light/medium game by Kramer. Nowhere near the same level as his El Grande or Torres, but good. No innovative new mechanics, but a well rounded game overall. Some elements of the game have remote similarities to Through the Desert and Oasis. But not as tactical, strategical, or tense as Through the Desert. It is certainly not luck-free as that game either. I see four notable weaknesses in the game: 1) Luck of the drawn (or face up) cards. Draw Pampas cards and you gain a fair advantage over opponents. 2) Chaos. With 4-5 players by the time the turn gets back to you the position could have changed to the point of rendering your plans irrelevant. 3) Limited strategies. The primary strategy by far is to quickly connect to as many markets as possible. 4) The gameplay is susceptible to kingmaking.
But still the game is enjoyable and finishes in under 2 hours.

This is a fun, quick playing game where you spend coins to buy cards that you can then later play to bring your tiles into the board. The general idea is to link your tile chains to the markets printed on the board and have your tiles be next to water when possible. It's very clever, and has intelligent choices to be made while not making the game overcomplicated. The graphic design of the game leaves something to be desired though.

Seemed a bit unfinished based on one play. The money was immaterial throughout the first half of the game and the land tiles ran out during the second half of the game (making for some undesirable fiddling while we flipped over played tiles in search of a substitute for the player's color).

A blend of card placement with card drafting and hand management to determine which tiles can be placed.

Several factors in scoring as you try to chain sets of the same animals and land tiles together to connect to markets and access to water. So there is enough factors to juggle to make it interesting.

Agree with the folks to use variant 1 to make land tiles less dominating.

RATING: 5
Game plays much faster than I expected. Personally, not my kind of game. I don't like games with a lot of ways of scoring.

A bit tough to block opponents without postponing advancement of your position, a feature common to a lot of Euro-games, and a feature I don't particularly like.

It's also a resource management game, in which you have to balance between buying and placing tiles on the board, something I don't like because it. Although it adds tension to the game, it also slows down the development of the board. In other words, it's much more gratifying to place tiles on the board than to buy cards -- and I'd rather spend my time playing tiles all the time! That's why I find Through the Desert more gratifying!

UPDATE: Dropped it down from a 6 to a 5. Despite the many ways of scoring, the game really feels scripted! The steps to win:
[1] Build a huge chain on land hexes.
[2] From these hexes, connect to markets to get loads of money
[3] With all that money, you have, stock up on haciendas and water!

Added tip: Try to hoard as many pampas cards as possible! It enables to you cut off markets from your opponents!

Of course, with this strategy, your opponents should be smart enough to block you way early. But usually, your opponents will be too greedy and busy building their chains on land hexes to bother you too much!

RATING: 8
Based on half a game so far, I thought that Hazienda was being unfairly compared to Durch De Wuste; by buying/drafting the tiles you lay and the land you lay them on, it has more layers than the more simplistic DdW (not that "simple" implies lack of depth - I don't want the International Go Federation on my back).  Could go up or down at this point.

A very peaceful game with beutyful components. It's almost impossible to screw your opponents, so for those who enjoy that kind of entertainment, this game is better to avoid. Some calls this game a Through the Desert +, and there is some truth in this sentence. I like the original better...

The first time I played this, I went for a "connect to as many markets as possible" strategy, which was nice, because it freed me up to block other people, but I still got owned in the end.

The second time I played this, I was the only one buying the plains cards whenever they were up.  Towards the end of the game, I had 7 of those that I had accumulated over the course of the game, and I went on a tare and ended up kicking everyone's ass.

I like the game, but I'm not sure it's really bringing much new to the table.  Guess I'll have to play a few more times.

This game has some good elements to it and is quite easy to learn.  A bit abstract but has a good economic element to it too. if your looking for a resource management game this is not for you.  There seems to be a distinct advantage to the second player if playing with two as the rules are writen.  Either player should be able to end the round on there turn.  This game looks like it could be a lot better with more than two.

This game flows nicely as players take fairly quick turns executing a few actions. There's genuine competition for spaces on the board, but overall it's not confrontational. It does resemble Through the Desert in feeling, in that there are multiple ways to earn money and/or points, and usually several spots on the board that need tending to, but you have too few actions to accomplish everything. Otherwise, the comparison is superficial, and both games are worth having for their own merits.

A few actions each turn, but a nice diversity of choices for those actions.  While this might bog a game down, Hacienda doesn't seem to suffer that way as games are played relatively quickly.  The quick play adds to a nice time pressure to the game as players try to gain their points.  But one needs to also generate income to afford actions in future turns.  Individually, the parts might not seem original, but the initial plays reveal a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.

--Jul2011-- Pretty primal game of squeezing delta-points out of actions.  The money subsystem nicely constrains things without getting in the way too much; the board placement appears nontrivial; the decisions are interesting.  Yet there isn't much arc to the game, except for the momentary tweaks as players jostle to line up appropriately for one of the two scorings.  It could improve with further play; equally, it could languish in the pool of perfectly adequate euros after a few more plays:  at this point I can't tell.

RATING: 6
I really like the concepts in this game and I love the economy of actions that Kramer is so good at creating.  I always find myself wishing I could take two turns back to back.  However, I find that the randomness of the card draws forces players to stick with strategies that might fizzle out.  In my couple of plays it seemed to me that the scaling Marketplace score was unbalanced as only about 2 players can compete to connect a majority of them...  and switching your tactics to stop someone from connecting is counter-productive.
Nothing I need to own.  Would play again.

This game is very mechanically sound - player choices are varied and allow for freedom to experiment and adapt. The only problem I had with this game was the intensely dispassionate, disconnected scoring system - everything is so heavily abstracted into a numerical value that I lost track of the significance of what I was doing. I understand that this is the scoring methodology for untold numbers of "Euro" games, and I usually appreciate such systems. Unfortunately, Hacienda's scoring system involves a number of different elements, all of which somewhat intermingle; yet they each have different individual valuations that can't be assessed at a glance. It just seemed murky and required too many repeated re-counts.

The game is more balanced that it appeared at first glance. After one player won by just building terrain tiles and haciendas that became the base point target to beat by using an animal building or most market connection strategy. I'm encouraged to try the game over and over now, testing the different methods of earning points. That's a sign of a good game to me. (It'll also play quite differently with different player numbers.) The game moves at a quick pace and the rules are nice and simple. Gone up in my ranking. Four players seems to be the best balance between competition for space on the board and a quick pace, but it plays well with three or five as well. Games tend to be about each player attempting to hinder their opponent while at the same time optimising their scoring - what many games do I suppose, only in this one it seems more blatant than in others.

I didn't really care for this game. It shares some aspects with Through The Desert, but adds a variety of scoring methods. Maximize your points. Minimize your opponent's opportunities. Block other players. The whole time I was playing this I just felt I'd rather be playing TTD. I only played one game and it was on Leon's custom map, so I really need to play this again to be sure of my rating. The whole "paying for cards" aspect kind of annoyed me. (They're CARDS man, cards should be free!!) Through reckless play it is possible to run out of money, cards, and harvesting; which would leave you passing your turn until everyone else finished.

Reminds me of Through the Desert, in terms of having a bunch of different networks snake around the board. I don't know, feels very loose to me, since the board is huge, the cash is ridiculous, and you get 3 actions a turn.

It's just a super-loose design, that encourages players to explore (heck, it even encourages custom maps), much like a game like Go. Not so interested in exploring it, however.

RATING: 7
This game reminds me a lot of Through the Desert -- there is always so much more to do than you really have time to do.  For me, though, proper play in this game is not quite as intuitive as in TTD.  I think that is because of the much greater number of things you can do on a turn.  I would say there are more varied ways to score, but I don't think there really are -- it just seems to feel that way.  There are currently quite a few more options to explore as far as play of the game goes, which is exceedingly promising.  It doesn't hurt that this game plays in under an hour.  2/22/2007

Great abstract game.  Like Through the Desert on some kind of designer drug.  And now fortified with Pigs !!  After repeated plays during the last three months, I have raised my rating.  Hacienda gets better the more you play it.  A brilliant design.  I hope this one doesn't end up floating above the sonar.  "One ping, Vasily.  One ping only !!"

Hacienda -- Played once; four-player.  Fast moving.  Money was refreshingly spendable.  Luck was mitigated by variety of scoring mechanisms.  For example, if you don't manage to develop a herd, then connect to more markets.

RATING: 7.5
Very tight card collection and tile placement game where you expand your ranch (=hacienda). It's one of my wife's favorite games.

After some unclear rules about the scoring and end-game conditions, we have actually figured it's quite important to let all the players play the same amount of turns, otherwise the starting player is a huge advantage.

We play mostly 2p and having a long chain of lands seems to be a strong strategy especially on the basic map as blocking is very rarely worth it.
The game gets more interesting with more players and on more variable maps.

With a small child at home we do not play as often now, because the game takes a lot of space and has a lot of small chits. And there are other games that are easier to setup and clean up for an evening game.

For now I only give this game a 5. There are 2 sides to the board. One side (the only one I have played thus far) is very simple to win with if you know the rules well. The other side of the board will determine if I rank it higher but i have not played it yet.

At first look, a fine game with many paths to victory, but those tend to degenerate to a couple of best methods after a few plays. It's still an interesting game with connectivity fun and a nice balance of resource issues, but not quite as amazing as it looks at a first play.

RATING: 8
Plays quickly for the amount of strategy involved.  Multiple viable paths to victory make this interesting, especially when there are enough players (4-5) to force lots of player interaction.  The "advanced" non-symmetrical board is much more interesting the the basic one.

RATING: 7
[25 plays] 5, 4, and 3 player games. I made some strategic blunders in each early play, but I still really liked the mechanics of this game. The theme and the artwork are fun as well. 

Good game. I'll happily play whenever the group is in the mood, but if I get the pick, I'd probably pick Tikal, Torres, or Mexica over this one. Turn order, cards available, and card draw are all lucky factors that can have a significant impact on the outcome beyond the player's control - that is why although I enjoy this game on SbW, I don't rate it higher than 7.

Most recent play Sept '15.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Kramer has again reworked a Tikal/Java type system and made it lighter and faster paced. This time, players have 3 actions and money to spend each turn. Starting with a hand of terrain and animal cards, players are trying to play the cards to place either land tiles or animal tiles in order to score points and money.

Choices aren't overly agonising: one is trying to balance money to get cards and special effects (think water scoring from Java from example) and trying to get tiles and animals on the board to score VPs.

The game plays fairly quickly (players dicate how quickly the game ends) though things can get competitive with 4/5 players. Sometimes, moves are pretty obvious and overall, the package works but feels rather mechanical and uninspired.

Good game, although another "Frankenstein's Monster" game with some elements of "Through the Desert", card drafting like TTR and other mechanics that feel familiar. This keeps getting played because of the enjoyable middle-weight strategy level. A winner - and beautifully reproduced on Spiel By Web.

Defintely rated a 10 on the web (with variant maps). 

At first glance ... or play, this game seems to fall on the simple side. BUT ... with the enormous breath of map choices on www.spielbyweb.com I have grown to find the beauty in this one. A perfect game for play-by-web. One of my most played games. Fun strategy and countless maps add freshness to the game.

[BGCOLOR=#FFFF00][COLOR=#000000]Family.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] 3-5p, 90m.

Hand Management, Economic, Tile-laying, Connection. We all really enjoyed this (5p at BGG.Con 2006). Great middle-weight game about placing land tiles and animal tiles to form chains and herds. Everything yields either money or VP; VP wins the game, but you need money to do the things that generate VP. Simple but with plenty of choices as you expand your tiles across the board, competing for space and connections with opponents. Added this to my wishlist.

UPDATE: got it and introduced some others to it, who all liked it (including my wife). Great middleweight game, though perhaps a tad too complex to be a new gamer's first Euro.

Final Update: still enjoying this game a lot. I've got 45+ plays on SpielByWeb as well as what's logged here. This game is a classic for me.

Have only played online.  I think this game is best online for a few reasons - multiple maps, and no clean up.  I think SBW has the best maps and overall implentation.  Yucata's version is good too, but I think having each player's score available at all times is a little "easy".  Very fun game.

The person who taught it to me said that it was essentially "Ticket to Ride with farm animals."  To me it felt more like Through the Desert.  Water tiles and hacienda markers can be worth quite a lot of points.  I'm not sure I like some of the other scoring calculations.  As in Key Harvest the hexagonal fields make the theme seem a bit inappropriate to me.

Szép kivitelezésű, sok anyagot tartalmazó játék, aminek a dobozelrendezése is rendben van. A játékosok parcellákat építenek és állatokat terelnek a kétoldalas tábla valamelyik felén. A parcellák termelése és az állatok vásárba juttatása révén tudnak pénzt szerezni, amiből újabb parcellákat és állatokat tudnak szerezni, plusz tavakat és haciendákat építeni. Kicsit Át a sivatagon, kicsit lapmenedzselős játék. A bajom vele a szerencse szerepe. A lapok feljövetelét próbálták a készítők úgy szabályozni, hogy mindig vannak látható lapok, sajnos azonban még így is soknak éreztem szerencse szerepét. Egyértelműen a nem szimmetrikus táblaoldal a jobb választás és talán 4-5-en jön ki jobban a játék kiszorítós lényege. Érdekes volt az is, hogy kb. ugyanolyan stratégia mellett elég nagy különbségek lettek a végén a pontszámokban. Nem rossz játék, de engem nem győzött meg elsőre egy 3 személyes játék alatt.

Nice.  There is nothing new here.  Really.  That said, I feel that Kramer took what was already out there and made something truly wonderful.  There are a ton of options for scoring, and as much as you are behind in one area, there are many different options to catch up in others.  Fantastically diversified, without being confusing, or overwhelming.

Sure, its got a little Through the Desert and Ticket to Ride, but I feel it is vastly superior to both games.  Plus, what other game has you bring your horses to slaughter.

I recommend playing on the asymetrical side as opposed to the "bone" board.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Ah, Mr. Kramer, you and your action points. There's a lot going on in this area-control, but it feels hard to do anything exciting except when you happen to beat an opponent to certain critical squares. According to reports, this is even worse on the provided maps when not playing with the full 5 players. "You can provide your own maps" is no excuse; the job of the game designer is to make it work out of the box.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating after only one play.  I liked this more than Tikal, of course I won, so that helps with my opinion.  It just seems more streamlined than other, similar games; all the extra not-so-cool stuff has been sliced away, leaving only the cool center.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I really liked this one.  Played a five-player game on the "dogbone" side of the basic map, and the game played out very well.  I like that there are many choices for a player to make, and the game allows players to play the game cutthroat.  After one play, it goes on my "to buy" list.
----
Hmmm, after a second play, my rating drops a bit.  Played the other side of the board, and the game seemed quite unbalanced.  Seemed really like the first player had a high advantage, and the scoring broke down exactly in player order.  Perhaps a rotating start player would help.  I think there is perhaps a bit too many points to be made by connecting to multiple markets -- basically the first player claimed some land in the middle of the board and was able to connect to four markets right off the bat with just a few animal drops.  He and the second-position (and second-place) player were also able to connect to nearly all the markets, where the following players were able to connect to fewer as the available spaces dried up.  I disagree that someone says the last player has an advantage because that player can make scoring happen by buying up animals.

This game reminds me of Through the Desert, but it is far more fun. The multiple avenues to victory points and the competition for position keeps this game lively. I also like the fact that I felt like I could do most of the things I wanted to. In many other Euros, there aren't enough turns or funds to do half of the things you're allowed to do.

RATING: 9
I think this game is underrated. Sure, it's not particularly new or innovative, but it plays great. My only criticism is that the poinst scored at the first scoring round are effectively doubled. So, for example, if you are 4 points behind after the first scoring round you have to get 8 points just to catch up.

Great game for family for sure.  All can play and have a crack at winning with just the basic rules and "dog bone" side of board.  Random board-side and variants will make the game more fun for gamers. I like this game more than the average BGG rating probably because I lived in Paraguay for 2.5 years and spent time in Argentina and the Patagonia region.  Have an affinity for the history so I suppose the theme is appealing to me.  That said, this is still a somewhat underrated game IMO.

Between online and in-person, I've played it over 520 times since April '06. I probably wouldn't have played so much, but I am really into the variable maps. (Using the Westpark gamers tool and then uploading to SBW.) Hits some of the same buttons than Ticket to Ride and Through the Desert do for me. Do I draft those cards now, or play some land/animals? Can I work on this part of the board and then go over there later, or will I get cut off? Throw in some money management and you have a winner. HUGE hit with my father-in-law, so we play a lot as well. I would happily buy some expansion maps if HiG or RGG released any. (44 In-Person games)

It seems like Through the Desert with less turn angst and more luck.  I've heard it called a more complex Through the Desert, but I don't see it.  Hacienda has more rules and components, but I felt like Through the Desert had far more interesting decisions and player interaction.  This is still a good game, and it has great components.  I will be playing it again.

[1 play] Initial reaction rating.  This was just a fun game to play.  I liked the theme and board.  I want to try the other side of the board now after it playing it once.  (I played the symetrical side)  After playing it once I was just totally like what if I did this a bit different or that a bit different.  The game just made me want to try it again and try different strategies and things to see if I could get more points.  It didn't strike me as being quite as deep as some of my all time favorite games, but very good after one play anyway.

Lots of decisions.  Every turn you'll want to do twice as much as you're allowed.  Interesting scoring.  Non-obvious strategy.

Nice game of lobbying for position, connecting to the most markets is the most important thing in this game. Water & hacienda's are nice scoring extra's when you can't connect to any more markets. Typical game where you always have less actions than you'd like. Playing time is not long, but plenty of meaningful decisions to make.

Has many alternate board lay-outs for download to keep the game fresh.

Why play this when you can play Through the Desert?  It's damn near the same idea although Hacienda adds rules that just make the game more cumbersome, not better.  I'll take Knizia's take on Go instead of Kramer's.  Further proof that I am not a Kramer fan.

Yee-haw.  Get along little doggies.  I was born in Montana and grew up with relatives in the ranching/rodeo business.  I guess I can relate more to this game than others can.  My only fault with it is that it seems to need more critter cards.  The mid-scoring and game end are triggered by running out of the meaty cards.  Cards are eliminated in the beginning if playing with fewer than four players.  Most games seem shorter than what they should be.  We eliminate fewer cards to curtail this feeling.  I also encourage using the board with more markets (the non-dogbone looking side).  The smiling pigs can be a little scary.

Has potential, and some clever ideas, and overtones of Through the Sausage and Moonie Mechanisms. It is always a good sign when you want your next turn to come round quickly, but the trade off is two or three stage (turn) plays. But it seems to be a muddle of timing, and action points, and trying out too many strategies. Wheat seems more valuable than animals? And what really beats a massive land chain? One of Kramer's better recent efforts, but it has an odd disconnected feel. Will revisit with asymmetric map, but little hope for this one.Oddly, all four players rated it 6 on the day. On balance, in the cold light of day, it may be a cast iron 6.5. I'd like to see it get up to a 7. Variants?

Reminds me of a cross between Ticket to Ride and Through the Desert.  Instead of choosing animals/lands you buy them, randomly unless you are lucky.

The one main drawback so far, seems to be a runaway leader problem.

Rating downgraded a bit after second play. Seems like players have plenty of options and paths to take, and the decisions aren't easy. However, in each of my first two games the victor was really determined by who got crowded on the board and who was left to expand unhindered, which I found disappointing. Update: in two additional games I was able to call the winner within three turns just based on board position (i.e. which players were destined to clash and which player would be left to build unimpeded. Lacking something to balance this inevitable dynamic, the game just isn't all that interesting. Rating further downgraded to 5 and Hacienda placed on trade pile.

Among hexy area-capture games, Hacienda has more busy work than the similar Through the Desert.  Hacienda fleshes out its theme with superfluous pesos and inscrutable board/card art.  But the whole thing works in spite of itself and most of my friends & family prefer Hacienda as the bigger "feeling" game.

First Impression:
A light euro with a badly pasted bad theme.

On the positive side, well, it's a euro so there are decisions.  Some interesting options in the form of lakes, ranches etc create a decent base for varying strategies. There is a sense of accomplishment.

The game is an abstract, and to add insult to injury the pasted theme is completely boring and dry. The board is ugly. There is luck of the draw, and the gameplay feels repetitive. The interaction is negative - just blocking. There is no differantiation at all among the animals or the terrain, other than to slow down players.

Overall, this is a very dry light euro that doesn't really excel in any field. While the mechanics are working, they are nothing special, and combined with the badly pasted bad theme I have no desire to play this again.

OK game, but nothing special that grabs my interest/attention.  Too much of a re-hash of existing mechanics (Through the Desert + card drafting) without anything really new or unique.

Been wanting to give this a go for awhile now, a friend has had it for a bit but I just never got the chance to play it until recently.  It feels like a nice little cross between Through the Desert and some of the card drafting games out there but it's a nice combination of those elements and implemented very well.  

UPDATE: Been awhile since playing this one and got it on the table again...I really like it a lot so upping the rating to 8 and now own my own copy of it.

RATING: 4
After playing this a few times on SpielByWeb, I don't feel any need to play this again.  It was alright, but Through the Desert scratches the same itch and is better because it eliminates all forms of luck.  Moreover the scoring system seemed very imbalanced in Hacienda with the market links scoring 1,3,6,10,15, etc. whereas the rest of the points were simply in increments of one or two -- UPDATE: Reduced to a 4 after playing again.  How could Kramer design El Grande, Java, Princes of Florence, and this?  It doesn't make any sense.  I don't understand why anyone would want to play Hacienda, I know I don't, 4 plays has been way more than enough.

(1 play) A pretty nice merging of a connection and set collection game -- though in a very different way from Ticket to Ride.  Note that the points are in the land, not the animals -- we took animals pretty quickly (probably because it's an easy play to get some bucks quickly) -- but to score points, you probably should resist the temptation.

Interesting game that, for me, fits the same mood as Thurn & Taxis. With a little less hand management and a little more point optimization. Halfway through my first game with two players I felt real tension, as there was still so much to do, but the animal piles (the endgame timer) were dwindling fast. I can see how people may be put off by its sturdy but bland components (save for Menzel's excellent artwork) and the dry points optimization, but to me the game came as a pleasant surprise, perfectly playable with only two players. Setup time is a bit on the long side for a game with this weight and length, but that is my only gripe.

An ok game. I actually found the game a little boring and fiddly. Not much to it after second play. The one thing I didn't like was the board placement as well as the similarity to Through the desert. Yeah, sure, there are more scoring options, but the game is simply less elegant with all the money flowing around. I particularly found that buying and getting money in this game to be rather uneven.

Tried this at BGG.CON and again at PrezCon.  This was a pretty enjoyable Through the Desert style connection game with a Ticket to Ride style card selection mechanism.This is my best guess rating, but we didn't have a proper translation, so we might not have played it right.  This game presents an odd delima, since I do like it, as my rating indicates, but it didn't really stand out on its own.  I am not sure I feel any need to own it.

I hate to use such a cliched and uninformative term, but this feels very "samey".  The triangular scoring of the markets feels stale in this setting, and in general it seems to aspire to far meatier ground than it actually occupies.  In addition, there seems to be a strict advantage of going earlier in the turn order.  I suppose it is worth one more play to confirm or deny this suspicion.  Or not.

If you like Kingdom Builder you must play this.  In some ways it's better (deeper out of the box with what you get), in some ways not (no expansions compared to KB)).  Rating might go up, however.  A really really solid game.  As much as I like KB and actually rate it higher, I'm currently enjoying Hacienda more, especially it being a deeper game without having to add anything to it.

Update: After a dozen or more plays, both iPad and regular, I've decided to up my rating to a 10.

with more plays I am learning that the scoring truly does allow several different paths to victory.

I first focused on the escalating point scale for Markets.  After recording scoring details for each category, we saw wide differences among players in Water and Land points that could also propel them to top scores.

Another tile laying game, this one with an economic engine behind it.  There's nothing here that really differentiates it from many other similar games.  There's positional play, and you use your positional play to set yourself up for making money and using the money to convert into VPs.  Another same ol', same ol' game.  I've played it once, and that'll probably be all I ever play it.  Not a game that I'll ask for again, and if my intuition is correct, probably not one that will get suggested much by other players either.

I can't really explain why after a couple plays I have no desire to play this again. I have fun while I'm playing, waiting to see if my next planned move gets thwarted before it gets back around to me, and I feel satisfied when I'm done playing, but perhaps it's just that there isn't enough variance from game to game... yes, I think that's it. I feel like Hacienda is an experience I enjoyed but that I don't find necessary to repeat, kind of like watching a decent but not classic movie.

Wolfgang Kramer; players compete for space on the South American pampas, aiming to bring their livestock to the most markets. You get three actions a turn to buy cards which then let you lay tiles to control land and herds, or you may buy extras, such as waterholes or the haciendas of the title to get bonus points; choose from two boards


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Someone else compared it to Magna Grecia and Through the Desert, and I can see what he means.  It takes the good elements of both games and combines them into something fun.  The fan-made maps give the game a lot of staying power (I'm sort of surprised that the designer/publisher didn't think to release produced expansion maps), and the cards prevent the game from having a static start, even if players play the same board each time.  It's neat to see the board get crowded, which forces players to make significant decisions near the start of the game.  It's nicely balanced, though, to give all players a chance to stay competitive up to the end of the game.

This is the first new game we've played since Essen where (a) everyone at the table had fun, (b) nobody thought the game was "too long", and (c) noboby immediately had "maybe they should do this to improve it" comments afterwards. At the price, this is a great bargain, and quite a fun game. The only quibble we had was the colour scheme seemed to make the board (and) cards a bit difficult to read, but this also didn't present a problem after the first third of the game (the card and board designs are subtle, but good graphic design makes it legible -- the terrain types have little flourishes that make them easily distinguishable, despite the restricted colour palate, for example).

Quite agree that the Feliz Navidad variant board is the one to use for 2p. Despite the unoriginal-seeming mechanics, this does feel different, esp. if you're looking at it in the light of Kramer's AP games.  Not sure I like the abruptness of the round end condition.  But the conflicting priorities are handled reasonably well, and the cash flow, which I was initially skeptical about, can create some hard choices.

Still, just another decent game that isn't good or unique enough to own in such a ridiculously crowded field.

When taught, I missed out on one rule (access to markets earning you points) and didn't do well, so my comments are tinged with that. However, I didn't like this game, it didn't do much for me. You have cards that let you place tokens representing your land and tokens representing your flocks. You have to earn money to buy more cards, lakes, and haciendas which earn you more points. It's all about points and the theme feels non-existant (Why do I have to make a line of the same animal to the market? Why does having a series of land spaces earn me points? Why can I build a lake and earn points from it?) All of this could be forgiven if it was fun, but I didn't really have any fun.

Players are ranchers in South America buying up land & herds of livestock.  Fast-paced turns and constant light decision-making make this a nice medium-weight family game.  Players can compete and be aggressive or play more mildly.  An interesting component to the game is the need to be mindful of cash flow - earning money can be done by bringing herds to market or by harvesting farmland, but care needs to be taken that actions are always used efficiently.  A very clever, fun game with multiple ways to win.

Zat enorm te twijfelen tussen de 6 en de 7, maar ben toch op de 7 uitgekomen. Dit spel is een spel dat in het teken staat van elkaar dwars te zitten. Het begin van het spel zal iedereen zich een goede uitgangspositie proberen te verschaffen voordat men elkaar echt dwars gaat zitten. Pas als men de dieren naar de markt laat gaan komt het spel echt tot leven en zit je eigenlijk iedere ronde minstens één van je medespelers dwars (en vaak meerdere). Heb enkel de eenvoudige kant gespeeld en denk dat de gevoprderde kant het spel nog wat meer jus geeft. De geluksfactor in dit spel is wel redelijk hoog. Als de goede dieren niet komen of je komt aan het begin van het spel al niet goed uit met je landschappen is het spel erg lastig om te winnen, vandaar mijn twijfel tussen 6 en 7.

Comparisons to Ticket to Ride and Through the Desert are obvious, but the game does offer some interesting twists on both games. Unfortunately, it includes some of my least favorite aspects of TTR -- the face up draw piles, where having matching cards available on your turn saves you precious actions, while invariably some players have to churn actions to get into playable positions. I also was shocked that there was no balancing system to soften the player order advantage to going early (or rather, the huge disadvantages to going later). I'd play it again, but I think Through the Desert offers a comparable gameplay experience in roughly half the time.

**UPDATE** After playing it again with 3 players, I think a lot of the problems I had with 5 players are minimized... I've upgraded my rating from 5 (as a 5 player game) to 6 overall (with a strong recommendation to play it with fewer players).

It's a typical German/Kramer game. Many things to do, only so many you may do, and many ways to score points. I wasn't too hot about it. It seemed very ho-hum. Money wasn't as tight as I thought it would be, and the scoring mechanisms seem contrived. One the one hand, it's a very Kramer-like game, on the other hand it feels as if it was designed by an amateur designer who just threw some random mechanisms together from other games.

With 5-players Hacienda was a lot more cutthroat than I had expected.  Long term planning was pretty much impossible as the board changes dramatically when it's finally my turn again.  A lot of my decisions came down to the cards I drew and where I didn't want to get shut out at.  Since I was almost last in the start order, I felt like I was playing catch up most of the time while performing damage control.  I would say that pretty much all of my actions were in response to what others have done, never once did I took the offensive so to speak.  The multiple ways to achieve VP was a nice touch, but the problem was once someone took the coveted positions away, if you cannot recover by claiming something equally valuable, the gap widens dramatically since there are two scoring rounds.

There seemed to be a good meaty game here, but I'm not sure if I enjoyed the experience.  The jury is still out on this one for me.

Hacienda hearkens back to the good ol' days of "want to do five things on my turn and can only do three" Euros.  Tons of different ways to score points, tons of different strategies.

The best family game. My parents asks me all the time to play "piggies". It's very random, but I rate it 9 because after 50 plays my family still wants more.

Similar to Through the Desert, but with more options for scoring (and earning profits).  While Thorugh the Desert was pretty strategic with 2 or 3 players, it became more chaotic with more.  Hacienda handles the additional players better.

This seems like a pretty solid and interesting game, although there is some pretty high-conflict vying for positions, allowing for people to expect each other to block Person A's opportunities.  Pretty cool overall, though!

After 2+ Plays: Everything has been tested and refined to such a level that I will enjoy playing, but everything in it can be found in other, better games.

A solid game, but nothing spectacular. I like the way there are several different ways to score, but it seems one of them is superior..

This game has been a pretty big hit after 2x playz.  It has pretty immersive aesthetics, and, of course, tension built off of (what feels like) an extremely limited set of available actions each round.  Also, for the record, I'm not a fan of Through the Desert.

This game looks moderately interesting, but man does Hans Im Gluck know how to produce a game.

Pleasant surprise. Very short game (about an hour), so it's no problem to decide to play it. Good gameplay, great strategy, fun to play.

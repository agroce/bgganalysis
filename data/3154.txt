Great theme, beautiful components, lots of options and more strategy than is first apparent.  Good family game if they can absorb the rules and don't mind playing about 2 hours.  The rules are not difficult, just a lot of little things to remember.  However, player aid included helps.  Luck in discovering tokens turns some people off, but that's just part of the game.  Also game is quite fiddly.  Just like in real life, a little luck can help.  Would be willing to trade only if the right trade came about.  I like the game, just doesn't get much play in my group.

Whilst the game looks very pretty and the bits are nice, doesnt actually appear to be much to do. Felt all moves were obvious and whilst there is a bit of interaction with other players, no real competitive tension in game.

Challenging title, with two distinct games you have to balance for success: one is a tile laying game that only obliquely helps you in the discovery part of the game. Interesting interlocking pieces, although very difficult to tell how you are doing in the game.

Nice underwater exploration theme and good game. There is a lot going on in this game with the need to balance your submarine exploration with station expansion.  The variable game end also adds a bit of strategy depending on how you are doing in the game. Don't underestimate having enough money to upgrade some of your treasures to the next level as this can make a big difference in the game, especially if you are behind. Tends to get the comment that it's a long game for what it is. That doesn't bother me much in this game. It has the added benefit of having a very unique theme which I enjoy.

RATING: 8.75
A most beautifully themed exploration game, with a mix of luck and strategy. The strategy lies in managing your constantly dwindling financial resources (in spite of how it looks at the start, you DON'T have heaps of money!!!). The two features that you can invest in (research and exploration) are MULTIPLIED together at game's end, and so you must constantly balance the two. The English translation of the rules is pathetic; but thankfully, the Geek has provided us with an excellent rules summary, which makes life beautiful. Finally, don't assume you've lost or won until the game is over: with the Secret Orders cards, you just can't be sure.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pretty good game.  The rulebook is overly long (11 pages or something), and looks intimidating.  As it is, the rules are actually pretty simple (once you get into the game).

Luck definitely plays a role, but the game provides mechanics to accommodate it...kinda.  By the midpoint of our game, nobody was even using the sonar, as it proved cost-prohibitive at times.  

Regardless, it's a decent enough game.  Nothing I'd bring out on a weekly basis, but it's still decent.

Though we started out with a less-than-stellar explanation from someone who was playing at another table at the same time and some rules that could have been better written, there came a point in the game where everyone, including me, started "getting" it.
The bits are beautiful, the decisions difficult. A couple of the treasure tiles might be a tad too valuable but that can be fixed. 
Moved to a 6 after a second play

This game is not that great. The money you get is useless since no one runs out of money. Once you get all your modules set up - the rest of the game is mostly going out on a sub to explore. Not very competitive unless there's more players.

RATING: 6
{1 play, 4 player} I almost dropped this down to a 5 (or lower), as the more I think about this game, the more it disappoints me.  I wasn't thrilled with the "cold war" aspect of stealing/protecting your module bonuses, and the "exploration" part is kind of dull - get near any tile, flip it, and hope.  Yeah, I know, you can use your radar, but money ends up being so tight, it didn't seem worth it for the extra "strategy."  If the whole thing only took 30-45 minutes, I wouldn't mind as much.  But... the game is, indeed, quite lovely to look at (and play with), and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it wasn't as heavy as it's always looked to me.  And I like the *idea* of the game... Sadly, I'm not itching to try it again.

Unfortunately this game has very little strategey because of the random nature of the treasures.  Resource building only effects the beginning of the game, and doesn't have a big effect on the outcome.  Good game for younger kids but definitely not for adults.

Multiplier-based scoring system results in huge differences, the exploration part of game is lackluster, turn order seems to be the deciding factor in maintaining your lead in research modules. My interest faded rather quickly.

RATING: 8
This game flys under the radar too often.  It is a nice design that challenges players to balance 2 play objectives - collecting treasure and securing influence in the research station.  The game offers penalty of strategy options for the players.  Timing is key to successful play.  A better game than it appears on the surface (no pun intended) and worthy of owning.  Almost a gamers' game.  [GTI Code: TGSD]

I have mixed emotions about this game after two plays. I've played with 4 and 2 players. It was faster with two of course, but still seemed to outstay it's welcome by about 30 minutes. My son triggered the end game by finding the last of the three highest ruin tiles. I faked disappointment. 

So, it's long and not terribly exciting, but for some reason, there is something about it I still like. I dig the theme and production quality of the game. I also like the unique way you need to budget your money as you don't get much more throughout the game.

I'm a big fan of adventuring games, and Nautilus is not quite that---but still a lot of fun as an exploration and resources management game.  The game materials are gorgeous, and wandering the ocean floor with little submarines is fun!  Of course, you must keep in mind that it's as much of a resource management as an exploration game---poor resource maangement (or should I say *research* management?) leads to poor exploration opportunities.

RATING: 4
Slow game with a wild finale. With leader bashing, there can be swings of 50 victory points (or more) on the last turn. I didn't think that there was really that much wrong with the game, but it's not one I'd want to play frequently. The building and exploration both feel very slow. I also felt more strapped for researchers than I did for money, which drew me out of the theme. With its strong luck element, Nautilus wore out its welcome before its end.

RATING: 6
Not too bad, but feels a lot like the Ditt's scenarios in the Siedler book - a bit mechanical, and it seems just a bit klunky. There is a lot of stuff going on, and it's not clear that very much of it is important. For example, the constant paying of 1 Nemo back and forth to occupy research stations seems to be designed just to wear out the money. Also, they claim in the hints section that money is tight, but in our game even the most spendthrift player never came close to running out. Still an interesting game which I'll play again, but not quite up to the standards of Kosmos big-box stuff IMHO. Might need to try with a lower starting capital allotment.

Pretty decent game that's almost two separate games in one.  One part of the game is deploying your scientists in the underwater structure to increase your abilities, and the other is roaming around in your subs trying to find the goodies.  While neither part is incredibly exciting, they do come together to make a fairly fun game that I would play occasionally.

Boring, repetitious, and almost completely devoid of meaningful competition.  Nautilus looks great, has a cool theme, but ultimately it's so gamey and dull that it isn't fun.  Probably has the most artificial money element I've ever seen in a game.  Practically everything you do- from turning on the sonar to picking up a conch shell- costs you a "nemo" (that's a buck for us surface-dwellers).  There's some good concepts here (building the underwater research base, discovering Atlantis) but the game is pretty (he he) washed up.

I was never quite sure about buying this game: there was talk about too much luck  in the discovery of the treasures. But after a few plays, I have grown rather attached to the little explorers and submarines working their way along the depths of the ocean. The game material looks absolutely gorgeous and sets the mood if nothing else. As for the luck... The problem I have with the game is that there is a rather solid manoeuvring game going on which has the players vying for the best spots on the sea floor. Here you can build and manipulate and decide in which technical areas you want to be the best. Unfortunately, they make up just half of the points. The other half is found by exploration, and although there are means to do this cheaply and effectively, the distribution of chits can be a killer. Players simply cannot look at everything, and if the distribution happens to be 'off' (no mollusks of the right type in the immediate vicinity, no treasure chests), then you can play all you want, but you will lose. Money is very tight in this game, and if a player is lucky enough to get an influx from treasures, there is almost no stopping him. For a game which lasts as long as Nautilus does, that is a serious setback. I closed my eyes against this issue for far too long, hoping that the luck would prove to be 'fair', but it isn't. If in a game the randomness is against you, you may deduct another point from the game's current rating.

You&#039;ll either love this game or hate it.  I think it&#039;s great! Lots of decisions to make, and the theme and the bits are terrific!  You have to balance your submarine discoveries with you station building - if you don&#039;t have a good balance, you WILL lose this game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very pretty game (though the bits are plastic, for those who dislike such things). Gameplay is entertaining, but feels a touch lighter than I'd like, particularly for the time involved? 

Perhaps it's because each of the two parallel-but-interacting game-parts (the structure-building/influence-competition of the station, and the gathering and memory of sub exploration) is, by itself, on the lighter side - and while the interactions aren't trivial, neither are they quite enough to really turn it into a larger-scale system I can sink my teeth into. Not sure.

I enjoy this game, which is a nice mix of Ameritrash and Euro.  The mechanics fit the underwater theme well, and there are a few different strategies for victory.  There are lots of small fiddly bits, and the game may just be a little too complex for the depth of play (there's quite a bit of luck in the discovery tiles).  Very difficult to anticipate who is leading the game until the final scoring.  Furthermore, it's quite long for it's depth (see what I did there?).

A bit too long for the amount of fun I had with it. Its got the great "10 things I want, but I can only have one" game factor. The luck of the tile discoveries isn't too bad and the strategic play comes in with which modules to build & deploy when. Getting the timing right for the bonus technology points is critical as well as balancing that with getting your subs launched. Good eye-candy too.

Large, beautiful game of exploring the ocean floor. Players build research centres, and staff them to improve their technology rating in five areas.  They are also sending out submarines to recover goodies out in the deeps.  Their score at the end is the product of their technology and recovery efforts, plus cash remaining.  Nicely balanced game where you can't neglect anything or your score suffers.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Great resource management/exploration game.  My main reservation is that the scoring system forces you to use a balanced strategy, so it might end up making all the games more or less the same.  Also, all the money changing can be a bit fiddly.  Speaking of which: if you're not having money problems in this game, you've probably got a rule wrong!

An interesting game of medium complexity. The board and pieces are undeniably cool and colorful, and make the game more fun than it deserves to be. Weighing against this factor is the game's high price.

The exploration aspect is fun, but the heavy micromanagement is likely to turn off some players. I've only played it with 2 players, and it seems like it would be better with more. My main gripe is that it sometimes feels like the game is playing you. Victory will go to the player who has maximized his efficiency and penny pinching throughout the game. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as it depends on what you like in a game. As for me, I'd rather play something with more risk taking, and tougher, more challenging decisions. I'm not so into the penny-pinching and efficiency-maximizing aspects of the game.

I have played this once where a overly agressive player decided to shut down every move I made. It was not an enjoyable experience. 

That player has since left the gaming group. I should probably give this game another try.

Really nice exploration game where you have to really manage your 'nemo'(currency) very carefully or you can end up penniless and at the mercy of others/random events.

Points score at the end is a multiplier of your discoveries and the development of the city you have contributed to so you have to balance you actions as concentration on discoveries might get you a high score but when that is multiplied by only 1-2 because you neglected the city then somebody who balanced both aspects can acheive a better score.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.8
The multiplier at the end of the game created a huge scoring disparity between the players. A house rule was suggested that just counts points without using the multiplier.  After just one game I am not in favor of changing the rules on a play that was play tested far more than once.  Anxious to play again because would play very differently. Several possibilities for game strategy.

Quite a nice looking game, my first exploration game. Others in my gaming group were not impressed, seemed to drag with 4 players but we were still learning the rules.

RATING: 7
Rating after one play.  Seemed a bit cumbersome at first, but gradually started to flow a bit faster - just a bit too late.  A second play should be a great improvement as we were all learning, but I fear there is as much chance of my opinion of this one dropping.  I like the theme and the game seems to work well, but I have reservations about it having lasting appeal.  We will see what develops.

UPDATE 17AUG05:  After last night's play (and it was a long time getting it back to the table) this one is a keeper.  There was some concern about the chance elements, but when all was said and done the game went to the player who best took advantage of sonar and second place to the player who took advantage of treasure (by improving the appropriate research).  And this time, the station building was cut-throat.  The key point is everybody really enjoyed the game; I have upped my rating to an 8.

UPDATE 20DEC06:  I have generally adjusted many ratings; this hasn't been out for a while so has dropped to a 7 again.

Good exploring game where you score on technical evolution and exploration of the sea. The product of both scores(evolution & exploring) gives you your score at the end. During the game is no really clear who is going to be the winner but this is not a bad thing. Luck is involved but you can optimize it...

RATING: 8.2
A very beautiful game of exploring the sea bottom. A very good balanced mix of both strategy and luck (unless you hate luck). You have limited money to spend to build the base station and man the crew. find buried treasures and try to keep from running out of research money. You also have secret mission cards to help your score. At the end of the game the multiplication of different scores you accumulate during the game make for some surprising winners!

RATING: 9
Great theme, glorious presentation and components, Nautilus requires a thorough understanding of its rules to both play the game competitively and enjoy the experience as well.  So many decisions and so many ways to go right or wrong in this one.  Many games that are rated higher offer lots of decision making, but come up short in the fun department - not so Nautilus! I have a lot of games and a friend wanted the game, so I sold it. I won't playing another's copy sometime.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
Setup takes quite a while, with all the pieces to this game. Though it has a very interesting undersea development and exploration theme, that really flows well with the game. The components look great, it not a little fiddly.

Game play is fun and competitive. Trying to build research stations and send out your subs, to explore and hunt down treasures. All before your opponents beat you to the punch. The game board is pretty big and you'll need a nice sized table to play this one on.

This is a decent gamers game with a little bit of depth, but nothing to heavy and it's all pretty easy to pick up on, as the game moves along.

What's funny is that I really enjoyed the game, I won it running away, the bits are awesome - but I know I'd never get to play it, even if I owned a copy. Sigh.

Hate.  HAAAATE! Nice-looking components (aside from the color).  Too bad the gameplay was so unrewarding.In all fairness, I DID play it with the slowest learner I have EVER played a game with.  I may give it another shot.  Someday.  Once the taste of the first one has been washed out of my system.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Excellent game!  Luck factor is quite small since only luck (finding the right treasures) won&#039;t increase your gained points enough to win the game. The system to calculate your final result is fairly clever: multiplying the treasure-rate by the level of your research. And research... that&#039;s where strategy comes in!
PS: very nice design (board, submarines, ...).

RATING: 8
This a great exploration game.  I love the need to balance scoring between the base and the discoveries.  The components are very colorful and high quality.  The playmats include a great turn summary, however, there are a handful of easily forgotten rules.  The game time (~2 hr) is a bit long, which I fear will restrict play opportunities, but I would gladly make the time.  Lots to do, little money to fund it, and much joy of exploring.

RATING: 9
This game is very interesting and fun. I enjoyed playing it quite a bit. the bits and board are beautiful. I would have given it a 10 except for the fact that it is exteremly long. The run time is suppose to be 90-120 minutes but after 3 hours we weren't even close to done. While this is not a bad thing in my book, it was just too long for some of the other players. With that stated, it would have been a 10 if it was shorter because the game is some what simple for it running time. Maybe when we all get more experienced at it and play it will be much shorter but playing with people who don't know how to play or haven't played before (which is the usual case with my crowd) it goes too long. But maybe I will update it to 10 later one.

While not bad, it does tend to get a bit slow in the end. The theme is good, the gameplay smooth and easy to learn, but it's just not a game I tend to take out very often. It looks beautiful, but I really have to be in the mood when I take this one off the shelf.

A very economic/penny pinching, which normally irritates me to hell, but I loved this one. The theme is fantastic and unique, the board looks great, I love how you have to balance your station research with your deep sea exploration, how maximizing your abilities is offset by the potential for other players to steal the bonus points away from you unless you manage to get to the highest level, and how hard it is to decide which points/research/treasures are worth going for and which aren't. Really unique and fascinating game. The only real downsides are the plastic pieces, relatively heavy setup and rules that - while they aren't that complex - are still kind of hard to explain.

This is a gorgeous game where mechanics and theme are very well integrated. I really enjoy building the undersea research station and sending my submarines to explore the depths. The only weakness is the randomness in flipping tokens worth victory points and much needed treasures. This is in accordance with the theme, of course, but it adds an amount of luck that may be a little high for a game that typically takes two hours.

This wasn't a terrible game, but when I played with three I thought it really came down to the luck of the draw.

I can almost imagine this playing well as a family game, being packed with interesting theme and bits. For gamers this is quite random, in that the tiles you pick up (mostly blind) are a big influence on your score, while having to pay to use sonar (and so reveal the tiles) seems inconsistent with operating a submarine.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
One of those cases where the theme and mechanics work together. Sure, there are some annoying bits (you can build modules faster than you can walk, only 3-4 players can really play the game, it's playtime runs a little long), but it really sucks you into this world of science and discovery. It has tile laying, worker placement, racing, and exploration all wrapped into one nice little game. The playing pieces are well made and thematic, and they even included a box insert that (mostly) works. I picked this up for a really cheap price (apparently it didn't sell well), and it was money well spent, as it's a great game overall.

I wanted to love this game. I love the theme (underwateradventure), I love the graphic (some kind of Captain Nemo Style) and I love the game components (little plastic subs). But when I played the game the first time I wasn´t really excited, there is little tension when you build up the underwaterbase and when you explore the deep sea for treasures of good old Athlantis.
But for a family game it is o.k. although I am a little dissapointed. This game could have been a really cool and classic game.

I had been interested for a long time in this game but the lackluster reviews and the look of the game kept me at bay. I managed to pick up a copy very cheaply in the summer of 2008.  I still didn't get around to playing it until Jan.2009 and I have to say, it wasn't worth the wait. It's not terrible, it's just not very deep.  There is some strategy to building the research modules and gaining the 3 research points.  However, the luck in finding the Atlantic pieces is just huge!  Sure, you can use sonar but that's pretty limited, you still need to be in the right place at the right time.  

In my only game of this, a three player game, there was a three way tie for Atlantic pieces.  The tie breaker is who discovered the highest numbers. That's total luck and was the turning point in the game.  Whoever won that 5 point piece would have won the game and it came down to simple luck of the draw. 

I don't mind luck in a game, so if this had been a 60-90 minute game I would have been fine with it, but it took about 160 minutes to finish this game.  There's just not enough game here for me for such a time commitment.

Good game, not outstanding. Can be a tight resource game. 

The board is nice, the rules are clear, and I can feel the theme in just reading the rules; that's a good thing. It seems that this would be a good follow up to Settlers or Starfarers of Catan. 

UPDATE 11/25/04: This is a good game. It runs a bit long for some, but it is well balanced and still really holds the theme together well. It's a tight money game and forces some neat problems as you decide what to do. 

NOTE: you have to remember that you can sail over things, including other players subs and the station. It's important when running around the board.A good purchase. It's not one I will break out every session, but I am willing to play it and I think it's a unique design/idea.

Decent exploration game with lovely bits.  You expand the shared underwater laboratory, managing your men to get majority control in varying sections.

How much fun can you have with little plastic men and submarines?  A lot.  2-4 players and it is a great balance between research, exploration and NOT running out of money.  Similar balancing, albeit quite diffent, to the balancing required in Tigris & Euphrates.  It's not a long game per se, but probably does run 90-120 minutes and feels a little long for what is not a heavy game.  Still like it, but it is not top of class material.

Dammit, I really wanted to like this game. It looks great and has cool pieces, but no. I guess the main problem is that it just has too little to offer for the time it takes, and hence gets boring after about halfway in play. If someone comes up with a way to make this last about half the time, it might be a lot better. Actually, I can think of a couple of ways myself - increase sub movement rate, get a resident station plus buy a research station during same turn etc. - but it might break the balance. Perhaps I'll try it some day and if it works, upload the variant for others to enjoy.
As a final note, for an exploration game, the sea exploration is not as much fun as it should be.

The players are building a research station at the bottom of the sea, trying to find Atlantis, recover sunken treasures, and extract raw materials. Nice, solid game.

Good game, prefer it at more than 2-players however.
The fact that your people get locked when they start working on a station seems to confuse people for the first few turns, but it makes sense once you have built out a ways.

Received in trade. 

Runs a little on the long side and analysis paralysis can be a problem. Relatively difficult to teach since, at first, it appears there are a lot of rules to keep straight and it's difficult for the new person to see the impact of choices on subsequent turns.

However, overall the game is very enjoyable. The unknown of uncovering treasure, the tight money management, the fight for Atlantis dominance, etc. all combine to make a nicely themed and competitive game.

Only played it once so far, and I *sucked*. The trick is definitely to balance both scoring tracks so that you can take advantage of the multipliers. Looking forward to a second go.

An interesting game, with the standard little weird, incongrous rules from German games.  The research modules allow you to look at any space if you find a valueless shell?  What is that supposed to represent?  And what's with the transforming subs?  A lot of accounting, but does allow for several different strategies.  Nice little submarines, but very delicate-looking scientists.  Pretty board.

Exploration/research game. Upon reading the rules it seems as though this game has got all the elements needed to be an instant hit. However play lacks any kind of serious tension or excitement. If the game could somehow last 1.5hours I could be convinced to play again, but at 3 hours I'd rather play something with a higher payoff.

Wow, I really enjoyed this one! As we were going over the rules (and making fun of how badly written and edited they were - note to gaming companies... I am available to write and/or edit the rules for your games, so please contact me!), I didn't get the feeling that this would be much more than a light bit of (hopeful) fun. Not to be punny, but this game has a lot of depth! The resource management is balanced incredibly well, and the decisions throughout the game are interesting and difficult. I can't wait to have another go at this one. I can't believe that some people are calling this a game with very little strategy, as I found it to be just the opposite.

RATING: 8
I liked a lot how there are two things you need to do (the exploring and station building) and how those two are loosely connected to each other as your researchers are send to explore on subs but they can come back to station and this can change the majority battles in a bit unexpected way. I like the scoring that is basically "value of station" times "value of exploring" and you cannot focus too much on the other but must balance between these two. Building has a clever restrictions: You must build (or discard) all your bought pieces at once and the price is the same whether you build one or four. Waiting seems like a good idea but then you lose cheaper building ground. There were moments when AP problems arise when planning where and what to build. Theme is something you don't see too often and to me that is a plus.

It seems to be one of those games where you spend a lot of time setting up, and setting out to find things, and gaining a majority lead to help your score - only to find that the game winner is determined by the luck of who blindly picks up what they need on the last turn to edge their score up to that next level whilst you find a measly treasure chest instead. Beautiful bits, nicely themed, good stuff to think about in the race for lab majorities, combined with the fun and agony of discovery. But the luck at the end overwhelms all the good bits.

Finally played this a couple of times and it is a very interesting game.  With only three subs you can deploy, your choices become very difficult.

RATING: 6
After the 1st play, probably never play with 4 again, principally due to the downtime (though the decisions to make are easier so comparitively quicker). Another issue is that the board gets alittle busy, making it a little challenging to assess, though the player mats help. Also on the mats are the current players scoring status which is plus even though it involves multiplying two areas. Firstly I like the strong thematic narrative of play, with the seeking and discovery of treasures; even your little figures are removed to place submarines. Other enjoyable aspects are the decisions of which modules to buy, then when, where and how to place them tactically. There is even a simplistic monetary layer to consider. I also like the way that to minimise the luck of tile flipping this is resolved thematically with sonar, especially useful in competitive situations. Overall a game I'd be happy to immerse myself in next time with 3 players.

RATING: 7
One 3-player game taking about 3 hours, including learning the rules. At first it seemed to have depth in Module selection & placement but on reflection it seems that nearly all the Modules will be placed and will be Activated as needed by the players. The exchange of Activation payments will even out so they seems a bit moot. Appears to be important to get Subs going right away for Discovering and to return 3 seeples (seaples?) to the pool. Every seeple will be placed to do the necessary Activations so no depth of decisions there either. Discovery tiles need to me collected as much as possible, both those that help you and those that prevent other players from using them for scoring. This makes Sonar pretty much useless, just collect away. The final distribution of the big 3-pt VP tiles should be more-or-less equally spread with the lesser holders probably in a bad way for scoring. Discovery is entirely random so luck plays a significant part in the final tile distributions. All-in-all none of the decision making is too deep and luck plays a big role in the outcome. This, combined with the multiplicative final scoring, makes the finishing order chaotic with the possibility of large point spreads even though the player's actions may have been very similar. My conclusion is that a game I first thought would be an 8 with a tendency to AP really seems to play like more of a drawn-out 6.... but I want to play it again so... a 7.

A gorgeous game with a great theme. The rulebook is a little redundant and takes a while to get through, but gameplay is fast and easy once you get the hang of it.

I didn't notice the length of the game until the final few rounds, which I think is a good sign of how much fun it is.

Just be careful how you spend your Nemo dollars. Going broke is a sure way to stop having fun in Nautilus.

Tends to be a long game, but it adds $$$ management, building, action points for moving, and exploration.  All under the sea!  The theme works ok.  The bits can pull you in.  Only reason its not played more is because of length.  But its worth its price to play it at least 1 time a year.  Very tense game at the end too...  Underdogs have made comebacks against who was thought to be in the lead through the clever use of sonar to dig up just the right goodies...  :)

Decent game - interesting mechanics combined for a thematic experience of exploring the ocean.  My main beef with the game was that it was just a little too long for the experiences offered.  Plus the rules were a little too complex for the family nature of the offering.

Great (if a bit too tiny) bits...I really got a kick out of the "20,000 bits Under the Sea" nickname on here--I couldn't agree more.  My rating is more a reflection of the overall effort of setting the game up and what you get out of it.  It's not HORRIBLE, but it isn't great.  For some reason though, I really enjoy playing it.  It's mechanics are invididually simple but altogether a bit much for newbies.  Great artwork, though, and high quality components.  I was a bit disappointed by the game given how it looked, etc.  It is satisfyingly rich, but somehow a bit disjointed.

This is a gorgeously produced game that looks really cool set up. I liked seeing the station grow, and there were definitely some ways you could screw with people on the building phase.

Ultimately it was too long for what it is, and too random. The tiebreaker for Atlantis is whoever discovered the higher piece--which is totally random! Also, I happened to get dealt the card that made usually worthless shells worth something, but whether I got any during the game was still very random. I happened to, so yay me! The fact that you multiply these numbers makes that luck even more swingy.

I know you can use sonar to increase your odds of getting something good, but you still have to be in the right part of the ocean. Plus, I didn't use sonar [i]once[/i], and I completely and utterly destroyed the living crap out of everyone. But since it's so random I'm really not bragging.

Too random for a gamers game, and too much going on for a family game (my family, at least).

I found this game to be a lot more pleasant than its reputation implied.  The combination of the construction of the station with the exploration of the surrounding sea is quite interesting.  This, combined with the two tier multiplicative scoring, forces you to balance your activities.  This makes for an interesting play experience.  It doesn't hurt that my eldest daughter [i]really[/i] likes the game, wanting to play way more often than I feel up to it.  In fact, its biggest problem is that it often takes longer to play than I really want to spend on it.  That, though, is not a fault of the game as it seems to fit the theme well.  [08/10/2007]

Gorgeous bits, great to watch the board grow.  Lots of great opportunities to screw other players, and fun ways to make power moves.  But a two player game feels a bit more like an excercise rather than a game.  Plus, we kept having to refer back to the rules where something is covered in two or three different sections(what is this an Avalon Hill game?).

I suspect this will go up in ratings though.

Update: I was wrong.  It went down.  It is certainly better with more than two players, but I feel that most of the choices are clear and the player that draws the luckiest wins.  Of course being flexible back at the base helps.  The point swing is just two high when you are multiplying values.  The game is just too thinky and intricate on one end compared to the pay out for discovering the "Right" tiles.  Against all my best wishes I just don't enjoy this.

The theme is very well implemented, but this game is waaaaaaaaay too long. The randomness in picking up ('discovering') the hidden tiles also doesn't help.

This is a "first-impressions" rating based on a 2-player game, but I won't knock the game too badly for being seriously sub-optimal with just 2 (and I suspect even 3) players.  Rather, I'm going to rate the game while pretending I've played with 4 players, which I'm guessing would be by far the best experience.  So anyhow, there are few things more exciting amongst board game mechanisms than exploration and technological enhancement, and this game is all about those 2 things (as well as the far less exciting "money management").  With exploration being a pivotal part of the game, the luck factor seems like it could be fairly heavy, so it remains to be seen whether or not this will become frustrating.  The components are great (although the figures are rather tiny) and the game is a beauty to behold when it's up and running.  (The only thing I've replaced is the paper money with poker chips.)  This is clearly not a "sit down and whip through a game of Nautilus" sort of game, but sometime when I've got at least a couple of hours free and exactly 3 more friends with me, I'm very much looking forward to playing this game again!  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8/10

Not a bad game, but not an especially good game either, and it lasts longer than my interest in it.  The special attraction is the multitude of bits.  My name for this game is "20,000 Bits Under The Sea."

Originally I rated this 'Nearly one of the worst game that I own.'

Three years on, I realise that I was totally wrong. I played this game again and it played well. There was much more strategy over what and where to build than I recall from my first experience. It was also possible to evaluate the worth of each item explored in a way that our group didn't realise first time around. The exploration theme and the added competition to earn bonuses for leading the discovery of Atlantis relics plus the chase to stay ahead in each of the 5 research areas made this a rivetting game from start to finish.

I never knew it was possible to misjudge a game so much by it's first play. Especially as I had bought it with high hopes.

Lots of decisions, good replayability, fun game! IMHO, the luck/randomness factor that I see others suggesting, is a very small aspect (sea discoveries). It is a little too long...

RATING: 6
A game with a lot of rules, a lot of pieces, and a lot of setup. For every good thematic element, there's an arbitrary-seeming rule that makes the game too fiddly for my tastes. I've only played it once and so my opinion is no doubt biased due to learning all the rules, but overall I found it to be a competently designed but uncompelling game.

This game ran too long. Ideally, it should finish leaving people wanting more, but on our first play, two players were clearly out of contention and the game continued for another 45 minutes or so.

The variable end conditions are a nice idea, but all result in an approximately equal length play. A way to restrict this, or perhaps limit the number of rounds would help.

Beyond that, Nautilus is a fun game though. It isn't without faults, but it is one I'd happily see hit the table again soon.

A solid and fun game, with elements of strategy and luck, let down by two irresolvable end-game issues: one or more players might run out of money and be effectively eliminated from the game, and by the end of the game, almost all labs/meeples/chits are in play, obviating the need for careful plan-ahead.

RATING: 5
There is a lot to like about this game, such as the artwork, the bits, and the immersive theme.  However, for it's length, it just has a wacky scoring system.  Two numbers are multiplied to arrive at the final score, which means that small changes in each half of the score mean large differences in the end.  It just seems like 30-point swings in the last five minutes of a three-hour game are kind of crazy.

One of most tedious games I've ever played. There's little tension or strategy here. I'm not a huge fan of pick-up-and-deliver/exploration games, but this one is worse than most. Even the set collection aspect of Nautilus is boring. Submarines, underwater research stations, sunken treasure and discovering lost artifacts of Atlantis could be a lot of fun, but Nautilus somehow turns this cool theme into a drab experience.

This theme is my JAM, and as such I love the way the game looks, but my friends actually liked this more than I did.  It's a solid game, but maybe a little dry for my tastes.  This isn't a game of agonizing decisions, it's a game of incremental gains, backed (somewhat unfortunately) by lucky tile draws.  Fun, but not top-shelf material in my book.

I really like the look of this game and I did enjoy the few times we played. I just wish it was better. Seems to be missing something.... sea monsters - direct conflict?  I don't know... something. The tile laying aspect is a bit deeper than it looks initially (no pun intended) and can be a slight brain burn in a good way. Money is super tight but seems to work with the end game conditions well. For trade but will play again if I have 3 (maybe 4) that want to play.

Great looking with a nice evocative theme of deep sea exploration tied into the gameplay.  I enjoy the idea of constructing the station while sending your submarines out to discover the surrounding territories.  However, I did not like the actual mechanics involved in building the structure, the movement within it and how it affected the different technologies.  In fact, I think the whole first player to reach the highest of each track earns these many VP to be poorly implemented.  Then there is the hidden goal that let's you purchase point upgrades at the end of the game, which to me was just bizarre.  Chalk Nautilus up to be an ok experience but probably won't ever want to play it again.

This is stated as a medium-weight-game. I would say it is a light-weight-game, but it can be hard to play for unexperienced players. And it really is not that hard to play. The three phases stated above is all about there is to it. It’s a fun game, but not great. The only negative thing about it, that it feels that it takes longer then it should.

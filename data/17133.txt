It's hard not to like this. Eagle have finally gotten a fully developed game to rank alongside their excellent production values. This, of course, is down to Martin Wallace and the fact that the game has in essence undergone a long development cycle right back to Lancashire Railways. I hesitate to call Railroad Tycoon 'Age of Steam' lite as some have done because it isn't really lite. It just places more emphasis of the 'fun' aspects of the game rather than Age of Steam's tendency to push the 'gamer' limits. RT certainly has more theme to it than AoS and is more forgiving to the casual gamer. AoS remains my favourite game but I'm quite happy to own both.

Age of Steam lite (sort of), which means tile-laying (tracks), route-planning, tough economic decisions (not as tough as AoS), and a strong theme (unlike AoS).

A very thematic, overproduced game about building up a railway empire.  It's definitely a revised version of Age of Steam (AoS), but has noticeable differences in addition to its many similarities.  For starters, the game plays 2-6, which is a big plus, and it is much easier to jump in and play.  In other words, although this is a high strategy game, it is much less gruelling than AoS, which is a good thing for beginners, and even myself who rates AoS very highly.

Gameplay involves getting money (shares to start usually) in order to build track, in order to ship goods, which nets you real money, as well as points.  There is an auction for player order, then you have 3 turns each per round, but of course you want to do much more than just 3 things, as does everyone else.  You can buy track (and the one-link limit makes the game much more accessible, as people can't be immediately locked out of certain regions), you can ship a good (only one per turn, making it again harder to completely drain resources immediately), or select a card (and then possibly use it).  The cards range in ability, but of course you can always bid higher to have first choice.

You also have a tycoon card which is a hidden bonus victory condition for you, if you achieve it.  Taking shares is simple- you just take as many as you need, but you have to pay $1000 each round, and they are minus 1 point per share at the end of the game.  Tough yes, but not as devastating as in AoS.  You also make "real" money sooner in this game, and thus don't feel absolutely broke the whole game, although there is an income reduction that occurs only if you get way up in points.

Overall this is an awesome game if you like AoS, as you actually want to play the game, rather than subject yourself to an exercise in economic decision making torture (re: AoS).  That's not to say there aren't tough decisions in Railroad Tycoon (RRT), it's just that the consequences are less stringent.  I think with more plays RRT will outshine AoS for me, in large part because it will see the table more often and reach a larger audience of players.

I must admit I like this game more than I thought I would. The gameplay has just the right amount of depth -- enough rules and options to be interesting but not overwhelming. The game length is a workable 2 hours or so (even with 5 players). All 3 games I've played have been very different, which bodes well for replayability (and I haven't even touched Chicago yet!). Negatives: quality problems with the board and components (see sbabcock's review).

After a couple of plays (Railroad Tycoon), I must say that it's an improvement over Age of Steam (AOS). 

Things I like:

* It's faster playing (vs. AOS) with games ending so quickly that it can catch you off guard.The railroad operation cards are a very nice touch adding randomness to the game and lots of tactical goals to take advantage of. More ways to victory versus the AOS system.

* Building a network is more organic and realistic in this game with much, much less of the tricky, spiral track building found in a successful AOS victory. 

* While the economics aren't painful like AOS, there's a subtle importance of being thrifty and wise with expenditures. 

* Auctions are not quite the ugly, thrashing battles of AOS but are generally more dignified with an occasional battle very early in the game over geographic position or over a very important railroad card.

Now things I don't like:

* Okay let me get it out - the game board is RIDICULOUS in its size. It's simply not designed with the game players in mind. It's more like a model railroader decided to create a map and pieces. The map should be 30-40% smaller for true competitive play and tournament play. Important railroad operation cards can be a long distance from 1 or more players. Some people talk about their place at the table actually determining where they will build because it's easier to see what's in front of you and they're lazy. I understand that point. 

* Also, I don't like the way the victory point track was created. It's very difficult to keep the locos where they should be on the track and the printing of VP's and income is just too small. The older I get, the more this last point is important.

* The rules are vague in a couple of important places and a set of revised rules or official FAQ is something truly needed.

* Three player game balance is very tricky. Two players is straight forward and four players is probably the sweet spot. Five and Six player games probably make for a longer more unruly game but that wouldn't effect play balance. It might have been nice if specific scenarios had been created for 2 and 3 player games (beyond initial cube distribution and number of empty city markers). Scenarios that take out geographic portions of the board (along with certain cards) and maybe give players a specific Tycoon card as a goal.

Overall, I like the game as railroad games go. Is it my favorite? Not sure. I really, really like Ticket to Ride/Marklin Edition. But more RRT plays may change my mind as to my favorite... or not.

Imagine taking Age of Steam, making it more forgiving from a rules standpoint, and outrageously fiddly from a component stand point and you have this.

The stakes are low, player interaction is reduced, and the eyecandy is floridly over-the-top. Clearly the designer is trying to dress up Age of Steam for the stereotypical gamer.

The core Age of Steam ideas are still great.

This really is a Great game, 

theres luck in the cube draws, operation cards and bonus cards. But there is alot of strategy and tactics involved to win.

I've owned this game for a couple years now and I still consider it my favourite game.  It's got amazing replayability and a bunch of offical expansions. and dozens of unofficial ones.  You can't go wrong with this game!

RRT is certainly no Age of Steam, but it is a very enjoyable game for what it is. I'm really curious to try the Rails of Europe expansion, I think that will really cinch this as a good game to have around. UPDATE: I think I'm done with the basic map. I still want to try Europe... we'll see if it can convince me to keep the game around.

I had been waiting RT a lot, and the first impression after the first game was a disappointment: it wasn't that much fun and compact as TTR is. BUT, after a few more games with more than two players, the game showed it's potential. Interesting, fun and all-around a good game with cool components! Plays best with 3+ players.

Actually; as a 6-player game it deserves a raing of 9!

Hmm...well, I'm no big AoS fan, so you have to take that into account here.  This has 80% of what AoS has.  So, it is not really "AoS-lite" - more AoS midi.

The faults that AoS has, for me, are mainly repeated here.  This comes down to the facts that it doesn't score well for me as either a brain burner or a as fun game.  As a  brain-burner it gets too repetitive and mathematical; in fun terms, it gets kind of dull at the end - rinse and repeat...just ship a load of stuff for as much as you can.  Ok, so the other train game that's mega popular here (TtR) does the same (keep drawing cards), but somehow that game is more fun to play than this...probably because until the end you always have something you can do, like draw new routes or end the game early, or score 15 pointers. Granted TtR is about 40% as deep as this (depends on the version), but it's about 500% more fun.  Here, the last third kind of plays itself - you've made your bed (track is laid) and you just endlessly ship stuff to make it (your point score) as cosy as you can.

Yet, I feel that this is marginally better than AoS.  I don't like the huge board (I'd shave 20% off of it) which makes me feel that I need to stand and move around to get perspective, or the silly, badly designed scoring track and I don't think that the cards add that much other than a bit of extra confusion.  On the other hand, the share system is better here and I also slightly prefer the handling of the turns and since the bidding doesn't seem to matter much I think that helps the game balance a little (even if the bidding can be dull as a result).

Overall, I think "the joys" of the AoS-type system have mainly escaped me.  I remain distinctly uninspired by either.

Update: 2009 10 07: I downgraded this a bit. Now that Steam is out, I have a game with the parts I like about RRT without the parts I found questionable. RRT is still a very fun game, but the length, size and wonkiness (particularly with USA board) makes it somewhat less attractive to play. 

Despite the fact that the board is too big, the board warps and some colours are hard to distinguish, this is a VERY fun game which is VERY pretty to look at. Mechanics are simple without being simplistic. This is a great game to use when trying to lead someone beyond "gateway" games such as Ticket to Ride or Carcassonne because it's quite straighforward yet there is depth there.

Seems to be the most accessible pick up and deliever train game, it feels balanced until you get to the secret objectives, the game should probably be played without them. Plus have a fully auctioned turn order rather than just the first player each round.

This is my favorite train game overall. yes I really love ticket to ride but this game takes that and adds more options to your play.  Not only do you have to figure out your routes but you have to ship the goods to make money. Also don't forget to upgrade your trains, pay attention to how much debt your collecting, get special cards to give you more overall abilities AND you can bid on your play order. I really enjoy the step up from the beginner level games like TTR.

There are soooo many cool things you could do with a train game.  Think about it: you could have dinosaurs drive those trains.  You could have lasers mounted on your trains.  You could have Johnny Cash in it.  Any of which would be so cool, you couldn't HELP but to get a 10 rating out of it.

So what do we do?  We create a crappy Euro with your typical moronic Euro-theme.  My city turns out, let's say, TVs.  My TVs are popular, so I sell out of all of them.  What do I do?  I borrow money so that I can expand my production and make MORE TVs, right?  No.  I STOP SELLING THEM!  I ran out of cubes.  I can't make any more.  How much pot does one have to smoke in order to believe this?  Seriously?  

Look, I can work with some things: let's say the dinosaurs on my train hopped off and rampaged through your city, eating everyone in sight and using their laser guns to destroy every TV.  Let's say Johnny Cash got tired of hearing that whistle blowing, so he led a prison breakout at Folsom and they looted your city and stole your TVs.  Fine.  THAT, I can work with (and admit it: both options would be so awesome).  

But no, we don't do that.  We move our cubes from city to city and collect monopoly money and pay off our mortgages, or some type of Euro-crappy-nonsense.  And worst of all, unlike your typical 45-minute Ticket to Ride-type of Euro that has nothing to do with anything, you are on the hook for a few hours with this turd.

So much you could do with a train theme. :shake:

FAIL.

This games is really excellent. it is not in the same "weight" category as Age of Steam but that means it is more accessible. It also has the feel of a family games. One caveat: remove the bonus card to upgrade to a 4-link train when playing with 2. The Geek variants where it is suggested to reduce the board size for 2 players work really nicely too.
Edit: After many more plays, a couple of clumsy things still grate: the unclear rules esp. governing the bonus cards; the ability to block someone's half-finished track; and the Start card issue mentioned above. For those reasons I have downgraded my rating from 9.4 to 8.5!

Surprisingly, this is a very approachable game, that could have been a gateway game, save for the play length.

Production values of the components are great, with a beautiful board and bits.

The game is tense, thanks to bidding and the racing to lay track, reach towns, deny opponents and snag goal cards.

The Eastern US board seems unbalanced, but I guess this is naturally corrected by player experience. I would need more plays to know for certain.

The variable income track also helps in shaping a satisfying game progression arc.

One of the best entry level train/pick-up and delivery games.

Rating based on three plays: each time one of us made the first three objective (first delivery, first delivery across three cities, first to get the fourth level locomotive) and went on winning with a huge advantage (more than 15 points above the second place).Clearly we're still learning how to play, but it looks like catching on a runaway leader is more or less impossible. Still a good and fun game.
After three more plays I can confirm that catching the leader is impossible (unless you get very lucky with cards).

Love this game, have had several plays of Railroad Tycoon in addition, which is essentially the same game.

Really gives you the feeling of building a successful economic engine, and is not too unforgiving (as is my understanding of how AoS plays, without having ever played). Simple mechanic, but deep game play. Random setup gives a fresh feeling for every game.

Very good, very clean track building and resource delivering game. I do wish there was a little bit more you could do with your money or debt to make things more interesting, but the special action cards add at least a little bit extra decision content to the game state.

I like that the design is intuitive and have enjoyed every play so far. But part of that is that I've had access to a wide variety of maps to play with that change the feel of every game. The system itself can feel a bit samey a bit too quickly in my opinion without the availability of more maps.

It's one of my favorite games. Both on the computer and the board game. It's got great game mechanics. Easy to learn. Few extras that doesn't really make someone win or loose. I've got the first release, and the board got a few flaws. The blue is too similar to black and purple, and it bends/warps so you get huge gaps. This doesn't ruin the gaming experience at all.

Tip: you need a large table to play on. An average kitchen table is not wide enough. It's bigger than a game of Twilight Empirium.

Components in excellent condition- game only been played 3 or 4 times.

Box has some whitening and a couple of areas where the covering has slightly separated from the structure of the box. It is incredibly heavy so I assume it is shelf wear. There are photos of the whole box and the areas mentioned. The structure of the box itself is fine. Links to photos;

Gran juego de entrega y reparto de mercancias, con unos maravillosos componentes, poquitas reglas .

The epic still waiting to be unpacked.  Tried a two player game, it was like playing Marbles at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

Played with 4 but still too sparse.  It was good, but this really needs five or six.  I think I'll use Rails of Europe for less than 5.  

Finally played with five - it was good but a couple of AP players can really slow thing down...

Different enough experience from AOS to warrant keeping both.

The only reason I would turn down a game of Railroad Tycoon is because it's so big and takes awhile to play. Other than that this is Ticket to Ride on steroids. You build your own tracks, manage money and ship cubes. I would have to say it's the most perfect train game in existence. Not as difficult as crayon train games, but complex enough to be strategically intersting. Very impressive in public places with three boards.

I can really only compare this to Steam, but I can safely say that I really like both games.  Each game has its own merits and even though I already own Steam, I can see myself picking this up in the future.

What makes these games so great for me is that the choices presented are all well integrated with the theme, they give players a large variety of options each turn and they challenge players but not in a way I find too brain burning.

Gameplay for railways is nice and simple (with a helpful card/ player aid to remind players of options each turn).  The rail baron cards and ease of laying track makes this game an easy step up from games such as Ticket to Ride, while still providing some familiar mechanics and goals.  The Railroad Operation cards allow for some spontaneity to keep both the game and player tactics fresh.  I especially like how various card powers can be combo'd (Perfect Engineering + Government Grant).  But as much as I like the cards, they also create some really lucky situations for various players whose tracks and strategies line up with card requirements better.  I also don't like how goods replaced are random.  The Western link rules are also a bit of a bother to explain, especially with new gamers.  With that being said however, I still find the game very engaging and very fun.

The components in Railways are almost perfect.  I have issues with the track tiles being the same type of track on both sides and with the lack of tight turn track tiles (which would have been useful in a number of instances).  The players' train components are all great, but some of the empty city makers are a bit oversized.  Additionally the card graphics indicating bonus points for various links are really unclear (as in the resolution on the cards are too low that some values are unreadable).

Overall, Railways of the World is a great game, one which I find a little more lucky than Steam, but a whole lot more accessible especially to newer gamers.  I hope to be able to acquire a copy of this soon.

I have a weakness for railroad games.  This does nothing to cure it.  It plays quickly and smoothly.
My only rap is for a game with such quality parts, I would have thought that Eagle would have provided storage containers within the box.  And the date of the "currency" is about 30-40 years after the historical game dates (1830-1880).  (What a nit-picker!)

Played AoS a long time ago, didn't really like it.  Played Steam a while ago, didn't really like it.  Haven't played RRT.  What made the difference with RWOTW?  I don't know.  Maybe the action cards?  Hard to say.  Maybe the core scoring just hadn't clicked as a point of interest for me in the past.  I feel like it's opened up the whole game series to me, though, to the point that I now want to go back and retry the others.  Really enjoyed my one and only play of this (using the England map, with normal rules).

RATING: 6
A "lighter" version of Age of Steam with nice components and chrome.  Play is lighter for 2 primary reasons - money planning and goods.  In Railroad Tycoon, stocks can be taken as money is needed, thus reducing the planning required.  All goods are placed on the board prior to start of game.  This gives  the game a bit of predetermined-ness.  The new element in Tycoon are cards.  The Tycoon card helps new player form initial plans but is not really needed for more experienced players.  Other cards introduce an element of randomness; especially when area specific cards are turned up that are only truly viable for 1 or 2 players.  Overall the game has a nice glossy feel, but lacks the tighter and cleaner design of Age of Steam.  [GTI Code: TPCD]

A good light railroad game with plenty of plastic.  It's a good introduction to deeper games for non-gamers.

Unfortunately I was spoiled by my first rail game being 1856, and everything else is measured against that.  Also the New England part of the board is very strong.  For more balance I usually play other expansion maps.

2016:  We play that you can't collect two cards, first route delivered and first to a specific city at the same time.  That is simply too powerful. 

2012:  I really like Railroad Tycoon as a series, but think that the New England Map is too unbalanced around the NE passage.  However this reworking handles that issue by including a map of Mexico.

This game sucks.

The board sucks - "Did I cross that river? I can't tell."

The theme sucks - trains are boring.

The length sucks - 3 hours!  You know how many Puerto Rico's we could have fit in in that time?

The cards suck - "Build a stupid-long, easily-sabotaged rail line that you won't even use to ship anything...for 5 victory points!"

I hate you, Railroad Tycoon.  You are anti-fun.

Un juegazo. Siempre me apetece. El mundillo de los trenes tiene algo mágico, y si encima es de los de vapor pues más. 
El juego es, a mi parecer, perfecto. Muchísima interacción, sencillo y lógico de explicar, componentes estupendos, misiones especiales secretas... endeudamiento perfectamente estudiado dentro de la mecánica del juego, todo funciona... un pero: el lado del este en el tablero está descompensado. Muchisimas ciudades muy cercanas entre sí y de muchos tipos que hace que si se lo come sólo uno gane la partida por la cara. Suelo jugar este juego siempre enseñando las reglas así que soy yo el que procura usar este lado para contrarestar al jugador que ha escogido esta elección. 
Por lo demás un juegazo, super recomendable. Recuerdo que lo estrenamos y se nos quedó a tdos una sonrisa especial en la cara.... ya sabes a que me refiero, verdad?

Huge board, slightly larger than necessary - but why have the cities which such confusing colours?  A lighter version of Age of steam.

Nem panaszkodhatom, volt anyag a dobozban:) Nagyon jó játék, egyetlen bajom azzal van, ahogyan (és amilyen váratlanul) véget ér:) Nagyon el lehet szállni a részvényekkel (jó ötlet a részvény és a pénz ilyen szétválasztása), ha az elején túlköltekezünk, annak terhét végig viseljük, ezért nem célszerű kapkodni és mohónak lenni. Amúgy a játékmenet precízen ki van találva, és nem is olyan ijesztően hosszú, mint azt előtte vártam tőle. És nem utolsó sorban szép is. Szívesen játszom vele újra.

A magyarítás elég érdekesre sikerült: a német kiadás le volt takarva egy magyar nyelvű lappal, a kártyák és a szabály tökéletesen magyar volt a játékban, a tábla és a doboz német... érdekes felemás megoldás. De nekem bőven elég lenne a legtöbb játék ilyen felemás magyarul is...

Pros:
1. I love the train markers!
2. I like that the track tiles are much smaller than those in AoS.
3. All the cubes are on the board.
4. I like that you can build, deliver, buy train in any order and number that you want.

Cons:
1. Board too big because you don't use a whole third of the board.
2. For such a big board the NE is always full of people and is like a sixth of the whole board.
3. The cities are so far apart that there is so much dead space around the tracks connecting cities.  Also since cities are so far from each other and the board so huge, it is very hard to try to stop the leader because it will cost you the game if you try to build tracks to where he/she is.
4. The auction for turn order I find to be a huge flaw.  2nd place gets a silver plate for free and the last gets shafted because the player to his left wants to be first all the time.
5. One has to know all the possible major lines in the deck to do well.  Also the fact that you can complete major lines before it is available provides a lot of confusion on who gets it etc.  The biggest problem I have with major lines is that it rewards people for doing something they should be doing anyways.  Major lines gives you points for connecting various cities with your tracks.  Building that infrastructure to set you up for deliveries is enough reward/incentive for you to do.  Getting points/income for the sake of building is just over the top.  
6. The rules for building over river is tedious.  One must always check if there is a river/mountain under a track tile to see if the next player that wants to build in the same hex has to pay for the extra costs.
7. With less than 6 players the game is too open and does not provide enough tension or urgency to do things before anyone else.
8. Unless every player knows the value of the NE then the game will be skewed.  Either not enough competition in the NE that gives those guys a benefit or too much competition that they end up shooting each other on the foot.
9. Some Tycoon cards are just inherently better than others and easier to meet.

Wow. I knew that I didn't want to play the game anymore, but actually listing the Pros and Cons really help you build your resolve.

I had very good memories of this game after my first and only play of it (up to now), but after playing it 7 years later it turns out that I don't like it as much now.

A great route building/shipping game. Quite a bit of depth for relatively simple premise. Choices consist of building routes, shipping, upgrading locomotive, and a few other choices.

The easiest of Martin Wallace's railroad building games comes with deluxe components: every game is a joy for the eyes! It's quite easy to learn, but doesn't lack strategy.
The game has some flaws (better: some random mechanics have been introduced to 'tone down' Age of Steam difficult gameplay and making the game more accessible for a wider audience) but I can't avoid to be excited at the idea of playing... Ain't this the symptoms of a great game? Or is it just the kid inside me rejoying at the idea of toying with little trains?

Version is Out of Print (OOP).

Finally got down to tabling this game after a long while. We had been playing quite a bit of Ticket to Ride and I thought it is about time to showcase this.

We played the simple version without the Western Link and the new players enjoyed themselves. We had a mixed 5 player session and I will think that everyone enjoyed themselves.

Looking forward to getting this played more often and trying out the Europe map again.

Initial Impression: Although this game shares a name with the computer game, aside from theme there's little similarity between the two.

I think it would work as a gateway game.

I printed out the color corrected blue cities on mailing labels and applied to my board. No problem with warpage though. After a game and a half I'm pretty in love with this one and will probably be pushing to play it at every chance.

Excellent second level entry game for people that like train board games.  The components and rules are very well done and everything looks gorgeous.  Just make sure you play at least 4+ players on the US map or it is not a whole lot of fun.  

The mexico map supplied extra with the game though makes an excellent 2-3 player game and with the cards created by a fan here on BGG makes it even more competitive.


*Update*  The second printing of this game is just gorgeous and adds the extra deck for the mexico map already.  You cannot go wrong getting this game if you are a Boardgame train lover.

Our absolute new favorite!  Why?  Before I actually played, I had some reservations about playing a "train" game--give me a military simulation--but I'm glad I did.  We had a blast.  My wife won so she was sold on the game.  Purchased it with some Christmas $$$ and have since taught five more people to play, with other friends and their spouses lined up.  Positive feedback from all who play.  Everyone wants to play some more.  OK! [Market price]

Enjoyable with the right number of players. Shame that the board would be too big for my kitchen table. New players can unbalance things a bit and giving one player too much space will throw them the game. Bidding only for first player can be annoying if the "wrong" players (usually those on your right) bid.

Rails of Europe fixes some of the (minor) issues I have with game play, particularly with the cards.

"Basic" Steam is a far better entry to this style of game - rating downgraded accordingly.

[i]Posted: 4/8/07, Rated: 9[/i]

The verdict is in: I love train games.  No, that's not an invitation to exhume the worn-out debate over the definition of a train game.  Trains have universal appeal.  I like the theme.  My family enjoys it, and my friends enjoy it.  That's good enough for me.

[i]Railroad Tycoon[/i] was the next logical step after [i][thing=9209]Ticket to Ride[/thing][/i] and [i][thing=94]Union Pacific[/thing][/i].  [i]Railroad Tycoon[/i] provides additional layers of complexity by allowing players to lay out their tracks, instead of providing pre-printed segments.  Set collection isn't a part of [i]Railroad Tycoon.[/i]  Segments, or "links" as they're called, are not exclusive: it is possible for other players to use your rails, to your benefit.

Efficiently building your infrastructure, managing your debt, and delivering the desired goods to each city is the core of this game.  Each one of those items sounds like it is complicated, but Wallace pulls it all off with aplomb.  The rules feel very streamlined, and are easy to understand.  Once a few example turns have been provided, most new players are ready to jump in with both feet.

Production values abound, almost to the point of being ostentatious.  The box is [i]huge,[/i] and heavy with components.  Players use various hex counters to lay out their tracks.  Obviously that is not a problem for veteran gamers, but the eyes of new gamers can gloss over when faced with their first hex map.  The map itself is gargantuan, having three, tri-fold sections which are laid together on the table.  I think that I have a fairly large dining room table, and the full game board does fit, although there isn't a lot of extra room along the sides.  Side note: four small (3/4") binder clips work very well to hold the board together during play.

[i]Railroad Tycoon[/i] is a superbly produced, engaging strategy game with streamlined rules, and a romantic theme.  It does appeal, but its sheer size can be intimidating.  I admit to loving train games.  Despite my enthusiasm, [i]Railroad Tycoon[/i] hasn't been as well received as [i][thing=9209]Ticket to Ride[/thing][/i] or [i][thing=94]Union Pacific[/thing][/i].  A game that receives a "10" should be perfection, so [i]Railroad Tycoon[/i] earns a well-deserved and respectable "9."

This is an excellent game. High detail but not too complicated. It's easy to bring your friends into and always good fun battling of the best routes. It is very pleasant to play by the looks of it and while i bought it for my friend more by fun then expecting a really good game it was a very nice suprise we could enjoy this game as much as we did. So far it's proven fun with any number of players and the scoring system makes good work to balance gametime even with 5 plus players and still keeping it fun.

The only minor downside is that you need a good large playing area, preferably a big table or two combined, but once you have that set up it never fails to stay fun.

The game so big it took 3 boards to fit it on the table! Railroad Tycoon is just fun, fun, fun to play. Sure, the bits to mark closed cities are completely superfulous (but they look so cool!), you have to stand up when it's your turn to reach wherever you want to lay track down, and the auction system to determine starting player order doesn't really seem to fit, but it's still awesome!! Make headway in the Northeast faster then the other players and you'll have this game in the bag.

I love train games and this one did not disappoint. Lots of choices to pick from and like many other Martin Wallace games, there is more you want to do than actions available. My wife enjoys the game as well.

Update: This would probably get played more often if the gameboard weren't so huge. I keep thinking that I should pick up Railways of the World but haven't to this point. (Obviously, this comment was entered before Railroad Tycoon and Railways of the World were combined).

RATING: N/A
So this is what a real train game is like.  There is a lot going on here, and the rules-prodding done by the players of the game I was in seem to prove that the game is very well play-tested.  Attempts to "break" the game did not turn out well.  :)  And after reading through AoS experiences and using the certificates in RRT, I can entirely believe that the certificates are much kinder---although as part of our game showed, they aren't entirely a safety net.  There is certainly a lot of game exploration that can be done even after many multiple plays, and as such, this game is a great investment for serious gamers.  Especially gamers who have never played a train game.

Oh man.  I really want to like this game, but it is hindered by a concentration of influence in the New England part of the board.  This would be a great game if it did not have this map/city distribution problem.  Seriously, is there ANY reason to hook into Dallas or the SW at all?  A glaring problem that detracts from what could have been a great game.

Four playings, with 5 and 6.  It has good and bad points - I like the free action selection and the open issuing of shares.  I have hated the tycoon cards generally, but the last game we played without them and I kinda missed 'em.  A good alternative to Age of Steam, but I think AoS packs more gaming goodness into a shorter timeframe.  OTOH, I think RRT is probably a better game for the larger number of players (5 or 6), but then I prefer my games less confrontational...

I can't help comparing this game to Age of Steam, which I enjoy, at every angle. In my one four-player session, I felt no pressure at all for at least the first half of the game. We all had workable networks set for the game by the time two people even touched the same city. Drawing into lucrative already-or-nearly-accomplished goals was almost common, which seemed a bit lame. Additionally, the mechanics of shares posed no financial pressure whatsoever; they are too flexible.

Ei oikeen kunnon mielipidettä vielä. Eka peli kesti törkeen kauan, mukana oli useampi muukin ensikertalainen. Siitä jäi kyllä paha maku suuhun.

After many more plays, it's still a good game for sure, but I'd really only consider playing it with 4 or 5 people.

Very enjoyable railroad game. Mechanisms feel very much like a Euro game. Ruleswise it's not so difficult to grasp. Recognizing the opportunities on the board from the cube distribution is something else. Knowing what to bid makes this a very good medium level game. Looks very nice but the map colors are horrible.

I used to say that this game was far too big and goofy for what it is. But my last play changed my opinion on that. I actually quite like the forgiving nature of RRT compared with Age of Steam.

Maybe after I master doing really well at RRT I will desire the unforgiving nature of AOS. I'm just not there yet. I need to master the art of planning a long delivery ahead of time. And then master the art of planning a long delivery ahead of time while competing in the same region with others.

Having played Steam and Age of Steam, this is a lighter, less tense, more random version of that game, but still with interesting decisions. The production values are great and it gave me the Ameritrashy feel by the looks of the components.

RATING: 6
The fun part about this game is the choices you have to make in order to get you the most points. The problem with this game I find is that because it had to follow closely to the real map of North America, the east side of the board allows a person to gain a lot of points if they control that area. It gives a distinctive advantage.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The person with the a lot of shares (12) and the person with the fewest shares (me, 2) tied in victory points, but as can be expected, the person with the fewest shares had more money left and won the tie-breaker. I refrained from building in the Northeast and I got the first player token to get osme very valuable cards like land grants at the beginning of the game.

I am a big fan of Wallace's games in general, but this one is one of his best.  Terrific engine building game (pun intended) that has a lot of variability and tension.  Has a small catchup mechanism as some players creep past the mid-point of the scoring board.  The bond system is brilliant.

Finally!  I enjoyed this game as much as AoS.  Obviously, comparisons should be made, but in reality, RRT has a very different feel than AoS.  I feel that RRT conveys the theme better.  AoS is tighter financially (potential of going bankrupt) but that doesn't mean that it is simpler than RRT.  It means that everyone sticks in the game and can potentially work out their grand plan (even if they lose because they have too many shares out - like I did).  I do think the smaller board in AoS might make it a quicker game...I can't imagine playing 2 or 3 players on that huge board.  RRT is one that I will play again and teach to some of those who haven't played AoS.

I don't like Age of Steam and I don't like RRT even more.  It removes the horrible role and production system only to then neuter the turn order auction and add the extremely random operations cards.  All of this pales in comparison to the fact that Eagle Games forgot to include a game here.  The board is so massive that each player can ignore the other players with little detriment and we played a 6 player game.  Great bits, except for the overproduced empty city markers that obstruct cities.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is a really great game that so far appears to scale very well from 2 up to 6 players.  With fewer people you have more room to play, and your rail empires end up much larger.  With more players the game is much more cutthroat and tactical.  I love the way that game strategies can change so much based on the goods cube distribution and card draws.  The only downside is the length - this can get out of hand, especially with 6 players.  4-5 players seems to be the sweet spot.

This game would have been an eight or a nine if not for its many problems.

Things that suck about Railroad Tycoon:
- Its turn order auction system is terrible.
- Most of the meaningful analysis that's done during the game is done right after the cubes are placed on the board.  The rest of the game plays itself.
- It has a horrendous amount of setup time.  When compared to this game, Puerto Rico looks like Othello.
- Most of the cards you see during the game are seen right at the beginning, compounding the second problem.
- The roller coaster income track was a nice idea, but was poorly implemented.  In most games, you don't earn enough VPs to see your income plummet, and even when you do, you're unlikely to have monetary problems by the end of the game.
- With a typical cube distribution, if one person starts in the northeast, he's in great shape, but if two people start there, they're both screwed.

With 4p, the game board is too large since it allows for 1-2 players to avoid competition for routes.  With 5-6p, the game is more balanced.

Nice idea to issue stock and paying dividends to shareholders. Should be able to reimburse capital though. 
The first few turns can turn out quiet decisive for the rest of the game. The colours of the cities on the board are not easy to match with the "goods" (wooden tokens), creating a lot of confusion.

I _ALWAYS_ feel like I am doing so well in this game... up to the final few turns! I have not yet mastered the vision it takes to see the biggest deliveries and most profitable networks.  I'm still working at that! The game feels just a little too long, but that is probably just my lack of long term strategy talking ;-) All of the alternate maps with different niches for number of players and length of game make this appropriate every game night.

Normally, licensed games are terrible, but I've been impressed with this one.  Maybe it's because they just pasted the name onto a solid Train game instead of basing it around the license itself.

Regardless, the strategy is deep and highly interactive.  There are always critical decisions to be made.  If only it played more quickly it would be further up the list.

Update (Sep 11): Two more expansion maps are now available for RRT/RotW - Western USA (for up to six players)and Mexico (2-3 players) along with a series-wide event deck and some new elements ("rotor" cities and fuel depots). These have all been positive additions and I am becoming more appreciative of the game for its accessibility and just plain fun factor. More random elements than its cousins surely, but I find I'm enjoying it more than I did before. Based on the fixes and re-design that went into "Railways of the World," my rating has gone back up. I still believe that "Steam" is a better "gamer's game" but I'm happy to play RRT/RotW anytime.

Update (Sep 09): With the arrival of "Steam: Rails to Riches" from Martin Wallace out of Mayfair Games, I have downgraded RRT. "Steam" is now the game you want if AoS is a bit too harsh for you. However, if you are partial to the "Rails of the World" series (first exp was "Rails of Europe," next was "Railways of England and Wales"), you may wish to keep RRT to be able to play those (or hope they can be modified to use the "Steam" system).

The title might suggest a reference to Sid Meier's classic PC game with a similar title. In my view, the game is really inspired by Martin Wallace's "Age of Steam" and was co-designed by him (no report of Sid having anything to do with it). It is the finest game that Eagle Games has yet produced in its brief existence. It is on one level very like AoS until you get into the finer details.

Gone are the roles and the nail-biting financial tight-rope (here, you can issue more shares anytime you need extra cash). Added are bonus VP cards and Tycoon cards that assist in pushing you along besides simply delivering goods cubes to similar colored cities. The track laying is very similar, and urbanization, upgrading choo-choos and adding extra goods cubes are all there but implemented in different ways.

The map board is huge! You better check the dimensions before you commit to playing on your dining room table. You get a big box here and it is stuffed (altho with a lot of plastic that plays no real role in the game other than to provide three-dimensional color).

A much more accessible game than AoS and quite a bit more random, yet retaining a lot that made AoS fun while adding some additional fun elements of its own. I have both games and have no hesitation playing either.

RATING: 9
Cleaned up version of Railroad Tycoon. Some of the "tweaking" that went into the first two expansions have been reverse engineered back into the base game and it is the better for it. Some of the operation cards have been fixed and the method for choosing the Baron cards improved.

The map has been improved graphically and adjusted slightly around New Orleans, again, for the better. It has also been made smaller by the removal of the scoring track from around the outside (and removing some superfluous graphics). But, you now need the separate scoring track as an additional board to set up beside the map, so you still need a lot of real estate to play this game.

Because of the mysterious way ratings are derived here, this game rates below its progenitor despite being distinctly better. I hope that will eventually age out. This game should now be at least in the top thirty on the Geek meter.

RATING: 10
Railways was introduced to me a couple of years ago and it has taken up a regular place among the games we play very frequently. It can be a bit long and have some analysis paralysis problems, but the various expansions with smaller boards help that issue. Plus this reprinted version comes with the Mexico map, which is great for two players. 

It even holds up well for tournament and competitive play, as I've tried that at GenCon the past two years. About the only downside is that I believe with the major lines on the Eastern U.S. map, there are only two truly valid strategies for winning a 5-6 player game. With such an open world design, it should be easier to compete without having to play the same way every time. But that's just one map and really is not a concern on other maps and expansions. We love this game series and will continue to play it for years. 

However, just because some guys who played the map 100 times have solved it under a particular rules set does not mean the game is not worth your time. On the contrary, you will likely find hours and hours of enjoyment here. This is my favorite "heavy" board game to show to people, as it is simple enough to grasp but difficult to master. Kind of like chess in that way.

First Eagle that I have rated.  Soooo re-playable, always fun, and competitive.  Great gateway game.

Some criticisms seem justified but are truly minor (warping, wasted space, not enough space for the scoring, and blue/ purple color similarity).  

Some criticisms are valid, but easily tweaked by adjusting the rules to fit your preference (cards, length of the game).

An excellent update of Railroad Tycoon.  The Railways of Mexico map is ok, better with the PnP cards you can find here on the geek.  The greatest thing about this game is it takes a great game (Steam), and makes it really accessible.  The cards also make the game very forgiving.

EDIT: Even though I like Steam better, THIS is the game that can get to the table.  Have to give it points for that.

I've played this game about a half-dozen times and it is one of my favorites.  It is a gamer's game and has a steep learning curve.  I can now play "competitively" but still have only been in first place once (and that was about midway through one game).  To me, this game defines Euro with a few simple choices that result in a game of great complexity.  The only reason this isn't on my buylist is because I'm waiting for Steam.

1 4p game, 1 5p game.  Loved it!  Lots of decisions, and definitely has depth that grows on you - as you learn the game, you start by playing against the game (how can I best optimize what I have).  Later, you play against the other players (how can I use what I think they'll do to get me a few more points).  Good blend of strategy and tactics, and accessible to non-gamers as long as they are patient non-gamers.  We found proper play made the game longer (as we got close to the end, everyone not in the lead tried to replenish cities to give themselves a chance to keep up), which I think is a weakness.  I would like a variant with a better end game condition.

Juego de transportar mercancías y hacerte un nombre en el mundo del ferrocarril en 1830, en el este de USA, en plena eclosión de esa industria. Está muy interesante, por ejemplo, cómo se gestiona el dinero. Se emiten acciones que en cada turno hay que abonar. Durante el juego, tienes que ir mejorando tu locomotora, para poder transportar cubitos por un mayor número de enlaces, e ir construyendo nuevos enlaces. 

Mi primera partida fue a cinco jugadores y había oido hablar que el número optimo del juego son seis. Lo pasé en grande. Me gusta el juego. Además, es facil de explicar y asimiliar. Bastante familiar.

it seems to me the cards are unbalanced, and whoever gets the right card at the beginning of the game gets a nearly uncatchable headstart over the other players.  i also don't care for the board layout; it doesn't seem nearly as well thought out as say, the Ticket to Ride routes.  However, I'm told that these complaints will go away with subsequent playings and that I should try it again; so perhaps my rating will go up.

All the chrome really gets in the way of the actual GAME for me.  Empty city markers obscure cubes, trains marking score are too easily bumped, and the accursed board is about 3/8" too wide for my table, ensuring that the whole board gets moved every time somebody has to put anything on the board!  It's definitely much more accessible for casual gamers, but I'd rather play Age of Steam and focus on the underlying mechanics.  Sold it to a friend.

A little lengthy at 2 and a half hours, but that was for six players. Two of us were new to the game, with one coming in last (myself) and the other in first! I did not care for the card selection, since there were too few for the six player game we played. They seemed to provide too much advantage to those able to pick them ahead of the other players. Seemed a bit crowded too with 6, but it depended on where you were building track in relation to the other players, even on this big board. It seemed too long, and success rested on whether a player built close to your lines or an opponent's lines. Played well the second game with 4 players, but I think the board is too big and may need five. The expansion Rails of Europe, however, does very well with 4 players and I prefer it to the base game.

I do enjoy this game, even though I'm truly rubbish at it.  If I do well in a game of this, it's because a lucky option card suddenly became available which no-one else wanted.  Otherwise, I'm goosed by poor planning and, invariably, severe debt from the very start.  I find a few things frustrating about the game however: not least being that it takes just slightly too long for a convenient evening's play. Also, it has an unfeasibly large board -- which is still too small for the game! And while the pieces are all very attractive, they're slightly too big, especially the indutrialised city markers; they can conceal the information on the hexes.

Age of Steam is my favorite game, so why play Railroad Tycoon instead? Despite being very similar games, tension is surprisingly lacking in RT. The cards seem too random, i.e. they benefit some players more than others for no reason. The turn order rule (Agricola-like) is simply terrible; fortunately it can be easily houseruled to be like in AoS. Lastly, the map is so big you will need a huge table to play on.

Reasonable game but my main gripe with all the Age of Steam and new train games is they actually are NOT train games. They are in fact cube pushing Euro's masquerading as a train game. Give me a real stock market, crashes, epic track construction and ability to own and manage your own company anytime. In an effort to accelerate and smooth out play, all the above mechanisms from the original 1830xx series have been removed. So take your pick which u prefer.

  Excellent game that will continue to produce variety in a players strategy, game after game, due to the 'Tycoon' card mission and the random placement of commodities across the board during set-up (all players can survey the board for ideas before the game begins).
  For a group of 20-something game geeks slamming pepsi's and hershey bars at the local RPG store 'til midnight this game will be too light.  But, this is a nod to its strength.  The rules are easy enough to get a family playing in ten minutes and complex enough to pull them into the world of gaming.  Victory Points and the multiphase turn are staples of medium-heavy games and the exposure of it in this game is clean and easily understood. 
  While you could call it a good gateway game it's more important to see it as a well developed game that generates a good tension and is a lot of fun.  There is always more to do than you have moves to do it. And boy, do I like trains!!

I really like Railroad Tycoon.  It took everything I really liked from Age of Steam (pick up & deliver, track building) and then made it so you could issue shares at any time rather than trying to figure out and budget what you need ahead of time only to find it all exploding in your face.  The variable event cards are thrown in and the freedom of choices are made much more wide open and voila you have an excellent railroad game that sits in complexity halfway between Union Pacific/Ticket to Ride and EuroRails/Empire Builder and the other crayon rail games.  After my second play the rating stays the same but I have to make the following comments:  the game plays better with 6 than with 4 (5 would probably be better than 4 as well, and 3 not so good) as there needs to be more competition in the game.  Also, the game feels like it ends too soon.  Last of all, I wish there were more cards in the game that come out.  The cards and the competition drive the auction for turn order and without enough cards and without enough competition why bid?  Better yet, just play with 5 or 6.  Last of all, the $30,000 western links seem like a bad investment.  I haven't tried it yet so I could be wrong.

RATING: 8
I enjoyed this much more than I thought I would. I thought the scoring system for deliveries was well designed and I liked how there were both secret and public goals to shoot for during your turn: it was neat to try to guess what other players were aiming for while simultaneously competing for the special card bonuses. 

I wish there were a way to deliver more than one cube at a time, and upgrading your train is a seriously annoying but necessary aspect of the game. I'd love to see a stock system introduced like in Chicago Express, but the game is fine as it is. For now it's probably my favorite train game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A streamlined version of Age of Steam with very pretty plastic bits.  I like that you can issue shares anytime you want (greatly reduces the number-crunching required in AoS) but the huge map makes the game pretty boring for anything less than 5 players.

As good as Age of Steam, but a bit more accessible and fun.  I will continue to play both.  Attractive map and trains, if you have the space, are an easy sell to company looking to play a game.
UPDATE:  Every time I play this game I like it more.  Win, lose, doesn't matter.  With this and AoEIII on the playlist, I could honestly drop about half of my heavy game collection.
UPDATE II:  You know, I don't really need to play Age of Steam anymore.

Update III:  I find myself playing Steam more often, now, because of its portability.

Rating after only one play with four players. I felt like I had quite a bit of control over the income aspect of the game, and I was able to stay solvent (and become the richest player) by only issuing one share during the whole game. But I didn't feel like there was much control over the building and transport aspects of the game, and the victory point system (mostly based on cumulative deliveries) didn't make much thematic sense to me. After all, wasn't this a business? Weren't the railroad tycoons mainly concerned with making money? The snatching up of commodities from under player's noses seemed appropriate given the setting, but the limited availability of routes did not. Why can there only be four tracks into Chicago? And only one into Dover? The game might be improved by allowing players to purchase victory points at the end of the game with cash on hand, based on the turn end dividends printed by the points. Thematically, this would be like selling the line and retiring. Also, sorting through the tiles to find the right sections of track slowed the game down more than it should have. This is an area where the crayon rail games have a clear advantage over the tile rail games. Anyway, Railroad Tycoon is not a game I would play often, but it's one I'm willing to play again.

Decent game but too big for its own good, with some curious design choices -   the watertowers look great on the board but too many of them obscure the hex they're placed on, which.  The changes from AOS don't simplify the game too much,  which is good, but the objective cards can be a bit OTT - losing out on a point here or there isn't a problem but building all the way from New York to the far west only to be pipped at the post and miss out on 20 points is likely to be make or break - which isn't great for a long game.  If you have the choice, pick up Steam instead.

UPDATE: With Steam: Rails to Riches now out from Mayfair, this game is not just mediocre but also obsolete. Steam finally gets this, if not right, at least pretty close to right. Time may show that the Mayfair version of this system has flaws too, but at least they aren't glaringly obvious.

Hmm. Does not appear to be seriously developed or playtested. I enjoy some of the improvements over Age of Steam, and it plays more quickly and more cleanly, and without the gratuitous difficulty of its predecessor. But, it's got a truly horrible runaway leader problem - last time we played, the standings did not change for the last two-thirds of the game. You have to have a strong start to win, and by strong start, I mean the first 2-3 turns. You can be completely screwed with no hope of winning before the halfway mark. The game really, really wants to be at least an hour shorter. And the various cards seem crazy unbalanced and the way they are brought out (a ton up front, then a trickle as the game goes on) seems a little nuts. And the various Tycoon cards are insanely random and unbalanced, although they are admittedly not likely to swing the game except amongst experienced players - but I doubt the game is really good enough that many players are going to get to that point.

So anyway, like everything from Eagle or Warfrog, it feels like it's at best about half baked. It's closer to being done than many of their games, which is not saying very much.

Played again on U.S. board and though I won I am still not a fan.  It was fairly clear to me who was competing for first and second by turn two or three (out of six players).

[07/11/05]Railroad Tycoon and Antike were great successes at our recent post-Essen gaming weekend. We're mostly Age of Steams veterans and very much enjoyed this reengineered version of Matin Wallace's masterpiece.

PROS

- HISTORY AND GEOGRAPHY

RT puts you in the shoes of the legendary "robber barons" and portrays the growth of the railway industry far more convingly than AoS seeks and manages to do. There is a true geographic dimension. The city density on the Eastern seaboard, the craggy Appalachians, the plentiful Mid-West etcetc. Of course, the far greater number of hexes and the 4 tile building limit enabled this all.

The railway operation cards and the Tycoon cards add further flavour. With RT you can relive American railway history much as with 1830. AoS - partly because of the standard map being confined to the Mid-West, partly because of its rules - never managed to offer that same experience I crave for.

- GRAPHICS

While I do find Eagle Games' graphics usually way too bombastic and poor taste, RT fortunately does not belong to that category. It's a pleasure to behold. It's almost as if you're building a miniature railway model!

- ECONOMIC SYSTEM

I personally like the income bell curve. A better solution than the taxes found in AoS. Also, it really makes a "few shares" strategy truly viable. Perhaps too much so. While in my very first game of RT I issued - following typical AoS-type expansive play - a whopping amount of 13 shares (and almost won in doing so), I haven't seen any similar strategy since. A pity. We're getting too disciplined for my taste. I very much hope that in the long run both financially displined and agressive strategies prove equally viable.

I dare say this ties in with RT lacking one of my favourite AoS elements: the fledgling railway companies need time and further capital to reach the break-even". Very nice simulation touch. I wish RT would have a tougher advanced economic system for those veterans enjoying this particular aspect of AoS. I dare say it won't be before long, before I start tinkering with various variants to this end...

- CUBE DISTRIBUTION AND ENDGAME CONDITION

The pre-game distribution of all goods save for those gained by urbanization or city growth is a considerable improvement over AoS. Reduces an unnecessary element of luck.

The endgame condition resulting from this change happens to be a stroke of genius. The variability actually allows for new player tactics. Well done.

- LESS AOS GAMEYNESS:

At times AoS was very gamey indeed, which worked against the "railway simulation" character of the game. While not going into the specifics, I do consider this less of a problem with RT.

CONS:

- The auction isn't nearly as interesting. The first and some of the following ones are interesting (particularly when valuable operation cards pop up), but I personally fail to see why much of the fun was taken out of the auctions. I like the fact that the old privileges have been turned into regular actions, but the introduction of the operations cards could have presented a sufficient substitute.

I'm presently considering a possible variant in which say 3-6 operation cards are added to the display each turn (depending on player number). Then the turn order is auctioned off in AoS style and players then can pick one card for free (save obviously those green ones).
Well, lots of variations along similar lines to consider...

The beauty of making the auction more important is of course that money becomes correspondingly tighter. After all, the more you spend on the auctions, the more shares will you need and the higher your liabilities will probably  be...

What else to I dislike or miss? Hm, I would have added a town or two here and there. For instance, one minor town in between Chootanooga (or however that place is spelt) and Virginia . Historically a railroad was built along that Appallachian valley. I don't really  see one built there in RT. A shame really. The game ought to make such historical routes viable.

As for the Western link, well, we haven't seen anyone use it in our three games this last weekend. I hope the option is attractive enough. Clearly a late game option. I just hope people will find it at times useful enough. Otherwise we might lower the price...

BOTTOM LINE:

I believe I prefer Railroad Tycoon. It is true: I miss the break even point, tighter finances and more interesting auctions from AoS, but the better simulation qualities win the day for me.

Anniversary Purchase (5/6/10)

Almost a year later and finally got it played!!!  What a waste of a year.  I feel the same after playing Power Grid.  This should have been played a lot sooner.  Only played Railways of Mexico and can see the similarities between this game and the Card Game and am excited to take it to the next level with Eastern US and the other 2 expansions I have (Western US and England).

Comes in at a strong 9.  (4/30/11)

Heading towards being our favourite game.  We need to see if it lasts as well as Power Grid has from us.  Another game where having all the expansion board keeps it interesting.  They could bring anything out and we will buy it.  Bring on ROTW: Catapult edition!  (actually let's not).

Deserves a 10 spot along with Catan: Cities and Knights, and Power Grid!  (7/1/11)

This game is Age of Steam lite.  It took the best parts of Age of Steam to make a faster game, which is good because the game is so tactical.  I'm still not really a fan of either one.  I think whoever gets the least competition will win, and competition with someone can have an adverse affect on your position.  So you either let them win, or take them out of it with yourself and let someone else win.  The blocking is significant, and if somebody decides to battle you hard, you might as well give up.  I made the analogy using a beautiful mild tactical game with little screwage, Through the Desert.  I said that this type of game is like Through the Desert, except you get to place 8 camels instead of 2 on your turn.  Do you see the problems with that?  At least it is only 90 minutes and the board is beautiful, although freaking hard to play.  That is why this gets half a point higher than Age of Steam.

This is a stunner with 6 people. I don't know how it would play with less than 5, but everything in this game works beautifully. Great blend of fun and strategy. Different enough from Age of Steam to warrant owning both. I just love this system in general. Have to dock a point for the size. I could never play this in my house. Also, the timing of when the cards come out seems poorly thought out. I hope AoS 3rd edition finally gets the system 'right'. 

Rails of Europe is a big improvement on this game, more of a fix than an expansion.

I like Age of Steam, but my main complaint was always that the artwork could have really enhanced the game.  As it is, the Age of Steam art seems like it was done by a mechanical engineer with very dry tastes.
When I heard Railroad Tycoon was being done by Martin Wallace, I thought this would be perfect--- a simplified AoS with great bits to tempt non-gamers.  Unfortunately, the problem with the blue and purple cubes and cities is a big problem to me and some of the people I've played this with.  So sad to see that a company spent so much effort on this game, and this bad mistake slipped by the art director or QC somewhere.
If this was fixed on my copy, I'd probably give this game an 8.5, but as it is, I give it a 7.

I am not a big fan of train games like Steam. I don’t really know why as I, as a eurogamer, should like everything about them, but they just aren’t that interesting to me. I don’t refuse to play them, but I also wouldn’t actively seek them out and suggest them. This is the case with Steam, and it turned out to be the same with RotW. I’m still undecided about which game I like better as they have different strengths and weaknesses, but RotW is definitely the easier one and probably a bit more forgiving. I liked the different bonus cards and the route bonuses for connecting certain cities as you had some goals to aim for along with your secret objective card. You always have to balance this against moving the cubes in your network and get a decent income, which in this game equals your VP (sort of), which made it easier to understand. I definitely see why some people love these train games, but I prefer other eurogames. I would definitely like to try Age of Steam and Railroad Tycoon, but I cannot see myself playing these games all the time.

(Original Railroad Tycoon): Good fun though some of the design decisions seem poor. The board is simply too big for most tables. The scoring track could easily have been printed on a separate board where the train markers would have been less likely to be knocked by accident. Empty town markers are unnecessarily big and just add to the clutter and the cost. Which side of a river some of the city rail connections are on is also unclear. The colours of the blue cities match the purple cubes so cause confusion. The actions summary could easily have been printed at the top end too, rather than leave huge empty spaces. Apart from that, I like the game a lot.

Incredibly fun, and very strategic.  I try different strategic each time I play, and an unusual approach cost me the game last time.  However, this game has the potential to allow for a varied collection of strategies and plans.  The cards add an excellent twist to the game, and getting control of areas in the NorthEast is, in fact, very important.  The randomness of the cube dispersion at the beginning of the game (we had red cubes in cities in the middle of no where) can get frustrating, but there is enough lee-way in the game's strategic components to be able to work around them.

Overall, an excellent game.  Make sure you have a very large table to play this on.

This is nothing more than a reprint of "Railroad Tycoon" with a built-in expansion additive.  If it looks like a rose and smells like a rose...

The instructions read similar to RRT, and the gameplay is identical.  I like the extra Mexico map, and some of the rules have been tweaked.  I also like the gray trains that replace the black ones.  Other than that, it is the same as its previously-published cousin, and therefore receives the same rating.

This is a good train game.  Once again, too many things to do with too few actions make a winner with fun decisions.

Technically, I played the Western U.S. map, but for one play, I figure I'll rate the base game because I have no comparison.

I love Steam. And consequently, it's easy for me to love this game. Steam gets the nod only because I like the tighter map and occasionally tougher choices. But, I gotta respect the fact that this version is easier to teach. The "each person gets three actions" per turn is simple and effective. Throw in the fun plastic bits and sheer size of the map, and it's a very impressive game to share with people that might appreciate a more approachable version of the RotW/Steam/AoS game design. I own Steam, so I'm set, but I enjoyed this.

Decent game, but it is VERY difficult to come out of a bad start and the game is so long you are made to suffer through it if you are losing. Additionally, it is a little long in game time.

Only one play. Very similar to Age of Steam. There are far more cities so there is not the cut-throat competition of AoS.

They are too similar for me to want to own both though.

This game was a gift from my one and only last X-mas. It is a beautiful game to look at and has a very impressive board and nice bits and pieces. It is nicely balanced with many options. I like the auctioning and having choices of what to do during your turn. I really enjoy railroad games and think this may the best one. The one pit fall maybe the lack of ways to win. After 2 games this year and a few last year there seems to be only one way to win, control the northwest. Every time, thats the player that wins. I will play more and see if this is true and if so, then even if it is the best railroad game it may get shelved for the others with many ways to win....ie Ticket to Ride, Santa Fe Rails and Empire Builder.

Overall Score 8, Appearence 9, Components 9, The Box (storage) 4, Rulebook 8, Ease of Play 8, Mechanics 8, Involvment 7, Replayability 8, Uniqueness 8, Luck 4 v Strategy 6 (The higher the number the more it leans that way.)

This is a great step-up from Ticket to Ride. You still get to build trains--but now you get to define the routes. You also add a pick up and deliver layer, AND some money management as well. There's a lot more going on now and it's much more interesting once TtR starts to get a bit stale. The game is also wonderfully overproduced with the plastic train pieces to mark link ownership, and the train-building-themed empty city markers. By the end of the game the board almost looks like a little model railroad set.

Played once, and it looks like a very good game.  We didn't use the Tycoon or action cards for the first game.  Enjoyable, strategic game that seemed to end suddenly, just as it was getting good.

I still prefer AoS for having fewer luck elements (the Tycoon and play cards can swing the game dramatically, and are not quite balanced, IMO).  Still, for a scaled-down version of AoS, RRT is a fine game.  Some issues with production, and the balance remarks above, prevent me from giving it a '10'.

Excellent take on Age of Steam.  I like this one very much, almost as much as Age of Steam itself.  If I'm not quite in the mood to make my brain hurt as much as Age of Steam, this is a good option.  Not necessarily any less brutal, though, since I've seen players get trashed pretty badly.  But it does seem to require less in the way of mental gymnastics - mostly due to the relaxed nature of the stock game.  Great entry by Eagle.  But yes, my board warps.  Blah.

A very enjoyable experience (5 players) on a rainy Sunday afternoon although it's not perfect. But then, I don't mind standing up from time to time during a long game session! It'll be interesting to try out RRT II (should it ever be released). Probably best with 4-5 players.

RATING: 3
I don't want to be overly harsh to this game because it is based on the Early Railways system and I do think that is has some innovative new ideas but I personally would not want to play it over any of the Early Railways Series and 99% of the Age of Steam maps out there, even with 6 at the table, so my rating has to reflect that...

RRT is ostensibly the slightly less gamey, more accessible reworking of AoS (note numerous articles available here on the Geek that detail the differences). Certain aspects of it are actually *heavier* and more appealing to hardcore gamers (i.e.: all the goods start on the board) but on the balance the economic system is much more forgiving than AoS and the board is absolutely monstrous in comparison.


Things I liked:

- Operations cards: add flavour to the game and give sub-objectives to shoot for.

- Goods all start on the board. The significant random element of AoS is fixed and this provides a new, interesting end game condition.


Things I dislike:

- Operations cards add a significant luck factor to the game. If the route you are already building has its ops cards come up at the right time then you are basically receiving gifted points, which feels wrong in a game with this amount of forward planning.

- The economic system feels like it has some issues. In one sense it is too easy to get into the black in the early game because the engine no longer counts against you in book keeping. In another the late game seems wrong because AoS's income reduction has been replaced by a an outright declining income mechanism (you peak at about 50 points with 25$ a turn in income and then start going down, so by the end of the game you're actually poor which feels completely wrong) which I think might be easier to deal with, but ends up being much less enjoyable.

- Flaccid Auction. Sometimes good cards come up, which makes for a couple of bids. Most of the time the lack of roles and the lack of tight competition means it's a waste of money. This is a huge negative because interesting auctions not only provide more entertainment for me, but they also suck more money out of the game and create higher debt piles.

- The bits: the goods cubes are huge, as are the player markers, as are town covering empty markers...all of which impede the actual gameplay, particularly when paired with the teeny tiles.

- The board: it is beautiful, and it's big, but it's WAY too big for anything but a full size (6 player) game. The board physically is at least 3 times the size of a standard AoS board, and the hexes on that board only perhaps 3/4 the size of the AoS ones which means there is an absolute tonne of space. Some competition is certainly spurred in the east coast by the number of cities present, but there is such a surfeit of stuff on the board at all times that it never felt like there was an actual lack, which is one of the big crushes in AoS. There also were very few situations where you could really put the thumbscrews to someone with a ship, because there were just so many options available.

- The game plays just as long as AoS does, but sacrifices depth along the way. This is a problem for me...I was hoping that given the streamlining that the game would play significantly faster than AoS, but it didn't seem to be the case. I also think that on the balance all the rules changes do make the game easier to pick up and play, but take just as long to explain as AoS's system which means that it *is* easier for newbies to compete in, but *isn't* easier to get them started on...and if I'm going to take the time to teach a new player a train game I would just prefer to cut straight to AoS. Yes, they'll face a harsher learning curve, but the overall payoff (IMO of course) is better at the end of the day.

On the balance: This game is much prettier than AoS, and has more historical flavour, but it is not as deep, is not significantly shorter, if at all, and has a much larger space requirement. If you're a more hardcore gamer I would recommend sticking to AoS. If you want a lighter, more thematic AoS style game with less cut-throat competition then this would be worth looking into with the caveat that due to rules length this will still require "gamers" as opposed to the casual set, as there is still way too much to digest for non-gamers here.

Note that the rating on this has dropped a further point since I played the Rails of Europe expansion, which takes the idea behind this sytem and makes it into a better game. RoE still has some of the things that annoy me about the base game, but it does eliminate a few of them (i.e.: the point swinging route cards are now just on the board and available, the money track is a little tighter, the board is smaller) which makes the game significantly more enjoyable.

FWVLIW, this sounds like a much better basic version of the game system that forms the base of the Early Railways Series / Age of Steam / Railroad Tycoon / Steam / &c. than the original release of Railroad Tycoon. Stripping away the operational cards will both simplify the game and greatly reduce its randomness. I doubt this will be better than the Rails of Europe version of this game system for my tastes, but I'm not the target audience to begin with.

I am still amazed that both of my regular opponents are into this game.

It is growing on me. 

We have been told on a number of occasions the group think about how to play the map that comes in the box.  So far I am glad to say that our games have not proved to be that predictable.

Steam has tweeked my interest, there may be no looking back.  This game is never thought about and sits in its box gathering dust.  This game deserves better but it is not ideal for three players.

RATING: 9
I think I like it better than AoS all things considered, which is really quite shocking since I love AoS.  Railroad Tycoon takes the best parts of AoS and expands them while reducing some of the artificial, abstract game mechanics present that honestly I could live without anyway.  Gone are the privileges, gone is the high degree of competition for roles, and gone is spending most of the game bankrupt.  The result is a game that plays smoother (if not tighter) and is ultimately just more fun to play.  The cards actually work pretty well, giving players short-term goals to work toward and I think the larger board makes for a much more "epic" feel than AoS allowed.  I'm sure the beards-and-bellies crowd will decry this as "dumbed down" AoS, but it just isn't- it's still a competitive, challenging game and adding more theme and more accessibility hasn't hurt the core system at all.  I think the production is excellent, but I still despise the gaudy, baroque artwork Eagle is so keen on and although the three-piece board is impressive it warps like crazy.  All in all, I think it's one of the better games of the year but that's mainly because it's built on one of the better games of the past 10 years.  Ultimately, the game succeeds because it's a hardcore strategy game with enough well-placed accessibility to attract players who might otherwise balk at the stodgy, gamey play of AoS.

Excellent ... for a family game. 

Two of the family-friendly elements in RRT:

You can pick any action you want on all of your turns. It doesn't matter if somebody else is doing it. 

You can take shares whenever you want. 

 - bidding for turn order is the only interesting part, but it's painting with a massively broad brush. 

Steam and Age of Steam are world's better for my tastes, but RRT is a pleasant diversion (ELITIST BASTARD).

One of my favorite train games, [u]very enjoyable[/u] and very thematic! The only game that makes me feel I build a real railroad network! Wonderful components!
It supports many house rules, so it can be played in different ways.
[i]I play it using my own version of the 2 player "middle board game" variant who makes it the best train game for 2 players:
- use only the middle board;
- remove all the cards, no objectives, no Western Link;
- use Minneapolis & Pittsburgh and all the incomplete northern cities but don't use the incomplete southern cities;
- use the score.xls file from BGG to keeping the score;
- no auction, change the players order each new turn;
- costs: open_hex=2k, river=3k, hill=4k - no other rules, no cost for ridges;
- urbanization cost is 5k. Use the two Western Link tiles for the RED (urbanization) color;
- end the game = 12 empty city markers.[/i]
For a smaller number of players I recommend using the [i]Rails of Europe[/i] expansion (with it's cards) for better variety, balance and scalability.

RR Tycoon is a good game.  The declining dollar reward once veeps reach a certain point is interesting.  It may help control a run away winner, and it certainly makes it valuable to avoid going for too many veeps too fast.  Great map, easy to read.  

The large board is a major drawback.  We stood for most of the game in order to get a good view of the board.

RATING: 7
Very nice. After only play, it was hard to get a good feel for the strategy, despite playing Age of Steam many times. I like that it felt fresh.
Things I like more than Age of Steam:
1) Just choose something to do on your turn. Really keeps the game flowing.
2) Take shares whenever you want. Eliminates a really slow period of AoS, and a lot of required number crunching to be sure you're taking as much (and only as much) as you need.
3) Bigger map
4) Cards to keep games from becoming exactly the same, without being totally chaotic.
5) Scoring track with smoother diminishing returns, and no 1-for-1 income from shipped goods, which can create a huge early lead.
Things I don't like as much:
1) I probably won't buy it if only for the obnoxiously large board.
2) Unlikely to have the variety of expansion maps than AoS has.
3) You knid of have to know the cards ahead of time to have a decent strategy. You have to be able to predict certain cards coming out (or at least benefit by doing so), and be able to guess other players' goal cards.
If I didn't already have AoS, I would probably buy RRT, if only because of the "less serious" feel.

[i]Thanks to BGG's braindead versioning system the original Railroad Tycoon game this comment was written for has been superseded by its revised offspring Railways of the World. Even though changes are reportedly not very major, you are advised to keep this in mind when you read this comment: it applies to RT, not to RotW.[/i]

Ah... Railroad Tycoon. Now there's a conundrum. At my local game group, a couple is absolutely addicted to it, and nearly always bring it along. They tend to play with a fixed group (as the game is long-ish), but I was able to sneak in a go recently. I've played Age of Steam a few times, although it has been too long for me to remember the precise details. Learning Tycoon is fairly easy then, although you still need to pick up the crucial details.

I'm really in two minds about this game. First of all, it plays fairly easily and loosely. There is no sense of the game actively disliking you as is the case with Age of Steam. Having too much shares too early is not a good idea as you can easily do without them after the game is 20 - 25% done, yet they still continue to put a drain on your resources. It makes sense to start more slowly to avoid them altogether. Not so in Age of Steam, where there is no avoiding these pesky buggers. Second is that the board is big and roomy. Too big and roomy, in my humble opinion. It is hard for players to actually interfere with one another because there is nearly always a way out of a sticky situation. And by the time you actually need tiles with crossing railroads, people have such large amounts of money that there is no barrier to them building these tiles whatsoever. Try that with Age of Steam, where costs can be prohibitive to the point where the issuing of a new share is warranted, not to mention the far greater screwage factor of blocking someone's railroad before he can complete the link. In my game, the winners stayed predominantly in the east, making brief excursions over the mountains only when they got a profitable card to do so. Finally, there is a significant advantage to starting in the east because all the cities are close together. That means you are up and running fairly quickly without the need for shares. If you start in the west, you have to issue shares in order to finance a few bits of track.

I seriously wonder about the cards. They give the game a more lively and unpredicatble feel, but at the same time ruin any forward planning. A good card turns up just when someone on the other side of the board can use it? Hello winning for him, hello losing for you. It's simply free transportation of goods, and giving you a good reward for being in the lead already. I was doing fairly well with just building track until the very end, when everyone except me got hold of a good bonus card [i]and[/i] managed to fulfill their secret goal. This leaves me with a slightly sour aftertaste: all that playing and the game hinges on cards drawn at random...??

Make no mistake, I liked playing Railroad Tycoon despite its simplifications. It's fun and engaging, easy to get into, and looks very nice. But I seriously doubt whether the lack of clear constraints as found in Age of Steam (although they might be a bit too constraining :-)) would make this a long-term hit with me—and that's the conundrum, because I secretly do want to play again. 

[b]Update[/b] The expansion Rails of Europe removes many little gripes I have with the base game.

Wow!  I played this today for the first time and don't normally rate a game that fast, but I really had a lot of fun.  I suspect that I would probably like a deeper version (Age of Steam I am told) but it worked well with my family who don't play heavy games.  The large board and cool pieces rock.  I did have some board warp, but even that didn't dampen my spirit.

Had to get it before it was gone.  Bought June 2007.  First play December 2007.  First play was four players.  A bit too much down time for my youngest son (6 years old).  

Also, the board warping was very noticeable.  As the game went on, the board became more and more wavy.  

The game itself seemed to be a lot of fun and would have been better if my youngest didn't need so much help figuring out what to do.  My wife had a hard time getting over the fact that you had to go into debt permanently in this game too.  I want to play more of this so I will initially rate this an 8 and see where it goes.

There can be issues with a runaway leader if some players are not paying enough attention to others who are (particularly with achieving goals on the Railroad Operations cards). Even so, there is something undeniably fun about the theme, delivering goods, building track, and managing your debt.

I'm glad I managed to pick this up, even though it's the "international" version (cobbled together from French+English parts, in my case).

Preliminary rating after one play.  Being based on Age of Steam, it would have been tough for this to be a really bad game, but I didn't like it nearly as much as its predecessor.  The components seemed overproduced, and not nearly as playable as those from Age of Steam, although I liked the shares that you hand out.  The board was too big for most tables, and lacked the clean look of AoS.  The game played OK, but if someone suggested a game of Railroad Tycoon, I might decline, or suggest AoS instead.  I only have so much time for long railroad games, and although Railroad Tycoon was fun enough, I'd prefer Age of Steam every time.

Really liked this game.  It's like Ticket to Ride on steroids.  You build links to cities so that you can transport the colored cubes to their like-colored cities.  You score more points the further you send it, but it costs more money to set up the track and upgrade your trains.  If you cannot afford it, you will gain debt (that never goes away) and it'll lower you income throughout the game.  Great game!

Railroad Tycoon (Eagle Games) and now the release Railways of the World is a fantastic railroad shipping game.  The originality lies in the hexagonal design of the map and the random distribution of goods cubes for shipping each game.  I love playing the original game with 5 or 6 players.  The European map (Railways of Europe) is the best map and is great with 3, 4 or 5.  Five players is a tight game on the European map!  The game system is wonderful as players start anywhere on the map they desire.  It is truly open ended competition.  Each player builds their lines from scratch and the cubes deplete over time as shipments are made to various cities of the same color as the cubes.  Additionally, to ship farther and farther, players must spend money to upgrade their locomotives.  The game becomes quite contentious as each player balances potentially borrowing to build out their rail network faster, upgrade their locomotive, and do it in such a way as to "beat other players to the punch".  This game is tremendous fun.  The artwork is amazing as are the game pieces.  The cards add just enough spice to the game and everyone draws a secret objective card at the beginning which sits as a long term goal.  I also own other expansions which are quite fun as well - Railways Through Time, the Western US expansion and Railways of England.  I love this game and most players I know that play this game tend to nominate it for play on a regular occassion - even years later since its debut!!!  Railroad Tycoon/Railways of the World and the various expansions for these great games have made my top 20 list of euro style games of all time.

Takes the proven AoS system, adds chrome (some of which seems to serve only to detract from the main system), and puts it all on a board that fails to fit on some dinner tables.  The empty city markers are too large to be functional, and the card system has significant timing and imbalance issues.  In short, it seems the epitome of Americanization - "bigger is better".  In some respects, it is.  In other respects, it is not.

One of my favourite games. There's something extremely satisfying about building up a large railway network. Having to take bonds for large purchases (or an initial purchase) is an excellent mechanic, and means that your style of economy can be fine-tuned. There is also a lot of strategy around planning for long-term deliveries and stealing cubes from other players. We always find that the end game is relatively tight, and often we don't know who has won until we do the final point total. The Europe expansion is very good too.

My first game was fun and very interesting. The components, however, were disappointing. The boards were warped, the graphics seemed hurriedly placed with no thought to the cut lines on the boards, and the city colors were off. They should have hired somebody at Days of Wonder to oversee production of the components. : /

My rating and my desire to play it again will likely go up if the problems are corrected.

RATING: 7
This game is a lot of fun, and much more accessible than age of steam. Age of steam is a great game, but you really need to work at it in order to appreciate it (probably over multiple games). This one is a great medium weight out of the box... sure there is a greater degree of luck 'swingyness', but nothing that a few house rules couldn't easily dampen if it offends you. Certainly one of my favourite games of 2005, and possibly the top choice. 
Update, over time Age of steam is winning out on this one. Its rating is going up, and RRT is going down (but comments still hold).
Update, trend continues. RRT is a family game, AoS is much more tense and at times, cutthroat.
Update, RRT sold, Age of Steam kept.

Revisit the early days of the Age of Steam as you begin with a locomotive (the venerable John Bull, the first locomotive to run in North America) and a vision (your Tycoon "mission" card). From there, build your budding railroad network into a vast empire. Connect New York to Chicago, earn the most money, develop bigger and faster locomotives and maybe even span North America and build the Transcontinental Railway!
Multiple expansions featuring different maps are available. Railways of the World is the new base game for the system and includes the engine placards, railroad tiles, train tokens, money, bonds, and other items that are needed in almost all the Railways of the World series. A gameboard depicting the eastern half of the United States is included in the base game, as well as a mounted map of Mexico.

RATING: 8

Rating it right now as an 8 for the overall system, but I think the maps matter enough to sway it a point in either direction (9 if on Europe, 7 if playing Eastern U.S., etc). Obviously the maps are player-number dependent, so not much choice if six want to play RotW.

First play - the bits are outstanding, which is to be expected from Eagle Games (RIP). The game play is smooth enough. I would rate higher except that I really couldn't relate to this game well - the theme just did not appeal to me that greatly, and perhaps as a result, I could not wrap my head around the game well enough to formulate a coherent strategy. I would be willing to give it another try, and I do think it would be a nice family game (certainly a step or three up from Monopoly)!

RATING: 6
Clarification: I played this as Railroad Tycoon. 

Fun game with little luck and a lot of strategy.  Better with four or more players, as there is more fighting for points.  Very large board that is severely unbalanced, as well as the various cards.  Building rails across the Appalachians is too expensive, I think.  Some card drafting mechanics as well.  The feeling of not enough opportunities to do all the actions you want in a round.
Lowered my rating, as I notice quite a bit of run-away leader problem.  The secret bonus point cards don't seem to make enough of a difference at the end to change this.

With Steam and AoS, there is no need to ever play this again.

I thought a long time about what to actually rate this as.  I think the fun could vary quite a bit depending on which of the cards come out - there is a huge luck/how well do you know which routes are on the cards factor.  I've heard people complain about this in T2R but it doesn't bother me there, as T2R is a 45 minute game.  In a 2-3 hr game, having a runaway leader because his chosen starting position happened to have several major line cards come up really is frustrating.

That said, the good things about the game are that money is more forgiving than Age of Steam's system, if that bothers you - and since you don't have to compete for actions, you have more flexibility and autonomy - but this can cause a multi-player solitaire effect in the early game with fewer players.

From a pure usability standpoint, the gameboard is too big and the text on the cards too small.  If you've got a bad back, don't play this one because you'll be sitting down and standing up the whole freaking time.

All in all, for me, I prefer Age of Steam as it doesn't have the luck components.  If you don't mind a large amount of luck in your longer games, or want something less brainburning, you might like this one better.

This game is quite a bit longer than I feel is justified for the amount of actual gameplay. I'd much rather play Chicago Express, which offers almost all this one does, but plays in a fraction of the time.

One frustration is that the board is so incredibly large that you can't effectively see what's on the other corner of the board. (And my group isn't at all the sort to stand up and stretch over the board just to figure out what the options are "over there".)

It's a fine game, just not one I'm likely to vote for on game night.

"Welcome to AoS lite..."

Ok, should one compare RT with AoS when trying to evaluate it? They share author, theme, and some mechanics. Yet, they have very different targets.

RT is lavishly overproduced, with a (too much!) oversized  board, and marvelous game components, whereas AoS is rather spartan (though functional) production.
All the gamey tricks of AoS have been axed out, replaced by the random cards (spicing everything up): no cutthroath economy, abundance of resources (both money and place on the board), no special roles, a naive (and somehow unfair) clockwise auction for the right of going first.

Clearly, a possible bridge to heavier middleweight games, designed to attract people to economic/route building /pick up and deliver games.

I'd rather play AoS, because the overall playtime is similar, and too much depth has been sacrified to make it ungamer friendly.

I would however gladly play RT, anytime, with 5 or better 6 players.

RATING: 7
- Gameplay and replayability: 3/4. Building railroad tracks and delivering goods is fun. There is not much thought required, but a light game is nice every now and then.        

- Absence of luck: 2/4. Despite of what I read in multiple reviews before buying this game, I feel that the randomness in this game hinders strategy through the "Service Bounties" cards and the random drawing of new goods when urbanizing a new city. Railways of the World is no luck fest, but I do think that the winner will more often than not be the one that had the luck of the draw on his side. 

- Duration: 3/4. A game takes some 2 hours with 3 players.

- Player range: 4/4. Fun with a wide range of players, even with 2.

- Theme and looks: 4/4. This is where the game really shines. The components are great looking and the theme is strong, plausible and very well integrated. The board could have been somewhat better looking and the resources are represented by cubes, but one shouldn't be too demanding :-)   

- Set up/clean up time: 3/4. Less than 10 minutes.

- Learning curve and documentation: 2/4. The rule book is quite confusing, especially because it is separated into a main part and separate parts for the expansions. Also, one has to write his own reference sheet. I wonder what is so difficult about writing good game documentation really?

- Durability: 3/4. None of the components will easily break.

- Portability: 1/4. You'll need a moving van to transport this huge an heavy box. Also be aware that this game requires plains of table space, even when using the small Mexico board.

- Like: great theme and beautiful components, wide player range, nice game mechanics.

- Dislike: a quite pronounced luck factor.

After one 6 player game I was pleasantly surprised. What I thought might be a slow, monotonous game actually turned out pretty decent.

Even though I was badly beaten in my first game, this one ignited a fever in me to play again.  With 3 games under my belt, I was willing to shell out $60 to make it mine...

Update many, many plays later: Still love the game.  I go through cycles where I can't handle the AP, then start burning for the game.  I've spent more time pondering this game than any other.  When the fever is high, I just can't get enough.  Bumping it up to 9.5.  Can't justify a 10, cuz I do have periods where I'm bearish on this game, but the highs justify a higher rating.

P.S. This is the game that initially led me to BGG.

6-player game; 4 newbies (although I've played Age of Steam before).  It ran very long, over 3 hours, but nobody minded as there was lots going on.  Simple rules; interesting strategies.  I think I prefer the looser economics of this to the super-tight, pain-in-the-brain system in AoS.  There's still enough to it to keep players on their toes.  The special cards added just enough extra scoring to kick up the fun without dominating the basic gameplay.  My only complaints are a handful of extremely annoying component issues (blue and black cities are nearly indistinguishable; the scoring track uses a ridiculously tiny and hard-to-read font).

Fun, easy and relatively short at about 3 hours. Beautiful map. Probably a good intro game for players before moving to more advanced 18xx games.

My view on this game has been marred by a very bad first game experience and for most of the game I just wanted it to end. Atleast in monopoly when you are the first to get out you can go off and do something else, I had to sit through the rest of this game making pointless moves and with 6 players it was a slow and painful experience.

RATING: 9
Railroad Tycoon is a streamlined version of [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/metasearch.php?searchtype=game&search=age+of+steam&B1=Go]Age of Steam[/url], which is already a brilliant game by my current favorite designer, Martin Wallace (Glenn Drover from Eagle Games is also credited in this version). Railroad Tycoon is more approachable and forgiving than AoS and has better components (an "almost-too-huge" hand-drawn map, train-themed buildings, sturdy engine cards, and colored trains.) Railroad Tycoon cards serve as hidden victory point triggers. similar to Ticket to Ride "longest track" cards. Railroad Operations cards are drawn at the end of each turn and these are visible to all players. Players can use one of their actions to draw one of these cards, which provide various benefits ("reach destination x" for victory points or "immediately take two actions", for instance). Sometimes these cards can cause a fairly large imbalance/luck factor. For instance, one of the cards provides the player an extra 20 points (!), whereas others provide only 6 points. It's much deeper than Ticket to Ride, but not as deep as Age of Steam. Thematically, it's better than either game. After several plays, players start to learn where the key areas are on the board and will get in there early, in hopes that the proper cards will turn up and convert to some easy points. This isn't an ideal situation, but it doesn't ruin an otherwise good game. Recommended.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I dislike that this version has lost some of the tension of Age of Steam (bidding for special actions, now able to issue shares any time) and it seems far too easy to get cash-flow positive to an AoS veteran.
On the other hand, I've come to like the goal cards after a few more plays. They add another layer of decision making to the relatively simple "build track - shift cubes".
Other changes (scoring track, loco maintenance, etc) don't bother me much whether they're in or out. They just change the stratgies a bit.

Yes its huge and has pretty bits if that also sways your opinion (doesn't do much for me).

Rating based on one play:

This seems to be a nice game. At least after my first three-player game everyone including me liked it. It seems as if you can really screw up your opponents plans and there seem to be quite a few different winning strategies. Will update my rating after a few more plays.

Pro:
+ A lot of possibilities while the rules are easy.
+ Nice components (except for the board, see cons).
+ You can screw your opponents plans. I always like this. A saboteur-card would be really cool. :)
+ Plays fast, not too much down-time.
+ Like a guy from my gaming-group said: "I know for sure that I won´t win this game but I don´t care. It´s just so much fun to play it."

- Two of the three boards and the Engine-Level cards warp. :-/ This is really annoying. I hope I can fix this problem somehow.

"Enhanced opinion" after five more plays:
Pros: Nothing new here. This game is still fun.
Cons:
- I get the feeling that the starting player has quite a huge advantage if the right cards (Railroad Executive, Hotels,...) are on the table and the other players don´t bid aggressively enough. Still wondering what happens to the player(s) who lose(s) the first bidding duell with a lots of shares in their hands.

[Didn´t change the rating. I have to play a few more games to see if the starting player actually has an advantage that can´t be overcome easily.]

Fun game.  AoS is one of my favorite games.  While RRT is very similar and I'd enjoy playing it again...I prefer AoS.  RRT isn't as tight a system.  The bidding for turn order is weak and really in our game..not that important unless there was a card you really wanted.   It is definitely friendlier in terms of room to build.  Our 4er game had one player basically playing solitaire in the southern US.

As I'm sure everyone has mentioned, the map is freaking huge.  I kind of like the map size though.  If you have table(s) big enough, it lends itself to more of a grand experience.  That said, I don't see myself playing this near as much as AoS because AoS just offers so much more variety in terms of different maps.

Lancashire Rails, Volldampf, Age of Steam, Railroad Tycoon.  On it goes - moving coloured cubes over bits of acquired railway line, earn income points, break the spiral of debt.  This is probably the lightest of the four games, and the easiest to "get ahead" with your cash.  A deck of cards throw a little bit of chaos into the mix, and you can't be eliminated by mismanaging your money.  Good fun, fast to play.  Problems?  Several - the game board is way too big; you have to begin in or around the north east, or you will lose and lose badly; why isn't there any 60 degree curves with the game pitched at this scale (the north east will get totally blocked in a few turns); etc.

The slightly re-invented Railway Tycoon.  It is undeniably a fun game to play and this version has fixed a few of the issues I had with the original version.  The major flaw was the bloated, oversized game board which rendered the game unplayable for us.  This version has at least moved the scoring board off to a separate area, meaning everyone is closer to the action.  Still, you can be an awful long way aways from the action if you carelessly choose your seating position!

The auction is dumb, and the random bits are a little annoying. I really, really hate the cards.

I think I care more about the underlying game than the theme, and Age of Steam is so much better.

I did like this game, but I have the same problems with it that I have with other "heavier" or longer games. The amount of thought, strategy, planning, etc. that I put into the game was not more than I find in an hour long euro - but I have to wait 3 hours to see who wins. Too much downtime while other people think. It gets boring, especially when I'm a fairly quick player. I forgot to claim a card for a good amount of points during the game, and only claimed it later when another player thought he had completed the card. This may have skewed the scoring against this player, which is another thing I hate about games where you have to keep track of so many things. One error and you ruin the game for someone.

RR Tycoon was already my favorite game, and I bought the Rails of Mexico map to basically make it equivalent to RotW. But I'm going to rate RotW higher anyway, because the Mexico map makes it much more fun for 2-3 players without needing to buy an extra map.  Kudos for the extra addition.

RRT Comment:
The game that got me into boardgaming. I love the feeling of building massive rail networks on the huge board, making tough decisions of taking shares vs. growing organically, and the uncertainty in when the game ends.  Only downside is that although she loves the game, my wife doesn't like uber-competitive play, so she refuses to play with 6, and dislikes 5 somewhat, whereas 5 is the sweet spot for me.

I found this one to be a pretty big disappointment after already playing Age of Steam. It took the fantastic mechanics away from Age of Steam and replaced it with empty fluff. The board is unnecessarily large and you can't even tell the purple and blue cities apart. The cards are a free-for-all on the first turn of the game and then appear to be a non-factor the rest of the game. The only time bidding for your turn is of any importance is if a good card turns up. It's probably an OK game, but I don't think I would ever wish to play this again if Age of Steam were also an option.

My wife loves this one, but it's too random for me.  Too many of the cards in the deck hand out random bonuses, and not always to the person who draws the card!

RATING: 6.25
The much-improved version of the Age of Steam rules.  Streamlines a lot of crap out of the game, fixes the income/vp track, adds in some cards for more interest, and has a far more attractive board/components.  Now you have 3 actions a turn, and for each one you choose from a menu of options.  That's it.  You can issue shares any time, and the start player auction (if you play with the later edition rules) is better too.
It's still a fair amount of work to play.  You've got to stare at the map and identify where the good deliveries are going to be, early and late.  Then you've got to take a look at the bonuses and figure out how to get your hands on at least one (that shot of extra income makes a huge difference in getting your business off the ground).  It's way more enjoyable than its predecessors, but still not something I feel like playing all the time.
Naturally, it must be said that the board is huge (table-space-wise) and also too large for a small-player-count game, in which case you should play one of the expansion maps.
Colorblind note: Depending on the edition, map, and lighting, it can be difficult to tell the dark blue and purple cubes/cities apart.

A game with similar rules of AoS, but a completely different feel. More forgiving with more of a choo choo feel. Does not have the replayability of Aos because of the lack of maps.

You've got plenty of room, why not make it big enough to accomodate more than one train at a given score?

I played Railroad Tycoon once. Railroad Tycoon is the better of all the Eagle Games games by a long shot in my opinion.

Which is saying a lot because most of the Eagle Games are garbage in my opinion. I find Railroad Tycoon to be a Age of Steam light. Maybe  the reason why this is a better Eagle Games game is because Martin Wallace has  his input on this game.

Railroad Tycoon is somewhat different than Age of Steam. I say you could own both games. Both games could hit the table for a different game experience for those of you who are a huge fan of train games.

If you want something heavy you'll play Age of Steam. If your a bit tired or don't want to think too much, than Railroad Tycoon can be a nice alternative.

The warp board really sucks. I was thinking that if there were one Eagle Game to have in my collection it would be Railroad Tycoon. Just the fact the board is like that, it's a really a turn off for me and probably won't get it just for that reason.

Those of who likes this game, check into Age of Steam. It's worth your while.

I really find it superior than the other Eagle games I have played. Maybe the fact that Martin had a hand in it affects my judgement a little. I really enjoy Warfrogs games.

I waited to rate RRT until I had played it several times. Each play the game got better.

The several complaints about "luck" in the cards are, IMO, bogus. The auction for turn position and the open-ended variety of choices for building track and moving products more than make up for any luck turn-sequence that benefits a single player. Let's not forget, the player who gets lucky and snags a good card has to burn an action to do so. Quit yer bitchin and respond! DO SOMETHING!

In my most recent play with 4 people I overcame a 25 point defecit to catch the leader (who had gotten great cards) and ended up winning the game by 10 points. Even the other two players had pulled to with 10 points of the early leader.

Game length will vary. RRT can freeze some peopless brains into AP mode. So be it, don't play a game that is known to be 2-4 hours in length if you only like 1 hour games. Carping about length is pointless.

As in all the Eagle Games, RRT is true eye-candy. It looks cool, has a significant heft factor that is deeply satisfying and frankly, the game looks incredible when it's about 70% done... with all the locomotives, tracks and empty city pieces on the board.

RRT vs. AOS

This is AOS light for sure. But it will overshadow AOS in the end. It's very accessable to a wider audience. It's about 2,000% better to look at (go ahead, go look at the front and back cover of AOS and tell me which game has more curb appeal), it's more forgiving and therefore more appealing to a larger player base and frankly, I admire Martin Wallace's ability to refine an already good rules set into a game that, if anything, will bring even more people into the fold.

DISCLAIMER ~ I love train games.

This game feels rather like it was rushed and not playtested enough.  Really fun game underneath but far too long and solitary unless there a ton of people.  Moreover, the auction mechanic seems like a bit of an afterthought.  If a great card doesn't come up in a 3 or 4-player game then most people just pass.  Seems a bit useless.
Moreover, when big contracts appear in the different areas of the board that only one player has developed, it tends to secure their win.  Seems entirely too random for my liking.  And unlike a much simpler abstract train games like Ticket to Ride, where you feel like you've accomplished something, this game ends right when things are just beginning to take off.  
Can't wait to play Age of Steam because I know there is a great game underneath.  This one was a big disappointment...

I'm more satisfied with the play of this rail game than most others, aside from perhaps Stephenson's Rocket.  It's more forgiving, which fits with my play style and who I'm likely to play with.  It's also more about building the railroads versus a lot of corporate management.  This game emphasises a lot more about building a railroad empire rather than a financial one, and that thematic emphasis is what makes it interesting to me.

Age of Steam sounds interesting to me, however I'm more likely to always have someone new to any particular game I play than a table full of veterans and so because of that I prefer games that will allow even a newbie to do a decent job in the first outing.

The size of the board is impressive at first, but one quickly realizes what a pain in the ass it can be to play on.  It's nearly impossible to see the color of the cities from one end of the board to the other often requiring players to stand up to see what's going on.  In addition, the southwest portion is next to useless since it's so costly to build and there are very little cubes to deliver.

Great components - many people have already raved about them. Game play is Euroish - many possible options which makes for tense decision-making. The letdown is in the endgame.

Comments apply to the original "Railroad Tycoon" edition:

Very impressed.  Plays in about 2 hours, which is decent length for a game session, and is easy to learn.  I can see that this would also appeal to non-gamers, and be easy enough to introduce to them.  Using engines to keep track of the score is a little fiddly, but aside from that the components look and work great (as long as you have a table big enough for the massive game board!)  

General rule changes worth adopting from the expansion for all games (as posted [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/527011/the-newest-version-of-railroad-tycoon-and-how-to]here[/url]): 
1. any hex with water costs $3000; 
2. players may [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/92820]choose[/url] 1 of 2 Tycoon cards after the game is set up; 
3. shares can only be taken to get money for immediate use; 
4. blocking is allowed, but players may redirect their last tile (paying the usual cost for that hex, and counting towards the four maximum per turn) - see Keith Blume's post [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/2203326#2203326]here[/url].  
5. [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/307574]Passenger Lines[/url] replaces New Train.  Remove Railroad Executive card that gives an extra turn.
6. Having major lines available to all players from the beginning of the game.  Otherwise it can be somewhat of a lottery if the cards show up in the USA map - perhaps all the major lines should all be revealed at the beginning of the base game with the USA map, as suggested and discussed [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/337154]here[/url].
Many of [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/318095]these variants[/url] are commonly used by experienced RRT players.

Effectively this is Railroad Tycoon with new/better maps, and incorporating the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/445604]rules tweaks[/url] already implemented in the expansions.  Railroad Tycoon, Mark II - my favourite train game series just got better!  Terrific components, lavish production (looks like a miniature railroad!), accessible yet great economic game-play, strong theme, decent playing time, perfect weight game, highly recommended! See my comprehensive pictorial introduction to this series, which trades the development of the Railroad Tycoon system from Age of Steam onwards, reviews the gameplay, and compares the expansions, here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/533330

The randomizing of goods cubes at the start of the game is an excellent mechanic for making every game different.  To make the goods less abstract, we assign them as follows: black = coal, yellow = grain, purple = iron, blue = passengers-mail, red = cattle (lumber is other option that would be true to the time, petroleum/oil was first transported in 1865).  

Comes with two maps: Eastern U.S. and Mexico.  See my pictorial review of the Mexico map (great for 2-4 players): http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/522307 (Note: [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/8164022#8164022]play with all cubes on Mexico map regardless of player numbers[/url])

[thread=1118209][/thread]

The Railroad Tycoon engine just keeps motoring along, and it's great to see this latest incarnation of the game come with further improvements (and with word that there's still more to come).  Overall it's a very good reimplementation, that improves on the original in small and subtle ways, to make a good game even better: improved rules, a new map for less players, tweaked components, and more.  Main changes:
● Additional Mexico map. 
● Smaller US map (and separate income track). 
● Better long term objectives. 
● Improved starting cards.
● Revised and improved rules. 
● Other cosmetic improvements.
With the original and highly popular Railroad Tycoon now out of print, Railways of the World is a solid replacement and all-round improvement, and I hope that more in the boardgaming community will discover what a gem this game really is. For a detailed comparison between Railroad Tycoon and Railways of the World, see my pictorial review: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/526996

Also worth considering: AoS style turn order bidding: "In Railroad Tycoon, the turn order auction has only the winner paying money and going first, with the other players following in clockwise order. In AoS style bidding, players bid for turn order as in the official rules but the resulting turn order is the reverse of the order in which players drop out of the bidding (last man standing goes first). Players who do not bid anything go after all those who do, retaining their turn order relative to each other.  Players who do not bid, and also the first player to drop out after bidding, pay nothing. The last and second-to-last players pay their full bids. Everybody in between pays half their bid, rounded up."  This is a For Sale style bidding system; alternatively you can have all players going free except the top two bidders, since in RRT the difference between going 2rd vs 5th is usually not that important. For more discussion, see [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/315955]here[/url] and [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/289885]here[/url].  
The latest edition includes rules for this as a variant in the rulebook.  These rules are also implemented in Railways Through Time, as discussed [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/642588/questions-about-the-new-rules-for-the-turn-order-a]here[/url].  A Vegas Showdown style bidding also available [filepage=43455]here[/filepage] as recommended and discussed [thread=1002686]here[/thread].

Two player variants on the Eastern US map: games also seem to work fine, there's less interaction perhaps, and you're both building up your own empire, but it's still fun.  Two solutions to create interaction:
a)  [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/100656]the popular 2 player variant using only the middle board segment[/url] (which provides 2 of each color city) - any hexes which are not complete are not playable and are not considered (including Pittsburgh and Atlanta).  Need to playtest to determine if the full number of goods are used, or if the reduced number as usual for 2 players.  
b) Glenn Drover suggests a [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/1242766#1242766]two player variant[/url] where neither player may build west of the mountains until one reaches 60 points, to help solve the problem of imbalance in the north-east.

Rule notes:

[gameid=30450] - European map, has less cities, a smaller but higher quality board, seems to result in a tighter and more balanced game with tougher choices, and a better choice for 2 and 3 player games.  It is optional to reduce cubes in 2/3 player games with the expansion, [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/2569511#2569511]as discussed here[/url], at least with three players.  
[gameid=131386] - Canada map, plus rules for transatlantic game
[gameid=72268] - Travel across different maps, the number used is proportional to the number of players.

Best with 2-3 players: Mexico map (plus Europe & Canada map with reduced cubes); best with 3-4 players: Europe & England & Canada maps; best with 4+ players: Eastern & Western US maps; Railways Through Time works for all player numbers.

[gameid=99692] - random events that apply from turn to turn.

Estimated playing time: allow 30-45 minutes per player if they know what they are doing, 45-75 minutes if they don't.

Reduced cubes for 2/3 player games: do NOT reduce cubes on Mexico, Europe, England, or Time maps.  DO reduce cubes on Canada map (though arguably [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/13169039#13169039]optional[/url]).

The board is just so big. How can anyone resist a board that's so massive? Submit to the board!

RRT is a great game that becomes more interesting and competitive as the number of players increases.  Five or six is the sweet spot, but we enjoy it with any number, even with some of the two player variants.

Balanced growth is key.  The rules are relatively simple so this game is accessible to most newcomers , but it does take a while to really understand the flow of the game.  One also needs a couple of plays to understand the relative value and merits of the Tycoon and operation cards, which can be crucial to winning.  Consequently, the experienced player will almost always win, though newbies usually do well enough to enjoy the game.

Railroad Tycoon can be played friendly or competitively, but in general the competition gets more intense with more players.  With more experienced players, this can be a brutal game.

RRT is a fantastic game and I will never pass on a chance to play.

RATING: 8
Nice blend of route building, pickup and deliver strategy, with all sort of subtleties about beating other players to the goods versus getting for longer deliveries.  Simple rules, not an obvious full strategy.  Plays well with 6 as there is opportunity to play ahead with only occasional ruin.

RATING: 8
Really enjoy playing this game with a full slate of players. A few things about the game bother me though: 1. If you leave only one person in the Northeast, they're usually guaranteed to win. 2. Analysis paralysis can become a big problem when (at least to me) people's choices are fairly obvious. 3. Randomizing player start is key (especially if you always play with the same group). I've played three games with the same group, and the youngest player has gotten a land grant every time right off the bat and won the game (also by heading to the Northeast :) ). This is easy to fix, though.

For some time now, this has been my favorite game to play. I always want to play more. I like the ability to change plans at any time if things aren't working out so well. I like the amount of luck that can provide a little income boost from the operations cards, and that luck doesn't overwhelm the game. The game rewards good planning and long-term strategies but other players can also interfere and upset said plans. I like the balance between wanting to take out more shares to build stuff and just waiting for doing something in the future when you have more income. It's just an excellent game.

I thought and pondered and fretted for months over which train game to get and finally decided on Railways of the World. I cannot speak for Steam, Age of Steam, and all the others, but this game was a huge home run for me. Great strategy, great components, and an aesthetic beauty that appeals to my board game soul. My only complaint is that the designers or publishers could not figure out what the difference was between pink and purple. They are NOT the same color!!

Boy does that blue/purple problem suck, but that's the only problem I had with this wonderful, wonderful game.  It's a pretty fast-paced game because you can do a lot of planning when it's not your turn, and there are lots of interesting decisions.  Lowered rating a bit, haven't played this in a while; it kinda bugs me that misjudging the initial goods setup can hose you for the next three hours.

Fun route creation and goods delivery game.  I feel the game is a step up from Ticket to Ride with the added mechanic in which goods are delivered for victory points. Goods can be delivered using your routes or a combination of your routes and opponents routes allowing opponents to also gain points by your use.

To date, I've only played with two players using the Mexico map and it was really fun. Curious to see what how the Eastern US maps plays with more players.

I hate it.  Yes, it's more forgiving financially but the cards just don't seem to add all that much and, if anything, detract from an otherwise more streamlined game (meaning Age of Steam).  In addition the board is so imbalanced as to make the South and West utterly fruitless.  The crowded NE corridor is just too juicy to ignore, both as an opportunity and a defense target.  I think it will take one more iteration of this game engine to get it right.  Or maybe it was already right in Volldampf!

Outstanding train game with nice components.  Money is VERY tight.  I love the pickup / delivery aspect and bidding for turns.

Does not have good mechanism to prevent runaway leaders.  The goods growth mechanism is also inferior to that of Age of Steam.  In the sense that in AoS, goods growth happens every round and it keeps the game moving, whereas in RRtW, the lack of goods can sometimes be annoying.

A surprisingly good redevelopment of Age of Steam.  It manages to cut out the particular punishing and painful elements of AoS, such as issuing bonds, or matching future goods with cities.  As for the board, I'd rather an appropriately large board than an inappropriately shrunken one (Columbia's Napoleon comes to mind).  Unfortunately, the "high quality" pieces hinder gameplay by obstructing readability.

At long last, I played my first game.  This is far more forgiving than Age of Steam but at the same time a lot more chaotic as well.  The cards can have a wild impact on the game.

I own the original "Railroad Tycoon" version of this game.

Plays a lot faster than I thought it would.  Lots of fun.  Game board is beautiful and HUGE.

We played 3 beginner games without the cards and it was great.  Adding the cards in the game on later plays really changed and even improved the game.

I love how approachable this game is.  Sometimes the choices and options can be overwhelming, but for the most part I find this game is much easier to introduce to new gamers than Age of Steam.

I love having a gut feel for how things will play out and then adjusting to the reality of the situation and cards that come up.  It's especially fun to run the huge 7 and 8 link deliveries.  I like the western link in the Eastern U.S. map as you never know if chicago might explode.  I suggest the turn order variant in the rules and also auction off for the first round as well since that is usually the most valuable time to be first in the turn order.

As a longtime Age of Steam fan, and as someone who has generally been turned off by Eagle Games, I had no real desire to ever try this take on the Age of Steam system.  But I enjoyed it quite a bit more than I was expecting to.  There are still some of Eagle's garish design choices, meaningless components, and a slight non-elegant feel to the game, but overall, I really liked it.  It does away with AoS's auctions, but adds some interesting cards that provide a whole new dimension (and some might say slight chaos) to the experience.  I feel like it simplified the rules and made it more forgiving while still giving each player almost as many decisions to make.  The fact that the "Railways of the World" edition comes with two maps right out of the base game box is a plus too.  Now that my kids have been exposed to this version of the system, I think I'll be playing Age of Steam less, and this more.

Fun, challenging game.  After one play (5 players) we enjoyed the economics of the stock obligations and are still figuring out the best strategies.  Very interesting game.  Because it was our first time and none of us had played before, the game was a little too long, but I think we can do it in 2 hours now that we know the rules.    My board was a bit warped after only one play!  Also we have one player in our group who is partially color blind.  He kept asking "why not just use primary colors?" -the purple/blue cubes and cities were espeically confusing even to the rest of us.

I really like economic games where one has to build an empire, so I was bound to like this one too. It is well balanced and one needs to make some tough decisions during the play. The problem is that the game feels a bit monotonous for me. In my opinion, the influence one has on other players is not enough and the choices one needs to make don't really change as the game progresses. I also really don't like the look of the empty city markers on the board.
Still, I had some plays with this which I really enjoyed. The game is quite long and in the meantime the situation of a company can change a lot. It is fun to observe a railroad network, which seemed to be the strongest in the first half of the game, to slowly fall apart in the second. Although this does not happen too often, but even the possibility of something like this happening speaks for the potential of the game.

RT has a big plus in that it really feels like you are building tracks across the map for the purposes of shipping goods. I love the shares / debt balancing mechanic and the simple turn structure that keeps the game flowing. However, I can't shake how unbalanced the map is. I think it is by design: players are supposed to fight for the most populous areas and then expand out of there. Unfortunately, I find this concept is lost on new players and also severely structures a player's first number of turns - with the outcome being based mostly on best play and luck from the Railroad cards. From an advantageous point, a player seems to be able to expand out and keep a steady lead - unless another player is able to make some pretty good moves, again, based on card luck and precise turns. This is one of the few games I've played which I've enjoyed, but because I see how the play will go, I can't imagine wanting to invest the hours that a solid game of this takes. It has a few really good ideas that I think can be found in other economic games and that play in less time and with a less ridged opening game strategy. Even with the Railways of Europe expansion (where the map is more balanced) I was able to take the upper portion of the map. Nobody fought me for it and I ended up having lots of money early on while the rest of the players struggled to just pay off their debt. I do think they could have gone about it a different way to balance my lead - but the point is it would take another couple of plays to get to this harmonious point and I just think there are better games out there to spend my time with. Ultimately, I don't think this game should be played with less than 4 players, and I don't want to invest the 2.5-3 hours that will take for a game that might create a certain lead halfway in and there doesn't seem to be enough to balance a runaway in that regard. I reserve solid judgement because I haven't played the game enough - but I don't think I'll hang on to it. Might enjoy AoS or Steam as an alternative!

Near-perfect train game that distills the essence of the genre into less than 8 pages of rules that can be explained in 10 minutes, but yields complex play and near-infinite variety (due to random placing of goods cubes).

Not the intense brain burner its older brother (Age of Steam) is, but what it doesn't have in weight it makes up for in accessability.  It's presentation has more chrome, and it's more friendly economically, but there are still some tough, tense decisions to be made.  Although I prefer Age of Steam, this will see more playing time.

UPDATE:  Boy was I wrong.  While this dolled up younger sibling sits on the shelf, its predecessor has found way to the table a lot.  After a few extra playings Tycoon has proven a lesser game.

Just goes to me in sending from the U.S.. This is certainly a serious board game. Even so, is not a "game" and the "GAME". I was a fan of all kinds of computer moguls, and Sid Meyers Railroads in particular, could not ignore it. Well this is a desktop version! :-). Eeh, even to desktop version of Heroes of Might and Magic - and would be eternal pleasure! :-)
In the future, I think, purchased a few additions to it, maps of other continents / countries.

Would be nice to see a game of 20th century seaplane routes, such as the routes from USA to the Pacific and China.  The book "Wings to the Orient" gives a lot of info which is "looking for a game"- the interplay of aircraft design, seaplane base building, selecting hubs, stopvers, and profitable routes during the whole decade of the 1930s-1941.

Fiddly.  Expected to be making more evergreen 'engines' instead of getting lucky with the randomly refilling goods in the cities.  After the hump there wasn't much to do with money and it became a race to ship cubes before the leader exhausted the other cities.  The double sided tiles are real clunky.  Nothing really sexy or intriguing about the game in play.  Maybe I expected too much from a crunchy railroad game, but this didn't deliver to my expectations.

IMHO, the best railroad game out there- granted, I'm not a huge railroad game fan & haven't tried them all. But this is exactly the level that I find suitable for myself, family, and other gamers. The maps are beautiful & make one want to play (unlike the God-awful maps from many other train games). The only drawback is that it is a beast for space, but that does help the theme & epic feel.

Played 6-players with a Western U.S. map with Stock Market expansion and Event cards.  Nice medium weight train network building game.  Stock Market expansion drowned out the train development part of the game so I don't recommend that.  I've heard Western U.S. map is more balanced than Eastern U.S. map and the Great Britain map is best for less than 6 players.  If I thought my family would want to take Ticket to Ride to the next level, this would be the game to get.

Not as punishing as AoS, which is a good thing for my group.  The map is just too big though.  I've knocked this down from a 9 because of the too large board.  This is a problem physically (i.e. it takes up too much space, you have to stretch to read the offered cards) and game-play-wise (too much lebensraum when played with a small number).  I rate this higher than Age of Steam to annoy the purists.

One of my all time favorite games. It doesn't get brought to the table very often, but when it does, it does not disappoint.  Some of the bits are annoying (as well as the board/cube blue/purple issues), but it more than makes up in playability.  I haven't played Age of Steam enough to get in on that argument, but I can see why the debate exists.

I may be generous with the rating here, but I really like this game.  The over-sized map is both a plus and a minus, and there has been some legitimate criticism of the map quality.

The price is a bit steep, but if you have the money or a birthday coming up, I'd put it on your list.  Called "Age of Steam - Light" for a reason

Outstanding game--light enough to be taught to non-geeks but engrossing enough for geeks to enjoy.  If problems with the components were improved things would be even better--it's a shame Eagle is out of business!  I would have snapped up any new maps or expanions to this game they made (obviously picking up Age of Steam is my other option...)

Update August 2007

I still love this game.  My enthusiasm to play this great looking game has not diminished.  I feel bad for the players who didn't get a chance to buy this one at reasonable prices.

Update March 2008

I thought I was interested, but am just not interested in the expansion.  Besides progression into wargaming since, one of the draws of this game for me is its very epicness.  The Europe map does not seem very epic at all.  Just evenly balanced cities all over the map and no tightly preferred spots.  I like asymmetrical starts.

Had to downgrade it just a bit because I have Merchant of Venus, which does a lot of the same things as RRT, but better.

Age of Steam didn't wow me like it wowed others, so I have been curious to try Railroad Tycoon.  I liked Railroad Tycoon, but now I wonder if I miss role selection in AoS.  It's now been a while since I played AoS, but it does seem like Railroad Tycoon is more forgiving.  Even so, If you get behind in either game early on, you are pretty much doomed for the rest of the game, and there really isn't anything one can do to catch up unless you luck out with cards or something.  Or you can spend the time just pecking at other players.  The Eagle production looks to my like an example of aiming high, but with less than stellar results.  You've got a strange mix of nice and shoddy in one giant box.  The watertowers are fun, but the board basically stinks.  It's too big, and even though it is too big, the score track is too small and easy to mess up.  The artwork with the rivers is unclear, the city colors of blue and purple are hard to tell apart, and the board doesn't lie flat.  So, they had great intentions and aimed high, but in doing so had to cheapen component quality and make a game that is in the end is expensive. I do look forward to trying the next generation of this game, though.

Very similar to Age of Steam which I also like very much.  RRT seems to need five players to keep it interesting (unlike AOS.)  It's a little simpler than AOS but has a certain charm to it that makes me want to own both.  8.8 rating is for this game with non-base game board.  With base game board the game gets a 7.5 from me.

Played a three player game.  It was over within an hour...  Trying a 4-6 player game on the weekend.  Four player game with all the rules played longer.  Still hasn't gripped me, and rules are a bit unclear.  Will definitely play again, but need to clarify rules first.  For now 6.5/10.
Played RT some more... I find this falls in a category for me where I'd rather play it than wash the dishes, but I can't really see myself seriously suggesting it.  Something just doesn't grip me.  Perhaps it's the warpy big board, or the oversized empty tokens, or lack of conflict due to the large play area.  The games we have played have been interesting, but I just believe that there are too many other games out there I'd rather play given 2 hours and 5 opponants.  Those games get a 7/10.  This gets a 6.  I want to like it more.  I just can't.  Too much wargamer in me... perhaps if we could blow up each others tracks...
July 4, 2007: Up to 4 plays.  It's an enjoyable game, so I'm putting it up to a "7" for now.  Hmmm...
Feb 2008: Updating my ratings.  RT is a solid 7, but probably won't go higher.  There is a lack of player interaction that takes the edge off.  What it needs is the ability to purchase shares in opponants railway, with final VPs adjusted to shares in other Railways.  Allow take-over bids :) That would push it to an 8.  Must play with 4+ players.

Bought in February 2012. I first played this at a board game club while we were briefly living in San Francisco, and I instantly fell deeply in love.

When I was a kid my parents used to think I loved trains, mainly because I was obsessed with my Brio set. But trains didn't interest me, what I loved was BUILDING TRACK. Trying to use every piece to create a huge fully interconnected network without creating any loops that you could get stuck in. Pushing the trains down the track was merely a mildly pleasant chore - like the second half of a round of [thing=31481][/thing] - to test the quality of the creation.

And this game lets me turn track building into a competition. I LOVE IT!

I find the wonderfully overdone aesthetics of this game irresistible. Yeah, the board is too big to fit on any human-sized table; yeah, the empty city markers are ridiculous, but I LOVE IT.

Good train game, the cards are a bit confusing because they are so many and you must think about them to get an edge.

The bids for going first are mostly useless except if there's a great card in play everyone wants, or if there's a railroad you really have to do before anyone else.

The board is monstrous so you may be unable to play it due to space issues alone.

It ends a bit prematurely.

The weakness of RRT is mainly the bidding system, which I think is both unfair (being second for free isn’t bad at all) and uninteresting (compared to AoS where you bid for different action that impact the game more). This game isn't as tight as Age of Steam, where the maps are usually smaller and it is easier to take the goods, but I generally think there is enough of it.

As I said, there are things I like with this game though. It doesn't feel as convoluted and mechanical as Age of Steam and the game looks more pleasing to the eye.

As impressing as the board is to look at, it has some problems. Not the size itself, but the usability problem that the crucial cards in the game is too far away from the players on the other side of the board.

I recommend playing this with at least four players, preferably with 5 or 6.

I really liked this one after the first play.  There are lots of very interesting decision points, some of which are driven by opponent action/reaction and others by your adopted strategy.  Reasonable pace after we figured out how things work.  Nice components.  HUGE board is an understatement and it does have some warping...but we can fix that up.

After a few plays, this one is a solid "9" and could go up to "10" soon.  Yep, it did...

Just a fantastic game. Players build a network of railways in order to deliver goods for points and income. The game naturally progresses through more complex systems without ever feeling heavy. Long term planning must be balanced with short term gains, and money is usually tight. I love the components and bright, clean artwork. The included Railways of Mexico plays very well with two.

I now have all three of the above mentioned games and I think this is my favourite.

A good game, but very similar to Age of steam.  A little more forgiving  and, not quite as tense.  I like the addition of the cards, they brake up the standard play, and add a little variety from game to game.  We played with 6 and the board size seems just about right, with less I could see it being too big however.

Update the board is too big for less then 6 players.  Western Link is worthless.  Punishes building long links.  Age of Steam lite.

A high level of player interaction and number of tactical decisions create an enjoyable experience.  It's exciting to see how your rail empire grows after starting with nothing.  I prefer the expansion boards to the base US board, especially Great Britain.  Finally, the components are simply outstanding.

This was a big hit with our game group, we all like train games and this is complex enough to be interesting while easy enough to quickly get into a game even on the first playing.  I also view this game fondly since I won a copy here on the Geek, big thanks to Eagle Games.

Not as hardcore as Age of Steam, and for me and my play group this is a good thing.  A nail-biting game with experienced players, not overly long.  Slightly marred by production issues, but these do not detract from the game play, which is excellent.

Surpassed by Rails of Europe.

Good game based on business. The most ruthless and daring will probably be the winner, unless the wise and intelligent made good moves in the game.

Both intelligent and ruthless players can get their fun out of this game. 

You can play intelligently by planning everything, even the occasional blocking of your competitors... or push your luck just in case the other players either do not see what you are attempting to do or you're just an opportunist and use the moment when the other players are building things to make your daring move!

Quite fun.

I like the design of this "connect and deliver" system overall. My issue with this original implementation of the series is the predictability of the bonus routes, leading folks to play in certain areas in anticipation of the known routes showing up. So, I created a table system for randomizing the route origin and destinations. It is still triggered by the cards, but the cards are not predetermined routes.

RATING: 8
Railroad Tycoon is, in my opinion, the best effort from Eagle games to date.  This is largely due to the fact that the system has been adapted from Martin Wallace’s stellar Age of Steam.  The changes are, for the most part, acceptable, and some are even quite good.  The result is a game that is often tense, and forces players to make important decisions throughout its duration.  While dominating the northeast can lead to victory, several players should be competing in this profitable area, making that strategy less likely to succeed with experienced players.  The result is that there are numerous strategies to pursue, and no one sure path to victory.

Is the game as good as Age of Steam?  That will certainly depend upon who you ask, and perhaps what you are seeking.  Experienced gamers will likely prefer the purity and tightness of Age of Steam, while folks who enjoy games with a bit more randomness and freedom may well find Railroad Tycoon more palatable.  Both are quite good, though, and should please the majority of folks.

got in a 6 player game over xmas break 2006 - game took about 3 hours of play time.  i enjoyed it all the way through, though i did start looking at my watch towards the end...but i always do that when a game starts taking too long...too many games to play and so little time.  i managed to make it all the way to the last turn only issuing 2 shares of stock, though i never made a delivery over 3 links and started to fall behind.  much more forgiving than age of steam money-wise.  over-produced you say?  what's wrong with that?  i like the enormous board.  i'll have to buy a new table if i bought this one though.

Sencillo, divertido y relativamente corto, mucho mas azaroso y menos exigente que sus hermanos Steam. RotW sirve de trampolín a los juegos de trenes, el azar de los eventos y las cartas de operaciones puede hacer que los jugadores con menos posibilidades no se queden atrás.
A mi me parece un juego muy divertido y mucho mas agradable que el sesudo y exigente Age of Steam.

My only train-game. If you like big boards, this is your game! A nice game in a heavy, big box.

The gameplay is pretty easy, it´s all about connections and delivery.

The downside are the cards, or lets say the cards-system, as this is all about luck and those cards have a pretty big influence in this game. I never played without them, but I will do next time.

Many years later... still a solid delivery game which is fun, but the card-system is still a pain. Sure you can bid more to be the starting player (= getting the card you want), but since this game is a "rich gets richer" style game, it will be more easy for the player  to get the card, who is already in front of the others.

Overall, a very good game with some implementation problems.  Its very simple for how deep the game is, and that is its strength.  It also rewards effective long term planning.  The problems are in the map design, the implementation of the secondary mechanics, and the resulting balance issues.  Certain areas must be fought over or you give someone the game.  In other areas, if you leave someone alone, you give them the game.  I prefer just looking out for how I can win and screwing other players because I want to - not because I have to do it to keep the game from going off the rails (excuse the pun).  Spending part of the game chasing down what other people are doing and worrying about whether we let someone do too much - not fun.  The cards are obnoxious (both tycoon and railroad operations).  I'd like to give it another play sometime, but I'm not too excited about it.  I really wanted to like this, but I just don't think train games are my thing.  Martin Wallace is also not really my thing.  I like the idea of this game, I don't think its bad, I can recognize the good things about the design and its appeal, but I just didn't have that much fun with it.  I've had a similar experience with other Martin Wallace games.  I should probably give it a second chance.

RATING: 10
This game is easy to learn - rulebook is 4-5 pages.  This is a solid step up from gateway games (for instance Ticket to Ride, Airlines Europe), but still a game that new players will understand very quickly with some guidance. Every turn there are so many options and you have to balance short term gain with long term strategy. This requires planning, but also you will have to predict what the other players are up to. Timing is essential, and being able to control the triggering of game end is often the deciding factor in tight games. 

The Mexico map is excellent for 2 players, although I would suggest to skip the turn order auction in the 2 player game. The Eastern US map is somewhat unbalanced, but is probably best with 5 or 6 players. The England and Wales, as well as the Europe map is excellent for 3-4 players. 

Railways of the World has almost an epic feeling with the large maps and the wonderful high quality components. The huge boards look fantastic as tracks, trains and empty city markers are starting to appear. The US cross-continental rules will be released in the summer of 2013, making it possible to combine the Eastern ann Western US map. 

After a few plays, you will start to understand the possible strategies. After all,this is not a very deep, complicated game. With the right gaming group, you will feel the challene and tension in every game, and the game somehow seems to provide more fun and excitement than some other train games (e.g. Steam, Age of Steam).  

The random distribution of cubes during set-up contributes to every game playing out differently.Highly recommended for casual gamers who are seeking new challenges and more serious gamers. I enjoy train games a lot, everything from this one to the 18x family games

[Initial Impression: 8]
Comparisions with its "parent" game, Age of Steam, are inevitable, but the two games are really geared toward different audiences - those who find Age of Steam too harsh, haven't played it, or are willing to set aside the comparision will be delighted by the scope, theme, and playability of this game.  There are some issues with the production, all highly discussed in the forums, but none sufficient to diminish the game experience.  Perhaps the only one that really affects gameplay regards which side of a river some city exits are on. The auction for player order is a bit odd, since it is generally better for the person on your right to win than for you to win (unless there is a very important operation card available). You don't need to worry about issuing too many shares, as using them to get a large engine can be rapidly made up for by long deliveries.  The operation cards add a bit of spice (or a bit of mayhem, depending upon your view), but knowing the card effects in advance allows them to be incorporated into your plans, making them almost predictable (and never surprising).  The large map can allow players to not interfere with one another if they wish, but the major lines will still usually see competition.  I really enjoy the heavy (some say enjoyably punishing) feel of Age of Steam, but find Railroad Tycoon to be more accessible, intuitive, and thematic in a shorter playing time.

I had a number of old comments, but I changed my rating to a 10 now.  The scoring system is simple and elegant and ties in well with money.  The debt management is tense at first, and player order auctioning can be very crucial to a certain card.  Running the numbers of profitability are important, but later on the plan changes to pushing more points.  It's an interesting dynamic.  Having the goods randomized each game means there will be different opportunities, so despite playing the same map, there can be a lot of different nuances to the way things play out.

It plays great with 2 players on the Mexico map, which is a boon for playing only with my partner.  It's light enough for anyone to understand, but intricate enough to have a lot of strategy and options each turn.  I keep looking forward to playing this more, and for the foreseeable future, this will be a 10.

RATING: 6.5
After on solo play, and comparing to both Steam and AoS, I have to say I like this the least of the three.

Less a gamer's game, more a family game, with lovely bits and a big pretty look.

Still has the same very random good growth of AoS (I like Steams' control better), and what's worse the Shares pit doesn't take you cleanly out of the game, but leaves you peddling madly in air, unable to fall to your immediate doom, and stuck taking shares all the way to the end of the game (one player ended up with 49 shares, but still had a positive victory point total in the end).

I think the bigger board decreases some of the competition (with 4 tycoons), and the random fall of cards can hurt you if your bidding options are not the best they come out.

But all said, not a bad game, just not as great as it's older and younger siblings. A 6.5 to start (1 solo play).

Great, epic game of railroad building!  It compares favorably with Age of Steam, and has some similar mechanisms.  I liked the historical data and variations added by the tycoon cards.  

This game has the feel of building railroads, along with the complexity of balancing stock issues with income.  I like the variability and complexity.

On the down side, as has been mentioned, the board is quite large and a little difficult to keep flat.  It is a game that does not hit the table too often, mostly because it is so intimidating visually.  Also, It is a little frustrating to not have the whole USA on the map.  Maybe a future printing will have a complete USA map version?

I find that my game group plays Ticket to Ride much more often, because it is more accessible to families with younger members.  Ahh me!

Comment for [b]Railroad Tycoon[/b] (Aug 2008):

This gives the feeling that you are actually building a railroad network. Although there are some standard "openings", the random cube distribution gives each game a different feel. It's fast to play--almost no downtime.

Update: this may not be a good 'gateway' game. It is easy to learn, and fast and fun to play. However, the newbie will be overwhelmed and lost as to what to do, as he/she will not appreciate the strategies and tactics (which require several playings to understand). If playing with experienced players, the newbie will be devastated in terms of scoring, and possibly demoralized to the point he/she hates boardgaming in general. It's best to play with players of roughly equal experience or at least familiar with some boardgaming. A neophyte may get the wrong impression. Rating: "10".

Update: introduced this to a new gaming couple on a Game Day, after we had suffered through 4 hrs of BSG. They had played Trans-America prior to that thinking that was too simple, but after playing RRT, they loved it! Just the right complexity level, so I guess it depends on the new player.

Update (09/06/09) after 22 plays: After playing Steam and Age of Steam, I've decided I like RRT the best, and Steam in second place. I want to burn my copy of AOS. I've also played Chicago Express and 1870 (and another 18xx game), and prefer them over AOS also, with Chicago Express somewhat more preferable to Steam.

AOS feels like programming a spreadsheet. The visual appeal of AOS is severely lacking when compared to RRT, or even Steam. At least Steam has two different "flavors"--basic and standard. I like the basic version better, while Standard is just the same as AOS--a big, painful experience. Haven't tried Standard yet, but don't want to bother subjecting myself to that kind of torture again. So, there is an element of randomness in RRT, but life is chaos, isn't it? You need to be able to react to some of the random, but somewhat predictable nature of the cards. Cosmic Encounter is way too random. RRT's "randomness" is just right.

Update (08/06/10): After playing a bunch of Empire Builder crayon-rail games, Chicago Express, a smattering of some Winsome train games, and a touch of 18XX for an extended period, this was a nostalgic homecoming experience. Because the board is fixed, there are 'standard openings' and  strategies, unlike the huge variability offered by Empire Builder and its siblings. Chicago Express and 18XX are more of an economic game, as they don't give the feeling of running a train--they actually feel like running a company. Empire Builder, et al. are more solitary, racing around the board completing contracts, and interaction/conflict is minimal. RRT is somewhere in between of running a train, and developing a network, without the complex economics introduced by a stock market mechanism.

Update (01/04/2014) 37 plays: It has been awhile since we've played this. However, 3-player is not recommended. The board is too big, and there is not enough constraints or tension. The north-east should not be left alone to a single player--duh. However, this leaves the third player to run wild elsewhere. RRT is best with five or six. The game is starting to wane with me and others in my group, since people complain that it is too long with six. With three, this is a "7".

Comment for [b]Railways of the World[/b] (Nov 2012):

Component-wise and rules-wise, not much different from RRT, with several changes:
1) Board is a touch smaller.
2) Slight modifications on map--New York has 3 exits, instead of 2. New Orleans to Mobile is 4 hexes instead of 5 hexes.
3) Score track on separate board. Minor quibble where score track has "switchbacks", where it zig-zags. Very faint arrows show how one track leads into the next, but this is very easy to overlook and screw up the scoring.
4) Operation cards have been tweaked. All major routes are now available on a first-come, first-scored basis, instead of waiting for a card to show up. The 4-speed train is now replaced with a "deliver and collect four different goods cubes for 4 VP" card.
5) Building track in water now costs $3000. In RRT, the cost to [i]cross[/i] a river was an additional $1000, on top of the $2000 for building in a plains hex.

Printing quality has somewhat improved, but it is still hard to distinguish the blue and purple cities. Whether playing RRT or RWotW, both editions rate a '10'.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is essentially the same as RRT, with a number of exceptions:
1) The map is significantly smaller, so it is playable on a 4 ft diameter round table! RRT requires at least a 5 ft table or a longer, rectangular table. This is huge.
2) The map is a one-piece foldout.
3) There are a number of changes to the map:
3a) New Orleans to Mobile is now 3 hexes instead of 5.
3b) New York now has 4 exits instead of three.
3c) Mountains are delineated by a white dot.
3d) The Ozark Mountains are now present.
3e) The blue cities are still blue, but the purple cities are now pink/fuchsia.
4) The score track has its own board now.
5) No more river crossing; rivers are now considered water hexes at $3,000.
6) Some cleaned up rules with bonds issuing (formerly called stocks).
7) Some Railroad Tycoon cards have slightly different objectives. You also can choose between two at the beginning of the game.
8) The plastic train pieces are a matt finish plastic--blue is now horrific sky blue. Black is now gray. Yellow is now mustard colored. Purple is now pink. Ugh.
9) The black start player wooden train has been replaced by a card.
10) The goods cubes are smaller. The colors don't necessarily match with the city colors, however.
11) The four-train public objective card has been replaced with the four-kinds-of-goods "passenger" card, similar to Railways of Europe.
12) Rule for making all major-lines objectives available is optional.
13) Comes with a 2-4 player Mexico board.

The only serious issue I have with this version is the score board: it is not functional or intuitive. Our first game was ruined when the scoring trains were incorrectly placed when moving to the second track. This meant there was a $6,000 jump from $18,000 to $24,000 in income. Only later did we notice that the scoring snaked back and forth like switchbacks. The direction arrows were in white, faded, and easy to overlook. A better solution would have been to go around in a circle, like in Railways of Europe.

The lack of color coordination between trains, cities, and cubes issue continues to boggle the mind.

Also, it is ridiculous that they would be so cheap as to revert to a start player card instead of a wooden token. It is easy to get it mixed up with the operation cards and bond certificates.

I would seriously consider getting this game, just so I could play RRT on my existing table, but I'm considering getting a 5 ft table in the near future, so this is redundant. The quality is a touch better than RRT, in terms of card stock feel, but the color coordination issues means there's still room for improvement.

Provisional rating after a single 5p game sans cards.  Very nifty—honestly can't wait to get this to the table again!  Hope to update soon.

RATING: 9
After a single play (sans cards) of [i]Railroad Tycoon[/i], I was hooked.  A great medium-weight train game that looks fantastic and plays fast with low rules-overhead.

After 6 plays of [i]Railways[/i] (5x 2p (no cards), 1x 4p (with cards), all on the Mexico map):

The cards (Barons & Operations) add flavor and chaos into the mix.  With the cards you have a highly thematic family (or casual) game that's still meaty at the core; without the cards the game becomes a tighter, more vicious mathematical pissing contest, akin to [i]There Will Be Blood[/i] the boardgame, with plenty of forehead-vein-popping "I drink [i]your[/i] milkshake" moments.

I have no experience with the parent game ([gameid=4098]) beyond looking at pictures on the Internet and recoiling at how ugly it is—of course, this means it's a Very Serious Game, since everyone knows the ugliest games are the most rigorous and stern.  I like my math to be fun, so, yeah, it was the pretty bits that finally pulled me in... but the gameplay is solid.

[floatleft][imageid=1453104 small][/floatleft]
Painting the "Empty City" markers really kicks the visual presentation over the top and makes the game feel like playing with a tiny model train set.  Much like the satisfying diorama you're left with at the end of [thing=31260][/thing]*, the board is beautiful after a frenzied game of financial ruination and axe handle hobo-beatings.

Excelent rail game. the best in theme / components terms. #Edit (01/MAR/2008): Played my second 6-player game and came last. Hence the spiteful downgrading. The game is superb. I'm an idiot playing. Still haven't figured out how to get money without issuing tons of shares. Duh!

Gyönyörű kivitelű játék, egyszerű szabályokkal. Mégis sokat kell gondolkodni rajta. Van anyag a dobozban, egyik legnehezebb játékom (mármint súlyra). A tábla hatalmas, nagy asztal kell hozzá, ráadásul ezt szinte csak állva lehet játszani, különben nem férsz hozzá a tábla különböző részére. Az eleje nehezen indul be, mert minden részvényünkért 5.000 dollárt kapunk, de közben minden körben 1.000 dollárt kell kifizetnünk utána. Az elején így nagyon kevés pénzünk van, a játék később indul be, akkor már simán kifizetjük a leépítési költségeket.

I'm a sucker for train games and this is lots of fun.  The board is massive and really creates a fantastic feel.  The components are top notch.

I really do prefer Age of Steam, but sometimes this is the one that hits the table because the group just isn't into the heavier experience of AoS.  This is a fun and exciting game which suits me just fine and scratches a similar itch.  Plus, any game with my hometown (Charleston, SC) as a "big deal" city gets bonus points from me.  EDIT 05/2008:  Now that Rails of Europe has been released, I would really only prefer to play this with the full complement of six players.  It's excellent with six, but loses some tightness with less.

Start your own railway company to deliver the goods the cities are demanding. It's a fun game in which you begin with no cash at all! Issue bonds to get your trains rolling.

Comes with two maps; the massive Eastern USA map which is great for at least four players, and the much smaller Mexico map which is better for two or three players.

There's something about spotting the deliveries that just doesn't work with my brain.  I find it difficult and annoying to pick them out of the visual clutter, and I end up spending most of the game staring at the board trying to do so.

I love this game. Different enough from Age of Steam to justify having both games. The more forgiving economic stock system and the cards make the game great. 
I would of gave the game a 9 if it was not for the board warping and the blue/violet city coloring problem.

RATING: 8
Very enjoyable - a big table is needed for this one. 

Game provides three types of crossover tracks that are never the ones you need! A potential house rule is to treat a crossover track of any type as viable for any crossing of two links - ie ignore the actual tile detail. 

Game works better when you categorise a western link city as multi-coloured, once the link is created. This makes the western link much more valuable as a delivery point for all players.

Another variation that lenghtens the game but adds greatly to the tactical play is to retain all cubes on the board except those delivered between cities of the same colour.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Age of Steam's glam'd up little sister.  Glossy graphics and plastic trains to replace wooden disks.  Streamlined game play plus a huge board.

While the new rules are easier to understand and reduce the money management aspect of Age of Steam, the bidding for turn order became less important but wasn't eliminated. The colour confusion issues and hints of lack of play testing detract from the overall experience.

RATING: 6
A game that simply screams "Look at me!". It's full of great bits and a finished game is attractive enough to resemble a model railway. Like the prettiest girl at the party, however, it can be a bit vacant underneath. The square metre of board space rules out much interaction even when 6 are playing, and the operations cards throw in enough luck to decide who wins. This isn't valueless, but less excess would have been more gameplay so those who prefer to see elegance in a concept will prefer to game elsewhere.

I really enjoy the resource management aspects of this game. I also think there's some merit to the flexibility of being allowed exactly three actions during your turn, as opposed to the "phase" approach of AoS (which I also enjoy).  Deeper than you'd think for the ridiculous components.


On the other hand, the board is so big that I can't always easily see what's going on, and the cards mostly dilute the fun part.

I really wanted to like this one.  I've played about 6 times, I've figured out some good strats, but I just can't get into it.  It almost seems like the developers had some great ideas but didn't have the time to make them work and released the game anyway.  With so many better choices for railroad games like the entire 18xx series or even Age of Steam, I have to give this one a low rating.  I would be happy never playing this again, even with future expansions, although it is interesting enough that I would not turn down a game if there were no alternatives.

Pero sobre todo, es un juego que gusta a todo el mundo en nuestro grupo y siempre estan dispuestos a echar una partida. Por esto creo que, aunque no es el juego que mas me gusta, es sin lugar a dudas es el mejor juego que tengo.

RATING: 8
The game had terrible production/design values - large board with tons of wasted space, scoring pieces too big for the scoring track (which is on the edge of the board and is constantly knocked), many boards warped, empty city markers were far too big, etc. etc. etc.

However, ignoring the design faults (and the hidden investor cards), you've got a great game of railway shipping that's easy to teach and play.  The game ending is slightly artificial - the game ends when all the goods run out - and players create railroads that then serve no purpose.  However, it's always a pleasure to play, there are enough decisions to make to keep players interested and none of the decisions are overwhelming.

Find a big table, give it a whirl, and you should find a good game emerges - just don't think too hard about the theme.

If you let someone get a monopoly on New York, you deserve to lose the game.

After the first play of this game I had to have a copy. Love the game, but then I always loved Rail Road Tycoon too.

The strategy in the game is deeper than you would think, and trips up many new players at first. You need to think long term, not just a few steps ahead.

Love the fact you don't start with any money so you need to take bonds out that you cannot pay back.

Mellower and themier version of Age of Steam. I like it better.

RATING: 5
Not an /awful/ game, but it lacks the bite of AoS. Being able to issue shares at any time makes a huge difference, and I find the role selection much better than the cards, both due to the randomness of which cards come up, and due to having to spend an action to take one. It is also a pity that seating order can matter so much. Having no knowledge of what cubes will appear when taking the production action makes it a lot weaker than its AoS equivalent.

Unlike AoS, the board is so vast that (apart from racing for certain cards) you are likely to only interact with 1, maybe 2 other players in a 6 player game.

The components are either not great (e.g. the board warp problems, and it is hard to tell from some of the art what type of terrain a hex is meant to be, and in isolation the blue colour could be confused with purple) or ridiculously over-produced (e.g. the plastic "empty hex" markers). The rules are also rather vague.

Owned expansions : Railways of Europe, Railways of North America, Railways of Great Britain, Event Deck.

I really dig sandboxy games and this is a great one that fits its theme well. It really looks good on the table when the game ends, you feel like you built your own railroad empire. This game stands the test of time.

My only negative is that the production could have been a bit better on some aspects: The box is ugly (especially the sides) and the bonds and money feel cheap. I guess it's just because I'm used to better, but these two components make the game feel like it's 20 years older than it is.

Juego ideal de ferrocarriles que ha simplificado mecánicas de otros de su clase. Pocos juegos conozco tan buenos para 6 jugadores. Buenas ideas las de  los magnates de ferrocarriles (misiones secretas), o las emisiones de acciones para conseguir dinero pero restar PV´s. La colocación aleatoria de mercancías y algo de azar con las cartas,le hacen tener una gran rejugabilidad. Apto para recién iniciados.Contras: tablero enorme e infrautilizado. Colores que se confunden. Tablero desequilibrado (la zona NE es la clave para ganar... si te dejan estar solo)

Still not sure about this. Too much interaction without enough restocking, If two people fight over an area or resource bank the third non-involved player will win the game. Age of steam is tougher but better. What is the point of the south? what is the point of the western link? it costs too much and benefits everyone (who is connected to Chicago). Somebody at Eagle games needs to go to the local furniture store to see how big tables are and just maybe they will stop producing these triple board monsters.

While Railroad Tycoon is an enjoyable pick-up and deliver/tile-laying railroad game – one that works quite well with beginner gamers - it is lacking something for me.  Over the course of about five plays, I have found that it really doesn’t have any real strong strategic decisions in it.  You have a limited number of actions to choose from, but choosing a particular action is never a tough decision.  Combine the lack of tough decisions with a map that allows players to stay in their own corner of the world for most of the game and I feel that the game just falls flat.

This game is really one of the best I've played. There is so much strategy, so much interaction. Even when I know I'm going to lose, I still have a blast playing it. I love how much strategizing you have to do to stay ahead, yet there is still a fair bit of room for opportunism. Should you play the long game or go for a short term reward? The bluffing element and territorial aspects keeps it competitive, while the way you populate maps keeps it fresh every time you play. I know this is one of those games that might scare away a non-gamer, but I think everyone should try it at least once. It's really a quite simple game to understand.

Great Game!  Best played with 5 or 6 players, but we play with 2, 3 or 4 and reduce the number of cities used so there is more competition.Game length is longer with more players but the added competition for cities and excitement makes it worth it. 7-26-06: With Eagle Games closing and a reprint by another company uncertain buy it if you find it.

This is a fantatsic game.  The components are phenomenal (with exception to the board) and the gameplay is just strategic enough without the rules clutter and analysis paralysis that is usually involved.  Having more players ups the ante and unlike Conquest of the Empire (a game from the same publisher with shared mechanics), the cards are not entirely too numerous and random.  The scoring track is brilliant as it seems to prevent runaway leader and keep a nice tight end game.  Very solid.

Update:  You really need a full compliment for this game as it doesn't scale well at all.  The cards per turn are also really variable in terms of reward and the secret objectives can range from impossible to way too easy.  I think Age of Steam is the better game when the day is over (with a few tweaks, mind you).

I love the system this game uses and want to play more maps.  We all felt there was some imbalance on the east USA map in certain situations but alas it was still very very fun.  Love the use of stocks and the cut throat nature of cutting people off in certain strategic areas.  We played with an auction for turn order which add that extra little bit to turn up the competitiveness.  

This is a very solid game and I am looking forward to another play.

I really like this game - I love the components, I'm infatuated with how the game looks on the table right after you finish playing. Although I think that it is just a step behind AoS when it comes to how streamlined it is, this game is seeing much more table time than Age of Steam. This is one of the two reasons it's above AoS on my personal list.

RATING: 9.75
This one is a big winner.  My personal favorite "big" game.

The Tycoon Cards, Railroad Operations Cards and the random distribution of the cubes at the beginning of the game add to a very healthy re-playability.

As for the map choices:

- Eastern U.S. (Railroad Tycoon version) - great map to play.  Has color issues with blue / purple cities.  Sweet spot is 3 to 5 players, although the map can be a bit tough to find that 5th good starting location depending on cube distribution.  Map generally plays with players taking on 2 to 12 shares.

- Railways of the Eastern U.S. (Railways of the World version) - the Railways of the World version of the Eastern U.S. map "fixed / improved" a couple of items with the Railroad Tycoon version.  Color issues are "fixed".  Shortening the distance between New Orleans and Mobile make it a much more viable starting location, which enables the game to handle 5 or 6 players better.  The Railways of the World rule mod having the major lines available at game start also is an improvement.

- [gameid=30450] - Terrific map.  Prepare to take more shares to fund building over mountainous terrain - I generally have seen 5 to 12 shares required.  Sweet spot is 3 to 4 players on this map.  

- [gameid=42964] is another terrific expansion.  The increased density of cities and reduced number of mountains makes this expansion play quicker than either the Eastern U.S. or Europe maps.  I see this map as a good 3 to 5 player option.  Without a lot of mountains and shorter distances between cities, think 2 to 8 shares for each player.

- [gameid=72267] - Great alternative to the Eastern U.S. maps if you want to play a "big" map.  The new Western U.S. rules (i.e., spin dials on the cities & refueling stations) are a bit "wonky" - we generally don't use them.  Map appears to play 3 to 5 players comfortably and a 6th player is certainly possible, as there are many viable starting locations (depending on cube distribution).

- [gameid=87627] - Terrific learning map.  Mountainous, so players will be taking shares.  3 players appears to be the sweet spot for the map.  This is the only map I would consider playing with 2.  I think 4 would be too tight.

- Recently purchased [gameid=72268].  The theme is quite odd, but the use of maps scales really well to different numbers of players.  I have not tested it at the extremes, but this may be the one expansion that can handle 2 through 6 players.  Acquisition of shares during play seems to be light for this expansion.  Not that it should surprise anyone, but game play on this map is the most different - lots of room for creative play, less opportunities for blocking lines.

- Received [gameid=131386] via Kickstarter.  It's a very solid map.  One of the counter-intuitive aspects is that it actually appeared to be easier to build North-South on this map than East-West.  Acquisition of shares would seem to be nominally in the 2 to 8 range, but could go higher for special strategies/barons.  It felt like 3 - 4 players were right for this map.  I believe it would be possible, but tough, to find that reasonable 5th starting location.

- We have been able to play the Transcontinental game once . . . it's a big undertaking.  I thought the ruleset worked well.  I felt like there was some strategy to making sure you were on the "fat" (i.e., $25/turn) part of the income track when the Western US map came into play . . . enabled you to have cash to build track right away when the new territory opened up.

RATING: 8
My first Martin Wallace train game.  The more I think on it though, the more I enjoyed the track building and the point-to-point delivery system.  There's definitely that touch of magic here.

I've since picked up the game and even acquired a nice printing of the Unofficial Europe map.  It makes for an enjoyable family game when you drop the auction and only use reasonably balance cards.

Apr 08: Wow, I made it up to 7 playings of this already?  Impressive for such a beast of a game.  Still, the inefficient routes just kill my inner economist.

Rails of Europe Version:

Jun08(1 Play): I usually don't rate expansions, but I view this as an almost completely new game.  It just fixes so much of the RRT glitches.

1. The whole board is used since almost anywhere can be viable.
2. It trims about 30 minutes off the playtime through reduced income and quicker city emptying.
3. It offers an auction track so you can play it with gamers and balance the turn order.
4. The card deck is more balanced; it's missing the stupid double action cards from the original.

All of this adds up to an awesome game.  I really like the network planning and economic efficiency aspects.  The promotion of inefficient "loopy" routes still rubs me wrong on simulation, but I can live with that.  It's also very unforgiving for differences in skill levels.  Newbies just don't stand a chance.

If you at all liked RRT, I think this expansion is worthy.

If you want just one train game, this is the one. I love the epic feel to this game. The board is huge and so is the fun. It doesn't have much to do with the video game, but it doesn't matter the board version is great.

I know a lot of gamers prefer Steam/Age of Steam over this, but for me Railways of the World is an almost perfect medium-weight game.

This game actually inspired me to give Steam a try, and Age of Steam another try, but I just don't find extra fun in the extra brain-burn that those games offer. I am amendable to using the auction system from Steam in RotW, though. 

I have to admit that components are a factor in my love of this game. The blue/purple color problem in Railroad Tycoon and RotW 1st ed. used to bother me -- until I managed to trade for the 2nd ed.

The thing that holds this game back from being a 10 for me is how front-loaded the decisionmaking is. Having the very first turn be the most important in the game (asses the entire board and the cards, now determine what those are worth in the turn order auction) is just not great design. I'm tempted to try some variant where the cards and cubes come out at a gradual pace over the first few turns. 

Oh, also, I was a slow learner in this game. Took me 10+ plays before I finally won a game.

This is a great train game!!! I have played and ran this game about 3 or 4 times and have enjoyed it each time. I like all the components to the game. The board is done very well, except i would like the boards to be able to link up to the other ones exactly so that you can play with all of them together. (Eastern and Western). Plus they need a rule set to link the two together.

Railroad Tycoon is, in essence, a refined version of Age of Stream. Tycoon benefits from a higher standard of physical production and shorter playing time. On the negative side of the equation, the map is too large, the card system could be better and the turn order mechanism has been simplified too much.

RATING: 8.2
Playable with 2, but I would recommend at least 4.  I would like to try it with 5 players next.  Great train game just a notch below its brother Steam.  One complaint:  The turn order auction gives one player the right to act first, but the remaining players act clockwise from the auction winner.  This allows a player who pays nothing to arbitrarily act second.  Therefore, seating arrangement has a big impact on the results of the game.  If you sit left of a player who prefers not to bid on turn order, you are in trouble.  Suggest using a variant similar to the AoS method of bidding for turn order.  Rating with variant: 8.4.  Rating without variant: 8

RATING: 9
An enhanced (or lesser depending on whom you ask) version of Age of Steam.  I like this version much more myself.  It's more forgiving of a bad first turn (which makes or breaks AoS) and I like the cards you can get in it too.  Plus I'm a sucker for Eagle's over-produced games.

initial rating....

I liked this quite a bit, it feels a bit lighter than AOS without taking anything away really (except the steam coming out of your ears!) but still a gamers game. Certainty more approachable and much much more forgiving (especially economically) but this isn't without it's own negatives. The board is WAY TOO BIG for sure and if it warps like people say that is really a game buster. I would of liked to have seen more balance in the map, that is more useful areas to build in than just the east coast, especially north east but it may not be much of a factor, more plays will tell. Another subtraction is the added luck in the cards, especially the route cards. Having a route card come out after the half-way point in the game is just dumb, this just becomes a random bonus for someone that doesn't have to do anything at this point. I will insist on the following change in my next playing; all route cards to be used in the game are to be in the starting line up of cards, then they can be picked and worked towards, much better IMO. Other than that it was a fun engaging game that will probably get more play than AOS.

A railway infrastructure building game where players generate income by connecting cities to meet supply and demand requirements.  This is a straightforward game, that integrates fairly simplistic economic strategy (i.e., how deep in debt should I go to make this connection?) with area control mechanics (i.e., what routes should I build?).  This is a pleasant, uncomplicated game with very nice components.

Really good game.Best for 4-6 players.I always compare it to age of steam as they are so similar.Age of steam is a heavier game but this one has alot going for it as well.This one has a good looking components and would be a good step up for non gamers who like ticket to ride but might not be quite ready for age of steam.Board is very large which may prevent me from introducing to some friends who own smaller tables.I would rate this a bit higher but the eastern US map is not my favorite as I do not like the fact that if someone is left alone in the northeast they will runaway with the game.

This is a production that crosses the line from "lavish" to "stupid".  It just takes up too much damn space, and the dumbing down from Age of Steam doesn't work for me.  I'd rather play Age of Steam or, if I don't have time, Wabash Cannonball.

RATING: 5.5
It's a good game though I much prefer Age of Steam.  I like the map, I like the bits, I like the cards. However I don't like that I have to stand up for most of the game just to see the board, it's too big.  The cards are neat but until you've played a few times you'll need to keep reading what's up there. It just feels overproduced.  Sure the money isn't as tight as in AoS but is that a good thing?  It's certainly not better IMO. AoS is complex, but it's also simpler. What you see is what you get, no mystery card flips or mystery city supplies. You see it all clearly on the board with AoS. Overall, RRT is good just not great.

RATING: 6.5
Kind of fun, kind of draggy. I like the flexibility of strategy and things you can do in a turn compared to AoS, but the board is too open (even played with 6.) I don't mind the cards from a luck standpoint, but they cause AP. End game really drags. I played the California board (with the designer!) as 6-er. I'd like to play this against AI opponents, as it's fun to build but not to wait for others to do so.

Update: played India board and Poland board. Both were too open.  One board I haven't played is the original!  But I haven't heard good things.

Update2: Last two games haven't been as draggy, but there's just not enough battling for space or screwage.

"Railroad Tycoon is Age of Steam for Grandmas. Are you a Grandma?" -- Scott Firestone IV


I'd much rather be playing Age of Steam or 18xx. The biggest flaw in Railroad Tycoon is the auction, which is a bid for who goes first. If you have an aggresive player to your left and timid players to your right, you're screwed.  You'll spend the entire game bidding for either 1st or last in the turn-order, while the aggresive player to your left only has to worry about going 1st or 2nd.

Fantastic, wonderful game. Massive, epic, but simple to play with lots of strategic options persenting themselves at any given time. Scales very well down to 2 players, and provides a refreshingly different game experience with 2 or 3 than it does with 4 or 5. Probably the most addictive game I own, this one gets pulled out very regularly, and goes down well with the Ticket to Ride crowd who are looking for something a bit meatier. 

Shame about the blue / purple printing error, and the badly laid-out rules which make looking up rules queries a pain, but don't let that put you off. This is a great track laying game with fantastic components and well balanced gamplay. 

Highly recommended.

After several plays I've upped this from a 8 to a 9. It's just a great game that is easy to learn, difficult to play well and offers plenty of agonizing choices.

Pos:
The Event cards are very important for the game. Changing objectives often is very interesting.

The game is about establishing routes, and then cashing in on it the rest of the game. When you upgrade your train you can establish longer routes.

The big board is important i avoiding track clustering.


Neg:
Too little player interaction.
Stock concept is a joke. Should be Bonds.

RATING: 9
What I like:
The components are beautiful (it's fun seeing the track spread across the board), the gameplay is tense and well-balanced, and the variable setup makes each game feel very different. Appropriate strategies are non-obvious without being obtuse; it's not easy to find the best move, but I don't feel like I'm floundering aimlessly, either. There might be a bit more luck in the operations cards than suits some people (especially when the major lines are separated from the rest of the deck), but it works well for me and my game group. I haven't played anything else in the Age of Steam family, so this is unlike anything else in my collection and I love it.

What I don't like:
Not very much. Umm, the board is so big that it forces me to stand up a lot to see what's going on? There are a few rules ambiguities, but those have either been neatly cleaned up through the FAQ on BGG or can be easily house ruled as long as the rulings are consistently applied.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
I honestly think this is a terrible game.  The runaway leader problem would be awful in a game that takes an hour or two.  In this monstrosity, it makes the game unbearable for all but one or two of the players.  For three or four hours.  Even if I'm the leader, I would never suggest that this be played.  The ratings here indicate that I am in the minority in my hatred of RR Tycoon.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (August 2012)

Last time I played Railroad Tycoon: The Boardgame (as the game was introduced to me) was years ago. Sadly I don’t remember much about the game.

I remember the components were very well done, perhaps a bit overproduced and I also remember I didn’t like the cards, way too random for me. In general I liked the game until I was introduced to Age of Steam (and Steam). With those games available, there is no reason whatsoever to play Railraod Tycoon: The Boardgame. Both games are superior in all regards but component wise.

If I play the game again, I will come beck to do a proper comment. For now I’m rating it according to my current desire to play it (low).

I've played one game each of the introductory game on the Mexico map and the full game on the Eastern United States map.  For the introduction game money seemed pretty tight and while overall not a terribly difficult game it took me a little while to strike a balance between how many bonds to take out and when to wait and accumulate the cash.  As it was the intro game wasn't to shabby.  Then played a 6 person with the orginal rule set...for me it took a little long for what it was. Granted it was a learning experience for three of the players and the other two of the three weren't exactly experienced at the game.  I'd like to play a 4 person game...I would play it with more but would prefer that more of the people were experienced to keep the time down (the game went over 4 hours).  

Overall not a bad game...again given that the game was a learning expeirence for 50% of the people playing in might not be fair for me to rate it.  Some cons were that it seemed after about 2 and a half hours there was a clear cut winner.  Also some of the colors on the board take a little while to get use too.  The scoring mat could have been designed differently (It's not necessarily intuitive).  The pros still outway the cons in this game though.  The components are wonderful, replayabilty is pretty high in that the goods cubes are randomized as well as the operational cards, and the scheer number of pathes to victory prevents an optimal way to win.  I'll reevaluate the game after a few more plays but for the time being it goes down as a solid game for  me.

 Update: Didn't like this game at 1st play but after repeated plays have to count it as my favorite RR game. It's a different strategy each time out with so many choices. You have to know the card deck so you can formulate a strategy which takes repeated playings. Combining Martin Wallace with Eagle Games is a winner for all gamers. LMAO! They changed the name of the game on the data base! My box still says RAILROAD TYCOON.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I find the mechanics similar Martin Wallace's earlier railroad games but, thankfully, without the brain burning complexity which completely turned me off Age of Steam.  If your group loves AoS, stay away... otherwise, Railroad Tycoon will become THE train game of choice for most groups.

We played a 6 player game in a little over 2 hours, and we were learning the rules as we went along, so I feel that with practiced play, a game should not take more than 90-120 minutes.

I enjoyed the action selection mechanism and the random card draws at the start of each turn.  Even though, like AoS, the game penalized players for doing well (although not to the same extent), I don't think that anyone in the game felt that they were completely out of contention during the entire game... and in the end the high and low scores were separated by only 11 points.

This game clears up most of the problems that I had with Age of Steam... and the components are just [i]icing on the cake[/i].  Unless it's the only game on the table, I doubt that I'll play AoS ever again.

My biggest gripe, if you can call it that, is that if you are familiar with the Railroad Tycoon Computer game and were expecting something similar, you will be very disappointed... it is NOTHING like the PC version of the game.   If more of the elements that made the PC version likeable were added back into the mix, I'd probably rate this even higher.  A solid '8.'

A more complicated train game than Ticket To Ride for those who want a greater challenge. This time, you build rails between cities to move goods back and forth.

Buen juego de trenes del Señor Wallace.

Visualmente es espectacular, pero todo lo que lo hace tan espectacular lo hace un poco incómodo. El tablero es muy bonito, pero es demasiado grande, si a esto se le añade que pueden jugar hasta 6 (con menos de 4 no tiene sentido) y que cada uno de ellos necesita su espacio para poner sus cartas y demás, pues para poder jugar al juego necesitas comprártelo y además ir al IKEA para comprarte la expansión (todas las mesas que encuentres).

Salvo por esto, el juego es muy entretenido y cualquier no jugón podría jugarlo sin problemas, ya que siempre puedes pedir un crédito para no quedarte fuera de la partida.

Well discussed issues with the game is the board warp and the colour choice, which I haven't had any problem with (yet). I'm not really too sold on the board size though, it is just too big and they could easily have made it smaller and more manageable, which would have meant I'd feel more inclined to pull it out. Guess I just have to buy an American-sized dining room table.  ;)

Kudos to Eagle Games' excellent customer service by the way. My copy had one of the hex tile sheets printed incorrectly, but I got new tiles within less than two weeks (shipping from US to UK(!)).

RATING: 7
I like this one better than its progeny, Age of Steam, because it has more flexibility and more player choices, making for a more dynamic game.  The Europe map is a bit more interesting than the US map, because there's less of a huge edge for particular starting locations, although it always depends on how many players and how much competition one faces.

One play down on the Mexico map with 2 players.  Fun game, not amazing so far, but rather enjoyable.  One more play needed before rating.  Hopefully on the big map this time.

Update:   Big map played - still 2 players.  Had a great time.  Love this one!

Love this game, but I don't like the first player turn auction. Seems to be there just to make you issue more stock, which if you could pay it back like the PC game, I would not mind. We play without auction, just take it in turns to be first player, works just fine.

Hmmm ... played 4 times now and am still not sure about this one.  Other than the lovely bits, the game's biggest strength and weakness is the very small amount of luck, which makes for a very tactical game but one also prone to analysis paralysis.  I have found that it can also get quite repetative - build track, deliver, build track, deliver etc etc.  The income track is counter-intuitive, as your income goes down after you reach a certain amount of VPs - this is obviously a catch-up mechanism, but its very heavy-handed.  Board is a bit too big - its hard to find a table where the board fits AND you have enough space for your bits on the side as well.  Chicago Express is probably the better train game - it certainly plays much quicker!

Beautifully produced and designed game, the first real train game I ever played, I loved it!

Rated this a 9 first time I played.  Dropping to an 8 based on eagerness to play again and my memories of the game.  But, must try it again to see what jazzed me so much. (One thing is I hadn't played as many games as I have now, but, also, it was a while ago so memory is foggy).  But I do want to keep 9s and 10s as an upper echelon of only the cream of the crop.  If try to play again: there is a reprint now: railways of the world.

After my first play (summer 08) I rated this a weak seven. 

New comment as of 01/09:

My second play has both boosted and undermined my rating. The second time through, I found this to be a remarkably simple game. You spend money to make money. You do it in cycles of three moves. You issue between 2 and 5 shares of stock, depending on the specifics of your acceleration. The first time it was a bit disorienting, perhaps just the hustle and bustle of learning a new game with a huge, busy map and five players. The second time (months later), it all seemed so straightforward. Stake out some territory, look at the goods distribution in each city (random at the start of the game), and then build track, ship goods, and upgrade trains in a steady rhythm. Every now and then the available bonus cards might be worth pausing your steady advance; often they are not. Each player has a secret objective, and I'm not sure they're appropriately balanced. The game needs more incentives to build in the West, particularly the Southwest. Perhaps Dallas could count as two colors for example. Or perhaps land grants used in the southwest quadrant of the board could cover up to six hexes of track. Perhaps the first player to connect to Dallas could get a free train upgrade (who knows why, historically). These are all options that add balance without the altering the system, but it strikes me that the system itself is too mundane for it to matter much.   

Not a bad game, and one I'll probably play one or two more times. I'm just not sure where the excitement is supposed to be coming from. I should try Rails of Europe for the map. The current map seems enormous with three players... but with four or five it's almost like there are two sets of players participating in separate games until the last turn or two. 

Also, I wish Eagle games had spent extra money making the various wooden cubes shaped like different types of goods, rather than including lame and superfluous plastic pieces to mark empty cities. 

UPDATE: Rails of Europe is such a clear-cut improvement over this that it may obsolete it for me. I'll play one more time, but I think my rating is headed for a 6. There are pretty obvious flaws in this game, and they become even harder to overlook when another edition fixes them. 

Update: I've cooled off on Rails of Europe, which fixes a lot of the problems in RRT. Ultimatley, this game has a bad map, bad secret objectives, dull core gameplay (send colored cubes to cities of the matching color), and dumb plastic pieces that are supposed to increase the theme but have no relevance to the actual gameplay. I'd be much more excited about individualized goods. At least I'd feel like I were delivering something. This is an unpolished, generic, ultimately shallow game with a lot of glaring defects and almost nothing to redeem it.

You got to love the artwork. Very easy to learn, quite difficult to master. When playing with good opponents this ca be a very competiive game. 
There are many different strategies to try, and I like the balance of auction, tile placement and economics.

Some downsides:
My map had a color problem, which was irritating at first. I also was a little disappointed when I realized that all the nice empty city markers were just cosmetic and not used for different purposes.

Still, this is one of the best boardgames I own!

An absolutely fantastic game.  Has all the elements of a great one in my mind: fierce competition for lucrative lines, a good debt simulator, nice cold hard cash, and a HUGE board.  By the end of the game the railways meander across the board and you can almost picture the original railroad developers creating their lines across America.  Definately needs more maps and boards.  A very easy game to learn and everyone I have played this with enjoys it.  Buy it Now!!

Railroad Tycoon enables me to play Wallace's train game system with my girlfriend and family which wouldn't be possible with Age of Steam etc. So it definitely has its justification in my collection although I would prefer any of its predecessors any time with gamers as RRT is more random and lacks the cutthroat gameplay that is the trademark of the other incarnations of the system. Thinking and reading more about it, there are many small nitpicks which will hamper the game with experienced players. Just to name one: the provided map has the weakness that it's unbalanced to a large degree in its focus on the northeast and I wonder if the Western link ever happens at all. The Europe expansion seems to fix these weaknesses and most of the changes can be transferred to RRT as well though.

GIGANTIC boardgame,however, makes difficult to find a suitable table. The game ends too much soon in a 3 player game so you haven't time to fully develope your railroad. Victory conditions must be extended a little. Try Age of Steam instead.

Steam-light. I feel like I should enjoy this more than Steam, but it felt a little too light. Some of the confrontation is lost without auctioning for special actions each turn. However, this game is definitely easier to teach and the fact that it can be played as a two-player game means it will probably get played more than Steam. I just prefer Steam.

This is fun but doesn't really compete with the "heavier" Age of Steam for me. I prefer the nastier financing and player conflict that is in AoS. Even for the pretty bits, the board is too big to keep abreast of everything, and it starts to feel like separate games being played at the same table.

Even though I had only an oral explanation of the rules (and I really do prefer to read them), it was pretty easy to pick up, and (although it was with assistance) I ended up somewhere in the middle. Nice bits and a lot faster moving than I thought it'd be. (Well, we played with six, which probably explains that to some extent.)

Very fun!  The board is huge (like everyone says), though luckily I haven't experienced the warping issue yet.  The colors (like everyone says, again) are also a major confusion.  But the board is very impressive once complete, and the play is engaging and suspenseful the whole way through.  It's impossible to not compare this to Age of Steam.  I think that I probably prefer Age of Steam, mainly because of the increased tension and financial stress.  It's also nice to be able to choose from different boards.

What a great game. I have yet to play Age of Steam but for a long time I wondered whether RRT would be complex enough for me. I found it was certainly deep enough for my liking and did remind me alot of RRT the PC game. For replayability I presume Age of Steam holds reign with it's many maps. Some nice bits, however, the empty city tokens are just ridiculously large. A good game but I'm not sure how I'll feel with multiple plays.

The first impression was - wow, look at the size of the map... Strangely enough, the rules are pretty simple, however the game is quite deep with lot's of strategies. This is my first real railroad building game (Ticket to Ride does not count), and for me even the theme is perfect. So I can not find any drawbacks of this. 9 simply because of the fact, that I didn't play the full version yet.

Pirmasis įspūdis buvo: "Oho, koks didelis žemėlapis!" Bet keisčiausia tai, kad taisyklės yra pakankamai paprastos, o pats žaidimas gana gilus su daugeliu strategijų. Tai pirmasis tikras mano geležinkelio statymo žaidimas (Ticket to Ride nesiskaito), ir man netgi tema tobulai patinka. Taigi, iš tiesų negaliu paminėti nė vieno šio žaidimo trūkumo. 9 tik dėl to, kad pilnos versijos dar neišbandžiau.

My preference for Wallace train games.  It takes all the cool parts of Age of Steam, takes out the parts that can be cool but are fiddly and replaces them with more streamlined mechanics that are also cool, and then adds a few clever twists of its own.  The only downside is that you need to build a new table specifically for holding the board.

RATING: 6
As someone who struggled in his first couple of games of Age of Steam I can appreciate the accessibility and forgiving nature of Railroad Tycoon. It is better for heterogeneous groups with players of varying levels of experience with a game. It is not much fun in any game to think that you have lost in the first half hour of a three hour game and RRT avoids this.

It is also a pleasure playing on such a beautiful board (if you have the space). The problem with the board size is that it is hard to get a sense of the board because it is all so spread out. This affects gameplay. I pay little attention to anything going on over the main mountain ridge because it is so far from my sight. It doesn't matter too much though because there seems to be little interaction between the east and the midwest.

I am also concerned about the pacing of the game. The games I have played so far have both ended just as players have set themselves up for strong turns. Perhaps it is ending too quickly to allow for larger empire strategies to come to fruition.

The only relationship I can see with the computer game is the name and theme. Just about any of the hundreds of board games with trains are equally suited for the license.

Based on 4 plays.  A strong game that suffers in the shadow of its older brother.  As for my opinion on the great RRT vs. AoS debate, I come down on the side of AoS.  RRT has a lot going for it: the modified income table is interesting and the flexibility in actions (build/ship/upgrade/etc.) adds a strategic dimension.  However, AoS wins out with a far superior auction, a tighter economy, no goofy cards, and better components (i.e. a board I can fit on my table).  While I wouldn't mind picking up RRT to play with novices, I would almost always prefer AoS.

The game has a few design flaws, but despite them it's still a lot of fun. The blue and purple tiles don't match their respective cubes.

Despite that this is still one of my current favorites and I'm looking forward to the expansion.

Just played once, 6-player game.  I quite liked it.  I had played Age of Steam for just the second time just the night before.  I think both have their advantages.  RT is more forgiving, and the production values make it a joy to behold.  AoS seems to reward experience, and seemed very daunting my first time to play.  Not sure I need to own either of these, but I'll happily play either - if I'm in the mood for a somewhat longer game.

Now that Eagle Games is OOB, is it true that this game is hard to find/get and that it's price is trending upwards on eBay?  Well, I've got my copy now.  (It was the last copy at my FLGS.)

A good game but not something I would want to play every day.  

That's damning with faint praise, isn't it?  Really, that's not my intention...

Railroad Tycoon is a good game.  The rules are clear and easy to understand.  The mechanics of playing the game are simple but the game play choices are not.  Many possible strategies.  A touch of luck, which I like.  I do like this game, but it is a bit heavier than I prefer.  So, for that reason, this is not a game I'd want to play every day, but I do see myself playing this game again.

Based on our initial learning play, I liked this quite a bit, despite the somewhat chaotic environment of 6 players.  I've played AoS once (Mississippi Steamboats map), and while I see some differences, I haven't made up my mind which I like better yet.  Update:  I've played both twice now, and while my group seems to prefer RRT, I'm leaning toward AoS as my preference.  I like both games, but I seem unable to take advantage of the cards in RRT, and be efficient in my building, whereas I do quite well on efficiency in AoS.

Wow, simply a beautiful game, to look at and play. Strong mechanics and forces players to be very strategic so that other players don't catch on to what move you plan on making.
Fabulous game that is cutthroat and demands good use of economics.
Don't get me wrong, the map is beautiful, but errors in the construction of the hexes and warping is lame. Everything else is great!
Excellent map and bits, not too in depth though it seems, and getting behind is a death sentence when its late in the game and you're unable to create or locate opportunities for massive amounts of points? I haven't played this enough.

RR Tycoon is one of our groups favorite games.  Easy to teach and plays in a very reasonable amount of time.  I would've liked to give this a higher ranking, but with the board warping issues and color mismatches, the QC wasn't up to snuff.  Guess that doesn't take away from the true playability however.

I purchased Railroad Tycoon in January 2006, have played it about 50 times since, and it has become my current favorite non-wargame. It's easy to learn and play, and works best with 5 or 6 players. If everyone at the table knows the game it can be completed within about 3 hours.

RATING: 10
The new and improved edition of Railroad Tycoon. 

A fantastic strategy game that is both challenging and rewarding. It is challenging because, despite simple rules, it requires solid long term planning, contingency planning, investment management, anticipation of opponents actions, adjusting on the fly, opportunism, and sometimes a tiny bit of luck. It is rewarding for these same reasons. Just doing well in this game is quite satisfying regardless of how many times you’ve played or even who wins. 

This is an excellent game and the random distribution of cubes and random selection of cards at the start ensures that every game is different. However it is the selection of expansion maps available, each with their own character and challenges, that really propel this game to infinite replay value and all time favorite.

RATING: 7.5
I like the concept of getting money by taking out loans that cannot ever be repaid, and that hurt you every single turn for the rest of the game.  Immediate agonizing decisions.

The only fix needed is that turn order should be completely bid upon.  It is a massive advantage to be going second after somebody who consistently bids for first.

RATING: 7
A good pickup and deliver rail game that is relatively easy to teach and learn for gamer and non-gamers. It is important to understand the VP/income levels and how best to manage that. The cards can be a little too "lucky" as some are much more powerful than others so I typically play with a variant to help reduce (slightly) the impact. Auction variant can also help with turn order determination.  Rails of Europe is a good 4 person map and has a few other elements that I have brought over to the base map to streamline play.

Simply amazing game. Best adaptation of the train theme and very fun to play. Only negative thing: In most games with the base map the east coast wins - and that even when two players build there. The map is a bit unbalanced (in special when comparing the upper east coast to the great plains in the south west). Beside this - just great. Nearly no downtime between players, cool historical feeling, wonderful playing pieces and a great board! Beware of Rails of Europe: You will never end playing this expansion :) Europe ist more balanced, less power-gaming (i.e. you won´t earn that much money like on the original map and it is more competitive) and looks much better!

RATING: 8
After owning it three years and two days i finally played it.

Rating is marred by a discussion at the end of the game when a player said he thought he would score all points with cities he connected to Chicago (even if it wasn't direct)
Also anothe plaeyer claimed that he would have played chicago himself if he knew what effects the western link had ...

Very questionable because it won't make the difference at all.

Sores:
Kris:64 (nineteen in loansà (so moved as far as 83)
Special card the one who says take the fewest loans
Build across the mountains and could connect Chicago with New york


Karl : 50 (around fourteen in loans)

Build in the south alone and was doing his thing. Perhaps he used to many short connections
Should have build from New york to the bottom but gave up on it on turn two

Gust 43 : (17 in loans or there about) The only player to score points from the railroad baron card

Alain 33 : (around 17 in loans to) build in the north east and despite having the best start was pretty undecisive on what to play next.


Trains all players had level four trains except me who upgrade to a level 7 in the last turn followed by moving a red cubes from chicago to new york and another the other way around.

I think 1830 because of the stock market is superior but this was pretty nasty too.

Best thing probably is the declining income.

Got this for playing with the burrito boy, age 6.  He likes it!  (We play without the cards.)

Update: I'm 0-3 against him; our last game was 14 to 7.  Stupid game!

Update: thanks to the combined intellectual might of the BGG readership, I was finally able to beat the little b@$ @&d.

Update: my regular group likes this too, although playing this game is some hard work!

Update: I got my wife (not really a gamer) to play this too.  She liked it OK, but not as much as Power Grid, because in PG "she can see things better," or has a better idea of what to do.  (It didn't help that the burrito boy stomped us.)  But she said she'd try it again!

I played this after having played Age of Steam. Some call it "Age of Steam Lite", which is correct, in a manner of speaking. It's the same 'engine', if you will, but without any of the tension to keep it interesting. The auction, one of Age of Steam's most interesting features, is now hideously boring because there is rarely any difference in what you can do whether you are first or last to play in any given round. The board is FAR too big to support any real tension, and there are certain areas that are virtually worthless.
Plus, an overproduced game should be a feast for your eyes. Railroad Tycoon just looks gaudy.
I highly doubt I will ever play this game again. A rating of 4 is generous for a game that has been so bastardized, but it is saved a lower space on the scale for being one of Eagle's 'better' games. As though that was saying much. Verdict: [b]4[/b]

[2008.Jan.09] A solid pickup-and-deliver railroad game. Balancing issued stock (with the future negative points associated with holding them) versus the need for immediate capital is an interesting (and good) game mechanic that I have not encountered before playing this game. The overall length of the game is a concern that I have with the game.

This is currently my favorite game.

RRT is fairly light yet it manages to give each player interesting decisions. The game can be confrontational with track placement sometimes being fairly tactical (especially in the North-East). 

The randomization of the goods cubes and the operations cards provide for good replayability as well. This sort of randomization is an element in games I particularly enjoy.

This is the game that made me realize that games dealing with finance can be and are fun! I'd love to play some heavier finance/economics games and of course get in to some more train stuff (AoS and 18xx). 

The weakest part of the game for me is the auction, which sometimes just doesn't seem that important. I wish players who went say 2nd or 3rd would also have to pay (a lesser amount though). As it stands simply being to the left of the highest bidder in a turn is/can be an advantage - you get to go second and you didn't have to pay anything. I suppose that's part of the strategy, eh? Seems a little hollow to me though - particularly when you sit to the left of auction winner but aren't building in the same area at all as he is. Oh well. Still this doesn't really detract much from the game for me.

RATING: 8.5
I like the variable setup. I like the strategic implications you can pick out at the start of the game, but how there is enough interaction and randomness to keep things interesting. I like the big easy to read boards. I like that is a longish game that doesn't have any moments of tiredness - I always want it to go longer when I see the end coming. I like that it allows enough space (between turns, or just mentally) to socialise as well as play.

I don't find the things stripped out of Steam and AoS lose much from the game for me. They are meaner, and I like that, but I also find them less thematically engaged, fiddly, and offering less per time invested. I also don't think they differentiate skill differences as much as the extra overhead justifies.

All things being equal, I'd rather play an 18xx when possible, but when it's not possible, I enjoy playing this.

I can easily see why people enjoy this game.  I'm less enthused about it since I've been a fan of Age of Steam for years before this ever got published.  I love the tension from AoS and the tight financial environment and taxation element of pulling leaders back a bit.  In RR Tycoon, there is a potential runaway leader issue but I do like the card aspects even though it offers a heavier dose of randomness which I don't get from AoS.  The major reason this didn't go well with me is simply that the board is NOT balanced (the northeast is crap).

Update (June2013):  I've now played "Railways of the Eastern U.S." and it's okay.  I really do like the rule change that: your first link of delivery must be your own link.  That's significantly less punishing than the original rule from Age of Steam where anyone can take any goods to any city over any link (even not their own).

Received via trade, I've enjoyed it the scant opportunities I get to play.  Loved the computer game, enjoy the boardgame although I'd love to see more complexity...:-)  This is solid for 5-6 players and is good for a more family friendly game of steam...:-)  If you desire the complexity and angst of tougher decision making, go with Age of Steam.  I prefer Age of Steam, but RRT is okay as long as it moves along at a fair clip.  The huge board and the horrendous scoring track as well as a poorly designed board makes certain strategies appear to be far better than others.  Definitely do not let anyone be up in the northeast without any competition.  I since sold my copy since my brother has the game and my current group would prefer to play AOS (that is, if they even desire to play one of these two games!).

Ez egy könnyen tanulható okos játék HATALMAS játéktáblával. A táblán felül minden játékosnak szüksége van még egy kis helyre, ahol a részvényeit/pénzét/bábujait/kártyalapjait tartja, szóval ez a játék NAGYON helyigényes (pl. a szintén helyigényes Agricolához képest is).

A nagy játéktábla hátránya a helyigényen felül még az is, hogy a játékosok a tábla túlsó végében lévő városokat és pontos útvonalakat nem is látják jól át, sem az éppen "piacon lévő" kártyákat (legalábbis a lapok szövegét messziről biztos nem lehet elolvasni). A játék minimális nyelvismeretet igényel, egyedül az imént említett néhány kártyán van írott szöveg, de azok közül is sokat elég egyszer elolvasni, utána csak a kártyához kapcsolódó városnevet kell nézni, pl. Szállodák, távolsági vasútvonalak két végpontja, stb.

A játék elég intuitív, könnyen megtanulható, viszonylag keveset kell várni a többi játékosra, az újrajátszhatósága sem tűnik rossznak, sőt! A játékidő kb. 2 óra, de elég folyamatosan megy, nem érződik soknak.

Érdemes a játékosoknak a többi játékos játékát is figyelni, az ő céljaikat is figyelembe véve lépni, nekik lehetőleg keresztbe tenni. Okos játéknak érzem, amiben fontos a stratégia, de a taktika is. Apróság, de jó ötlet, hogy minden játékosnak van egy rejtett (csak általa ismert) egyéni célja is, amit ha teljesít, a játék végén plusz pontokat kap (pl. a legkevesebb részvényt kibocsátani, a legtöbb összeköttetést felépíteni a városok között, stb.)

A játékot egy tapasztalt és egy kezdő játékos közül valószínűleg a tapasztalt fogja megnyerni, azaz lehet benne fejlődni, szépen felfedezni, hogy mit hogyan érdemes csinálni, meg lehet tanulni eredményesen játszani.

Having played Age of Steam, it's difficult for me to judge this game without reference to its predecessor.  I feel that RRT is a very fun game that is nearly as good as Age of Steam itself. The secret objective cards and the operations cards both add a significant bit of chaos but also give the players other goals to consider when building.  I find they add somewhat to the game.  I also like the more lenient monetary system (no bankruptcies), the increased emphasis on theme and the superior components (despite the warped boards).  I find the inability to ship a good along someone else's track for the first leg of its journey flattens the tactical choices a bit and I also prefer the role selection mechanism of the original.

Am very surprised by the complexity of the game. It's just like Ticket to Ride, but when money and bonds are involved, everything changes. Lots of deep thinking on where to build your next station, to blocking others from getting to another station, this game truly shines with more than 3 players. Everything is a give or take.

This could have been a good game if they'd supplied it with a better map. Why such a large map? Worst of all, the best place to build is the far north-east of the map. The South West quarter NEVER gets used. What a waste of space! The strategy is very one dimensional: dominate the north east and you'll win. Why didn't they have a double sided map a la Power Grid? With a more evenly spread out map on the reverse side - somewhere like France or Poland or England or Spain? I don't understand why so many Geeks have rated this game so highly?

One play with 3 players. I thought the game ended too quickly. We were playing with rule that says to remove 1 cube in all city (with a minimum of 1) and the game was over in 1h30. Our scroe were 24-22-16 and the biggest engine was Level 3. I understand that most of our delivery were 1 or 2 links long. I guess that if we had made longer deliveries our score would have been higher but it seems to be feasible for a player to force a quick end game.

Update after 2 more plays: Our score when up as soon as we focus on upgrading our engine and make long deliveries. This is a very good game BUT: Tycoon cards are not balanced, Objective cards should always be available (not drawn from deck) ad I'm not sure the other action cards are necessary.

The cards are still more random than I care for, but I like the game quite a bit without the tycoon cards. I still prefer chocolate over vanilla though.

Rating drops from an 8 to a 6 as I've never wanted to play it again since the first two times.

I got a chance to play & didn't have to read the rules. Great game taught to us by Jonas. The rest of the group did not like it as well as I did.  Second time around and it's falling in my ratings.

Only my second 10!  Why?  Because it is a great game that scales very well for 3 to 6 players, though I really enjoy the tightness of the 6 player game.  There is enough going on throughout the game to keep you involved even when it's not your turn.  Overall, the quality is good -- yes the board is BIG, the empty city markers a little over the top, the score track problematic, the black, blue, purple, red color issues.  But, this game gets more plays from my group than any other of the large, complex games.

RATING: 7.75
Pros: I find there are sooo many ways to win this one... and it all seems like choices, the rules don't feel much like restrictions.  Fun bits. Cons: Some imbalance in the Tycoon cards, runaway leaders frequent, but worst of all... if you are in last place in a 5 or 6 player game, your chances of catching-up are nill... so you might play for another 2 hours with no hope of winning.  Starting to loose just a pinch of it's initial appeal, due to the ability to hose one's self so early in the game.

OLD UPDATE:
The more I play RRT, the less I find I want to.  Sucks completely to be stuck in the back end of a field of 6.  Changed rating from a 7.2 to a 6.8 to reflect.

NEW UPDATE:
Have rediscovered this game as a GREAT 2-player game.  I think if you play with 2-4 players, it shines.  Changed my rating back to over 7 as a result.

NEWER NEW UPDATE:
Played it with the European Map, which I printed off BGG.  Worked great.  Decided that I like the game so long as there are 4 or fewer players.  5 or 6 means someone serves as dead-weight for everyone else.

One of the earlier incarnations of the Steam system.  On your turn you get three moves, you can take cards, build track or ship goods.  The money you make goes up and then falls precipitously.  The cards can be very powerful.  The newest edition allows the routes to be available from the start of the game.  The game has a big map of the US and one of Mexico.  I really like the game and the components are very nice.

I probably did not need to order this game because I own Steam, but one of my friends who did own it moved to CA so I had to replace it.  It has the same tile laying and pick up and deliver mechanic as Steam, however it adds cards which you can take on your turn that provides you with temporary advantages.  It also includes really great plastic piece which look great on the board.  

The cards actually make the game a little less family friendly but do add a lot to replayability.  I really like this game and cannot get enough of the train games from Martin Wallace.

simple idea but lots of choices on what to build to deliver where. Since there is an income high of 25,  feels like you really have to keep your investment to a minimum early to build up any capital. Cards conspire to shoot up income.

Better than I thought it would be. You have to watch your money carefully but don't be too conservative. The gameplay is good I got something of a sense of running a railroad company but the board has some issues. Blue/Purple are nearly indistinguishable from each other and the markers for an empty town are just way too large covering up the citys exits and name.

VERY well-regarded game. Reimplements Railroad Tycoon and all things seem to suggest that this will surpass its predecessor in terms of rank on BGG.

See Tom Vasel's comparison to Steam:
http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/451866/video-review-age-of-steam-vs-steam-vs-railways-o

Steam takes up less space and the basic game doesn't have auctions (which is something that he prefers).

Ender's review makes a compelling argument for getting this. See: 
http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/533330/a-comprehensive-pictorial-overview-the-quintessent

The game plays in about 2hrs. This could be fun, but not necessarily the best use for a classroom game.

Comment on Railroad Tycoon by Eagle Games:

I like the gameplay, but the physical design is weird, to say the least. 

What's with the giant-can't-fit-on-a-table board? And couldn't they have spared some of it by erasing the useless edge-areas?
Why are those markers for empty towns way oversize (and why are there three different ones?)
Why aren't there proper pointmarkers, that doesn't struggle for space with the others?
Why is the board not drawn up, so that there is never a question on whether a space is a river or not?

RATING: 7
Lousy chinese board quality. All other game pieces are top (but plastic). Empty city markers are beautiful but not practical for gameplay. They are far too big. All plastic pieces can't satisfy me. This game makes me want the classic wooden peaces back. Gameplay is intense and most of the time you have to make cruel decisions. There might be a runaway leader if others fall back too far behind. The long playing time (30 minutes per person) and the monstrous board is a big disadvantage. Is there anybody who ever built the Western Link at a profit?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a revised edition of Railroad Tycoon, and the revisions are all improvements. The colours of the cubes better match the spaces on the game board, and although colour-blind players are still pretty much screwed, at least now normal-sighted people can tell the colours apart.

The most significant change is in the rules; all of the major routes are available from the beginning of the game, so that players can plan accordingly without gambling on a lucky card draw.

I think this is a great game. The maps feel genuinely big, which is not the case in Steam (which is a somewhat deeper game). Even a last-place player will feel he has accomplished something.

The components are all of a decent quality, but (and I'm revealing some bias here) you can tell it's not a product of one of the classier European publishers. The artwork is functional, but you'd never describe it as pretty or elegant. Train buffs and 18xxers won't mind this a bit though, but of course, for them, there's far more advanced stuff out there.

Nevertheless, this is great stuff, and I'd love to get it to the table more often.

Playing this to me is just wasting time that could be used to play a 18xx game instead. It's ok but nothing more. A big minus is that you need a monster of a table for it.

It lacks tension for such a long (and somewhat random) game.
It's more forgiving than AoS, but suffering from a rich-get-richer problem. The auction is pretty bland and the low luck in the production phase has been replaced by the high luck in the cards.
Bits are more beautiful than functional.
I definiteyl prefer AoS or 18AL in the genre.

I am surprised that I really love this game! It's a bit more 'cluttered' than Steam, which was my first heavier train game, but it has a higher 'fun factor' for most of the people we play with. My only complaint with the game is the train pieces. They are the same as Age of Steam and harder to see than the disks from Steam. I'll likely be replacing the trains with disks. We own all of the expansions for this, and I can say that "Time" and "North America" aren't as good as the others.

RATING: 5
A huge board. That is the most important thing to remember about this game. For the rest it's ok, but not great. It takes too long for what it is, and because of the huge board, you are tempted to focus only on the part where you are operating, ignoring the other players that are operating on the other end of the board. 

The importance of the randomly opened (green dot) cards is a bit too high. Once you are behind, its almost impossible to catch up. For a game that last for more than 2 hours, that can be pretty annoying for the person that gets behind.

This game is decided during the first few moves. If you make a mistake there, you can forget it.

Minus: 3 (duration) - 5 - 6 - 8 (unbalanced cards too important, once you get behind, there is no turning back) - [-1]

Got to play this at euroquest. 
The game is a light version of Age of Steam. If you know that game you can pick up on this one very quickly.

I have a few concerns about this game.

first is the size, its huge! I mean, "some people don't have tables this big" huge.  This size is a problem in that you can't really see whats happenig over on the otherside of the board without moving over there. 

The game play has a bit more luck in it than AOS, but not too much. There are cards that can be selected that may give a few points but a good rail system will win in the end. 

I must admit that the Graphic are nice, however I was very disappointed in the quality of the game and some choices in the board layout. This was a suprise for me since thats usually the only thing Eagle does well. The card stock was rather thin for all of the cards except the tain level cards, and this should be kept on a chart. While the board didnt has as much wasted space as some older Eagle game ther was still more than needed. The score track was tiny and could not be read from the other side of the board; and the trains markers do not fit on there. (colored disks like AoS uses would be better)  The train level cards could have been done better and easier with a chart kept on the board.

The biggest gripe however is with the quality of the board itself. I watched out gameboard warp itself from not so flat to almost scroll like as the game progressed. It became impossible to lay track over a gap by the end of the game. This is very poor and something I have not seen with Eagle games before. I hope Eagle adresses this issue. 

I had purchased a copy at Euro-quest and before we finished out 1st game (with a friends copy) I sold the game to another player.

Although some common features, it is very different with AOS. It FEELS not so tense because there is no worry about going bankrupcy... but it IS  not so loose. It's pretty easy to fall behind, if you don't play well.

Tense auction for special actions(generally for New City and Engine Upgrade) are gone away, you can do it with money. So financial management is more important, and more strategic choices are available.

If this is more forgiving, it is because there is no elimination, not because it is easy to win.

[b]11/20/2005 Rating: 8.5[/b] 
Rating from initial playing. This is very cool. Simple rules, lots of strategy, many roads (tracks?) to victory. The money/stock mechanic is brilliant. 

Railroad Tycoon can be taught in just a few minutes and is very straightforward and intuitive to learn. Having the Action summary on the board is nice until you get the hang of what is going on. 

Strategy and tactics are wide and varied as you have so many different areas to work with on your turn. I'm wondering how viable it is to just go off and build up an area on your own as opposed to trying to horn in on areas where otheres are building - looks like I need to play again!

This game LOOKS great all set up. It has a great Euro feel to it with the use of the wooden cubes yet also looks distinctly American with the miniature trains and RR buildings.

I definately want to get this one and play it a bunch to see how much higher my rating will go as well as see what the staying power of it is.

[b]UPDATE 12-26-05 Rating: 9[/b]
Having played this at least 5 times now, I have raised this up to a 9. It may go even higher as time goes by. RRT is a great game with lots of strategy, tactics and - most importantly, FUN. Everyone who has tried this has really enjoyed it and it's been on heavy rotation on our regular Friday game night.

I gave a copy away as a Christmas gift and also got back an enthusiastic response. My copy should be broken in over New Year's... we'll see how it goes.

[b]UPDATE 01-28-06 Rating: 9.5[/b]
Played again last night with 4. Everyone had played many times before and the game was very tense, exciting and fun. The scores were very close (up until the last few rounds). We aren't that cutthroat when playing and I really think playing that way hurts you as much as the other player. We LET someone get the Major Line to Kansas City (with Western Link) and he came in 4th by a wide margin. RRT just keeps getting better and better.

[b]UPDATE 08-14-06 Rating: 10[/b]
This game deserves to be a 10, no questions about it.

[b]UPDATE 08-04-07 Rating: 10[/b]
For me, Railroad Tycoon clearly meets the BBG criteria for a "10" rated game: Outstanding, always want to play and expect this will never change. Played last night and added in my RRT Event Deck - which was the first time my family had ever used them and they went over very well. I'm really looking forward to the "Unofficial Sequel" coming out later this year.

This game is really great.  It has the right amount of startegic planning and interaction and is really good for my gaming group as we have a bunch of people that dislike luck and like more a solitairish game.

Should note my group plays with a number of house rules, including a modified bidding process and major route rule changes (all public, values modified).

Note, due to shear number of plays I am finding myself growing increasingly bored of the game .  After 100+ plays, I think that is expected and is no reflection onm the game itself and therefore the rating is not changing.

Love this game, was scared off a bit by Age of Steam's reputation but this is forgiving enough to enjoy to the end.  My major problem is the size of the board...hoping the new add-on has a smaller board.............It does.

A kinder, gentler cousin to Age of Steam.  More random factors, bonuses, and other things which make it easier to learn.  The bits are really nicely made, although the board folds up the stupid way.

RATING: 9
Rating increased from 9 to 10. I seem to like this game more and more...

It seems to award the courage to invest and the creativety to exploit opportunities.

It's fun to build up a railroad network, upgrade your trains and plan on routing the goods to their destination.

It's also fun to see that new players have an inclination to find the shortest routes for goods to be delivered, where more experienced players are rather looking for the longest (feasible) routes for delivery...

Downgraded to 9 again, since I like Steam better.

My first and only train game. It is light in the rules department, but offers good depth for gamers.  I like to play without the actions cards. This way the gameplay becomes simpler and tighter (with respect to money). My copy came with the Mexico Map, wich I play with my wife. We reduce the number of required empty cities when we want to play a shorter game.

You need a huge table for this!

I like this one and its progenitor, Age of Steam.  I generally prefer Age of Steam because it's tighter, but the increased freedom, reduced pressure and more leisurely pace of Railroad Tycoon are a welcome change-up sometimes.  There's definitely room in my collection for both - they're different enough from each other, and are both well-suited to my gaming group, depending on our mood.  My gaming group generally prefers RRT to AoS, and it gets played a lot more often than AoS.

2-6p, 120m. Age 10 .
Christmas present to myself 2005.
Only played 3 times so far.  A bit worried that it is just a slower-paced game than I prefer and ponder seeking rule tweaks to jumpstart it.  Rules are a bit vague in spots.  Bits are "neat-o" but not without flaws.
The main thing that holds my interest and encourages me to persist is having seen more skillful players win through superior strategies.  I appreciate the non-luck and want to rise to the challenge.
Eventually traded away since I don't have time for 2  hour games any more.

2 plays. Railroad Tycoon version. Fared much better in my second game - in fact winning a 6p!. Originally, I had a problem with the large board and lack of interaction - but actually this isn't really a problem but a feature.  It is kind of nice to carve out your own area of the map but you still need to be concerned when others are doing actions that might effect you.  When they don't do actions that effect you, you can tune it out and focus on your own game.  I liken this game to a large sandbox that you get to play around in.  I have upped my rating by 2 full points.

RATING: 9
Top-notch all around: the components are like Christmas morning; the base game (second edition) includes a great two-player map on top of the enormous Eastern U.S. map; it's easy to learn and easy to teach; and most importantly it's fun to play.

I really dig the bond mechanic; it seems crippling and painful early on, but once you pass the tipping point your bonds are pretty much forgotten, which is fun. I also love the economy of the turns: There's plenty of room for strategy, both long-term and medium-term, and tactics also plays a role -- but with only three actions every turn, you don't have to spend a lot of time taking your turn, or waiting for others to take theirs.

And best of all, Alysia and I both loved it on our first play. What a fantastic game!

There's much to recommend here - a good balance of objective (calculating and spending) and subjective (aggressive play) strategy, multiple demands on your limited moves and a rich theme, albeit one that doesn't appeal to me immensely. Sadly enjoyment of the game is impeded by the board on multiple levels - it's physically too big, there's too much play space and warping on a multi part board like this is damn annoying.

Wanted to like this, but it is so utterly, stupefyingly dull! Feels like it goes on for ages, but without giving you much to actually do. Overproduced, but with a great big hole where fun and interesting mechanics should be. Maybe this is just showing its age, but I just wanted it to end.

Awesome game. Feels like there are are oh so many options on your turn. Seems unbalanced on the first turn.  Most games don't seem to hinge on the very first play but it's next to impossible to catch someone who has been allowed to capitalize on the first move.  Not sure I like that when trying to introduce the game to others.  However, for experienced players, whoa.... great game.

Do you like route-building? Are you ready to step up from Ticket to Ride? This is the game. Instead of set collecting you now have to plan your finances (debt) and build actually functional network of rails to move goods around. Beautiful components. Downside is that it takes 2x as much space as normal boardgame, both in and out of box. Worth it, though. Update: I'm beginning to love this more than Steam, maybe the best traingame? (After TTR of course)

My first foray into the medium-weight railroad games, I do like the pickup-and-deliver mechanic. The game mixes some other of my favourite mechanics: tile placement, network building and card drafting. The auction mechanic was a bit lost on me, only valid if a high-level card was available on the table.

The mismatch between cubes and city colours was a bit annoying, and the scoreboard was a disaster when sitting far away from it. Otherwise, a very fine and intriguing game!

Good train game that isn't bogged down in complexity.  Tile-laying game with a mix of money and resource management.  Nice step up from Ticket to Ride.

That being said, the sheer size of this monster may scare people off. Big does not mean complex.   The Eastern U.S.  board needs a large table.

Caveat, I have not played Age of Steam. This is simply a fantastic game. The economics are forgiving but still reward efficiency. There's plenty of tactics and strategy throughout. Don't let the complaints about Tycoon Cards and Operation cards bother you. The real points are scored through long deliveries, the cards add some nice spice but they're not going to be a kingmaker. I would give this game a 10 but I dock it half a point for the component problems and the relatively uninspired Operations Cards.

Played 5 time.
Last Played Feb 24, 2008

We played it just as a two player to learn it before teaching it to friends.  It was a very interesting game.  I made a lot of stupid mistakes so my husband just bearly beat me.  I imagine it will be a much more cut-throat type of game with more players.

Played it again, this time teaching two friends.  I enjoyed the game up until the end when my husband decided to be a jerk.

The fist two times we had been playing it slightly wrong.  From the directions I thought that each tile was considered a link, so with the 8 train you could only go 8 tiles.  But this didn't seem to make sense as it would be impossible to get any of the red cubes from the second western link to Chicago.  So we scoured the directions until we learned what a link really was.  That made the game play quite a bit differently and was definitly a better game.

One of the first games I bought, and one that makes it to the table frequently. The Eastern US map is pretty poorly balanced with fewer than 4 players but really starts to shine with more players. Buying the Western map is a must if you want to play the game with 3-4 people regularly.

You can mix a variety of players regarding skill level and everyone will have fun, but the game does have a "break point" where the more skilled players will have a better grasp on how to win and it will be a mystery to the newer ones.

Overall, this is a game I'm happy to have in my collection.

RATING: 7.5
Very enjoyable train game. More of a train feeling than Age of Steam with its abstract mechanics and calculations. This is easier, but more correct themewise. Offer stocks when you need the money, just as in the real world. In AoS you're offering stocks when you think you will need some money without knowing yet how much. This weirdness creates all the problems of AoS (too much calculations, very unforgiving etc.). These problems are solved here. 
RT however, has a slight problem of having somewhat solitary play at times when there is nobody around you. It also needs to be played with 6 players always to solve this. Another and more serious problem of the game is that the gameboard offers inequal chances. The northeast wins when someone is there alone. If there two there, then the southeast wins. Too many cubes and bonuscards in that area. Nevertheless, still an enjoyable game.

With so many excellent train games around I chose this one, because it appeals to the widest audience, like kids, adults, spouse and the weird dude who usually stands in the dark corner of the dining room. Lighter on the economic aspect, concentrates mainly on logistic and it has the nicest components; it's the perfect entry level train game in my book. I was late for the party as RRT is OOP now, but fortunately Railways of the World still carries it's purple-blue curse on the glaringly shiny board so I can moan about it too, other than that I'm really happy with it.

I like this game, but I'd still rather play AoS.  This one adds some new ways to score (cards, connections, etc.), but it felt a bit chaotic, at least after 1 play.  It felt like there was a bit more luck than AoS. For instance, a scoring card (e.g. first to deliver to Louisville) could come out in middle of the game that benefits only 1 player.  

I also like the turn-order auction better in AoS and I like the special action selection in AoS.
  
Despite my preference for classic AoS, I still enjoyed this game and would be happy to play again.

Had to buy it. Now I need to buy a bigger table to play it at home.... Great game though.

UPDATE april 09: although I prefer (Age of) Steam to this, when we finally got our bigger gaming table this was THE obvious choice as first game to be played on it...

NL: De grote glimmende broer van Age of Steam van dezelfde maker, "mildere" versie.

Belachelijk groot spelbord (pastte niet op onze oude tafel), maar ziet er goed uit. En het is nog een prima spel ook! Voor iedereen die Ticket to Ride beu is en krijtjes treintjes spelletjes a la Empire Builder/India Rails etc. niet zo spannend vindt.

We played a 4 player game and I really enjoyed the system.  The problem I had with the game was that there was really no competition for going first in the game, building lines, and moving goods.  I would think the game would shine with 6, but with 4 it seemed like you could do what you wanted when you wanted.  Unless I was in the mood to play a friendly game, I would choose Age of Steam every time.  There is a chance this rating could go up with more plays but I have no real need to pull the game out anytime soon.  The over production of the game actually takes away from the game and the board warpage is ridiculous.

As I don't have Age of Steam, I can't compare this game to that.  So I'll go with what I like and I like this game.

My only complaint about it is that it's pretty easy to get into that death spiral.

Pretty fun. Pretty big. I can see myself playing this for a while. I like AOS better, but this is good when you want some eye-candy and a more friendly game.I do not like how there is no "hard-turn" tile like in AOS. This makes the tile placement a little limited and takes away some creativity.

Update: a very good game. It won't get an 8 because of its insane size and sloppy production. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Game in a Nutshell: Lay track from city to city in order to ship goods from cities that have them to cities that want them. Problem is you have no money and crappy trains, so you'll need to decide how much debt you'll want to deal with for the rest of the game.

Played as: 4 player

Pros: This is the perfect blend of economic, tile-laying, and transportation I imagine is possible. The money is simple but heavily considered and not so much in the 'mathy' sort of way but simply as a 'do I need more right now or am I ok?' The open information of the board makes the decisions fair in where to lay their track and is balanced by bidding on who gets to lay down on those sweet spots first.

Cons: It also has one of the biggest downfalls a game could have: It's easy to know who's going to win after 15 minutes if a person gets a good start and from there you only have to play another 2 hours of pointless non-climactic gaming. There's no good way of changing direction mid-stream to adjust to this eather. At less then five players, you eather guarantee this happening or run too good of a chance that it's borderline not worth playing. Furthermore, it's not a game that's going to have a lot of casual 'Cuz, it doesn't make you think as much,' Ticket to Ride gamers waiting to play, because it's really a more gamers game then a social one. So good luck having enough 'gamers' around to make it worth it.

Other: I was really impressed with this game after the first play for all the reasons stated in my 'pros' and really disappointed after the second run for all the listed 'cons.' I really want to consider this one of my favorite games and I still have hope due to there being a chance of more competition with more players. Also, I've yet to play the full compliment of rules with the cards / western link and hopefully that'll bring the game in and make it more interesting as well.

Best Use: A good gamers choice when you like the openness of tile-laying (like me) but want to mix it up with some light economics and trains for a couple hours.

I can't decide whether this is better or worse than Steam or Age of Steam.  Steam, at an abstract aesthetic level, seems to have a better sense of proportion, and to integrate the theme better with a minimum of chrome.  The board is much more compact and functional than RRT's.  Steam relies more heavily on the bidding mechanic, which makes it unfriendly to newcomers.

Railroad tycoon, on the other hand, is more sprawling, and has maybe too many cards, and a couple broken ones.  But you can focus more on building than bidding, which I like. There are late events, like the western link, that make the game livelier at the end, where Steam can wind down early as the cubes disappear.  Also, the cards can lead to some creative play.  

Railroad tycoon works quite well as a two-player game, and for that number I like it much better than the Steam expansions.

Played three times now, and all three games were close and full of decisions. Fun, fun train game. Big, beautiful and simple to learn. Board is slightly warped, unfortunately. The color problem (blue versus purple cities) is not as bad as some say, and our group doesn't have a probelm with it -- but could be better.

I love Age Of Steam, Railroad Tycoon disappointed me greatly. Pretty board, and massive (not table we had could fit it), but it had lost all the interesting stuff. Also, the end does drag on. Due to the size, length and scale of this game, I'll get out AoS instead everytime.

Played once so far; a 'light' train game, it is remarkably true to the PC game, and basically only 3 pp. rules!  Very good at first play; other than a read-through of rules, by myself, with 5 players took just over 2 hours.  Looking forward to the next game!

RATING: 5.5
Surprised that I liked it well enough.  The cards were a pretty good addition.  Some strategy that I could see changing each game, and varying strategies would appear to have opportunities of working.  I thought the hidden extra victory conditions were a little strange: I don't see J. P. Morgan as a secret financier in the background, but only a minor quibble.  It maybe went on a little long for what it was, but still it was enjoyable.  First one of the Eagle line that passed muster with me.  Would play again, and now I am interested in how Age of Steam differs.  Second playing a little too similar to the first, and I sense a catch-up challenge.

I love this game. It looks pretty, is easy to play, and harkens back to a simpler time. I think it would be a 10 if there were more maps available for it. One expansion compared to dozens for Age Of Steam is not acceptable!

RATING: 8
Designed by both Martin Wallace (AoS) and Glenn Drover (AoE3). Players take on the roles of 19th century tycoons and build a network of train track to transport goods to major American cities east of the Mississippi River. Similar to Age of Steam, but this is actually fun to play.

Family-friendly version of AoS -- definitely a lot less cutthroat, with a corresponding decrease in turn angst. I prefer AoS's auction/action system, although I prefer RRT's cube "system". While both are good games, I have to give the edge to AoS. Game gets -.5 points for the insane size of the map, which may or may not fit on your gaming table.

Played once at a game night (Railroad Tycoon version).  I didn't have a "real" train game in my collection (ticket to ride is more of a set collection game, and a good one) so I decided to get this updated version.  A couple of plays under my belt and I think it is a really good game, but the set-up and play time will prevent it from coming out a lot.

I think this one is another hyped one here on the BGG. You can play two games of Volldampf instead of playing one game of RRT and you´ll much more fun. It looks great no doubt about it, but its too long and the map is too complex so you have to look for the best move and that is the main factor for the longer game.

This is my first (and only, as of July 2013) train game. It is also one of the most fun experiences I've had at a convention.

The best train game ! A stripped version of the 18xx series, but the playing time is much more appealing.

A game more about looks than practical game play. The map for example is huge and looks nice but is poorly thought out. An example of this is the spaces provided for keeping track of victory points are to small. Also the poor quality of the mapboard material itself results in it having a tendency to warp. The rules meanwhile are a poor ripoff of Age of Steam. There are much better train games out there than this.

Beautiful plumage, and the changes don't seem to change Age of Steam beyond recognition.  It isn't the streamlined game I hoped for, though - 3 player games look like they will take about 90 minmutes; about the same as AoS.  I'm going to rate this a full point below aoS, since (1) AoS has a better first player bidding mechanism, (2) the event cards increase the luck factor, and (3) the colours on the board have blue/purple purple and pink respectively... these don't even match the colours on the extra cities.  Grrr.

One of our group's favorites for multiplayer, and almost certainly my most played game.  It's simple, plays reasonably fast (2-3 hours), doesn't have much in the way of random elements, doesn't have that pesky feature of not being able to perform an action because someone else took that action for this turn, has no real gang-up possibilities common in multiplayer games, and has numerous expansion maps.  The rules are short, but gameplay requires a good amount of thought/planning to play effectively.  It's deep enough that it requires a lot of concentration, but not so much so that you can't BS in between turns just a little bit. 

We do play with a few simple house rules that bump this game to 'perfect' status.

This game is not too bad...Somewhat based on Martin Wallace's Age of Steam, however Railroad Tycoon is not nearly as punishing.  This makes for a game which could be well enjoyed across the spectrum of gamers...new players to seasoned gamers would probably enjoy.

It's huge! I saw this one at Essen and first thought it was a blown-up demo version, but no, that was the real thing... An entertaining game, pretty smooth version of Age of Steam - once you figure it all out. There are quite a few elements to it, all the cards, and major lines, and whatnot. Also few quite dubious design decisions...

Suggest.

RATING: 6
Great bits, mechanics similar enough to Steam/Age of Steam. I think my early negative experience with it was that Mexico map and my lack of basic understanding of the game mechanics - I basically ended with negative points and felt deeply frustrated. This time however we played on the big Eastern U.S map with all the extra cards, Baron cards, and with the start player auction each round, and the game shifted from terrible to tolerable, and by the end from tolerable to downright decent. I would not necessarily say no to a future game of this, now that I know what I am actually doing.

I like Age of Steam so much, and some of my friends wonder why I'd ever play RT if AoS was around.  I dunno, sometimes you just want something a little different, I guess.  Like the way sometimes I want a bean burrito, and other days I'd rather have a chicken soft taco.  And then from time to time, I get really crazy and order the Enchirito.  I don't know if RT is the Enchirito or the chicken soft taco, but it's definitely not the bean burrito... Mmmmmmm.... burrito.......

UPDATE: I did enjoy this for a while, but it was hard to get to the table since not many tables would hold it.  I love the plastic bits but the cards were a little lucky so when I started playing Steam, which is a more interesting game, and much more compact, I decided to let this one go.

I really like this game but you need heaps of room to play it as the board is sooooo huge!!!!!! You just have to be careful and not let any one player dominate the Eastern Seaboard or they will win the game. Still think some of the Western cities are too hard to connect and their are no incentives to do so. Sop when you play with 5 players some can get really stuck out in the west. Still afun game though best for me with 3 - 4 players.

I like this game better than Age of Steam because of the production values.  Shallow reason, but it's true.  I don't seem to like train games.  It's well designed from what I can tell.  We had fun playing it the few times we cleared out a space for it.

My first "real" rail/train game (excluding TTR, of course).  Nice game, great components and a huge board add up to a lot of fun shipping goods around the Eastern US.  I would rate higher, but I purchased the International Version (what a crock, in other words, a bunch of international bits thrown into a box to sell one last copy in the US), which has Italian on the stock certificates (not that big of deal), the engine upgrades and new city markers (somewhat disturbing) and on the board action list (definately do not like that).  The board quality (or lack of) is consistent with the other posts on BGG.  Otherwise, a great game.  Game Owned: #450.

Another excellent game from Mr Wallace.  It's very tempting to compare with AoS but this is altogether a different game for a different playing environment/group, and in my opinion is in no way less enjoyable.  

The components, accessibility and added tactical dimension offered by the cards make this a game of balance.  Can you take advantage of any quick tactical wins offered by the cards yet still attain the longer term objectives offered by longer shipping routes, your Tycoon objectives and more strategic Operations cards?

For some variety make up Chris Boote's excellent European map and cards variant.

Acquired March 31st, 2008.  

The last bunch of games I bought was in January, so I figured I would treat myself.  I was debating on getting a fewer less expensive games or this.....I chose the latter.  The reason I picked this up is our gaming group recently played Volldampf, which I quite enjoyed.  Yes the price tag of this game is steap, but worth every penny in my book.  I have the internation verision (2nd edition?), which means the engine level cards, the board, and the shares are all written in spanish. (Except on the board it does say Railroad Tycoon in English, as well as all the cities.)  I can live with the spanish, but not the 1st edition's major color problems between blue and purple, but more importantly the board warping issues was a major turn-off.  Plus Eagle games so kindly included player aids in the 2nd edition!
I have not tried or read up on AoS, but this game is very similar to Volldampf, except for the stock/share.  In RRT, you borrow anytime, in Volldampf, you must decide  how much you want to borrow during one of the phases so you can lay your track in a later phase.
In RRT this board is huge!!!  36" x 45"  I feel it takes Volldampf one step further, but actually like Volldampf a bit more.  (Plus one of our gamming members in our group owns Volldampf, so if we want to play it, does not make sence for me to acquire one as well, plus it is a rare game and I wanted something different).  In RRT you need to upgrade your engines, pay for track accordingly to the terrian it crosses, ship goods, build cities, or pick a special action card.
All the components are excellent.
The cubes (goods) which are in different locations every game make each gamming experience unique.  My only downfall(s) of this game would be that even if though the game board is huge, it does get slightly busy because of the tracks being laid and the competion for the NorthEast (which brings debate to if this game is broken).  The scoring track is also on the small side, and will not fit multiple trains.  But please, don't let any of this detract from buying.  These are all minor compaired to how great I feel this game truley is.  Once the game is complete, all the components in their final palce is very visually appealing.

RATING: 8
I really like Railroad Tycoon. It certainly is a notch or three down from Age of Steam in "thinkiness" but that doesn't mean it still doesn't have a lot of interesting decisions each game. Like other classic Euros... there is always that feeling that you'd like to do 3 different things but you can only do one thing at a time so there is always an optimization going on and reevaluating where your actions are best spent. I've only played this 3 player so far and yes there is a LOT of room out there and I can certainly see where it would be better with 4-6 players but I still like the game quite a lot. With more players I'm almost certain my rating would rise as their would be more conflict and more confrontational areas on the gameboard. I found the rules to be rather easy to grok.. there were a few niggly bits in the rules but easy enough to straighten out with the use of faqs and from answers in the rules forum on BGG.

Areas of the game that could use improvement... well I like the big board which others seem to dislike but it would have been nice to have the reverse of the board printed with 2 player or 3 players maps, say 1 board panel for 2 players and 2 board panels for 3 players... just to make a more compact and closed-in area to encourage more confrontation.

Other than that I think the game is solid. If some don't like the Tycoon cards because they think they are unbalancing then chuck them out and don't use them... same goes for the major lines cards... which can be points falling in your lap when they show up after someone has already completed a link. They can likely be chucked as well... or simply select a few and play those face up from the start of the game... everyone then has an equal shot at them all... no surprises.

The auction is a bit screwy and many hate it. I don't think it's a game breaker but it can also be altered as a house rule as well. The game is actually quite adaptable and with user generated maps for more variety there is extra life to the game as well.

I wouldn't say the game is better or worse than Age of Steam... just different. It's certainly easier to get RT on the table with a wider range of gamers than AoS so for that alone it wins points with me. Game time when we first played was something like 90 minutes (probably closer to 2 hours with setup and rules explanations) but I can see this consistently being played in 1.5 hours or so once everyone is familiar with the gameplay. Play length is almost perfect actually as you don't get bored of the gameplay and it leaves you with a feeling of "if only I had a few more rounds to do x and y". A good sign as many games start feeling "samey" near their conclusions.

A solid 8 game for me right now with a good chance at moving up once I play with 4 or 5.

Wow, a neat game. I admit it, I'm a sucker for bits. But I think the game itself is pretty good, too. I haven't played Age of Steam yet, and I'm sure that's a better system, but I'm having lots of fun with this. 

Update: Downgraded the game a couple points. I've played it about 15 times now with (with all numbers of players, but mostly with 5-6) And while I find the basic mechnics good, I'm now starting to get annoyed by a few things: the random card draws (seem to have a huge impact on the game flow), the auction (who you're sitting next to is huge, so huge I've actually considered changing seats in my game), the problem with the southwest part of the map (it never gets used and therefore it might as well not even be there), and the tycoon cards don't seem balanced (particulary if you've drawn one of the doubles that forces you into a competition that the other players don't have to worry about). All in all, I certainly don't think RRT is a bad game, and I have had lots of fun, but I'm just finding it harder to get into it given these issues (All of which seem to be addressed in AoS--which I've finally played--but sadly, my group shows little interest in the original.)

One of my favorites. Easy to teach and learn, plays fast, short setup time, nice production. There's hardly any downtime, and plays pretty fast.

Downside to this in comparison to Rails over Europe (and why this isn't a 10), is the unnecessary large map. The map favors the northeast heavily. Routes are represented by cards which are not visible to people on the other end of the huge map. Interaction is lower, and Western Link feature sucks.

All in all, great game, but get Rails over Europe in addition to this!!

Solid enough game with a huge, beautiful board that fits my game table perfectly!!  Like the variability of set up but don't like the role cards all that much or the fact that we have so many house rules to try to make the game work better.  It is generally fun, but New England can really swing the game vs. the West unless more than 2 players go there which then makes it easier for the other players....board color problem is also a little annoying.....

Just Fine. Amazing game. As if the game´s great aspect, or its excellent mechanics werent enough,  the balance and fun factor come together to bring the most awesome train game I've ever played. I still haven't played Age of Steam, but I don´t think my Railroad Tycoon experience will be bested by another train board game.
The only issue I've seen to this game so far, is the playing time: more than three hours.
The more games I play, the more I like this game.

2006-12-28: I've found another issue: Board Size. You really miss a lot from "the other half".

2007-01-27: I played Age of Steam last night. It provides the tension that, sometimes, misses this game. Even though, I will play RRT ANYTIME. Now that I've played AoS, this game goes down to 6.

As a long time 18xx fan, I was pleasantly surprised by this title. 
Definitely a super adaptation of my favorite PC game of all time (bought Sid Meier's RR Tycoon in Oct1991 and played the heck out of it for about 2 years!!!)
It doesn't compare to 18xx, however, it's a lot easier to get 4 others together for 2 hours than for the 6+ hours needed for an 18xx game.
If I'm with mature players I would still go with Age of Steam.  However, I somehow keep thinking about this beautiful game with great replayability!

RATING: 7.5
The updated version of Age of Steam. The main differences are that in a turn, there are 3 rounds, and everyone gets to execute any action of their choice (urbanize, increase links, deliver goods). There are also cards that give VPs for achieving a certain goal, such as connecting cities. There are also secret condition VPs as well. This is a nice component game, more forgiving than AoS, and fun to play. I'm sure this game will generate countless debate about which game is better to play.

Played twice with 6 and once with 3. Simpler version of Age of Steam that does not work. Map is way too big even for 6 players. Special cards are rather random. Auction for the turn-order is terribly boring. Way too long for a game with almost no decision making. In addition, the components are quite bad. Terrible color choices of the cities. Huge unnecesally pieces just to indicate that city is empty.

I prefer this to Age of Steam...not because it's bigger, newer, and prettier, but because it's less tightly focused, it works (surprisingly well) with only two players, and your score doesn't decline with your income.  It certainly isn't perfect, though.  There can be major runaway leader problems, there are two identical pairs of Tycoon bonus cards (which means that if two players get dealt the same one, at least one of them can't possibly get the bonus...unfair!), and the fact that bidding is only for going first means that being seated to the left or right of the most aggressive bidder can make or break you.  (This is one aspect in which Age of Steam is clearly the better game;  no constantly going second for free!)

Definitely a good game after one play, though I experienced pretty much all the component issues that others did.  This game is so close to being great but stupid production quality errors get in the way of gameplay too often to ignore.  Despite all of that, this will be a minimum rating of 7 for me and likely to increase with repeated play, especially with more players.

Really enjoyable, open, route planning game. Some elements of pick up and deliver, and a nice player interaction aspect when you can cause other players problems by connecting to a city before them.

Quite simply one of the greatest games ever made. The reason I like it more than Steam or Age of Steam is simply that it is just more fun. It is exciting to play, doesn't limit you like those games do, the cards change things up and now with all the expansions you can't go wrong.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Since the initial round, during which most of the debt is taken on and balance-wrecking opening cards are distributed (such as Land Grab), can swing the outcome of the game so much, it kind of begs the question, why spend the next 2.5 to 3 hours playing when the likely winner (either player #2, who got to choose the 2nd best move free of charge, or player #1, who got to choose the best card for a paltry sum) has already emerged. I don't have a good answer for this, other than the game is kind of fun anyway. However, I prefer games where the deciding factors take place closer to endgame rather than being [i]fait accompli[/i] from get go.
----
Subsequent play, not that much fun -- the game just took too long. This could have been a function of the players and not the game. But if this is actually a 1-1.5 hour game, I'd give it back the points I just docked. Amending my earlier statement, twice out of, maybe 4 times now, the winner has been someone who built a series of circular routes, who was not either player #1 or #2.

Our 1st game (with 6) was fantastic. Although it took almost 4 hours (with rules explanation and lots of socializing), it never felt long.

RATING: 6.3
The production quality is really huge.

I really think this is an only 6-player game, but up to now I've only managed to play 3 and 4 players games. Said that, I think:
-> The money system is not perfect. It works during the first half/third of the game, but then you just have money to spare.
-> The card system doesn't work very well. The cards can become stuck because nobody is interested on (or fulfills the objectives of) the 3 current cards. I guess this will be less usual with 6 players.
-> I have the impression that the are you choose to start and the competition you have define greatly your chance at winning.

Still, the game has more strategic component that it initially seems, especially with the urbanization option.

Otherwise, it's a fun medium to light game, with very easy to learn rules and fast flow.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First impression: It is very similar to Age of Steam except it is much more approachable in many ways. Compared to AoS the board looks better and components are plastic miniatures instead of wooden cylinders. Personally I like Age of Steam's plain and even crude looks. Turn order isn't as strict as in AoS and there are some new element added. I like the idea of operation cards and how they fit this AoS-light approach very well. Overall the game is good but a bit dumped down version of AoS. 

We played using AoS-style auction instead of original rules. That worked out very well and eliminates the problem that player to left of auction's winner would otherwise benefit too much without paying for it. This can be especially important in the first turn and less so on later ones (depends on the new operation card revealed).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I played only with 2 and 3 people. The map is too big for few players - I need to get smaller map for that. The game ends quickly. I especially like the funding mechanism - if you overinvest at the beginning you fall in a loop when you need to borrow more and more as you cannot afford dividend.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Love this one, and found that it appeals to non gamers once they get past the bits and size of the board. I have not personally ever played AoS so I can't make that comparison, but I always find this a great experience and even enjoy it with 2. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Played 4 times. I am really not convinced with cards, which looks like a "fake good idea" especially in my 4-players games. The one to deliver a 3 ressources cube is potentially also getting the 4 locomotive. Then this one gets enough advance to have a clear win.I really like the system of not having to calculate your share before your turn (really fluid), but definetly Age of Steam (which is NOT my favourite game of all time) is far better and more tense and interesting. A game once in a while why not...

Beautiful looking  and a good game as well. It does suffers from being a bit big, which is the usual Eagle Games problem - but that's just my personal gripe.

Firstly : Underrated game here.

For general RT series :
Game is simply great with only one word. I will explain later why it is great.

For Railroad Tycoon (RT, 8.0): 
I placed an 20-30 kg ikea table upside down and below it railroad tycoon map, waited one week. Than with great hopes I turned the table and get my map back. But 3 pieced huge RT map is still warped. 

For Railways of Europe (RE, 8.2):
Only because of map warp problem at RT I gave RE +0.5 points more than railroad tycoon. Better and smaller map. RE is far better for 3-4 player games. On the other side RE has a loss of -0.2 because of no western link or similar option on east which is very less used part of map, especially we hate Athens, not because of it is Greek city of course, we love Greeks. But this part of map is very hard to use. Of course RT has lots of unusable areas too. RE has +0.1 because of better and more useful card variaty and +0.2 for default connections bonus links on board. RT has +0.2 more because it was older and first design of that serie.

Also for only blue-purple-black confusion game loses 0.1 points in both RE and RT. You designed an excellent game but cannot paint it in a good way.

The board on this one is horribly cheap and warps easily.  The rest of the game pieces are tremendous.  I like the game play on this game and the get more $$ for scoring mechanic (i.e., your income goes down after a certain point to allow for others to catch up).  One draw back is the size of the board, it may not fit on smaller tables.

A beautiful game, with super components! The rulebook is extremely vague and there isn't an official FAQ to answer the most basic of questions, even after all these years! This is a big fault with the game! The game is awesome however...a bit cut-throat and a bit long...but fun when you get the rules figured out and things run smoothly! I do wonder about the Tycoon cards! They only seem to offer a paltry amount of points to the game end, to really make much of a difference to winning conditions! Unlike TTR's ticket cards, you are not allowed to redraw or add any other Tycoon cards to your hand for the rest of the game! I really like the income track...offers a nice balance of money and progress! I appreciate and enjoy this mechanic to the game! It creates an insatiable drive to do and build more...but not too much too soon...or the money goes down! But keep building...or you won't have enough victory points for the end game! Tricky balance!

My brother in law commented once that if things aren't going well for you...you can see the end coming...but it takes a long time to get there!

I have mixed feelings about the item merge...probably the right thing to do.  My comment below was for the original Railroad Tycoon and its rules.  I love Railways as well, but not the rule modifications for the Eastern US board.  I like the greater variety and energy and rewards for risk taking with the original.  I also seems that about 5-6 plays on my father-in-laws Railways of the World board did not get added to my Railroad Tycoon plays, so I may have a few more than currently recorded.

Fun with all #'s.  Many different strategy possibilities.  Different every time.  I love this game!  The combination of planning, auction, and random elements is perfect.  My absolute favorite game--#1.

I own Railroad Tycoon and I'm not rating this separately.  We always play this using the original water rules and the original using the 2 tycoon draw rule.  We love the new hex between Mobile and New Orleans.  We go back and forth over the 4th link into New York and whether we like the 4-train or 4 colors of cubes starting bonus card better.

RATING: 8.5
Initial impression was very favourable - the "Droverisation" of Age of Steam appears to have gone off without a hitch.  Others have already listed the various changes between this and AoS, but I will point out four tweaks that I feel make the game more user-friendly and less cutthroat (not to mention bringing the learning curve down to a more 'casual' gamer level):
1) All initial goods cubes start the game on the board.  The AoS mechanic of rolling for production always bugged me, as it meant that you could get hosed by die rolls in what is otherwise a very deep 'gamer' game.  In RT, the board is much easier to survey and the 'good' spots to start the game are more easily spotted.
2)Shares can be issued at any time.  This is very nice, since it removes the start-of-round math session from AoS where all players try and calculate what they'll need this turn - and woe to them if they calculate wrong or get blocked by someone else.  In RT, you issue 'em when you need 'em - much easier to handle for players not used to having to plan far in advance.
3) Income track starts at 3.  A seemingly minor change, it means that a player issuing 2 shares at the start of the game only needs to complete a single 1-link delivery to be above break-even point.  Compare this to the AoS model where you have 2 shares to start as well as upkeep on your engine meaning that you need to ship 3 cubes before you can even tread water - clearly, AoS is more punishing in its financial model.  A major turn-off for non-hardcore players.
4) All goods may only be shipped along links where the first link is owned by the shipping player.  Again, a seemingly minor tweak, but it makes the game a lot less cutthroat since it's now harder for others to ship cubes out from under your nose.  This means that you can plan ahead in comfort and usually be sure that your plans won't be completely undone by the time your turn hits.  In AoS, I always found there to be more downtime as players scrambled to adjust to the board position that the previous player left them.  For all its size and sweeping scope, RT moves along at a surprisingly decent clip.

I will still play AoS, but only with a certain group.  RT will likely be the game of choice whenever a lighter, more engaging version of the game is called for - and as long as the game holds up to my initial impressions, I can see that being the case more often than not.

Update: Have now played 3 times.  My only concern thus far is the occasional 8-10 point "Major Line" card coming up when it's nearly a gimme for one player.  Perhaps cut the value in half in those situations?  Hardly a major quibble and I've actually raised my rating by half a point as of this update.

I've heard GREAT things about this game, and have enjoyed the RRT series on PC.

RATING: 6.5
A good solid middle weight game. There's lots of setup, but it does look good, although there are a few minor production issues (colour, warp, low quality cards) but they don't harm the game too much.

The game design is a bit rough around the edges in terms of luck of the draw (initial Tycoon cards, major lines), the turn order auction (2nd player gets a big free advantage), and the way the map is highly asymmetric. RRT:Europe addresses most of these issues, as does the reprint "Railways of the World"  

EDIT: I fixed the colour issue by *painting* the blue hexes the right shade of blue after a few plays (I was getting fed up of saying "oh by the way the colours are wrong so those pinky-purple hexes are the purple cities and those purple hexes are the blue cities"...grrr) 

Bought Nov 2005

Map too big, too many hexes, meaning players rarely use anyone else's track which is the key part of the other games like this. That and poor graphic design and rules just made me want to play Steam instead.

I've come to prefer the original Railroad Tycoon over Age Of Steam, liking the variety and the luck of the cards. The imbalance of the American map is unfortunate because approaches don't vary much between games. The European map generates more competition, more route variety and an overall tenser affair. The auction is a touch too simplistic and unfair on the new last player, but there's much to like in the game. The challenge and aim is to identify and develop 4, 5 and 6 length routes and execute on them before other people steal the cubes, whilst needing to get small 1 and 2 length routes executed quickly so that your net balance (income over share cost) is ahead as quickly as possible. Therefore plenty to think about and plenty of competition to make life challenging.
The Mexico map doesn't provide anything much new or special, just map variety for 3 or 4 players. It encourages players to progress around the edges to get the city-to-city building bonus points though, and there's not a lot in the middle to entice you in anyways. Our one 3 player game saw a lot of independent track building / running until we were up to 5 or so links and then touching on each other's cities. There'll obviously be more congestion with 4 players though, so play with the number that suits the type of game you prefer.

A pleasant track-building, cube-delivering train game. The Mexico map may tend toward uneven initial cubes, forcing a lot of competition. 

Beautiful boards, but the score track is way too small since you use the locomotives as markers.

The weight without the cards is probably about 2.4. With the cards maybe 2.8 or so.

RATING: 8.5
Excellent game.  The Baron cards provided changes in strategy from one game to the next, and reduce the odds that everyone starts along the coast.  Definitely enjoy the bidding variant, as more than one person pays for their turn order (in most turns at least.)

A new hit in the group, a lot of rules to get to grips with initially but it all flows nicely, still getting to grips with the tactics and such. Gorgeous to look at. Board can be a bit spaced, especially with fewer players, still waiting for a healthy, competitive 5 or 6 player game.

Having just played this and Steam in a week, RT has lost a little of it's shine. 
Too easy for the rich to get richer.
When I play again I will definitely use the recommended variant (standard in the other maps) and lay all the routes out at the start

12/18/11 - Who knew I was a train game guy. I had a great time laying track and moving cubes. The game looks so great with all the tracks, cubes, trains and empty city markers. It offers up plenty strategical options through card bonuses, barons and cube delivery. I was very satisfied playing Railways and would love to play it again. It gets a solid 8 rating from me.

Really nice game. Played once and looking forward to a second try, now that I know better what NOT to do... 

Having noted the board warping problems of others (and how my copy doesn't sit flat on the table already) I had a sheet of clear Perspex (acrylic glass) cut to the exact size of the board. As it is the biggest board I own, it will come in useful for other games too. Problem solved, but not cheaply.

A great train game that has a lot of variables. There is less of a blocking aspect here with the actual laying of track (a la Ticket to Ride), more thinking ahead required and getting there before others since it is best to use other peoples actions to your advantage. A must play (but you need a large table!)

Great game with some balance issues with the Eastern U.S map.  The turn order can be unfair but there are fixes out there to make the auction for turn order more fair.  The included Mexico map is great.  The operations cards with the Mexico map are more fun/interesting than those with the Easter US map (and perhaps even better than the Europe map).

Definitely a more enjoyable, flavorful and colorful version of Age of Steam.  Some of the cards seem out of whack in the payout for some deliveries/lines and also in the likelyhood of completion the New York-Chicago and Western link.  1st printing board warpage is an issue but hasn't drastically affected our gameplay.  Fixing the blue city color and perhaps shifting the round track to be entirely on one board would be quite welcome additions to an otherwise beautiful and playable map.  But, why would anyone ever build in the southwest region???

I really like trying to manage your rail network with limited funds in this game.  Unlike Ticket to Ride, this game is NOT about building track, but rather about delivering goods.  However, the game does have its flaws, mostly resulting from an unbalanced map and unbalanced cards.  The turn order auction is very unsatisfactory as well, the role auction in Age of Steam is far superior.

Big. Heavy. Great components. German-style play. Based on one partial play with son. More to come. 4/06: played a fantastic 2-player game with nephew. We both took it very seriously and it came down to the wire. I was completely riveted by every turn! Only caveats: the train theme may turn off some folks, it takes a lot of room to play, I think new players are at a big disadvantage during their first play against a veteran.

Oct 2014: I kept hoping this would come to the table more, and have held onto it for a long time. I've just never had any friends that were into "trains". It really needs to be traded away.

This game has the distinction of costing me the most money of any game: I was moving into a new home at the time this came out, and I took the board to the furniture store I was shopping with my wife at, to size up the table I would need to have to play these large games. I bought a table and chairs, and my wallet was $1,600 lighter as a result.

Quite the enjoyable train game. It's nicely produced and quite pretty. The maps are HUGE. It's a bit too much luck driven to be as fun as I'd like it to be. My biggest annoyance with the game is the severe lack of track pieces in things other than gentle curve and straight. Sometimes you really need a hard curve. My other gripe with the game is the cards can be really swingy in a bad way. Getting 4+ points in addition to what you just did can really add up quickly.

I still vastly prefer Age of Steam/Steam to this game, but it's a much "nicer" experience and plays well with most gamer types. This game is surprisingly tough at times though and you can really get into problems with the amount of bonds/income you get. Or at least the Mexico map can be a bit brutal with 2 if all the goods cubes are in horrible places.

I enjoy all the maps so far, but England/Wales has to be my favorite, followed by Europe, Mexico and the Time Maps. I don't really care for the main 6 player map that the base comes with. It's far too broken to be fun.

One additional complaint that's surfacing the more that I play it. Money is so loose in this game most of the time. We played a 3 player map with 2 players and we had almost ~$100 a piece at one point. We had 8 total loans between the 2 of us. This game is crazy loose. Fun, but man do I miss the tension in Steam/Age of Steam.

Variants used: 

[b]AOS bidding system[/b]: Hate the rules as written for this game. 2nd player has too much of an advantage for not paying a damn thing. If you bid, you're likely to pay something.

[b]Track redirect[/b]: Sometimes you get screwed over and need to redirect your track. 2k.

[b]Building over previous track[/b]: 3k always. Makes it much simpler.

Many people don't like pick up and deliver. Did not get played.

UPDATE: after more play the "9" feels solid. I really like this game. Some games tend to get analytical, but a game of RRT feels more like playing than gaming. But RRT is devious that way - winning the game is a real challange with competitive people. 3-payer games works almost as good as 4-player games. 

Just played once, but it was a really good experience. Love to try it more.

Really engaging game with an enjoyable strategic depth. Not too heavy, not too light - it is an enjoyable experience each play. The beautiful, overproduced components are so great!

After 50 plays: rating 10->8 (The reason? Last 5-6 sessions have been mostly non satisfying as a gaming experience).

After play 51 - I´m not interested to play this game very often anymore. Current rating could be even 6. But as it was one of my favourite games and I have had a lot of great sessions with it, I´ll leave the rating at 8.

2-plays in, one six player on the standard map and one two player in Europe.  Absolutely loved both experiences.  The game is highly interactive; we got pretty nasty in our two-player game, you can get creative devising beneficial actions that also screw your opponent.  The six player game saw less screwage, but everyone was still in each others business racing for goods and inserting links in others networks.  There's a lot to think about in the game, but it still moves at a good pace (six newbies took 3 hours).  Excited for more plays.

Wow, this game has a really big board.... it cracks me up every time I read a review or session report for RRT because they almost always start with this. Of course, I opened the box for the first time and said "Wow, that's a really big board" myself.

My hubby gives this one a 10.... and it's definitely right up there for me. The mechanic of actually laying down raidroad track tiles pretty much anywhere you'd like makes it so much fun. We've only played two-player, so we've done away with the turn order auction, which I imagine adds a lot of challenge to the game if you have more players.

Updated to add: Finally had a chance to play with more than two. I'm not sure I liked it as much-- it made the game a lot longer and there was a lot of down time. Still, a solid game, however!

This would definitely get more play with a smaller board... we both really love this game.

A slightly heavier train game than Ticket to Ride that is still easy enough to teach new players. This is a decent euro game that could still use some stream lining. I have never been a fan of wonky scoring systems but I will play this. What is inexcusable is that Eagle-Gryphon Games does not publish the rules to this online in PDF format.

Pros:
* Good quality components.
* Huge game board.

Cons:
* [b]-1 for Eagle-Gryphon Games not publishing the rules online in PDF format. Inexcusable.[/b]
* You can easily run out of table space to play this game as the game board may actually be too big.
* Wonky score tracking board and scoring system.
* I am not a big fan of the perpetual debt system and the corresponding negative points.
* You can easily get in a debt spiral that is impossible to recover from.
* The additional Mexico map is horrible.

I came at this after several plays of Age of Steam.  Both have very similar systems, but Tycoon has a lot more bells and whistles.  AoS has the harsher economic system, but Tycoon will punish you, too.  Knowing the various Tycoon bonuses and what the cards do is kind of a pain in the first play of Tycoon, and the map seems to have more options, but I'm not sure that it does, as you're doing 3x as many things per turn.  It's primary advantage is being pretty enough and simple enough for less hard core players, and I was thrown by a couple subtle rule changes from AoS to Tycoon, including the way the game ends (the turn AFTER someone triggers the max. empty city # - in AoS it's a set # of turns).

The biggest drawback to this game for me is that it doesn't fit on any table I own; so I just bring it to other people's houses! If you like rail games this is a great one. I can't compare it to Age of Steam (I haven't played AoS yet) but RRT is a great game in its own right. However, I am tempted to add a little length to the game by requiring an extra empty city marker or two. The Rails of Europe expansion is a good addition and thanks to the smaller board I can play it on my kitchen table!
[Update]: I think the game length works fine and now I have a new kitchen table that can handle the big board. Game on!

RATING: 8.5
Train game that feels somewhat similar to the crayon rails games but without the actual train movement. Instead planning/building routes and deliveries is the focus here, with additional auction & income elements that require you to manage your spending in a similar way to Power Grid.

Plays ok with 2 but the map is definitely too large, so there is little competition and a very abrupt end to the game (perhaps playing to more than the prescribed number of empty cities would help?). The Rails of Europe expansion map is probably better for 2 players.

Excellent components although the box is unusually large, and the board is quite possibly the biggest I've seen (only Arkham Horror may come close).

OWN: International Edition which consists of mainly English-language components with a few non-English parts (board and some unimportant contents of cards).

NOTE: New edition planned (2009?) will be a new base game with a paper map of Mexico instead of the original map of eastern USA (which will be a separate expansion).

After two plays.  The first play I misunderstood the rules as they were being explained to me, and buried myself in debt on the first round.  Still a fun game though, although I lost badly.  The second play was a lot better, with more action.  I really like this game, one must choose which actions to take and how to manage their resources.  I think it would be fun with more players as well, as I have only played with 2.

Probably my favorite game.  My group started planning ahead and preemptively building on the service bounty cities.  But when first timers don't know where those are, or understand the implications when you tell them, it's a big advantage.  So we started randomizing the service bounties by pulling a random city from a bag (with all the city names printed on them) each time a service bounty card come up.  We enjoy the variant, especially when playing with people who haven't played before.

RATING: 7
I've read reviews of Age of Steam and the word "brutal" has put me off that design, and hearing RR was a friendlier version and getting good reviews I gave it a go. The best railgame ever? I've played a few and RR twice has convinced me this could be as good as it gets (in my eyes). Emotionally, RR feels the same as Ticket to Ride: you lay "track" to push your score ahead on scoring circuit, but at game end penalities will subtract your score. But I find a 2hr session of RR more interesting and gratifying than any 2 games of TtR back to back.

This is a somewhat simplified and streamlined version of Age of Steam, which is put down by some AoS purists. I agree that RRT is a little less strategic than AoS and the turn order mechanism is watered down, but I think RRT is still a decent game on its own. In fact, as far as the way the resource cubes are brought onto the board, I like it better the way RRT handles it.

A fun and tense game; just make sure you have a big enough table to accommodate the giant 3-piece gameboard plus additional space for cards, pieces, etc!

Tetszett, bár azzal a jó szereplésemnek lőttek, hogy az elején utolsónak, azaz 6.-nak kerültem sorra. Gyakorlatilag a legjobb helyekre betelepültek a többiek mire én következtem. Ennek ellenére 3 profi mögött a negyedik helyen fejeztem be a játékot.
A játék kivitelezése kiváló, szépek az elemek és a tábla, kár hogy olyan nagy, hogy fel kell állni ahhoz, hogy átlássa az ember a térképet!

This 'fixes' some of the problems I had with Age of Steam. In particular, the game is fun. Unfortunately, RRT has introduced a new set of problems but not as critical as those found in the parent game.

RATING: 5
I like this game. It makes me want to try Age of Steam. It's somewhat simple. However, I don't like the cards. They lead to break aways and are annoying since there are so many out at the set up. It's hard to keep track of them all. I'd rather not play with them. I've been told that Rails of Europe solves this issue. Will have to investigate.

RATING: 8
Great game with the main downside beeing its size. It is difficult to keep up to date on the entire map, and also on which cards are active if you are not sitting next to them (I have uploaded a small sheet tht helps you keep track of that).

RATING: 7
I used to rate this a '10', but having just played it for the first time since playing Steam,  I find Steam to be a more elegant design, and easier to teach. RT is still good enough that I'd probably never turn down a game.

Of the three near-identical Wallace railroad games,this is his most thematic. I like the larger board, I like the unnecessary plastic bits to mark empty cities, and I love the action cards that consist mostly of men with awesome mustaches. 

Every action takes some thought and planning. I love trying to figure out if it pays to build a railroad around someone else's route or it it's better to ship goods over their route and share in points.

Viel Licht und Schatten: die Komponenten sehen toll aus, der Aktienmechanismus gefällt mir richtig gut und das Spiel bietet viele taktische Kniffe und Möglichkeiten. Großes Manko sind die Regeln, die zwar kurzgefasst sind, mir aber das Gefühl gaben, geistig zurückgeblieben zu sein. Außerdem gab es zu oft den Spielmoment, dass man gar keine Aktion machen wollte, weil für diesen Moment einfach nur negative Effekte generiert werden können. Dadurch wird das Spiel träge.

Lots of replay value due to random goods placement during setup.  Strategy must account for very unbalanced board.  Nobody can be left uncontested in the northeast.  But fighting there too much can reduce score allowing the uncontested elsewhere to win.  Some tycoon cards seem easier to complete than others and the random card draw can sometimes swing the game.

I love this game so much, everything about the design is just so great.  I like that you bid to go first each turn, and I love that you start with no money and immediately have to start managing loans.  Lastly, I love that the game's end condition can be highly controlled by the players themselves.

There's just so much that I really love about this game.  It is fairly long which I really enjoy but it never gets too long and you never feel like you're not doing anything.  The randomness of the goods placement can occasionally make for an unbalanced play, but at the same time I love that you always have to change your plans each time you play.

The European Rails expansion for this is a 10.  The original Railroad Tycoon has a confusingly oversized board (it will not fit on any table, and the west is so spread out you lose if you build there which confuses new players), but is still a great, simple-to-understand Railroad game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is an excellent variant of Age of Steam, and I prefer Railroad Tycoon to Age of Steam.

(My copy is the original version published as Railroad Tycoon, later editions had a change of name to Railways of the World.)

Railroad Tycoon has very little in common with the excellent Railroad Tycoon 3 computer game. (Although I have played RT3 for many hundreds of enjoyable hours.)

Two expansions, Rails of Europe and Railways of England and Wales, are both excellent expansions for Railroad Tycoon.  However, Railways of England and Wales also includes an optional 'Advanced' game set of rules which is essentially a light version of 18xx, and this version of the game I rate as a 9.

Awesome components - I liked age of steam, but having a game not quite as tight leads to a easier game. While the auctions are critical to age of steam, here the auctions are a problem. After the initial turns don't seem to be as much of a driving force - forcing you to concentrate on routes, deliveries and money management. Even so the round robin from the auction winner doesn't work well. There needs to be some sort of drop out mechanism to set the order.

This map Not very scalable with fewer players - will need to get other maps or use a variant the limits the main map

Railroad Tycoon is a great game!  Players build railroads that connect sities and can then deliver goods from one city to another along their railroad network.  But be careful that you don't borrow too much money!  There is a critical concept of balancing the borrowing of money with the returns that are able to be made with that money.  If you're not careful you can lose this game early on, but that also makes things fun!

Egyértelműen az egyik, - ha nem a legjobb - vonatos játék. De vitathatatlanul a legszebb. Érdekes a "magyarítás" része is.
ÓRIÁSI a játéktábla, már-már túlzóan is, nehéz átlátni. De annyi lehetőség van a játékban, hogy eszméletlen. De az egyszerűnek mondható szabályok ellenére, nagyon komoly játékról van szó. Én magam nagyon elszúrtam, de végig tervezhető volt és izgalmas, annak ellenére, hogy rossz irányból közelítettem meg a játékot. Kicsit a Steam erősségeit és stratégiáit akartam kihasználni, de itt ez eltolódik más irányba. Egyértelműen nem ugyanarról szól a játék és a benne rejlő taktikák, stratégiák is teljesen mások.
Azt kell mondjam megfér egymás mellett a kettő. A steam nehezebb, ez meg sokkal szebb:)
Update: hagytak észak-keleten randalírozni, így meg is nyertem.

Great game. You can play it with hardcore gamers, or with your family. Fun, exciting, and engaging. Requires strategic and tactical playing, and is almost totally devoid of luck. I love it! Beautiful, huge board, nice bits.

Edit: A little too forgiving on bad moves and stupid plays. The fact that the game allows for a player to issue unlimited stocks allows stupid players to play badly, without being punished for it (except at the end, when they'll lose).

Oh, it could have been a "10".  However, it is the flaws that stand out and drag it down - the board (where blue=purple and the whole thing takes on a gentle curve 30 minutes after opening the box) and the cards (not all Tycoons are created equal, and if your bonus turns up a just the right time ...).

That said, this was one of my favourites of 2005.  OK, so it requires a gargantuan table, but ignore comments that this is "no Age Of Steam".  Indeed not - it's far more approachable and dare I say it fun.  Some people will prefer the cut-throat, hardcore, brain-burning intensity of RRT's older brother, but I like the way that ordinary people can sit down and enjoy a railway game without headaches.  

So long as the light is good enough to tell blue from purple, anyway.   

But I've been seduced away from Railroad Tycoon by a new railway game ...

It's a semi-enjoyable challenge, but it is a flawed version of the game - the obvious, well-documented mistakes in the components and board detract from what could be a good game.

It takes a certain hardcore gamer to enjoy going into debt to even acquire the base resources needed to start the game. I see this recommended for new gamers, and I feel this is a bad recommendation for that reason.

I finally got to play this. There were three other players who all had a good grasp on it, so I was a bit slower to get things going, even though I had a decent chunk of the NE corner. I came in last, but I think I was only about 10 points behind the first player. I would have been with the other two if I had been able to complete my card, but I only shared the least number of stocks, so I lost points that put me back on the first side of the board (50, i think).

I will definately be willing to try this again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Much MUCH more enjoyable than Age of Steam or the 18xx series of railroad games because of many factors. In this one, you concentrate on building a railroad in the most efficient way, competing with other players for scarce resources. Everyone can improve their trains on the SAME turn! Everyone can build track on the SAME turn! You don't have to spend half your time on Wall Street defending your company against raiders! In short, Railroad Tycoon is about the TRAINS!! Hey, that's what a railroad game SHOULD be about. Ok, that said, I'm not sure I'd want to play it every week. It's a rather long game and the only thing you can do while waiting for other players to make their moves is to tell them what they should be doing, which often annoys them. It was fun, and I think playing it every few months or so will keep it that way.

The first railroad game I have played.    Huge board that makes plotting ahead difficult to the novices, but otherwise good quality bits.  I get "chess-ed" into a corner often by more experienced players.  I like that this game involved less conflict-driven auctioneering than say, Power Grid.  I  definitely have a recreational gaming outlook moreso than a competitive one.  I can see competitive people enjoying this game more than I did.  I might play this again, but I won't go out of my way to find opportunities.

Overall the game was  a lot of fun and looked great. The stock mechanic was a lot of fun.  The secret victory cards added a nice unknown factor. I love the empty city markers. I'm sure the game will go much faster in future plays. 

The massive size of the game presented problems, hard to see the cards available for most players and difficult to see all your track building and delivery options. The blue/purple cities kept screwing folks up.

I traded Age of Steam for this game because I thought Age of Steam was a game I could play with my gaming friends, but RRT was a game I could (eventually) play with my family.  I think I made the right choice.  RRT has a lot of the things I like about AoS without some of the brain burning problems, coupled with a more forgiving set of restrictions.  AoS junkies might dismiss it as messing up a great thing, but it fits a niche for me.  Plus I find it really easy to explain to new players - great game.

Has to be played with the appropriate number of players, 3/4 for Railways of Mexico and 5/6 for the eastern US map. An epic game and great components in this version. I don't think it looses much in comparison to Age of Steam, as many others do. The game feeling and experience is the same, even though it's not as cutthroat as AoS.

Players 2-6, best with 5.  OMG.. the game board itself takes up a whole 3' by 4' table.  The first game took over 4 hours... But it is really great.  It's like Ticket to Ride on steroids.

Age of Steam lite. Made from the original, with removing much competition from auctions, bigger board (witch makes less competition for routes) and random cards. Basicly spoiled AoS.

RATING: 6.5
This is the first Martin Wallace train game I played (besides Brass, which I would not count here) and I really liked it. Expanding your rail empire, deliver goods, and taking loans (actually equity) all are very thematic. The components (especially  the map) are really beautiful for a train game. The layout of the differnt goods (cube colors) offers some setup variability.

However, I think the operation cards are a bit too random and the ensuing turn order feels tacked on. Also the initial goals (first to deliver good over range 3 and so on) seem like rich-get-richer to me.

Updated rating. Yep, this is the best iteration of the system, the best track-laying and delivery game, and simply an all-around great game.

========================================================

Very enjoyable. Handsome components. Doesn't overstay its welcome.

Plays cleaner than Age of Steam or Steam. Does punish early mistakes and inefficiencies - just not as brutally as those games. The railways operations cards and bonus routes are nice enhancements. They give Railways of the World a looseness and variability that the other games lack. 

This looks like it will become our railway game of choice. We often end a game of Age of Steam or Steam with bitterness and recriminations - the cramped computational horizon of those games lead to a sour tone.  That feeling is dispelled in this iteration of the system.

Railroad Tycoon gets rid of all the gamey excess crap from Age of Steam and turns it into a really nice family style game.  It looks fabulous set up on the table.  Eagle Games did a fantastic job with this one.  I wish they had shortened the game to 90 or 120 minutes.

I had a great time playing this. It's fast moving and approachable from all skill levels. I play MANY train games, but have never really enjoyed playing AoS.  RT has taking the intriguing aspects of AoS and made it exciting and elegant without the dry, AP pitfalls and suffocating finacial system. EAGLE GAMES should reissue the board or make available flat roll-up maps.

Great Game. 
There are so many ways to win and thwart would be winners that I seem to try something new each time. Player interaction is great and there is about as much direct conflict as you can get without a war game. I personally like the bidding for turn order as well as random cube draws.
I give this a 10 for the simple fact that I always enjoy the game when I play it. It is easy to learn, has tons of options each turn, but yet it can be taught and picked up by new players in a few turns.
Just what I want from a game.

After repeated plays with several game groups, this game never fails to be satisfying. A solid 10 game for me.

1/7/12 After another play, this game is still a 10 for me!

Age of Steam with a freaking huge map (Which greatly reduces player interaction), ALL of the hard decisions surgically removed and lots of random elements (special events and tycoon goals) added.

The board is so oversized and with the addition uf cards you have to read tiny text from 6 feet away shows Eagle games is run by people with no clue in human factors design.  

This is Age of Steam with gigantism--hopelessly huge and stupid.  

It is only "easier" and "less stressful"  to play because there are NO meaningful decisions to the entire play time.  Spread out and do the freaking obvious move.  The winner ends up winning because of random card draw that gives him an extra bonus because he was "smart" to have started there.

Might have been useful as a 5 or 6 player variant for AOS because of the large map.   But RRT is so neutered I can no longer recommend it.

I tried this game last night, and it wasn't too bad. However, I felt that there were some portions of the game that had a disproportionate impact on the result for the amount of effort required. For instance, satisfying the constraints on the green circle cards gave an early game boost that was difficult to overcome. Additionally, the northeast is far too strong a starting place. The inherent competition there seems to dilute the point of the game.

I really dislike how large the game board is. . . it's unwieldy and prone to disaster.

A wonderfully-designed game.  I think it's Martin Wallace's best, and more accessible to my family than "Age of Steam."  A very immersive theme of building the railroads and using them.  There are wonderful feelings of "aha!" when you spot an opportunity that everyone else has been missing -- along with wonderful feelings of frustration when someone else does the same to you.  Players have won with all kinds of different strategies, from monopolizing the northwest to exploiting the western corridor.  Would love to see additional maps.

Want to feel drawn into a game? Take one look at the gorgeous, sprawling maps of Railways of the World, and you're off on a journey that'll make you forget that you ever thought the words "train game" sounded deadly dull. Competitive yet welcoming, simple but thoughtful, Railways falls right in the sweet spot for light-to-medium gaming as far as I'm concerned. I appreciate designs which can sit players from a wide 'weight range' down at the table together and allow them all to enjoy.

My absolute favourite game!

Random distribution of cubes gives tons of re-play value; if you tire of the North American map, try downloading the European map from this website - it's great too.  We've played the South America map twice now.  As written, there aren't enough cubes, but if you place two cubes on the 1-cube cities, it's a very good map.

I've really enjoyed my plays of this game. I've had a five player game that could have gone to either of three players and was a nail biter to the end. A two player game flows much differently than one with 4 or 5 players, so much so that it's a different game. The competition for resouces isn't as intense and I feel a lot less pressure when making decisions. I will gladly play it with any number of players. The only reason it doesn't see more play time is becuase it is so big and feels like it takes so long to set up.

Great game.  Being a rail nut this game fits well with my playing desires.  You can definitely see the crayon rail influence the game was based on.  I like the tile pieces and almost puzzle like mechanic they add.  I like the delivery/goods/game end mechanic.  Everyone can clearly see what is available and how soon the game will end.  That makes the game a little more cutthroat.  The game does tend to be over quickly though because of that so when playing 2 player we play the best out of three.

--Dec2006-- While I can understand some of the criticisms levelled against this by the AoS gang, my children found this fun and accessible - and they're put off by the unforgiving nature of AoS.  So, despite the "flaws", I found this a delightful gaming experience.  The map is almost too large for my (big) gaming table and the trains are a bit large for the space allotted for scoring markers - but other than that, it's a great package.

Nice 'simplified' version of Age of Steam. My group loved this and I liked it a lot as well. I prefer Age of Steam and I know that it will be difficult to persuade people to play thatin the future. This is simpler, faster and looks better.

I hated the second game I played (with 6). Competed fro Chicago area with one other player. No idea what others were doing. All the others played the game standing up and it's not only because the board is quite big. For others the game felt very exciting. I knew two full turns ahead what I was going to do and otherwise just sat there and waited for others to complete their turn. Dropped the rating from 8.5 to 7.

I'd previously played Age of Steam, and this reworking of it is far less punishing, with everyone having access to all the actions (other than cards) without needing to win a turn order auction at the right time, the ability to take bonds at any time instead of only at the beginning of the turn, and no income reduction every turn.  It still feels quite tight, though, with hard decisions on many turns as to whether to prioritize taking a powerful card, building a key link, or shipping a cube before someone else does.

Yay, it fits on my table! RRT appears to be less chaotic than Age of Steam (due to more cities evening out the cube luck, and action selection replacing role selection), which makes me happy. And the share angst wasn't totally nerfed, and the components are fine also (no board warping on my copy). A great game.

But, do I really need it now that I have 1830?

Update: Nope.

RATING: 10
This is a game where carefully building a network of railroad links between cities is paramount.  The object of the game is to move goods from one city to a target city (based on the color of the city/good).  Players do this by linking the cities together with railroad tracks.  Players only get 3 actions each turn, thus giving the player some tension in deciding the optimal play for the turn.  For each link traversed in the delivery of a good the player whose link was used gains a point on the income track.  After everyone has taken their three actions there is an income phase.  Players have to issue bonds when they need money, and they pay back each bond each turn, so gaining independent income is rather important.  Players do not start the game with money, so debt is inevitable, but controlling how much debt one incurs is part of the game.

The game has a good depth of strategy, and no two sessions will play out the same since the goods are randomized each game.  There is a good balance between upgrading engines, building tracks, and delivering goods, combined with the income track which increases in value until the midpoint, and then decreases.  The income track doubles as the victory point board, so one does want to increase to win the game, but increasing too fast too soon will deprive you of money.

The game is not too deep as to prevent people from playing it, yet it is by no means light.  A good strategy will be clearly rewarded.  The game is somewhat unforgiving for bad play, but there is room and time to recover and put up a good fight.

Wow! It's just all so over the top - this one clearly came from the land of bigger is better! I think the bits are grand - except for the confusing colours. They really could have got away with knocking a few cities off the map, made it two thirds the size, still have had the most stunning board and made the game a little more tense, with a little more conflict (and I wouldn't have to spend most of the game standing so I could walk around to different parts of the table). The game should give you the opportunity to play in different ways and the decisions are reasonably interesting. Player interaction is a little low for my taste, but I think I prefer to Age of Steam for the simplicity of a raw game system. The game has the potential to play quickly and the starting cards and cube distribution should see you playing in different ways each outing. Worth every cent really.

Update: The spectacle is still there, but the shine has worn off. Ultimately you're trying to avoid conflict and congestion. There's whinging when players start too close to one another, negative vibes when cubes are whisked away under the nose of other players and often no congratulations to the winning player for a deserved win - it's all put down to them having flown under the radar and not having been contested enough. There's a sour note to this game that's spreading to all it's permutations. And the number of incarnations of this system has gone crazy. Now we have players who prefer one over another, won't touch one over another, blah, blah, blah. I'm sick of pushing little cubes around anyway guys and gals. They're not real trains! It's just a game with a multitude of different maps to try and convince you you're not bored with the whole efficiency/cube pushing exercise.

I'll still play it every once in a while, and if I had to be playing a train game it'd probably be this. If you need a train game in your collection then this is the one. It's the middle ground train game of choice.

Easy rules in order to make up an epic and outstanding game.  Players are Railroad Tycoons in the Eastern half of USA.  They build rail networks in order to get the most profitable commercial routes.  The money is an important issue at the beginning of the game, so you have to know where and when to spend to get the most victory points out.

Friend introduced us to this a while back. Played a few times over the ensuing weeks. Husband won once, I won once (really beat all those guys!!!), and we liked it enough to buy our own set. We'll probably teach "Ticket to Ride" to our "You're inviting me over to play a boardgame? You mean, like Candyland?" friends first, because it's so much easier to explain and play. But once we have them hooked, we'll move on to this one. (And Puerto Rico and Settlers, of course... Didn't want anyone to think it was just because they're both "train" games that I lumped ToR with RRT...  )

Pick-up-and-deliver train game with a nice pace to it (as long as players plan what they are going to do during their turn on other players' turns). I always have fun playing this.

I wasn't really sure what to expect from Railways of the World. It was the first new game in a while that I hadn't researched much or found out about before actually playing. I knew it was a train game, which didn't particularly excite me.

But this game is great! It's not very heavy at all; the available actions are manageable and easy to understand. But the timing of the actions you take and the board setup is very intriguing. Should I try an claim a route, or should I upgrade my locomotive first? What cards are available, and should I bid for first player? What mission card did I take at the beginning, and should I focus on it? How much debt should I incur?

We played with 5, which I thought worked well on the Western US map, but I don't have much to compare it to. And after only 1 play, it was one of my favorite new-to-me games of 2014.

This is a excellent pickup and deliver games and the theme works ;-)  The city colors and board warp are unfortunate, but don't ruin the game. The colors are easy to remember, and the board warp easily remedied by back-bending. I think RRT's biggest strength (if you're not a bits junky) is in this accessibility to the non-hardcore gamer, but still retains a good depth.

OK this is a really good game.  Good competitiveness between players, can tailor the experience to different levels (using cards and auctions, or leave them out).

And works really well as a 2p! My wife really enjoys it and we play a friendly variant using the cards but just alternating start player (things generally average out).

But can also play a lot more seriously.  It's really not complicated, but there's a fair bit going on and nice tense decisions.

Yes, I'm the guy who said Age of Steam felt like an early prototype of Railroad Tycoon. ;)

A lot better than I thought it'd be. there seems to be some imbalance with one of the Tycoon cards - only 5 points for some incredibly difficult task - so we don't play with that one.

Edit: I think we've been playing with the 5pt tycoon card, but I've been secretly removing the Railroad Exec cards from the deck before we play. We remove 5 or so cards before starting, then bring up 2 new ones per turn (starting with fewer than usual face up) - we think it makes the auctions more interesting more often.

Gran gran juego de trenes, el mejor que he jugado hasta el momento, mucho más divertido que Steam y Age of Steam. El mapa y los impresionantes componentes hacen que entre por los ojos (aunque haya que buscar una muy buena mesa para que entre todo), la facilidad de las reglas y la tensión hace que sea mucho más fácil de jugar, incluso con no jugones. Un imprescindible. No es recomendable para 6 jugadores, y con varias partidas se echa en falta una expansión con un mapa distinto.

A cool train game in the Railroad Tycoon vein.  I own Steam, but I think I would like this more.  Will have to play that at some point as well.  I don't care for the bunchiness of the northeast USA.  Might work better with the Europe map.  Still, a very good game, but there might be runaway leader issues.  Not a favorite mechanic of mine.

Another play of the USA map has dropped this a point for me.  I also think that the cards have a MASSIVE impact.  The winner was essentially determined in turn one.  Looking forward to playing on the Europe map, tho.

So, after my last play of this, I have to bump it up again.  It helps to know what you are doing, that's for sure.  Otherwise, it can lead to a horrible experience.  Now that I DO know what is going on, it was a wonderful game.  I'm sure I will enjoy many further plays of this.

So far, I find myself really enjoying this game.  Surprise, surprise given my love for train games.  I've been kind of put off by the rules in Age of Steam, but this is the type of game that I can get some other folks around here to play.  While it does seem to take a little while to play, this seems to scale back somewhat once you get a game or two under your belt.  All in all, I'm quite happy with the game.

I've really loved Railroad Tycoon for a long time.  It seems as though it would be obvious that the newer addition would share that same love.

I upgraded it from a 5 to a 6 after my last play with 6 people. It's more tense then my first two plays with only 2 persons. Although downtime is still considerable and choices are not abundant...

I've come to the conclusion I really just don't like the base game and most of all the map. But the expansions Europe and England & Wales are awesome.

Upgraded to reflect the rule set and game play besides the original board (which I don't really like). The game is solid

Maybe you're thinking, "I would love to have a railroad-themed board game, but Ticket to Ride is terrible!" That was me, and bless it, I picked up Railways of the World. First of all, Railways is amazingly thematic. Unlike Ticket to Ride where you are just drawing random colors and putting down trains, in Railways you actually feel like a Railroad Tycoon, building track to deliver valuable goods to where they are demanded. It's so much fun, and it's not difficult to learn (the rule book is only a few pages). If you are interested in 19th Century railroad history, this is a no brainer. Get it. Even if you're not interested (my wife) this game is still a lot of fun. I can't wait to get the Western US expansion!

Railroad Tycoon -- Played twice; four- and six-player.  Strong game.  Long game.  

Implementation issues:  The color issues are a problem, and for a game of this caliber (and otherwise high production quality), they really should be rectified.  And the empty city markers, while thematic, would be more functional if they didn't hide the color of the cities they cover.

Juego de trenes en el que hay que llevar las mercancias de unas ciudades a otras, mientras que hacemos vias y mejoramos las locomotoras.
Muy buen juego. Se disfruta de 4 jug a 6.
Tiene 3 grandes pegas:

- Eligieron mal los colores azul y violeta, pues los dáltonicos no las diferenciaran.

- El juego se hace muy largo.

- El tablero es inmenso... eso, unido a todas las piezas que tienes que poner alrededor de el, lo hacen solo apto para mesas muy grandes.

Eso sí, el juego tiene unos componentes preciosos y es muy vistoso una vez desplegado.

Perfect building game that works well with a wide variety of players.  The bits are nicely done, though the board does warp a little around the edges, nothing serious at this point though.  Can't wait to give this more of a workout!

Who knew building railroads could be so fun? This is one of those games where you can come in dead last and still want to play more because the game mechanics are just so entertaining.

I am a huge fan of it and routinely play it after organized gaming sessions with a few other big fans.

[2 plays] Both 5 player game. This is fun, and I have high hopes that it will continue to be fun for a long time. Easily learned by new players, this game boils down all the best parts of Age of Steam without any harsh and inscrutable elements that scare away all but die-hard gamers. The "Eagle bits" are nice, overproduced, cute, and a bit too big and ridiculous all at the same time. I love it.

My second play has me considering some elements to take a closer look at, possible variants to balance the play a bit better. I'll type up some more on that soon.

Most recent play 5-19-06 with Garrett, Michael, Brian P, and Corey.

RATING: 8
A great railroad building game. The mechanics work well and the components are good, creating a appealing experience. The absolute minimum is four players (five or six are better) due to the size of the board.

The only thing really weak about this game is the the board. It's needlessly huge. The size could have been easily reduced just by removing some of the graphics. Furthermore as known the board does wrap. Also the rules are a bit unclear on some occasions.

RATING: 9
I played my first game of RRT tonight, and my initial impressions of the game are very good.  The one thing that I didn't really care for were the tycoon cards.  Some are much easier to complete than others, and an otherwise tight and enjoyable game ended up being decided by the luck of the draw with tycoon cards.  I suppose you could just play without the tycoon cards if no one objected.  One other minor issue is that the purple and blue cities can be hard to distinguish initially.  These minor quibbles aside, this is a great game.

RATING: 6
I love Age of Steam, so this game can't help but to be decent.  But there are just too many niggling things I don't like:  the cards, the fact that bidding for turn order is only for first, the way the goods are replenished, and the way the game ends.  And I usually love production overkill, but this game loses playability because of it.  All that said, it is a decent game and I'd happily play it if that's what everyone else wants.

A great train game that isn't too heavy and isn't too light. I look forward to playing it more and picking up Rails of Europe. I am also looking forward to playing more Martin Wallace designs.

I have become a bit tired of this game after playing it quite often over the last few weeks. But will play it every once in a while. 

2011: Age of Steam has overshadowed this game. I will play this with those that want a simpler game, but my preferred pick up and deliver game is certainly Age of Steam. It offers a much more robust game experience, in my opinion.

Specifically, the tighter money, auctions, and play in Age of Steam leads to a far more competitive play experience. I love the competition in Age of Steam that isn't found in Railroad Tycoon.

Wow, this game has a lot going for it!  I love the track building and the goods delivery and the alternate VPs and the Shares of Stock and the nice bits.

I am a little dismayed by the warping board problem, but I am hoping that this  is eventually cleared up.

Also, our first game took about 4 hours, which is a little long.  I am hoping that we can speed this up next time.  (Update:  Our second game took 3 1/2 hours.  A little faster.  There is some analysis paralysis here, and the game is easily slowed to a crawl if players do not think about the coming move while others are moving.)

Have now discovered the fun of stealing goods from your neighbors to prevent them from getting points.  An added layer of stuff to think about in this game!

Great game!

Wow! What a fantastic game! Kudos to Eagle for another winner (I love Bootleggers too). It plays just fine with 2 players (which is good, as it is often just my wife and myself playing), but is very challenging (in a good way) with 6 players. And the board looks wonderful, especially during the endgame.
 The only reason I rate this 9.5 and not 10 is because of the minor board warp issues.

I think this is the best railroad game put out so far on several counts - the components, the right amount of complexity / playability balance, and best big game for a group of diversely experienced players. I like the 18xx games for more detail and the AoS game and expansions are a good compromise, but I think Railroad Tycoon delivers the best value for a gathering of friends / family / gamers so far.

A harmadik nagy vonatos játék a sorban, amit ki tudtam próbálni. Steam, Age of Steam és most a Railroad. Gyönyörű hatalmas tábla, könnyedebb játékmenet, TTR-es lapmechanizmus. A legszebb kivitelű játék a három közül és a legkönnyebb is. A lapos mechanizmus nem csak színesíti a játékot, de néhol még segít is a bajbajutott játékosokon. A hitel kezelése is sokkal egyszerűbb. Minden adva van a jósághoz, de a végfeltétel sajnos nem jó. Ha kiürül x darab város, akkor van vége a játéknak. A jól álló játékos ezt könnyűszerrel siettetheti, míg a rosszabbul állók hiába próbálják késleltetni csak még nagyobb hátrányba kerülnek. Ez kétjátékos esetében sajnos nagyon sokat számít, bár egyértelműen nem kétjátékosra készült a társas. Ettől függetlenül szeretném majd még játszani, egyszer talán hatan is. Most egy 6-ossal indul, de emelek a ponton majd ha többen nem okoz gondot ez a végfeltétel dolog.

[2014-02-08]
Sikerült kipróbálni 5-en is. A végfeltétel siettetése most nem annyira jött ki, mert az egyik játékos annyira elhúzott, hogy tulajgondképpen bármikor végetérhetett volna számára nem volt esélyünk behozni. Most ez a dolog jött ki erősen, hogy már az első két kör után kialakult a játékbeli végsorrend. Bár a többi játékos között azért szorosabb lett a dolog, de akkor is látható volt, hogy nagyon büntet a játék. A másik dolog a gyönyörű térkép nem nagyon segít abban, hogy adott hexa pontosan melyik térképtípushoz tartozik, igaz ebben az elején meg lehet közösen állapodni, hogy később ne legyen belőle vita. Egyértelműen ez a játék tetszik az ugyanolyan típusúak közül a legkevésbé, de nem csökkentek a pontján.

This isn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.  It really does get a bad rap.  There is nothing wrong with this game, but contrary to that there is nothing really all that great to it either.  It is fine if you want to veg out and just move pieces around on autopilot.  This is more like playing a dungeon crawl game (where you just work mindlessly toward leveling up) or a civ building game (where you observe from a distance the "empire" you are building).

That said: 
The turn order auction is either irritating or a waste of time depending on the situation. 
The map is too big to be competitive on. 
There is a ton of wasted space and useless cities. 
The western expansion is silly as it is never worth it to ship two reds, two spaces when you are invariably going to have a three or four train by the time that they are relevant. 
By not scoring points based on what track you build, your strategy is constrained by the cards you draw in the beginning and what may potentially work for you from the draft. The length of the game just isn't warranted by how little you have to think or pay attention to it.  
Decisions are easy; timing is more a key, but even then there isn't much competition so it isn't that much of a concern. 
The economic system is too loosey goosey, there is never a pinch on money. 
Components interfere with the playability as the colors of the cities get covered by the pieces. 
River rules are needlessly confusing (just make the damn hex more expensive) and there isn't the same level of blocking being that it doesn't cost to replace track with complex crossings.

I'm not sure why I would ever play this again over AoS or a quicker 18xx game as it is just as long and not nearly as rewarding.  Of course, this works well enough that I would play it as an option not to play a worse game.

I've enjoyed this game, although it seems that as the game unfolds, and you upgrade to more powerful locomotive engines, the game starts to explode into an infinity of capability and we have to just shut it down.   We rarely see the game end because of the "empty town" limit being reached.  It's always that there are huge mega-tracks being erected all over the Board and it just gets ridiculous.   Maybe I'm playing it wrong.   Regardless, it's still fun so I rate it highly.

I don't play this game regularly enough. Consequently, I seem to make the same mistakes in each game I play - start by delivering short routes for some income, then don't upgrade enough and plan for longer deliveries for more points. Still, I generally enjoy the experience (lack of winning excepted).

I like trains a lot.  This game, not so much, and I even won in my first play!  I love the large board and all the pretty components, and the first few turns are good, when you have to decide on your timing to either build track or increase your income.  But after that, it drags on and on, in mindless monotony, as you scan the board trying to eke out a little more efficiency so that you can stay ahead.  There are so many better games out there for the time investment.  What I realize now is that I wish that someone could cross the cool track-laying mechanic of this game with the interesting and fast economic decisions in Chicago Express.

RATING: 6
This is clearly a simplified, streamlined version of Age of Steam. On a freakishly large board. Really, it's freaking huge - and for no good reason! But it's the same railroad-building, cube delivering game. Track has no value other than for delivery (no VP at end). The money is not nearly as tight (can issue stock shares whenever you want; income increases very quickly so you become profitable earlier; you're only auctioning for first place -- since no one else pays, there's more cash in the game ... sit to the left of the big spender if you can!). Also, there is much more randomness because of the cards: tycoon cards give everyone a different goal for bonus points at the end and the operation cards that come up every round can be a real gift sometimes. During the game you build networks of track connecting cities, and deliver cubes over track (hopefully mostly your own) segments to increase your VP. Each VP is associated with a per-turn income, that initially goes up (max income $24K, I think) then goes down (so with 100VP, for example, your income is only $9). Every turn you must pay expenses: price of tracks built, actions taken, and shares previously issued (shares are with you till game end). The game ends when x (depends on number of players) towns/cities have been depleted of their cubes. Then you lose 1VP/share issued. Most VP wins.

Cool bits, but the board is WAY too big (hard to place on table, hard to play on 'cause of difficulty reaching, seemingly lots of room for expansion) and there's too much randomness in the cards. Go with Age of Steam!

I actually owned the original "Railroad Tycoon" edition of this game. I liked it but found a few of the mechanics a bit clunky and the game board was just too large to make it convenient to pull out and set up. I think Steam would be a much better choice, also by the same designer.

RATING: 7.5
A large and expansive game.  Haven't played this game half as much as I would have liked.  Certainly seems to be a bias towards the East Coast where things get pretty tight.  Great game that takes up a lot of real-estate.  Now sold to make way for another game.  Sad to see it go, but if it just isn't hitting the table and with no opponents on the horizon, it's better in the hands of someone who is gonna play it.

I'm not a big fan of train games, but I had high hopes for Railroad Tycoon -- I won't necessarily say I was dissapointed, but I wasn't terribly impressed, either.  Specifically, I would have liked to see more interaction with a tighter, tenser race for territory outside of the North East.  If it were a shorter game I'd likely rate it closer to a 7.5 or an 8, but I feel that for the game I'm getting it's a bit on the lengthy side.  In the right mood, however, I'm game -- perhaps my general malaise towards trains further colours my rating!

Played with four and we were all new to the game.  The rules are fairly simple, the board looks magnificent, and, most of all, it is fun!  Despite the simple rules, there are many difficult choices and interesting decisions, both short-term and long-term.  I've played Age of Steam a few times and RRT looks better, is simpler to learn, and more fun.

with Railways of Europe - The first time I tried this I didn't quite get it.  I don't know why but maybe we played wrong.  Then I played this again, as Rails of Europe, during a game night and it was outstanding.  I got my butt kicked because I didn't know strategy and made mistakes early on.  But whenever a game makes you reflect on your mistakes and leave you wanting more plays gets an A+ in my book. Played a simplified ruleset of Railways of Europe with the family and most everyone liked it.  Eager to play this again with them using the full ruleset.  The more I play this game the more I like it.

Only played the Mexico map introductory version with two players. 
Components are awesome. I still don't like the scoring board (we always have to complaint about something!) but everything else is absolutely lovely: money, bonds, trains, locomotive cards... everything!

The basic game is very basic indeed but the idea of having a great component game to use with lots of expansion boards is very good. After playing this basic version I'm very interested in getting into a more hardcore game using the railroad baron expansion by M. Wallace.

Played a six player game in the US map without the cards. I liked it. It's really over produced although with some ridiculous flaws like for example the absence of a proper score marker! A wooden cube would be a tremendous idea! Not too long and as far as I could appreciate a good game for newbies.

There are games I enjoy more for the theme, and others I enjoy more for the mechanics; this one is a mechanics winner. Trains don't interest me one bit but planning and building your routes and trying to score high when delivering the goods is something I really enjoy. There is a "Ticket to Ride" vibe with much more going on and actually more control for the player. I really need to get a route game into my collection, that's how much I enjoy that mechanic.
I would be interested to see some of the of the other maps, too.

This is Age of Steam the Family Game, which is really to say, it's basically nothing like Age of Steam except for the delivery of cubes and route building, but everything else is different. But, this place serves a purpose, if you enjoy train games like I do but you know the opportunity for Age of Steam, 18XX, or any Winsome is basically a rare chance, this is a game that you can easily play with others.

Note: I played the Railroad Tycoon version and it didn't have all the long-distance routes listed at the beginning and I had no idea what they all were and I lucked into two of them when the cards turned. A luck factor I don't like but a luck factor that I hear was fixed, so that's good.

My kinda game. Lovely to look at, bigggg map, simple rules, deep game play, trains.  Mrs Sorp likes it which is just gravy. I used to love playing the computer version and this conversion sits well with the spirit of the original. Maybe if Age of Steam is ever reprinted i'll find an even better rail game (edit AoS a better game,however i don't feel out of of my comfort zone with RRT.) think the Op cards are flawed, next time will take out or start on the board ala Rails of europe....and so arethe baron cards. Op cards / Baron Cards are too random. Wonder if a variant which takes some role selction from AoS (without the brutality of the  auction and expenses) would work.

Railways of the World is the third, and by far the most beautiful, implementation of the Steam series (following Age of Steam and Steam). In this game, each player is running his or her own train company and are building railroads in order to connect different cities and, by doing so, start delivering goods between these cities in exchange for money and victory points. While it is a neat game, it also feels like a somewhat stripped down version of Steam.

Don't let the ugly box art deter you from purchasing this great game. 

It is easy to set up and learn. Lots of fun. Scales well from 2-4 (haven't tried more than that yet.) Mexico is the better board for 2 players--Eastern US is too open.

Even my 8 and 10 year-old children were able to learn without difficulty.

This is a pretty good design.  After playing many games of this and playing several game sof Steam. I think I am pretty darn torn between the two.  I do not like the starting cards for this, it seems to give the starting player too big of an advnatage, sure you can make them pay in the auction. but they both get the income boost and they get to deliver the first cube bonus.  

I do like the way the VP's interact with the income track as opposed to Steam, where you have to choose when to start going for VP's. Sure it is an interesting choice but it is gamey.

Seemingly in the same family as crayon rail games or power grid, this is much more appealing. The board and pieces are part of the attraction, but the economic system is the most distinctive part of the play. To finance the construction that will allow you to earn income, you must first put yourself in debt.

One of my favorite games.  This is better than Age of Steam because it removes some of the unnecessary complexity while remaining heavy enough that even 18XX nuts like myself can still play it and feel like it has meaningful decisions.  The fact that two maps are included which are recommended for different numbers of players helps the game immensely as many games seem to haphazardly alter the board with a smaller number of players without much success.

It's not a 10 because I could see myself getting tired of it after a dozen plays, but for now I truly love it.

I wish the board was a bit smaller and lacked color problems, and was layed out slightly differently so that one section could be used more intuitively for 2-player sessions.

RATING: 8
This is lighter and more "friendly" fare than AoS, and given the choice between the two, I'd go with AoS--luckily I don't have to choose :)  The rules are short, but not particularly clear, so make sure you check out the FAQ before play if you want to get everything as intended. 

There's no doubt the game is GORGEOUS, but it's also GINORMOUS!  It takes up the entirety of our dining table--and really the score track could be put off on a credenza, or side table. But the good part is there's very little that has to sit in front of a player--just their money and loans.  Even their trains could be kept separate, since the number you have left is not really relevant at any time.  The main difficulty comes in trying to see the whole map--nearly impossible while sitting down, you'll probably have to get up often to look for city names and whatnot until you're family with the abstracted geography on the board.

This is a much more forgiving game than AoS, and requires less razor-accurate accounting to play optimally--you can get by much better with non-optimal loans (too few OR too many) and still stay competitive.  This is both good and bad.  On the good side it definitely opens the way for more variation in strategies.  On the bad side, it definitely feels less intense.  The auction mechanic is very watered down, as its entirely just for turn order--which plays a part in AoS, but the auction for role makes AoS far more aggressively competitve.

All in all, I'd recommend it if you have the shelf space for a large box, and the table size for a giant map, but if you lack either and play in a group that can handle the intense competition, AoS will be much more fun.

Less gamer friends/family like Amanda & my mom would enjoy a game like Railroad Tycoon more than Age of Steam so when a Coolstuff local was selling it along with both expansions for a nice price I went ahead and bit.

No, this isn't the epic struggle of AoS, because it's not meant to be.

Here we have yet another jaw-dropping contribution from Eagle Games.  I must confess, I love those over-produced games.  It's no wonder Eagle went out of business, but is this one ever a beautiful sight to behold!  And more importantly, I finally own a train game that is a lot of fun to play (hopefully I can now avoid the mind-numbing tedium that is "Ticket To Ride").  They have managed to create an interesting game that has several fun elements without making it at all complicated to learn or play.  It is beautiful and it is brilliant, and although I personally don't have any problems with the city colours, I can't give it a perfect score for game design due to that frustratingly warped board.  This, and "Conquest of the Empire", are the reasons that I caved in and finally purchased a large sheet of plexi-glass.  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8.5/10

[1 play] Initial reaction rating.  So of course the natural thing to do is to compare this game with Age of Steam.  Well having played this only once, and AoS twice I really have not made up my mind which is better.  I *think* I might slightly favor AoS but that could easily change if I played the games more.  I do like the nice BIG map in Railroad Tycoon.  In general I am a big fan of railroad games, this one has plenty of good thinking and planning.  I certainly like to play this game again.  The one thing that bugged me about the game was the special cards that gave you points for connecting some cities or doing some delivery.  Maybe I could have focused on them better right at the start when the inital set of them came out, but during the game I didn't get a single one of them and other players got a lot of them.  A new one would come out and say to do something, and some player would be totally setup to do that very thing and poof there is five points for them.  Just seemed like a luck factor I could have done without.  Maybe if I played it more and worked harder to get some of the initial ones, or realized what ones are in the deck and how to setup to get them better I would not mind them as much, I don't know.

[Eagle Games 2005 edition] {Railroad, economic; set collection, secret-goal, pick-up-and-delivery; optimal 5p} Railroad Tycoon is a good pick-up-and-delivery game.  It is easy to learn and teach.  It is interactive and fun. And, it supports both strategic and tactical options.  It is easier to master than Age of Steam and to control cash flow.  The Railroad operation cards add fun and surprises to the game and they increase the importance of player order bidding.  I own both Age of Steam and Railroad Tycoon.  Both are excellent games.  Personally, I prefer Age of Steam.  But I will pick Railroad Tycoon for general friends.

The board is horribly large, which makes the game only fun and exciting with more people, though it increases downtime.

The components are nicely produced, somewhat over-produced.  However, it would be clumsy to handle the three-part board with a small table.

I enjoyed playing this game. There is a bit more going on than in e.g. Ticket to Ride. The board is huge, but they have not used the space very well and the design could be clearer.

UPDATE 2: My favorite [i]multiplayer[/i] game ever. Surpassed by Ambush! as my #1.

Once I'd got over feeling too geeky buying a boardgame ..... about ..... trains ..... I realised that what I had was a very good game that delivers the feeling of building a rail empire whilst staving off the presssures of shareholders. Fantastic, epic game. I can even love what others consider to be it's faults - the Tycoon cards and the oversized board. Really glad I own this.

RATING: 6
User-friendly and looks great, with some chaotic swings via the card additions. The map is unbalanced however, with the Northeast being prime real estate and the Southwest being a vast wasteland.

RAILWAY TYCOON improved by RAILWAYS OF THE WORLD (1st print) which itself is improved by RAILWAYS OF THE WORLD (2nd). With a 3rd printing about to hit the shelves, that's a fine testimony to this engaging game.

It's annoying that there is a simple screw-up or two in each and every release. More attention-to-detail from Eagle would be greatly appreciated in order to avoid these problems.

Overall, this takes a (far) back seat to 18xx and Age of Steam. I don't think our group has any interest in playing this series again.

Wow!  I thought I wouldn't like it.  I figured that they shouldn't mess with Age of Steam.  I was wrong!  In some ways this is actually better. It's certainly more appropriate for casual gamers.  There are some downtime issues and it's very long and of course there's the board warping problem that others have complained about (ick).  But otherwise this is a supurb reworking of Age of Steam and well worth playing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My initial impression is Age of Steam with many of the hard decisions & painful consequences removed and replaced by a "pimp my game" mentality leading to much poorer ergonomics. Since I've only played it once, seating position may be a big factor. I sat on the Western side. Next time I'll try to sit on the East and see how that half of the game plays.

On the other hand, my 13yo son thought the game was great, prefering it to Volldampf or Age of Steam. The follies of youth, eh?

[update: I'd rate the unofficial California expansion an 8]

Easily one of my favorite games in the collection.  As you expand your railroad empire, the board gets more and more exciting and seeing the masterpiece you've created when you're done is always visually stunning.  Plays great the standard way and the stock market version.

I own the Europe board, the England & Wales board, the Western U.S. board, and the Railways Through Time board(s).

Good, but i'm not sure it's exactly for me.  Leaves a lot of AP on each turn.  For a pick-up and deliver game, it is was won 2 of 3 times by building the major connection lines rather than actually picking up and delivering.  Maybe it's an expectations thing more than a game play thing, but I feel like there are just other games I would rather play.

RATING: 8
Over-produced pick up and deliver railway themed game. The mechanics are drawn from a very strong source, that being 'Age of Steam, where players have to construct tracks running between different towns and cities of differing colours. These settlements contain coloured cubes that have then to be transported to towns/cities that match their colour. The further a cube is transported, the more income a player earns, which is mainly how victory is determined. The production qualities are of the highest order and the game can play quite differently each time depending on the initial placement of the coloured cubes, thereby making this a stand-out game for fans of railway games. There is however a drop-off in strategic depth from the original 'AoS', which leads to it feeling slightly light on meaningful decision making.

Seemed like an OK game. The huge board made it quite hard to keep track of everything going on; and it seemed to lack any real player_vs_player tension, even during bidding.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Played 10+ times.  The board is big and pretty.  I like the tension between having all your options available but only being able to do them one at a time. The game play is similar to AoS but more forgiving.  The first player auction is less tense and there is generally only a couple times in the game when going first is important to you. I like how the cards make the game a bit different each time and how they affect the game.  I also like the cube production is less random than Age of Steam.  Conclusion: This game is easier to introduce people to than Age of Steam, but lacks the bite that makes AoS my favorite game. Note: you need to be careful of the NW; lots of points available for cheap. 2008/11/17

Eagle strike back! The huge map let players follow individual strategy with low interaction. Bidding phase is important only when there are many players and strong cards (really difficult to manage with a useless graphic). Components rich and useless (trains, crossroad signals, etc)! I respect different and positive comments on this game, but this one for me is really a shame! Take a look to the "essential" Age of Steam, if you prefer good but heavier games.

I love this game. It´s my favourite (non – war) strategy game. I love it´s clean design, it´s easy to learn but hard to master rules. The nearly no luck all skill gameplay pared with just the right amount of randomness and swingy situations (cards and random cubes you may try to pull from the back).

The only downside of the game is that I get very mixed responses from the players I play it with. Ranging from: “there is nearly no interaction and it is a very solo-style game” too “I found it too tense and too competitive, I got really upset when someone spoiled my optimisation plan”. So that I have a kind of hard time to bring it to the table and establish a regular group.

A nice game.  It works for mid-level gamers and heavier gamers.  The size of the board makes it difficult sometimes to get a good feel of all that is going on which can impact your play.  But certainly worth what I paid for it.  Hopefully I can eventually get a replacement for the warping board.

03-Nov-08: What a masterpiece! The rules look daunting at first, along with the humongous board, but once it gets going, the game pace traveled along fairly quickly. We played 2-player first without the auctions, just to familiarise ourselves with the rules. And then we played with the auctions, and everything clicked. Even with 2, auctions were tense because we both wanted to go first and Nab the Important Operations Card, or Build that Crucial Track. We played with the middle board the second time round, and we agreed that it wasn't as exciting as the full board because of all the cities that are not on the board but are stated in the Operations Cards.

It's different enough from AoS to make it worth owning both. The bid-for-start-player-and-then-go-clockwise mechanism combined with no cards to take with the bid causes the bidding to be very low and unexciting. Only when two people are trying to beat each other to some connection will it be anything more. Either needs to just have the start player pass or the AoS order-based-on-bid mechanism needs to be used, I think. I like the new mechanisms for getting through the mountains makes you build weird turns to reduce costs like you do in the computer game. It felt like the game was ending too early, but maybe that'll change with experience. Doesn't seem like anyone would end up getting to a 8 engine and use it before the end of the game.

This is an enjoyable and beautiful spin-off of Age of Steam.  The board is absolutely huge, which necessitates a large playing surface with a lot of elbow room so players can stand up and wander to the other side of the board.

This was my first railroad game, having only played Ticket to Ride, and I enjoyed it.  The whole game is much more thematic than TTR.  The event cards were cool, but it's weird how there are 3 per player at the beginning, then only one new card each turn.  There was a mad frenzy at the start, but then they had minimal impact.  I liked the income track, particularly how income peaks in the middle and then decreases.

Overall, I liked the game.  I enjoyed the route building, shipping, variable player powers (they were minor), and bonus points for select routes.  My only minor complaint was the shortage of event cards.  I'm looking forward to trying more rail games.

Our group of experienced AoS players have abandoned that venerable forebear for Tycoon. It's not so much that Tycoon is a better game, but rather that we get lots more enjoyment of of Tycoon while still getting that great feeling of having invested in a rail network that bears fruit in the endgame. No warping problems with the boards here in San Francisco.

Europe is a blast too - one of our group printed the map on a big HP plotter in full color and it's working great.

I can see why people like this game system so much. It's clever, balanced, deep, and takes good planning and solid execution to play. For me, though, it's a bit too dry, and route-building and pick-up-and-deliver games just aren't my favorite. I'll gladly play this once or twice a year if requested, but that's about it. While recognizing the skill it takes to play this well (usually a characteristic that scores big with me), I just don't find Railways of the World terribly fun or satisfying.

Holding off on rating for now as I've only played 2 two-player games, both with the Mexico map.  The first game was a challenge to figure out the balance between going broke and taking too many bonds.  We both figured it out by the second game.  I think this will be fun with more players and more interaction.  With two on Mexico, we rarely crossed paths.  I think this has a lot of potential and I'm looking forward to trying it with more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Played with the Eastern U.S. map (4 players), with Mexico (3 players) and with Europe (3 players). All three maps seem to play differently in terms of how many bonds each player must get and how much interaction there is. I'm really enjoying the system now and hope to get several more plays in. I'm a bit disappointed about the color mismatch between purple/blue cubes and the purple/blue spaces on the board, but players will eventually get used to it or I will get some pink cubes to replace the purple ones when playing with the Mexico and Eastern U.S. maps. Very brain burny game which has some pretty good interaction.

Pros: Strategic, not dependent on many random elements, interesting debt mechanic. The setup of the cargo is random, which gives a little bit of a dynamic setup.

A very interesting train game in which players are either elbowing each other for the lucrative but congested routes or else trying to find a clever exploit in the relatively ignored sections of the map.

It's also a very interesting economic game in that players have to balance spending to get first crack at the route they want while not getting too far into debt.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
In the beginning of the game there was a lot of tension. There were many interesting choices to be made with potentially lots of conflicting interests. But as the game progressed and everyone established his railway system, the game became really exceedingly static around mid-game, when everyone just delivered, delivered and once again: delivered! No one wanted to found a city or try anything else. One of the reasons it became this static is that drawing only one card after each round isn't nearly enough. In the beginning everyone bid on the starting player in order to be the first one to get access to the best connections or the best cards. As mentioned above later on there was no dire need to further expand the railway system and there were no cards or just one that just wasn't worthwhile. 
Not that my memory of Age of steam is very vivid, but from what I recall I think this one is better by a landslide.

A very big improvement over Steam. Everything has been streamlined in a good way, and there are new elements that just make the game better (the cards, secret goals). This usually isn't my kind of game, but I would play this one again.

My only complaint is that the game is a little longer than I would like. It seems like with all of the streamlining they could have found a way to knock the play time down to around 2 hours. As it is now, it seems like games will regularly go more than 3 hours.

Update: I've played this a ton and the rating is a 10. I love that the game really does scale well from 2-6, can accommodate a wide variety of gamers (casual to serious) and gives a sense of epic-ness in a relatively short time.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1

A perfect mix of beauty, meatiness, and fun.  All in a game that I can actually get to the table with casual gamers.  

Rails of Europe only improves the game.

Update: Rating stays the same as I've gotten to play more.  I can see this actually being a 10 someday.

Update:  The above was written about Railroad Tycoon but applies here as well.

The reason I traded RT for RotW was because I wanted everything to match and to be able to play East and West maps together.  Also the colors were fixed. 

This is actually a 10 now.  I love pick-up-and-deliver and this game is very accesible to even non-gamers.

What great fun building your railroad line across the pristine continent!  The economics in this game are simplified from some of the heavier railroad games, but the flavor and excruciating decision making is not lost.  The railroad operation cards and tycoon cards add some great variability to the game, and the starting location of production goods could make for vastly different games each time.  All in all, a stellar production that keeps your interest the whole way through.

More forgiving than [gameid=4098], and though that's generally not a compliment, it's a nice alternative for those times that you don't want the tension associated with AoS.  Player count creates balance issues with the base map, as there are so many opportunities in the northeast.  It's best to play with 5 or 6 to encourage plenty of competition there, making other areas more attractive.  Both [gameid=30450] and [gameid=42964] have more balanced maps.

[02-15-09:Evaluation is based on both base game and Rails of Europe.]  After 3 plays: I love this game.  I've held off rating this so far because I'm waiting to play it more to see where the rating will settle.  It's a big, beefy box, with very tactile components.  I love the scale of the maps--the base game is huge and expansive and the Europe map still feels appropriately so.  Each game develops a narrative arc as you fight over territory, plot your own particular strategy, and determine the strengths of your empire--all while navigating transitions from broke start-up to burgeoning business to bloated and increasingly inefficient rail company.  I get a real sense of expansion and accomplishment from the game.  

I can see how Age of Steam would be more economically brutal, more cutthroat, more mathy, but at this point I honestly don't care, as this game strikes a great balance between playability and strategy that is very important for my gaming partners.

RATING: 7
Much looser and more sprawling than AoS, much more forgiving, a lot more money around in the endgame, many fewer choices. I'll play if it's being played, but I can't see myself suggesting it if AoS is available.

This is very nearly a perfectly designed game.  You can teach the rules in 5 minutes to a complete gaming noobie.  I love that you just take one action at a time, because the downtime is almost nothing.  There is no need to ever reference the rules, yet there is a load of strategy involved.

I think that's the true measure of a great game for me, if its learned easily and you can literally use the rulebook as kindling after one read, and still have a deep experience with a solid amount of strategy.  That's gaming at it's best.  

Only dings on the base set is that some major lines don't come out which does not allow you to play the long game, and that the NE corridor is very very powerful.  Other maps fix both of these minor things too.

Played at the Eagle Games booth at GenCon. Really slick game that I can't wait to be released. We've played a lot of Age of Steam over the last few years, and while the core of the game is similar, these two games are different enough that they both can be enjoyed in their own right. The board is _huge_ and very spread out. Due to the city placement and they way resoursces work in the early game it's pretty obvious that you're supposed to start nearer to the east coast, and then expand to the west. Only three red cities makes them very valuable goods to ship, and competition for short connections was fierce at times. Differs from AoS in that bidding is for start player, and play then follows in clockwise order. Also, their are no role selections to be made, you simply take an action from a list of choices (play track, ship goods, urbanize, upgrade train, etc.) and take three actions per turn. Stocks still grant $5, and can be taken at any time, and after you take income (indicated on the scoring track) you pay 1 for each stock issued. Their are also special victory point cards delt out at the start of the game, for things like; issuing the least shares, having the longest consecutive line, having the largest locomotive, and so forth. There is also a special deck of action cards that alow for special point bonuses, extra track building, and so forth, but we didn't use these for the demo. Different, but similar, and I had a blast playing.

An interesting eurogame that forces you into thinking like a capitalist! I'm not inspired by train-themed games, but this one flows well.

Some unecessary luck involved (in some of the random cards), but not enough to spoil the game. My only real complain is that player competition is on the bad side of player interaction - compete with one player, and the others get ahead. So this game is as much about drawing less attention than your competitors, as about having a good strategy.

The combination of an uninspiring theme and "bad" interaction mechanics means that this game is really not for me.

Friendlier, lighter game in the Age of Steam family.  While I do tend to prefer my train/stock games heavier and more brutal, this one definitely has its place.  I clearly don't get this game, though as I seem to finish middle to back of the pack.

Having played all three TTR variants as well as Union Pacific, this was a fun and interesting change of pace. I'd like to play a few more times now that I've gotten a feel for the gameplay. I can see two specific strategies: short & quick points throughout the entire game VS. high-debt, long-runs, and high point in the late game. I'd like to find some more subtle approaches.

Its a very good game, I will likely suggest and never turn down a game.  Enjoyed it so much, I went out and purchased Age of Steam within the same week.  The only negative about this game, is its not as challenging or skillfull as Age of Steam  and has comparable length and ruleset.  I don't know how to rank it however, it was fun, I enjoyed it, but I'd go to Age of Steam over this every time.  I am unlikely to ever play this again.

I came to Railroad Tycoon after having played Age of Steam over 30 times. I had some trepidation because of the warnings that other Age of Steam fans had given me about the significant inferiority of Railroad Tycoon. As a result, I was pleasantly surprised by Railroad Tycoon. I didn't like it quite as much as Age of Steam, but when it comes to Age of Steam, Railroad Tycoon, and now Steam, they're really all so much more similar than I think most people admit. I have a feeling most people just prefer the game among this trio that they happened to play first since it's most familiar, at least that's the case with me. I enjoy playing the other offshoots since they're basically just like variants and I don't see any reason to pick a single favorite that you need to stick with to the exclusion of the others. The essence of all three is the same and I'll happily play any of them just about any time.

A solid route-building game. It has plenty of eye-candy for those that want this in their games: the trains and water stations sure look good on the board. The cards and board are also very well done.

The game isn't as heavy as a 18XX title, not even close. It involves more pick-and-deliver and route building (including upgrading trains), and no shares buying and selling.

All works well. There are plenty of possibilities throughout the game, including gaining acess to some neat cards (the railroad operation).

Overall, a good game in an enormous box.

Definitely remains my top game. I love everything about the gameplay of this game.

I will admit it has many production flaws...overproduced plastic, the board warps, the hugeness of it yet the silly score track and lack of areas to put cards/stuff. the round markers on the board divide kills me. the colors.

And yet! None of those things, though they seem numerous, lessen my enjoyment of actually playing the game. I think I am obsessed a little with pick up and deliver mechanics and I can't explain why. All I know is I love building my little system, I love that everything is done with an eye on the competition, I love that I can try new things each time as the mix of cubes and cards opens up so many options at the start and even throughout the game you can try new directions or discover a lucrative delivery you really had no idea about. Will always want to play.

Knocking this down a notch only because Rails of Europe fixes the little tiny issues enough to make the original game...well, almost unnecessary!

My first thought: Oh, what's that, AoS light...? I've played it several times since and I'm lucky to have a copy for my collection now. Why I've changed my mind? Recently some of my board game group became parents and now they are suffering from a lack of time. Also, we sometimes have guests in our group who normally are casual players. Playing AoS means you need time and you need to enjoy a very challanging game. So AoS was no option... Railroad Tycoon on the other hand is a very enjoyable game. It's challanging enough to be of interest for gamers and easy enough to get casual gamers and "new parents" involved. The games components are lovely. The only question mark might be the huge board. On my first  Railroad Tycoon evening the table available wasn't spacious enough so we played on the floor. Railroad Tycoon definitely is on the Thumbs Up side.

Revisit the early days of the Age of Steam as you begin with a locomotive (the venerable John Bull, the first locomotive to run in North America) and a vision (your Tycoon "mission" card).

Connect New York to Chicago, earn the most money, develop bigger and faster locomotives and maybe even span North America and build the Transcontinental Railway!

I suspect this will be a "more the merrier" playing best with 5 or 6, but we'll see...

I have never played Age of Steam but this game is certainly tense enough. The scores in the end were so close and tight that we were basically a few points within each other. The game is certainly unforgiving. We realized that one move can make or break the game. However, the options were really varied and highly unpredictable.I was personally finding more routes as the game progressed and these were the routes that I didn't "see" before. I find that invigorating and definitely exciting.

A really well-designed game that should be in my collection for many more years to come.

O.K.  I'm a little relieved.  This isn't Railroad Tycoon.  With the loose economy, the spacious board, and the bonus goals, it doesn't feel anymore like Age of Stream than something like Silverton.  Without constant fear of destitution, it's just not Age or Steam.It's still a good game, and more likely to get played.  We have one player who hasn't had good luck with train games, and his luck in Age of Steam was par for the course.  He might be OK with this one.

Very good rail game. Yes, it can be described as Age of Steam lite. However, I look at it as a different game with the same theme. RRT is definiterly less cut-throat. The economics are much milder and bankruptcy is no where in sight after the first few turns. The Operation and Tycoon cards add more theme to the game at the cost of a little more randomness. Allowing equal 'roles' and action opportunities adds more to the theme and removes the abstract feel of Age of Steam. RRT is a great game, suitable for family AND gamers.

UPDATE - After more plays I am more and more impressed with this game. Yes, there is a bias to the Northeast. However, there is a depth in this game and the theme runs so nicely with the gameplay that its a great game. As such I've upped my rating from the original 8.5 to 9.5.

18XX unfortunately proved to be too heavy for the group, so this is our train game for now. It really takes up a huge amount of table space for a non-wargame.

Once the game is set up, it is easy to become a victim of information overload. You try to process the position of cubes and where they can be delivered, estimating where different possible networks would peak (at 3-deliveries? 4? 5? 6?), their cost, possible competition and bottlenecks, and it becomes quite a lot to take in...

Has become a popular game, and at some point I may look at getting the eastern US map.

Here's how you take an elegant, streamlined design and add a bunch of mediocrity on top of it, bogging down the core gameplay with mediocrity.  For example, the hidden goals each player get simply make the game worse.

Still an enjoyable enough game, but I see little reason to play or suggest this over Steam.

Played once.  Very good game, one I'd choose to play over AoS just because the large board is so much easier to comprehend.  The consequent drawback, and the reason I'm unlikely to buy it, being the size of box required to hold the board and bits.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I really love the board aspect of this game, how it forms, the tactics and strategies as the routes spread across the land mass.   It played much longer than I expected, could benefit from some updated graphic design.  Also not a huge fan of the bid to start each round, just slows things down more than I'd like, and makes things a bit extra stressful.

RATING: 7
Although probably not as strategic, this game is more fun to me than Age of Steam, mainly due to the lack of restrictions in taking shares (which can cost you the game in Age of Steam). It's quite a bit of fun stealing cubes from others and hoping people don't come into your territory.

Great game.  Train minis are great, the "empty city" tokens are varied and look sharp.  My only problem is that the game's wood tokens do not match the board's colour.  It's a problem.  I have fixed the problem by obtaining different coloured cubes to match the board.

I've played 2 times, and the light bulb is starting to flicker now, but hasn't quite fully come on just yet for me.  I've had a blast both times, but I wasn't in the running, and felt like I lost in round 1 (and also every subsequent round).  This game definitely rewards you if you know what you're doing.  I think.  I wouldn't really know, though.  It's a grand game, with grand components.

Initial impression: Too long, too much downtime, and too expensive.  I've played about 10 different railroad games, and this is probably my least favorite.  It may be a good buy for those who feel like they have too much table space, and need a game to fill it all.

Edit: After playing with the RotW rules, I've changed my mind here.  This is an excellent game, and now I'm an owner :)

The playing style and tactics seemed to have very little effect on the outcome. What did effect the outcome was being alone in some part of the board. The one who had least interaction with the rest won while the rest were at about the same score regardles of game strategy. Also the possibility to sabotage others track building so easily drops this game into the average/bad games category. Might need some more plays but I'm fairly sure that my rating sticks.

RAILROAD TYCOON DEVELOPMENT: A Play in One Act

FRED: Let's take Age of Steam, but strip out all of the interesting parts and package it under a different name!

MARTIN: Er ... what did you want to take out, exactly?

FRED: The auctions.

MARTIN:  The ... the auctions?  But--

FRED: Well, specifically the turn order relating to the auction.  It seems like we could just make it so that whoever bids highest goes first, and then everyone takes their turn clockwise from that point.

MARTIN: Doesn't that defeat the pur--

FRED: But you know what?  When we played Age of Steam, we got frustrated that we had to wait until it was our turn to increase our locomotive.  Why not just set it so that people can buy a stronger locomotive whenever they have the money, even if it's not their turn?

MARTIN: What?

FRED: Plus, the board is too small!  We want to produce a board the size of Wyoming, and make sure that there's so much space on the board that nineteen people could play at the same time, and never interfere with each other!

MARTIN:  That's ... oh my god....

FRED: And you know, Age of Steam needs CARDS, don't you think?  We could have a deck of cards where people could earn points for special goals, that no one else knows about, preventing anyone from knowingly keeping you from those goals?

MARTIN: The whole point of Age of Steam is to limit the amount of unknown information!

FRED: We know!  It sucks, doesn't it?  We want to make Age of Steam, just without any tension whatsoever!

Fun, accessible and beautiful. I like the balance of luck and skill. Production values are very good. It's neat that the game includes a larger map for 4-6 players (eastern United States) and a smaller map for 2-3 players (Mexico); this makes the game hit the table more often. The 2nd printing of RoTW also includes cards for the Mexico map, as well as matching and corrected cube and city colours and finally a very good plastic insert. Make sure you get the 2nd printing. I've yet to experience that the game overstays its welcome, so playing time is more or less just right. Make sure to get either Railways of Europe or Railways of England & Wales expansions. I'm not a fan of the large map included with Railways of the World. The two aforementioned expansions makes this game a 9. Highly recommended!

Less down time than Age Of Steam, more wide-open board, and a more forgiving economic system makes this more accessible than it's parent-game, Age Of Steam. I think Railroad Tycoon could prove more enjoyable, but I have a sneaking suspicion Age Of Steam is still the "better game" from a design point of view (those who take issue with some of the faults in Age Of Steam--the shaky endgame, the widely variable value of actions--will find similar problems with Railroad Tycoon; the problems haven't been fixed, just transmuted).

Railways of the World almost certainly represents the medium-weight railroad game at its best, being at the end of the process of evolutionary curve of development that began already before Age of Steam. It can be considered as the new-and-improved Railroad Tycoon Mark II, and effectively renders the original Railroad Tycoon game obsolete. It's already in the BGG Top 100, and will certainly rise above Railroad Tycoon in the rankings when it gets the same number of ratings, since its average rating is considerably higher.

This is the new edition of Railroad Tycoon.

Railways of the World is one of my favorite games. In my eyes, it hits an almost perfect ratio of complexity to fun. There are plenty of opportunities for interesting decision making, multiple strategies to pursue and just enough tension to make it exciting. It also has gorgeous components that do an outstanding job of bringing the game to life. Win or lose, it's enjoyable just to watch your rail empire grow and spread across the continent. It's also neat to watch the empty city markers start to spring up around the board as the game wraps up. It gives the game an epic feel, as if you just played through a hundred years of history. There's nothing quite like it.

I'm also impressed with the milage the designers got out of such a simple rule set. It literally takes about 10 minutes to cover the basics, yet the mechanics feel so much deeper and complex than their simple framework. I also love the fact that everyone starts with zero money. From turn one, you're in debt. That alone makes most people approach the economics of this game from a bit outside their comfort zone.

It's a brilliant game and will be a fixture in my Top 10 for a long time to come.

Board warpage does happen. It can be fixed, but be careful. Otherwise, this is more appealing to those I actually play games with than Age of Steam ever was. Still, the perfect incarnation would integrate some auction/role elements and the cards.

The southwest is just utterly ridiculous, and the cards and really the game overall feels like it was designed by a committee that didn't ever meet up. So much unrealized potential.

Held out for the reprint of this version with the corrected colors and more Baron cards, along with a bunch of other minor improvements.  This is an excellent pick up and deliver game with plenty of expansions to keep things fresh when you get tired of what's in the box (which is a lot).  A fun game where you don't get bogged down into calculating stock values and income dividends on a calculator and you don't have to speculate on the value of a line.  This is the one fun rail game to start with and expand your horizons from here.

Normally, I don't like games that are based on PC games but this one has my railroading-nut interest piqued.

Finally got the chance to play this game (twice!) and I enjoyed it a great deal (even though I didn't do so well either time). I look forward to playing it more and to see if my rating climbs or drops. The one thing that I question is the Tycoon cards, which seem to be a bit unbalanced. Both games were won by Pullman and both games I failed as Vanderbilt. Additionally, with multiple "Least Stocks Issued" and "Most Cash" Tycoons, it could guarantee (if more than one are in play) that at least one person of each group can absolutely not meet their criteria. Still, it was a very fun game to lose. :)

Interesting game,  but a bit long.  The cube shipping for income/VP is a neat mechanic,  but feels slow-paced,  especially if you have lots of deliveries left to do and no one blocking you.  The blocking-style interaction that is there is pretty brutal and unforgiving (to the one trying to do the blocking),  and often feels a bit arbitrary - it's often difficult to block just for the sake of blocking (ie, not much blocking usually happens)

A couple more games - once on the new (Rails of Europe) map,  once again on the old one.   Definitely some pacing issues - the costs simply don't scale.   You're completely without money initially,  but by the end,  you can find yourself flush with cash and nothing reasonable to spend it (Western link is very rarely a reasonable proposition.).  That's probably a bit of player inefficiency,  and the fact that the auctions are only of mild importance - since it's "around from the winner" I don't think I ever bothered to spend much on the auction other than to bid up cards to (my perceived) value.  More of a "bid till people downstream from you pass and hope not to have to pay".

Mechanics feel solid,  the story arc just feels like it could be compressed into half the time.

Cards provide some goals and special abilities,  but feel a bit arbitrarily unbalanced.

USA map is (unnecesarily) big - "wide open" rather than tightly balanced is the feel that's given here.

Overall a fun title involving moving goods from city to city.  Very similar to age of steam, which having some unique elements of it's own.  The game board is probably a bit too big, and while the crafted plastic pieces look neat, they can be a pain in the ass to manage.  Also with a board so big with so much activity it was probably a bad idea to put a scoring track around the boarder.  I would recommend printing out a separate scoring track when playing this title.

Such a great train network, pick up and deliver. I love the open maps to lay track however you wish by paying different costs depending on terrain. It's a Wallace game so that means debt. What a great economic factor to allow debt leverage as far as you dare--brilliant. The trade between cities is so smartly simple. Upgrade your engine to complete longer linked deliveries. Draft auction objective cards for rewards or advantage ties in so well with history. Intuitive, easy to teach and then its a race to lay track. Turns are fast (mostly), eagerly await your next big move and more often than not, someone else takes it. Argh! But, there is always another move, and no one wins everything.

RATING: 7
Ok, so it's not so much a gamers game as Age of Steam. Nevertheless, I have to say that this is a very very good game and rates highly after my first play. Ok, the bad things are: Board, semi-gloss, trains more of a fiddle to me than the aesthetic gains they give to the game, especially on the Score track (Argh!)..However the Railroad Tycoon cards and Operations card in particular keep the pace of the game and the tension up quite a bit, at the same time the quality of design of these components are outstanding. I also wonder whether the game really needs the board as big as it really is but having played only the once I let it pass. Gameplay, after my initial paralysis at game start (I think where you start is extremely important and so you need to have a good overview from the start as to where the goods are and where to transport them to), plays a very fast pace and there always seems so much you want to acheive more your 3 actions per turn allow. Anyway, those people who refuse to play RT over AoS I slap you hereafter and say simply say, 'wake up and smell the coal'..it's definitely worth giving a crack.

I purchased RRT because I love Age of Steam and was impressed by what I thought was a grand redesign and super-sizing of the original system.

Within a few months, however, the flaws of RRT became apparent.  The board is too big, which means that a player can be left all alone - resulting in a win for that player more often than not.  In addition, the randomness in RRT is over the top (major lines and service bounties popping into existence, etc.), the building chokepoints on the gameboard are endlessly frustrating, and the fact that the 3-link delivery bonus and the 4-level engine bonus are only one action apart severely unbalances the game in the favor of the early leader.  These glaring problems meant that RRT soon became a game that I would only play with people who found Age of Steam too unforgiving or too competitive.

But now I think I'm at the point where I won't play RRT at all.  If I had never played Age of Steam, I would continue to find RRT a moderately entertaining game. Compared to AoS, however, the flaws in RRT are numerous and severe enough that I just can't take the game seriously.

Edit:  The new edition (Railways of the World) fixes many of these issues.  Nice to hear.

Played several times. I have been quite disappointed by this game, which keeps some interesting rules from Age of Steam, with some interesting changes, while adding annoying random elements (such as the cards). There might be balance issues between the various starting positions. Additionally, the huge board makes it difficult to follow what is happening on the other side (and the strange city colors do not help). I would play Age of Steam rather than this one any day.

It's just lots of fun to build up your network, and when you manage to make a few huge deliveries just as the game ends to blast down the score track, it's very satisfying. This game rewards long term planning in a way that I really enjoy.

I have also played a kids variant with my daughter; check the variants forum for it if you have kids in the 5 or so range. From there we added rules every game until she was playing the full game by the time she was almost 7.

I taught the game to 4 new comers. Making 5 including myself. We played without the cards or the western tiles. While I loved the game, I was really put off by the gigantic freaking board. I think we will try playing with just the top two sections next time. (BTW: I looooove AoS, this game has potential, but it will take me some time to warm up to it.) EDIT: Played with the tycoon cards and with poker chips instead of money. I still prefer AoS.

My heart sank when I first saw this game.  Large (Very large!)lots of pieces, and a conversion of a complex computer game.  I expected the same hash that they made of Civilisation the Boardgame.  As expected, the game took a long time BUT the gameplay is brilliant! Challenging, each turn is different, and little tweaks like the strategy cards that mean you never quite know who is ahead.  Only warning; dont play it with people who like to micro-manage, or those with short attention spans who dont watch what others are doing and plan their next move ahead...!

RATING: 6
Update: overplayed due to a fanatic subgroup in our club dropping my rating quite a bit.

Players aren't as poor as in AOS, but don't let that fool you -- this game is almost as tight on gameplay to make the highest score (Most score still comes from the balancing act of shipping a cube before an opponent vs upgrading engines and shipping it for a longer length). I like the different attack left issues that a clockwise turn order introduce into the game and the strategies it takes to avoid them. This is a game that rewards repeated play as studying the cards is important if you want to benefit from them and deny them to others (who I'm sure will say I got lucky).

RATING: 8
After half a dozen plays, nothing has changed in my initial evaluation. My only other complaint is that I don't get to play it enough.
What I like about the game:
There is some screwage, but not too much. I could get non heavy game players to play this when they would hate AoS.
The components look good, it is a very attractive game, and while playing it, you get a real sense of how big NA is.

What I dislike:
The board, it may be just a bit too big.
The trains used for scoring, combined with a big board will cause players to bump against the trains when they are laying track.
Blue and Purple... For the life of me, I forget which is which every time I play, those two colours are far too similar.

All in all, I enjoy the game and if these little details were fixed, I would give the game and 8-8.5

[b]Railroad Tycoon[/b]
I haven't played Age of Steam so I get the impression I'm settling for second best with Railroad Tycoon. That withstanding, my major beef with Tycoon is not really mechanics-related but rather lies with the blatant east coast dominance of the U.S. board and how nearly every facet of the game steers players in this direction. East coast cities are closely nested so the cost of building railroads over the course of the game is substantially cheaper. Their supply of goods is much deeper than the West and can easily fuel at least two players for the duration of the game. (Depletion of goods due to excess competition here isn't really detrimental either as this condition triggers the end-game, so the East can easily control the pace of the game.) These elements then bleed into the game's role cards because it's much more logical to build East to achieve most links, most contiguous links, fewest stock, most money, or first to L6 train. Ditto for many of the railroad cards, especially the major lines; the couple that spawn for the East are always of interest while something like New Orleans-Minneapolis can appear turn one and have no takers the entire game. The imbalance extends into the southwest area of the board and its automatic ghost town cities because they all require Perfect Engineering to access and even then are rarely worth the effort. Western Link suffers from the same problem, though there is a significant payoff associated if you manage to dedicate your entire strategy to forging one and succeed before too many cities become destitute and the game ends.

[b]Railways of England and Wales[/b]
Great expansion - somebody decided to fix nearly everything that was wrong with original Tycoon. Major lines no longer clog the deck of special cards and randomly reward players in that area when flipped because they are now objectives that begin on the board from turn one. Cities are much more reasonably spaced (no desolate breadbasket territory like Tycoon) and do not show preferential treatment to a single area of the board. More comments after future plays.

I've played this game once now and once with a different map and it was a lot of fun. I really enjoy pickup and deliver games and games where you're building out your so-called "empire". There's something cool about being able to sit back see what you've accomplished on the table at the end of the game.

The game itself is quite simplistic with its rule set, which is great because it allows you to focus on strategy. It's also interesting how tight things get as the game progresses and you start to get on top of one another and agonize about whether it's better to spend money to make your own track or utilize someone else's at the cost of having to pay them and potentially putting them in a better position. It's also very tight because everyone starts with nothing and you're immediately forced to issues shares in your railroad... shares that you can never pay off, and ones that you have to pay out dividends to every round and count against you at the end of the game. The game ends up being a balancing act between making the most of the opportunities that are out on the board but not gambling too much and overextending yourself. The player that can walk this tightrope most effectively is the winner and the games that I have played so far have been very close.

The main downfall of the game is the sheer amount of space that it takes up. It's HUGE! And the base game board begs to be played with 4+ people. Because of this, it has sit on my shelf for quite some time. Having now played the North America map, I'm very much interested in acquiring it because I think that it'll allow me to play it more frequently due to the fact that it can accommodate fewer players well.

RATING: 8
A medium weight train game with quite a few paths to earning VPs and therefore victory.

The issuing of bonds is the most innovative part of this game's mechanic. One gets to decide how fast your initial buildup will be, but that produces a drag on your later income and eventual VP total. The event cards, railway baron cards, and the initial placement of goods cubes all add to the replayability of the game.

The game components seem overproduced though. This is especially with the empty city markers. Perhaps the cost of the game could be reduced if these were simplified.

If it's true that Rails of Europe is much better then I have to buy it. Great economy game. I suppose it's not so good for 4- players.

9 -> 8.5 - down because of it's size and because Rails of Europe is better. Of course if I'll have 6 players I'll be more than glad to play RT

-- edit --
down to 7 - Steam is better in many ways. Still I like to play it a lot. Waiting for Railways of England and Wales

I played it quite a bit, but generally my strategy was fairly similar each game. I feel there are better supply/demand/economic games out there that have more interesting decisions to make and more varied strategies. Probably a good game to introduce other players to that style of game without overwhelming them, especially if they are not board gamers per se, and could have kept it in my collection just for that point. However it ended up getting sold. May try and find another similar game to replace it, or just teach people Power Grid straight away, which is my current favourite game of that type, and one of my favourite games full stop. 
Ended up selling Railways...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Shares many similarities to Age of Steam so that the learning curve wasn't as steep.  It is not as unforgiving as that game, but definitely allowed more interaction between the players, so it is more fun in terms of the social aspect.  I'm ambivalent towards the cards in Railroad Tycoon, they do make it more unique, but the advantages they offer are huge to player that can utilize them effectively as well as those that pay attention.  It's not as tense and at times doesn't feel as competitive as AoS, but RT is still a great economic building game that I would want to play again and again.

Update #1: After playing the expansion, I had to deduct a 0.5 rating from the original game because the former is such an improvement and probably my preferred map to use from now on.

So far, only played with [thing=72267][/thing]...
This game and [thing=19995][/thing] have a fair amount in common.  Unlike Canal Mania, your connections are not driven/constrained by contract cards: You can build links anyplace where the delivery opportunities are ripe, or wherever you bloody well wish.  The loan system is a gentler sum of the schemes used in [thing=28720][/thing] and [thing=39683][/thing]:  You can't pay back "loans", they permanently detract from your income, and they reduce your score at the end of the game.

A rather fun, medium-weight network-building game.  It has a lot in common with [thing=19995][/thing], without being inherently quite as fun; however, this game has numerous expansions, each of which varies the feel of the game nicely.

You have to like train games, nicely themed.  This is some what easier than Age of Steam but more complex than Ticket to Ride.   Yes the map is huge unnecessarily so, but at the end the game looks great and plays well.  The cards can add some unnecessary randomness but overall add to the game.  A fun game to play.

After 5+ Plays: Playing Railroad Tycoon is always a little bittersweet.  Yes, I enjoy the game, but in about the same amount of time we could play Steam or Age of Steam, which implement this system so much more effectively.  From the auction to the track-laying rules to the cards that come out every turn, I dislike basically all the changes this makes to Age of Steam.  The only thing I like is the Tycoon cards, but I've always had a soft spot for secret objectives.

The best of the train games I've played. Deep enough to be challenging, but quick enough to not inspire boredom. Like Conquest of the Empire, this game requires an exceptionally large table.

I'm thinking I'll wait for the 'Rails of' series release of the base game in the hopes that it'll fit onto a smaller table - either that or Rails to Riches.

With more plays, it has lost a bit of the shininess. It's not as good with 6.

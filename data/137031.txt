Player who went after me made sure that I never made a decision for the whole game... waiting for 20+ minutes between my turns. I was basically never able to make a decision, because there was always only one thing left. This game is truly an ancient and terrible thing. Terrible, terrible game... it was so bad at times that we were rolling in laughter just from how incredible unfair it was. Can't remember the last time we laughed so hard. I guess you could say it's so bad that it's good... but I just prefer good games. 

Further entertainment... you can play a card called 'Contingency Plan'.. which lets you take 3 feat cards from the deck and use them all... and if you're lucky, you may get a card that will let you do it all over again! Oh, and by the way... there's also all sorts of other wonderfully broken mechanics and cards. Did anyone playtest this game? I have no idea, but it certainly doesn't feel like it.

It's the theme and production that starts it off on a good foot. Fantastic illustrations and great components. The game play is interesting too - as you push your luck and make your way through cards. Tokens are gathered to modify your rolls, buy cards and power your special abilities. Since dice are spent to gather victory points or resources, you never feel like you have a wasted roll. Of course, bad rolls can still leave the feeling that the game is handed to one player over another - but you have to take that in stride in this type of experience. Over all, really enjoyable!

A Yahtzee-style game with a Cythos theme and Scooby-Doo style artwork.
Not bad, I've not really played it enough yet as I've had other games I've wanted to play more.
Seems solid, there are various challenges to try and succeed at each round getting progressively harder.  Equipment cards and tokens allow for a reasonable amount of dice mitigation and re-rolls.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
While I like the horror theme in general, it's pretty thin in this game and could really be anything. It has no meaning as you just see everything as symbols. Essentially Yahtzee with a few adjustments. Not a bad game overall but certainly not great.

RATING: 8
The 1st game we ever Kickstarted after seeing a preview by the Dice Tower's Ryan Metzler. A game of dice rolling and set collection with a theme steeped in a sort of classic horror/jungle trek style. The components for this are awesome though we got the cool dice and player mats through the Kickstarter stretch goals so whether they will come with the game if/when it reaches stores is debatable. We wish the theme was a bit more tied to the mechanics. But it is an overall fun game that is beautiful when it's all laid out on the table.

Excellent dice game with a 'generic' Lovecraftian theme. I love that murky, thick-lined artwork and the theme of traveling on a river near these ancient locations which I'm exploring for relics and rewards. Lots of mitigation based on the tokens you spend, it honestly falls somewhere between Elder Sign rolling and Ghost Stories resources but without the co operative elements and the defensive aspect. Actually, it might even be a good game to introduce to people you think wouldn't dig Elder Sign, it's a load of fun and slightly lighter, plus the intuitive nature of the Feats and dice challenges is fast to pick up. Fantastic.

RATING: 8
Initial Impression: The theme of this game is what makes it stand out from similar Yahtzee style dice rollers. Card and board artwork support the feeling of adventuring down a river, encountering ancient terrible things. The mechanisms in this game add some resource gathering and management twists. The concept of having to pay for your rerolls is interesting, as is being able to buy upgrades for future encounters. So far I've only played the solitaire variant but find it a solid game, with complexity ramping up in later turns as swag and abilities accumulate to almost staggering levels. Overall, I find this a thematic game that could almost certainly be used as both a gateway and a meatier filler game.

Much lighter than expected, but that's not a bad thing.  It's very nice to have something other than the awful Betrayal at House on the Hill to play on Halloween. (can't stand traitor mechanic/semi-coop games.)  

April 2017 - This is also an excellent solo game, and I love the mechanic of splitting your dice between the scenario card and the Ominous Encounter.  Upgrading the rating accordingly.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
This game has WAY too much downtime with 4 players, but that is the least of my worries with this one.  The thing that really is terrible about this game is the fact that you don't refresh the monsters until they are all gone from the board, which means that if you happen to be last, that you have no choice.  The Yahtzee mechanisms of not being able to save dice is stupid (there is a reason no one has done this yet), and all in all this game works, but isn't fun at all.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Wow... the 'terrible' in the name is definitely descriptive of this game.

Way too luck dependent and the luck will make or break your game. Some cards are way too powerful. Plus, with people who AP it is even worse, but even without AP'ers, it still would have sucked.

Fun light dice game - that scales quite well 2-4 (although I think it's better with more).

Re-roll system is a bit counter-intuitive (or rather different to all the other dice games I've played), you either re-roll all your dice, or spend re-roll tokens to reroll just one.

Once everyone knows the game it rolls along nicely, almost short enough to be a filler.

Overall, like it :)

The good: components and graphics

The bad:  heavy-load of luck dependence, dice manipulation is too weak

Interesting idea, theme and similar take on the dice action mechanic that's been done in other games like King of Tokyo. Only 1 gripe, but unfortunately it is a big one, lots of downtime as every player has to complete his entire turn of choosing what to go for, cards to play etc. There is just so much to do on your turn, including housekeeping, it kills all momentum and flow of the game. If you are playing with 3 or 4 this makes the game very tedious and boring while you wait for your turn with nothing to do. This would ok if this was a heavy game but it is meant to be a quick playing lighter game.

RATING: 7
A pretty fun dice game with a cool, original setting and a wonderful look. I like that you can still benefit from your die rolls even if you fail to collect the encounter card, and the location abilities make for some interesting choices. 

With that said, I do think there are some flaws: treasure tokens can sometimes be very hard to get, and since there is a lot of stealing throughout the game, the treasure tokens are even harder to hold onto. Without being able to buy much swag, the crucial "engine building" aspect necessary to conquer the later encounters may simply never occur. You might spend several turns trying to accomplish an impossible task with a single roll (a straight of five dice, four of a kind), unless you have fists full of Focus tokens. The game is also a little too long for what it is, and overstays its welcome by about a round or so. Major points for theme and graphic presentation, though.

[b]BGG Auction/KublaCon pickup - May 2016[/b]
Rather strange game.  You're explorers in the jungle trying to discover/defeat the Ancient Terrible Things.  You aim for a certain area and roll dice "yahtzee" style.  I use quote because if you choose to reroll, you must reroll ALL dice, any dice you want to keep you must use tokens to lock the dice PER ROLL.

There are special cards to help you along the way, or to earn bonus points at the end.

It feels that this game oozes with theme with the art and cards, but the dice don't really make sense.  But who really cares!  It's always fun to chuck dice!

RATING: N/A
Interested in 2nd Edition only.

The expansion for this doesn't look that interesting, looks like it adds a little bit more meanness to it, "take, steal", under the disguise of making it more interactive. Prefer getting into each other's way then that heavy handed take that, especially in 2 players games.

It is what has me off on wanting Konja, couple of take that, or trade that cards,  it adds in that red die in Konja, it seems wrong in 2 player games as they can only be directed at one person. Sometimes that can be too one sided lucky in a 2 player game.

The art carries the theme well but the mechanism is just a bunch of dice rolling.  The choices are intresting both beofer the dice rolling and with the rolling.  

The fate cards seem to get used infrequently as you often dont have enought fate chips to play them.  It dosen't seem to hurt my enjoyment of the game but I sometimes wonder why I am holding these cards that I never seem to play.  The equipment is more fun and more useful (buy it once and use it every turn). 

I think just a little more play testing could have ironed out these issues

Slick production.  Even the box is top quality.  Very nice game-play.  The restricted Yatzee dice rolling can be strongly mitigated if you get cards that manipulate the dice.  You'll need it as the artifacts/creatures (or whatever they're called) get alot more powerful in the last stack of cards dealt.  

Just has a nice feel, along with the good, comical artwork.  This game went completely under the radar it seems.  I like the "Weird Pool".

This is a decent dice game with awesome graphic design. I like the various cards and their effects and I like the jockeying for achievements and how/when to end the game. My main issue with the game is that the way re-rolls are handled are much more strangely than in similar yahtzee-styled games (which throws non-gamers for a loop) and that getting the dice rolls you need, is more critical in this game than others. I like it better than King of Tokyo but there are other game of a similar weight I would rather play.

Very nice art design, and the push-your-luck yahtzee dice assignment happens to be something I enjoy.
However, it doesn't feel like much horror is taking place in this game.  If you fail at an encounter with a something terrible and ancient you... lose between 0 and 3 victory points.  A little more downtime than I'd like, too.  My opinion after just one long play of the base game, with four somewhat slow players.

Feels like a non coop version of elder signs with a slight different theme. You have different resource counters that you gain throughout the game that will help you in the encounters and also to gain VP achievement cards.

Not being able to lock in dice naturally makes it harder to retool properly on paper but it seems the extra resources you gain and the abilities at your disposal help offset that. Everyone scored really well in the first game I played and I almost no one got negative points

Issue with this game is downtime in between turns. Also the items you get never really fell like they help much with the dice rolls in the encounters, they are mainly to get some more VPs.

I think you have to get into the thematic element of this game and create a suspenseful narrative to enjoy this game.

This game could be good as a two player game, with three or four there is simply waaaaaay too much downtime.. i could have easily played another game because after you've done your turn you got 15 minutes in wich you have nothing to do!
The theme is pasted as pasted can be, that in itself wouldn't bother me too much, but the components & artwork are pretty darn good so somehow you expect the theme to fit the mechanics.. but nothin'.

If you don't care for the theme, wanna play this with 2 or don't mind long pauses & enjoy dice manipulation games, check this out.

A fun light hearted dice chucker, if you like to roll dice and manipulate them with various cards and tokens abilities you will enjoy this game. A great game to play with the family or enjoy with your buddies and a few cold ones. Excellent if you want to enjoy conversation between turns as you can more or less blitz them on the fly. The theme and artwork really capture my imagination as well. Don't go into this thinking your going to get some kind of deep brain burner! It's a casual game; and that's how it should be played.

Expedition for all ages! 


I have played this game many times with my son (8) and his friends. I thought initially it would be too complex but they all love it! It definitely has the complexity of an adults game but kids enjoy it too. Our kids love Kings of Toyko which has less complex game play but ATT is not beyond them.

It is not a horror game and it is not in any way scary or inappropriate for kids. 

The artwork is amazing, the game is good quality, it is great to open a game that is so rich in theme and quality.

I love the fact that every time you play you learn how to improve and that the " skill vs luck" component becomes apparent the more you play it. 

This is a great purchase for your board gaming shelf.

I actually enjoy games that use dice to limit action selection, like [thing=73439][/thing] and [thing=55670][/thing]. But when the goal is to simply get combos in order to get points, then the game loses me. I don't think Ancient Terrible Things is a bad game in the genre. But I need to stop even considering picking these games up. They just don't last beyond a play or two for me. Even if you like these kinds of games, I suspect replay-ability will be an issue with this one. There isn't enough variety in cards and actions to keep it fresh.

Players go to locations, which give them a few things, and then they face off against the encounter at the location. Encounters have a dice combo on them that a player needs to roll to eliminate it. If it is eliminated, then the player keeps the card for points. If the encounter is not eliminated, then the player gets a few minus points with "Terrible Thing Token" - dun dun dun!!. Then the player can buy one or two items and end their turn. Rinse and repeat until all encounters are complete or all the Terrible Thing Tokens (dun dun dun!!) have been claimed. The artwork is pretty good and the components are quality, at least.

I like dice games. This is a good solid dice game if nothing exceptional. It reminds me of Favor of the Pharaoh in the way the game builds, starting with very basic capabilities you build up both your dice and ways to manipulate them. Not quite as good as Favor, but a pretty good alternative.

In Ancient Terrible Things, a pulp horror adventure game for 2-4 players, you play the role of an intrepid adventurer, exploring a dark jungle river. Each turn you must travel to a Fateful Location, face an Ominous Encounter, and attempt to unlock its Ancient Secrets. If you succeed (using a combination of dice, tokens and cards), you add the Secrets to your score; if you fail, you unleash a Terrible Thing, which counts against your score at the end of the game. The object of the game is to be the player with the most Ancient Secrets when the game ends at the Unspeakable Event.

Game play involves rolling dice to achieve combinations: runs, pairs, three or more of a kind, and single die showing a particular number or higher. Dice combos are used to overcome Encounter cards that are worth points at the end of the game, and/or to acquire the four resource tokens in the game: Focus, Courage, Treasure and Feat.

One of the best Yahtzee variant games out there with some really great art.  My only thing is it could REALLY benefit from an expansion that adds more monster/goal cards.  In one game you hardly touch the blue deck and the item deck but you see all of the monsters/goals in no time.  Sadly, it seems unlikely that an expansion will happen, maybe I'll have to make my own?

Demoed at Essen 2014. This was a pretty enough game with a little dice rolling and tableau building. I am aware I did not get the full game experience as we merely demoed it, but it did not grab me and I am not in a hurry to try it again. The decisions did not seem to have much meaning and the points and goals were all fairly generic and balanced. Meh.

I'm such a sucker for Yahtzee type games that offer actual decisions to be made.  Adds on some resource management to help tip the luck in your favor, which I love.  I've always liked the gearing up you can do in Elder Sign, but this does it much better.  You're more in control of what you get since the cards are face up.

Nice, yahtzee-style dice chucker with terrific art and a wonderfully campy horror theme. Items and skills help mitigate the luck of the role and add some strategy. The risk-reward decisions of which location to search and when are at the heart of the game and result in both the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.

This is a dice rolling yatze type game with some differences regarding the way the re-rolls are done.

I like the cool theme, Love the art and the humor put in all that.

The game is quite simple and very luck dependent... you have of course the dice but also the Feat Cards that you get in your hand are very important for you to be able to mitigate the luck of the roll... but there's the luck of the draw...

I liked the game but I can understand those that don't like it because of that... you have to know what you are going to play and accept the luck or lack of it  and get into the theme.

RATING: 5
I've heard a lot of people say that this is similar to Elder Sign. I got more of a Roll For It vibe while playing, with a touch of Yahtzee thrown in so you aren't stuck with your initial roll. The game is pretty unexciting though. First off, the artwork is atrocious. It makes the original Ascension: Chronicle of the Godslayer artwork look amazing in comparison. The rest of the game had this pasted on theme of Cthulhu meets The Heart of Darkness, and I just couldn't get into it. 

The rolling dice and special abilities were fine, but this doesn't come anywhere close to unseating other games in this genre like Star Trek: Five Year Mission and the Rick and Morty: Mr. Meeseeks Dice Game that I enjoy far more. Plus the arbitrary points you get for overcoming challenges just feels like a way to keep scores artificially close. Anyone who says that this makes Elder Sign feel obsolete doesn't know what they're talking about. This is a perfect example of a Kickstarter game that brings absolutely nothing new to the table.

You choose what mission to go for and play Yahtzee, with re-rolls that cost you, to achieve it. It's a ton of luck. Don't expect anything less. Hope you draw some "To Court The King" type dice manipulation cards, or get the tokens to buy some ongoing benefits (if they're available in the limited draft on your turn) to be able to improve as the missions get harder. Yep, more luck to add to the luck. It's a game where it's important to be able to go along with the ride. If that's you, you'll probably enjoy it. If you have a poor first game, you'll probably think it sucks. I had fun with it though.

Beautiful artwork and components. Even the theme is nicely integrated and player interaction is good. What sucks about this game is that the dice rolls are so luck dependent, you have to reroll all the dice most of the time or spend valuable tokens to lock one die per token. So you cannot fix your dice result up in three rolls the same way you can do it in Yahtzee or Roll Throgh the Ages.

RATING: 6.4
Pros:
* Dice chucking fun
* Works well for 2
* Special-power cards (Feats) are cheap to play and can be played at any time so neat combos are common.

Cons:
* Game can really slow down while players figure out the right combination of Feat and Swag powers.

Neutral:
* I've only played the game once so far, but I appreciated that the cost of losing an encounter wasn't crippling. You don't get the points, but you still got the tokens AND now you get to spend all of your dice on more tokens. In one round, my dice rolled poorly for the encounter but perfectly for getting what I needed from the store so I decided to fail the encounter and stock up for the future instead. It's nicely balancing.
* It can be quite deflating to burn through a bunch of Feat cards and Focus tokens, lose an encounter and have dice values that are also worthless in the store.

= 2016-02-21

Somewhat disappointed after our first play. It felt less about the dice and more about having the right Feat cards or Courage tokens at the right time. Not sure what I expected going in, and I'm not sure that the game doesn't deliver exactly what it promised, but I'm not sure if what it delivered is what I wanted.

Feels a bit clunky. I imagined there would be more way to get the special dice and more ways to manipulate rolls, but the game is a bit too restricing in what you can do, so a lot of it comes down to luck. The first phase of monsters are fairly easy and don't require players to spend too many tokens, but the 2nd wave will likely eat up your resources and by the third wave you'll probably fail to defeat most monsters. Too difficult to save up enough tokens to use feats or buy swag. This game could use some serious tweaking to provide more focus on the mechanics that are actually fun.

RATING: 8
Easy to learn and straight forward game, just make sure you have the dice rolling rules correct (3 rolls max unless a card gives you extra rolls.) I like the idea that you must roll ALL the dice on re-rolls unless you pay with Focus tokens or acquire special dice. It sounds hard but we have found the game to be not too easy and not too hard either.

The components and artwork are wonderful. We have never been able to find a scary themed game that we liked (we do not like co-ops or zombies) so we took a chance on this. If you like dice rolling along with manipulation through cards and tokens, you should like this. It's a good medium light family type game.

We did change one rule, we keep our success cards (points won) secret. During our first game we could easily see near the end who was going to win, and we don't like that.

Over all a good game, and the games do get more fun as you learn the cards.

Rating based on three, 2 player games.

Fun version of Yahtzee with some really neat choices and item purchasing.  I enjoyed it quite a bit.  Curious about the expansion and would like to play again.

I actually didn't mind this game at all.  Now that I know the rules I don't think it would take too long to bang a game out and it plays really smooth and was fun.

The game feels very similar to something like Elder Sign.  Each player takes turns tackling a Yahtzee-style dice rolling challenge where they are trying to get pairs, runs, all dice over a certain number, etc. to earn points.  Each location also has a special ability and there are cards you can play for one time effects and items you can buy for permanent effects.  That's essentially the whole game.

For a quick filler this was engaging and, like I said, played really smooth.  I'm always wary of Kickstarter games, especially ones with less buzz.  Even good Kickstarter games can have a couple hiccups on release but this one seemed really well play-tested and constructed.

RATING: 7.5
Ancient Terrible Things is a fairly good game with outstanding visuals that failed to achieve greatness due to just a few issues (It seems under-tested). The main problem is that for a dice manipulation game, there's now enough ways to actual manipulate dice, therefore you feel that the strategy is only to correctly assess your chances and hope for the best.
I like games like this, but the question is always the same: if it's going to be very simple and mostly rely on luck, like King of Tokyo, is perfectly fine, and it makes it a party game where losing or winning is vastly the consequence of chance, with some tactical play still required. ATT aims for more, as it adds some layers of complexity, but ultimately fails to make this added complexity significantly add to the strategic and tactical game. You get more cards, which only makes you have a better chance to get the needed results, without adding important decisions.

There are also some minor issues, like the somewhat clunky market.

Do not add the expansion. It's a great disservice to the game. They added interaction using take that cards, a weird prophecy mechanism, too many objectives cards and the new cards further add to the difficulty of finding dice manipulation cards.

OK dice game of beating monsters and buying items. It's a bit too long for a fun dice game and a bit too dicey to bee rewarding as a game of this length. I enjoyed my one play, though.

Fun pulp horror theme, but not gruesome and not Cthulhu. Use dice to roll certain combinations to meet requirement on expedition cards to overcome challenges for points. Can also earn bonus chips to help you in rolls or buy swag to increase your efforts. Great production, great player aid, smooth, quick and intuitive.

Explore a dark jungle river, face ominous encounters and try to avoid unleashing the ANCIENT TERRIBLE THINGS.

Seems to be the game best suited to fill the dice-rolling spot, as VivaJava is already present and Kingsburg is less thematic.

Check out (including expansion) @Essen2015. KS price incl expansion was $54 (~€50), which is a tad too expensive for carton + d6s with pips only.

A fantastic design,  this is a fast, fun filled dice fest that scales to perfection.

The presentation is upper tier,  while the theme and mechanics mesh in perfect harmony.

While it will never be considered a deep experience, this is so much more than just rolling dice and attempting to overcome listed combinations on the game cards.  The location benefits, achievement considerations and the tokens earned, offer many decisions on each and every turn.

Despite the game's title,  there is nothing even close to terrible here.

I've yet to find a really good dice game. This might just be one - with all the different kinds of tokens and the things they do, it looks like there are plenty of ways to mitigate the randomness. Plus, it's sort of Cthulhu-themed, which is nice.

Having a blast playing this game. Im a big fan of yahtzee style games and Ancient Terrible Things has this and more. The game has many fun dice challenges, special cards that manipulate the dice and gameplay. And i like the DiceQuest system to acquire tokens that can be used in many different ways. Glad i got this game!

Not bad for a light dice roller, and sets itself apart from similar games like Elder Sign enough to warrant a look. But ultimately a bit too luck based for my tastes, despite some strong design decisions and streamlined game play.

this game is great! You have dice rolling, card "buying", push your luck and strategy all in one. The artwork is phantastic too. 
The expansion makes it even better. I can clearly recommend this one as one of my favourites to play.

Very smooth playing dice game from Kickstart no less.  Easy to play and thematic.  Even the advanced version is pretty quick (at least with two).  My single complaint is a minor one.  I feel the art is muddled with too much green.  Though this does convey a creepy feeling I think the pallet could have been more diverse.

Pulp horror adventure exploring a dark jungle river. Yahtzee clone on steroids. Special character boards. Defeat encounters by rolling specific yahtzee combinations. Get focus, courage, treasure of feat tokens. Get items and use swag to last to the unspeakable event. Gaining special cards makes the dice roll decisions get fun. Nice art is inviting to play.

It's Yahtzee. But with monsters. And more frustration. And items. And it's simply great. It takes a long time to go through the 36 challenge cards and reach the end of the game, but it doesn't feel like it drags on. Every turn, it feels like you're doing something worthwhile, even if it doesn't work out. I guess it doesn't feel a ton like a competitive game, because there's nothing you can do to another player on their turn, you just use cards on your own turn that will affect them. Case in point: first game, I left for 20 minutes after my turn. They played to my next turn and waited, and I didn't miss anything at all.

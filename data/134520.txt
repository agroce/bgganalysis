Got in trade 10/4/17 for B-17 Flying Fortress Leader (my extra copy in shrink)
Initial rating based on one play--short Cuban Missile Crisis.  First 2 missions a success-target destroyed.  The third and final mission was a disaster.  My only target choices were tough (4 politic pts) and I only managed 2 pts of damage to the target but lost all 5 a/c.  Ouch!!  This is gonna be different than HL:CAO.

Over time the game became my favorite from DVG. During a campaign you become attached to your pilots. The rules are straight forward and easy to remember. The rule book is a showcase of how to do it right. Planning a mission and the following action are tense. As a bonus you get that "Flight of the Intruder" feeling.

RATING: 9
Modern and stylish presentation; Suitable for beginners and veterans alike; components of high quality; solitaire game which also works perfectly as a 2-player cooperative game; much to decide and consider during a game; many randomized elements provide a high replayability; adjustable in game length and difficulty level; comprehensive and clear rules; easy to learn, but demanding and challenging gameplay; provides background information about friendly aircraft and weapons…but still no information or design notes about enemy units; no hints about coop gameplay included in the rulebook

Très bon jeu solitaire. 
Les choix à poser par le joueur sont nombreux et cruciaux pour la réussite des missions : choix des cibles, choix des pilotes, armement des avions, plan de vol, tactique aérienne et de bombardement.... 
Bref un système de jeu excellent et immersif servi par un matériel à la hauteur.

The best of Hornet and Phantom Leader.
Campaigns, planning, random events and a lot of action makes this solitary boardgame a winner.
Choosing weapons can be a bit overwhelming but after a couple of plays it opens up for a lot of strategy and tactics.

I really enjoy The Leader Series of games. I like that the missions play quick and over time a real connection begins to form with the pilots. If the series has a downside it is that it is heading down a trend of more, more, more. And that's actually become a deterrent from me playing as much as I could or should. I'm just hit with this wall of options, not really sure what to do. And basically I shut down. What would be very welcome is a little setup guide, a squad of pilots that are a good mix for a scenario, so I'm not thumbing through dozens of pilots just not sure who to take or for what reasons.

I will keep for years and years.  Scoring a rating of 'Great' can be very difficult.  Short campaigns don't really let your pilots advance.  Play the long campaign and prepare for some tough decisions.  Planning your approach and load-outs are key.  I usually take one of each weapon counter out and place it on the campaign board right over top the weapon lists.  Do the same for special weapons and it makes determining load-outs much easier.  Focus on destroying the target and use rockets to suppress some sites.  Pay the SOs to destroy SA-2s that are a threat.  Also be very careful of the M1939s that can target you - they are deadly.

Phantom Leader is a good solitaire Vietnam aerial warfare game. Planning your missions and executing them are equally interesting. The mechanics flow well and give plenty of interesting opportunities for decisions. The components are  good quality but I dislike the art, looking amateur at best, as it is always the case with DVG games. The only major complain I have is that the threshold between failure and success in any given campaign is too narrow. This is particularly frustrating on long campaigns, that only a couple of bad turns can render unrecoverable. It turns out you can make a perfect game and lose the entire campaign on a mere few bad rolls. Vice versa, a bad start will make the whole campaign pointless. I would have liked a system that favors steady play over major chance swings. Still, Phantom Leader will be a lot of fun for most solo players in search of a solid modern aerial warfare experience.

A component-quality boost over Phantom Leader. It adds interesting rules, like attack angles or flight paths, and it still smells like Napalm!

Pros: you get all the good things from PL and HL:CAO. High quality components. Intense. Immersive. Strong narrative.

Cons: if you have PL, then you have to purchase the game again.

Took a little time to get into, as with any wargame, but once it got in the air, it ran smoothly. The game is in the campaign. However exciting each mission can be, what makes this game great is the long term perspective. Only played a short campaign (and a half), but will soon start a long one.

RATING: 8
31 July 13 iPad version. Really enjoying this one on the iPad. Frustrating when a political event occurs and you can only attack the centre units or not allowed to attack AAA units or such. Difficult for attacking aircraft.
I like this better than TAL. I like the abstract tactical display better. TAL takes too long to set up and play - so it sits in the cardboard unplayed. In TAL you fly your plane around a battlefield made of hexagons. This means a lot more rules than Phantom Leader.
I also like taking a flight of 5 - 7 planes on a raid. Each plane has its own specific mission. In TAL, I usually only flew 1 or 2 aircraft.
I will probably buy Hornet Leader next as it interests me more than the Vietnam war.

Very enjoyable Game from the DVG Leader Series.  Note that the amount of time setting up scenarios and defenses, selecting pilots and weapons, and documenting post mission results exceeds the actual amount of time your squadron is in action with you rolling dice for results.  But I enjoy all of it equally.  Easy to understand rule book.  Game captures the flavor of the air war with often costly raids against targets insignificant to the overall outcome of the war.  Politics track can limit selection of targets which is an interesting angle.  Random selection of pilots (if you choose) can lead to interesting mix of pilots, especially if you end up with "slow" pilots who can only attack after the enemy attacks.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
For me, what really makes the Leader series stand out is the RPG element, by which I mean the persistent characters. Over the course of a campaign you really become invested in your pilots, bringing a welcome human element to what is often the overly dry and detached experience of boardgaming (after all, in most games people are treated very abstractly, represented as nothing more than coloured cubes, numbers on a chit or pips on a block). 
I've played several titles in the Leader series, but Phantom Deluxe is my favourite, mostly thanks to the Vietnam setting. Besides the intrinsic interest of that setting, some particulars, such as the unreliability of missiles in this era making for some interesting loadout dilemas, and the need to assign ingress and egress points, add depth to the experience. There's also a wide variety of aircraft to try out, and the choice of commanding either a US Air Force or a US Navy squadron, so in all in all you get quite a lot for your money.

Would be a 10, if not for Hornet Leader: Carrier Air Operations. Three different scenarios covering the span of the Vietnam air war, further divided by separate USAF and USN campaigns. Huge array of aircraft. The tactical area is a bit smaller than that of HL:CAO, and it offers a different experience with ingress and egress routes, and enemy units that can only cover certain quadrants. The deluxe edition also expands pilot experience levels to 6, just like HL:CAO. As with that game, I love the RPG aspects as the pilots improve; you get pretty attached to them which provides a satisfying element of story and drama.

One short campaign so far - Cuba 1962 with the USN. No a/c lost, but with mission VP's of +2, +1 and -2(!), there's clearly a lot to learn here in appropriate loadout and approach tactics. Tons of fun, highly recommended.

Update: several more long campaigns completed. Easy to learn, straightforward system that's quick to play. If you have interest in the period, the equipment or solo play in general PL/D is an easy recommendation for a quick & simple fix of JP-4 and napalm.

RATING: 8
The different between [b]Hornet Leader[/b], set in the Modern Era, and [b]Phantom Leader[/b], set in the Vietnam Era, is incredibly stark. Although much of the same equipment is available in both periods (e.g. AIM-9 air-to-air missiles), the limited availability of guided munitions (e.g. GBU-12 laser guided bombs) and the presence of powerful anti–aircraft artillery means that you'll feel lucky if most of your pilots survive a long campaign.

Moreover, the technological gap between your forces and the enemy's in [b]Phantom Leader[/b] is much narrower than in [b]Hornet Leader[/b]. Your F-4 Phantom II will be pitted against the latest MiG-21 Fishbeds and SA-2 SAMs supplied to the North Vietnamese by the Soviet Union. The air war portion of the Vietnam War was highly attritional. Just a sampling of the aircraft losses: 138 F-4 Phantoms, 445 F-4 Phantom IIs, 243 F-100 Super Sabres, 87 A-6 Intruders, and the list goes on.

This game is a tense, frustratingly masochistic experience, but when you successfully complete a mission you feel elated with a true sense of accomplishment.

Not as good as Hornet Leader or Thunderbolt Apache Leader. The most vanilla game in the series. Initial rating of 5.

Another great game in the leader series. Initially this looks harder than "Thunderbolt Apache Leader" (TAL). I first tried a short War in the South. Extremely difficult to fly with 2 less planes per mission. Now I'm playing Rolling Thunder, long campaign. So far Everything is working out great. Being able to attack from high altitude with SO Weapons makes it much more easy.

Just as with TAL the game is about planning. How do increase your odds of achieving victory in a mission? How do you manage your resources to last the entire campaign? Plan poorly and your planes will begin to fall from the skies.

TAL and PLD are different enough for me to warran owning both of them and still looking forward to Huey Leader....

My first foray into DVG and it has been a great experience. Great solo game. Lots of options and you never know exactly what you are facing until you arrive at the target. Campaign setup may take about 30 minutes but missions can be played quickly and individual mission setup is relatively quick. I highly recommend this game if you like solo games and are interested in the subject.

I have purchased this only because TAL is so good... but this is another masterpiece of game. Even if it is less visual appealing than TAL (but components are high quality) gameplay is solid, quick to setup and play; very difficult to beat! You feel the difference for the era hardware (1960's and 1970's) and for flying high speed jets. In few words: another awesome solitaire wargame in which you won't miss a "human" enemy. Recommended to anyone.

RATING: 9
It's been a long time since a game robbed me of a night's sleep by enticing me to "play just one more turn", over and over again. Phantom Leader's campaign based play makes every decision critical and when I blow one, I need very badly to see if I can make up for it in the next mission.

The majority of your time with this game is spent planning for these missions. Choosing pilots, weapon load-outs and angles of attack. That all sounds very complicated, but amazingly, after a mission or two it all becomes very intuitive. The game looks like an intimidatingly heavy war game, due to all the busy looking chits, but there is a very logical layout to them and again, after your second mission they become second nature.

It's not completely about pre-planning however. There are plenty of surprises once your flight teams hit the target zone. Unexpected enemy planes, redeployed AA guns and bad intel can leave you one missile short of executing your mission and then the game really begins. Your pilots will dodge most shots with ease, assuming you let them evade. The problem is evasive maneuvers create a ton of stress on the pilots. Too much stress and they become unfit to fly, so it is very tempting to simply let them take fire. This is modern combat, in all it's lethality though...so all it takes is one hit and you can be down a pilot and out a multi-million dollar piece of machinery.

I am enjoying the hell out of Phantom Leader. I'm not sure of the legs yet, since I have only recently gone down the rabbit hole. If the tense decision making is still here 20 plays from now, this will easily be one of my all time favorites. It's not that I expect it won't hold up, but rather that I could see someone solving the puzzle and allowing successful missions to become almost automatic. Happily, I'm nowhere near that level of competency yet and honestly, I hope I never get there. I'd hate to lose all this fun I'm having being a terrible squadron leader.

It's too bad that the pilots and the aircraft aren't separate cards, as in the later design Thunderbolt Apache Leader - and that the combat is a bit less tactical than in that game. Nevertheless, the air war over Vietnam is nicely thematic and creates a narrative each time you play. The technology and the politics of the era are faithfully represented and the nastiness of the war soon hits you in the face. High quality stuff for consim enthusiasts.

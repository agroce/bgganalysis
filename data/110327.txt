Too noninteractive, with an exception in one card that basically says "Fuck you" to one player. The one that forces them to complete a bad quest before moving on. Yeah that could've been balanced better.

RATING: 8.8
My favourite worker placement game (I find Agricola too dull and Le Havre too strategically overwhelming, although arguably better it isn't for me, at least on iOS), Lords of Waterdeep uses fairly basic mechanics to create a stripped-down euro that encourages interaction and blocking without spite, and demonstrates decent replay value through quests and buildings.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My first few plays of this was with 2, and I liked it alright. But it became rather stale, and I was debating on lowering the score to an alright #6.

But after having played my last 5-6 games with 4 or 5, it really have to stay at 8, or 8,5 if I could rate it that. It is so well put together and with the right group it is just plain fun and hectic to get the resources you want.

We have also used it to introduce some friends to the hobby, and 2 of them bought it on a whim, and are actually our main gamepartners now. The others also caught up on the game really quick, and enjoyed the sessions.

A great recommendation as a gateway euro, that might be a weenie bit heavier than Ticket to Ride and stuff like you normally consider a gateway game.

Very good game. Love the quests and the buildings... I only wish it came with meeples instead of cubes!... and, definitely, some asymetric faction powers!

RATING: 9
For what it is, that is to say a readily accessible eurogame with flavourful theming, it is astonishing. The production quality is to the standard one would expect of a Hasbro subsidiary with such a history, and the game even develops positively as an experience with the inclusion of the expansion (an enviable quality most designers cannot match). 

As such it is an excellent gateway game, but one that harbours replayability.

Great worker placement game with a D&D theme kind of pasted on.  Your main resources are adventurer cubes which will just get referred to by there color for the most part.

Very fast and streamlined worker-placement. I love that everyone "gets it" within two turns, and once you know the rules you never need to look at the rulebook again (there's basically no rules confusion or disputes). The theme is a bit tacked on, but the production quality is fantastic. You get a lot of game for your 75 minute investment.

RATING: 6
This is an average game that is as average as average gets.  The game never feels like it is progressing and the secret lord cards play the game for you.  Not a big fan of this game, but I can see its appeal for new board gamers that are coming from a analogous hobby.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Rated after one play.  A fun worker placement game, although I'd probably pick Caylus over this one.

---

Another play in and this one's rating is already starting to drop.  Unlike other worker placement games that I've played, this one only seems to have one path to victory (complete quests).  As such, Lords of Waterdeep turns into an optimization game of who can complete their quests in the most efficient manner.  Compare this to Caylus or Agricola where players can get points through a variety of means.  Waterdeep is a game that I probably won't turn down, but will never suggest to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Easy to teach and intuitive, but with some strategy. But the "take that" elements of the game are just a total drag. Leads to ganging-up and king-making way too easily. Also intrigue card draw and quest turn create a pretty luck based game.

Played this three times now and it's a really good game, pretty much everything I hoped Ankh Morpork by Martin Wallace would be. A very pleasant game with solid euro mechanisms and rules that are fully understood by the end of round one. Enough theme and flavour to give the game a slight D&D feel, although meeples instead of cubes for the adventurers would have been a nice touch to support the imagination if you're that way inclined. As for me I'm perfectly happy to be collecting cubes! Overall, strongly recommended, and I've just acquired a copy.

This is a contender for one of the best eurogames of 2012 imo.

This is a solid worker-placement game with nice aesthetics, and a not-overpowering theme - minimal flavour text etc. The engine-building aspects are not complex, and the game is primarily set-collecting, but it all works nicely, and in a good shortish time-frame. The curse of many Euros, the cubes never get called by their real titles and hence the theme is never fully realised.

7+ plays / 4,5,6 players

Mostly played with the expansion.

LIKE: A relatively fast worker placement. Secret goals offer variety. Multiple paths to victory. Quest cards are fun. Buying buildings adds a bit of engine-building fun.
DISLIKE: Can feel a bit repetitive, some intrigue cards are overpowered/swingy. The 40-point quest cards ensure victory. Can be cruel and cutthroat at times.

OVERALL: Fun game, but a bit swingy.

RATING: 7.5
As everyone has said, this game is quite good. It isn't remarkable, however, but it is very well constructed and produced. The fantasy theme is completely pasted on as only titles and pictures tell you anything - mechanically, it is bone dry Euro - and yet still sits well. As with all ramp up the selection games (Agricola, Caylus, Endeavor, etc), the game tends to slow and creak as analysis settles in and options fan out. Our game had a king-maker situation at the end in which I had two options for my last play - either one of which determined the victor. There is also some aspects of upstream player order sniping off the parts you need - especially so if you are playing along similar strategy lines. And I could imagine some random roll out of buildings, Lords cards and Quests making the game miserable for some. But other than that, there isn't much to dislike. A solid work and I'd play it again, but I doubt it has much staying power.

A solid 6er.
Almost flawless mechanics and fast gameplay. Nice components, too. Why not to give a higher rating then? Well, the game leaves very little room for longer term strategies. I'd also like to see the game evolve into something spectacular towards the end, but no. You just keep completing a quest after quest in no particular order of significance and having no or very little effect on your future actions.

Ok, game. Just do not expect too much from it.

The lack of dramatic arc ruins the game. Your first mission may be the most valuable one while the last has no significance for the outcome of the game.

RATING: 7
I was almost put off by the "dungeons and Dragons" tag.  I have memories of watching very obsessive sessions of that in the 70s.  However, this game has nothing to do with that.  It could be about anything.  The theme does not come though - which sounds boring.  But it isn't.  It's an interesting engine and a good game of about the right length.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A typical worker placement Euro with an Ameritrash theme pasted on.  It plays well, but doesn't have anything original about it.  Those who dislike direct conflict will be turned off by the Intrigue cards, some of which can be used to directly attack opponents.

UPDATE: After a second play, I've lowered my rating a half point because I feel like there is too much luck involved in the game with regards to Quest cards and Intrigue cards.  Drawing the right Quest cards to match with one's Lord card plays too big a factor for my liking, and it's a largely random factor.  Sure, there are ways to bury Quest cards that other players may need, but taking an action to set back a single opponent at some cost to yourself is a net loss for you in games of 3+ players.  The same is true of the Mandatory Quests.  Playing a Mandatory Quest on one player doesn't affect any other players, and costs you an Intrigue card play.

All in all, it's an okay game, but a bit too random and confrontational to make a good Euro game.

+Fun theme that may appeal to those turned off by the usual Euro game themes.
+Nice gateway to Euro-style games.
+Easy to learn.

-Lots of direct attacks on other players.
-Possibility of king-making.
-Large degree of randomness involved in Quest cards.

RATING: 7
Fun worker placement based on the D&D Franchise. Plays better with 2 than with 4. The theme is really weak in this one; The makers were fooling no one with the "Cleric/Fighter/Wizard/Rogue" Cubes that are needed to complete tasks.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Just rather bland. It doesn't really feel like there are many decisions here, just get cubes to do your quest and complete it. There's no real long term planning and there are so many actions available that you don't really compete. So many better work placements out there.

IMHO the best mix between fantasy and worker placement games. You don't have to have read or played anything in the Forgotten Realms universe. The idea I like the most is that you are a manager of adventureres, you have to hire rogues, mages, clerics and warriors in order to fulfill quests. I am the only one I know that reads the flavor text on the quests, it is a plus for the ones familiar with the universe...and doesn't affect the others or the game play. I played it over 20 times, even though I have the expansion, we never felt that we had enough of the base game. The thing I like most is that was easily accepted by all people in our group... no one disliked it and it is always the group's first choice. I rate it 10 because of that.

RATING: 7.78
Rating together with its expansion, [I]Scoundrels of Skullport[/I].

This is one game where the expansion substantially improved the base game.  Absent the expansion, the base game is not bad, but it is sort of dull.  There aren't a lot of interesting choices, though arguably it is still better than a lot of other gateway games out there.  

It's sort of a collect cubes, spend cubes kind of game, with a little bit of "take that" in the form of Intrigue Cards.

RATING: 7
Worker placement with a really well integrated theme. Unlike many typical "soulless euros", in Lords of Waterdeep You aren't just placing meeples on spaces and trying to optimize a cube economy with a pretty vague reason as to the why. No, in lords you are placing members of your lords house/faction (meeples) in different districts of the city of water deep in order to build certain buildings or take actions that involve sending different groups of clerics, Warriors, Wizards, and Rogues on quests. The more quests you complete, the more points you will earn for end game scoring. This game is a really well put together experience. According to the lore, wotc staff had to make the game on their lunch breaks and then pitch it to the executives after the fact because they initially thought it was a terrible idea. This was a labor of love and it shows in the design. Bravo.

This might be one of my favorite games in our collection.   
We vary the starting rules a bit, rather than randomly giving out one Lords to each player, we have started to give each player two lords to pick from, (randomly dealing two to each player, then picking)  this has helped diversify the lords we play.

This is truly one outstanding game. There is a lot of variety and the game scales magnificently with more or less players.

A competitive game that isn't so fierce as to ward off new players.

Lords of Waterdeep is a simple worker-placement game with a nice twist - named intrigues.
Although the theme is just pasted onto the game and the mechanism is pretty simple (go there, take this) Lords of Waterdeep is actually quite fun to play. Not a game to play again and again and again, but worthwhile in between. Its refreshing nowadays to have a worker placement game that simple when other games of this genre try to beat each other with overly complex rules and options.

I like it. It's not that difficult, so it's pretty easy to teach and the number of choices isn't insanely huge like in some worker placements. There's a lot less blockage like some too, so that's also a plus. I got ganged up on by being issued so many mandatory quests, yet I somehow came up on top, so it's pretty balanced. I wish I could play it more though.

Good worker placement game, that can also be used as an introduction to worker placement, and that doesn't need knowledge of D&D to play so anyone can pick it up. Bonus, if you enjoy the setting.

Great family game. 

Fun and can be played in an hour (maybe a bit longer) with experienced folks.

Has surprising amount of tension as resources become scarce and well-played intrigue cards can hinder the best laid plans.

I like uncovering the various abilities of cards that can work together to create nice timing effects. A simple example: using a building to get a face-up quest and completing it in one turn when both spots at Cliffwatch Inn (which give the ability to take a quest card) have been taken.

makes the game more interesting.

I tend to go for super combos and building which in the end is not worth doing (no actual points gained from building typically)

+ Take the DnD theme and pour it into a euro mold; Extremely high quality board and pieces in this game.
- The quests were way too swingy; The hidden roles/objectives are boring at best.


Why it's previously-owned:
I was expecting way too much with this one.  It ended up just being a cube pusher (and a fairly generic one at that) where you were way too dependent on what quests came up for you on your turn.
I traded this away with Roll Through the Ages for Tournay (before it was available in the states).  There are a gazillion worker-placement games that we play instead of this one.

I bought this game hoping that it would be a good substitute for Settlers of Catan, as I have played the heck out of that game and was ready for a change. It was an excellent step up from Catan, while it is still resource management, it also has the awesome lore of D&D to back it up. Some Catan never came close to competing with.

The game-play is relatively simple and easy to pick up, making it an easy game to teach to new players. The artwork is phenomenal, and the D&D themes are incorporated very well into the game. I especially appreciate the variety of cards in this game, whether they be quest or intrigue cards there are very few repeated cards and I have to draw to identical cards in a game. The card variety makes for a a fresh game every time I play. 

My only complaint for this game is that it may be too simple for it to continue to be challenging each game. Otherwise, I loved it.

Solid worker placement.  Very clean and well done.  The theme is pasted on, but it doesn't obscure anything and slightly enhances the game.  I like the quests a lot - they provide a lot of direction.  I wouldn't mind owning this some day - it's good enough that I'd like to play it more.

Lords of Waterdeep is a good worker placement game that shines for its simplicity and ease of play.

The game-play is extremely straight-forward. All you do is gather resources as efficiently as possible and trade them for points. There's very little that deviates from the classic worker placement/resource management game recipe. You can build new locations that allow to take better actions or you can play intrigue cards, that introduce some take-that moments. Both mechanisms increase the player interaction significantly (especially for a title of this genre) and it's for sure one of the biggest strengths of the game.

Yet, even if I consider Lords of Waterdeep to be a fun game, it's not a title I would describe as exciting. It might be the very reason of its success, but the same simplicity and ease of play keep this title from being a great game... at least for me of course. I like it, but I don't find myself thinking about it when the game has been put back in the box. Some worker placement games draw you in with many different strategies and possibilities, other offer difficult choices and a very deep game-play. Those are the worker placement games I love. Lords of Waterdeep is a good game, but I traded cubes for points this time and I will do the same next time I'll play it... just hopefully more efficiently than before.

Therefore I consider Lords of Waterdeep to be a good game and I can see how it's so successful. It's probably a great gateway title for the worker placement genre. It's intuitive to play and offers a lot of interaction... it just isn't as exciting as some other games of this kind. Middle of the road for me.

Superb game. Purchased from Games Lore on 1/4/2014. Played a number of times on the iPad prior to purchasing the board game. UPDATE: beginning to have worries about this somewhat - about the game or my sanity. One lady who is no gamer under any circumstance, has played twice (first two plays and never plays anything else remember) and wins both games handsomely. Why? In the second she accrued a huge number of useless uncompleted Quests and unused Intrigue cards, and STILL won despite all the "wasted" moves. The rest of us are seasoned gamers. Any comments? Let me know.

I enjoyed this game, very simple but competitive, but feels like the theme wasn't really important here, all I thought was: collect purple cubes, white cubes, yellow cubes, black cubes and complete a quest. There is good point of luck here, of course there is strategy and important thinks to do, but luck can screw your game or make you win.

There's nothing wrong with it, exactly.  The theme is entertaining if you have old memories of DMing/playing in Waterdeep (Skullport!  Halaster!  Mirt!), but the game itself is just a clean, well-designed cube accumulator efficiency exercise.  The interaction is limited, not particularly mean, but not very exciting, and there's no "ah, I went with this clever plan" stuff.  If you like D&D and like Agricola/Caylus etc. this might be for you.  Too dull for me.

:cry: :) :D :) :yuk: Too much direct attacking for my taste; an inferior version of Stone Age. Still fun, in small and sporadic doses. Also it takes exactly one hour EVERY TIME, so if you start with this, you'll usually get to play more games after! Another game whose rating baffles me. I mean it's relatively brief, it's simple to teach, and oh yeah, it's also completely mindless, because the best decision is usually obvious even if you're looking at the board from the moon. Not to mention the Ameritrash-style "Eff You" attack cards, which can render any quality strategy useless, and encourage personal vendettas. Between this and Netrunner, I think maybe some people will just rate any old scifi/fantasy game really high. This isn't horrible, but it's just so bland and drab, and I just don't get what makes so many people go completely freaking apetits over manufactured mediocrity.

Elder Signs meets Agricola.

A very light weight worker-placement-action-generating-providing-victory-points-for-winning type of game.

There seem to be no link to the DnD theme. For that matter, it could be a game where grandmothers race for ingredients to cook up home gourmet. 

Did not bothered to look too closely on the beautiful art on each card. Just the necessary resources to give me the victory points. 

Minimum depth that is great to bring non-gamers into these type of worker placement games.

A deeper family game that don't take too much time to complete.

A surprising game. 

Don't get fooled by the cover, this is a rather typical Euro worker/resources management game, dressed up - rather well - in a D&D theme. It's not as tight as most games in the genre, thanks to random objective and action cards. In exchange, it's much for fun and replayable.

It feels a bit weird to be giving a 8 to this game, as I'm not a fan of the genre. But the game just has had that much success around our table. It's easy to learn and quick to play, and ever since I bought it, the box keeps coming off the shelf on a regular basis whenever we want something a bit easy for 4 or 5 players.

I can see why this gets compared to Stone Age often. I enjoy Stone Age, but I like Lords of Waterdeep more. The different intrigue cards, quest cards, buildings, and lord cards offer so much variability from game to game. While it probably plays best with more players, I enjoy it as a two-player game. Now that we have played with the expansion, we plan to always use at least one of the modules from now on, though most likely we will use both. Undermountain gives the same "big money" feel that the Prosperity expansion gave to Dominion...bigger actions, bigger quests, bigger points. Skullport really changes up the game with corruption, another resource to manage, and one that adds even more interaction to the game, as you can affect the consequences of corruption in the game if you want, depending on your own corruption in relation to other players.

Played "Lords of Waterdeep" twice.  Easy to play, nice quality components.  The game itself doesn't work for me.  Place an 'agent' on the board, collect cubes.  Collect enough cubes, turn in for victory points.  That's about it.  Yes, you can buy buildings or play 'intrigue' cards for various effects, but the basic game is as I described it above.

The theme didn't stand out at all.  I didn't feel as though I was hiring buff warriors for a noble quest, I was just collecting little orange cubes because my 'quest' cards said I needed four of them for X amount of VP.  I think I can see how someone could have fun with the game, but I also think it's more hyped up than it should be.  It's not a bad game, it just feels very limited to me.

I'll be selling/trading "Lords of Waterdeep" sooner than later.

A solid and detailed game of city-building, resource management and questing. Being a Dungeons & Dragons game, it has a fantasy flair. It definitely adds excitement for players who are fans of the genre, but it's not too over the top if fantasy isn't your thing.

The board and card artwork is stellar and the game pieces are well done.

It took a group of three of us about a half hour to go through the rulebook and set up then about an hour to play. Very fun and I suspect even more so with 4 or 5 players.

When I first read the rules, I thought, "At last! A worker placement game where the mechanics perfectly marry the theme!" Then I played it. No, the theme is NOT pasted on; but the link between theme and gameplay is certainly looser than it might first appear. This could have been considerably alleviated if minis had been used instead of cubes for the various adventurers, like in Empires:Age of Discovery; but then the retail price would have skyrocketed.
Not that any of that matters: it's a fun game, regardless! The art is great, except for the somewhat bland board. Player interaction is fairly strong....and often cutthroat. Gobs of luck for a worker placement game! Perhaps Lords of Waterdeep is the gateway game to worker placement games?

Absolutely fantastic worker placement game.  There DOES NOT EXIST a more intuitive game in the genre than this right here, it's so easy to learn!

Light but engaging worker placement game. I bought it on a whim with all of the positive buzz surrounding the D&D theme on a Euro game. The fantasy setting does complement the worker placement skeleton nicely. The design is tight and well balanced (except sort of the forced mission attack cards). It's just not that deep of a game.

Great for playing with new players. Base game has gotten a bit meh for me. Definitely improved a bit with more options. I would potentially give the game 7/10 with the expansion. It has really helped keeping the game fresh for me. But I try to reserve playing LoW with new(ish) gamers so I can still enjoy it in small doses and enjoy seeing light bulbs go off in people's heads as they figure out the strategy.

Pros
- Excellent gateway game and accessible 
- Simple, accessible, and the board is intuitive 
- Cool insert
- Halfway through, you get another meeple so the game feels like it ramps up
- Some direct interaction with mandatory quests
- Great decisions to make with scarcity of cubes
- Buildings add variability 
- Hidden scoring done at the end adds tension for endgame
- Low key game for people who do not like direct interaction 

Cons
- The theme is very dry and feels tacked on, but it's fun and accessible enough where that doesn't matter

So I played this once. It's a soulless--but elegantly developed--copycat of mechanisms drawn from better games that's only popular because it's got a great IP slapped onto it. I can't imagine ever thinking, "I want to play Lords of Waterdeep again."

Eventually, I got browbeaten into playing it a second time with the expansion, which makes it barely tolerable.

Serviceable. I find the engine building a little too straightforward and the game too unthematic to really compete against other games.

For worker placement, personally I'd rather play Viticulture or Vanuatu. But for something accessible to new gamers or people who might not be able to take in a bunch of rules, I think that Carcassonne is a more interesting game from a strategic standpoint, more visually appealing, and more space conscious. (Something about the real estate used by Lords of Waterdeep, compared to the abstract play, sort of annoys me. It feels like it should be a cute, abstract game from Japan. Instead, it's a thematic game that got streamlined to hell without cutting down on the board size to match.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Enjoyable little title. Nothing revolutionary, but the mechanics are simple and to the point. I especially like the slow increase of the possibility space, drip feeding buildings into play as it does. The inclusion of 24 buildings in a game where only 7~8 are ever likely to be in play at the same times (and even then for only a round) speaks volumes to its replayability.

After a few games, however, it starts feeling a touch samey. Enjoyable, but not high art.

It is a solid worker placement, and because of its simplicity has a larger mass appeal. I however would have enjoyed this game more if it was drastically more thematic. Instead of getting a warrior cube each time you went to the barracks, you instead drew a warrior card. That card could be worth 1-2 warriors and also have the chance of having other skills or special abilities. 

Everything else this game does, marco polo does better.

Dave Rohrl brought a new copy and recruited me and another 2 new players.  Interesting worker placement, quest completion game.  I ran away with 128pt, due to plot line that award vp for buildings and also plot line awarding extra vp for Piety quest.  I was also holding the Dark Elf and get even more vp at endgame for Piety and Arcane quests.

Upgraded to 8.5 after 2nd game (demo game at Game Kastle).  Very close this time, only won by 2 vp.  This time it was the Paladin with vp for Piety and Warfare quests.  City guard player had a card that allow search of quest deck looking for skulldiggery quest.  This burned up half the deck (of which were of course mostly warefare/piety quest).  Lots of rogue again due to buildings.  The most useful building is Three Pearls that allow covert 2 of any to 3 of any.

From Amazon for $31 on 6/23/12.

RATING: 7
A fun, if simple, worker placement game, with a pasted-on theme of intrigue in D&D's most famous city.  Easy to teach, and I've never played with anyone who dislikes it.

You compete to place your Agents around the city, constructing buildings (and the buildings create a rather interesting subsystem of the game), playing cards, gathering adventurers and gold, and completing quests.

The action cards are the only part of this game I especially dislike, but I can't rate it higher because while I enjoy it, I'd always choose Agricola or Stone Age if I was to play a worker placement game, and LoW doesn't really do anything new.

Comes with dozens of uniquely illustrated cards, wooden agent meeples for each player, and a big pile of wooden cube and cardboard chip resources.  The general aesthetic is consistent, but for a reason I can't quite put my finger on I don't much care for it, though I was never a Forgotten Realms player so maybe there's something I'm missing.

Special note must be made here of the box, for several reasons.  The box insert is fantastic, with room for each type of piece, rather than the sort I've started to see with other publishers which consists of a single large cardboard compartment. As usual for these types of inserts, (and perhaps one of the reasons for the single-compartment inserts) no consideration is made for card sleevers, so a portion of the insert goes unused while the cards slide around under the insert. Such is the life of the obsessive sleever.  The box lid, unlike most other box lids in games today, doesn't extend the whole height of the box.  I'm sure there must be some reason for this beyond just a unique look, but I can't think of what, and it means it tears more easily along the corners and will never stay on if the game is stored sideways.

Yes, I know that the D&D theme is pasted on, but I like to read the flavour text on the cards and pretend this isn't just a simple worker placement, resource gathering and conversion game.  I am being unfair to Lords of Waterdeep.  It is an eminently playable design and I do like how the intrigue cards add touches of unpredictability and take-thatery to throw the perfect planners off their strides.

The artwork is nicely thematic and production quality is decent, although the player chits are rather thin.

This was my first forray into worker placement, and I think it's an amazing gateway into the genre.  Not overly complicated and the components are top notch.  Also, oh my god the insert is the BEST.  Unless you want to store your game on it's side.  Then it's the WORST.

It plays well with myself and the wife.  And plays well with higher player counts.  The strategy changes between the different player counts, so I think there's a fair amount of replayability.

I wish the Lords were a little more varied than "4 VPs for these 2 quest types", but they're going to add more Lord variation with the expansion, so problem solved!

Played this game with some friends and thoroughly enjoyed my first worker placement/euro game. In fact I was really surprised because I had always thought I was not fond of the wooden pieces. BOY WAS I WRONG! 

While I may never own the game myself, I do look forward to more plays!

A great Euro game, with very clear mechanics, easily accessible to beginners but also pleasant for experienced gamers. Fully recommend, rating after 2 plays.

EDIT: Five more plays, with 2,3,4 & 5 players and the rating stays the same. It is a solid game, a bit too easy for my taste, but fully enjoyable. Very good choice if you have 1 hour to play or 1,2 people who are not regular gamers.

A nice euro game with D&D theme. Work perfect in 2 players. In more than 2 is a luck to win, because if your start is good, at least 2 players can play against you... they can see the quests you try to complete and will take all resources that you need, play intrigues and put you to do mandatory quests.

Caylus for the carebears!  Sorta.  This is a great game and I will never turn down a chance to play it, and with the expansion it is starting to get a little meat on its bones.

RATING: 7
July 2013:  Third time playing the game, it seems like the game, at least when played with the existing intrigue cards, has a noteworthy problem.  In particular, the mandatory quest cards seem to invariably cause the player or players who have them played on them, to really dislike the gaming session with this game.  They feel picked upon.  These cards are too powerful, and invariably in our sessions, if played in the closing rounds of the game, lead to glaring king-making problems. (I would assume that playing the game by removing these cards from the intrigue deck would remedy this problem which has plagued the game the three times I have played it.)  

Unfortunately, this conspicuous problem with the mandatory quest cards seems to underscore a broader unease with the game.  When the game is played between very evenly matched players, the final scores are wonderfully close, which generally shows that the designers have balanced the game very nicely.  

However, in this game, such a result raises an uncomfortable question:  did the winner win because everyone gave that much loved player the very small (eg extra cube) "extra benefit" that some intrigue cards provided?  Alternatively, did someone lose by one point because that player happened to have a white cube that was eliminated from their tavern by another player's mindlessly directed intrigue card. In this way, one is left with the uncomfortable feeling that the game was decided by who gave what favor to which player with an intrigue card. In order to restore the connection between game outcome to thoughtful effort, are players supposed to evenly distribute card effects?  

Thus, card play favoritism, randomness, or maliciousness almost seems to decide this game between evenly matched players. From a game design stand point, this is not ideal.

Dropping the rating to a 7 of 10.

May 2012:  First time playing Lords of Waterdeep...I thought it was an excellent, well designed worker placement game that owes much of its inspiration and appeal to mechanics first introduced into the game world by Caylus.  

Lords of Waterdeep overflows with euro gaming style decision making: anticipating other players' actions, engine building, resource management and conversion, rule tweaking card play, play sequencing analysis, turn order considerations, secret goals, and VP condition satisfaction. 

And it does all this within the context of a relatively short game (at least by euro standards) which is nevertheless, satisfying...and that may be it's most impressive game design feat. It packs a lot of gaming punch into a very short game.  Wow, well done.

Is this the best game ever?  Perhaps not, but it is rock solid in design and execution, plus this game is going to introduce a lot of Dungeons and Dragons players (a respectable portion of the 5-8 million people in the world who play D & D) to boardgaming.  And for that reason alone, this game is distinctively good for board gaming and the future of board gaming.  

As I see it, Lords of Waterdeep is likely to make its way into the BGG top 20 very soon, and stay there for quite some time. (A definite early favorite to win the Spiel for games released in 2012, i.e. next year's Spiel.)      

What has Caylus done?  It has spawned a number of new classics like Agricola, Stone Age, Carson City....and now...Lords of Waterdeep.  Welcome to the family...whippersnapper! :p  I give it an 8 of 10.

The game almost lets you forget that, in broad daylight, it is "just" a so-called eurogame. Sometimes you wish your cube shaped warriors and wizards were cool minis, but admittedly the board would get too crowded (never mind your house). The D§D background adds a lot of atmosphere, because Waterdeep means more to you than just a 2d board.

Heavy? No. Thematic? No. Fun? YES. Lords of Waterdeep is another entry into the worker placement genre that successfully meshes strategy, accessibility, and fun. 

The game is really easy to teach, especially since everything is so well labeled on the map - worker spaces let you know how many people can use a building and then they clearly show what you can do in there.

Plays fast and is both light enough for new 'gamers' to enjoy and strategic enough for 'gamer-gamers' to get into as well.

RATING: 9
With some minor houseruling (and with expansion gives even more varierty), this is the best gateway worker placement (far better than Stone Age, no dice here). Maybe even best WP (it beats overrated Keyflower) And maybe even best gateway in general. It have been the favourite game of my group with 100+ plays, and we never seem to get bored with it yet.

The only con is the theme, which is laughable for an euro and may detract potentional gamers. But luckily there is no miniatyres here.

Being a huge Forgotten Realms guy myself, I love the Waterdeep setting. The game is good, solid fun and I have yet to meet the person who would sit the game out. The components and insert are fantastic. I haven't decided which one I like better though, this or Manhattan Project. I lean towards MP a bit more I think, but LoW is definitely the more popular of the two.

RATING: 7
A lot like Caylus, though it'll appeal to different crowds because it has a lot more randomness and a bit more theme.  Isn't as much of a brain-burner as Caylus, though if anything there's more going on in Lords of Waterdeep - the big difference is the sequencing in Caylus which really forces you to plan further ahead.  That element is mostly missing in Waterdeep.

 This is one of our favorite worker placement games. With its easy game play and top rate quality components it should be near the top of everyone's list. But we will say one thing about it. Let's be honest. The D & D theme is pasted on. Don't get us wrong it is still an awesome game despite that. But we have to disagree with certain people (Richard Ham. we're talking to you) who believe this game can get RPGers into board games. We have been part of die hard RPG groups in the past and there is no way they'd consider this D & D. Reasonably certain they would all just look at us in a very cross manner were we to even suggest such a thing.

Artwork and components are great. Mechanics is fluent and very intuitive. We played it three and the victory was uncertain until the end.

I liked it very much and I'm keen on playing it again and again.

RATING: 9
This isn't a difficult game, but it is an elegant one.  It combines the atmosphere of D&D in a nostalgic location (I used to adventure in waterdeep years ago) anda Euro style gameplay (resources & no dice).  This game is letting me approach non boardgaming RPGers with a great game and we are all having fun.  I have only owned the game for two weeks and we have 4 full plays and 1 partial (teaching) under our belts already.  (Having won 3 of these, you can see why I like it :) )

Not a bad game to play, but the theme is pretty irrelevant. Why did it have to be medieval/D&D? The answer is it didn't, except that the D&D theme will sell more games. I don't feel cheated--it's a decent game--it's just not a thematically medieval game.

One play, 5P.  D&D-themed Caylus, essentially.  Inclined to think that 3P is the sweet spot for my tastes, because I found the downtime almost entirely uninteresting.  That's usually not the case for me with worker placement, because I'm concerned about contention, but with this game there always seemed to be so many outs (buildings to let you re-use other spots, cards that let you re-use other spots, plot quests that let you re-use other spots, cards that can provide the same thing you need, duplication of needs on buildings, etc.).  Enjoyed it still, and would play again.  Oh, also disappointed with the sameyness of the Lords - although I'm sure I prefer it to grossly unbalanced asymmetry.

Some folks have spoken poorly of the theme, but I thought the theme worked out well. The one thing that would have helped would have been some greater variety in bulding functions. The game tends to descend to figuring on the most efficient exchange rate for adventurers.  The notion that you have to benefit one other player slightly for more intrigue cards was neat. It provides internal balancing since you'd try and give it to someone who would benefit least from it.  I'd say it's about the best entry-level euro for most people who might be leery. Settlers is too random for me. Ticket to ride is go-fish. This game is the basics in an approachable fantasy theme.

Outstanding...WOTC has a gem here!
Dungeons & Dragons theme on a strong euro based mechanic game. Game play is similar but not the same as caylus due to the intrigue cards. It adds a conflict dynamic i have not seen in other worker placement games that really adds tension and proper planning to accomplish ones goals.

It might be a little foolish to call this one of the best Euros I've played due to the Forgotten Realms theming, but it just might be...having those hidden Lord roles and all the quests and such really makes this more fun than your usual Victory Point track game, and even thrilled me as a long time fan of the lore/setting.

NOTE: This is probably the ONLY game I'm rating as a package WITH the expansion, because I find the Corruption track and the new buildings that integral. For base LoW, drop a point, but don't play it that way, trust me!

This was my go to worker placement game for a while, but has been dethroned by Champions of Midgard. It has some solid worker placement rules, but the theme is almost forgettable. It's a thin veneer on a very mechanical game. I like theme, so I deducted 2 stars as a result.

Most overrated game I've seen here. Bland, boring and uninspired. There is not a single reason to play this game. Simple ressources, forced player interaction (though barely noticable) and not singe good design idea. I can't shake of the feeling this was the result of a 10 min board game design contest ... and not the winning entry. 

It saddens me how the D&D license is enough to make it successful, there are a million other games that deserve it more.

I had a lot of negative preconceptions about this game going into my first play.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The depth surprised me, given its reputation as a gateway game.  And regarding the theme, which many have called "pasted on".  Well, I guess I love hoarding colored cubes so much that I didn't care.

After one play at 3p, it does seem that there is a slightly excessive luck factor, particularly due to the intrigue cards.  For example, the 'sample wares' card allowed me to get 10 rogue cubes, which no one prevented because of course they didn't know I had that card...  However, through dogged blocking, mandatory quests, etc., another player managed to close the gap, which imo is a testament to the game's interactivity.  I love games that let you slap down a runaway leader.

The waterdeep harbor mechanism was a standout feature of the design, allowing you to postpone your turn in order to play a card.

Love this game. Great worker placement game. I have minor balance issues but then again I don't have enough plays to determine whether or not that is full on true. The variance incorporated into the game via the quest hall I feel can be just right to crazy random. Still though, great game.

I love comparing it to Agricola which is my most played WP game. LoW has done several things better than Agricola despite being a more gateway WP game:
- Much more player interaction
- Clear cut currency values
- Accessibility to newbies of WP
- Variability in starting condition
- New players that have some experience in WP actually have a chance at beating experienced players

The theme is horrible though.

Doesn't do anything 'new', but one of the most polished games I've played in recent years.  Don't be fooled by the name or 'D&D' branding - this is a great worker placement game that could easily be called 'Councillors of Toronto'.  

Great fun, and fairly easy to sink one's teeth into.

I'm usually not one to like Euro-worker-placement, so I imagine my score would be higher if I were a fan of it.

This isn't too bad though. The production value is nice and high, everything is fairly pretty, and it seems like there's a fair bit of screwage as well. I think I might like Dominant Species a little better for worker placement, but I don't think Dominant Species translates as well to two player.

RATING: 4
The meat and potatoes of the worker placement genre. Rudimentary economy, overpowered gotcha cards, an overabundance of randomness and excessive downtime between actions with a high player count put this game low on the list of worthwhile worker placers. The game also seems to have more turns than is needed - by the end of the game, the various virtuous and vicious cycles are irreversible. It's often recommended as an introductory WP game, but I'd say it's dullness argues very strongly against it.

RATING: 5
This is I think the highest ranked game I've played that didn't do much for me. I felt I was playing a game solo, just that other players were simultaneously playing the same solo game. I got on with my quests, sometimes other players might get in my way but I think that was accidental not tactical. In this sense, the lack of player interaction reminded me of Ticket to Ride. I rated that 5.5 and am rating this lower because at least with TtoR you sense you are building railway lines, with LoW deep I had no feeling of sending people on quests. In fact, it is so abstract that it was halfway through the game before I bothered asking what the different coloured cubes represent (answer: it doesn't matter). Nice board though. 
Just to be fair, I should point out I've only played once and had a cold so was feeling a bit jaded.

RATING: 7
A gorgeous production, but the game-play felt a little shallow to me.  While the art was great and the world was well realized, I think at the end of the day I'm more of a Caylus guy (for worker placement) or a Mage Knight guy (for cheesy fantasy).

Still this bare bones, fantasy themed euro, is easy to teach, easy to learn, and a solid game to keep around when younger or newer gamers come 'round.

RATING: 8
Enjoying this worker placement game a lot and I'm not a D&D fan and that works just fine. However I played the other day with D&D fanboys and they were totally into the names of quests and Waterdeep. So to conclude it's a great euro worker placement - don't let the theme put you off and if it's your thing I suspect you'll love it even more.

RATING: 9
Played loads of games - about an equal amount of 2p & 3p, with a few 5 and six players.  All very good, but subtly different and interesting experiences.

We like worker placement games (Notre Dame, Stone Age, et al), this one differs by having a stronger and more direct 'take that' element, though it is not overpowered, nor too confrontational.  

It's nice to have a well designed and produced worker placement game that provides this.  

I'm not a massive D&D fan (I played with the red/blue boxed sets, many, many years ago) but it's nice to have a compelling theme - it makes a change from the somewhat dry subject matter many worker placement games explore.

Kíváncsi voltam, mit tud 2012 egyik sikerjátéka... Röviden: butított Caylus kártyákkal.

Ha nem ismerném a Caylust, jobban tetszene, de azért így sem volt vészes. Akárcsak a Caylusban, ugyanúgy itt is van pár fix épület, és építhetünk is saját épületeket, amit ha más használ, ugyanúgy kapunk érte jutalmat. Más worker placement játékból is találhatunk ismerős elemeket, de végül is jól össze van gyúrva. Ami plusz, azok a kártyák: van egy titkos küldetéskártya mindenkinek (=játékvégi pontok), plusz folyamatosan megoldhatunk küldetéseket (~nyersanyagok GYP-re és egyéb előnyökre váltása), illetve vannak intrika kártyák is. Ez utóbbiek kicsit feldobják a játékot, és az egyik épület szerepét jelentősen felértékelik (~ Caylusban a kapu felel meg ennek az épületnek, ahonnan a kör végén még meglévő üres helyekre helyezhető át a bábu, csak itt már előtte egy kártya is kijátszásra kerül). Ez az intrika rész visz egy kis konfrontációt a játékba, erősen magában hordozva a királycsinálás lehetőségét is.

A tematika egyáltalán nem jött át. Következetesen nyersanyagokról beszélek, végig így emlegettük, hogy beváltok 2 piros és 3 fehér kockát. Holott hivatalosan ha jól emlékszem: 2 harcos és 3 pap... Aki el tudja magával hitetni, hogy az a kis kocka valójában pap, és akinek ezáltal gondolom tematikus is a játék, annak irigylem a fantáziáját, szerintem semmivel se tematikusabb, mint a Caylus:)

Összességében: könnyedebb és rövidebb, mint a Caylus, ha valakit nem merünk leültetni Caylusozni, annak mutassuk meg helyette ezt:) Ha pedig ez tetszik neki, akkor utána jöhet a Caylus.

Ja egy hátrányt kifelejtettem: nyelfgüggő! A doboz elég különleges, a tábla puritán de nekem tetszik (mondjuk nekem a Troyes is tetszik:))

Egyébként 3-an teljesen más volt, mint 4-en, 4-en valahogy kevesebb választási lehetőség volt, 3-an én elvesztem a sok lehetőség között. Megfigyelésünk: kártyákra kell menni, épületek közül csak néhányat éri meg megépíteni.
---
Majd két év elteltével újra előkerült. Tetszik-tetszik, de valahogy túl mechanikus, hogy mit kell csinálni. Veszem el a célokat, gyűjtögetem hozzá a pénzt meg a kiskockákat (akik tudom emberek:)), és váltogatom be... Semmi olyan komolyabb dilemmát nem látok, mint a Caylusban, hogy mondjuk a várat építsem-e, vagy mennyire menjek rá a kegyekre, stb...

This is a good worker placement game, in the vein of Caylus.  The theme fits very well, and allows for some randomness with the questing option.  Will need more plays, but I think it could stay fresh as a result (and with expansions).  One thing I wasn't so fond of was the random quests at the start -- it seemed that could give you a significant advantage, depending on the lord you were playing or the point value of the cards...it almost seemed like there should be an auction for the starting quests.

Lords of Waterdeep qualifies as a light-to-medium euro game, with the novel aspect of being set in the D&D world of the Forgotten Realms.
The designer chose to add some player interaction (apart from the usual "I take that spot that you truly need" interaction level of every worker placement game...) in the form of Intrigue cards.
The game feels quite straightforward, with the completing of quests as a rather direct way of turning resources (adventurer cubes) in victory points.
Lords of Waterdeep lacks the depth of many favorite euros: there's no real deep choices (like building an engine vs making fast points), but everything is so smooth that it plays fast and don't overstays its welcome.
Rating after the first three plays (with 2, 5 and 4 players) is a 7.5.

Update, august 25th, 2013: after more than a year, I find myself returning to the game and enjoying it a lot (it is the to go light worker placement game), so the rating goes up to 8.

Didn't really like it the first time I played but it has since grown on me.  I was looking for a light worker placement game to play with my wife and an emerging group of gamers.  Stone Age is OOP and Belfort is pricey and maybe a bit much for this group to start.  The more I thought about it, Waterdeep seemed to be the answer.

Fun game, and a great production from WotC as well.  The play-time is just right, the game scales well, is easy to teach and looks great to boot.  I would much rather play this than a longer, drier worker placement Euro.  I like that there is some hidden info and a dab of take that card play.  Just enough chaos to inject some fun, and I think that most games will still be close affairs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Simple worker placement that can be easily learned by people unfamiliar with the mechanism. Plays fast, too. I look forward to integrating the Skullport expansion after a few more plays, as I want more complexity than the base game offers.

Edit, Sept 2017: Finally played Skullport. The Skullport module is a welcome addition and bumps the rating of the game up a bit. Undermountain is not as good as Skullport.

I played my first game with my roommates and neighbor, and it was all of their first worker placement game. It is light enough to be a gateway worker placement game and you complete quests quickly enough to feel that you're making tracks quickly. There isn't much of an 'engine' feel to it because the buildings that you build are the only option of that, and most of the time they didn't use the buildings. Will play again and try to bring more into the fold!

Pretty much what I expected it to be - Caylus Lite. The interesting decisions are stripped away, and a layer of chrome is added.

This is probably one of the best, if not THE best worker placement game I've ever played. The theme could be better, it's ok-ish for D&D fans but everyone else it will feel pasted on.

I HIGHLY recommend to buy it with the expansion from the get-go.

RATING: 7
First play: A very clean and straightforward game to explain. Few if any fiddly rules and we launched in after 20 mins which included set up time. 

A rinse and repeat experience over 8 rounds the game ticks over with players trying to add to their scores by improving on basic abilities, by completing special quests or increasing their income by buying buildings that offer additional actions and payment to the shop owner.

Not quite short enough to be a filler but a very simple mechanic and strong nostalgia for those with a D'n'D background. Not a game I'd buy but I'd be happy to play again.

Second Play: Ditto the above. Strangly I was given the 'Collect buildings' again Lord card and won (again) by a country mile after collecting 9 buildings and scooping an extra 54 points. Maybe worth removing this card?

Solid worker placement game. This and Stone Age would be my go-to introductory games for the genre but ones that even seasoned gamers would enjoy. The variability is reasonably high since the kinds of quests and buildings that come out will be different every game. In the end, it's a pretty straight forward gather-resources-and-convert-them-to-points Euro but the various quests, buildings and cards present a different puzzle to solve each game. Bonus points for good component quality and a nice box insert.

Fantastic game, and may be in my Top 5 for awhile. I enjoy the focused strategy of completing quests more so than the open game play of other worker-placement entries. Am a big fan of the iOS version as well. My only complaint is the game board being prone to warping. I'm on my second.

One of the all time great worker placement games, with a D&D theme! There is so much to like in this game. The building mechanic is great as you get VP or people or money as people use your buildings. Also, the secret Lord card can be the turning point in a close game. Finish those quests that they want you to finish! Beautiful components, easy gameplay, great theme. IMO, most people should have this in their collection if they consider themselves a gamer.

A fun resource management game - feels a bit stuffy with 5 players (i.e., choices limited depending on turn order due to limited areas initially available). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I liked this more actually playing it then I did when I first did a run through on my own. You can really foil a guys plans with a well played intrigue card - which is the major difference here between this and other worker placement games. Other than that wholly derivitive. Not a single unique mechanism in the whole game.

Its too bad I am totally burned on worker placement or I'd've liked this more. If I only owned three worker placements this would be one of them:

Agricola
Caylus
Lords of Waterdeep
...possibly alien frontiers. but thats it!...and glen more? too many good games.

I really wish this had come out before stone age. To think of all the worker placement fatigue i got from that game when I could have been playing this.

Fun, lots of different strategies, easy for people to pick up.  However, strategies are obvious and every game in the worker placement genre really just feels the same.

EDIT: I bumped this up a point because it has actually hit the table a lot recently with various play groups and has met with success all-around.  The worker-placement genre is one of the biggest in designer board-gaming and this game serves as a perfect intro to that genre and is extremely accessible but still maintains a pretty decent level of strategy.

Man, what a difference a little theme makes.  And by "A little," I mean "Vast glorious treasure chests stuffed with."  Remove the Dungeons and Dragons elements and you're left with a good-but-not-great worker-placement Euro.  But with them -- and note that they only require a basic understanding of fantasy RPG archetypes to make sense -- a damn fun story emerges.  Gather up adventurers, send them out on missions to do your bidding, look for ways to screw your neighbors out of doing the same.  Good times.

Concerns (from IOS to IRL): 
- Too long for what it offers
- Theme would be just a little too thin for live-action play.  As an app the theme makes the app a bit more enjoyable when I'm in the mood for a fantasy-based adventure

The thin vainer of theme bothers me a little.  The game play is solid though and makes up for it immensely.  A work placement game with some direct player interaction by using intrigue cards.

Family game rating.

Have the DnD Painted Custom Meeples, Skull Upgrade kit, upgraded coins and the larger DnDeeples that replace the caravan tokens.

A light medium worker placement game that has a place in my collection for family game nights. It is easily explained, doesn't overstay it's welcome (plays rather quickly) and holds your attention for what it is. 

Yes, the Mandatory quests can add a randomness and screwage factor, but it brings out the theme and flavor. Take it for what it is and have fun with it.

I'm not a DnD guy, but the artwork and theme are great and having the DnD painted custom meeples enhances the experience. 

I'm looking forward to seeing what the expansion adds.

If pre-calculus is required before calculus, then Lords of Waterdeep is pre-Caylus. Or Caylus for dummies. Or Caylus for people that aren't hardcore gamers. The mechanics were simple to pick up, but allowed for some decent depth. A few of the cards/quests are overpowering (one plot quest lets you play on an occupied space and another grants you an additional agents). In most cases, the players with these benefits have won the game despite being delayed by Mandatory Quests and the like. Overall a good mid-complexity game for players of all depths.

Someone slapped a DnD theme into a Euro style worker placement game. It came out as probably my favorite worker placement game and with a theme that will probably appeal to most gamers versus more traditional Euro themes like farming, port managing, etc. Once you have this, you can skip buying any future worker placement games unless they bring something new to the table (like Five Tribes).

I really enjoy the combination of Euro worker placement mechanics (including the harbor twist), American take-that mechanics (Intrigue cards), and the hidden role mechanic (Lords/target quests).  Building and quest variety provides plenty of replay, and the building ownership bonus makes extending the game board worthwhile.  Very nice blend, very accessible, quick to play, and fun.  Theme is great, so much happier with this than planting seeds, raising sheep, or trading stone and barley.  Questing FTW!  They're rogues, clerics, fighters, and wizards dammit.  Not cubes.  :)

Fun worker placement game.  At least tries to deal with the problem  of being unable to attack other players in these types of games by having nuisance quests you can force them to complete.  Of course, many of the idiots on this site cry if you play one on them and it costs them the game because they couldn't complete a big quest, which is the POINT OF THE CARD.  Don't be like them.  Don't ban these or house rule them.  Just man up.

Sometimes you don't have to be innovated to be good.  This game strips away the fat of most worker placement games, adds some mean card play, special abilities and random buildings to keep it all fresh.  Don't call them orange and purple cubes...they're fucking fighters and wizards.  Great game that only gets better with the expansion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Not a bad game, but in my opinion just a D&D re-skin of a worker placement game.  Any theme could be thrown on top of the mechanics.

So if you are a huge fan of the setting or like worker placement games and don't mind having multiple ones that work similarly it might be for you, otherwise you might want to play it before buying it to make sure it's not too similar to other games.

// This game was a favorite until we started playing other,
more thematic, worker placement games. I think it'll always
keep a spot in our collection, but it's just so difficult
to make it feel like there's more going on beyond the rote 
collecting of cubes and turning them in for more cubes. 
Not to mention trying to get people to not call them white/
orange/black/purple cubes in the first place is a struggle.
This game would probably be improved quite a bit with an
upgrade to those components to make it feel more 
thematic.

Loved it, although I failed utterly when I played it. It came with the Skullport expansion and that adds SO much depth, I wouldn't want to play it without it. A shame that it doesn't have a publisher in Germany yet AND a shame that the cards are so thin. I hope for a second edition with upgraded material!

RATING: 5
Rating based on about 6 two player games with my gf. The game was simply too easy and boring. I must add that we practically didn't use the backstab Intrigue cards as we don't like such mechanics in games. I don't get people suggesting this so much as a 2 player game. Since this was compared to Stone age so many times I actually decided not to buy this one as well. Thankfully this one was rented and returned relatively fast.

A game that clicked with us. I don't think it's a great 'game' in the sense that it's dry as hell and doesn't really do a great deal that's interesting, but it flows really nicely and it's a great game to play late at night whilst catching up with friends. If it were music, it'd be late night jazz...

Nothing new here. Same tired old euro mechanics that we have seen over and over. I don't care too much about theme, but this game attempts to use D&D in the most pathetic way. Character classes are resource cubes. Seriously!? My guess is those that rate this game high have played very few games so they are easily impressed, or they are just die hard D&D fanboys that like anything with that printed on it.

5 player game.  I like worker placement.  Was competitive with two players to have a chance to win.  7th round I picked up a 25 point quest which really the only way I had a chance, barely to win.  The end of round 7 I had 2 mandetory questions placed on me.  I don't have a problem with 1 being played as it does slow you down.  But, 2 in a row was a crushing blow that was unrecoverable in round 8.  I don't mind screwage buy boy two mandatory quests in a row was not fun.  I feel that there should be a limit of one at a time to be played.  The worst part was that I wouldn't have won with the 25 pt quest.  Should have some way to remove these.  Good game otherwise.  Without this kind of ending play I would rate as a 8 to 8.5.  I smell an expansion to have a way to nullify this.  Maybe bank some type of tokens (insurance in invest in) through the game to allow you to pay off without have them count as one of your quests for a turn.

VERY fun game!  I realize it is a D&D themed cube-pusher, but I LOVE THAT!  I love the added segregation and luck-of-the-draw elements of the Quest deck.  I like the limited availability of the buildings and the escalating VP accumulation on those available for build.  I even like that some of the Intrigue cards are MUCH better than others.  It all boils down to a FUN game... definitely not as optimally balanced and strategic as Caylus, but way more fun!  I can't wait to pick up a copy of this game and play with Mark and Harry.

In fact, my impression of this game just displaced Caylus in my list of 10's.  Now _THAT'S_ something!

I like this, and I'm generally willing to play it, but I'm not particularly good at playing it. That's not an issue with a fun group, but with a more staid group it can feel a bit like waiting to lose.

I really like the worker placement mechanism used, and although luck can make it swing a bit, I do like the theme a lot. I backed the character meeples Kickstarter to give me fancier meeples for this, and I've never regretted it.

This game is a wonderful gateway to multiple game mechanics.  It will appeal to your friends who like property owning games, it has quest completion for those who like instant gratification, it offers an excellent introduction to the worker placement style of gaming, for your friends who like to mess with everyone else; intrigue cards will be their directional choice, and lastly, it has a D&D theme.  Probably about the most universal game in my library.

RATING: 7
This essentially replaced Stone Age for me. It's a light Euro with easy little optimization decisions. It's definitely not a brain burner and the level of immersion isn't high. The theme is the thinnest of frosting (the fact that I do like fantasy themes helps a little) that wears off quickly. It's got a little "take that" and a little VP chasing and a little strategy. It seems like a good selection when you have about an hour and want something pleasant but not consuming; my favorite review of LoW called it "mostly harmless." I am glad to have it in my collection for these occasions.

Counting cubes in different colours, memorizing the cubes you need, than counting the cubes the other players need, then calculating the actions they will take, then deriving your high priority actions, then doing those actions isn't a game but just bookkeeping. A bad design, because too much can be derived. Also: Why are there take-that mechanics in a cube counting game? To force you to recount! Hurray that's fun!

Played this at a board game meet and considered buying. It's a lot of fun. My only worry is that I have an astounding love for Alien Frontiers, and do I really need another worker placement game. I certainly think I wouldn't like the game as much without the expansions. I look forward to playing this again though, hopefully I will even increase my score. Update: now that I've played more worker placement games, it would take a lot more to talk me into playing this game and it would require the skullport expansion.

A good game, but a tad boring for me. I do not get all the hype, there are WAY better worker placement games than this. I must give credit to this as it was my first euro-styled game and introduced me to a new genre that I had been avoiding. Perhaps it should get props for being a great gateway game, but alas that is ALL it is to me. Do not own this and likely never will, so dust control is moot on this one.

Like it quite a lot.  This is the first real worker placement game I have played and am looking forward to playing with more players.  There is not much competition for spaces in the two player game unless you are both playing for the same quest types.  i can see how playing 4 or 5 player will really open up the strategy for resources.

RATING: 7
Gentle worker placement game with a thin veneer of theme (helps if the players refer to the resources as clerics, fighters, wizards etc, rather than white, orange or purple cubes!)

Mandatory quests are the oddity, here - fine in a 2 player game with more than that getting them sucks, no real help to you for playing them, and one player gets irritated. Usually I remove them.

Selfmade Board and Box, cards & buildings, Adventurer-stones and meeples in a rich retheme starring in: LORDS of WESTEROS. The story of A Game of thrones fits perfect to L.o.W. with all its alliances and intrigeous habits of the struggling factions.
The acting factions are Baratheon, Greyjoy, Lannister, Stark and Tyrell. The Lieutenant is Brienne of Tarth and the Ambassdor is played by grown up girl Cat of Canals (aka. Arya Stark). Credits for his beautiful and marvelous artwork goes to SteveMcKenzie(Epicurean), which has made a intrigeus Game of thrones all possible. It took me around 20 hours of printing, work and searching for the game cubes, meeples and card board, but then i done it and now i´m sufficient.

This, along with Pandemic and Viticulture, are currently my "holy trinity" of games. Which basically means that these are the games I'm ALWAYS down to play. LoW is a fast, breezy entry into the worker placement genre. While the theme may run a little thin (it can easily turn into, "I will now turn in these cubes to gain victory points"), if you allow yourself to be immersed into the world of LoW, the game becomes supremely more fun.

Things I love about the game:
- Intrigue cards range from mildly annoying to extremely helpful, keeping every round fresh and exciting.
- There is no "one way" to play the game. Wanna buy a bunch of buildings? Go for it. Wanna focus on simply completing quests for victory points? The option's open.
- A novice player always stands a chance against a more experienced player.

Things I don't like so much:
- While the different role cards try to add an element of asymmetry to the game, every role card in the base game is basically the same. Skullport alleviates that, but only if you're willing to pay $30 more.
- Some of the building and quest actions are WAY overpowered. For example, one quest allows you to have an extra agent for the rest of the game. In a two player game, this action alone tilts the scales WAY too drastically.

All in all, LoW is a great game. It plays fast, allows you to employ strategy to your liking, and generally speaking gives everyone a chance to win.

A worker placement game with a twist to it.
The intrigue cards let you interact with the other players in a nice way. Hostile but not to much to put you off.
The amount of buildings that exists give the game a high replayability. It also gives a change in strategy.

This game is so good and one of my all time favorites. With the expansion this game is easily a 10 for me. Even the base game gives you tons of replay value with the different lords, the different quests and how they feel to play, the variation of how to achieve certain strategies it's just a fantastic game. There is something very simple and elegant about the board and mechanic design that is very pleasing to play through. I am becoming a big worker placement fan and this is my favorite worker placement that I have played so far. I have Caverna on the way so that may change but right now I'm in love with this game after over 20 plays. The intrigue cards add so much depth and complexity and can really mess with an opponent's strategy. If you see this game absolutely buy it. The value you get for the $40 to $50 dollars is so much more than many other games at higher price points. An easy buy for me and one of my top 5 games ever.

Ordered from Book Depository on 2013-04-29 for €35.71

Sleeved with Mayday Games Ultra-Snug Almost-a-Penny Card sleeves (2 5/8" x 3 5/8") so the cards still fit in the insert.

Was previously sleeved with Arcane Tinmen 63x88mm sleeves. But then the cards didn't fit in the insert.

Its a fun and easy game. Chris and Vinny enjoyed it, but the randomness of the lord cards and quest cards is starting to bug me. The building randomness I don't mind quite as much, but I added a house rule where everyone gets 2 lord cards from which they choose 1. It helps make it less annoying.

RATING: 7.5
Fairly light euro worker placement game. Nothing ground breaking in terms of mechanics but it's all fairly solid. I think I'd like it more if the theme were a little more prevalent: the fighters, clerics, etc., you recruit are strictly 'resources'. It would be very very easy to rebrand this game into a typical middle-ages trading or commerce game. Still though, pretty fun and not a huge time sink even with 5 people.

04/08/2013: Played with 4 people, more fun. Bumped to 7.5. 

04/04/2014: Well here I am a year later bumping it back down to a 7. Still a 'good' game but definitely not in the upper tier.

03/27/15: First play in a year. Good fun. Back up to 7.5. Predicting bumping it down to a 7 this time next year based on an emerging pattern seen in my comments above.

Another game combining familiar elements, but does so in a crisp way and with a new theme. Competition for resources is at just the right level. If you find yourself short of acquiring them, then Intrigue cards can help out. Neat element with Intrigue cards allows for a late attempt at another action to make up for action, in player order. Seems very well balanced overall. Only complaint is why the Quest cards come up randomly with the wide variation of victory points, instead of in stages. Need to grab these early when they appear and hang on to them until they can be paid for, even though it might seem like wasting a precious action. UPDATE: Bumped down one point after second play. Seems that building a building may not be a good strategy, as others will use it before yourself, even though you get a small payment for it. Have to play again to see how it balances. UPDATE: Expansion enhances play tremendously.

I am usually all for theme, but not even the D&D chrome can hide this is a pretty ordinary worker placement game. In terms of complexity, this is on par with Stone Age (i.e. too basic for my current taste in games). I also disliked the seemingly unbalanced intrigue cards and the randomness of the quests. Overrated.

A good balance between a euro (worker placement, coloured cube collecting) and AT (intrigue cards). Nothing overly original but it comes together as a decent 90 minute game. There's absolutely no theme here despite the heavy attempt in the rulebook to inject one. This is a virtually an abstract game.

After 5 plays, there's not much left to explore.

A truly wonderful game. The game plays very smoothly and everything seems to get used and work well together. Clearly the product of a lot of care and attention. The rules are simple, and the game is very easy to jump in to with only a quick read of the rules.

The components are excellent, too, and I think of no game with better storage.

The D&D setting really does add to it, as it gives everything an immersive (and, to many, familiar) flavour.

I was introduced to this one in a four-player session with a historically dominant player who did indeed pull out a comfortable win.

For some reason I just have no desire to play LoW after my first 6 or so games. Still, as a low difficulty WP game with nice components, it has a spot in my collection. I just wish the box was more of a standard size.

RATING: 9
This game is the poster child for "more than the sum of its parts."  The theme in this game is completely pasted on - it is a standard cube collection and efficiency worker placement Euro.  You can build buildings, and there is a mild take-that element, but basically you collect cubes to fulfill orders (er, "quests"), score points, rinse, repeat.  And yet... the game is incredibly fun to play.  The components are a treat, and the gameplay is buttery smooth.  In fact, this might be the gateway worker placement game bar none (eat it, Stone Age).  And while simple to play, it does have variety, as the buildings provide extra action opportunities, but likely only eight or so will get built in any one game.  So, strategies will shift based on what's available (and also based on what type of quests are being collected for endgame scoring).  The game scales very well.  There's really no reason not to get this one, unless you're looking to flay a litch or something...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Lords of Waterdeep is a beautiful game. It's a cube-pusher, yes, but with the DnDeeples, the game feels like it's more than just a collection, but rather does feel like it harbours the mystery and intrigue that the game advertises. A great pickup and I don't regret it in the slightest.

RATING: 7.5
Easy little Euro, almost like a kid's version of Agricola with a D&D theme. I can see why people hate it for its simplicity, but come on, it's not like Agricola is rocket science. I hope the expansion adds some much-needed complexity to the gameplay.

It's good, it's breezy.  I'm not sure what the ideal number for this game is, but it's not 2, and it doesn't feel like it's 5.  I need to play it with 4 and see how that strikes me. It has theme, but it's a bit pasted on, though they did a better job than other euros do.

RATING: 7
A faster and simpler Caylus.  Adds some random elements (intrigue cards, quest cards order) that can result in interesting situations.  Good for what it is, but I would rather play Caylus (or Stone Age or Tribune).  The D&D theme is completely superfluous, so don't let that stop you from trying it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I like this game less every time I play it.  See below for a more positive initial impression, from when I rated the game a 7.

The game feels like it has no room for strategy and is dominated by luck in card draw.  If you can't get quests of your type, you have little chance of winning.  For most of the game, the decisions are extremely easy: what is the scarcest available resource you need for your quests?  Get it.

Sure, there is a bit of strategy about when to acquire quests, build buildings and in which order to complete things.  But it feels like drops in the bucket.

The game doesn't have any significant problems - it's easy to teach and quick to play.  I just don't like it.

-------

This is a great introductory worker-placement game.  I think it makes a better introduction than Stone Age, even.  And I like it enough to have picked up the "DnDples" that a BGG user is making. :)

That said, I don't think it's a fantastic game.  Quite a bit seems to be determined by luck.  Do you starting quests align with your Lord?  Did someone else get the quest that gives them an extra player early?  Do you have the Piety/Commerce Lord but no extra cleric or money buildings have come out?

It's a fun game to play, but I'm not sure there are enough tough, strategic decisions.

Typical worker placement. Turn actions into cards and cubes, then turn cards and cubes into victory points, with the occasional stepping on toes by taking the action somebody else wanted. Mostly harmless. Also mostly boring. The expansion that adds corruption makes it almost sufferable.

RATING: 9
Impressed. Plays really cleanly and smoothly, without grit. This is what a worker placement game should look like. Not a dynamic or dramatic game, but a lot of legitimate choices and well-done flavor coupled with an elegant design.

There is probably more chaos here than you might think, just from the feel of the game - plot quests with good powers can be swingy, intrigue cards can be strong or not at the right time or not, and there is some random screwage at times. So it's not a game you'd want to play for blood. But it works and is fun and I can add it to Pillars of the Earth and Tribune as worker placement games that actually work for me.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A good introductory-level worker placement game, but I'm not sure it's really of much use beyond that.

Basically, Lords of Waterdeep strips the worker placement genre down to a very simple level.  Almost every available action space is to get yourself cubes (which represent clerics and other typical fantasy band members) or money.  You then turn in those things in for points (fulfilling quests).

Borrowing from Caylus, players can also build buildings, which are new action spaces players can use to get cubes and money, but also give their owner a bonus when used.

And since this is a D&D property after all, of course the game had to have a more Ameritrashy element to it!  There are three action spaces you can use to play special cards from your hand, many of which are of a "take that" variety, some of which are rather game breaking, frustrating, and un-fun.  I actually think the base game mechanics are solid (I guess they kind of have to be since everything here is directly borrowed from other games, and then simplified), but the "take that" cards are pretty annoying.

Some how, some way, this is a completely generic worker placement game that has won over a lot of the Ameritrash crowd, which I really find incredibly entertaining.  The game is straight up "get cubes and money, make a set, cash in for victory points" and almost nothing more, but slap D&D on it, and voila!  Ah, gotta love it.

Overall, while I don't think it's a great game, Lords of Waterdeep is a very valuable game to the gaming community as a solid intro to a popular game genre.  The simplicity is probably good in this case, as I assume the game is appealing toward the RPG sector who may be more unfamiliar with this style of game.  However, as a gamer, I only found it mildly interesting, mainly having utility as a gateway game into the more interesting worker placement games.

The components are outstanding. I love the theme of being a Lord and basically building an NPC village for heroes to visit and find quests. Each Lord has a different way to score victory points at the end of the game, and is hidden from the rest of the players, so it can be a lot of fun to try to guess which player has which lord based on the strategy they are using. I would have rated this higher, but I found it similar to Dungeon Petz in playstyle and prefer the mechanics and theme in that game to Lords of Waterdeep.

Yeah I know all the reasons you hate this game. And every reason you don't like it are the reasons I do. I like that it's simple, and relatively basic, and that instead of adventurer figurines I have cubes (actually I would prefer the figurines... you are right here). My bro-in-law, who is a huge D&D geek, loved this game as well. We got the feeling of finishing quests. I get the abstract nature of this game, but the artwork and such still sucked me in. More of this. I cannot believe the great games I have been playing lately. It blows my mind!

An incredibly deep and rewarding game. Played 20+ times and always look forward to bringing it back to the table. Easy to pick up as the turn to turn choices are simple and always help build toward clear goals. Players can attack each other and there is strategy to choosing when to grab a resource to block opponents. My only complaint would be that you are sometimes at the mercy of your starting quests/quest deck. If you get up to 20+ playthroughs we added a custom rule where you get 2/3 Lords and then choose the one you want. Expansions add a ton of replay value, I just wish there was one more on the horizon. (Fingers crossed)

Played with Scoundrels of Skullport expansion

It isn't terrible and it wouldn't kill me to play it or anything, but for me nowhere near the top of the mounting pile of available worker placement games. I like worker placement, but there is really nothing here that feels new. 

Standard resource conversion - Gather resources, use those resources to acquire points or the ability to generate more resources. There are Caylus like buildings that are owned by players and available as additional actions to the players. The skulls seem like a necessary addition, adding some downside to taking powerful actions and creating another layer of risk/reward decision making. 

Aside from the standard grab the spot first type of player interaction, what little there is poorly implemented - I hated the 'mandatory quest' cards you can lay on other people. I don't mind take-that style stuff in games, but it seems awfully arbitrary and pointless here, and most importantly not at all fun. It is a drag to both play them on others, and get them played on you. They are nothing but a nuisance. You are constantly losing a cube here or a few bucks there to intrigue cards, which in a snowball engine game like this can really ripple through the game. 

It works and plays smoothly. But with so many worker placement options out there, I don't see how this displaces the myriad better options.

RATING: 7
I definitely understand the hype surrounding this game – it’s a very elegant eurogame which plays rather fast, scales well and offers you interesting decisions! It’s a light/medium eurogame which can be played in around an hour with 2-3 players. I like it the best with 3 players as you have 3 workers available compared to only 2 with 4-5 players (and with 2 players I would probably play another game). 

The most interesting part about the game is definitely the intrigue- and quest cards which add a nice twist and variety! However, that is also my only gripe with the game: the intrigue cards called mandatory quests are devastating... If you are attacked with some of those, it’s extremely hard to win as you only get 2 points for 3 cubes – it severely hampers your plans and is a very vicious “take that” element in the game, especially if played in the last round before you can complete one of your big quests... In some of my games I’m pretty sure it was a classic example of kingmaking, so that’s a little sad, but otherwise the game is a joy to play and the rest of the intrigue cards are perhaps imbalanced but not as bad as the mandatory quest cards (which I, being the most experienced player, typically receive...)

I think the theme is refreshing in a eurogame – it’s not about shipping goods in the 15-16th centuries! However, how people can claim that the game is thematic and even D&D-like is beyond me – this game could be rethemed in various ways and you could e.g. be a chef instead of a lord and then the cubes were various vegetables and you should complete recipes... Anyway, I don’t really care about themes, so it doesn’t detract from my rating – I still like the game quite a lot!

My primary gaming group has really embraced this worker placement game and I'm almost always glad to play it, though it lacks a bit compared to the "big" WP games like Agricola and such. After about 18 games I sold it, but have had to buy it again simply because it was so popular among guys who don't play a lot of games - and, as I said, it's a great intro to bigger WP games, so hopefully I can lure some of the players into playing Caylus or even Agricola...!

It's probably one of the best gateway games for non-gamers. A good game to play with gamers as well, and there's an expansion to add more. Easy game to pick up and play because of the simple actions,and still there's good amounts of strategy. Game plays well with 3-5 players. Good game to have!

Pushed this one to a 10.  I consider this my favorite worker placement game, and I play it on my iPad on a regular basis since it doesn't get a chance to get to the table very often.  Which is fine, because I like it either way.

The expansion improves the base game tremendously.

I have also "pimped" my copy to the near-max by obtaining the various items from The Broken Token (www.thebrokentoken.com) - which includes the insert, the D&Deeples, the new skulls, and the fantastically heavy coins.  The only thing I don't have is the "crate", which I may acquire at some point, but for now, the "box" will suffice.

Workerplacement without any new ideas. One of the most overrated game I have ever played. All mechanisms just packed together, that were carried out in other games much better. The gameplay is very bland and it was not really tried to fit the theme to it or vice versa. It’s just cubes, not clerics, knights or whatever. 
A game that any game designer with knowledge of last 10 years of boardgame design could have done easily done in an hour. I also can not understand, that LoW shines as a gateway game. There are really many games (also workerplacement games) which are not complicated, but have some tension and some interesting concepts. Why should it be a good gateway game if the gameplay is so uninteresting?

This is a fantastic game even though I've never won a game of it.  The tension between placements is intense, and you can never really predict the final results no matter how the scores look.

Update:  I have finally won a game!  This is my absolute favorite worker placement game of ever.  I like it because it's not a race to get the most workers, and with the buildings, the board is different every game.

Playing with the expansion is mandatory!  I would only give this game a 7 if not for the expansion.

The part that I absolutely love about this game is it is so easy to explain. I think I could go over the whole thing in 2 minutes and everyone will have enough knowledge to be effective.

Feels like Caylus Lite - simple worker placement to collect cubes to fulfill missions that require cubes.  Has a light-hearted take-that element as well.  Nothing new or ground-breaking but nothing wrong with the game either.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Pretty fun, liked the strategic options such as cards that can be used to remove adventurers from other players or gain them yourself (or a combination) or using your own building versus hoping someone else will use it.

Felt it was heavily random in many areas.  The Lord you receive is supposed to shape your strategy to some extent, and definitely gives you a direction to head, but can't be counted on too heavily.  You may have difficulty finding quests of the correct type, or the right adventurers to complete those quests.

The buildings that come up are random, may not show up in a game, and may not get built, and may not provide a certain type of adventurer.  That adventurer type, being rare, will cause a backlog of quests.  The bonus VP on buildings is intended to force buildings to cycle, but with 3-4VP on it in a game where quests are worth 8, 11, 15, 25, the extra VP from building is pretty negligible.

Finally, the quests are random, although the ability to cycle them is supposed to alleviate this it didn't seem to do well at that in our game.  Quests that were not ideal for the Lords in play or required a rare adventurer kept clogging the quest board up.

RATING: 3.5
Interesting game 5p. Dry euro I agree theme is not particularly deep. I found I'm not a fan of the intrigue card because they dd too much randomness to a euro. Randomness in terms of the different types of cards. Some are indirect but some are direct player interaction. It's not always desirable in game like this because it screw the efficiency engine of 1 player. The cards probably works better in games with less people.

Probably a slightly better ame with less people but it'll become more repetitive - I was hoping this will replace stone age for me but I don't think that will happen.


Omg the intrigue card is a bad leveller and random at that. If you get hit with an intrigue card near the end of the game that's it right there. Definitely not a fan at all. A rating of 3 is about right. I don't think I have dislike a 'good' game nearly that much before. All because of one mechanic.

RATING: 5
Rated 5 after one play. Well, I've had the chance to play a number of worker placement games prior to this one. So a rating is difficult without weighing this game against some other solid titles.

I supppose Lords of the Waterdeep is supposed to be different because of the theme and the card play. But, man... that theme is totally absent in the actual game play. The game is grab cubes, grab cards that tell you what cubes you need, turn in cubes for points. We were laughing at the total disconnect between game play and the "flavor." This strikes me as an attempt to coerce Ameritrashers into Euro game mechanics. 

At the same time, those mechanics are still subpar compared to other worker placement game. The "take that" aspect of intrigue cards is more annoying than anything, and the random draw of quests and buildings feels a bit too random. I mean, the game is not bad, but there's plenty of other options. It did make me want to play Carson City though!

An entry level worker placement game, but the DnD theme has no interest for me so I could care less to play this again. Like most entry level games you go to spots to get cubes, turn those cubes in to complete quests (score points), and that's about it. I will say Waterdeep has really good variety with quests and buildings that will be different every time and give you a different strategy each game to pursue. However, the game just felt so dry to me since the theme is lost on me. That means all the flavor text and the art while looked fine doesn't appeal to me so I felt like I was just pushing cubes around. Similar gateway worker placement games like Stone Age and Raiders of the North Sea pulled me in more and that makes those games far more enjoyable to me.

RATING: 7.6
This gets general good marks across the board.  Intrigue cards are fun and encourage more interesting play, but if you aren't in to complicated double-dealing you always have a clear path to victory- finish your quests!  There's light decision-making here, but unless you're a very serious 2-player competitor everything is fairly laid-back.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Decent combination of strategy (allocating resources) and luck (do the quests match your character?), but I disliked some of the design choices.  For example: having different art on every quest means players could possibly identify supposedly secret information by the art.  Having one image for all quests of a specific type would eliminate that possibility AND reduce the cost of the game.

"The game is made up of eight Rounds. In each round, players take a number of Turns. You can complete multiple quests in a Round, but only one quest each Turn."

I probably like this game more than it deserves because of its theme, but I think it is very solid game.  I haven't seen many games that had an obvious winner. I don't like is the secret lord thing would prefer them to be out in the open with the player choosing their lord.  Also felt there should a lord the can interfere with the builder lord like their are for every one competing for certain quest cards or not have the builder lord. I lost my first game of this because I didn't know that was one of the possibilities.

I played [thing=110327][/thing] once, and with a table of people who thought it was the best thing since sliced bread no less -- as they kept exclaiming through the game.  My recollection is of a thing, a sham, a mockery of a game which contained almost no decisions and almost no gameplay, but which required the players to go through the overt and rather demonstrative motions of playing a game, of continuously making game-like choices and actions without actually ever making any significant game decisions or doing anything interesting or competing in any non-trivial ways, all the while making the other players wait on faux tenterhooks in the suspenseful event that one of your non-decisions also affected them in a way they couldn't actually do anything about.  But maybe I was being charitable and so thought too well of it.

Perfect example of theme and mechanics tie-in.  There are very few games in my collection that I would play every session and this is one.

Nothing new whatsoever, but everything makes sense, is a ton of fun and is well thought.  The game is almost perfectly balanced with a few power tiping depending on what buildings you draw making some quests more powerful, but overall, no game will be the same and the power tip can be compensated by hate picking quests.

My favorite game of 2012 so far... and probably will stay as is.

My god...where to start? First off, the combination of theme and mechanics here is absolutely cringeworthy and doesn't work at all (unsurprisingly, no one refers to the coloured cubes by adventurer class. They instead just state their colour or come up with fruit/produce names for them). Asthetically, the board is boring and ugly. To top it all off, the game drags on too damn long for what it is (a simplistic worker placement game). Do yourself a favour and get Stone Age instead...or even Tribune.

:sugar: Preliminary impression:

Well, for good or for ill, this is where boardgaming is going, it seems.

It's a lite-with-a-"te" worker placement resource-gathering game where the resources are ostensibly people. It's quick, it has a light overlay of fantasy theme that's just enough bait for the hook to entice those with a close personal interest in owlbears into playing a Nerf-ball version of Caylus.

Like the old ads for Nerf balls promised, LoW will not harm lamps or old people.

In a lot of ways, this harkens back to the misty first days of the Euro boomlet ... Settlers, Carc, et al ... there's some strategy, there's some luck, it's not hard to explain and it's over before bedtime. That was what was intended and that is pretty well delivered. That said, if the collective judgement of the BGG Community is that this is [i]the twenty-somethingth best game in human history,[/i] I respectfully submit that the collective judgement of the BGG Community is smoking hashish.

Quibbling about ratings (especially as regards the new hotness) is a mug's game, of course, but still -- day-umm, peeps. This?

Ignore the doubters, this game is a classic!

What makes LoW fun is, of course, the card play. The simple backdrop of a generic D&D fantasy worker placement euro recipe filler is a perfect way to facillitate a super-fun, vicious, chaotic mad dash of a card game. That the game is the Intrigue cards was not at first apparent to us. It was only after several plays and after the card play really took off that we really went, hell ya, this is a game. Easily dismissable but, for us, some of the most fun we've had gaming.

Not a bad game but it needs a few fixes. You don't get enough actions on a turn and it made the game irritating rather than challenging.

Not a bad game but I would need to be in the right mood for it.

This game bring back dungeon and dragons to boardgame with a eurogame feel. The gameplay feels a bit like agricola in a sense that we allocate "agents" to perform one of the actions on the board and try to gather enough ressources to finish one of the quest. The addition of quests drawn at random and the intrigues cards gives a good replayability and not all games will be the same. There are also buildings you can add on waterdeep that allow additional actions for every player, giving a bonus to the owner if another player uses it. In that sense I never really felt like I was playing a lord in waterdeep sending adventurers on a mission. It felt more like I pay X ressources to complete the quest that gives me 10 points. However this taken apart the game itself is very well done and very fun to play. The gameplay will always be mixed between completion of quests and moves made to block the opponent and 1 wrong play in the last turn can cost you the game. Overall that game was a very good surprise, a well build strategy game that brings together elements that mixes very well, and yeah... I just forgot... it is in waterdeep.

This is the game that made me realize I dig worker placement games. I'd always avoided games like "Agricola" and their ilk because they seemed so horribly bland and theme-less, but then here comes this theme-rich game with its lovely board and intricate strategy, and suddenly I'm hooked. Other worker placement games have impressed me since, but I'll never need my arm twisted to return to this classic. It's a master class of "easy to learn, hard to master" game design.

Also own metal coins and class-specific meeples.

Face to face or IOS this is a good game.  

The 8.5 reflects the fickle nature of the game.  There is no elastic band if you cannot find synergies in the early game you are out of the running.

Interactions are weaker in this game than most worker placement games.  Shortage do occur and player order matters but most other highly rated worker placement games feel more cut throat.

Not my kind of game.  

Don't feel the theme at all in this one, just pushing colored cubes around.

Feels and plays a lot like Agricola, but the cards are much simpler and thanks to that the game is much easier to teach and learn. The components and artwork are topnoch!

Nothing unique though, but based on the above, I totally understand why that game is ranked so high on BGG TOP100.

Stripped back worker placement game. LoW flows beautifully, and I absolutely love the building mechanics where you get a bonus if others use your building. Despite the wide criticism stating the contrary, there is actually some nice theme peppered in here. The expansion is outstanding.

After 8 plays, still loving this game and bumped my original rating from 9 to 10. My wife loves Stone Age, but she now asks to play this instead, and she never asks to play games. No die rolling and in our two player games she's 2 for 3. Highly recommend for couples. Easy to play, theme is good but not too overbearing that non-gamers need to concern themselves. 

The 8 rounds make it long enough to develop some strategies but short enough to keep everyone's attention that the end is near, if that makes sense. This is not a heavy or even medium complexity game so don't look to this for a brain burner. Gateway game to other worker placement, resource management games with more complexity? Definitely! Good for families with kids. Yes. 

This definitely needs to win some awards.

Gateway worker placement game. Will keep this around for introducing newbies to different board game mechanics. I'm not a fan of Euros but this has enough theme and some decent gameplay at least to keep it around. I think this will defintely be better with the expansions added in.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a basic cube collection game but the artwork, intrigue cards, quests, and other stuff help to get it over the line - just. 
The simple game play helps you concentrate on what you're doing rather than struggle to remember rules/phases (e.g. Troyes). I'd like more games before making a permanent rating but it seems like fun to play.

RATING: 9
Lords of Waterdeep was a very fun and engaging game. After listening to the Dice Tower top games of 2012 I went out and got the game. It was described as a straightforward worker placement game with no revolutionary mechanics, but an overall well put together game. 

The box design is beautiful in my opinion. The artowrk is pretty nice (if not a bit bland). All of the components are nicely made (the DnDeeples would make for an excellent addition, however).

I played two games with a friend. I have not played many worker placement games, only having Puerto Rico as a basis for comparison, which is arguably not a worker placement game anyways. It took about 15 mins to get going, but we soon got the hang of the game. The gameplay is simple but engaging; I was worried the Lords would feel limiting, but they served as guidance as to which missions I would prefer over others. The Intrigue cards are great, adding another level of thought when playing the game.The game ended with a slight victory by my friend. 

From there, we dove into another game. This gameplay was more more confrontational (due in large part to the Intrigue cards drawn). I was able to deny my friend enough cleric resources to ultimately put myself ahead by a slight victory. The buildings drawn this time were also less helpful, leading to a game with lower scores all around. 

All-in-all a fun game. It is a nice introduction to Eurogames, and has my friend a lot more interested in designer games than he ever was before. I would give it a solid 9/10, and look forward to checking out the expansion to see what it might offer.

EDIT: After many plays, this game holds up for me with the expansion. It is fun, not too heavy and keeps me engaged every time. Great game.

*** Marvelous 'abstract' worker placement game. Abstract because, even if it's a Wizards of the Coast game, with official D&D licence, the theme is lost after the placement of your first worker. The game components and the package is 'almost' perfect...almost because the cards, the board, the workers and the box are stunning, but warriors, rouges, clerics and wizards represented with colored cubes are obscene!!

I don't have much experience with worker placement games, but I thoroughly enjoy this one.  Trying to complete the most quests while also trying to secure the most resources and prevent other players from completing their quests is fun.  I wish the town-building aspect was expanded a bit, as I think it should have a greater impact on how games play out, but it may be an effect of how my group plays.

RATING: 8
Excellent game - is easy enough to learn and introduce new players, but has good depth of strategy. After playing with 5 people I found your ability to influence the game is much reduced, and if you lose the momentum then you can become a passenger for the rest of the game. In my view the game becomes less balanced with more players (particularly if you are the last to play on the first round and the first player marker continues to be taken early for a couple of rounds). Nevertheless it is a good game that is very fun to play. 

18/8/13 - Played again with the new expansion in two player mode. Playing again reinforced my view that it is much tighter game with two players. Whenever I have played with large numbers I have felt that whoever is able to build momentum early (possibly through a good combination of early quest cards) can run away with the game and be very hard to peg back. If you lose momentum early you will lose. I think the two player mode removes much of this and the game is much tighter with less players.

One of the first "modern" board games I played before getting back into the hobby.  Was put off at first by the idea of a D&D board game, but that alone shouldn't turn people away.

Quite a basic, easy to grasp, worker placement game.  This is one of a few that I show to people that don't play board games regularly, or who are new to the hobby.  Fair amount of player interaction involved with Intrigue Cards, but not to the point of being mean that will put non-gamers off.

Fun at all player counts, particularly larger groups (and always longer game variants).  Some of the best experiences I've had with this game have in a 2-player game, and scores have ended close each time.

A solid favorite in my family gaming groups.  Easy to lose the theme of the game, although it can be played with a role-playing type of flair which can add to the fun.  Some have complained that it is just cube collecting and pushing, and this complaint is well-founded.  The redeeming quality of this game however is that it has successfully combined (although in a simpler form) many of the best elements of the various worker placement games.

Classic worker-placement. Even though I'm not a DnD player, I appreciate and enjoy the theme. I insist people play up the theme when playing with me. ;) We had trouble getting this to the table and it was not very interesting with 2. We took it to a local meetup and we talked about how we were thinking about trading it away and received remarks like, "Really??? Such a great game!!!" Then the people at the meetup chose other games to play, which solidified the fact that we just weren't going to play this enough to keep.

Post Wheaton effect buy. I like this game for it's easy...puzzle? I can enjoy this game with my Dad who was a D&D player in is youth. Though the main reason I keep this game is that Waterdeep reminds him of Brighton, and so I affectionatly call it "Lords of Brighton".

Being a Lord of Brighton is...satisfying, I think? The times I've played it I've enjoyed ticking and tocking away at the challenge. The worker placement is fun and I liked the decent blocking strategies, though I don't feel it was crunchy. 

I'd bring this out if my Dad asks me.

I am revising my rating of this game to a '10' after about a dozen plays.   I currently have over 200 games and as of this time,  this game is my only '10'.

This game is fun, easy to teach, and plays in an hour.  Standard mechanics similar to Agricola or Stone Age, but in a bit simpler presentation.  The Intrigue cards offer a chance to mess with opponents by taking resources, etc.
The D&D theme is there, barely, but it's not a deal breaker or maker.  You may find yourself saying " I need an orange cube and a white one", rather than " I need a Warrior and a Cleric...".   
The box is a unique, 3-piece design, but the insert/storage tray is by the far the most functional and well designed I have in my collection.
Great game, great components, great value.

My wife initially scoffed at it because "it's Dungeons and Dragons" but instantly became a cracked out maniac for it after that first play.  Now she'll play Agricola/Dominion/7 Wonders etc and has expressed interest in titles like Power Grid/Puerto Rico/Troyes without me steering her towards them.  

Although by no means the best thing ever, I think it would be fair to say that Lords of Waterdeep is the most important gateway game in my collection.  Everyone I have introduced it to loves it, and that stokes their interest to try out more and more of the gamer's games that have been sitting on the shelf collecting dust for so long.

Like it for the same reasons the hardcore Euro people don't, just Euro enough without the excessive, place these guys, get something, trade in, to build something else bigger, trade that in, for bigger, repeat and lacking the overload of options found in many Euros. OK they did a D&D theme so what? Had to have some theme, excellent game, theme works. And yes it is not a true D&D as you know it, I guess that theme was hijacked and it can't be used in another type of game without upsetting the Fanboys. It does need something other then cubes for people, 25 x 4 colored meeples or disc with character embroiled would have been the icing on the cake. Guess they wanted to keep down cost. Only minus, very, very slightly cutthroat, somewhat like Mission Red Planet, less than Ticket to Ride. Shouldn't stop you from buying it.

Purchased Danny's aka Relax wooden meeple replacements.

After playing this game more have to say it is well worth buying, very enjoyable. My only complaint with it is where they places the four upright quest cards on the board. If they do a reprint I hope they move this to the center of the board. The player at the opposite end of the board can have a hard time seeing the four quest cards laid out, other than that a prefect game.

It's hard to explain how a game that's so straight-forward and simple is still satisfying for a gaming geek.  But maybe that's just it - some streamlined simplicity in a marketplace of over-complicated point soup games?

In LoW players are simply sending out their workers (agents) to various board locations to get resources (adventurers) to complete goals (quests) and gain victory points or other benefits to help in the game.  One smart addition to the mix are buildings that you can chose to build and open up new worker locations - and when other players use your building, you get a small benefit.

You might notice above that the theme here is a bit thin, but everything looks good and there are bits of D&D lore woven into the quest cards.  So that will satisfy fantasy enthusiasts, while keeping the game accessible enough for anyone that couldn't tell a halfling from a bugbear.

Middle weight gateway worker placement game - less family oriented and more "gamer" game in comparison to Stone Age.
Fantasy theme is trying to cover the fact that this is the pure euro worker placement - points race.
I like the concept of intrique cards and also buildings are nice there.
Easy fun game, but I would say Stone Age is better as introductory game. On the other hand I would probably pick this over Stone Age to play with my gamer's friends because it feels less as a 'family' game.

Not a gateway for nongamers. Rules might be easy but requires many plays to form a strategy. Theme is stupid. Quests combo might feel like Burgundy or Dominion. Too much reading. Rewards learning the cards.

Components: Great artwork. A lot of care went into how to distinguish all the various components so they didn't just blend together in a sea of pieces. The box insert is expert. I wish the cubes were little fighters, clerics, rogues, and wizards.

Experience: Great worker placement game. Always something juicy to do on my turn. Lots of exciting opportunities, and only toward the end does it feel like counting cubes, trying to get in that last quest or two. More joyful and less punitive than Agricola, which this game has replaced for me. I really enjoy the quests; moreso than the lords cards, they ensure that each player has different motivations and value actions differently.

The more I play, the more I'm seeing different strategic options, ways to build mini-engines, maximize points, etc. Sometimes certain powerful quests come my way, but when they don't, I still have options.

A light, very simple worker placement game.  The reliance on random quests, and the occasional ability for a few lucky draws to skew the game does not ruin the experience, but leaves room for improvement.

There is a lack of variety in the worker spaces, and more actions alongside the 'get a resource/gold' or 'grab a quest' would be nice.  

Intrigue cards add decent flavour, and increase strategic play (with reassignment) and add an interesting factor.  Additional ways to acquire further intrigue cards would be beneficial (quests, starting player or grab quest seems a bit limiting). 

Overall for a light worker placement it plays very nicely, and keeps everything reigned in without overpowering new players or spoiling the experience.  Enjoyable for forgotten realms fans, or otherwise.

RATING: 7
A solid worker placement game, great for introducing players new to the idea.

You don't need to have any prior knowledge or experience with the theme (the Forgotten Realms setting for Dungeons & Dragons) to play. In fact the theme doesn't impact on play at all.

While the resource cubes represent warriors, wizards, clerics etc. People tend to refer to their colour more often, "I'll take 2 orange and a purple please."

The expansion adds some new stuff, I prefer playing the expansion over not.

Overall this game doesn't blow me away, but a good solid reliable game I've enjoyed many a time.

Good worker placement game, fairly straightforward. It does have some randomness issues, but that is probably a good thing for beginners. I feel there are also some balance issues, the Lord that gives points for buildings is too strong with a low player count and too weak with a high player count. Most people I play with think that the game is enhanced by the expansions, however I feel that the base game is better on its own as it feels less like competitive solitaire.

Caylus (decreasing worker choices) meets Louis XIV (changing missions) meets Thebes (flush missions). Faster/less painful then Caylus. Puerto Reeeko/Careless problem of 'less choices for the later position players'. 
Need 1 orange cube? Not available? Too bad. Few ways to convert/trade for one. Going last in the round? Just eat your worker cuz you can't do anything with it. Oh and missions are random. Highly annoying.

Solid reimplementation of Caylus as D&D game -- much more strategy than RPG. Didn't feel that "exciting" on first play -- obviously a good strategy game, but I'm looking for a little more "oomph" in future plays to bump up my rating any. That said, our first game was just 2-player, and I bet it's more compelling with 3+.

Skulduggerry, battles, commerce, magic, breaking into orc strongholds.... In theory this game should have them all. In practice you collect cubes representing people, and trade them in to say that you have completed some quests. There was a complete disconnection between the theme and the game play. It actually reminded me of Le Havre, but at least that doesn't try to be anything other than resource management.

Having RP'd more than a few evenings in and around Waterdeep, it's a pleasure to see it from this angle. Gameplay is solid and length of game feels just right. Easy to convince people to get together for this one, and if you happen to be looking to introduce a group of D&D players to board games, this is probably overall a better way of doing it than something like Castle Ravenloft (which might have them simply asking why they're not playing real D&D instead).

My gateway game into worker placement games, and I find it a real fun one.

Satisfying, interesting and has a lot of flavour. Recommended.

Lightweight worker placement with a fun theme. Gotta love domesticating them Owlbears. Building mechanic does a pretty decent job at injecting variety into the game, but building cost and abilities seem a little unbalanced, and intrigue cards vary greatly in utility and value. Some quest cards seem only "worth it" if you're lucky enough to get them early. The game is otherwise well-balanced and tends to be relatively close.

Highly elevated by the expansion, Scoundrels of Skullport, which has several mechanics to mitigate my complaints.

RATING: 8.9
This game is a great worker placement game and the add on adds allot more options. Buying houses is great way to add more others and because these change up, it makes the game more replayable. I wish there were Meeples instead of cubes to help with theme. You can also screw people over in this game. At a lower player count, or with family I'd play Stone Age but with a higher player count and with gamer friends, then I'd play this but with the expansion.

Quick to learn, quite intuitive and very enjoyable. It suits our current game requirements in that it plays well with 2 but scales up for more players and lasts under an hour.

It looks complicated on first glance if you are not used to new board games but after one round people can get the idea of the game very quickly.

Over the months that I've owned this game I've played it far and away more than any other game that I or any of my friends own. The rules are easily learned, which makes each successive game more streamlined, the randomness of what buildings are up for grabs makes each game different (to varying degrees) and the fact that each round is broken up into different workers matched with the building owner bonuses lessens downtime to negligible. The theme has been flamed for being "paper thin" by many users and I completely disagree, but in a way they wouldn't predict. At times, the theme *is* paper thin and at others, it's deep enough to warrant a battlecry for your faction. It all depends on how much D&D you've played before, how the game is going, what actions are being paired up with what locations, your playgroup, etc. etc. etc. At its worst, it's a worker placement game that's always different enough to keep you coming back for more. At its best, it's a romp through a crazy, ever-expanding city vying to screw your neighbor and emerge victorious.

Solid game with some things I like & some that I do not.  The rules are simple, making it a great game to teach to rookies.  I could see this going over well on my family game nights.  The theme is thin enough that I don't think it would scare anyone away who doesn't like the idea of D&D.  There is competition for resources, but there is always usually another way around the block to get what you need.  It's a great way to keep things friendly, while still being able to slow down your opponents if that is what you like to do.  It is a light game, but still lets you plan a few moves ahead.  It is a pretty good mix, but just a little too light for me to want a lot of plays.  I would like one more play to see if I change my mind, however.  The only thing that really bothered me was the lack of a hidden scoring element.  Ya, ya, I know there is one there, but it is too limited.  Your chance for hidden scoring is predetermined before you start playing, and all players are going to get roughly the same bonus unless they are sleeping.  So there is really no way to be sneaky.  With all that said, I would play it again if asked.  I might also buy it for the family gaming group.  But I wish it had just a little something more to pull me in.

Played twice. Perfectly functional worker-placement/action-drafting game with balanced actions. The 'quests' to be completed are not always balanced, though, and nor are the cards to be picked up. 

In one game, I caused one played to drop out of contention. Probably the best move for me - putting me one spot higher - but I don't think that screwage has a place in this game.

Perfectly functional and a game I'd be happy to play repeatedly and explore. But at the same time, it just doesn't excite me in the slightest.

RATING: 8
Whether you are collecting purple, white, black, and orange cubes or acquiring the services of Wizards, Clerics, Rogues, and Warriors, this game is fantastic for all types of players.  With a Dungeon & Dragons theme, you might expect a game that is dripping with a fantasy theme, but it's really only there if you look for it in the flavor text, card titles, and locations.  Aside from that, you have an engaging worker placement with a splash of interaction in the form of Intrigue cards.  But that little bit of interaction and take-that provided by the Intrigue cards prevents this game from being just another dry Euro.

It plays in an hour, and feels really fulfilling throughout.  Three player games are more open, but still fun, whereas five player games are crowded and cut-throat--and require new buildings to be added in order to have something for all agents to do.

It's just a great worker placement game with plenty of variability provided by the different Lords, the different Quests, the Intrigue cards, and the random additional buildings.

A strategy game based on worker placement and resource management, Lords of Waterdeep is a must have game if you are a D&D fan. Set in the city of Waterdeep along the Sword Coast of Faerun, LoW is played in turns where you try to gain the most points possible. You do this by buying buildings, setting adventurers out on quests, and playing cards that help you in certain ways. After 8 turns are over the person with the most points is the winner. Lords of Waterdeep is a favorite of most D&D players like myself and should be on the shelves of any D&D enthusiast.

RATING: 5
Nice, simple worker placement game with a D&D theme, but it really requires the Skullport expansion to make it interesting.  Don't let people 'get cubes' instead of recruiting a Mage! Without at least trying to bring out the theme the game can get a little dull. We also make people read their completed cards to help keep it interesting.   

Includes D&Deeples, just so it at least looks like you have a band of adventurers in your pub.

Worker placement in a Dragons and Dungeons environment, a succesful marriage in my opinion. There are a lot of cards in the game which immerse the players in the theme, without actually crawling through dungeons and fighting monsters. The players can choose quests from a display, and complete them by gathering a combination of money and 4 differently coloured blocks, representing fighters, magicians, clerics and rogues. They gather these resources by placing their workers in different parts of the city. During the game extra buildings can be built, each with their own properties. Every player can use these buildings, and each time this happens, the owner of the building also gets a reward. One can also obtain intrigue cards. These cards introduce an exciting surprise factor in the game.
The game is played over 8 rounds, and halfway through the game the players receive an extra worker. Game play is fluent, especially during the first half of the game, but as more buildings are placed on the board and more intrigue cards are collected the options grow and the action choices become increasingly difficult.

A decent worker placement game (though you don't really get many workers to place unless playing with 2-3 players). It's a great gateway game, but it's a bit lacking for anything else; with quests being the only way to score points, it really just comes down to finding the most efficient way to acquire the cubes you need to finish the quests your lord card gives you bonuses for.

Still, it's pretty fun, easy to teach, and the components are nice -- though I would've preferred plastic figures to wooden cubes; it never really feels like you're amassing warriors, wizards, etc, just colored blocks.

When played as the base game only, LoW is a simplistic worker placement gateway that has a useless theme slapped on in the hopes of attracting the RPG gamer to the world of euro board games.

I hated it.

1st change was to replace the cubes with DnD meeples and now it feels like you are playing with agents instead of souless wooden blocks. I didn't think it would matter, but it does.

Adding the expansion really helps because 1) Use of corruption markers create a new level of tension that was sorely needed, and 2) the expansion boards offer some really useful locations that let you pursue your quests instead of getting locked out places you'd like to go when you're finding the built buildings less than useful. Now it's much more of a strategic, efficiency race.

It's still simplistic, but now it's more interesting and does a better job of rewarding smart play.

Tries to retheme the worker placement mechanic, but fails to deliver anything significantly interesting in the process. I think I would have enjoyed the theme much more during my teen years, although admittedly, any theme could have been tacked onto this one. Had I played this [i]before[/i] I played Caylus, then perhaps I would rate it higher. But, it is very difficult to follow in Caylus' footsteps.

On the bright side, at least they didn't make it with plastic miniatures. I'll stick with Caylus, thanks.

Если душа требует еврогейма, а фермерские или индустриальные мотивы не воодушевляют, то это то что нужно! Классическая евроигра с выставлением рабочих, но в фентезийном мире ДнД. Правила объясняются за 10 минут, все просто и логично. Партия достаточно быстрая, по крайней мере при игре вдвоем. Да, атмосфера как таковая чувствуется слабо, но в какой евроигре она есть? По крайней мере антураж средневековых интриг душе приятней.

RATING: 7
Strategically straightforward but tactically deep, the difference between winning and losing is maximizing each turn. Hence, despite the obvious worker placement rules, it really is an action efficiency game. The blocking is less of a factor than doing the best thing with your action, which is why my opinion went from average-low to higher.

I then saw a few people who loved playing it just 2 player and at first I  wasn't quite sure it'd work, but tried it with my wife and it was a lot of fun. She did beat me both games, but we had a lot of good laughs and will be playing lots more.  Recommended 2-4 players

I used to play DnD with some friends and so that made the theme more enjoyable.
If your group is the kind of people that would bash on the theme they might not like the fact of playing but that doesn't mean they wouldn't enjoy this solid game.
It was my first worker placement game I played and I liked the feel of the game.
It is easy to learn and every time you play it can bring a different strategy that can be played depending on your Lord,buildings & quests that appeared.
While the rulebook & cards can be really thematic the Adventurers components lack it and are just colored cubes.
If you like/love this game I recommend investing in some DnDeeples.

RATING: 7
If you enjoy the D&D theme, it does add something to the fun-factor, particularly if you're willing to buy into it - to trade in warriors and clerics rather than oranges and whites - and are playing with others who are.

Theme aside, the game perhaps doesn't offer anything that couldn't be found in other basic worker-placement games - however, it does it in a really streamlined and elegant way. With experienced players, it flows really well and offers engaging choices without being AP-prone.

There are perhaps some slight balance issues, with regard to the luck of the initial draws, and the hidden Lords are a little dull in the base game but overall this is an excellent light-medium euro.

PS: Worst box ever - too big, too flimsy and the insert is way too fiddly to be worth bothering with.

Great simple worker placement. I used to play a lot of D&D so the theme (as pasted on as it may be) appeals to me. 

Place your dude and get your cube. I prefer Stone Age's resource acquisition by rolling dice which makes things a bit more risky.


I wish there was more incentive to figuring out who other people's lords are other than knowing (rather than assuming) the other player has 20-30 hidden points.

RATING: 7
A decent worker placement game with some take-that opportunities for player interaction. It's fun and (for this sort of game) nicely fast-paced.

The hype, of course, is the Dungeons & Dragons theme. Does the theme actually shine through in the game? Nope. I tried pretty hard to get my RPG-loving kids to call the cubes "adventurers" and to say what "quests" they were completing... but instead they just said "I'm turning in two white cubes and a purple cube for 4 points".

Because that's what the game *is*... it's not an adventure or questing game, it's just drawn that way.  ;-)

(Check out Tom Vasel's review... he tries so hard to call those cubes clerics, rogues, etc.)

EDIT: The expansion (Skullport) adds enough elements to this game to make it worth keeping.

Probably one of the lightest worker placement games around, which is not a bad thing at all.  Leans more on luck than heavier games like Agricola.  In the same light, your decisions aren't nearly as damning, as your strategy can quickly and intuitively be readjusted.  The focus on instant scoring over end game scoring makes your turns more satisfying.  The variety in the cards and quest rewards opens the doors for many different strategies.  The game takes nearly no time to learn and you will have fun during even your first game.  Highly recommend the Skullport expansion.

RATING: 5
Middling action selection game that fans of D&D will no doubt enjoy. Unfortunately, I felt that players who get the cube generating buildings and/or the plot quests in the early part of the game have a substantial advantage over those that don't, at least in games with 4+ players. It might not guarantee you victory but it sure helps, especially if those plot quest bonuses happen to line up with your character's bonuses. The same holds for a player who gets an extra action marker early. Also, you're pretty much toast if a couple players team up on you with early mandatory quests.

The net result is yet another game with a rich-get-richer problem which, while not severe, is probably going to affect the end game. And frankly there's really nothing particularly original about this game. The theme is thinly pasted on. The high rating is yet another example of how a good theme tends to blind the BGG community to mediocre mechanics.

So [i]Dominant Species[/i] still stands as king of the action placement games IMO, and even [i]Lancaster[/i] is far more interesting.

Update: A bunch of games on the iPad pretty much confirm my initial misgivings about the game. I've heard the expansion helps, though. We shall see. In the meantime, this is relegated to the iPad only.

This is an elementary, engaging worker placement game, although not really an innovative one. The mandatory quests, though, are too unbalancing; those need to be removed or their use limited through house rules. In fact, the attack cards in general invite retaliation. The game can devolve into an unpleasant affair in which the players' plans become nearly useless, and the prime 'strategy' is fending off attacks and completing mandatory quests.

A well-balanced light worker placement game with the D&D theme tacked on. Intrigue cards add some player interaction, especially Mandatory Quests.

The insert is so perfectly organized you can literally be playing within one minute. The rules are likewise extremely streamlined.

However there is NOTHING original in this game to explain its meteoric rise through the ranks.

Edit: I hate this game. I recently bought the iPad version, no idea why. Playing it reminded me why I sold the board game years ago.

I had heard expansions fix the problems of balance and luck vs length. They do not. They seem to make it worse. Will not play again, ever, in any form, for any reason.

I went into this thinking "Oh great, another weak effort to port AD&D to a boardgame."  Well, I was wrong.  They've taken the fairly tried and true, if stale, mechanic of worker placement, and really snazzed it up with the Quests and Intrigue cards.  The little touches of theme are just enough to flavor the game nicely, without being to heavy-handed.  A very solid game that has quite a bit of replay possibilities.  I would compare this very favorably to Pillars of the Earth, another WP game that I enjoy.

One of my favourite games. 
+ Worker placement
+ Player interaction through cards
+ Changing goals during play (quest cards)
+ Extra bennefits through buildable buildings
+ Hidden goal end-scoring
+ Plays well with two players. The buildings however are more usefull with three or more players. Both game experiences are different, but are unique in their own way. (More space on the board vs more income).

The Scoundrels of Skullport expansion is a musthave if you own this game. It adds new pathways to the game where you can gamble your luck if you fall behind. It makes the game perfect in my opinion. Risk vs reward.

It just needed a little more punch to make it standout...either via theme or mechanics.

Players are lords of Waterdeep, recruiting parties of adventurers to complete quests on your behalf.  Standard worker placement where players alternate taking an action, denying it to the opponents.  Most actions gain cubes in four colours (clerics, wizards, warriors and rogues), after which these can be paid back to complete a quest card. Quests rewards players with points and other stuff, and often an ongoing ability.  A deck of Intrigue cards enables mild road blocks to be tossed at the opponents, which can hinder them but isn't as outright nasty as other games of this genre (Caylus, Manhattan Project).  All in all, a good, tight game that retains a nice sense of theme, and produces close finishes.  Classy.

First play impressions: Fun, fast moving working placement. played with an expansion which I was told made it quite chaotic. After reading the boxtop, the theme vanished. This was "place your dude here, get a cube. Use these cubes to gain these points" That is was D&D related didn't come up once in the entire game. I did like this better than Agricola. Felt less stressful and more fun. Not having to worry about "I must get x amount of food by turn y" was nice.

[Esp] Me gusto mucho el juego aparte de ser dinámico, para los maniáticos del orden como yo la caja es realmente una joya, todo tiene su lugar y además esta diseñada para que jamas te cueste sacar una pieza o carta, ojala todas fueran tan bien pensadas. El juego se trata de administrar agentes para conseguir diferentes tipos de aventureros que te servirán a su vez para completar las misiones que te entregan puntos de victoria.

Mindenekelőtt elmondható a játékról, hogy ízig-vérig munkás-lehelyezős, de abból a jobbak közül való. 2 fővel is kiválóan működik, ami egy nagy előnye a játéknak (habár többen még ki sem próbáltuk). A tematikussága kérdőjel, mi próbáltuk a kockákat a "nevükön" szólítani, úgymond harcos, tolvaj, pap, varázsló, de a küldetések megoldásakor így is sokszor ez hangzott el: "akkor én most megoldom ezt a küldetést, beadok 3 feketét, 1 fehéret, 1 lilát és kapok érte 6 győzelmi pontot és 4 pénzt". Egyébként lehet tematikusan is játszani, ha valaki az összes szöveget elolvassa és beleéli magát, valószínűleg működhet. A szerencse a kártyák miatt jelen van, ez főleg az intrika kártyák esetében vehető észre jobban. 2 játékosnál egy csomó lap nem annyira hatékony (amiből  persze én jó sokat húztam :)), mert arról szólnak, hogy kapsz 2 valamit, de egy általad választott ellenfeled is kap 1-et ugyanabból. A játék hozza a komolyabb euró-k hosszát, habár ez több játékosnál nem tudom hogyan alakul, valószínűleg hasonló, mert olyankor kevesebb munkással, ööö "ügynökkel" rendelkezünk. Ami tetszett benne, az a saját épületek vásárlásának lehetősége, mert amikor más is használja azt, akkor mi is jutalékban részesülünk. Ami még jó volt, hogy a kikötőbe helyezett emberünket a kör végén újra fel lehetett használni, ezzel plusz lépéshez jutva. A szabályai egyáltalán nem bonyolultak, így nyugodtan ajánlható játékosabb családoknak is. (2015.07.31.)

RATING: 6.5
A lot of people seem to regard this as an amazing awesome game.  I don't.
Don't get me wrong, it's a solid little worker placement title.  There's very little in here I actively dislike.  Ironically, I'd like it more if everyone else liked it less, since the biggest strike against it is how overplayed it is.

There are a couple rough edges, like the wildly varying power of cards.  Getting a plot quest that matches your type on the first turn can be crucial, as that gives you an advantage from the turn you complete it.  Having an extra flow of cubes, points, or actions can be the edge that lets you win the game.   Getting a plot quest late, though, is crappy, since you won't have time to make use of the power and it provides fewer points.  Intrigue cards also have a lot of useful ones, some situational ones, and a few that are really weak.
You get no control over your initial 2 quests, and there are few things in the game that let you discard uncompleted quests for any effect.  So, one player may get 2 that dovetail exactly with his lord's goal, while another will have to spend early actions fishing them out of the inn display, if there are even any there.  
All of the goals are really the same, except one.  You just have 2 flavors of quest that you like, and that's it.  The one that's the most different (buildings) is also the most swingy.  If you can get it rolling, you can crush with it, but it's tough to do.  The more players, the less likely you'll be able to camp on the start player and builder's hall spots, and whether you see any quests that give you buildings as rewards is totally random.  It's also very obvious and easy to block, so even if you're not winning, people may go out of their way to stop you.
For these reasons, winding up as start player on the first turn can also be a huge benefit.

It feels like a few tweaks or house rules would sharpen this one up a lot.

Wow, a great little worker-placement game that has never failed to impress. We're big fans of this one, and it works great as a two-player game. 

The expansion adds corruption, which I really like. Unfortunately, adding a sixth player really increases our play time. We tend to play games where we just about always have to teach them to new people, and a 6-player Lords took about 2 1/2  hours to play. It's fun, but there isn't enough there to keep me interested after 2 1/2 hours. Now, five players is excellent, usually about 1 1/2 hours. Especially if everyone knows how to play already.

Easy worker placement game in a fantasy setting, placed in my favorite fantasy world: Forgotten Realms. 
My longest lasting and all time favorite D&D character, Grima Ravenlitch, which I am playing for more than 7 years now, is born in Waterdeep. When I saw this game on Tabletop I just knew I have to own it.
I enjoy this game more than it probably deserves, but overall it is a decent worker placement game I like to call "fantasy Agricola", although it is much much simpler, but with some player interaction.

[b]Update:[/b] Upgraded to 7 with Scoundrels of Skullport expansion, mostly because of cool corruption mechanic and risk of high negative point count in the end.

RATING: 7.5
Nyelvfüggő (igaz nem bonyolult angol, és alapfokkal is érthető) - és így mínusz 1 pont. A másik fájdalmam, hogy nem olcsó, és ha már nem olcsó, akkor ha már ez egy fantasyval leöntött eurogame, akkor a kalandozókat jelölő kis kockák helyett miből állt volna műanyag bábukat tenni bele (a'la Giants, AoE III) ????? Nem is sok kellett volna bele, pofásabb lenne, hangulatosabb, elvarázsolóbb.
Nos ennyit a negatívumokról. És a pozitív:
A tábla az elemek -a kockákon kívül- szépek, jól eltaláltak, a játék ötletes felépítésű, változatos, már csak a küldetések, és az intrikák miatt is. A játék hossza is jól eltalált, szóval -bár jelentős újítások nincsenek benne- de egy jól összerakott, igazán jól sikerült játék, ráadásul 2-5 fős, s ami ha az első kettő negatívum nem lenne (nyelvfüggő s kockák), akkor már a beszerzésén gondolkodnék (de ajándékba így is szívesen fogadom :-))
Azóta ha jól látom készültek hozzá kártyamagyarítások, mondjuk így persze még drágább a játék -mert hát ugye azt is el kell készíteni-

This is fun game, and I'll play it anytime. It's main downside is that a lot depends on the luck of the draw - you need to draw right cards at right moment. 

Except for that the game is excellent. Everyone who like worker placement games would probably love this one too.

edit: play without mandatory quests, and it's a way better game. Also, draw more quests in the start, and choose which to keep, to minimize luck-impact on the game (you don't get any Q for your char, someone else gets both Qs).

Probably the easiest worker placement game to teach and learn.  I almost feel as if it's too easy.  I'm used to games taking a few, if not several plays, to mentally digest.  The design on this game is so good, that I understood how everything fit together from the first play.  I like my games to feel a little hard to get.  Lords of Waterdeep bared it all the first game.  If you've played other worker placement games, especially the Rosenberg games, this one is going to feel real easy.  You're going to be scoring points like Kareem Abdul-jabbar.  You're going to slam dunk so many quests, the backboard is going to shatter, which can be a little anti-climactic if you're used needing a few plays to get your head around a game, perhaps a little disappointing.  I like the game fine.  It plays super smooth and I alway love the tension that in game scoring tracks provide.  It just moved a little too fast for me to actually fall in love with it.  

A lot of people compare this game to Agricola and Caylus, but I actually think it has the overall feel of Ticket to Ride.  You basically throw down your workers to get resources (that feel like train car cards) that enable you to complete quests (that feel like destination tickets).  You're also doing some set collection a la artifact cards in Stone Age.  I'm going to go against the grain and say this game feels like a cross of Stone Age and Ticket to Ride.  It's a good time!

RATING: 6
well developed game - no sharp edges, few major rules issues, and no graphical mistakes...

that said - it just a YaWPG (yet another worker placement game) that goes on a little long for what it is, yet is a little too complicated to be an intro game and it lacks enough meat to be compelling for the experienced gamer.

would not refuse to play if strongly requested but i wouldn't seek it out either.

Lords of Waterdeep is a worker-placement game set in the D&D city of its title.  Players act as secretive Lords vying for control/influence over the city.  Utilizing agents (workers) players will recruit adventurers (warriors, rogues, clerics, and mages) to complete quests and score points and gain benefits.  The basic buildings at the start of the game provide players with the different types of adventurers, allows a player to build, pick up a quest, or gain money etc.  

In addition to the basic starting buildings , there are many other buildings that offer rewards often greater than the basic buildings.  A player claims ownership over the buildings they build and will gain a side perk everytime another player uses that building.  This is a nice feature of the game and makes decisions to use other players' buildings an interesting one since it provides its owner with a benefit.

The game also features Intrigue cards that can be used to give you (and often another player) a utility, an attack, or a mandatory quest that forces the target player to complete it at a very inefficient cost before other quests.  Some people don't enjoy the take-that aspect of the cards, but I enjoy the added player interaction and the ability to prevent a runaway leader.

All in all, Lords of Waterdeep is a fun lighter medium weight worker-placement game.  Definitely recommended.

After one play: nice, simple worker placement game. My only reservation is that I get the feeling at times that I don't have much choice on my turn: the lord card dictates my quests, the quests dictate my resources, and as a result, on any given turn there may be only a few spaces on the board that I actually want.  Contrast this with Agricola where there's usually a lot more spaces that I want than I'm able to take. 0-1

2013-09-17 : Super-light worker-placement game with only tactical choices and no long-term strategies due to heavy randomness.

One of our favorite games. So simple, yet has a lot of deep strategy decisions involved. With the custom meeples, makes it even better experience. Gets a play a week, and still never gets old. Can't wait to see what the expansion will bring.

Just get resources (adventurers) and complete quests. The Lord cards make the end winner an unknown which always adds to the suspense. Plays best with 3. 

Any game I can teach my mom and she picks up in turn 2 and starts throwing evil cards my way is a win in my book. Its not as deep as some would like, but any game you can teach people easily in 10 minutes, and they pick it up and enjoy themselves is a win in my book.

UPDATE: Knockng this one down to an 8 - we still play it a lot but I find that the lord cards are kind of unbalanced and therefore somewhat unsatisfying.

As usual, I came late to the party on this one. I got it toward the end of 2013 but it's probably my favorite game of the year. A good worker placement game that plays out in a decent amount of time and has some good player interaction. It's also easy to teach, unlike most games in the worker placement genre.

Certainly nothing really wrong with this game, just not very inspiring. The mechanisms all work ok, it plays quickly and seemed fairly balanced. However, the game play doesn't really do much that is new or innovated. The D&D theme does not carry through. At no time did I think I was some Lord sending out people on quests or gathering fighters, clerics, etc. I was just gathering cubes and gold to turn into victory points or other resources. It will probably sell well due to the theme and it may appeal to RPGers who want to branch out into boardgames. Not in my top 5 worker placement games.

Lords of Waterdeep is the perfect marriage of a Gateway game + Worker Placement.   It does wrap it up with a nice DnD theme which is personally an enhancement for my enjoyment and makes sense with the intrigue cards.  It really should have came with the DnDeeples though instead of cubes.  Overall, I think I enjoyed it more than some other lighter worker placement games such as Kingsburg but I would just rather play something a little heavier.  I would likely rate this higher if not for the mandatory quests.

I really wanted to like this game - and it wasn't bad, it just didn't seem that good. There were a number of complaints over people (I helped) hoarding the harbour to stop others playing quests and things (it is a strategy game) but I was amazed how close the game ended (well 3 people in practically joint second, with one clear winner due to getting a nice easy 25 point quest!)

Second time pushed my score from 6.5 up to 7.5

Lords of Waterdeep is a simple game, yet is very rich and fulfilling. Both new and experienced gamers typically enjoy it, even at the same table.  It is a superb gateway game, and many fans have this featured on their family game night.  I actually know of one family that has 3 generations playing it together.

This game will have a presence in the gaming industry for some time, and hopefully there will be more games that make attempts at doing what LoW does well.

Perfectly acceptable game with a higher rank then it would of had without the D&D theme (which oddly enough I did not feel when playing it).

RATING: 5
Waterdeep has just about everything a gamer should expect, without anything additional to set it apart. Erecting new buildings, and subsequently owning them, is the most interesting aspect of the game, but the game still boils down to collecting cubes and completing quests, which makes the narrative incredibly linear. Had I played it earlier in my gaming career maybe my opinions would differ, but it terms of modern board games it is decidedly average.

RATING: 7
Played once, and was surprised by how good this was.  Yes, it's not very original, but it's good to see a D&D themed game with modern design.  Also, while I like adventure games, it's good to see WOTC break out of that mold and try something new with a very adventure-focused intellectual property.  I'd happily play this again.

I typically enjoy the base game at different player counts, although I do not like to play with Mandatory Quests with only 2 players. This is a solid gateway game and an excellent introduction to worker placement games. The theme is pasted on, but with the theme and the nice components, it is a good way to get someone with fantasy interest to try a euro. In general, the components and storage tray are great, although I dislike the art on the lord cards. When played with the Scoundrels expansion, the game goes up to a solid 9 for me.

Simple and fun worker placement game. Nice Euro design all around... themed into Dungeons and Dragons. It is the game I pull out when discussing "hybrid design" and *why* the board game community *needs* more games like this.

Intuitive, easy to teach, easy to play. All those things describe Eurogaming at it's finest. Beautiful artwork, confrontational card play, solid theme. That's what American gamers enjoy.

Lords of Waterdeep brings it all together in a great mix. The essence classic Euros with *the* classic American theme. 

Oh. And the insert doesn't suck.

Beautiful, simple, elegant worker placement. With more players it gets interesting having to be more creative in figuring out how to get your resources. Intrigue cards and balancing time VS total number of actions taken add a huge dimension of strategy to a game that initially seemed a little flat. Very excited to try it with the expansion.

Lot's of fun.  Very interactive, and not too long, worker-placement euro with a D&D theme.  Lovely.

Edit: After several plays we are removing the Mandatory Quest intrigue cards from the game.  Very contentious.  I'm sure the function of the card was to help counter a runaway leader but it plays more like a kingmaker.  The mechanic feels out of place in the game.

Super pasted on theme. Deal with it. LoW is a great light, randomized worker placment game. I've been looking for a lighter worker placment game for quite a while, and I'm quite satisified with how this one turned out.

LoW is GREAT! One of my all time favorites. I've played the game probably 10 times at this point. Scoundrels of Skullport is an absolute must though at this point. This is a great game to introduce new players to the Euro Worker Placement genre of games. Plus, it's nice to be assigning a brave adventuring party quests for a change, then actually completing the quest yourself :)

I have played several times, and it appears in my limited exposure that the crux of the experienced game players is to create a chain of events to complete multiple quests as rapidly as possible... and to prevent others from doing the same.

Unfortunately, this does require a level of knowledge of the cards that a newer or less frequent player does not have.

I like Lords of Waterdeep. But I can't help feel a tinge of disappointment because I really wanted to like it. It's a good worker-placement game. It is much more forgiving and friendlier than other worker placement games. There isn't the sort of tight worker placement situations you get in other such games. (You know the ones I mean, where if you don't place properly, you're screwed.) But this also means that at times, the game will feel slow and boring. Components-wise, I thought the artwork was evocative of Waterdeep but  cubes do not equal adventurers to me! (Maybe it's the RPG player in me.)

RATING: 6
This is a great game that can be used to introduce someone to worker placement games. Sometimes the D&D theme can throw people off but usually it's not a big deal.  My biggest problem with this game is that it can often become a game where there is always clearly a "best" decision for you which limits the amount of thought you actually put into your turn.  I've heard that the expansion really helps this problem, but i'v yet to play it.

Well done worker placement game. Learn it in 10 mins.  Played with 5 and that worked well.  I decided against buying Stone Age after one play;  this one gets it right on several levels.  The placement options expand / change over the game, the goals change, and additional agents / workers become available.

Have now played many, many times with 2, 3, 4 and 5 and like everything about this game.  Upgraded to 10.  A well-done game all around.

[3 plays] A total Euro worker-placement game, with a D&D theme but nothing D&D-like about it. Oddly, I like this better than the games that do try to stuff an RPG into a boardgame box.

Only two plays with two so far. A touch more complicated than, for example, Stone Age. It feels like a lighter version of Caylus, which is welcome in my collection. The mechanics are solid. If you're interested in the theme I'm sorry to report it is quite thin. You have to make an effort to read the flavor text and think of resource collection as "party building." But if you're not interested in the theme then Good News! You can ignore the theme and enjoy a solid mid-light worker placement game.

Scoundrels of Skullport expansion included.

I don't know about the hard-core Euro-gamers (http://opinionatedgamers.com/2012/05/25/review-lords-of-waterdeep/) who think this game is too generic. Maybe someday I'll understand why they look down on it, but in the meantime, I intend to enjoy it as an excellent gateway worker placement option. Stone Age is the only other game of the genre I can think of that is so accessible. As a gamer, I enjoy both, but still find LoW more entertaining.

A great light weight and streamlined worker placement game that has a low setup time. Great as an introductory game to worker placement and maybe even as a gateway game (provided the theme appeals). Really like the buildings and the Intrigue cards and Quests that set it apart from other worker placement games. Okay with 2 players, much better with 3, probably best with 4, a bit too long with 5.

I love the insert because it facilitates setting up by a great deal. Transportation can be a bit tricky with this game because the lid doesn't close all the way.

This light worker placement game gets high marks due to its stellar track record as a gateway game. It has brought more people into "our" kind of boardgaming than any other game I've ever had or played.

Yes, it is light. Yes, the random elements make it less an euro than you think it is. Yes, you can start play and have all the players realize the mechanics within a round or two, making long rules explanations uncecessary. It can replace the usual line-up of dull as dishwater trivia games played with the family or friends and open their minds to a larger world of gaming.

Broken Token Insert, D&D Meeples, in one box w/ expansion

This one used to be one of the higher rated games in the collection.  It was our first worker placement.  The theme, while thin, worked since I've known about the Lords of Waterdeep since D&D 2e and Undermountain.  

The base game got better with the expansion, but the game eventually started wearing thin.  Game play boils down to the same formula (unless you're the builder) for each player every turn.  After that it's up to the random elements to help the game along, which ends up being pretty dull.

This game went from a high 8 or low 9 to a solid 6.  I'm keeping it around as it's a good introduction to worker placement games.

I love, love, love:
- the Intrigue cards and getting more actions if you play them
- the simple, straight-forward worker placement mechanism
- the upgraded adventurers we bought on Etsy
- the buildings benefiting both the user and the owner

I dislike:
- that the theme is rather pasted on, and even with our upgraded components, it still ultimately feels like I'm just getting resources, putting them back, getting points, repeat
- that some of the buildings that just aren't that wanted during a game end up sitting for a few rounds because no one wants to pay for them or use them, so no more good buildings come out till someone gives in and buys one
- some of the Lords don't offer bonuses that are as good as others
- the Lords don't really offer anything special; even if someone figures out you're after Arcana and Piety, they probably won't sacrifice their own chances at more points just to take those cards from you, so they might as well not be secret unless you really like to pay attention to the scores
- the Mandatory Quests--were those really a thing in DnD?

Final verdict: It's a decent Euro game with some take-that moments, a pasted-on theme, and a meh feeling of accomplishment at the end.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
This game is a hot mess.  Worker placement games are typically about action efficiency and engine building.  In Lords of Waterdeep, there is very little engine building, and too many random elements.

Things they could have done better:
1.  The buildings are terrible.  Split the buildings into an A stack and a B stack.  The A stack should be all those long term use buildings used for building engines.  The B stack should focus more on double-use tiles.  How many times has a building come out near the end when you've gone "Oh, well that's useless."?  Answer: too many.

2.  You should have more control over your quests.  Either have one stack per faction, or split them into A/B stacks again.  This brings me to

3.  Faction leaders are boring.  Having them as hidden information is not terrible useful, as they're easy to deduce.  It would be better to give people open information and some bonus for having that leader instead (maybe get +1 warrior when taking warriors, those types of things).

4.  Remove the Mandatory Quests, or at least give people some reward for them.  The "Take That!" element of the game is tacked on and used for a quick laugh; it adds nothing to the game proper.

Almost required expansion to the base game. Skullport and Undermountain add interesting and powerful location to the board, usually shaping the course of the game or at least influencing plays (Q + play I is a powerful effect).

6th players adds depth to the game altough it can be a bit long, expecially if players are good (lots of thinking time).

Corruption is for me the best mechanic. Choosing between risking to loose point in order to rush quests or buildings are play conservatively can make or break a strategy, and corrupted effect are very powerful. Without it, the game might become a bit streamlined (actually never played without skullport, could consider playing without undermountain). Overall almost mandatory expansion

A simple, yet satisfying worker placement game. My geek friends found and enjoyed a plethora of Forgotten Realms references. The only quarrel I have with this game is that, despite what the box says, it's nearly unplayable with 5 players: you WILL find yourself with nothing useful to do more than one time, if someone who played before you has an agenda similar to yours. Always play with 3 or 4 players.

Here's my problem - theme. As others have stated here, it's a fairly standard worker placement game, which is fine, and no doubt mechanically sound. What annoys me though is how opaque the theme is. I'm a Lord of a what now? Doing something with Wizards and buildings and missions and what? All just to get Victory points. I generally dislike Euro games and Worker placement games, and this is a good example of why. Many gamers say they dislike Abstract Strategy Games, since there is no theme. Well, I dislike dry, pointless mathematical excercises that pretend that they have a theme that matters.

This is one of my favorite games that came out in recent years. Is it perfect? No. Is is a deep game? Not really. Is it a lot of fun regardless of the outcome? Yes. It might be my favorite worker placement game. I love the fact that more places come out where you place your workers as the game progresses, and that there are sometimes opportunities to re-use the spaces other workers have already taken. The use of Intrigue cards in Waterdeep Harbor gives a variable number of worker placements and more opportunities to fulfill quests. I'm not so keen on the Mandatory Quests; they can be really nasty at the end of the game.

Lords of Waterdeep is a Euro-styled worker-placement game that, although on the light side, offers a plethora of choices and depth. The theme makes it feel a little more "fun" than other Eurogames, and it is the perfect game when you want to just relax and have some fun without resorting to more arbitrary, goofy games like King of Tokyo.

Lords of Waterdeep in my opinion is unique since it combines D&D theme with worker placement mechanic. The art is very beautiful and invoke a strong theme, however this theme is somewhat reduced by the publisher's decision to put in the workers's meeples as "cube" instead of adventurers/D&D characters as they should be. You can buy the customised meeples to improve your gaming experience, but that is more money spent.

The gameplay is interesting, with lots of player interactions through Intrigue cards, denying your opponents important workers etc.

I expected to not like this game very much, but was pleasantly surprised.  The game is disconnected from the theme of the game.  I actually think the game would have done better not being themed in the DnD world.  It feels nothing like playing DnD or any other roleplaying/fantasy game.  It could have been a much more generic theme and probably done better overall.  Looking forward to the expansion to see what that brings to the game.

Lords of Waterdeep is the sort of game that can be very swingy, and very dominated by the luck of the draw.  The theme is severely pasted-on, but if you're an old timey D&D nerd like I am, and you put some effort into role playing and enjoying the theme, it can really pop out.

DnDeeples (and forcing other players to call adventurers by their proper titles and not just colors) are an absolute necessity to get the most out of this game.

Despite the fact that, objectively, I think this is not a particularly [i]good[/i] game, I manage to immerse myself in the thin theme and really enjoy the process.  Sometimes a balanced, elegant game system is less important than having some fun placating the walking statue.

Purchased due to the hype but I'm simply not compelled by it.

Seems very odd to me that there is no penalty for incomplete quests. Would be a decent source of tension and it's just not there, but I suppose I was expecting it to be a typical Euro. It is not; it's practically a beer & pretzels game.

Update: decided to give the ios app a try (to support board game apps) and it's mildly entertaining to play on my ipad, but I still feel no need to otherwise own the game.

A good, light worker placement game.  Great for introducing new people to Eurogames or to hobby boardgaming in general--this could be the next rung up from "Ticket to Ride".

While my heart is with its heavier brothers (Agricola, Le Havre, etc.), LoW offers a lighter, faster romp that's often perfect for a low-stress game night.

I have never really liked worker placement, except this game.  The main thing that makes this game a great worker placement is that you do not need to pay for your workers in any way. In fact, there is a way to extend your workers AND get a bonus by using waterdeep harbor. 

It's great that you can directly hurt and help other people via card play. The take that element must be used judiciously and as a potential target, you must plan for your situation to change quickly.

Wizards of the coast take on a euro game, yet still set in the D+D universe.

You collect cubes to complete quests for victory points in this worker placement game, where the number of options increases through the game with the building of additional places to put your workers, but the number of workers you have remains very low (2-3).

Secret identities at end of game for bonus victory points are a nice touch however the game gives you far to many intrigue cards which you then can't use.

Its all just a bit bland, not enough workers (and no scope to increase your worker pool) for it to really be worker placement, too many options on placement so effectively no blocking your opponents, just a bit bland and uninspired really

I want to like lords of waterdeep because its a cool and interesting theme however I just dont. I don't like it

Played this several times and recently realised that I enjoy it more with fewer players. What I dislike is Choice Denial, and coming last purely because the options left to me are all rubbish and the one ting I had to have has already gone. But with LoD, there's less of that but still too much for my liking. Other than that, it does what it says on the tin. Remarkable tight, often fluid, and for so few actions, you can get a lot done if you keep on one path.

But just not a game I'm ever going to buy.

Stone Age was beautiful, but the game never really grabbed me. Lords of Waterdeep is the light-medium worker placement I've been waiting for. Euro sensibilities, with quests, action cards - very nice.

2013AUG30 - 2 players wasn't as enjoyable, but still fun, and moved very quick. Dropped rating a pint to an 8. Still my favorite light worker placement game.

May 2014: Reflection rating. One of the better cube-flipping point-salad games, but just...no. This one is simple, fairly symmetrical, and too much over and over.

July 2014: Another play of this game confirmed my reflection rating from May. In fact, after my third playing of this game, I actively do NOT want to play it again, and so am rating it a 4. If I'm going to acquire things and flip them into other things, I'd rather play Ora & Labora or Le Havre. It's true those games are much heavier, which means I'm still waiting for a good middleweight conversion game.

LoW is very abstract - just grabbing colored cubes to make simple sequences. The game is almost two short to get a real feeling of accomplishment (Glass Road does more in less time). The game is fairly symmetrical in the resource distribution (purple/white at 1 cube per grab, black/orange at 2). Many of the buildings are slight variations on each other.

Rather play...
...a heavier similar game: Ora et Labora, Le Havre
...a middleweight with some flipping: Glass Road
...a shorter abstract: Splendor

RATING: 9
What a gem and what a surprise!  Don't let the name Dungeons & Dragons in huge letters plastered across the box fool you--this is NOT Dungeons & Dragons, not even close.  This is a resource game with quests.

Rules are simple and easily learned.  The game lasts 8 rounds, play is relaxed and fun.  Each player's unattained quests and resources are common knowledge so strategy is important when a player deals out attacks or rewards.  Switching positions on the score track is common, and game end can reveal an unexpected winner.

The game also has one of the really nice inserts.  It is a bit fiddly putting away, but there is a place for everything and when the box is closed & even transported, and the quality contents stay put.  

All really liked this game.  Looking forward to some obvious expansions.

EDIT: I have played a lot of games now with a lot of people.  I haven't begun to tire of it, and everyone has liked it.  Increased the rating.

Increased the rating again.  How appreciative we all are for the simplicity of this game.  There is no question what to do on the board; All the quests and their rewards are clear; The building benefits are obvious; and the Intrigue cards are all unambiguous and easily understood.  The rules are easy to remember--don't play it for a year (unlikely) and pull it out and start playing.  How nice it that?

This is one of my new favorite games. I've probably played it 5 times as of this writing. I don't know why but the game tends to be sort of addictive and exciting as you play it, once you get into it. One good feature of the game is that there are a bunch of (secret) things that get tallied up at the end, so even if you are looking at the points as the game goes on, you don't really know who is ahead until the very end after those things have been tabulated.

RATING: 9
Probably the best worker placement I've ever played. Will play differently each time thanks to the different order in which the quests, intrigues and buildings will come plus the kind of quests you'll have to go for to please your lord. But not giving it a 10 because of the cubes. Probably the cheapest solution, but I would have prefered chits showing the different kind of characters. And one other minor gripe is that when lucky the cards you start with could prove to be slightly too advantageous. For instance the plot quest reward that makes you gain a rogue (black cube) everytime you gain some gold.

Mathematical optimization & resource management to the max !

I've only played the iOS version of this game--and only against computer players--but from what I've read it's an accurate adaptation so I feel okay about rating the boardgame version. I don't have much experience with worker placement games, but this one seems very solid. You have more on your mind than just placing cubes, for example, with quests and "intrigue" to take into consideration. Also, you have essentially two types of workers:  one type actually do the work and occupy spots on the board, and one type are essentially currency that helps you complete objectives. This is a high scoring game but so far it seems very balanced. Commonly I'll have a game where the winner has, say, 120 points and the next two highest players are within 5 points of that. Definitely a good sign.

Since my game group doesn't have any real worker placement games in our rotation I'm thinking about this one, especially since the group is also our D&D group.

I never expected to like this game. It's a worker placement game, which can be good, but I have been generally hesitant about Eurogames as of late. Well, this game is pretty light by worker placement standards, and having tired myself with boring brain burners like Agricola and Caylus, this was a positive thing in my book. That's not to say it's a shallow game. It's a simple game that is as frivolous or deep as you make it. Casual gamers can dive in and have fun, but there's enough meat for serious gamers looking for a serious challenge.

I've had people complain that it borrows too much from other games, but that is fine with me because it borrows stuff that works and works well together.

Ignoring the theme, it is still a classic Euro game. Yes, not the first worker placement by far, nor the best, but still great. The theme is worked into it in many little ways that you don't realize how much it is integrated with the logic of things like the quests. So good.

I bought this when it came out and I've taught this game to dozens of people over the years (would not doubt it is in the triple digits by now), and many have gone out and immediately bought it afterwards.

A great, accessible, entertaining worker placement game. Everyone seems to pick this up easily and everyone I have played with has enjoyed it.

Yes, some of the decisions and penalties aren't that heavy - you're family aren't going to strave a la Agricola - but it just plays really well, is quite breezy and then picks up in intensity towards the end when you work out that you can't do everything you want. It's nice to start looking at some of the none VP benefits of completing quests and start chaining these into other quests. Players seem to love getting the combos to work.

It isn't the heaviest of games but it is fun, it plays at a good pace and doesn't overstay it's welcome, and it keeps you interest until the very end as there are nearly always options to mitigate certain actions having been taken without losing out too much.

Our games have always seemed to finish fairly close which also keeps all of the players interest high.

It's not the BEST.GAME.EVER. but I do find that when I'm playing this game I am enjoying myself more than I do playing certain, more respected worker placement games.

Nagyon szép kivitelezés, viszonylag egyszerű, gyorsan tanulható szabályok. A hangulat nekem kicsit hiányzott, de ez lehet, hogy csak azért volt, mert nagyon pörgettük és nem volt idő beleélni magunkat a küldetésekbe. Így kicsit "adjál nekem egy narancsot meg egy feketét"-re redukálódott a feeling. A játékmenet meglepően érdekes és összetett volt a relatíve egyszerű szabályok ellenére. Szívesen játszanék még vele, mert így elsőre kicsit kapkodnom kellett a fejemet. Negatívumként talán azt említeném, hogy az intrikakártyák erejében hatalmas különbségek vannak, és nem csak helyzettől függően, hanem abszolút értelemben is.

A quest game with zero geographic elements is fighting an uphill battle to win favor with me, for starters. There is clearly room for expert play, since the two experienced players kicked everyone else's butts in my first game of this, but I didn't find the decision space interesting enough to warrant trying to gain that expertise. It would be a good way to introduce people to worker placement games, I suppose.

I'm not sure I will ever understand the appeal of resource optimization games coupled with random take that elements and both targetted and untargetted mayhem.

Ignoring this part for the moment, Lords of Waterdeep cobbles together various elements from other games in the worker placement genre without actually adding any new ideas of its own. That integration work isn't badly done, and the resulting game is a little flat but otherwise a nice enough entry-level worker placement game - excepting the hooliganisms mentioned at the beginning. But maybe those are what is requested by the game's target audience.

Das thematisch in der Welt der Adventure Quests angesiedelte LORDS OF WATERDEEP ist ein angenehm einfacher und geradliniger Artgenosse ohne Hirnverschraubung: Worker setzen, Aktion machen. Fertig. Meist Rohstoffe nehmen, wobei die guten alten Ressourcenklötzchen hier Manpower wie Priester oder Magier darstellen. Thematisch natürlich genauso  aufgeklebt wie die Auftragskarten, die hier eben halt Quests durch das Spiel gehen mit genretypischen Namen und Fantasy Flavour Pics in fiktivem Mittelalter Ambiente. WATERDEEP gewinnt durch seine Schnörkellosigkeit, die einen schnellen Einstieg in das Spiel fördert und es einem leicht macht. Es braucht die Windungen und diverse Ebenen komplexer Strukturen nicht, um ein Spiel zu sein, das in überschaubarer Spielzeit auf simple Weise Spaß macht. Es braucht auch nichts Neues. Das ist WATERDEEP. Nicht mehr, aber auch nicht weniger.

One of the first games I have even owned that I felt was underpriced for the value it gives. The components are excellent, wood pieces, solid cardboard, excellently designed box interior as well.
The gameplay is amazing. Worker placement with amazing options.  The quests add a level of excitement, with some having a lasting effect on the game. Balancing victory point options against each other, short term gain or long term plan. It's well balanced for all players.  And it has excellent replay.  The DnD flavor is amazing as well, each card has its own piece of flavor.  I can't say enough about it, it has immediately risen to my top five, and I don't see it leaving any time soon.

RATING: 3
Yes I belong to the camp that finds the theme tacked on When I play I don't feel like I'm sending a party of adventurers on an epic quest, I just need 3 orange and a white cube for that card.

Might be my lack of imagination but LoWD just didn't do it for me.

RATING: 6
The rules are easy to learn and explain. I would recommend Lord of Waterdeep to casual gamers. Hardcore gamers may find LoW a little light for their tastes though.
While I like the fantasy tropes, setting up plots and quests for adventurers, I found that the theme wasn't integral to the game. One could enjoy the game without knowing anything about D&D or Waterdeep.

A really strange marriage of D&D theme and euro-style mechanics.  To be fair though, the theme feels pretty non-existent during play.  This is about as simple as you can get with a worker placement game.  The game play is light and pleasant, but really not all that novel.  One plus is the level of direct player interaction that games of this style general lack.

RATING: 8.088
A really nice and enjoyable worker placement game. The rules make sense, and there is just enough going on. An excellent game (11/1/13: rating 9).  This is a serious good game, and it plays (and is required to be played) differently depending on how the building cards come out. Every game has been enjoyable, and i still feel i should be a lot better at it! Define rating still of 9 (14/12/13). UPDATE I think the expansion turned me a little off this game (I didnt like it), but its still good, just havent got back to it (Rating 8.743 Jan 17).  Again, familiarity and seemingly the single strategy is the winner who gets more 25 point quests has dragged the game down for me, but that said, it is such a clean obvious clear design of a game which is so nice.  Even when you need to consult the excellent rules sheet, the answer ends up being a confirmation of what you expect.  Still an excellent game to introduce newbues to worker placement, and the variability of buildings and quests still make it interesting for occasional play (Rating 8.088, Feb 17)

RATING: 6
Finally got to try LoW, which I've wanted to for awhile before taking the plunge on buying it. I'm glad to have played it, but don't think I'd buy it myself. There really isn't anything new here: collect cubes through worker placement and resolve Quests by cashing in those cubes. Of course, there's a bit more to it than that, and it is these extra elements that make it an enjoyable game. But I wouldn't say LoW is a great game - I'd much rather play Caylus, which has certainly inspired some of the mechanics here. I will say, the cubes really do hurt the theme of the game. I know this is a Euro-mechanic game with a very Ameritrash theme. But I would have so much rather used plastic figures to represent people than cubes. Hell, even graphic cardboard counters would have been better!

A lighter and faster playing worker placement game. The decisions were not engaging or interesting to me. I did not feel like I was gathering an army to take on an epic quest, I just felt like I was gathering cubes. The board was wide open (at least in a three player game) and I did not feel any tension in the game. Also note I'm not a fan of hidden objective mechanic. I like heavier games or lighter games.

This is a game that a lot of people love. I would never turn down a game because its a good game. But even though this is a good game, there were a few things that prevent me from making the space needed to keep it in my collection. My problems are: I mainly play 2-player and at this number the board feels too open, the  intrigue cards are meh, and the random setup can really put one player at a disadvantage from the start. I am sure many will disagree, but at 2 players this just isn't for me.

A nice worker placement game with a well done theme that makes it more attractive to those who might not otherwise be interested in euro-style games.

The only complaint anyone had was with the art on the Lords of Waterdeep cards.  The portraits didn't seem to match the quality of the rest of the presentation.

Update:  after three plays (admittedly not a lot), where two included the lord that gives bonus points for building control, there's some concern that that lord may be underpowered.  It's also possible that it simply requires a different strategy to win with that lord.

Update:  and on the fourth play someone finally won with the lord that gives bonus points for building control (somehow that lord has ended up in three of the four games I've played).  Not to take away from his victory, but it did require some luck, mainly being able to grab and complete the plot quest that lets you use a location already used by someone else by the end of turn two.

Still not entirely sure it's balanced, but willing to keep playing with it for now.

See comments for Scoundrels of Skullport.

I like the base Lords of Waterdeep game well enough, but after a number of plays with the expansion, I would prefer to only play including it and not go back to the base game if I can possibly avoid it, the expansion just makes it so much better in every way.

RATING: 6.005
Light worker placement, prelim rating.  While there is a strong attempt at theme, when have you ever felt cubes were actually wizards, rogues, and fighters going on quests?  It's really an oxy-moron to even try this type of game, but so be it.  The game has a strategy element, but also a fair amount of chaos.  The direct interaction comes from a placement where up to 3 workers can use a card effect, which hurts or benefits one or more players.  For those who aren't fans of worker placement games, I can't see this theme-dressed version having any more appeal than a straight-up cube pusher.

A dynamic mix of Stone Age and Agricola. Nothing really original though as the game borrows from the best worker placement games without innnovating - but it does so very efficiently.

The only negative IMO : in spite of all the efforts of the game designers, the theme will quickly become absolutely irrelevant. It is a matter of collecting then discarding cubes of different colours, not about recruiting wizards or clerics and sending them for epic quests... 

It does not prevent LoW from being very good and one of the most enjoyeable worker placement games - maybe the best ? LoW calls for more and more plays and does not wear with time. Deserves a 10.

Good game, easy to play and easy to teach!  Very gateway. I agree with most that the theme doesn't feel pasted on, the sending out of agents to do the dirty work is very in keeping with how the "real" Lords of Waterdeep works, reading out loud the title of the quest cards and calling the cubes by their character class adds to the theme quite a lot. I really don't know why WotC went with cubes, they could have made chits or something more representing instead.

The various functions of the location also makes sense, its not the sort of game where you can pre-plan your strategy, to win you have to leverage & respond to the quests & buildings available in the game as well as your hidden objective.

Caylus light with a nice fanatsy theme pasted onto a fairly typical cube pusher euro. This is one of the resourse rich style games more common of late - get as many cubes as you can and convert them to VP as efficiently as you can in the limited 8 turns of the game. Intrigue cards provide some limited player interaction but this is mostly about grabbing the action spot that you need and deniing it to the other players. Components are very good all round.

Rating dropped after adding the Scoundrels of Skullport expansion - added "take that" Intrigue cards mean that a player can be targeted and set back arbitrarily - not ideal (for me) in an efficiancy race game.

RATING: 8
The best introductory worker placement game out there in my opinion. There are enough options that you don't feel like you're getting completely screwed too often (like in Agricola). At its heart it's a solid mechanical eurogame with just enough D&D theme slathered on the top to carry it through. Excellent component quality, nice box, top notch (if fiddly) insert.

Mandatory quests may end friendships though. Just saying.

This is such a nice, clean worker placement game, a genre which generally doesn't do much for me. Quick-playing, nothing fancy and nothing extraneous. Very well developed and pruned game.

While the theme itself is neither a positive nor a negative for me, I really appreciate how it all makes sense, even if it might be a little thin. That's a direct contrast to so many games where the overall mechanics and goals just don't make any sense at all.

My group enjoys this game for its simplicity. It's a VERY straight forward worker placement game, but the iconography ans board layout make it extremely easy to learn and play. The expansion (scoundrels) is a must have for the corruption tokens and board spaces! I like D&D and fantasy, but I'm not sure the theme is relevant here. For straight worker placement, this is a good starter, but ultimately I'd prefer to play Manhattan Project or Viticulture. The theme works better in those.

This was way better than anticipated. It is a D&D game about as much as Powergrid is an Electricity game.  Thematically only.

Played this a dozen times and won ten of them, I have to say there are a lot of problems with the game. It's a simple worker placement in the end, much like Stone Age with the expansion and has no strategic depth even if you force it. That's ok by it's own but when you add the fact that the D&D fluff ends up in black & orange cubes getting you points... The only interesting thing you can do is to throw eachother mandatory quests, which is far from a clever mechanic.

My rating keeps going higher the more I play it. It's a very playable game with two, but gets better with more players.

This is a game I did not like that much the first time I played it. I compared it with Caylus, my favourite eurogame ever, and this is an unfair match since both games are different although the mechanics are similar. Waterdeep is an easier game, very well suited for newbies since it is very easy to explain and the players know from the very beginning what they have to do to get resources and money, something that is not present in more subttle games like Agricola or Caylus. This could be a drawback, but somehow the game is not shallow and provides meat for the experienced gamer. This is a very special game in this matter, and acts as a fantastic gateway game and also a good game for skilled eurogamers.

A good game idea, reeks of not enough play testing.  Issues with availability of resources, randomness of quests, randomness of strength in intrigue cards, and being almost locked in how you play with the Lord character cards leads to little tactics and and even less surprises.

Basic worker placement game. You just manage your cubes while the theme is completely irrelevant - it could be sci-fi or the building of a Cathedral.

I much prefer something with more decisions like Caylus.

RATING: 8
This is a fantastic and highly interactive worker placement game. The hidden end game bonuses, the buildings that add spaces on the board with benefits for the owner and the quests that give you permanent bonuses add up to a very fun game. The intrigue cards gives even more interaction. The expansion does a lot for the game, but it's still fun without it. A lot of people complain that it's too simple, but there's a difference between easy to play and lacking of depth. Sure there's plenty of more complex WP games with even more depth, but the depth-to-complexity ratio is best in this game.

Also, best inlay ever made!

I'll add a recent comment:
[q] In my experience, LoW is the best streamlined worker placement game. Sure it doesn't quite sell you on its theme with a bunch of cubes pretending to be warriors, but it's so very friendly in its ways. It's simple to teach and it helps new players by nudging them so slightly with the lord mechanic. "Oh, I like Skulduggery quests! I see one there, I'll go pick it up. I see it needs some black cubes, I'll just head there next. Oh, there's a nice building that I can build that all the other players will use, that seems like fun." It's also the worker placement game I've played with the fewest spots. I think this is a strength of the game, because it makes the game less intimidating and the competition more fierce. As the game goes on, new locations are created by the players, increasing the complexity with a nice pace dictated by the players.

The expansion adds a lot to the game as well, the corruption mechanic is a favourite of mine. You can take better rewards on certain spots with the penalty of taking corruption. The more corruption that the group collectively takes, the more negative points are awarded in the end. This gives the game an interesting group dynamic and is very thematic.[/q]

Perfect for when I want to play a worker placement game but I don't feel up for a worker placement game. Contradiction? Yes. But so is this game - euro mechanics (light, admittedly) - with a tasty ameritrash coat of paint. A bit simple, but for some reason it hasn't gotten old. The quality of the game - from components, to the plastic insert, the box, the theme - I think it elevates what could have been a very mediocre game into something that I'll keep coming back to.

Bought iOS version in March 2014, and I've played Greg's physical copy many times too. A straightforward yet compelling worker placement game, great for hooking in non-hardcore gamers.

But after more than 10 plays (face to face) it's starting to feel a little rote. The expansion(s) would no doubt help, but for now I think I'll give it a break.

Comparisons to Caylus make a lot of sense.  I don't think the strategic depth is the same here, and hence, it's going to be easier to get to the table with a broader audience.  For me, in my collection, that's the appeal of it, more than the fact that I love it.  But I love that it's easy to teach, and easy to understand, and easy to not feel like you're getting your butt kicked, and that most people I know will want to play it more than they will play Caylus (which I really do love).

I heard how good this game was, but I didn't expect it to be this fun when I first played it.  This game is amazingly good for one that can be played in 90 minutes or less with a group of people.  It's not too deep or too strategic, yet it has enough of both to satisfy those ready for a fun game, one that could be considered either a warm-up, a filler, or just a good game for the day.

Edit: After playing Yedo a few times, I've decided that I like that game a lot better than LoWD.

One of the worst game i ever played. No time (only 8 round!!!), no startegy , the same activity every tima, only 2-3 agent, too much luck (draw the quest, hope that the other player never choice your activity...). Disgusting!

While it really is just a bland cube collector game underneath, there's just something about this game that makes it good. Ease of play, and fantasy theme make this an easy one to get non-gamers enjoying.

I don't know why, but exchanging the cubes in this game is very cathartic. Normally I'm bored by worker placement or cube-pushers, but LoW just somehow does it for me.

I highly recommend this one for anyone looking for a themed Euro that's a good gateway game, yet won't bore the gamer geeks in the group.

Played on iPad. This is a little bit different worker placement game than I'm used to (because of quests). The more I play this game, the more I like it. The theme of the game may seem odd, but that's not a big problem. This game has nicely balanced strategy, luck and player interaction together. Lords of Waterdeep has some "back-stabbing" player interaction elements like giving mandatory quest to particular opponent, making some minor "bad things", which can distract some people from game, however, majority wouldn't have much problems with that, I suppose. Mandatory quests as player interaction element is balanced as well - they are easy to complete and still gives you some victory points. Great game, just the theme could be better.

The theme really adds nothing to the game. Lords of Waterdeep just feels like a generic, paint-by-numbers Euro worker placement game. There's approximately zero originality here. However, I did enjoy the game and would be willing to play again. The most enjoyable part is the logistics of sequencing the quests you hope to complete, making sure you have enough money and adventurers at the proper times. The intrigue cards also add a welcome splash of flavor and unpredictability that isn't always present in this style of game.

Overall, a solid and workmanlike game. I would like to have seen more opportunity for tactics and planning. But if you're looking for a lighter style of worker placement game and aren't put off by the lack of originality, go ahead and check it out. I think Lords of Waterdeep is aimed at fantasy gamers who probably aren't as immersed in the tropes and lexicon of Eurogames as I am, so the makers have (understandably) emphasized conformity and smoothness rather than innovation and subtlety.

Excellent, streamlined, simple worker placement. This is THE game to introduce people to that mechanic and to euros more broadly. Kids can be competitive with the adults. My twins are eight and play pretty well with each of them having won at least once in a half dozen plays. Some games are closer than others, and games CAN be a runaway if one person completes a couple of big payoff quests.

Some of my friends have really hyped this game. While I was eager to test it I had a gut feeling that it wouldn’t rock my world. I was right in my assumption. There isn’t something inherently wrong with the game, but there is not enough distinctiveness and tough decisions for my taste. The spots where you can place your agents are crowded, but only a few times it was hard to know where to place it. What I really like in the game is the plot quests. There is no strong snowball economy building element of the game, but if you complete plot quests you get abilities which help you throughout the game barring that you sacrifice other rewards.

Previously gave this a low evaluation. Over the years, I've come to appreciate smooth and easy mechanics that are easy for strangers (at meetups) or friends who want a easy game to play. Will start playing this again and see if it deserves a better score.

12/26: After having this sit on my shelves with virtually no play, I've come to realize that this wp game takes too long to play for such simple mechanics. Would definitely play, but not own.

For trade, with DnDeeples.

I've come to realize that a big part of why some eurogame players don't love Waterdeep is that there's nothing hard about it on an individual level *if you mostly ignore other players*. When you come to see it as an economic game, where affecting the supply and demand of various (initially equivalent) resources, you're on the road towards choosing it over Agricola sometimes.

RATING: 5
Two plays with four, two plays with five, one with six. Run-of-the-mill worker-placement game; the main differentiating element is the deck of aggravating "take that" intrigue cards. It's tolerable as a four-player game, as it moves along fairly quickly, but with six it's just a bore.

RATING: 6
An average game that I bump a point for ambitious theme. I like worker placement/optimization games and I like take that/luck of the draw games, but I'm not convinced those are two great tastes that taste good together. Opinion may improve with repeat play and properly calibrated expectations. Would benefit from a fairy dust sprinkle of RPG mechanics -- maybe powers for faction leaders, and the ability to level them up? As it is now, the mechanics of the game could as easily be applied to rushing around a warehouse preparing orders for shipment ...

Played once with 4 players and enjoyed the experience. Placing just 2 or 3 workers a round helps to keep it going at a pace. I am looking forward to playing again and next time I will make a better job of getting some ongoing quest bonuses early in the game. From my one game I would say 4 is the best number to play with, I guess it would run a little long with 5 and lack some tension with 3. April 2012

Making a worker placement game in the universe of d&d is quite amusing but it works.  The rules are easy to learn and it plays smoothly.  However I think that the crappy quests you can give to other players, it's just too mean in a game like this and this makes this game too prone to kingmaking.

I'm not sure that it will have the longevity of something like Caylus, which it, ahem... resembles, but it's a great game nonetheless. Easy to play, so I should be able to get to know the various strategies.

August 2012 update: I'm starting to suspect that with 2 players, going for quests under 20 points is a waste of time, unless there are specific situational rewards that you need. Not sure if this realisation reduces my rating or not... probably not. In fact, I'm bumping my rating up for now, as the game's still very enjoyable after several plays.

October 2013 update: It's a very, very smooth game - the game's interface is superbly designed so that you're focusing on the strategy and not the rules.

August 2014 update: it's still excellent.

Get purple cubes from the purple cube store and then sell them for victory points at the purple-and-black cube store. Sometimes when you sell cubes, a store gives you points AND MORE CUBES, which you can cube at the cube cube for cubes.

Also, honorable mention for having the most blindingly obvious flavor text possible on most quests, e.g. [b]Unearth The Magic Treasure - Powerful treasures are hidden underground.[/b] (Except I made that one up because the real examples were too boring to remember.)

Cube.

Really awesome theme, quests are interesting and the worker placement is enjoyable. Nice balance of just having few enough options to make the game feel interactive but not cramped. Feels like you're never out of it: largely because of the hidden lords. Definitely feels like a gateway into the worker placement genre and makes me want to go deeper. 

If I could tear at this game for anything it'd be the setup/takedown, which as well organised as it is can feel like a drag relative to the complexity of the actual game. The insert is also kinda annoying now that I've moved to vertical storage, and it is too tight on the corners of the board, squishing them [-](Need to remove it at some point)[/-]. Removed it, base game and expansion in one box now.

Note: This comment is for the Lord's of Waterdeep base game & its exps.

Have to admit that I played D&D a handful of times as an adult with a group of co-workers. We worked the night shift and we had time off during the day while our spouses and families were at work and school. Found it enjoyable. So, when I heard there was a worker placement D&D game that really wasn't the same as the D&D experience, it got me excited.

Rating = 10 due to it being a solid game, replayable, easy to teach people, & opens the fantasy world without it being too "fantasy". Will always play this game.

2p this game is great (I think due to the fact you'll complete a lot of quests); I expected it to get better with more players, but its just more frustrating realy (like any good euro I guess).  Still enjoy it certainly but not as high as I thought it might be.

OK, this game will not provide grizzled gaming grouches with epic tales of swords and sorcery to enthrall their grandchildren, however it is a colourful, relatively simple worker placement game which has enough moving parts to keep it humming along nicely for 80 mins. or so.  If you want to move your friends on from party games to board games then this is a solid pick.  The graphic design and iconography is so good that you will be up and running in minutes and it’s pretty intuitive so you rarely need to reference the rules during play.  Further, it had enough decision points to amuse my group of war gamers, who adopted some strategic lines of play that I hadn’t thought of. Still beat them, though.  So, something for everyone then?

A good worker placement game with an excellent D&D theme.  Admittedly, some of my enjoyment of this game comes from my knowledge of the setting, having spent a lot of time in Waterdeep in D&D campaigns and computer games.  

The game itself is fairly simple but moves along nicely and always seems to throw up a close ending.  The hidden characters give extra VP conditions and these often are the difference between winning and losing at the end of the game.

Simple worker-placement game with lots of theme. They try hard to get the Dungeons and Dragons theme into every aspect of the game, but experienced players will ignore the chrom and just focus on the color of the cubes and the victory points. Feels like a simple Caylus with a theme that evokes Discworld: Ankh-Morpork. These are both great games, so Waterdeep is in good company. I'd play this again.

It's an ok worker placement game, but I didn't feel the  theme at all. Calling black cubes rogues and purple cubes wizards is a stretch. The cards had nice artwork and text that was completely besides the point. I need white cubes, so I play an intrigue card that gives me white cubes. I didn't even read most of them. The one I do remember (because it made me laugh) was Crime Wave, which meant that the player got some black cubes...

The game designers seems to have gone half way in the design. It feels like an empty game. I don't feel anything when I play this game, it lacks depth and you don't feel like at the head of a guild of adventurers. The "adventurers" just feel like a bunch of merchandise... even if you replace them with miniatures, they are just merchandise.
I will probably make a real version of this game, it's just too bland, shallow and empty.
The game was made like at 50% of what it could be. You don't feel like you have adventurers in your guild, more like merchandise that you spend or virtue like in The Village. You should not lose adventurers (unless they die) when you have some in your guild, you keep them and they continue to work for you.
Instead of cubes, the adventurers should have been cards that you get via a certain action and the cubes would be influence cubes. Each adventure would have a risk factor which would be reduced by the amount of adventurers you send, but the more you send, the less you will have for other adventures and the lesser experience they will each get.
I think this would have been a much more exciting game than this piece of half made junk that you play a couple of times and then move on to something else.

You would need to pay me to get this game.

RATING: 6
This is a bit of an odd one to me, because I've played the game three times, but never without the scoundrels expansion. I'm not a huge fan worker placement games in general unless there's some serious theme stacked on top with additional mechanics. I found myself having a delightful time with this game despite myself, but in retrospect, I realize that a lot of that had to do with the things added in the expansion. Without those additions, it would likely be another dry worker placement game for me. Also, it helps to play this with people who are really invested in crafting a story with the goings on in the game.

Lords of Waterdeep is a thematic worker placement game that runs smoothly and does not have any real flaws. Players compete to recruit adventurers (handled in the manner of resources) in order to send them off on quests that yield victory points. The quests add diversity by means of additional rewards that kick in on completion - such as permanent effects. Intrigue cards allow the players to directly or indirectly affect their opponents. 

All in all this is a great package. I thoroughly enjoy this one. To a considerable degree this is due to the way the theme is presented. It is that much more engaging than that of many sterile run of the mill euros (all of those medieval building construction and renaissance seafaring "themes" that are somewhat utterly generic). While none of the mechanics are new as such, they all fit into each other just nicely and produce a thoroughly enjoyable experience. One can understand the game and start playing within 5 minutes.

Worker placement game with a D&D theme.  Nice screwage element thrown in.  Nothing new mechanics wise.  Limited appeal to other than light euro-types and fantasy fans.  Since I'm not a huge euro fan, the theme gets me to play it.  It'll see enough play for my group to be worth having purchased.

If you were to make a fairly generic worker placement game, you'd make Lords of Waterdeep. It's a good intro game, but it's only one I'll play if I have to. I'd rather play something with more meat.

The Scoundrels at Skullport expansion makes this game soooo much better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Takes a lot from worker placement mechanics and wraps them up in a great theme, with the Quest cards as goals, and the extra twist of Intrigue cards that can really throw some surprises at the players. Play is pretty tense and *very* quick for a Euro, so there's not much time to enjoy the great artwork and theme text. But it's all beautifully done.

Will be seeing our game table regularly.

A few months later: this has become a regular go-to for game nights, has withstood a ton of play time and still seems fresh every game.

Two years later: bumping this up to my second BGG 10 rating ever. This continues to get plays and remain exciting, even without the expansion.

Wizards have done well with this one. Even on opening the box and seeing all the gaps, holes, and slots for all the pieces an OCD wet dream. the box design truly is a work of art.

No longer contented to just wander the halls of the various caves, caverns and ruins of the D&D world we are now the ones sending unexpecting adventurers to their deaths and glory.

Resource gathering game, highly addictive and easy to get into. 

Reasonably friendly with no real vindictive PVP (outside of the expansion). 

Beautiful art work, great themes and many tributes to the RPG. 

If you like resource based games this is a must.

unbalanced (random) Lord assignment, unbalanced (random) quest assignment, unbalanced (random) intrigue card draw.

worst part are the 'take that' screws that people apply - randomly with the people I happened to play with.  theoretically, if they were used to reign in leaders they are viable, but I haven't seen them used that way.  with a game that doesn't have a lot of turns, getting randomly screwed takes you out of the running.

the action selection is kind of interesting, but it is really overwhelmed by all of the random things happening, as well as the other player's actions unintentionally blocking you while they do what they need to do.

RATING: 8
Pretty standard worker placement game with nothing new, but a quite good one at that. The rules are simpler than I expected, and although the board is somewhat ugly compared to the art on the cards, it is very functional.

The game goes quickly and is fairly strategic, although luck may sometimes be decisive, especially in the hidden objectives and offer of quests. If your types of quests don't show up and/or other players go for the same types, your score will suffer. And then there are the intrigue cards, which circumstantially may cause a little harm to some players and not others, or give a small benefit to a chosen player. But the mandatory quests may interfere too much with a player's plans and effectively take him out of the game, especially when played near the end. This type of intrigue card alone knocks my rating down by at least one and a half point.

Even with the rich D&D background, the game feels quite abstract, and some bad production decisions reinforce that. Buildings have just a non-descriptive name and no art, so that you have to look them up in the manual to know what they are. Adventurers are simply used as resources, gathered and spent to complete quests, and it definitely does not help that those brave heroes are represented by wooden cubes instead of the detailed plastic miniatures that you would expect from Wizards of the Coast. But being this their first foray into Euro territory, they seemly had some stupid misconception that Eurogamers adore wooden cubes and despise plastic miniatures. Well, maybe a few do, but those are probably the same who will not touch a Fantasy-themed game with a ten-foot pole, so what is the point?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A decent worker placement game. I like that the 'buildings' come out randomly and the game play decides how many actually come into play. This should 'change' the character of the game each. I, however, did find it over all to be a 'great' game, it seemed much like other worker placement games. It did probably get an additional point from me (and may see additionally play from me) because of the relatively short play and easy to teach rules.

I bought this because I love worker placement games and my wife and kids thought caylus dragged on too long. This game answered the call. Great game, which is on the light/medium side that lost about 1 hour.

The game seems casual enough until you get to the intrigues cards. being able to change the pace of the game by gather ressources faster or forcing your oponents to complete mandatory quests and thus, blocking their advancement put this game appart from other worker placement games.

Can't wait until the expansion gets here... I've also been looking at Pillars of the Earth, Manhattan Project and Euphoria. I want to know how everyone will deal with a little more meat in the game.

This is an enjoyable worker-placement game.  It's shorter and more straightforward than many other such games, despite the fact that it has quite a few pieces to it. I would describe this as a relatively light game.  One possible concern is that the quests have a lot of variation in what they cost and pay and rewards don't correlate well with costs, so there's a lot of luck involved in which quests you get.

I have vague concerns about the quests' balance, and how a player can get slightly rewarded or hosed based on whether or not their Lord overlaps with others' Lords.
That said, this is quick, clean, and very enjoyable. It is to Caylus what the D&D adventure co-ops are to Descent. That may not sound like much of a compliment to many, but I really like worker-placement, and I think that the D&D co-ops are a wonderful distillation of what is best in the genre. This isn't as good as the top-tier worker-placement games (for me, Age of Empires and Tribune), though.

Great mechanically. Don't let the theme get you. Wonderful worker placement game. It'd be higher for me if it wasn't set in the D&D universe as I'm not huge on fantasy and it's difficult to use as a gateway game for those who find D&D off putting. It really is a wonderful game. Won't trade it and for all those people who love D&D in my life ...(no one currently) this will be a wonderful stepping stone into euro gaming. Comparable to Stone Age, but the hidden end game objectives may set this game apart. The theme is really not that bad so just get over it and play this one, you won't regret it.

Wow, this is a surprisingly well executed worker placement resource collection game.  It strips those mechanics down into a very simple package, that works well. My first game took about an hour and fifteen minutes, that was with four players and a rules explanation for new players.  If it was two hours or more, I would probably be lukewarm on it, but its very fast and surprisingly well themed for a worker placement game.  

I don't think it will reach the level of critical acclaim that it deserves because the folks who really love this type of resource management game will be somewhat turned off by the artwork and theme.  The folks who are attracted to this type of artwork and theme will likely be disappointed that this isn't the game they were expecting.  Folks with a broader range of tastes will love it.

Sometimes, the theme of a game can carry it, even if the mechanics don't leave lots of room for strategy. D&D itself is perhaps the poster child for this kind of game, to the point that you don't win or lose, you just tell a story. So a D&D-themed worker placement game seems like it could really integrate a lot of theme into what is sometimes a dry genre of games. Unfortunately, that does not happen here. Not only are the mechanics rather bland and uninspired, they so take control of the game that there is no real sense of story or adventure. 

Players will place their workers on various spots around the board. The general choices are 1. Get Cubes 2. Get Money 3. Build a Building 4. Get a Quest. That last one might sound intriguing, but I assure you, it is not. Quests are simply ways to spend cubes for points. Money is used to build buildings (and sometimes in quests). Buildings create new spaces for worker placement. If this is all sounding familiar, it should. It's been done to death. The illustrations, cards, and pieces are all quite lovely so it's really a shame. The designers seemed so interested in balancing the game that they were afraid to add any really interesting wrinkles to the structure. All in all, it amounts to a boring game that is nice to look at. Shame.

Fun worker placement game but the "mandatory quest" cards introduce too much take-that, and the game doesn't really need it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
How funny -- they turned D&D into a worker-placement Eurogame!  There are buildings (like Caylus -- usable by all players, but gives the builder a bonus), quests (which are like contracts to fulfill), coins, and "resource" cubes (which represent fighters, priests, rogues, and wizards).  There are also influence cards, which can help players to get extra bonuses and/or hurt other players by stealing their resources.

There are only 8 turns, so it's important to realize that it may not be worth spending 5 turns to collect resources for a huge 25-point quest when you can complete 3 shorter quests for more points.  Sometimes it's worth doing a big quest if you can get enough cubes from completing smaller quests to help out.

Because of the 8-turn limit, and the rule that only 3 influence cards can be played each turn (because it requires a player to play a worker at one of the 3 places at Waterdeep Harbour), it's better to get influence cards early and not bother with them later.

The game seems fun, if a little random.  It's much easier to explain and play than Caylus, which is a big plus in my book.

Well as a former D&D fanboy this hits the right buttons. It's a pretty basic worker placement cube collecting game. Not a lot of depth but it's a good beginner game and it looks nice. 
It's also great to have a worker placement game where I'm not dealing with "goods" or am some sort of merchant or industrialist.

There is a little too much luck, but the match of an unusual theme (for that type of game anyway) and "intrigue cards" with a worker placement mechanism saves this one from mediocrity.
I find that the story telling aspect is weak, for a worker placement game that tells a better story I would pick Pillars of the Earth or World Without End, both games having stronger, more original engines in addition to a stronger story they unfold; yet Lords of Waterdeep brisk pacing and simple rules will appeal to a more casual audience, which is probably the target of this game.

In summary: a weaksauce worker placement game with an all too thin theme.

Fix: the extension that makes it a better game.

Intrigue cards can make a huge points difference if used late in the game. You can basically get a card that can stop someone from gaining up to 31 points,(so far the highest score I have seen is 118) if things work out for your evil plots. I am not sure if this will happen often but in my first game I had one mandatory quest played on me on the last turn(the second of them played against me in the game) that cost me 18 Victory points taking me from 4 points from victory to last. Not the best feeling but at least the game is fun and fast enough for it not to hurt too much. 

The cards you receive at the beginning of the game and intrigue cards you draw during the game can also highly influence your chance of success, obviously good play after the game is well understood will mitigate this but if you get a few bad draws in a row you will really feel it at the end of the game if all your other moves are not optimal. 

Also if you happen to get a competing Lord card with someone else it can really lower your options as you will be directly competing for certain quests while other people have free reign over the quest they want. All told though coming in dead last on my first two games, having been a victim of a shrewdly played intrigue cards and then not reacting fast enough to an opponent competing for the same quest types I think the game is quite awesome and I am looking forward to more plays. 

Lords of Waterdeep is  fast, fun and definitely not multiplayer solitaire. You can and will ruin others plans as well as block their moves. If getting your plans stomped on in the last turns of a game bugs you stay well away from this one it has teeth.

Played a couple of two player games. This game is just fun. It plays fast enough to mitigate any bad luck and is still filled with decisions that matter. If you want something heavy this is not your game.

Just had a 3 player game I am bumping up my score. The speed of this game and the ease to teach people is just great.

RATING: 9
My family and I very much enjoy this game.  It is relatively easy to learn.  It is a game that provides numerous choices per turn, which is a big plus to me for any game.

An added item of interest is the secret "lord" that you receive at the beginning of the game.  This usually makes or breaks you in the end (with the bonus they provide), so this adds an interesting aspect, as well.

The only minor downside is there is some ambiguity regarding the text of some of the cards that you will encounter and their interaction with other cards/buildings.  Mind you, most are straight-forward and will be easy to understand, but there are others that may be a little frustrating due to lack of clarity (e.g. Zoarstar and the Ambassador is one example).

Also, it would have been nice to have more "lords" included and for them to have more unique bonuses.

All in all, though, this is a game I would highly recommend.  I labeled this as "Medium" weight, but really, this is a game that can be picked up by lighter gamers, as well.

I understand this is actually just a cube pusher, but the theme being put on does make it feel slightly less abstract, even if it is just pasted on haphazardly. Still, a really fun game that is easy to get people into and has many potential paths to victory (in a limited sense).

RATING: 8
[Initial impression: 9] Wow - finally got in a first play of this with 3 players. It is a delightful combination of worker placement & resource gathering with an added layer of hidden goals & multiple routes to victory. Long-term strategy is important, foregoing high-point short-term rewards for low value plot quests with lasting effects. Reminds me of favorites Caylus & Le Havre, but feels much lighter than either of these due to the theming. Perhaps most similar to the highly rated (but personally loathed) Agricola, due to the player-specific effects of the quest and intrigue cards, but questing through a kingdom is so much more appealing than growing a farm. I can easily see this becoming one of my few 10s if future plays remain this much fun.

Dropping this to an 8 after a few more plays. The Lord cards seem well-balanced, but some Intrigue cards are much more desirable than others, making the Intrigue-heavy strategies hit-or-miss depending on card draws. If one player is dealt the Lieutenant quest as a first card and completes it early, there goes the game. All in all, the card draws end up unbalancing the game a bit too often for my tastes. Still much more accessible and fun than other similar games, but I ultimately prefer the experience of Caylus or Le Havre.

Superb. It just plays perfectly for a very wide and etherogenic audience. At heart it is a light and enjoyable Euro-style game, but the Forgotten Realms theme in which it is bathed makes it a gem worth acquiring for every D&D aficionado out there. The quality of the components is off-chart (You just need to take a look at the game once arranged inside the box to know what I'm talking about). The main board is simply beautiful, and so are every player's side board. The cards and tokens are sturdy, colorful, dreamy. The gameplay is light but deep, replayability is guaranteed by the game's modularity, and the interaction between players is frequent, but not so "direct" to make it aggressiveness. A must buy if you like board games.

RATING: 8
Easy to play worker placement game and boy this game can really change late game as players can get random cards which are unexpectedly playable when they were not early of the game. 

I would highly recommend this game for euro gamers who loves worker placement. However in this game having an additional Meeples may not necessarily be beneficial to players as there are only 7 turns in this game but it probably take you four turns to gain that extra Meeple. I have never seen anyone playing this game winning with extra Meeples to date

The game has ton of components in it and i believe it has a great price / value. The rules are easy to get into but the game takes time to master. I kind of feel like playing Stone Age which i like a bit more beacuse of the better theme and much more colourful artwork. They are both worker placement games while in Stone Age you are improving your efficiency in this game you will be facing with much more options to choose from. If im asked to play this one i will happily say yes. However this is a great game but with Stone Age on my shelf i won't buy it.

Pros / Cons:
-Interesting to see of using worker placement in such a new way.
-Ton of components with great price / value.
-With this one you are going to have an interesting  hour to spend.

-With Stone Age on my shelf i won't buy it. Stone Age is a better game and these two feel like almost the same.

just another workerplacement game. the D&D theme is barely pasted on. if I wanted to play an entry level WP game I'd play something else entirely. People who are trying to "Evangelise the Hobby" like it because it's low entry level. but I've been playing games with my friends for nigh on twenty years so I feel I've moved beyond gateway games with my regular gamers and my GF's friends need dutch rules and the whole fantasy theme will work against it as well.

(05/2012) This is not a bad game, but I can't help but think it is nothing more than a re-themed, standard "generic" worker placement Euro, reminiscent of Le Harve and Agricola. The workers (agents) go and collect resource cubes (fighters, clerics, magicians, thieves) and/or money, which are then turned in to complete quests (to get VP and/or more stuff). You can also buy buildings, which give you stuff when someone else visits them, a la Le Harve. Unvisited buildings sometimes begin accumulating more stuff, sort of like Agricola or like "juicing" the unselected roles in Puerto Rico.

There is no novel mechanism to discover; there is nothing new here--it's all been done before. The theme is unashamedly, blatantly pasted-on. Sure, the artwork is pretty good, but whether it is D&D or sci-fi, it doesn't matter, as the game mechanisms are familiar and comfortable.

Strangely, that is where the game succeeds, in its utter familiarity. It's like the back of one's hand; it's "safe". I don't have to figure out how to game some complex mechanism; I just need to play the game and maximize my few actions, and foil the plans of my opponents. Just like any other generic Euro.

It's like vanilla ice cream. It's familiar taste that you grew up with. It's not the greatest flavor in the world--it's not Rocky Road--and you're not going to go out of your way to get it, but you know you'll like it. If someone offers you a dish of vanilla ice cream, are you going to complain? No, you wouldn't (unless you hate vanilla for some reason).

It's a solid, respectable '7', and there's nothing wrong with that.

THIS BETTER NOT SUCK

UPDATE:  DOES NOT SUCK

After a weak-willed impulse buy at my FLGS and a single play, I'm impressed.  The attention to detail on the physical design of the box and bits is breathtaking; the insert, especially, is a work of art.  Everything has a perfect place and comes out of that perfect place exactly the way you'd expect it to—in other words, you reach for the thing and touch it and it hops out of its slot and into your hand.  This, in itself, is brilliant.  Like an amusement park for opposable thumbs.

As for those bits themselves, they are wonderfully tactile and gorgeous, like the gold pieces which, while unusually shaped (squares for singles and larger crescents for fives, all with a hole punched in the middle), are also double-sided with heads and tails having unique, baroque designs.  The card art is very good and goes a long way to immerse one in theme.

This is the first worker-placement/trade-crap-for-other-crap "Euro" that fulfilled my need for a li'l somthin' extra, namely to not get stuck thinking in terms of grinding for nibs to trade for nobs and then scoring for dinguses.  The "take that" cardplay is fun in a way that anal retentive geniuses cannot countenance; fair enough, but when I played "Free Drinks!" to lure a critical wizard away from another player's tavern and into my own I learned the folly of wizards too fond of the bottle—a return play of "Arcane Mishap" caused him to detonate during a "spirited" demonstration of magical power.  I was cleaning innards and singed beard bristles out of the crevices for [i]weeks[/i].

On the mechanical side the game is quick and breezy, with occasional bursts of multi-ply puzzling to keep it engaging.  I've only played once, doing very poorly until the endgame where I managed to crawl into second place by paying attention to chaining opportunities while simultaneously dropping tactical turds into various punchbowls.  I enjoyed this very much.

There is a huge potential for variety in future plays, with more cards and buildings than opportunities to put them into play, as well as having them come out in a novel order each time.  Lucky synergies in one game could well be absent or significantly altered in the next.  How it all hangs together remains to be seen, but the obvious care, thought, and detail packed into it makes it an easy 8 for now. 

UP-UPDATE:  The second play had us all over the VP track coming into the final stretch; final score was 95-94-92-90.  Love it!

[b]After 11 plays:[/b]  Still going strong.  Yes, the "secret" scoring can be swingy, but really, it's not that secret (if you pay attention to what kind of quests your opponents are completing) and bank on all competent players getting somewhere around +30 points at the end.  Playing this with the same people means all our games have been annoyingly close... so much so I am getting sick and tired of LOSING BY ONE POINT.*

[size=7]*Especially when there's a bunch of table bumping and bag switching going on with the VP markers:  "Oh, I'm sorry—[i]you're[/i] blue?  Where were you again?"  And BANG lose by one point.[/size]

[b]After 15 plays:[/b]  Bumping this to a well-deserved 9.  There is an enormous and non-obvious storytelling element lurking beneath all the mechanical meeple-swapping... Open yourself to it.  And then send those poor bastards to their DOOM.

The half-headed man and his apprentice sauntered into Aurora's Realms Shop to the tinkle of fine Elven bells.  The apprentice locked the door behind them.

"We're here for our money, luv," croaked Half-Head.  

Aurora startled, looking up from her ledger, eyes wide.  "But you people were just here!"  Behind the counter, a baby cooed in its basket.

Half-Head gurgled, the only part of his laugh not taken by fire or hatchet.  "That was then.  This is now."

"I-I-" Aurora stammered, "I don't have it!"

"Stab the baby," said Half-Head.  The apprentice hesitated for a split-second, then unsheathed a rude-looking dagger.

"Oh, Gods!  No!" Aurora shrieked.

"Easy, luv," said Half-Head, "you've plenty of healing potion here.  The baby'll be fine.  But [i]you[/i], you need to learn a lesson..."[/q]

The only reason they make your forehead veins stand out as you poop yourself a little is because [i]you didn't plan for them.[/i]  Always assume Mandatory Questage and prepare for it, whether by salting away materiel or factoring an action/turn cushion into all of your plans—[i]especially the critical ones.[/i]  Ending up in the embarrassingly pantsless position of only having exactly what you need to pull off that 25-pointer at the very end and getting royally hosed by a single small Mandatory Quest is not a design flaw or a moral failing of the person who played the card—[i]the fault is entirely your own.[/i]

The D&D is slapped on top of this worker placement style game, but in a great way.  DO NOT buy this for an RPG experience, but works amazingly well in the genre it is actually in!  

This is by far, my favorite game in its class.  Its fantastic and easy to play, quick to pick up and engaging.  It has just enough complexity in options to bring a deep gaming experience and plays better with more players.  

Highly recommended.

This was my intro to worker placement games, and I loved it. My enthusiasm faded a bit after only a few plays, as it is fairly light and not very thematic. I do still enjoy it, and introduced it to my best friend. For a long time we played it once a week. The number of plays logged here is only a fraction of how many plays this game has gotten! While I'll generally reach for something deeper and more thematic, once in awhile I still break this out when I feel like something lighter, and it will be one of the first ones I reach for to play with non-gamers as an alternative to Catan, etc.

I'm on the side of the fence that thinks Waterdeep is thematic. This is an ideal game weight with lots of polish and production value- a gateway game not only for it's straightforward mechanics, but also as a showcase for what can be done with cardboard and wood. Waterdeep benefits from having a back catalog of available art to fill every single card with gorgeous paintings. It's almost too good. I've added a bunch of upgrades like custom meeples, metal coins, and a custom insert. 

+Really good art and style
+Interesting choices and decisions
+Minor hidden scoring and deception
-I never get the impression the game is expertly balanced; instead relying on random draws to nullify power creep.

This is a great worker placement game with good competition.  You can mess with the other players with clever agent placement and intrigue cards; however, you can't screw them over too badly, which is how I like it.

The game I own I like the most, mainly because I love it (even more because of the theme) and my friends really like it a lot too.
Games range from 90-120min and are most of the times really close matches.
It's a fairly simple game that can serve as entry for other people and so far my favorite worker placement.

This game is a prettier version of Caylus.  I think it would do better without the D&D theme slapped on it.  That aside it has gotten allot of table time.  One of the head guys at WOTC gave it to Jackie after she slammed it for not having dice.

RATING: 9
Relaxing, low confrontation and beautiful artwork. Enough theme to invoke the feel of a D&D world yet no dice! 

Scoundrels of Skullport is essential upgrade because many of the base game's buildings are ponderously slow. Skullport speeds the game up with powerful and corrupt buildings for hilarious consequences. 

When one player easily pulls ahead by drinking deep into corruption, the temptation for others to tipple grows strong. Towards the end, immorality has touched everyone so there is a race to atone and rid the dark-blue corruption tokens. Suddenly all the shady players are bawling over each other into performing devout acts of piety. Funny and entertaining.

Spectacular entry into worker placement games. So great, easy for people to learn, has as much theme as the player wants, the players can be either collecting orange squares or they can be collecting warriors for their faction. Very well balanced with lots of options for players. My only complaint is that only the builder lord has a vastly different strategy built into their scoring. Everyone else is just two different types of quests.

Just replayed this with scoundrels of skullport, non-corruption module and man it's way better game. 6 people was incredibly fun

A solid, fairly light Worker Placement game set in the D&D universe. The game is quite light in theme, barely there at all, but it is a very fun game to play, despite all the negative backlash it receives with it being too simple. I use this as a gateway to deeper/heavier euros since it's really easy to teach. It has gone over very well with many people. I've yet to try the expansion, but I've heard nothing but praise. Might raise my score on it once I try it. I think Champion of Midgard might be the next step for me in relation to a meatier game. 

Still LoW is a great solid game. Adding the expansion makes it awesome

RATING: 6
A simple worker placement game, where you place workers to take coloured cubes, hoping to reach certain combos that fulfil a 'quest'. This is quite a refreshing change in an industry that seems to be sharply ramping up the complexity of Euros in an attempt to extend the design space. There is some luck, white cubes are in short supply for instance, so to fulfil a lot of piety quests you'd better hope that a building comes out that acts as a white cube multiplier. Nothing very original or inspiring here, but short enough not to outstay its welcome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Another bland worker placement game where you gather cubes to earn points. Interaction is of the absolute worst kind, blocking spaces and a massive "take that" element.

The worst part are the mandatory quest "you lose" cards which are ridiculously harsh and take away from any sense of planning that you might have had. So it becomes doubly bad - both bland and annoying.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's pretty common for people to compare worker-placement games with Caylus, whether this is warranted or not. In this case, the comparison comes from the way that buildings work; it's possible to use other player's buildings, but whoever built it gets a benefit.  It's still not "fantasy Caylus," but it is a nice, light worker placement game with some thinking and plenty of tension to it, and it's very pretty. It does seem like some of the quest cards are better than others, adding some randomness to the game. (1 play)

I can't make up my mind on Lords of Waterdeep. On the one hand, it's a well-executed worker placement game. On the other, it's almost TOO euro-y, without the depth that normally comes with it.

RATING: 8.5
I really like this game. There are so many permutations of lords, quests, and buildings that it stays fairly fresh after lots of plays. The choices aren't incredibly difficult, but the board does get crowded fast, which calls for some creativity in strategies and means you'll see new buildings in each game as people look for new options. The expansion is vital, in my opinion, and really knocks the game up. I liked this as soon as I played it the first time, and it has only grown on me since. 8.5 w/expansion, 7.5 without.

The game that won me over on worker placement mechanics. 
Edit: After playing several other WP games, I keep coming back to this one as my favorite. The theme is fun, sure, but the mechanics are just so well honed and it's really a blast to play. The one game vying for top spot was Yedo, another excellent title with tight mechanics and a great theme, but Yedo takes about twice as long to play as LW, so this one won out in the end.

RATING: 6
The game has a nice simplicity to it and it's ultimately enjoyable to play, I would rate it a vote or two higher but unfortunately certain buildings and intrigue cards are too unbalanced and can break the game from the start. I can often correctly predict who's going to win just by the first couple of turns based on the first buildings purchased and the first intrigue cards played. Because the things to do are exactly the same for everyone, gather resources, complete quests, an early start can set you a step in front of the others and there usually aren't enough comeback mechanics to bring you back on top. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Plays like My First Worker Placement Game.  Has all of the mechanical similarities to the true standouts of the genre, but none of the subtle decision making or long term strategy.  The completely pasted on theme is neither a positive nor a negative, as it has absolutely no bearing on gameplay and thus can be ignored (if it's not your thing) or used to salvage the mediocre gameplay (if it is).  I honestly don't understand the enthusiasm for this game or what makes people come back to it time and again - its replay value seems pretty limited.

Solid light worker placement game. The only thing I don't appreciate is the direct attack between players. The mandatory cards are too bad for the victim, and they are chosen just "because I want to hurt you". This kind of feeling is, in my opinion, not fun.

RATING: 8
Though the theme falls short in Lords of Waterdeep, your fighters, thieves, clerics, and wizards being simple resource cubes - the mechanics of the game are solid. Limited building space provides a rush to construct structures so you can gain benefits from others using them. But will you neglect your quests, necessary as they provide the primary function for victory points in addition to other rewards? The corruption track added in the expansion does wonders for additional player interaction, giving players an additional dimension of risk-taking.

RATING: 6
A decent medium/light worker placement game similar to Stone Age or Agricola (but lighter than Agricola).  The theme is pasted on and has nothing to do with the game.  It is a typical Euro where you take actions to collect resources, then trade those resources in various combinations for victory points, with a few hidden agendas and special cards that can be played.  We didn't feel like we were "completing quests" in a D&D atmosphere; it could have been combining ingredients to complete restaurant orders, or running around a medieval village fulfilling a king's demands, or what have you.  Not a bad game if you don't mind pasted on themes.

I guess it would work as a gateway to Euro games for people who have only played D&D (the RPG) and games on that theme (fantasy miniature games, etc), who wouldn't be interested in a game like Stone Age or Agricola based on their themes.  Otherwise, I'd rather play a better worker placement game with a stronger connection to its theme that gives a better sense of accomplishment (e.g. Ninjato, Manhattan Project, Agricola, etc), rather than mindlessly fulfilling generic set-collection requirements.

Worker placement has been one of our favourite mechanics ever since we cut our teeth on Stone Age. LOW doesn't disappoint and has the edge lately. Maybe it's the theme, or just the "newness". Our oldest son enjoys both too, but I think the theme here is the bigger draw for sure. Plays fast, just wish we could get it on the table more often.

An overrated game because of his DnD theme which has just a worker placement mechanic and nothing more. There are much older but still better and innovated worker placement games out there which is deserved to be known but so unpopular because they haven't got a DnD hype on their back. Intrigue cards are so frustrating for long term well-thougth strategies and mandatory quests have highly kingmaker issues. Nothing to explore, nothing new and interesting. Nothing.

If you're asking a worker placement and resource gathering game, there are much much better games. Lords of Waterdeep is still a simple game (without its expansions) and lacks replayability but still could be a good game for newcomers.

A typical worker placement game with Dungeons & Dragons theme. The game, Lords of Waterdeep, has simple rules. 
For this reason, the game is good for non-heavy gamers too. Nevertheless, Lords of Waterdeep also provides lots of tactical choices to players. Even strategic game geeks and heavy gamers can fully enjoy this game. Especially, a fierce interactive element of the game causes controversial and competitive situation through the game. Even though the theme is not fully assimilated into the game, the game provides high level of fun. I would like to give good score on the accessibility to absorb various gamers.

I've only played this once, but it was phenomenally fun.  While I did terrible at this game, I had as much of a blast as everyone else at the table.  The game is not at all similar to the other D&D board games, which I initially thought would be a bad thing.  Having played the game, I realize just how wrong I was.  This game has the perfect amount of theme: it doesn't feel tacked-on, but it also doesn't feel absolutely essential to the game.  One doesn't need to be a fan of D&D to enjoy this game.

A fun worker-placement strategy game. The game is lightly themed after Dungeons and Dragons, but completely enjoyable without any knowledge of the role-playing series. If the theme puts you off, try tracking down a copy of Pillars of the Earth. It scratches a similar itch without the D&D theme (though while Lords of Waterdeep can handle up to 5 or 6 players, Pillars of the Earth only supports up to 4).

[b]2 Player Review:[/b] 

Truth be told, I hadn't ventured to the realms of D&D since the likes if "Balder's Gate II". However, I feel like I had made a triumphant return with "Lords of Waterdeep". While it`s not your traditional dice rolling D&D adventure, the theme is so strong and well presented you really feel like you're there. 
The core game plays in under an hour, and managing your heroes and buildings while screwing with your partner via intrigue cards is a perfect mix. 
My only complaint is that the hidden lord system is flawed in that your partner can figure you out in about 2 rounds and can work to sabotage you accordingly. Luckily this is a problem that was quickly fixed in the expansion. 
Pick it up if you like resource management and a really impressively immerse theme. It`s just a little light compared to the other great worker-placement games out there with much more inventive mechanics. 

[b]Expansion Review:[/b] 

While the new mechanics do pretty much double the length of each session, the corruption, new locations and especially new lords, add an incredible amount of depth to an already outstanding game.
While the core game was frustrating when you knew you would loose from a poor start and a low score, I have had sessions in "Scoundrels of Skullport" where I won when 100 points behind. I played my lord carefully and managed to rid myself of corruption while increase it's cost in my opponent's tavern, and ended up winning by 3 points.
I honestly won't be going back to the core game again unless introducing a casual game to the ropes.
A MUST buy for anyone a fan of the core game.

[b]Pros:[/b]

- A great gateway game for fantasy buffs.
- Collecting house and heroes is great fun.
- The expansion adds a lot of depth and managing corruption keeps the game tense up greatly until the very end.

[b]Cons:[/b]

- The game is light and the theme, while great, wears off after several plays.
- The expansion is a great addition to mechanics, but it doubles the play time and make the game feel drawn out by the end.

Smooth gameplay and quick playtime make this worker placement game a winner with me.  The theme is admittedly a bit pasted on, but it does not lessen the fun factor.  If you're looking for a dungeon crawler because of the D&D license, of course you're going to be disappointed.  If, however, you're looking for a much less dry version of a standard worker placement game this one will satisfy.

Bon jeu de worker placement pas trop difficile à apprendre.  Selon les cartes qui sortent c'est là que la partie ce joue.  Partie assez rapide en 8 tours.  Bonne composante carte, jeton, block de bois.  à plus que 3 on se pile pas mal sur les pieds sur le tableau bon feeling de proximité avec les autres.  Les carte intrigues sont parfois ordinaire mais quand tu en a des bonnes ça va améliorer assez rapidement les chances de faire de bon move.  Le thème est correct mais on le sent pas.  On aurait pu avoir un autre theme avec le même matériel.  Je l'aime mieux que Alien frontiers.

Solid mechanics, nice components, OK-to-boring solitaire-ish gameplay. For all the attempt at theme, I didn't feel like I was doing anything more than collecting sets of cubes. But then I've just never been that enamored with most worker placement games. Also, I usually don't like it when everyone has secret "get extra points for doing such and such" cards (everyone gets one of these at the start of the game), as that tends to add to the feeling of "doing my own thing, don't really know or care what the other players are doing" that I don't like in many worker placement games.

The theme really seems ancillary, but Lords of Waterdeep is a good enough game not to suffer because of this. The rules are so simple that you don't need to think about them - instead you can concentrate fully on planning and tactics. The interaction between players is often subtle but is an important component of the game. Having said this, the game loses its shine after a few plays as it is not variable or compelling enough (without the expansion).

Pretty bleh.

The "Lords" are utterly unbalanced.  They builder lady is completely useless...I can't see ever winning with her when all the others are easily generating 24+ points simply by picking up quests.

Certainly I'd never play again with her in AND the Intrigue cards that let people steal buildings.  Those are the only way to take VPs from somebody in this game, and they slaughtered me with them.  

It doesn't help that this WP game is average at best.

I really enjoy worker placement games, and this one is one of the best. I like the theme (you play as rival lords in a Dungeons and Dragons city wrestling for power, hiring adventurers to go out and complete quests), and I enjoy the execution. The game moves at a quick pace as well, since each player takes turns placing one agent at a time, rather than playing out their entire turn at once before the next person gets to go. Definitely a favorite.

I avoided playing this for some time, just because its reputation of pasted theme and very light game play, and seemed to be very overrated, which after playing I would confirm all that. HOWEVER, I liked it much more than I thought I would (expectations were low), the main thing that saves the game for me anyway is the time to play matches what it delivers, it’s a light medium weight game, so 90 minutes or more would have been too long and that is what I thought it was from what I knew. It turns out its only 45 to 60 mins, and could probably be churned out in 30 I bet with a few plays and that is a great length for the game.  

Great theme "present"(for D&D nuts), its not fully pasted I guess but close, I mean you really aren’t adventuring around completing quests and definitely don’t get the feel you are either even though this was the intention.  Its really a WP contract filling euro game, that moves quick, and gives you interesting enough decisions to make with how to score, and has a nice theme “present”.  I’d play again, and oddly enough would consider picking it up for good price just because its quick

The mechanic is light and straight forward. With only two basic things to do -- place workers and spend resources -- the game has a lot of variety in the details.

This is a good game. I have no doubt about that. It is clean and plays nicely. It does, however have a bit of trouble with player interaction where the only form of interaction other than denial (which is fine) is just a bit too mean spirited, especially if everyone just targets the person who appears to be in the lead with their malicious quests. We would have played it a lot more if the other worker placement game Agricola wasn't such a favorite. I'm sure if we had meeples instead of cubes or if the art was "cuter" it would have been a keeper.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Best worker placement I've played yet. The theme adds quite a bit to what is already a solid game, but does not require the players to be invested in the theme in order to enjoy it. Biggest complaint is the lack of variety in the Lord cards, as only one does not revolve around quests and the artwork for them all is generally bad.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Nothing wrong with it I guess, but there's really nothing going on either. Probably the simplest possible worker placement there is. Your options are essentially take cubes, or take cards that let you trade cubes for points. There are some minor twists from this, but that's basically it. I don't really see a reason to ever play this over a host of other games, but it's not unpleasant and I can imagine finding myself in a group who wants to play it and just going along with it.

Lords of Waterdeep is at its base a competent but uninspired worker placement Euro game. The game is so simplistic it doesn't provide the satisfaction of creating an engine, building sophisticated combos, or anything that makes modern Euro games enjoyable. The majority of the game is simply acquiring resources, turning in said resources for points, and repeating.

The game tries to spice things up with Intrigue cards. The intent is to make surprising moments and impressive plays. The result is that they ruin the game, introducing wild swings of luck and the ability for players to attack others with, unlike most Euro games, little cost in doing so. There is nothing enjoyable about having to spend precious turns re-acquiring resources or completing mandatory quests only because another player happened to draw a card and decided that should happen.

Combined with a pasted-on theme - this game could be about any activity where one acquires resources and turns them in for points - and it makes for a game I will never play again.

I was worried when I heard it described as like Caylus (having read the same thing online).  I'm not a fan of Caylus.  But this was all right.  I didn't like the special missions that can be played on opponents via Intrigue cards (aka mandatory quests), but the other interactive stuff was pretty inoffensive.  It's not the type of game I'll want to play a lot, but maybe from time to time.

borrows from other games (such as caylus w/buildings and worker placement) so nothing really original but seems to come together relatively well.  luck in intrigue cards and which quest cards come up make it light/medium weight compared to games like caylus or even the  worker placement game that I believe started the current worker placement design element, ie. leonardo da vinci.

Worker placement where you take on the role of one of the lords of waterdeep trying to build up your empire. Send your agents to recruit warriors, mages, rogues, and clerics to go out and complete quests to earn you fame and glory while establishing your foothold in Waterdeep.

The scoundrels of skullport expansion almost feels like a must have for the game and adds madness as well as spots in skullport harbor and the undermountain to place your workers (and possibly lose your sanity).

Solid basic worker placement game.  I don't really understand the comparisons to Caylus - it is worker placement, and you benefit when someone else uses your buildings, and you use cubes to "build" quests.

But the buildings and quests come out randomly, there are hidden victory conditions, and the forms of interaction are significantly different.

Where does this game stand out?  It has simple rules, with essentially no space for confusion.  The randomness can help give you direction, and there are some means of mitigating it.  The amount of luck is congruent with the length of the game.  Some direct player interaction is a good thing.

In the end, I am not entranced by this game.  It is like going to the Olive Garden and ordering the carbonara.  It is not going to knock your socks off, but it'll be a perfectly decent dish capable of being enjoyed.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (October 2012)

Lords of Waterdeep is a, somewhat, light worker placement game. I do like worker placement games so I, more or less, like it but this is not a game I wish to play often.

The box of the game is very well designed with its open lids (I hope more games came like this), and the art is pretty cool. The game is hugely thematic IF you happen to know about the backstory, otherwise, much of the thematic atmosphere is lost but it is nice to have a worker placement with a fantastic theme. (I have not played Belfort).

On the good side, the game is very easy to teach, it plays very quickly and without any isue so there is almost no downtime. The game is very well done and it can be a good game to introduce to new gamers. The components are pretty and the overall quality of the game is very high.

On the bad side, the game is too light for my taste and it has a annoyingly high luck factor (due to the events, buildings, and intrigue cards) that decided our game. Sometimes you will get lucky and be able to get a good combo, other times you won’t (no matter how many times you change the event deck :angry:). Also as you can only build one building each round, sometimes (a lot of times) you won’t be able to get what you want. I felt I didn’t have much control over the game, the best you can do is to put yourself in a position where, if lucks wills it, you can take advantage of the right mix of cards. 

Also there are some cards (intrigue, events, buildings) that are much more powerful than others so it is luck if you can draw them or not. 

And that’s my main gripe about the game. Bottom line I felt the game has a lot of unfair elements without any way to mitigate them and that is awful to have in a strategy game.

Lords of Waterdeep is an ok game but not for me. I don’t feel the urge to play it again, but I’m sure I will play it in the future if I’m in the mood. For now I prefer to play Agricola, Caylus, Pret a Porter or pretty much any other worker placement game I have played.

Nowadays I’m playing Lords of Waterdeep a lot, but only on the iPad. In this format, the game weaknesses bother me a lot less as the game play time is critically reduced. Still LoW is not a game I will ever buy. Way too light for me, have lots of uncontrolled luck and most of its decisions are obvious.

Current Rating: 5.0

I played the game face to face again. This time with the full complement of 6 players (with the expansion) which was very bad as the downtime was excessive. I think LoW is best for 3 players. I have written it before, but the Intrigue cards are way too unbalanced. In every one of my games, luck has decided the winner. The game is very obvious and I also dislike the “attack the leader” mechanic with the mandatory quests. It is luck if you can get one of them or not.

What an average worker placement game.  There is nothing wrong with it but the theme is irrelevant and the mechanics are nothing special.  It's not a waste of time but far from the one standouts of the genre

RATING: 8.75
Loads of fun. Leaves you wanting to play more. Finally a euro-style game with a rich interesting theme !! Game mechanics are incredibly simply - get a quest, collect cubes that match quest, turn in quest for points - however, the complexity is ratcheted up with the expansions and are a must have.  Further, the simplicity is where the game shines.  It is incredibly thematic, simple, but elegant fun and strategic. There is a lot to think about in terms of order of actions, blocking opponents, secret bonus conditions, the purchase of buildings that provide you a benefit if others use it. The amount of meaningful and even at times complex choices and decisions add a surprising amount of depth to this deceptively "simple" game.  A great gateway game, but also a great gamer's game. The IOS app is also a fantastic implementation of the game. While stand the test of time and is one of the greats.

This is  one of the first big tabletop games that I've fallen in love with. Before Waterdeep, I had mostly played deckbuilders and the occasional game of Catan. I love strategy video games so this worked for me as well.

This game really showed me the wonders of modern tabletop gaming. It's simple and easier to set up that meets the eye. There's so much excitement at the end of the game when one of your bonus quests just barely gives you the win. 

It's a good game to introduce friends into intermediate strategy in tabletop. Play a few rounds of a lesser strategy game and then bump it up to this if you have a new group.

As I've played this game a few more times my rating has come down a bit.  The theme is pasted on but at least it's an enjoyable one.  The game is neat looking as well.  I'm a big worker placement fan but there's something about this one...I can't put my finger on it but for some reason I prefer Stone Age and Homesteaders to this one.  If you were on the fence about this game and needing a worker placement game for your collection I'd go with one of the aforementioned games or give Village a chance (I've not played it yet but I'm excited to).

A great gateway game. I played it a few times after Catan. It taught me about worker placement games and got me into more complex games. I don't have much desire to play it these days. Not because it's a bad game. Just because my group prefer more complex games. I would recommend to someone just getting into board games. Or someone who hasn't played a worker placement and wants to work up to more complex Euro games.

Fun, but play is 99% on the app these days.  (By the way, the app is top notch!  I with there were more high quality turn-based apps like this.)  I feel the theme comes through just fine, but I'm familiar with the D&D setting.  Luck of the draw, a variety of not equal hidden scoring objectives, and take-that can make it seem light on strategy, but there is absolutely strategy required and a need to understand your opponents.  The expansion is almost necessary at this point because it adds so much variety and the corruption mechanism.

RATING: 4.5
Yes, I do see the usefulness of this game that it is a very easy worker placement game for beginners. But as a guy who was fairly experienced with heavy worker placement games, I was expecting more when I was getting into this game. I came into the game with the wrong mind-set, and it is influencing scoring heavily. Then again, scores that I give are subjective - and I rate them based on how much I want to play them so 5 is where it is going to sit for now.

I would have forgo how light the game is if the theme has been executed extremely well but no. Theme here is just a paste - cube pusher. You can call the cubes a wizard...or whatever but it's boring. You could have just retheme'd this game into Blacksmithing game where you collect different colored ores to forge different magical weapons to gain points. Yap, boring.

I don't see much appeal to play this once somebody introduces anyone to better worker placement games out there.

RATING: N/A
A decent game but a little to dry for the theme it is trying to portray.  Just played a 5 player game with expansions that probably went on a little to long and some of the points do feel like they come along in big jumps. Despite that the game does a good job of the worker placement genre.

In Lords of Waterdeep, you take on the role of one of the masked Lords of Waterdeep, secret rulers of the city. Through your agents, you recruit adventurers to go on quests on your behalf, earning rewards and increasing your influence over the city. Expand the city by purchasing new buildings that open up new actions on the board, and hinder – or help – the other lords by playing Intrigue cards to enact your carefully laid plans. At the end of 8 rounds of play, the player who has accrued the most points wins the game.

Fun worker placement game. I think I'd prefer if they found a way to more tightly couple it with the theme (some way to make me think of rogues as rogues, instead of just black cubes).

The D&D theme is a bit pasted on. Preferred to have material resembling actual adventures instead of colored cubes, but price wise this choice is understandable.

All in all a solid game.

Although the game is themed by D&D, it doesn't have a D&D feel at all. Lords of Waterdeep goes into what happens behind the scenes of our RPG adventures. Players are patrons. Yes, WE are the ones adventurers seek when they go off hunting for excuses to loot and/or kill. In Lords, players draw the quests and send their agents off to recruit the fighters, rogues, wizards and priests to complete them. There is no combat in this game, no adventure, and no leveling.

Players have 2-3 workers (agents) to place on spaces that allow them to select quests, recruit adventurers, make money, draw intrigue cards, or play them. You can also build buildings that allow for different combinations of actions. The object is to get points. You primarily get points by completing quests (by paying cube and money combinations on quest cards), but there are many smaller opportunities to get points through actions and intrigue cards as well. After 8 turns, the game is over.

Basically, we have a quick-playing, card-driven worker-placement game. Worker-placement games give you a limited number of actions and wide variety of choices. Their strength is in the variety of actions and paths you can take, while at the same time blocking or limiting your opponents' choices. The objectives for Waterdeep are limited - you get points by completing sets of cubes (representing the different adventurer types) and money - but the particulars change every game by the order in which the cards come up. I think this is one of the better strategically light worker-placement games I've played. The length, about an hour, is just right for the depth.

I expected this game to be better. It's good, in fact a really good game. My entire family loved playing it. However, something about it just doesn't pull me in.

Maybe it's the fact that you complete all these quests and the theme is such a big part of the game, but I never actually felt like I was a Lord of Waterdeep.

Actually, the more I think about it, the hidden character cards are the worst part of the game and the one aspect that is supposed to drive the tension. I would rather see more scarcity of resources, I think.

Regardless, this is a good game and really fun with 5 players.

An excellent worker placement game that isn't difficult to understand, yet offers plenty of choices.  The theme also works perfectly here, even if it is slightly under-represented.  My pick for game of the year 2012.

For whatever reason, I don't ever find it particularly exciting going in, but it just manages to do everything so well that, by the end of the game, I always end up saying, "this is such a great game."  I think it may have to do with superb balance, but i need to explore further. 

The expansion has added a lot of value to this one for me.  Gone up almost a full point. perhaps further.

I like it a lot! Definitely a game better than the sum of its parts. Nothing groundbreaking, but the overall result is pleasing. Although the strategy is not always evident, and there are some tough choices to make, the state of the game is always quite clear to the players: there is no mental bookkeeping to do and the actions have clear impacts. In other words, nothing is obfuscated in this game, it flows smoothly.

The game system has good potential for expansions due to its card nature (and the buildings), so I think future expansions can add to the theme and rectify the abstraction of the base game.

Collect resources by placing workers as efficiently as possible to use to fulfill quest cards for victory points. Mostly this is fun, but there are potential annoyances. You get a bonus for completing a certain goal. This is hidden from others, so you may end up competing with someone for the same quest type. Fighting over who gets the start player can be annoying. The bonus card for most buildings seems too generous since they already tend to gain extra resources. Also there is the randomness of what quests come out. If you don't get ones toward your bonus you may end up behind at the end.

I was initially really excited about this game. The production is good, I like the art, the rules seem straight forward and fun. The problem is that there is nothing special about this game, the mechanics all work but they all work better in other games. I don't feel drawn to playing it there aren't enough novel decisions or unique elements to encourage the choice of this game over others.

I could see RPG-types finding their way to Euros with this game, but for those of us engrossed in the boardgame community this game has little to offer. I also really don't like the hidden scoring in this game, I don't mind that it's hidden I just think they choose boring objectives to give people.

Inoffensive light weight Euro with some take that cards. Combine stuff to fufill order cards, pretty theme-less, instantly forgettable.

Just not good enough. 

To clarify this game is functional, but there really is no need to play it over its inspiration. This title is pure 'product' to fill a gap in the market from Wizards. This is what I object to - as art it is creatively bankrupt and lazy. The source material is entirely disrespected and the whole production feels lowest common denominator. if this is the future of eurogames then thank goodness that there are many designers moving away from this paradigm towards combining other genres into these mechanics because this evolutionary tree is a dead end.

I have played this game once now and would be ok never playing it again. It's fun but entirely too light for me. There is no theme. Don't let anyone else tell you otherwise. You could easily replace this game with any other theme and nothing would really change. Seriously pirates, space, Cthulhu, you name it. 

My main problem with it is that there is simply not enough complex strategies. The game kind of just tells you what to do. It's still fun but the most ideal decision is usually right in front of you. I don't think I will learn anything new playing this 100 more times. If you want a worker placement game you could play with your mom then get this one otherwise I would stay away.

Uneven production - beautiful art for the card faces (which I have to assume is recycled from other D&D properties) with bog-standard card backs and a dour, grey board. Terrific thematic cardboard money, with simple cubes to represent the "heroes" of the game.

Underneath the suspect looks though, the game plays as a very smooth introductory worker-placement game. Furthermore, there's very little in the way of meaningful player interaction - only the denial of placement, and some tacked-on take-that mandatory quest. The root of the issue is that there's nothing in LoD that will challenge an experienced board gamer, so there's subsequently little investment in the game, leading to a shallow (though mercifully brief) experience. 

Nice as a gateway, or as a break on those occasions where the brain is already burnt, but nothing that I'm going to be clamouring to play. The expansion adds some new placement spaces and a bit of a push-your-luck element with the corruption, but nothing that addresses the issues I have with the base game.

A lot has been made of the D&D theme, and I didn't think it was particularly strong, which was a good thing for me. It's a pretty fun worker placement game. The one thing I didn't really like is I wish there was more variety in the lords.

Lords of Waterdeep is what I expected it to be: a random destillation of worker placement games with an added screwage factor respectively a popularity contest and few interesting decisions. Considering, that worker placement games aren't my favourite genre and my dislike for targeted negative interaction in games, the only positive thing about LoW is its merciful brevity for this genre.

Okay worker placement; okay theme. But something about the decision making doesn't feel like its creating an engine or gaining control of the city. Instead, it feels like a series of placements which maybe end with you having the most points.

It's nothing extraordinary, but the D&D theme is not completely pasted on, and the themey-ness spruces up what are otherwise recycled mechanics. In the one play I participated in, I shot from sixth to second on final scoring, and the person who won was generally fairly far behind, so it would seem that the goal is just to keep in the VP hunt during most of the game. Lots of games do this--Ninjato is similar in this respect, for example--but this game seemed particularly swingy, and not in a way that had me enthralled.

Deserving of its popularity.  This is a game that is a hit with my casual gaming friends.  May not have enough strategic depth to sustain the more hardcore gamers in your group, but definitely a fun game at its core.  The D&D theme is arguably unnecessary as beneath that theme is a strong worker placement game that could've been layered with other themes with the same strong result.  However, for D&D fans, the theme will be an asset.  It may keep non-D&D fans away from an otherwise fun experience though, which would be a shame.  This is overall a really fun game

Fantastic game!  Euro-style worker placement with plenty of twists and replay-ability. Excellent box design, components are of good quality, with good story and consistent theme.  The game is fun for all.  Last place still wins, as it is time well spent having fun with friends.  Not a cut-throat game, very few direct attacks, though as it is resource placement it is possible to single someone out to slow them down.

RATING: 5
A light thematic take on a Euro worker placement.

First, what I like about it. It plays quickly and it doesn't bog down with analysis paralysis. It would be a good teacher to worker placements. I would recommend this to a lot of people. The intrigue cards really are a neat mechanic.

But what don't I like about it? I find the theme to be very poorly implemented. The components and mechanics all just seem disjointed. I find the hidden role cards to be absolutely terribly implemented. They are almost all just different takes of the same thing and dictate too much of who will or won't win. If two players share the same extra point quests, the third player will win almost every time. Next, the quests that are available are too random, vital and they fluctuate too often to be either tactically or strategically viable - which is where you'll earn the vast majority of your points. 

I gladly will play this game with other people, but I think the game is shallow, the point swings are manic-depressive, and the quests' relationship with the hidden roles are too important and too driven by chance.

With the expansion, this is elevated to "great" though.

A perfectly cromulent game. I like how quickly it moves and seems to offer the right balance between luck and strategy that should make this a winner with all but the most hardcore gamers. 

The theme doesn't get in the way and is almost laughable in its implementation. If this had a different theme I could see this game being a favorite, but as it is, with the D&D theme this should be a game that's fun to play every once in a while.

Despite the fact that its all been done before, this worker placement is quite unique. The various components gel really well and make for a fun game. Players take the roles of Lords who are recruiting adventurers to complete quests.

Even if you can't appreciate the theme (fairly pasted on), I reckon the game system is great, the right mixture of take-that cards and multiple paths to victory.

Looks like an ordinary worker placement, but it has some attraction to it. Nice graphics? Sure. It is certainly more thematic than some other worker placement games (e.g., Stone Age). But none of these things are big advantages in my house. Well, I'll have to play more to understand, what I like in it.

Atrodo kaip paprastas darbininkų statymo žaidimas, bet kažkuo jis traukia. Gražia grafika? Žinoma. Be to, jis tikrai yra tematiškesnis už kai kuriuos kitus darbininkų statymo žaidimus (pvz., Stone Age). Bet nė viena iš šių savybių man nėra didelis privalumas.

Have played 7 times now, with 2-4 players.  I like it, its light and fun, doesn't take all night.  If you lose, you can easily suggest shuffling up and dealing it out again and starting over.

Some of the Intrigue cards cause a lot of grumbling (mandatory quests) but we haven't modified the deck or anything yet.  

It probably won't see the most play at the table but I'm still hoping to get a chance to teach my non gamer family.  They prefer Catan and Carcassonne at this time, didn't get a chance to try to introduce this yet.

Well, had friends come over and caught them up on Game of Thrones S2 Ep1-3, went to dinner and then we tried Lords of Waterdeep.
Once we got through the painful process of understanding what to do in a turn, it started moving quite nicely, and in the end we all really enjoyed it and are already planning on playing it in 2-3 weeks when we meet again for more GoT.

The box set up is nice, packaging is nice, I really like the coating on the cards, has a rough non glare finish.  The pieces themselves are wood and simple and seem to be the only weakness in the packaging, everything else appeared top notch. 
So I would give it a 4.5 out of 5, and a definitely try it out award.
Playtime seems to be around 90 minutes, but will know better next time since we were slow at the start.

Oh and most importantly, I WON!

Its a pure and straightforward workerplacement - I would almost call it a gateway game just from its simplicity.

Yet the expansions provided enough interesting options and spiced up the Lords with some alternative winning conditions which keeps you second guessing what they are actually running for. Its not overly complicated and there might be a slight inbalance towards the high value Quests which provide up to 40 points at once, which can lead to some lopsided results if not countered by your fellow lords.

I still like to play this and love the custom insert which comes with the game. All games should have an insert like that.

Without the expansion, this is a very vanilla Worker Placement game. The intrigue cards do bring something that not many other WPs do, but I don't see why you'd play LoW (without the expansion) instead of Russian Railroads, Lancaster, or some other, top tier WPs.

The expansion, however, makes it one of my favorites.

Good, quick playing worker placement/resource management game with a working D&D background. Intrigue cards help throw more uncertainty into the mix of considerations as to what to do next. Advanced buildings come out in a different order each game and some never appear in a particular game at all. So, if you like games where you know all the right moves before the game begins, then this is not going to work for you. But if you like a level of uncertainty that forces you to react ingame to unforseeable events and use your resources accordingly, then this game does that, and very well.

RATING: 5.5
Lords of Waterdeep is... OK? It's OK. It's an OK game. Mechanically, it is OK. It's nice, it's pleasant, it's pretty relaxing as far as worker placement games go.

I'm a D&D player from small times, and I was big into the Forgotten Realms books when I was younger, but the theme of Lords of Waterdeep really does feel paper-thin. Some of it works, but the mechanic of recruiting adventurers and sending them on quests really feels just like buying resources and spending them on victory points. Maybe some character meeples would help, but that particular part of the game just does not click with me.

The board itself, the intrigue cards, and the the buildings feel a lot more cohesive to me, and perhaps the theme would feel better-integrated if the worker placement were more focused on changes to the city itself rather than the quests which feel imported from a different world.

The final nail in the coffin (that's a bit dramatic, I won't refuse to play Lords of Waterdeep but I will not suggest it) is that the worker placement almost never feels weighty. There are usually a few places that are equally attractive, and there is so little tension behind the choices. I like a bit of stress in my worker placement plays—Lords of Waterdeep doesn't manage to work it up very well.

Pretty basic but good worker placement game and the perfect example of how much good components matter. If played with the components in the box it boils down to "I spend two black cubes and a white one to get two orange ones, some money and some points." When playing with the DnDeeples this changes to "I'm sending out my two thieves and a priest. On their quest they earn me some money and glory and convince two warriors to join my cause."

I enjoyed this game, however I was put off by the seemingly unbalancedness of the quests. Some of the quests and intrigue cards are nearly game breaking when used in combination, and there is far more luck involved than I would like for a euro. On the other hand, it takes the D&D theme and turns it into a surprisingly fun cube pusher. I would probably play this more often if not fr the existence of Yedo, which does almost the exact same things but considerably better.

I'm not ready to rate it yet (I don't want the "newness" to cloud my judgements :) ) but I have enjoyed all 3 of my games thus far, immensely.  And any game featuring James LeBrie must be perfect, huh?

The game is simple to learn, my 9 year old boy won in his only game (3 player vs. me and the wife)!

Yet, the options are many, strategies (end game Lord?  questing? building/balanced?) varied and the outcome isn't decided until the very end.

It plays fast, both turn to turn and in total time.

It has a D&D feel in general, but is clearly a Euro.  That has NOT affected our enjoyment at all!

I have played with gamers and the family with just as good results; a real winner here!

And it is certainly easily expanded, what with new quests, hero classes, Lords, buildings, Intrigue cards, etc.  Maybe a "Dungeon" space where you can "gamble" heroes from your tavern away for some big rewards...treasure, VPs, gold, Monsters that act as wilds for questing, etc.

Could be a 9 when all is said and done...

Lords of Waterdeep isn't just a euro, it's a bone-dry, Caylus/A Castle for All Seasons/Fresco-type game. Strange, since the theme should lend a bit more flavor. Sadly, the D&D is all in the names on the cards; everywhere else, it feels like a derivative retheme of better and more involving games. It does only last an hour, which is an unusually quick playtime for this type, and it reflects the care the WotC gang put into it. But there are better games out there of this type.

This game has a completely pasted on D&D theme and has no business being as good as it is.  Whether by brilliant design or lucky accident this is an extraordinary worker placement game.  Works great as a first worker placement for those new to the hobby but definitely offers enough for seasoned gamers to enjoy over and over.  Seems to play exactly long enough to accomplish everything you needed to do but never enough time to do everything you wanted to do.

The plastic insert for storage of the pieces is as good as you will find anywhere but the box is stupid and hard to store because if you turn the box vertically all those pieces come tumbling out of the beautiful insert, and the lid doesn't close properly.

This is one of the best representation of the worker placement genre. I like the growing number of buildings. The progression of chaining quest rewards to complete the next one feels rewarding and satisfying. The endgame is also tense because you can never be sure who will win since the lords are hidden. Someone might surprise everyone especially if they are the building lord. I quite like this game and glad I bought this over Stone Age. Recommend it to everyone as a great gateway game.

2015-04-18 - 8 - It's very good and I only played with two players so far. It's lighter worker placement than Tzolkin or Le Havre, but I really enjoyed it, because there is still a lot interesting choices. And the theme is quite existent here, which is another good thing. I expect that my rating may go higher after playing with more players.

2015-10-19 - 8->7.5 - The base game is pretty good but a little bit repetitive. I guess expansion might change it. Oh, and those obligatory missions are just lame.

2016-06-12 - 7.5->8 - I played with the expansion, which is really good, and I don't think I want to play without it. This game is a very solid light worker placement.

The usual Worker Placement but with a better theme, at least for someone who played RPG. The Intrigue Cards are unbalanced and can really damage someone, multiple times if people don't want you to win.

Good with all player counts (2-5), a great introduction to worker placement games, really smooth gameplay and pretty easy to teach. Plays relatively fast even with higher player counts. Even after playing many heavier worker placement games my group will still sometimes play Lords of Waterdeep + Skullport because the expansion definitely has kept it interesting.

I'm honestly fairly new to Euro games, so I haven't played a ton of them yet.  This one is a great simple worker placement game.  (The first one I ever played, in fact!)  I give this one very high marks because I am playing it quite a bit recently and find it easy to get on the table even with non-gamers.  I also dig the theme, since I am a big D&D fan.  I did immediately replace the cubes with DnDeeples, though.  I highly recommend doing so, as it tends to make people actually call them, "Clerics, Warriors, Mages, and Rogues." Otherwise, you hear people say, "Give me 3 white cubes, please."  I mean... it still works... but it isn't as thematic and fun.  :-)

RATING: 8
Wonderful box and insert. A really lovely way to decorate the sides and give a thematic feel. 

It plays fast and there is a nice balance of pretty standard Euro type elements to it. We enjoyed both games we played today and it certainly seems like it will get plenty more plays in the future. The intrigue cards are the only part i felt like we could use a but more variety in. Maybe an expansion with more cards and buildings might come along, if it doesn't I will still play it a fair number of times.

Pimped out with DnDeeples.

Update:  I actually really like this game and got to play a few more times, but as I won 100% of the games it is now very unpopular with my group.  More interactive than most WP games and plays quickly-- it's a keeper (maybe the expansion will attract players again).

I have played this a few times now, both with and without the skullport expansion. Each time feels more painful than the last. I hate, hate, hate the intrigue cards, which feel akin to the Chance cards in Monopoly. Other than that, fulfilling quest cards offer very little satisfaction to me. And since that's the crux of the game, when this gets brought out at game night it fills me with dread.

Theme is thinly pasted on but that doesn't matter. This is a straightforward worker placement game with a nice balance of simplicity, mild strategy, and luck. Plays in under an hour, and I find it works well with any number of players.

In my opinion it is a much better designed game than Agricola. The depth and options available remain about the same, but Lords of Waterdeep is less fiddly, easier to set up and play, has a clearer score system, and is much more fun overall.

How Agricola is rated so far above this game is beyond me.

Light worker placement game.  There are lots of choices, hidden VP objectives and opportunities to impact other players (or work around them).  Rating could go up with more plays.

Played this some more and the rating is increased to 9.  I'm starting to see how to put together an economic engine in this game, with plot quests and building combos that can really multiply your resources.  Other players have to decide whether to counter or maximize their actions, leading to a lot of tough decisions in the worker placement.

Solid euro, this is pretty much everything you want in a game. Lots of re playability, this (along with Dungeon Pets) are the perfect games to recommend to someone getting into the hobby. And yet complex enough that veteran gamers will enjoy it just as much as a casual gamer would.

And if you have this, you definitely want the expansion Scoundrels of Skullport. Once you play with it, you won't want to play without it. 

This is definitely not what one would expect from a game using the Dungeons and Dragons license, but its definitely a keeper.

RATING: 7
A fun and pretty good little worker placement game though resource collection is rather themeless as the colored cubes one collects tend to be referred to by their color (two purples, one orange, etc.) with little to no regard for what they represent (wizards, warriors, etc).  The random distribution of rolls before the start of the game means that you may get stuck with a roll that you can't work with given the quests that are available or become available.  In one game I played, it wasn't possible for me to wait around until quests were available that matched my roll,  I ended up completing many similar quests which were all the opposite of my characters qualities thus no bonus points were earned at the end of the game.  However, in other sessions, the quests went my way and I was able to gain many bonus points.  But I do enjoy the game and will willingly play it again.  The game plays quickly too provided you don't have a player who overanalyzes every move because he believes the world will end if he doesn't win the game (but that's not the fault of the game).  I think I prefer it with three than with four.  In summary, I'll willingly play this, perhaps even suggest it, but probably won't buy it simply because I have other games to play with themes I prefer (non fantasy).

A gorgeous worker-placement game with a very, very thin Dungeons and Dragons theme.  It's a top-notch production but at the end of the day it's a lot like Stone Age.  Unlike Stone Age, for some reason, players seem to get a bit more invested in achieving a win - maybe because of the thin theme of completing quests.  If you are familiar with the Forgotten Realms D&D setting and like worker placement, this is for you for sure.

This is just an initial rating, after one play late at night. LoW is a good Eurogame with a D&D theme that is practically irrelevant (unfortunately). It has a solid worker placement mechanic, though, and that's what drives the gameplay. It's easy enough that I suspect my eleven year-old could pick it up after a short explanation and a couple of practice turns, but that also limits its depth. There are a lot of choices in the game, but unfortunately there are too many of them that feel approximately equal in value. This reduces the tension significantly. The graphic design of the game is excellent. It's beautiful without being busy or distracting. All in all, LoW is a good medium/light worker placement game.

Nice worker placement game.  However, since it is a Dungeons & Dragons title, I expected it to be more thematic.  It is easy to forget that the cubes represent warriors, priests, thieves, etc.  People tend to just refer to them by their color, e.g. "I need 3 blacks, 2 oranges, and a white to earn 11 victory points."  But, I still thoroughly enjoy the game

One of my favorite games to pull out.  It is a fairly quick play and very easy to teach, but as someone that does not have much of an imagination I wish the cubes were replaced with something more thematic.

This game works well as a crossing point between people who loves the setting and those who love the resource management games. You can see the resources as colored cubes or as adventurers hired for the missions, it will not change the fun you will have playing it.

Often derided for being the Monopoly of serious board games. But there's a reason it's popular. Like Kingsburg this isn't much of a game with an outsize board and pasted-on theme. But like Kingsburg it's a favourite because it's smooth, fun, not thinky and never outstays its welcome. Also, it's a favourite to play with my son who beats me at it, which has got to be good.

Played this several times and enjoyed it when played, though of late when i'm in the mood there is now the steam port of the game and I tend to play that more.

It's a D&D themed worker placement game with quest cards for victory point scoring and some take-that cards as well.

You're drafting a party of adventurers (in the form of colored cubes) to complete quest goals and then gain points.

Honestly it would not be hard to peel the theme away and swap something else on top of it, but it is still a fun game.

This is the the new Stone Age for me.  This is a good entry level worker placement game with a ton of theme.

This game is one of my favorite worker-placement games, and I think it gets an unfair knock for having a weak theme.

Too easy with 2 players, but fairly fun with more.  I'll still play it on occasion as a simple worker placement but will likely be fully replaced with another game in the future.

Pure worker placement with a pasted on D&D theme. The game has plenty of opponent interaction with intrigue cards. I have not played with the mandatory quests, and not sure if I would as they detract from an otherwise rewarding experience. Collecting heroes for your cause and completing quests is something that any board gamer can relate with and is achieved with spectacularly with this offering. I suggest drafting, aka doubling up the potential choices, of Lords of Waterdeep and Quests at the beginning of the game to spice it up even more.

RATING: 8
I've been looking for a light and short action drafting/worker placement game for a very long time. This is it. While it's considerably random and far from deep, it also is highly accessible and fun.

Lords of the Waterdeep is a great game to lure tabletop RPG gamers into non-adventure board games. But, on the other hand, non-geeks can find the D&D theme completely uninteresting, not to mention it can be a wee bit to fiddly, mechanically speaking, due to all the different cards.

The game's biggest drawback is, by far and large, the luck factor. It has two main sources of luck, and both are card draws: the intrigue deck (action cards) and quest deck (objective cards). While intrigue draws aren't that crucial, quest draws will frequently give games away. A horrible curse in longer/deeper games, but perfectly acceptable in a game of its weight.

Long story short: a bit of a luckfest, but fun and fast to play. Great way to introduce tabletop RPGers into the hobby.

LoW is a thoroughly unoriginal game, I think I've seen every single mechanism somewhere before. However this doesn't matter much, as every aspect of the game is superbly polished from the easy-to-understand rules to the good looking and supremely functional bits. Another added bonus is that the game is very quick, even with five players it doesn't take more than a little bit over an hour. 

I'm not a fan of worker placement games and LoW is so straight-forward it's almost a filler, but even still I like the game.

04-08-2014 - I know I've played this more than once.  :-/  Good worker placement though a little basic.  I look forward to trying the expansion some time.  But when I look at my shelf considering what to spend my time on, I usually pick something else.  Not because it's bad, I usually just want more game.  Lords is like "you need orange cubes" and I'm like "ok" and I get some orange cubes.  I don't know, whatevs.  7 because it's not bad, just a little boring I guess.

Lords of Waterdeep has seen more plays in our household than any other. It can usually be had for around $30 and has a fantastic theme that will bring in rpgers without ruining its utility as a gateway Euro. Fantastic production values and lots of diversity with multiple lord cards, buildings, quests and intrigue cards. It's constantly in print and the expansion is one of the best there is. Z-man makes Stone Age and that's too bad because it's a solid game that's overpriced and out of print. Champions of Midgard is very cool, but the dice element can be a bit unforgiving randomly. Not that LoW is without its randomness, but I think it stands it's own. Plays fantastic at 2-3 if you have just the base game and equally well with 4-6 once you add the expansion.

RATING: 7.9
Rating is for the Ios implementation.

I've played it 4 times now. the tutorial is good. Interface is excellent.

when I mix the AI strengths the highest AI was never the hardest opponent. When the AI strength is the same the medium AI allready offers me a challenge.

the hidden roles, but certainly the quests and the buildings that come up make sure that every game will be different. 

Scoring is close and that probably is my main problem with the game. More so that there is kingmaking in giving mandatory quests near the end. Perhaps less interaction would be better. ( There is allready plenty of it in the worker placement itself) Infact I would have preferred a single bonus system there. (The AI plays controlled and doesn't differentiate between player and other AI ; he will set back who's in front and aid who's behind)
I find this system of catching up unneccesary and a spoiled gift in otherwise an excellent game.

I am fine with the buildings giving bonusses to their owners when used.  But on the cards well it either sets an opponent back or aids one other. This will mean I won't win many games as my local group considers me the person to beat. with a single bonus system , the best  worker placement would do the trick. 

However I think the gameplay is fun and think this is a solid middleweight workerplacement game that with a great theme.
 
I suspect my rating for the boardgame itself and given my group it would be a solid 7. A bit AP prone on one player given the many options and the little moves you can do.

This is a great worker placement game with enough complexity and variety to keep it interesting on repeated plays, and just enough chance to console you when you lose.  I like that there's a fair bit of player interaction in Lords of Waterdeep, and not too much of it is backstabbing.  This keeps each player focused on the game even when it's not his/her turn.  Rules are clearly spelled out in the well-written rulebook, and everything is easy to understand.  New players can jump into the game pretty easily without information overload before play begins.

RATING: 4
I think this game could have been conceived as a joke. Take the poster-child for boring-theme Euros - Caylus, and water its gameplay down, taking out the interesting interaction and adding in uninteresting take-that style interaction. Then, when you have the most banal lifeless cube pusher imaginable, you (very) thinly wrap a theme on it that appeals to the Euro haters, and they eat it up because they're all so starved to play a Euro game deep down. Excellent plan, really, if only because its showing all the Ameritrashers that Euros are actually fun to play, and hopefully some of them will take the training wheels off and move past this game.

Introductory level worker placement for Ameritrashers and D&D fans. Some Stone Age, a bit of Troyes, no dice, way too much luck-of-the-draw. Also has some serious balance issues, for example it's way easier to win with the "builder lady" than the other lords. Definitely needs some house rule there.

At least its easy to learn and the iconography is clear, one game and you've pretty much seen all there is to it. Two plays and it got dull. The take that -effects are repetitive, and despite the top notch production the theme doesn't really come through. I felt more like merely pushing cubes than recruiting adventurers to do my bidding. Seriously, what is it with the hype???

It's more euro than one would assume! Quite simple worker placement but still plenty of decisions to make.

This is a good game, a solid 8. Nothing new or especially profound but it's a lot of fun. Rating might have gone up a bit but the fact that I will probably only play 2-player games denies me the obviously different gaming experience you get when playing with three or more.

RATING: 3
I played this with six players and found it pretty worthless. There just aren't enough good choices to make it feel like anything but a waste of time. It had a problem that IME is almost unique in WP games, though is also in base Viticulture: too many workers, too few *useful* action spaces. I think a good WP game should have the opposite problem: so many good things you want to do and far too few workers to do them all. There are SO many WP games where you never get to do everything you want. Halfway through the first round of LoW I figured out there were no good options remaining and wanted to pass. 

I've played it twice, with both expansions and five and six players, and found it at best completely boring. Furthermore, with Santa's Workshop doing the "pile cubes on a card to win" mechanism as part of an excellent WP game, all of the mechanisms are done better in other games. So whatever it is you like about LoW, there's a better game out there with the same mechanism. Twice was one time too many, and having given it a second chance, I won't be playing it again.

A rating of 4 needs some explanation, but it won't be long. I basically did not enjoy playing the game, it lacked a certain something and there was more of a "take that" element than I like in a game, if someone decides they have it in for you you do not have a chance and good effort and tactics remain unrewarded, so for me it lacked balance.

A good time, would work better if the cubes were meeples.  Hard to attach the theme when people are asking for a white cube and a purple cube.  Intrigue cards can add some unwanted "gotcha" elements, so don't play with them if you want to avoid conflict and hurt feelings.  Plays well with two or four.  Box has good storage.

Box includes Scoundrels of Skullport, which is a must have expansion for this game.

Update: got meeples to upgrade cubes GenCon 2015.

My first affair with worker placement game, and a pleasant one. The decision tree is not really complicated. The game goes really smooth and quickly, lasts for like 1 hour for 3 players, and that's really important since if it would last just a little bit more than that it would definitely outstay its welcome. The Mandatory Quests can be nasty for 3+ players, definitely would remove them out. With 2 players they are fine.

Also own the Scoundrel of Skullport expansion. Gives some variety to the game, though not really a must-have if you ask me.

In Lords of Waterdeep, a strategy board game for 2-5 players, you take on the role of one of the masked Lords of Waterdeep, secret rulers of the city. Through your agents, you recruit adventurers to go on quests on your behalf, earning rewards and increasing your influence over the city. Expand the city by purchasing new buildings that open up new actions on the board, and hinder – or help – the other lords by playing Intrigue cards to enact your carefully laid plans.

During the course of play, you may gain points or resources through completing quests, constructing buildings, playing intrigue cards or having other players utilize the buildings you have constructed. At the end of 8 rounds of play, the player who has accrued the most points wins the game.

RATING: 10
This is an extremely well produced euro with a great deal of player interaction. A surprise coming from WOTC but hats of to a very enjoyable game from the Lord's perspective. Buildings that can be purchased dramatically alter the city in which you recruit adventurers and engage in intrigue. It seems abstract until you realize that you are a Lord above such "menial tasks" as the quests you use the adventurers to complete. Includes Scoundrels of Skullport expansion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
One of the very best gateway worker placement games, which can also be very enjoyable for seasoned board game players.

Don't let the theme fool you though, as this game is actually made for everyone (meaning: not only fantasy or Dungeons & Dragons fans), because the theme is actually pretty thin and disconnected from the actual mechanisms and rules.

The replay value is surprisingly high, thanks to the  different mission and action cards, the secret identities for each player (for bonus points) and many different buildings.

The components are great with love for detail, the artwork quality is great (with very few exceptions) and the rules are well-written and easy to understand.

I [b][i]highly[/i][/b] recommend the expansion [b][thing=134342][/thing][/b], which is essential for people playing this game regularly.

Somebody thought sticking a D&D theme on a worker placement game and then giving it a whole lot of randomness via quest cards would improve things?  Looks like they know something about human nature (given the games' enormous popularity)  that I haven't figured out yet.  Not for me.

RATING: 7.4
The basic mechanism is just another simplified Caylus-like resource conversion worker placement Euro; nothing special.

Then some American style fun is added:
- theme, graphic design, flavor texts
- "characters" = secret aims
- Intrigue = some "take that" effect and screw your opponent randomness and/or leader bashing

They still don't make the game great fun, but it's fun enough. It's actually strange to see it's so much a resource conversion euro that it even uses cubes for characters like Wizards, Thiefs, Warriors and Priests.

Several games, 5p.  Better than I expected, given the theme.  After hearing the rules, I realized that the theme was an after thought.  This is very much like Caylus, but without the Provost/Baliff, and buildings work immediately (i.e. no specific order that actions are taken in).  There was some player interaction, but it was mostly random.  For example, there is a series of cards that removes one cube of a specific color from all opponents stockpiles, and, for every opponent that doesn't have any, the player of the card gets some other bonus.  This will hit some players more than others, and the player of the card has little control over it (they have some, in that they can choose when to play the card to maximize the effect they wish).  I did not like THOSE cards.  There were others that targeted a specific opponent, some of which were good, others bad.  This was less random, at least, and much less onerous.  But, overall, this was a pretty good game, and should play fairly quickly I should think (with the right players).  But the theme is TOTALLY unnecessary.  I never felt, not once, that I was assembling a group of adventurers using various buildings to complete quests.  I was simply collecting cubes to fulfill victory point conditions.

Another worker placement game, with a D&D setting. The gameplay is quite straightforward and i would have liked more players interaction, but it's not bad at all.

Nice pure worker placement game with some randomness, some "take that" and an inconsequential & tacked-on D&D theme.  Buildings create new placement spots with reward for the owner a la Caylus, but the whole thing is very light.  Length is ok but simply too long with the expansion.  Depth & some complexity are there but are really mitigated by random events and general play happenstance.  It's a nice way to spend an hours (or 2, with 5 players).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In general it's a good game. Some might say that it's much more easier than Caylus or stone age. Personally I think it runs well and I find caylus simply broken.

My first complain is that I would have liked to build more buildings like in Caylus. I liked the idea of making buildings that other players can use. It's just that in LOW, you can build at most (in theory) 8 buildings through the game since the builder roles is can only be limited to once per round. It does not make it a bad game, it's just not what I expected.

The second thing I did not like is the non standard flow of resources. For example, all buildings requires gold to build. But quest can require anything to fulfill them , it can take characters, but it can also take gold. And so are the rewards diversified, it can be anything from gold to Victory points to even additional characters.

I think they should have standardized the resources flow. It OK that quest require different types of characters, but it should always require characters. Maybe quest rewards should have always been victory point, gold or a combination of both.

Now the resource flow is very chaotic and resources gets converted in many directions by quest, intrigues and worker placement. It does not break the game, it just makes it very chaotic to manage.

Some people complained about the randomness in the game (random quest, buildings, intrigue, etc). Personally, I don't mind much because it offers a lot of replay value. It's true that I did not get a chance to get many quest card that matched my lord's power so I could blame the luck for that. I managed to match 2 cards while another player managed to match 7.

I would have loved that each house had a special power, or that each player draw an intrigue card at the beginning of the round. I did not have a chance to draw many intrigue cards, more choice would have given me a reason to use them.

As worker placement games go, Lords of Waterdeep is more enjoyable for me than Caylus and usually provides more options for me.  It's simpler in that you just manage resources and use intrigue cards to fulfill Quests.  The biggest difference for me on why I prefer Waterdeep much more is that I do NOT have to calculate all the SEQUENCES, TURN ORDER and TIMING permutations that Caylus requires.  I can just manage my own resources, cards and aim for Quests.  This streamlines things and makes for a fun, quicker and enjoyable game with a great fantasy (D&D) theme.  Caylus is more analytically skillful, and so is Russian Railroads.

RATING: 5
I enjoyed this one despite being pretty much a basic worker placement game.  The variance and mystery of the intrigue cards and the starting characters helps give replay value to the game as well as the variance in what buildings may get built each game.  Highly recommend constructing useful buildings as they will generate healthy rent rewards, particularly if built early in the game.  The aspect where you go to the harbor and play and intrigue card and then later get to place those workers again to take another (obviously lesser) action is another excellent mechanic that adds to the flavor of the game.  This definitely is a eurogame with a bit of Ameritrash flavor/theme.  

After my second play, I don't feel much of a need to play again.  I will do so if asked, but won't seek it out.  This is a very basic worker placement game and I would prefer Agricola or other more interesting worker placement games.

I tend to shy away from anything when the WP is mentioned in the games descreption, but LoW had me intrigured. it was described as a nasty, thematic, worker placement game. I like nasty and thematic so I was looking forward to giving it a try at least. I must say that the game lives up to its reputation. It can be quite nasty, and it is pretty thematic for a worker placement game taking place in a high fantasy town placed within the D&D world. The components are pretty nice, and the graphic design is done quite well. The lay out of the board makes for a pretty intuitive gaming experience. The gameplace is one of the biggest selling points, and is easily understood in 10-15 minutes of rules explanation. I had an enjoyable time when playing the game, although I did find that many of the objectives from what I think were the expansions to be quite overpowered compared to the base game objectives. And you win the game through completing these objectives. But of course this is a worker placement game so I could take it, or leave it. If unlike me you are a worker placement game fan you definitely should give this one a shot. Its straightforward and plays quickly and adds some teeth to a genre that tends to be passive aggresive at best.

Hands down the best gateway game in the most-prestigeous worker placement category, with the caveat that the game really shines with the two expansions. Similar to Splendor, I think this game has really brought a lot of people and families back into the boardgaming industry, at a time the industry and community was hurting. It's difficult to make a euro game not feel intimidating to new gamers and families, with mechanics that are simple enough for kids to understand and enjoy, while still holding the interest of more experienced gamers... yet LoW accomplishes it all. And has not been surpassed since it released in 2012!

Playdek is going to release an app! A must have. Bought on 23 Nov, 2013. It proves that a Euroish worker tile placement game can be right on spot with a pointed theme, which can be great fun!

Each player is an adventurer with his/ her own agenda. Some will score more with certain types of adventure (e.g. commerce, piety, warfare, arcana, skullduggery, etc.), some will score for each building under control. Thus, Lords of Waterdeep is a Euroish minimax game - maximizing the resources cube you can get and the adventures require and minimizing the resources available to your opponents. Actually I quite like this game although normally this is not the kind of game I like. It is because the theme, Forgotten Realms of the Dragonlance saga, is well applied to the system, the cards, the adventures and the objective of the game. Although the objective is to win the game by gaining the most victory points, there is a lot of paths out there to achieve that. Taken together, the cards of intrigues, agents, adventures, resources, weave out a web of a believable Dragonlance universe, living up to what the novel flexes out. The card art is some of the better fantasy paintings I have seen in recent years, while retaining much of the D&D flavor.

Competent, vanilla, above average, par-for-the-course. The expansion adds some interest, raising the score. Not a bad game, quite the opposite, but its so bland, we've seen everything in this one before. Good for a gateway experience because new gamers wont have these expectations. If this game is your training wheels, I encourage you to look into other worker placement games. It's a truly lovely genre!

A worker placement game which is not bad, but not great either. It does have two differences when compared to the other worker placement games I own (Stone Age and Leonardo da Vinci): you can build things that can be used as new places for workers and, when used, give something to those who built them ; Few rounds and few workers force really careful decisions. I haven't played it enough times in order to see how much the "lady builder" makes the game unbalanced, so I can't comment on that.

Ca ne se voit pas au premier regard, mais Lord of waterdeep est bel et bien un jeu de gestion de ressources avec placement d'ouvriers.

Il tourne comme une horloge.
Règles expliquées en 7 minutes chrono. 
Durée de la partie environ 1H30
Un jeu qui peut séduire les novices (s'ils lisent l'anglais) et les joueurs les plus chevronnés.

Je le préfère à 2 car moins chaotique.
Seul bémol : les mandatory quest.
Elles handicapent réellement et à 3 ou 4 joueurs il faut bien la donner à celui qui est en passe de gagner et ce n'est pas toujours le cas car on a tendance à se fier à la position sur la piste de score sans faire assez attention aux ressources en reserve et aux quêtes en passe d'être réalisées.
A deux ce problème ne se pose pas : la mandatory quest c'est pour l'adversaire ! Gnark !

Having only played on the iPhone, it's perhaps unfair to say that the theme doesn't really shine through, but as a lighter worker placement game, I do enjoy how the quests more obviously build on one another compared to (IMO) the apex worker placement game of Caylus, where I can understand the complaints that it's a little dry.

This was my [url=http://www.daveexmachina.com/wordpress/?p=7257]Game of the Year[/url] for 2012. Lords of Waterdeep doesn’t do anything new, but it does all the old familiar things so damn well. It’s an absolute breeze to learn and play, and it’s a rare game with absolutely no excess baggage. Every portion of the game contributes, and in a meaningful, intuitive way. It plays great with two people or with five. It has [url=http://www.daveexmachina.com/wordpress/?p=5935]the best quest[/url]. There are other games on this list that are better games, but there’s a reason Lords of Waterdeep got more plays than anything else this year.

Great worker placement game.
I like that you always have a clear goal to work towards to, and because you'll complete 5+ missions every game, you can't really make a bad action that you'll regret the whole game (looking at you Giants).
Our group likes the theme because we play D&D, but it's a bit pasted on.
Only issue is that the Mandatory Quests are too strong and can significantly influence the outcome, and if you get bad starting quests, you'll have to play exceptionally well to win.

RATING: 7
The biggest pro is that this game looks amazing.  The map and the lord cards are very thematic, interesting, and it feels very lore-ish like LOTR.  I don't think you'll beat the look and feel of the game for this price point.

Essentially it is a worker-placement game about gaining control of a city.  You are a lord who is trying to complete quests by using adventures of different types to complete them.

Overall I do really enjoy this game.  I used to think that the intrigue cards were a glaring design flaw (because they are so weak), but that was before I knew about the rule that you get to reassign your worker afterwards!  Completely changes that.  That makes intrigue WORK, but they still feel kind of pidly, like you're just trying to meddle, but don't do that much damage.  Although they can really hurt your opponents if played at the opportune time.  So they're ok.

The other thing I don't like is the idea that your lord is a secret; no one will know till the end of the game!  Well the fact is that they all (except one) operate the same: they give bonus points to some category of quest.  So you quickly figure out which quests your opponents are gunning for and there really is no mystery to it.  They should either have had more interesting lords.  Or just removed the idea of having it be a mystery for other players to figure out.

Also, I feel like the depth of this game is much less than what others claim.  Still a GOOD GAME for sure, but it really shouldn't be ranked #28 on bgg.

Despite 25 plays, I flip flop on the rating of this game more than any other. On one hand, I feel like this instead of Settlers should be THE gateway game, and this game is one of the nongamer's favorite amongst my collection. Plus, besides the cubes, the components are very high, and while you are basically playing a cube management game, the "quests" and what not add a nice touch. On the other hand, this game gives a vibe of lacking depth (although I heard that the expansion fixes this). I feel like this game is most balanced with 3-4 players, but have the most fun with 2 because you can chain quests one after another.

EDIT: By lacking depth I mean at the time of writing I have an 85% win rate at this game, yet never really feel like I plan my turns super strategically, instead just following some basic principles and taking whatever spot I am needing of resources of at the time of my turn.

Despite the horrible box cover art, and the deeply nerdy DnD theme, this is a very accessible worker-placement game.  A crowd-pleaser.  I would go as far as to even say it could be a gateway game.  

Setup is a little fiddly, but not too bad once you get it organized.  Great components, lots of fun.

Expansions add even more depth and decisions, without over-complicating the rules.

Eventually replaced for me by Yedo, a game with similar ideas, but more depth without adding too much more playtime.  Also prefer Yedo's ninja/samurai theme to DND.

I enjoy this game a lot, though it's rating has steadily slipped over the past several years. I think I've just reached the point that I prefer meatier worker placements or ones with a more immersive theme, so this almost never makes it to the table. I do enjoy playing it on my iPad though. Especially with Scoundrels of Skullport. There are few games (even many of Feld's) that manage the "hurt yourself to make yourself stronger" mechanism as well as the corruption track.

The base game is nice but the worker placement aspect in the end will spoil a bit the atmosphere (you're not dungeon crawling, in the end).

This game is a wonder.  It distills the worker placement game to its bare bones, then ties it remarkably to its Forgotten Realms theme.  It's a little bizarre how well that works.  I doubt that it will pass up Dominant Species for me in the worker placement category, but when combined with the D&D Adventure series, I am convinced that Wizard of the Coast is serious about making thematic board games.

RATING: 7.5
Type: 2-5 player worker placement

Best with: 4-5 players
Weight: Medium
Duration: 1-3 hours, gets long with 5
Notes:
Straight-up worker placement based on quest cards
Very little interaction or screw-your-neighbor beyond a few mandatory quests and blocking worker placement

Worker placement game with an old school D&D theme on top of it. Good for 2-5 players and it scales well across them all. The 2 player game is a bit more strategic and the 5 player one a bit more tactical as you have far fewer agents to place and collect resources.

Components are excellent. Many praise the box insert, but I find it to leave my cards and tokes a disaster if stored or transported upright at all. The game should have come with more flavorful classes instead of wooden cubes; a very large missed opportunity. Picking up themed wooden pieces that better illustrate the classes of the cubes is a must-buy if you intend to keep this game. The cards are a nice quality with that professional linen feel to their faces. Honestly, the components are fine and the board itself lays nicely flat. Setup is relatively easy (after retrieving the mess that the interior of the insert becomes) as is teardown after.

One upside is how approachable this game is; there may be no better gateway game to boardgames and pseudo-euro style games. The rules are simple, the rewards obvious, the interaction amongst players somewhat muted and brisk, and the scores are in flux until the last player's victory points are tallied at the end. And yet there can be some strategy involved once you get the hang of it, from blocking your opponents to attempting to string together a quest whose rewards feed the next quest requirements.

One downside is the fact this is a silky smooth, straight-forward worker placement game (aka cube-pusher) and can be extremely boring if you don't bring the theme of the game to life. Make some D&D jokes; absorb the old school flavor of the quests; make mini-stories about your tavern and your agents and the warriors and clerics they're gathering and sending off to the doom or glory. Without the added fun of the theme being taken for a ride by the players, this game can be a serious drag late in a gaming session or just ho-hum early on.

A second downside in a two-player game is how direct and confrontational the Mandatory Quests can be. When you're in a 3+ player game, there is some fun to be had with blocking someone. But in a 2 player game, you have no choice but to give the other player a roadblock they have to deal with, while it gives you no benefit in return. Some people aren't going to like that, but I suppose you could just take those Intrigue cards out, as they're not all that common to draw anyway. While on the topic, the Lieutenant and Ambassador can be taken out for 2 players as well. Scored early on, they can easily unbalance the game.

This game is excellent, but does suffer slightly from being pretty light on theme, light on depth, and can be a drag when the players aren't into the theme and just go through the motions of the mechanics. But otherwise, great game.

Similar games in my collection: Dungeon Petz (worker placement), Province (worker placement), Viticulture (worker placement), Carcassonne (worker placement)

Right now (spring/summer 2012), I see this game everywhere.  I suppose I see the appeal for folks who really want a blend of Euro and D&D.  But to me, those are two great tastes that taste weird together.  Not enough role-playing for narrative for my storytelling side, and not interesting enough choices for my euro side.  I think I'd rather play an RPG version of Agricola.

This is a light worker placement game that is very family friendly.  The game has elements of other worker placement games like resource collection, resource management, etc.  But it seems to do it in a very interesting way.  You have a secret goal that gives you points at the end of the game, and you complete quests to score points.  Waterdeep Harbor is great as it provides some opportunities for "take that" like mandatory quests, but are not game breaking for other players.  It also gives you additional moves.  

I like the game a lot and so does my family.

Played with 2 players.
We liked it. Think it would be better with more in that there would be less pieces to choose from. 
Now p[layed with 3 & 4 and it is better that way because people get in each others way.

Playing intrigue is important, like the way you get a pick at the end after playing it.

I think the theme is good but you have to work hard to make it work.

D&D does worker placement. The quests offer interesting flavor including some of the rewards for completing them. The secret role you are given at game start has a big impact on what you strategy may be.

Played twice.

Ugh.  Take the theme from D&D, use it for flavor text, and then add some bland worker placement with a bit of placement growth, and you get this game.  Play is rather automatic, uninspired, and frankly, boring.  I can see the appeal of this as a gateway game, as the mechanics are so painfully obvious and easy to grasp, but beyond that, I can't figure out why it is apparently so popular.  So many worker placement games hide their mechanics better (including some lovely gateway-style titles), and provide more options for both victory points and turn-to-turn choice.

Not interested in playing again.  Definitely never re-acquiring this.

I love the D&D theme.  The mechanics work great.  The pieces, cards, and board are beautiful and very high quality.  Played a couple times and really enjoyed it both times.  Can't wait to get this on the table again.

UPDATE:  Adding the expansion to this game breathes so much new life into it.  I always enjoyed the game but could see it getting stale after repeated plays.  The modules add a lot to the game including an extra player.  The interaction between players is ramped up as well as the new quests and Lords.   A great game has just been made better.  This ain't leaving my collection any time soon.

Was very skeptical how this game would play and pretty much ignored much of the lead-up as I was not interested in a D&D tacked on theme, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Was really expecting a dull game where WoTC was cashing in on the license and hoping they could sell enough copies from that alone.  

I quite like Agricola, but it is lengthy and definitely does not appeal to all those I usually play with.  I think that Lords of Waterdeep could fit the bill for what I/m looking for on a more regular basis.  Just can't help but wonder how this game would play with a different theme attached to it.

Rating after 3 games, all of which have been enjoyable and pretty close right up to the finish. For its weight, which is reasonably light compared with some worker placement games, it always seems appealing, even though it could do with a few enhancements thematically. The cubes representing the adventurers are slightly jarring in this respect, and if they were replaced with something better resembling said adventurers we might stop referring to them as mere 'cubes'.

While the D&D theme is done well, this is in every other way a run-of-the-mill worker placement game. I can't point to any particular mechanic and say "that's unique". The game borrows heavily from a range of games, and it does manage to work quite well, but somehow I find the whole package uninspiring. It's certainly not a bad game, in fact it's a reasonably good game, but I don't find it to be particularly memorable, and that seems to impact on how often I want to play it.

Play cards to help you and hinder your opponents - NEVER grow tired of playing this have clocked up 900 plays on my phone

Another worker placement game with a D&D theme pasted on. After a few plays the D&D charm wears off and it boils down to placing workers and resource collection.

In the interest of disclosure, I must say I've been an avid Dungeon and Dragons fan for almost 15 years. That being said, I like this game. It a well made worker placement with just enough additional mechanics to add longevity and variety. The set up is quick and the mechanics are stream lined enough that you can bring pretty much anyone with basic board game understanding into a game in about 15 minutes. The games goes pretty fast after round or two, as people get the hang of it, and is pretty fast paced with experienced players. While it's certainly not the most strategy heavy game I've ever played, the game offers engaging choices and plenty of occasions to pull the breaks on your opponents.  

All in all, a solid pick.

Early opinions based on one play. 

Very good game. Plenty of good decision making, but not a brain burner by any stretch. Casual gamers could play this with minimal rules explanation; it just feels well-designed and intuitive. Illustrations on the gameboard and building tiles let you see at a glance what those spaces do. Some nice player interaction via Intrigue cards (for example, some make your opponents discard their resources). 

Really fun game. Our four player game, in which no one had played before, still took only an hour and a
half. I'm looking forward to taking this for another spin.

A wonderful introduction to worker placement.  Gameplay is light and it doesn't overstay its welcome. Easy to teach. Great components and storage for said components!  The theme is pasted on but it doesn't detract from the gameplay.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
No question, this is a beautiful game, and they managed to make the components functional, too. The coinage, for example, faithfully reflects the background world, and there is a good thematic tie of most quests to what you have to do to succeed in-game. In spite of this, and in spite of the very enjoyable first game, I’m not sure about the longevity here.

Apart from the background, there is not so much happening here that would differentiate Lords of Waterdeep from a wealth of other worker placement games. What is new is well implemented, however, and makes me hope that this could keep its allure for longer: the buildings introduce interesting ways to shift the value of the adventurers around, and I love how the Harbor both limits the impact of Action Cards by making them harder to play and introduces interesting timing decisions.

After a single game, I’m definitely not sure whither the pendulum might swing with this one, so for now it gets a lukewarm rating of 7.

Update: A couple of more games have shown this to keep its promise, so the rating is raised to an 8.

Straightforward worker placement with no theme. The engine building aspect of buying and adding buildings to the board breaks up the gameplay a bit, but otherwise it's pretty monotonous.

RATING: 7
Ok, definitely not a bad game.  However if you're into the Euro mechanics in the game, the "take that" cards may not feel like they belong, like they did with me.  If you've played Stone Age, think of that, but where people play cards that make you lose a gold if you have one.  For me it just felt like people shouldn't mess with "MY" stuff.  But that's what you get when you take Euro mechanics and add a bit of Ameritrash flavor I suppose.  I like the Le Havre-like building ownership stuff going on.

It's a really simple game to learn, and I can really appreciate the melding of a theme such as Dungeons and Dragons with a modern worker placement Euro.  I'm glad it exists and glad people like it.  Just not sure I care for the "take that" stuff when I'm "pushing cubes" :)  Not for me, but I'm happy it's liked by others.

Meh - original comment with my 5 rating after 1 play.

NEVER AGAIN - new comment after changing rating to 3 after second play.

For background, I do not like "working placement" (action drafting) games in general.  The constraints on resource/action selection just seems to serve the purpose of disrupting any real long term planning.  Lords of Waterdeep has that in spades.

I also do not like "take that" games that last very long at all.  A really short and simple "take that" is fine, but the longer it goes on, the more uninteresting it is to me.  

So, my second play of Lords of Waterdeep lasted for 5 hours.  I am fine with long games, but I would rather have played Roads and Boats, which can often be done in less time. 

This game mixes design elements I do not enjoy to create an experience that I do not enjoy and that can, in some cases, be stretched over far to long a time.  NEVER AGAIN.

This was the first game my wife asked me to play even when I didn't suggest a game night. So it'll always have a place in my collection because of that. It's a great gateway, and it has a bit of depth as well. I personally love the theme, but I can see why it's generally derided.

Very very unbalanced. The lords are unbalanced, the quests are unbalanced, hell, even the buildings are unbalanced (especially the one with the two ? cubes where the owner gets 1 ? cube). It's fun even though it is unbalanced. I hope the expansion fixes all (doubt it).

Essentially a worker placement and resource management game. This ticks all my boxes as a Project Manager. The fact that is has a D&D Forgotten Realms theme is just a bonus. One of the most unique and satisfying game mechanics I have ever seen in a board game. And the expansion, the Scoundrels of Skullport, is one of the few game expansions out there that actually adds more to the core game and, dare I say it, is probably a must-have. It has seen several successive plays at my gaming group and it always gets a favourable nod when recommended.

RATING: 4
It's everything I hate about worker placement games into one tight package.

Obvious choices, hidden goals that force you to do the same thing the entire game, "inconvenient blocking", and no player interaction.

The gist of the game is this: You get a "Lord" card that dictates your entire game.  It might be something like a bonus for a certain type of quest or a bonus for each building you have.  I enjoy games that force me not to make interesting decisions or doesn't allow me to discover the game's system on my own.

Afterwards, you're given workers to that you place one time at a time to collect different colored cubes.  Why are you collecting these cubes?  Because your quests need specific colored cubes.  What happens when you are done with a quest?  You get another one, so you can get another set of colored cubes.  Do this against for 8 rounds and two hours

That's literally the entire game.  Sure, there are Intrigue cards that players can play to hinder another player or help themselves, otherwise it's a game about collecting sets of cubes for the sake of collecting sets of cubes.  There is no engine building, no strategy to conjure, or anything interesting going on.

If you want a worker placement game with a bit more meat but still easy to teach, get Viticulture Essential Edition instead.

This is a superb game. It's rare that my whole group enjoys a new game with equal enthusiasm, and that coupled with how well this Euro expresses its theme and how tight the final scores were tells me that this has a long future with us.

I love that as lords steeped in intrigue, going to the docks and playing Intrigue cards is almost always a good choice; it feels right and it fits. I love that in a D&D game, the main way the lords get things done is by assembling groups of adventurers to do them -- and that quests almost always come from a tavern.

Excluding the box, with its awful (though pretty) half-lid and uselessly fiddly insert (which surprised me after the amazing one in Conquest of Nerath), the components are fantastic. LoW looks great, plays great, and is a blast from start to finish.

It's the complete package and a total home run.

RATING: 9
Exceptional game. Probably more similar to Caylus than any other game I've played. Though, this one is not as dry as Caylus. The quests/secret roles are what really make this game shine. Lords of Waterdeep is really a gateway game, IMO. It's incredibly streamlined and simple to play. Of course, understanding the importance of plot quests and being cognizant of critical timing with intrigue cards are pivotal to success, and these might be difficult for a new gamer to wrap their head around. I was skeptical of this game for the first year it was out, particularly the D&D theme (which is rather pasted on, incidentally). But after playing it, I love it. 

Update 3/2014: Such a great game! I have more invested (in terns of money) in it than any other game in my collection. Part of the reason for such a high rating is the fact that everyone I have played with enjoys this game. It's super smooth, intuitive, fun, accommodates up to 6 players with the expansion (and plays well at every number) and can be played in less than 90 minutes. I can't really say anything bad about this game.

Theme is a turnoff for me and my wife, but that's personal preference.  Love the resource collection missions, though the theme of the cubes being people is questionable and pasted on at best.

RATING: 7.97
Initial reading of the rules made me think there wasn't much there. Five games in and in a way there isn't and yet it exceeds. It absolutely works as a gateway. If you want the blue pill to go deeper, look elsewhere. This is a fundamental worker placement game that adds Intrigue cards for some basic flavoring. I think the best words to describe how I feel about it is that it simply overachieves.

For all of the hate this game gets, I keep going out and playing other worker placement games and end up preferring this one in the end. Yes, there are ultimately better WP games, but those games are already higher ranked games so they should be better. As a gateway? This works.

I have no real central strategy for this game. I try to "play between the lines" as much as possible, but for whatever reason, I have won this game at a 60% rate. One of my losses was by a point.

3+ players works best. I found the 2-player game lacked proper tension that I seek although many claim to have no issues with two player games.

This still feels like 85% of a game. Houses are token placeholders for colors and thus add nothing. The diversity with the lords is essentially non-existent. You have lords who give bonuses for two different types of quest, or "The House Lord." That's it.

Update: Gets more play compared to other games than I would like but has worked extremely well with other players. This is thee gateway WP game at this point. 

Rating potential: between 7-8. If the eventual expansion was added in from the start, 9-10. Currently hanging around #10 for me. I think the rating for the base game might go lower, but it will end up being such a staple in my collection it will easily beat out higher rated games in terms of plays. This one is difficult to really nail down in terms of a score. Like I said, it simply overachieves.

Update: Lowered score mostly due to finding the little things that bug. Still a very solid game and may still be  around my Top 20 for a long time. The fact that it hits with so many players makes it hard to really lower it too much. 

Update II: I might lower it a touch more(7.88), but I feel like I'm nitpicking it at this point since I have played it so much for me at least. There are a couple other gateway type WP games I am interested in, and if I ever get to play those, I might be able to better hammer out a score for LoW. Since those games have a lower rating/rank, I'm not sure LoW will go down much.

I think this game would make a perfect transition game after your standard gateway euro games. It seems to be a watered down version of Caylus with more theme. Has more depth than a Carcassonne or Dominion but plays in under an hour so not too much to scare away newcomers. 

I'm kinda on the fence about how I feel about this one. I feel like it leaves me wanting a bit more. It's a little too light to scratch that itch, but a little too complex to be that "quick filler." I do enjoy playing it, is just usually rather play something else.

Bought at Kingslayer Comics.

Very solid game.  Too light for current tastes.  Great for an introductory worker placement though.  Theme is a bit lacking, as you're really just pushing cubes.

I'm hoping that the expansion + DnDeeples will help this.

---
Update 1/18/16.  Played with expansion at Board of Games Tustin.  3 Players.  Corruption mechanic really added a new layer of depth to the game.  DnDeeples also really added a nice splash of theme, but not so much as I was really hoping (people still called them orange, black, etc.). I didn't shuffle the buildings correctly, so we started with all of the corruption removing buildings, meaning nobody had any corruption by game-end.  

Hoping next play will be more tight on the corruption.

See Scoundrels of Skullport for new rating WITH expansion.

Lords of Waterdeep is a worker placement game that takes players behind the scenes of the action of Dungeons and Dragons, to the scheming and plotting that takes place before the adventurers go on their quests.

In it players are secret rulers in the city of Waterdeep.  They gather together the fighters, rogues, wizards, and clerics required to accomplish the type of quests that would be played out in a session of Dungeons and Dragons.  Quests are worth points and, of course, whomever gets the most points wins.  Other actions that can be taken are to build new buildings in the city, which will benefit you when other players use them, or play intrigue cards.

Lords of Waterdeep is a fun, entry-level, worker placement game.  In my opinion it dethrones Stone Age as being the introductory worker placement game with some meat on its bones.  If you like the fantasy theme, then this is certainly one you should try.

I'd prefer sci-fi theme since I've kind of outgrown D&D. It's generic enough to be enjoyable no matter what your taste is though. Ironically it's American game with cubes as components, really, it's a cube pusher. Very smooth next generation cube pusher though, the cards are great idea. Doesn't take long to explore all the options though.
 *update: expansion helps a lot, rating 6->8

My review:  http://manualgamer.com/lords-of-waterdeep-review/

Short Version:  A great worker placement game, set around recruiting adventurers, completing quests and scoring points for plotting and scheming in the DnD city of Waterdeep.  

Each player has a hidden identity which is revealed at the end of the game, which will give bonus points depending on the objectives completed (mainly completing particular quest types).  This means that one can never be quite sure who is in the lead.  

Lords of Waterdeep is very well polished, with excellent pacing.  It never outstays its welcome and is an excellent use of game-time.

It has a low learning curve and is accessible to non-gamers, but with enough depth and variety to keep experienced gamers interested.

Combine this with plenty of interaction between players,  and a pretty theme  and we have a game that is a real real winner.

Nem rossz, de nem is a top. Valamiért nem fogott meg annyira, mint a Caylus vagy a Stone Age, pedig ez elvileg tematikusabb, amiből én nem sokat éreztem. Talán ha nem kockák, hanem apró emberkék lennének benne, akkor hangulatosabb lenne, bár alapvetően a játékmenet is kevésbé interaktív, mint az említett játékokban. Az eddigiek alapján simán lehet úgy nyerni, ha az ember nem figyeli a többieket, hanem csak a saját céljait próbálja teljesíteni, ami nálam hátrányt jelent egy játéknál.

One of the more accessible euro style games around. Short play time but still has some interesting decisions. A bit light on theme for my taste.

Update: score lowered considerably. After a few more plays since my initial impression, a lot of the shine has worn off. Too much randomness and a take that mechanic that is just too punishing and too easily applied to the wrong player since its impossible to know who the leader is. Also, getting the building Lord is just too much of an advantage.

RATING: 9
All of the praise for this game is well deserved. 

Good: 
A good variety of planning and scheming is required to get your meeples placed in the location you are hoping for in order to succeed in your lord's objectives (complete quests, build, etc). 

While you can interfere with your opponent's plans by blocking spaces they want or using intrigue cards against them, the game never really feels overly cutthroat. 

The game has a built in insert that holds all of the components perfectly.

Bad: 
The components don't really enhance the theme. For example, adventures are represented by cubes but in the end they only feel like resources, they may as well be food cubes needed to complete quests. If you enjoy this game I would recommend looking into replacing the cubes with character meeples.

RATING: 7
Fun, yes. Overhyped? Perhaps. To me it plays like Stone Age with the building mechanics of Caylus. And as such, I like it because it’s deeper than SA and not as long as Caylus. 

The theme fell completely flat for me though. They’re cubes, not warriors, clerics, what-have-you. I’m fine with that but it does seem strange. 

The Lord cards serve as variable end game bonus, but are fairly minor and can be annoying. The building one is the only one of interest. 

Some reviewers have pointed out the Mandatory Quest problem. This is really the only true conflict and it can be huge. House rules can adjust this if desired. 

The building variability allows for replays but all the other randomness really isn’t random at all and so I think this will suffer the same fate as SA after enough plays. But still, it’s fun now.

Was very dubious about this but Merran and Terry said it was excellent and that's usually enough of a review for me. And it was only going to take about an hour (although Trif said that about Circus Train and see how that turned out ...)
This was SO MUCH FUN! I even taught it the next day too. D&D-theming meets Caylus-style worker placement. VERY Caylus-style, actually. But both of those things work well for me.
Want to buy.

I am not a big fan of Eurogames or Workerplacement in special, but this game is very light. It makes fun to place your agents, thinking of all the quests you are planning. It works great with the suspension growing between the players constantly eyeing at each other, trying to guess wich Lord the other player is.

Perfectly pleasant game but not a tight worker placement experience with 2p--better with more players, no scaling mechanism to make it tighter at lower player counts.  Good enough to play and keep around but nothing that particularly grabs me.  Component quality is slightly disappointing with a warped board and thin cards.

Broken game. Every time I've played the builder won by a landslide. Yes if everyone teams up against them they might be able to stop her but that's just bad design... Oh yes and the d&d theme is paper thin. I never feel like there is anything meaningful or exciting going on in the game... Just bidding or cubes.

12/18/12 Played 60% of a five-player game.
I had no idea what the theme was supposed to be, or what a "waterdeep" is, or what we player's were supposed to be. The four colors of resource cubes were supposed to represent... something, but it was never stated what. Its as if one took about three Euros, used one random mechanism from each, then pasted on an ill-fitting fantasy theme. Unfortunately the designers used a very boring and laborious set of mechanisms to borrow. I assume the real audience for this game are those that are familiar with the theme; which isn't me. As best as I can figure the *only* reason to play this game is if one likes the theme. Baring that its merely a boring exercise in cube gathering and blocking the placement of other player's meeples. As I have no idea what the theme is (nor do I care to find out) it left me cold. I hope to never see it again. 
 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
I like the replay-ability. There is lots of variety so each game is different. My family loves it! It is the Intrigue aspect of Waterdeep Harbor that brings my score down. There is nothing worse than getting a late-game attack (mandatory quest) to ruin an otherwise enjoyable experience! I will play it when it comes out but I like other worker placement games much more. I will try this with the expansion to see if that improves the overall experience.

One of the very few fantasy-themed games I own. Generally, I am turned off by orcs, dwarves, dragons and beautifully detailed Elven languages. The fact that I like this is testament to its quality as a game. Plus the fact that I can't remember that the cubes represent various clerics and stuff, but are just cubes - thankfully, the theme doesn't intrude as far as referring to the cubes as mages, clerics and knights. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Neat. Takes away the tedium of optimization of classic worker placement games by adding quests and player interaction in the form of intrigue cards, yet it remains deep enough to make players happily stare at the board for a long time with silently moving lips. Splashed with a thin layer of fantasy theme it makes easy to sell to the family, especially with a few fantasy miniatures on hand. Easy and thoroughly enjoyable game, for the whole family.

Have had the best results recruiting new gamers with this game.  Most of my newbies could care less about the theme, but I think secretly they won't admit that it has more appeal to them then a merchant or builder themed worker placement.

Ya lo he jugado 3 veces, no me ha gustado, simplemente me parece que no está bien hecho (bajo mi humilde impresión); cuando empieza a estar interesante se acaba la partida.

RATING: 4
It lost its lustre as I played more games. This definitively has the "streamlined" factor, but the nuts and bolts are a bit too obvious - the whole 4 / 2 / 1 balancing act that runs through the whole game means that the only real way to get ahead is a) Combo the right cards which means b) Draw the right cards (quests) and c) Don't get hit with the mean stuff. This makes it fine for a few plays, then it's just all auto-play with few decision points of any interest (that isn't to say it's solved or any such thing, but that the draw to consider my decisions in more depth simply isn't there while playing - hence auto-pilot).

A smooth ride, suitable for most people - even if they've never played games of this sort before - you can be up and ready in less than 5 minutes. Also, it looks pleasant and the whole comboing quest card abilities is a bit fun.

A fine game.

So many pieces - a lot to put together and put away.

I have never played D&D in my life, but I love worker placement games, and this is a fantastic one in my opinion. You start out with a nice selection of spots to go to (and a few extra if you include the expansion), but that will expand as all the buildings in this game are additional worker spots. All players plays as a secret lord who gives bonus points for certain quest types or buildings, and the goal of the game is, of course, to have the most points at the end of the game.

The game is really easy to teach, the iconography is very straight forward. It scales really well, though I personally prefer to play with a lower player count as you get more workers the fewer players there are in the game. Though the more players there are in the game, the better the effect of at least some of the intrigue cards in the game. I think three players is the optimum sweet spot for this game, but it really works well with two (which is the player count I play the most).

If you like worker placement at all, this is the game for you.

A very simple and direct worker placement game.  Easy to teach and learn.  Get cubes, translate into points.  The game is totally without any thematic attachment whatsoever, and the fantasy art (except the board, which is gorgeous) is forgettable.  The box is a thing of beauty and the 'bits tray' is pretty impressive.  Cartainly not a top 100 game, but a pleasant diversion that has stripped worker placement to its most base level, and does it well.

This is a sleek, entry-level worker placement game that gets just about everything right. Could it be deeper? Yes. Will it replace Caylus? No. Could it be more fun to play? Probably not. It's fun as is. One thing I really like about it is that you are always moving forward. The frustration factor is low. It's about points, points, and more points. I can't wait for an expansion (PLEASE DON'T MESS IT UP).

It's average at best. The couple times I've played it, it has lacked any tension. The decisions are rarely interesting and it seems like the game is over just when it is getting started.
6-28-2013 Initial rating 6.

After playing the game some more with just two players, it is starting to grow on me. The number of actions you get to take throughout the entire game grows significantly with fewer players. This makes it easier to get an engine going and allows you to more easily link together quests. The intrigue cards become less effective with two, but I feel like the blocking has more friction than with more players.

Quite fun. Delivered as expected - after watching Tom Vasel's video, I knew just what I was getting into, and while I did need to read the rules, I found that there weren't that many. My son was able to pick it up quite easily, and play well enough to enjoy it. There isn't a ton of depth, but that is more than made up for by the fact that I could bring it to the table with pretty much anybody. It wouldn't be my first choice for gamers, but much more satisfying than your typical 'family' game.

I played this only once, with the expansion with the skulls. It was a fun game but i had too much the idea i was exchanging colored cubes for cubes in different colors. The background story was vague to me.

It seemed to me that the expansion was the most interesting part of the game. Can't compare off course. With the expansion I would give it a 7, without it, i'm not as likely to play it again. Certainly not interested in buying it.

Positive about it: I won the game, while I was not even sure what i was doing. So I think almost anyone can play along and do fairly well.

Lords of Waterdeep is an introductory worker placement game that includes the basics of the genre along with the quest system, a straightforward way to give newbies a clear goal for play. I like how all of the different mechanics (i.e., the intrigue cards, quests, secret lords, adding new action spaces through buildings) fit together into a nice package. However, in the end I always feel like there should be more - something more to build, something more to do.

My son and I play this game regularily at the local board game store.

RATING: 6.5
You get pawns, which you assign to specific locations over the board, which in turn gives you resources (fighters, clerics, mages, thieves, money, etc) that you need to complet quests (which you get at the start of the game, a few, then you also must use the pawns on specific locations on the board to get more quests). As soon as you meet the requirements of a quest, you can complete it, getting its reward (usually some victory points, sometimes you also get toher resources). The winner is the player with most victory points at the end of the game.

It's a rather simple, not long, eurogame. As many say, the theme is kind of thin, but it is there, and I like the reversal (usually you play the heroes, be it a videogame or rople play, or boardgame, here you play as the giver... not exactly, but sort of).

Funny how an "euro-ized ameritrash" game can be a good thing. This however, is an "americanized eurogame" and only suffers from the fusion. The reason "take that" mechanics aren't in economic euros is that they don't belong, it's not because no one ever thought of it.

It's not bad, it's just worse.

This was my introduction in to worker-placement games and I dig it.  Partially because of the theme and setting.  I did, however, "have" to splurge and get the Broken Token meeple so that way I didn't have to personify blocks.  The added visual helps you think of your henchmen as actual people being sent on missions as opposed to resources being thrown into a bank to buy points.

Dungeons & Dragons: Lords of Waterdeep. A worker-placement/resource-management game. It’s basically just like Agricola, but faster and easier, (there’s less of the “Oh, no, my family’s gonna starve!” in the game.) It’s easy to understand with gorgeous pieces. Definitely will appeal to D&D fans for the theme, but I think that's why I, (a not-so-avid D&D player,) don't think too much of it, despite it really being a pretty decent gateway game.

I'm always a bit surprised by the love for this one. It's a pleasant little worker placement game, but it's nothing you haven't seen before down to the painted-on theme. Finally got to play the expansion and the game is definitely improved for it- corruption adds consequence to some choices, and some of the new buildings, quests, and intrigue cards really show growth.

RATING: 6
Very smooth and streamlined introductory worker placement, as many have said before.  However, not my cup of tea, as there are a few aggressive plays that players can make to pretty much break your game (as has happened in both games I've played).  Maybe more experienced players will be able to plan for these things, or maybe some house rules could fix them, but in my opinion, a little too cut-throat for a nice easy game.  Also, (again, agreeing with countless others), it's pretty tough to get into the theme with the "resources" being cubes.  They're supposed to be different classes of adventurers, but most players just gave up on that and called them purple cubes or white cubes, etc.

Technically, a well-made game perhaps, but not one that I fancy.

RATING: 4
So hyped and overrated for such a underwhelming rehash of mechanics and game play.

It's yet another stupid worker-placement Euro with a pasted on theme. Maybe it's just me - I mean it's worker f***ing placement - and I just can't seem to care about putting my workers onto spaces to collect some resource which I will then spend at a later date to collect VP. It fails to feel meaningful, even with the thinly pasted-on theme of D&D and the attempt to make it more thematic with Intrigue cards.

The whole experience was one big bag of holding full of meh. I won't say no to future games, but honestly, if I am going to play worker placement at all (and it's rare I want to), I will still prefer the food-crunch tension of Agricola, the fiercely tight management required by Pillars of the Earth, or the butterfly effect and area control of Dominant Species.

Well designed and very well paced worker placement game.  Materials are very high quality, and storage organization is one of the best I've seen.

Only two criticisms: 1) The theme is a bit light. Feels a bit like a fantasy game as long as you use the quest names and collect "fighters, clerics, wizards and thieves" and not just orange, white, purple and black. 2) Some of the intrigue cards can be a bit too strong.

One of the best gateway game's I've played, with the right expansion this game could become even better! 

The only place where it falls short as a base set is the cubes. The designers choice of cubes over mini-meeples, in general, hurts the theme. Reducing the gameplay to quotes like this "I need two black and three orange", where it should be "I need two rogues and three warriors".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This was never terribly exciting and, after several plays, has started to get old. The decisions aren't that tough, so I'm pretty much on auto-pilot during most of the game. I don't really like cube conversion games that much, but forgave this one because I appreciated the theme and was impressed that it played in just an hour (once). Everyone else thinks it's themeless, and every other session's been at least 90 minutes, bordering on "too long for what it is." Although everyone I've introduced it to has enjoyed it, I simply don't find it interesting enough to view it as a keeper.

Note that we mitigate luck by by not distributing any Quest cards at the beginning of the game.

A light worker placement with a nice fantasy touch (it should not always be set in the old ages :-)). Interesting twist to the worker placement mechanics with the quest cards and secret lords.

Still need to play the expansion.

Mediocre worker placement game. D&D theme makes me sad how much I am not feeling it. We are just running around moving cubes and that is all it really feels like. Quest cards don't make any kind of logical sense with what you need for them or what your reward is. No guild group has any kind of fun power making them any different. No special items to help you build your power...Even for a "Euro" type game it is fairly dull. The expansion makes the game a little better, but not enough. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I played this one not really expecting too much from it as I am not wildly enthused by D&D products these days and have played plenty of worker placement games so that I expected this to be a bit old hat. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was nothing of the sort. The game played really well and was thoroughly enjoyable from the start. The game play is clean and easily understandable and there is enough variety to make it very replayable. The production values are very high and the theme does not feel entirely ‘pasted on’ (theme does matter to me).

To paraphrase the late, great Victor Kiam, "I was so impressed I bought the game". Since my initial foray, I have managed to play a couple of two player games with Mrs Fish and she enjoys it as much as me. I see this one as a keeper that will get plenty of use in the years to come. The only minor gripe I have is that there is a promotional card that is not readily available the complete-ist in me hopes that this will be incorporated into a future expansion (yes, I’d buy an expansion for this one).

RATING: 7.9
When taken in stride, this is an interesting, smooth-flowing, light worker placement game.  At the start of the game, you are randomly dealt a personality: some are very easy to score with; others require you to get lucky draws from the large stack of objectives and intrigue cards.  If the needed cards don't appear, it can be frustrating from the first turn and leave the unlucky player with a bad impression of the game. 

2015-07-12:  There really is a good amount of lucky with the way intrigue cards & quests come out during the game.  If someone gets a 40-point quest at the right moment, that one lucky draw can swing the outcome.

An all around great worker placement game. It's intimidating to new players, but is surprisingly easy to teach and learn. Even though it is relatively simple, there are still plenty of interesting decisions to be made. 

I like the buildings element - the idea of spending resources to add action spaces to the board is cool. Opponents will want to use the spaces because they are really good, but they also help the building owner. Plot quests are cool too, as they can be nice little bonuses, or completely change how you play the game. The same applies to the intrigue cards. 

The worker placement mechanics work out well - you always have to think ask which action will be more effective? What spaces can I take now, and what can I risk leaving for my opponents to take? What is my opponent going to do next? 

However, even though there are cool combos to pull off with quests, buildings, action spaces, and intrigue cards, a lot of those things come down to luck of the draw. It isn't too bad, but sometimes it sucks. 

I also don't particularly love the idea of the hidden lords, in the sense that often, the best way to play is to just comply as much as possible with what your lord wants. Also, the lords are hidden, but figuring out which lord card someone has doesn't really make a difference.

Overall it is a solid game. I enjoy it a lot.

RATING: 9
Excellent worker placement (WP) game. The D&D theme is pasted on; but the rulebook is wonderful, the gameplay is linear without hidden traps: just sit down and fight for grabbing cubes to fulfill your quests. At the end, VPs will run like a jackpot.

If you want to start with a WP game, play this.

A nice worker placement euro. The mechanisms work well together, there is only little randomness and more player interaction than the average euro thanks to intrigues.

I have never played Dungeon & Dragons but that hasn`t stopped me from loving this worker placement game. The theme is pasted on and gives nice flavor to a game that is essentially a strategig cube pusher. Familiarity with D&D world isn`t essential in this game and I find it a good thing. Worker placement mechanic works well and I like the recipe gathering thing that involves in completing the quests. Game board is tight enough for three players but gives little bit too much space to maneuver if you play only with two.  Overall, it scales beautifully and is a lot of fun.

This was fun as we played in a 5 player match, but it didn't offer anything mind-blowing (surprise surprise).  It's fine as I don't own a lot of worker placement games.

Another Worker placement game, one with so much hype.. 
It's a solid game with lots of nice bits and pieces.. But nothing outstandingly different to shine above the rest..
It has solid and tight game play and you never know who is going to win right until the revealing of your secret identity..
It's not exactly a game i crave to play, but never the less gets played more than games i rate higher, purely as everyone i have introduced it to, understood and loved it..

Caylus light. Quicker and easier on the brain due to less second guessing of opponents moves compared to Caylus. The theme is wafer thin but is the best worker placement gateway game I've seen.

A great entry level worker-placement game with a fairly thin D&D thematic overlay but it is nice enough for some artwork and flavour text. 

It has been hammered in some circles for being a simple 'get resource here and spend it there' cube pushing exercise but for me the game works really well and is a great stepping stone for newer gamers into the world of strategy games before trying marginally more complex titles in the genre like Kingsburg and Village.

I've only played the iOS version, which seems solid enough. I like the theme and the looks very much, and it's really quick and easy to play. There is something very cool about the smoothness of just placing your worker and taking the action. This is so probably thanks to the iOS version, which removes the handling of the cards and the fumbling with the cubes as you just tap away. Anyway, I'm sure I would like the board version just as well. The expansion removes some balance issues and adds variety and theme. Pricey, but so is life. Well, the iOS version actually isn't...

Fairly quick to pickup but still fun for the advanced player. 

This game is a worker placement game with gaining units that then "complete" missions which is really just turning in the units for the completed mission. It is fun has some flavor with the unit types and cards.

A decent gateway Euro. Quite a bit of fun. Some of the secret identity cards feel a bit unbalanced, and I feel as though luck plays more of a role than I like. The generic D&D theme is a little tired by 2017.

[b]Like:[/b]
-The satisfying feeling of finishing a quest

[b]Dislike:[/b]
-Theme
-Not really any tension compared to other worker placement games

It was fine I guess? I had a hard time feeling the theme though (and if you're using fantasy as a theme, that's a problem). For being an organisation that has agents to send out (which sounds cool!), I didn't feel like one. You'd think agents are there to spy or sabotage your opponents, but the only way they really interact with them is... standing in their way?

Speaking of blocking, there are usually so many quests going on, I found it hard to keep track of what my opponents needed, so I didn't play to block them and just acted out of my own interest. When I got blocked, it wasn't really because the opponent wanted to ruin my plan, it just so happened to be that we needed the same but they got to go first. I feel annoyed (only slightly though since there's many back-up spaces) and the opponent doesn't feel particularly smart.

The other way to interact are the intrigue cards. There are probably dozens of different ones, but it doesn't really matter what they do: they either buff an opponent, so you give that to the losing player, OR they hinder them, so you give that to the winning player. Not really a point in having so many different ones. Buildings also definitely don't feel like buildings I built, just more spaces to got to.

And this is probably nitpicking, but I liked it better in Champions of Midgard that the meeples are about the size a human would be on the map, so it really feels like they're walking around town. Here, the city is so zoomed out that it just doesn't feel the same.

I mean, the game does nothing bad really, it's not that I got frustrated by the mechanics or anything, it's just that I didn't really get excited by them either. Completing quests is comparable to completing routes in Ticket to Ride, but that game is more straightforward (no text) and funnier.

And why do I loose all my recruited people when I complete a quest? Are they all dead or something? This might as well been a game about being the most successful spice manager, fulfilling contracts by selling spices.

Champions of Midgard is the better game.

This is the new favorite at our house.  Absolutely fantastic insert that everything fits into. Once packed correctly (with a touch of OCD), you can turn the box upside down, shake, and everything is still in its spot!  I love that some of the coins abide by the old money thinking of: "if I can sew it into my clothes, I can hide it" (aka, there are holes in currency...for a reason....)

Onto gameplay: you are a lord of waterdeep, which really means nothing unless the cards you get bonuses are shown...and you can pick them up....You have people to do your bidding!  You actually go on quests to get resources and victory points (I call them Ruppees) so you can quest more.  You can be a total asshat, or genteel depending on your table situation.  As someone whose played DnD since 3 (yes, I'm young),  I like the flavor and easy mechanics of this game.

Finally got a chance to try this much hyped game.  Well, bottom line is that it's a nice medium weight worker placement game along the lines of Stone Age.  I understand the Caylus lite comments, and agree with them.  It plays quickly, has more interaction than Stone Age, with a Fantasy theme that may appeal to some and turn others off.

I'm not familiar with this D&D theme, so the theme does nothing for me.  Stone Age or this title, makes no difference to me.  I did enjoy the player interaction portions of the game, but prefer the player confrontation in Carson City.

Personally, I enjoyed the game and would be willing to play again.  However, I'm not looking to own this title since I already own plenty of other worker placement games with and without direct confrontation (i.e.  Dungeon Lords, Caylus, Stone Age, Pillars of the Earth, Carson City, Age of Empires 3, Egizia, Tribune...).

I would recommend this game for folks that want a quick playing medium-light worker placement game with some light player interaction, and are OK with a fantasty theme.

If you have some of the game titles I listed above, I don't know that you really need this game.  I don't.

Classic worker placement game. Everyone agrees the game is mechanically good, it's tight and just the right length. Even people who don't 'do' D&D enjoy this game. It's a fine game, but I'm not about to sing it's praises like it's the best game ever. It has staying power as an entry level game, but I haven't played it in years because there's better games in the genre out there.

So I bought this game expecting it to sit on my shelf and get played once a year or so. Read the rules and ran a mock through by myself. The rules were pretty simple and the game play was pretty quick. Somehow I talked my wife into playing. I didn't think she was going to like it because she hates Agricola, and this game is in my opinion, slightly like Agricola. (Slightly) You use your agents to perform tasks that get you points. To my surprise, the wife really enjoyed it. We have only played it once, but I can see us playing it at least once a month. (Don't have time for more, way too busy.) She is not familiar with Waterdeep or the theme, so she enjoyed the game just based on the way it is played.

The game takes about an hour with two people and a person who has never read the rules was able to really begin playing within 10 minutes. There is a little luck involved based on Intrigue cards or just the way the quests and buildings come up, but mostly it is strategy. Do you do something good for you, or bad for someone else? With a limited number of moves and rounds, you really have to plan ahead. My wife spent too much time trying to stop me and not enough helping herself, so I managed to eek out a win. (That strategy usually works for her.) All in all, a really good game.

Light-medium Euro with DnD theme. Nice fast-paced game, but with not a lot of decisions to make. Basic worker placement with every player fullfing his Quests, through Intrigue and city building.
Very good for introducing new players to worker placement, or getting Ameritrashers to play Euro games.
The theme could be stronger in the game, instead of the players calling "I get 2 black cubes, and give 1 black, 3 orange and a White one to do this card".
It should be more dnd-ish "I hire 2 rogues, and sent 1 of them with 3 fighters and a cleric to get the Chalice of Destruction" or something like that.

Waiting impatiently for the expansion.

Thematic Euro where you place agents in the fantasy city Waterdeep to acquire money and factions to complete quests and score. Decisions and illustrations give a good feeling but the interaction could have been higher; partly it's difficult to see which needs the other players have on their quest cards and partly it's often best to focus on your own needs anyway rather than blocking your opponents.

I love this game beyond all measuring, especially with the Scoundrels of Skullport expansion. It hits all sorts of good places for me: worker placement, hidden goals, competitive, but mostly non-confrontational, and one of the best inserts out there. I still got the Broken Token insert, though, because it allowed me to get both games in the same box.

Good intro worker placement. Feels different enough from Stone Age, although I go back and forth on which I prefer. Something about slinging cubes and completing quests is satisfying, even though the game is not particularly deep and the winner can depend on the luck of the card draw and how players choose to use the mandatory quests, which makes it a bit arbitrary. 1-3-13

I'm done with VP race eurogames that don't feature a compelling core mechanic. I'm done with what they propose, I'm done with what other people see in them that I don't. Lords of Waterdeep is your run-of-the-mill worker placement game; which saddens me, because worker placement being genre in the collective consciousness of board gamers is symptomatic of the focus on how actions are selected rather than what actions do. Mostly in order to hide that those actions are actually quite dull: gain resources, grab a card that converts resources into victory points, convert resources into victory points according to a card, build new spaces providing slightly better ways to do all the previous. Multiplayer solitaire in a big mathy puzzle.

LoW is no exception and even worse than average on the player interaction side: there is always a desirable and easy-to-determine best option, then an equally desirable next best option. Blocking happens, but as long as players are aiming to win, such an interaction is incidental, moves being only decided with the intent of optimising personal efficiency. Intrigue cards don't change much, at most they randomly hose players for working on tight resources without any leftovers, but they are diverse enough you shouldn't constantly plan around their effect and rather just accept your fate.

Perhaps if you happen to guess someone's secret identity, when choosing between two similar quests you'll pick the one that the leading player wants the most; but that's the extent of the game's appeal to me. In conclusion, if you're unsure about the whole eurogame thing, I would suggest you try Lords of Waterdeep; a very approachable entry point complexity-wise with great production values. Personally I can't recommend it, but more on behalf of its whole genre that makes me feel like I'm doing my taxes.

So this is what worker placement is all about?  Well, the theme grabbed me, and the gameplay kept me.  Definitely opened my eyes to more euro style games now, and I'm interested to see how well the games it is based on play.  The components are pretty cool, although the map of Waterdeep itself is kind of a bland let-down - was hoping for something a little more colourful and interesting.  Good game overall.

RATING: 7
As someone who doesn't know what's D&D, it's a lighter caylus that has three things I don't like - the use of mandatory quest to target a specific opponent, only one building can be bought each turn (and can't be built by resources!) and having to keep track of all the face-up quests your opponent control. 

The good thing is the intrigue cards adding variety and the choices as to fulfill the quests you own or spending time to get the quests that will be benefits you more. 

Also, it plays fast, support up to five players, and new players can be competitive the first time they play the game. A pretty average game at its core, but it's very easy to have this game started.

Good game, the design (except from the cubes which feel bland) is very good.

But it's lack of originality and bland feel (I'm not feeling like someone doing missions in a D&D world or even a guild sending them in), makes this game only an 8 for me. Not the 10 I'm sure a lot will say. Its still a great game, but not a 10 or a 9

Got some small wooden meeples resembling the actual types of the cubes. This improves the games feel.

Its a generic worker placement Euro cube-fest with the DnD theme shamelessly slapped on. Place your meeples, get colored cubes, cash in for vps. You've done this a million times before. But now you can pretend the orange cubes are fighters. heh.

Constructing action spaces (buldings) adds a nice twist, but it seems to me the buildings don't cycle nearly fast enough to make them worth it. You usually only get to see about 10% of the building stack due to the limited open space on the board.

Love the tray and the segmented box.

In this worker placement game, your workers are agents who recruit rogues, magicians, clerics and warriors  that are represented by different colored cubes. You then use the adventurers to complete quests to score VPs. Each player also has a secret card that allows them to score more VPs depending on the type of quests that they fulfill. There are also intrigue cards that allow you to throw a wrench into your opponent's plans. You can make them fulfill mandatory quests first, or get cubes for your benefit, so there is a fair amount of targeting opponents with nuisance cards. Now to be fair, I haven't played a full game, and would like to play a full game to see if the nuisance cards are that random.

RATING: 8.9
1. It's a euro game. The theme is painted on. They're called clerics and fighters but they're white and orange cubes respectively. This is to be expected. It plays like a worker placements game. However, despite the painted on theme, the amount of fluff inserted into the cards, rulebook, and fluff through text and art means that it can be played completely abstract but if you do dig deeper, you get the impression that there is more going on. So it's actually cool. It's like theme-optional which is nice for a euro game which largely have no theme besides art. This is better than that.
2. It's better than how I imagine Pillas of the earth and Agricola are as worker placement games based on what I know. It's an hour instead of two hours. Once we started, it didn't feel extra slow by being our first game, but it did take 15 minutes to really learn rules and set up which is is a one time only deal. I still want to play those other games but based on watching plays online, reviews, descriptions, etc. I feel like this is more streamlined, fun, fast paced but that's a lot of speculation.
3. As a euro game it didn't leave me going "that was epic" or "amazing" it was fun, light, and accessible as an economic/worker placement/euro game. Nothing AMAZING but that's to be expected--a relaxed game.
4. Despite the previous point, I actually compared this to other euro games I owend or had played, and I realized that I THINK I still enjoyed this, even on our first game, more than any other euro I had played including settlers, carcossone, either beowulf game, ticket to ride, anything by Knizia including lord of the rings or Samurai. Truth be told, I can't actually think of a euro game that seemed to have a higher fun factor and be more enjoyable despite the fact that it didn't blow me away because it was quite relaxed.
5. I like the improved player interaction through intrigue cards. This puts it ahead of MOST euro games alone, just in the fact that it's not completely competative solotaire.
6. Just the right amount of depth. It stayed accessible without being bogged down but the number of choices, options and strategies seemed truly huge, even blowing away other deep euro games.
7. The only other euro game that felt more thematic was NInjato but this one may be overall a bit better and certainly more accessible. 
8. The components lend themselves to a real elegance and despite the tiles and cards beinga  bit delicate, they look amazing. The components, boards, cards, and tiles, make it EASY to remember the rules and the options you have.

If you like euro games but are wary about the overly bland light ones or wary of the overly heavy stressful ones, Lords of Waterdeep may very well be the perfect blend of a medium-light medium tight euro game that has satisfying gameplay and scratches the itch for a strategic and cereberal euro game without trying to be overly innovative. It is not by theme painted on alone, that this game was more enjoyable than other Euros.

Based on what I've read and played, I'd recommend this over any euro game I've played or owned so far and even agricola, pillars of the earth, etc. So far, no one has challenged me with a euro game having a higher fun factor than this--even carcossone which has more luck than this and a wonkier famer scoring system.

RATING: 7
Introductory worker placement at its best. I actually think 'Dungeons & Dragons' theme could put people off a bit if they think it's very complicated or highly thematic: in reality this is one of the most lightly themed games I've played. Definitely recommend some sort of fine system for people referring to 'cubes' instead of different classes of character, otherwise the theme is gone altogether!

Great game. Yes, mechanics used before, but put together into a nice, medium light mix that flows.

And, yes, it has theme... if you read the cards.

Some people complain about the lack of thematic components, but I feel the game is otherwise engaging enough to make you forget about that flaw.  Assembling a parties of adventurers to complete missions is a nice change from gathering wheat and other prehistoric resources.  My only complaint might be that the Intrigue cards seem a little swingy.

Now THIS is what a worker placement game should be.  I suspect this may move up to a nine after a few more plays.  One member of my game group said this will replace Belfort for them. Simple mechanisms, imminently teachable even to less experienced and it won't take but one turn for everyone to feel like they are playing competently.  

Subsequent plays:  This one is not holding up as well over time.  Regardless of the unique buildings that come out, this has a very "same-y" feel to it from game to game. There is no getting around the fact that the bits are boring. I will keep it in my collection, it's a light game that will probably be a good gateway.  

Update: The new expansion reinvigorated my group's interest in this game.  It is a good end of evening game that everyone knows how to play without a lot of discussion so it works well as our gateway or casual game.

Simple euro game with fairly elegant design. I don't like the insert, though I can see why some may appreciate it. Its not very thematic and rather dry though. Even though its a good intro WP, its hardly anything special.

EDIT: After several more plays, I can see the elegance of this game's design and appreciate its clarity, speed, and simplicity a bit more. I'm still keeping the score at a 7, but I appreciate it a bit more.

Edit: scratch what I said before. I like the insert more now, though ill still baggy it all in the expansion box. The theme also comes through much stronger if you let yourself become immersed.

Even so, the game does still get a bit old quickly IMO.

RATING: 8.5
This is an interesting game. For folks that just want to treat it as a worker placement game, it works, and works well. It's pretty easy to just call everything by colour and score your points.

For the folks who want to get more out of it, or who like the D&D theme, you can certainly do that too. I find it to be a lot more fun if you do. Play intrigue cards on the the other factions by name. Say you're sending an agent to recruit fighters, then read the quest out that you send them on and score points with.

The game is simple, but engaging for the entire time. It plays quickly and has a set length, lasting less than two hours with a full five players. Well worth the investment, you will get your value out of it...and your gf will probably even play it with you.

Pretty good game, but standard.

The buildings and quests are fun, the flavor text is always fun to read in an over-the-top medieval doomsayer's accent, but there isn't anything in this game that makes it special compared to other worker placements.

It's a good worker placement, in a sea of lots of mediocre worker placements, but there's nothing that makes it hooking, so... 

Good it will remain.

Perfect casual game. It has some nice decisions to make during gameplay, but not so deep that every player needs much time to think about it. For this reason it's a great gateway game.

For the moment 3 plays, 2 with 2 players and one with 3 players. Great variety of cards and buildings, I am surprised every time with new intrigue cards and buildings that I have not played yet and each game has been different enough to bring me to think that It has good replayability. We'll see with more plays.

The best: Player Interaction -> Greater than in other gateway games like dominion, 7 wonders, etc...

The worse: It's one of the best entry games I've played, but for hard-gamers we'll see how long it lasts, not enough long-term strategy and no different ways to gain VP...

I had to buy this game.  A great blend of fantasy theme with the solid game-play of an Euro.  I appreciate that the theme is there even if it takes some players an extra effort to call the cubes by their proper names (clerics, fighters, rogues and wizards).

Lots of choices to be made, especially from the 5th round forward. The intrigue cards are good but definitely not disastrous to anyone's plan.  They are not harsh take-thats but more like subtle delays or quite nice boons.

My girlfriend likes it very much and I'm eager to play it again and again.

Worker placement at its basics, but a whole lot more. Strangly gives me a feeling of TtR, when it comes to the Quests(/Tickets). But a more direct messing with your opponents with the Intrigue cards, which I like.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A worker placement game that is very easy to learn, but figuring out the optimal move never seems obvious. Essentially, you send your workers to locations to gather cubes to match those printed on quest cards. The more cubes required for a quest, the more points you get.

Sounds so simple it should be boring, but the theme makes it work for me:
As one of the secret lords who rule Waterdeep, you send your agents out to recruit adventurers, who in turn go on quests on you behalf.
There are different quests, like Skullduggery and Warfare, that require different adventurers, like Rogues and Fighters. Different lords also focus on different quests.

The secret lord part is mostly a gimmick that adds very little to the game, as there is little to no advantage in figuring out what your opponent is focused on. If anytning, it actually weakens the game, as your secret lord forces you to possiby ignore 60% of the avaiable quests.

There are also buildings to buy, adding new places to visit. These are usually better than the locations printed on the board, but offer a reward to the owner. 
This adds a nice touch to the game; making you choose between a weak location, or a strong one that also helps you opponent.
It also adds replayability as the huge stack of buildings make sure that no two games will be the same.

You get a different number of agents depending on the player count, so this scales very well.

There's a really neat insert, except they made the spaces for coins and VP-tokens to small...
Also, the board has room for a sixth player that comes with the expansion, but the insert doesn't...

A fun, light worker placement game.  The aesthetics and components are really well done.  The theme doesn't matter at all in this game, and the fact that the theme doesn't connect in any way to player actions really hurts the immersiveness of the gameplay.  The quest cards and secret objectives do help to keep gameplay interesting.  Some of the intrigue cards are clearly more helpful than others.  Other worker placement games implement global conditions that affect all players, and I think that would help make turns more imperative rather than one player simply playing intrigue cards on another player. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Another worker placement game which, like Ninjato, could be said to have a pasted on theme. But unlike Ninjato, which doesn't really deserve that tag, I think it's a fair enough criticism when levelled at Lords of Waterdeep. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the game. It has lots going for it. The gameplay is very smooth, it's easy to teach and it plays pretty quickly. The aim of the game is to complete quests which you do by recruiting the required number of different adventures. The problem is, I felt like I was collecting the right number of coloured cubes rather than completing quests. That's okay to begin with but I like my games more immersive. That said, the presenation is fantastic and I need to play with three or four players to really judge it. Edit: Played with four and it worked well. Same reservations apply but other players enjoyed it.

Lords of Waterdeep is an excellent entry-level Worker Placement/Set Collection game. Where LoW scores over starter Euros is probably the feature that most hardcore players despise: Each player is dealt a card in secret at the beginning of the game which gives endgame victory points for completing certain tasks. This basically outlines the strategy that player need adopt to remain competitive against the others. Great for a novice, but a veteran Euro player might find this removes their ability to choose their own path.

Lords of Waterdeep feels thoroughly play-tested, resulting in a slick production, right down to the components. Every conceivable component, however unnecessary, is included, once again angling to an introductory feel. The player boards, for instance, don't give any gameplay information, but do provide players well-defined spaces to store their personal holdings. The game board made room for reminder spaces for victory points that are added each turn to unpurchased buildings. LoW even comes with an excellent box-insert, mapped out in the instructions showing where everything is stored!

After many plays it has become evident that there is an imbalance in the quests. Arcana quests are too simple to achieve for the high Victory Points and bonuses they reward. This imbalance translates to a higher win percentage for anyone with a Lord that benefits from Arcana quests. This imbalance may force a replacement of LoW.

2-5 Players are vying for control of the city of Waterdeep.  A worker placement game where you are completing quests that require gold, thieves, fighters, wizards, and clerics for points.  An identity is passed to you in the beginning dictating what quests you will be shooting for for a bonus at the end of the game.  

In the beginning there are quite a few actions, but as the game progresses more buildings come out and add more fund actions to do during the game.

A very simple and intuitive game that plays quickly and is a gem to play.

RATING: 9
It has a bit more razzle-dazzle (read: thematic) than Caylus, but Caylus is the better game. In a few ways, Waterdeep is more fun -- the notion of spending resources to complete a chosen quest rather than build buildings or the castle; the secret objective; the intrigue cards -- there is that luck of the draw factor that makes card games fun. But for the same reasons, it's a less balanced game. Finally, the king-making mandatory quests force astute players to play dead, which isn't a bad thing [i]per se[/i] but tips the game slightly from the strategic. I do have a good time every time I play it though, and maybe that's what matters.

[color=#117bc0][b]Probably rather play:[/b][/color] Caylus
----
downgrading from 7.5. Nice bounded game length of 8 rounds (if a bit randomly chosen), but starting luck plays too much of a difference. Say you drew a starting role that pays 4 extra for warfare quests, then your dealt quests are both warfare quests, one of which pays 2 extra for warfare completed -- it's a lot of overpower in a game that tends to have close outcomes, and the wrong kind of luck for this type of strategy game. Perhaps it's remedied by not starting with any quests?
----
...ah, who knows, maybe this is just a pitch-perfect blend of Ameritrashy chrome and euro. Gameplay doesn't drag, and there are decisions throughout that require thinking through. The Skullport (corruption) expansion adds such a natural, yet simple depth to the game, with surprisingly well-integrated buildings, quests, and intrigue cards. It's a 9 with Skullport, and a 6.5-7.5 without.

D&D themed WP, and I have to say, a lot of fun. Not a lot of interaction, but that's not a terrible thing in and of itself. I liked it a lot, because the D&D theme really ties the game together, much like the Dude's rug did for the room.

5 plays of LoW under the belt, and... man, I don't know.  It feels like streamlined Caylus to me.  I appreciate the shortened game length, but it's at the cost of player agency.

I'll play it.  It doesn't suck.  But it doesn't grab me much.

I know this game gets knocked by a lot of people who are veteran worker placement gamers, but I really like this game.  It was the gamer that introduced me to the worker placement model and led me to get into some more in depth versions of that mechanism. 

But I love how easy this game is to teach and play and I like the basic strategies it engenders.  The components are great, and while the theme is barely noticeable unless you work at it, I still like the connection to D&D.

There are times when I want to cook a 3 course meal and times when I just want a simple but delicious dinner.  This is the latter and I enjoy it for that reason.

You acquire money, cubes, quest cards and intrigue cards by worker placement. Intrigue cards provide some player interaction (and unpredictability) and may provide cubes, money, and quest cards. Cubes and money are turned in to complete quests on quest cards, that give VPs, money, cubes, quest cards and intrigue cards.
This is a thematic tactical game with no strategic depth that could be enjoyed by non-gamers. For gamers I would recommend worker placement games that require and allow a bit more planning ahead.

A hit with everyone so far.  Good intro to worker placement, nice theme. Replaced cubes with D&Deeples, they really help with adding some theme and should have come in the box with an appropriate board.

RATING: 8.5
I'm partial with this game because I'm a longtime D&D fan, and I also adore worker placement games... The perfect combo for me!

The only mechanic I don't like is the mandatory missions (it's ok as balancing and catchup mechanism, but they are too powerful, especially in many players game when you can be asfixiated with many of them).

Apart from that, it's not an original game, but it's very straightforward and fluid, with fast gameplay that appeals to most players. It's also allows for a different numbers of players without resenting too much. 

The classic example of a game that doesn't add anything new to the game world, but does everything well.

Soundrels of Skullport is one of the best expansions of the gaming world. Really worth it.

This has rapidly become one of my favorite worker placement games.  Great theme, great mechanics.  You can teach it in under five minutes and it seems to be very well balanced.  And even though it's a purely aesthetic change, splurging to purchase the D&Deeples from relax makes the game just that much better.

RATING: 6
First impression (4 players): We accidently misplayed a rule and probably made experience better for us. We did misplay in a way that if you go to play your I(ntrique)-card, you do not get to do anything but play it (normally the guy gets to do some leftover action too. This reduced the value of I-cards and therefore there was less hitting of other players which I personally like more.

Other than that it felt that there are too few quests in rotation and game wasn't all that exciting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very good game.  Only played it once thus far.  The reason for the 7.5... felt like some of the quest cards when completed gave a HUGE advantage to the player that obtained them. Looking forward to playing it again, rating subject to change.

Edit 7/4/13: Second play, and it is already better.  Still feeling like some of the cards are really powerful, but there are enough of them that the balance feels better.  I will continue to keep an eye on this one.

Filling tickets through very simple worker placement. Both the tickets and the take that cards generate quite a bit of chaos and point swings. 

Moves very swiftly unless someone needs to stop for reading the text on buildings or cards.

Quite a bunch of poor component and layout choices, for example the box, the insert, the huge empty area in the middle of the ugly board, general visibility issues, and counters not matching player colors at all. But they have done one thing right: Buildings are sturdy tiles instead of cards.

Rating after 20+ plays, covering the entire range as far as number of players.  Fun & interesting thus far.  Fairly interactive as Intrigue cards provide opportunities for screwage but don't seem crippling or overpowered.  Scales very well throughout the player range...

Lords of Waterdeep is a worker placement game where your strategy has massive effects on the game.  You play the game however you want for the most part - and it's a game of come backs in my recent two plays.  Each time the winner was trailing by 20-60 points in the first half, to the point where people simply would be surprised when they moved a few VP.

There's so much to do in this game and the replay value is considerable.  Depending on the quests that are available and the buildings players have purchased can change how you play.  Some plays go for hard VP advantages with the most potent quests.  Others go for a mix of intrigue and efficient quest completions.  And then others also focus on the Lord they drew.

I myself focus on appeasing my Lord by getting the quests that give me the bonuses.  Playing against veterans they can see through your charade and may begin blocking you, but these sort of moves can have consequences for them.

I just love the strategy involved!  It leaves very little to be desired.  And players become more and more involved as the game progresses.

Each time players are sort of dawdling for the first round or two.  By round 4 or 5 they are hovering over the board, contemplating complex moves and thinking turns ahead.  Even my little brothers get a lot of critical thinking done playing this.

GET THIS GAME PEOPLE!

RATING: 7.5
Ricorda molto Caylus questa sorpresa del 2012. La maggior differenza la vedo nella presenza delle carte che rende il gioco vario con strategie molto differenti da partita e partira, ma al tempo stesso aggiunge un po' di fattore aleatorio che potrebbe far accaponire la pelle agli amanti del gioco di William Attia. In questo gioco i Lords di Waterdeep devono cercare di risolvere Quest per avere vantaggi e fare punti vittoria. Le azioni sono sempre molto poche e qesto rende preziosa l'influenza sugli eroi o il possesso dei più importanti edifici della città. A mio avviso un ottimo titolo.

Fun worker placement game with a nice, clean implementation.  The only negative thing, in my opinion, is the nerdy, pasted-on D&D theme.  Fortunately, the theme is subtle and easy to get past.  Overall, a very enjoyable and accessible game.

Update: As of 3/31/2013, Now with DnDeeples!!! ...thanks to a birthday gift from a very good and generous friend.  It's definitely a luxury item, but if you can swing the cost, I highly recommend the custom meeples offered by BGG user "Relax" (aka Danny Perello).  These little guys look AMAZING.

RATING: 7
Standard Euro game with a D&D theme. The theme doesn't add much to me as it doesn't even feel like D&D (there is no defeating monsters or anything that feels remotely like battle), but the game is actually good. I like the buildings mechanic to customize the worker placement board differently every game. Artwork is nice, and even though the board is just a meaningless "town", it's a nice looking map. I did feel like the game went on for too long (8 rounds)- cashing in "quests" got repetitive. Would play again for sure though.

Worker placement probably more on the simpler side, but I just love how "smooth" this plays, how easy it is to teach and how well it actually also plays with different player amounts, although as in any worker placement the pressure is of course very different playing 2 or 4-5 players. And even though the theme is not that strong, I still do enjoy it and it's enough to bring some atmosphere to the table.

My personal favorite among the Worker placement games.

This has an attractively illustrated board and cards, as expected of a Wizards of the Coast game, which helps immerse you in the game. I also like all the different quests and map locations, which have character, and can be a bit of fun to read out in silly voices (if such be your bag).

The pace really picks up in the last two rounds, and you have to think very carefully about your moves.

I have played 4 times, but haven't sussed out the strategy yet, as each time I have come in with a lacklustre score, despite thinking carefully about how I played.

LoW is an interesting Worker-Placement game which is easy to learn and has attractive components. There is fun tension as players compete for their preferred placements. The board is attractive and there is excellent art on the cards. After the first play it has been easy to teach and generally well received. The only criticism of the game-play has been that in the early stages it is possible for players to be shut-out (if several players use Intrigue cards aggressively).

The components are another matter. Colourblind players have difficulty - the game uses purple and black cubes which are difficult for people with normal vision to distinguish; bright light is needed. The situation is made more difficult, however, because the symbols for different adventurers (i.e. the cubes) are tiny pictures of cubes. Grrr! Not only are these really difficult to see at a distance, the colours vary - some "purple" symbols are sky-blue on my set. I would enjoy the game quite a bit more if it was not a memory exercise.

Takes between an hour to two hours.  Lots of choices for players to make, but not a complicated game.  The 'screw you' cards add a bit of chaos and leader bashing which I hate but, otherwise, I don't have any complaints about the game.  I have played over 100 games, if you count iPad plays.

Given the chaos and 'screw you' cards and the length, I would never want to play this with more than 3-4 players.

You can't really get an engine going but smart players will be able to optimize points generation through placement order & quest order. Fun to play this one thematically with my son, sending adventurers on quests.

Holy cow do not play this with more than 2 or 3 players. In fact the mechanisms are pretty uninspiring as-is, so I think I'll actively avoid this in the future. The game is pleasant, but if I wanted pleasant I'd take a nice walk in the park with a fine cigar.

One of the best inserts in board game history. Streamlined and an excellent way to introduce new players to the worker placement genre. However, this game is far too simple and the attempt at a theme gets watered down by calling everything "cubes" rather than what the theme says they represent. There is not enough variety at the end of the day, and although you can somewhat pursue different avenues to success, it's really all the same thing. This is only good as an opener, or for gamers who do not like complexity and varying win conditions, or to teach new genres to players.

Wonderful components, engaging worker placement mechanics and well considered theme (it's a bit of a shame that it has the heavy-geek D&D theme mind you as it makes it harder to convince non-gamers to join in). I played a fantastic solo variant of this which I saw on bgg forum - really good fun. And the best component tray ever.

So far the only worker placement game I truely enjoy. Yeah, I used to play AD&D in my youth, and yes again, I played Forgotten Realms, so my perspective is blurred by nostalgia. However, the game turned out to be very thematic for a Euro at heart. Gameplay is light and easy and satisfactory.


MY COMMENTS IN GERMAN TAKEN FROM WWW.UNKNOWNS.DE

2015-01-12: Das erste lupenreine Arbeitereinsatzspiel, das mir ehrlich gefällt. Ja, ich habe früher AD&D gespielt, und ich habe dabei sogar hauptsächlich Forgotten Realms gespielt. Ja, ich habe daher einen nostalgischen Blick auf D&D. Aber das alleine ist nicht der Grund. LoW ist wirklich thematisch geworden und bietet direkte Interaktion durch die Intrigenkarten, deren Nutzung das Spieldesign durchaus zu begünstigen scheint. Das Regelwerk ist übersichtlich und gut geschrieben. Wir hatten keine offene Regelfragen. Die Spielschachtel gefällt mir auch. Schade nur, dass die DnDeeples so teuer sind. Mit Figuren anstelle von Holzwürfel wäre es vermutlich wirklich noch mal schöner und thematischer.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]This game has continued to see consistent play in my house, my wife and kids all really enjoy it. I think this game will continue to see table time, especially since my wife may choose it when it is her pick for family game night. We have also played some 2p games and also enjoyed this, the game plays very fast with 2.

I have to admit that I am a bit surprised that this is one of the family weight worker placement games that has survived the Jones Theory culling (the other being my wife's favorite - Stone Age). Since we had so many worker placement games I trade a few away to make room for other games (Fresco, Kingsburg and Ninjato were traded. Personally I preferred Fresco but the rest of my family did not agree.). 

All that said I still think it is an excellent, family weight worker placement game that I always enjoy playing when it comes out.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (9):[/COLOR]

[i]Worker placement games have always been a hit in our house.
I was initially turned off of this game, in part because I figured it couldn't live up to the hype. I finally got the game and have not regretted it at all.

- My wife loves this game, which is always a huge + for me.
- The DnDeeples are amazing an really increase our enjoyment of the game.
- I love the artwork on the board/cards. Really well drawn fantasy art, everything is easy to read and understand.
- Family friendly design; my wife and older kids found it easy to learn played really well from the beginning. This is a very easy game to teach, the only area my daughter needed some coaching with was helping her figure out how important playing Intrigue cards could be.
- Turns go by very fast, there is not much AP in this game.
- Intrigue Cards: These make the game for us, they introduce a lot of direct player interaction.[/i]

An excellent medium weight and possibly gateway game to Euros! The game is very simple to play and easy to learn, relearn and teach. The options are seemingly endless as to what you can do on a turn. And once players start buying the building tiles, the options become even more interesting with every turn. This game has so much going for it, so many really well balanced options and really fun options, that you almost don't care about winning.

The box storage is really wonderful; however, if you sleeve the cards they no longer fit in the awesome storage tray that lifts the cards when you press down with your finger. I have gone to storing them under the box insert.

Not bad for a worker placement game, and mercifully short. It has a bit of Caylus (buildings and converting stuff into other stuff), a bit of Agricola (resources pile up) and some card drafting.

If you're looking for a worker placement game that plays in a reasonable amount of time, provides some variety from game, has a bit of luck, has just a touch of stop-the-perceived-leader, then this is about as good as it gets. It's a shame it's gone with cubes to represent the clerics, mages, fighters and rogues you'll be recruiting to finish your quests, instead of miniatures or another better class of components, because it emphasises that the game really is nothing but gathering your cubes as efficiently as you can and then trading them in to satisfy quest requirements. Satisfying quests earns VPs, as do people using the buildings you've built (yes, Caylus style, but at least here the buildings on offer are a random draft, not the "always the same" race to get the same buildings out first that you seem to find in Caylus). There are Intrigue cards which can be gathered and played to either hit the leader or (the more usual) do yourself good (usually some style of gathering yet more cubes). Get more VPs at the end of game if you've done quests that your secret mission dictates, see who wins. It moves along pretty quickly, finishes in the right amount of time. If you don't mind the luck (of the quests on offer, of being hit, of missing out on the worker places you want), there's a decent amount to like.

It's a very good worker placement game. The D&D theme is really just tacked on which sort of bugs me.  If I'm playing a D&D game, there should be dice-chucking, killing monsters and grabbing treasure.  That complaint aside, this is probably my favorite worker placement game that my group owns so I still enjoy it despite the D&D theme issue.

Impressive Fresh Worker-Placement Set-Collection Fantasy Quest-Mission Game !! Very smooth play. Not too heavy, not too light. Plays about 60-75 minutes. I would consider this to be a beer and pretzels game. Quality and beautiful game. I like the setting and feel of this game. Rather than a dungeon crawl, it's a euro about a city-hub for parties doing dungeon crawls.

Mixed feelings about the adventurer cubes. It might've helped the theme/feel to have some mini-miniatures, but then cubes would better endure the constant handling. 

I'd like to try it with 2 players.

RATING: 7
"Solid, if unexciting, light-medium worker placement game. DnDeeples are worth buying if you own and like this game."

What I like:
- Hits a nice weight: not too heavy, not too light
- Theme is appealing, although cubes detract (the DnDeeples are great)
- Most of the components are excellent

What I don't like:
- Mandatory quests often hit someone in 2nd or 3rd place
- A fair bit of randomness, esp. w/quest draws
- The box. The insert is very well done, except for squeezing the money and VP chits in

It felt less like Caylus Magna Carta than I had hoped, because buildings here are a bit of a side show. But the game flows well, and there is plenty going on. It definitely has that worker placement feel, with blocking and competition. With 5p, having only 2 workers per round feels very tight.

Quite a different game with 2p that with 5. You have a lot more actions each turn, so you can get more done. And it is a lot harder to block someone (intentionally or not). There is no bash-the-leader or kingmaking, and the MQ's don't feel at all mean. It becomes less chaotic and more thinky, and with 2, the value and importance of buildings is far lower. 

With 3p, you definitely have more actions (like 2p), but you have kingmaking (like 5p). Overall, I guess I would rate 2, 3, and 5 about equally.

It seems to be a 90-120 minute game for us, at any player count. I don't think we can get it down to 60.

It's a good game, but currently is overrated and overhyped. With 2 other people in my groups owning it, I'm sure I'll have plenty of chances to play it, so I sold my copy. If the hype ever dies down, I might overcome my character flaw of preferring underdogs, and might raise my rating. I agree with the current voted weight of 2.5.

This is WAY better than a D&D licensed game had any right to be.  In the base game, the way Waterdeep Harbor operates holds the game back.  The Skullport expansion does fix this however.

The theme doesn't really come through despite the licence and the attempts (quest names etc) to tie it in.

What it is though is a very good WP game. Easy to learn - certainly for our group who have played a lot of these but I'm sure also for newcomers as it's very instinctive - and it all clicks together well. Finite number of rounds make it surprisingly quick, I like the staged addition of an extra worker at mid game also - just as spaces are typically getting scarce.

The production is gorgeous - all the board and card art, but also the smaller things like how all the pieces fit perfectly on the board. As for the inlay - either it's perfect or annoying having to fit everything into space each time

The base game is just ok. It is a good introduction to worker placement. The expansion makes the game an 8 for me though by making the buildings and board actions much more interesting. I prefer to play without Mandatory Quests but I don't mind playing with them. They don't ruin the experience too much for me.

Worker placement, and resource handling. Lot's of peoptle compare it with Caylus. But there are many othr games with similar mechanics. 

It's packeted in a nice D&D fantasy theme.

The box is tacky, although with nice artwork. The inlay is almost very good.

After first play I thought the game was so-so, but it grows on you.

And it gest better the more you play, so I had to raise my rating.

I have raised my rating. This is a often played game in my gamegroup nowadays. Has enough variation, and strategy to make every play fun. 

It's obvious that Larissa is good with three players and difficult with five. 

We houserule three things: 
1) you are dealt five quests in the setup and chose two.
2) with the expansion you are dealt two lords and chose one.
3) not played mandatory quests are taken out of the game in round 5 (if you have or draw new, replace them with other intrigue cards).

Raised rating from a 6 as of November, 2013.  The game is a great introduction to worker placement for new and casual gamers.  I find that it builds very well off of Ticket to Ride: the concept of the route tickets in TTR translates quite easily to the quests in LoW.

This is a good game to have in my collection in that it fills that casual couples gaming niche.  I won't be pulling it out with veteran gamer groups, but it's a good one to have in reserve for a more casual night of gaming because it allows conversation and socializing while providing a fun, light game experience.

15+ plays - A fantastic worker placement game, with a theme I like. Instead of rounding up lumber and metal, you're rounding up adventuring parties made up of rogues and priests (among others). What makes this particularly great is all the new worker locations that open up as buildings are opened. Plot quests may give you incentives to prioritise particular things, while utilising buildings may advantage your opponents who own them and gain a residual income when you do so. As the game progresses there are increasing amounts of factors to weigh up. Nice to look at, simple to setup and explain, catch-up mechanics are there for beginners, not much to complain about.

A light worker placement game. There are few options each turn and you do not have a lot of workers, so the game should not last more then an hour. You are basically collecting cubes (who are different factions) and sending them on quests to earn points and other bonuses. You have a leader who will give you a bonus at the end for completing certain types of quests. Very straightforward for a worker placement game.

I sold this on after a number of plays because I found that I wasn't finding the game challenging or fun. It is definitely on the light side of worker placement but there isn't enough tension on the board for me; no matter what people take before you, there is always something left behind that you will be happy to take as well.

A very good worker placement game, with a strong D&D based theme. 

My only issue with this game are the mandatory quests. I hate to receive them, and hate to play them on others even more. The simple solution is to take them out. They would have been far more interesting if they asked all players to put forward a resource to complete the quest. If enough is given, the quest succeeds and the participants receive a reward (money, points), otherwise, the non-participants suffer a penalty.

A very straightforward game, which should make it an excellent gateway game, but I think that the theme lets it down in this respect. I really enjoy it, even though to an extent it's simply putting your pieces in the most obvious place based on what cards you have, but because everyone is doing the same and only one piece is allowed on each space, it makes the game more tense and means that you have to keep your options open.

26/10/13 Still really enjoy this game. Everyone I have introduced to it has gotten it. It comes out a lot in groups because of its simplicity. My wife and I have started gravitating to slightly heavier games so, when it is just the two of us, we prefer something like Castles of Burgundy or Ora et Labora. But we still like this one a lot.

Leveraging the Dungeons & Dragons license, Wizards of the Coast has designed a worker placement game that offers something for nearly everyone. Lords of Waterdeep is reasonably brisk and is as easy to teach as it is to play, making it a fabulous introduction to the genre for new players. However, despite being something of a gateway game, Waterdeep also requires a number of strategic choices throughout, though is careful not to overwhelm players with having to make too many decisions at once. The game also includes a variety of different cards that provide a welcome taste of player interaction beyond Waterdeep’s worker placement gameplay. It also helps that the game scales really well, making it a fun and welcome experience at any table.

Despite its D&D moniker, this was definitely a Eurogame, a worker-placement game in the style of Caylus, to be precise.  You place your workers to get resources in order to be able to buy buildings or complete quests.  The intrigue cards mixed things up a bit, and I really liked how they essentially let you do two things at once.  However, I didn't like that many of them forced you to pick on individual players, sometimes at no benefit to yourself--it didn't really seem to fit this sort of game.

Quote Eddy Sterckx: "Super-light worker-placement game with only tactical choices and no long-term strategies due to heavy randomness. Plays fast, which is a plus but it's not something I'd like to play on a daily basis. This game only got into the BGG top-30 of strategy games due to its (pasted on) D&D theme."

Solid worker placement mechanism.
It´s a mercy for casual gamers. 

The map design is prosaic.
The illustrations for the cards, seem to be a conglomeration of average "fantasy" leftovers, dicovered in long time unopend drawers.
No disturbance by any fantasy flair appears, while you try to figure out the next placement for your "agent".

This is a current favorite of mine.  While nothing in it is revolutionary, it perfectly blends a lot of good aspects.  I like the theme, the buildings like Caylus, the various quests, and the interaction of the Intrigue cards.

My main area of improvement is that the Lord cards are too similar and vanilla.  It would be nice if future expansions had methods of different Lord scoring abilities.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This game sounds like the most ridiculously derivative stereotype of a Euro game ever. And it is! This is the kind of game I would design if I wanted to make a parody of Euro games. However, LoW has gone beyond parody, into the realm of genius. This is elemental Euro game, boiled down to its essentials; an archetypal worker-placement, cube-hoarding masterpiece.

Never once do I feel like I am gathering warriors, priests, and wizards in a tavern, and getting them to help me complete quests. That, of course, is not the point. The point is to have a silly, pasted-on theme. I am gathering cubes, to play cards which give me points, and sometimes more cubes. There are spaces where I can put my workers, so that they will get me cubes. There are cards I can play to destroy my opponents' cubes!

This game is fun as hell.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Really great. Everything about this game is solid. The design of the pieces is first rate (aside from the cubes which, literally, lack character). It simple to play and the worker placement is really rewarding. Its like a hugely cut down version of Agricola.

I'd like to see some more in depth quests. Perhaps multi-part quests with varying objectives.

Pre-ordered the expansion :)

Made by an American company; this very nearly qualifies as a Eurogame, but then they added in that mechanic where you use cards to screw over certain players.  I assume they intended to use it as a balancing mechanism to make sure nobody gets too far ahead.  The problem I have found is it's extremely unpleasant to be sitting at a table and four other players have decided I'm winning too much so they're cooperating to find the best way to sabotage me.  I prefer Power Grid style balancing where the board contains natural disadvantages to being in front.

11/16/12 - I didn't think much of this game and didn't believe the hype. I head that this game was like Stone Age and while I really wanted to like Stone Age, it was too simple and the theme wasn't my thing so I ended up trading it. I was browsing games and I saw a tutorial on how to play LoW and it looked much better than I thought. The game is really simple to pick up but has a ton of interesting choices that keep the game exciting. (Rating: 9.0)

Decent gameplay, but I feel it's overrated. Combines the geekiness of D&D with the dryness of a cube-pushing Euro, stripping away any sense of story (which is surely the greatest appeal of the fantasy genre?) while leaving a nerdy residue of wizards, warriors and quests, so I'm left feeling slightly dissatisfied with both aspects. I think I would have preferred it if it had some cliched Euro theme such as medieval city building. 

I also dislike the mandatory quests - with the importance of action efficiency, it can be incredibly frustrating having one played on you at the wrong moment - especially in the last round of the game. And I'm also not very keen on the secret role mechanism as it can lead to imbalanced overlaps - for example in a 4-player game, if 3 players are collecting Warfare-Arcane, Arcane-Piety, and Warfare-Piety, the 4th player collecting Commerce-Skulduggery has a clear advantage as they'll face less competition.

Straightforward worker placement with a straightforward VP engine. No surprises here, and remembering that warrior cubes are orange hardly reeks of theme, but this one appeals to me more than, say, Aquileia, which has a tighter economic/placement engine but is less forgiving.

What I like about LoWD is that the Intrigue cards may throw some chaos (and the quest draws are, of course, random) but the chaos-creation generally doesn't cause a devastating amount of damage. In sum, being effed with won't hurt so bad because you almost always have other, feasible options, and there's no rush to get things done THIS VERY TURN (which is nice). Finally, the "mandatory quests" can slow runaway leaders without much cost to the one who assigns them.  In many worker placement, such "blocks" or obstructive acts are more costly.

Not bad, not good either. You almost feel bad criticizing the game because it doesn't have evident problems or broken strategies - it's just that there's not much game there (without the expansions at least). You get a guy that likes magic related quests and stealing stuff, you try to get those quests when they seem doable.

I have yet to have a boring session of LoW.  Even for (as my friends are) the "thematically challenged," this game entertains.  I get into it, imagining sending my thugs out to recruit various adventurers.  I get into it, and it works for me, too.  Great game for all types of gamers.

i think of this as a second-level gateway game, introducing players to the concept of efficiency.  it is a good game but the intrigue cards needed editing.  played this game enough, so i traded it.

Here's a worker placement game that is simpler than Caylus and even simpler than Stone Age, but it just works. The theme is a bit stronger, and it omits the fiddly bits of those other two games (the castle, set collecting, feeding people) to make a more streamlined game. I still like Caylus more, but this might displace Stone Age as a fun gateway game with a mechanic non-gamers likely have not seen before.

A very very fun game!
Could do a bit more with a little theme (there's D&D theme, and sometimes it feels good if you read out the quest card description like "2 wizards and 1 cleric have helped me domesticate owlbears", but there is no urgent theme that you are working towards)
That being said this is an EXCELLENT GAME. Easily one of my top 10s.

This game brings absolutely nothing new here... It's been made a hundreds of times already... They just copy pasted it from other euros and put a D&D pallet colours to it... on top of that the theme doesn't even fit with the mechanism...

A blend meaningless euro worker placement type of game. There are many other euro-style games that I would rather play instead of this.

A waste of time... pretty disappointing since I had high hopes for it... profound sadness...

Played twice so far.  Strategically, it's a lot like Agricola.  Game is very good looking, easy to learn.  Don't own it long enough to know how well it replays after a dozen plays so this score may come down if it doesn't.  So far though, a great game.

The game has some swingy luck, but otherwise has a lot going for it.  Quick and intuitive, but with a surprising amount of depth.  Also some top notch production quality (the best box insert I've ever seen).  I can imagine this one's not for everyone (the DnD license alone might be enough to turn some off) but an excellent game nonetheless.  I was worried about swingy luck (there's a lot of drawing cards) but after repeated plays the strategy seems to be standing up.

Solid worker placement from WotC. The fantasy theme is unintrusive and depending on the play group it can be anything from a straight up cube pusher to a fairly thematic experience where Lords send adventurers on quests for the good of the city and personal gain.

The Lord cards lack variation and the game might feel a little vanilla after a few plays, but that is fixed with the expansion!

Now this game is a tad to simple for me, but its a great chill, yet compeditive game to pull out for non-hardcore gamers. I do enjoy it once i get going with it, but where this game really shines for me is all its appealing mechanics. Buying the buildings and collecting tax for every enemy lord that visits it, beautiful. This is one of my go to games for new gamer snaring.

One complaint, the take that cards in the game are much to in-complex for me, this is mostly fixed with the modular expansion

Worker placement game in a D&D world.

Send Agents to gather warriors, rogues, wizards, and clerics. Take on quests and use intrigue cards to stymie your opponents or gain an advantage.  Complete plot quests for ongoing bonuses, and build buildings to gain the owner's benefits or new actions.

You can completely ignore the RPG theming if you so desire.

A great gateway worker placement game that's easy to teach and plays very smoothly. Even though the theme is more or less pasted on, it still helps make an attractive game. 

The take-that elements and randomness of the quests/buildings/intrigue cards make for a functional "equalizer" that can be frustrating at times, but overall the game does what it's set out to do pretty well. It's accessible enough that even my stepmother-in-law took a liking to it. 

This is probably my most pimped out game which is funny because I don't even like it as much as my upgrades alludes to. The DnDeeples, Meeple Source corruption tokens, and Broken Token insert and coins cost three times the cost of the base game. I am insane.

This is another worker placement game. I prefer it to most of the others for two reasons. First, there is some player interaction with the implementation of the Intrege cards. Second, and possibly most important, the board changes from game to game depending on the buildings that come into play. In short the game is more dynamic than any of the other worker placement games I have played.

Aside from some occasional fun screwage provided by Intrigue cards, I just wasn't feeling the intended theme of "political intrigue and shady back-alley dealings".

The game drags while you await your turn, and it's hard to read cards & buildings if you're beside or at the top of the board. It's also hard to see your opponents' player cards; so player interaction & screwage are minimal. It feels more like 5 people playing solitaire than a 5-player game.

Dull as ditchwater.

Ordinarily I'd shy away from this game based on the whole DnD tie-in.  My game group convinced me it was pasted on Knizia-style, and to just enjoy the game.  Funny, I could get past the theme (not half-bad, actually).  But the game is so derivative of Stone Age and Caylus that I found myself bored (yes, [b]bored[/b]) playing it.  The others were having a pretty good time, so maybe it's just not the game for me. (though I did win)

Imbalanced, unoriginal, obvious and just plain dull.  

[i]edit[/i]: played two more times: 2nd and a win.  Still boring enough that I never have to play again.

Fast worker placement game. Really good gateway game for the worker placement genre, with a nice 'build buildings' mechanic similar to Caylus but without the pawn that removes the spots from happening. The lord character cards are all a little same-y except one (who is a bit broken as she either loses or wins depending on how many other players build buildings), and the mandatory quests are just jerky as they tend to go to the player who just scored rather than the player about to score.

This has quickly become one of my favorite games. It is a big hit in my gaming group and we have played it many times. We don't get bored with it and re-playability is very high. I think this is one of the best games released in the past few years. Clean and strategic euro game mechanics combined with a classic fantasy theme. Highly recommended to anyone who is a fantasy genre fan. Bring on the expansions!

I suggest two variants for those who may want a friendlier game and tweak the starting quests to allow a choice: My "no mandatory quests variant" and the "smoother starting quests" variant. They both can be found in the variants forum section. We use both of these in my group and the game is enhanced and feels improved compared to the basic version.

RATING: 6.5
This game is a nice compromise between the feel of a "euro game" and an "ameritrash game." While the mechanics are a somewhat simplistic worker game, moving around the victory point track feels a little like moving around the board on a traditional American game.

For what it tries to do, Lords of Waterdeep does fairly well. It would go well when you want to play a board game with people who aren't board game geeks, but the theme seems a little out of place for a game like that. It's also excellent for when you want to have a conversation while playing a game, or need a game to fill in a brief gap of time.

I have only two real criticisms. The first is that the game is just too short. By the final round (#8), I feel like the game has finally found its stride, there are sufficient interesting choices, and then the game ends. The really interesting quests and building are the ones that have persistent results, and they just aren't worth building when the game is nearing its end. I think houseruling in 2 more turns, or adding an additional end condition (such as 'all building slots are filled') would amend this.

The biggest criticism I have to raise is about the Lord cards. There's a lot of untapped potential here that could have been interesting, but all the lords (with one exception) simply award 4 points for doing quests of one of two categories. One of the lords gives 6 points for each building they control (Way more interesting!). The problem with the Lord cards is they're supposed to be this big secret, but people will probably start playing their quest types fairly regularly, and it isn't very subtle. 

I'd like the Lord types to be more diverse, and to have more options added to the game that let you directly interfere with what you think another player's lord card is. Right now, the only real way to stop someone seems to be playing a mandatory quest, which usually isn't anything more than a minor annoyance. I'd like some options that would devalue what they have in their tavern, or let you pick where they put one of their agents, skip them once in the turn order, etc.

An enjoyable game to bring out on a weekday evening after my husband is finished with work. He loves it even if he has yet to beat me. It's not terribly taxing but requires more thought than fillers. The Intrigue cards add spice to an otherwise very straightforward worker placement. I can see this being a good gateway game for anyone who is into the theme. Typically I ignore flavor text but because the theme is a bit pasted on and the cubes don't lend themselves well to enhancing that, I've taken to reading the flavor text aloud to get more of a thematic feel. I'm not in love with the game but it's solid and I won't be getting rid of it anytime soon.  In fact, I know I'll be playing the hell out of it since hubby is smitten.

Man nehme das langweiligste, billige Eurogame mit geringer Ressourcenvielfalt und kaum Komplexität. Hinzu kommt eine Priese Diplomatie, ein kleinbisschen "ab auf die Fresse", ein fantastisches Inlay und eine Tonne Action - mit aufregendem (wenn auch austauschbarem) Thema, wilden Illustrationen und stimmungsvollen Kartentexten.... und man erhält dieses grandiose Spiel. Einfach genug, um es mit Neulingen zu spielen und dabei ein spannendes Hin und Her. Wirklich ein super Spiel- umso ärgerlicher, dass es dieses Meisterwerk nur auf englisch gibt (auf deutsch gäbe es vielleicht sogar Bestbewertung).

So Lords of Waterdeep is a worker placement game where the actual work you do serves only to give you resources you need to turn in quests, which then in turn give you VP and sometimes more resources, or recurring bonuses onto actions. You can buy buildings, which when used by others gives you a small bonus, but doesn't force that bonus to come from the user. Because of the limited nature of the actions (namely in them only giving you small amounts of resources, not like the accumulating resources of Agricola, being start player each turn is highly valueable. This was mentioned while the rules were explained, and it certainly bit me in the ass, by the time I was feeling marginalized enough that I needed to get start player, the material cost of doing so, namely the loss of one of my two workers, would just cost me even more than it was worth.

In addition, each player is given a hidden end of game scoring condition (for me it was completing commerce and piety; before the game started a lot of trash was talked about how piety quests aren't worth the effort, which discouraged me from putting much effort into that). I find that hidden goals can be frustrating, because suddenly you know that everyone else is trying to do unknowable things for extra VP, while you're stuck just struggling for VP in general. At the start of the game I had now commerce or piety quests, and there were none in the market, and so I started trying to get the blocks I needed for my quests. Of course, people started playing their actually good intrigue cards, which they used to pretty much take away the blocks I had already gotten (although I had only gotten those blocks because the actions for the blocks I wanted were already gone). So I got four points from my "Lord of Waterdeep" while the others got.. more. It's frustrating when everyone wants the same things, and so by going later you get no resources, so going first is only going to deprive other people of things they already have gotten.

At least with Agricola (I'm so sorry I have to make this comparison) players sorta have to sacrifice useful actions sometimes to get food at harvest, or will not take an action so it can accumulate more resources (both of these features is absent from LoD). I really felt like after maybe two rounds I would need at least three uninhibited agent placements to feel like I could accomplish something. There are probably groups I could be willing to play this with again, hesitantly, but that "hesitantly" has a big fucking chip on its shoulder.

'Agricola Lite' with less random scoring is a very good description of this game.

Much easier to introduce new players to, although it has a very different theme - which is sometimes an advantage and sometimes a disadvantage; depending on the players.

Has a couple of abilities that allow you to go in a worker placement slot that someone else has already been in, which helps a lot.

Has a further advantage over Agricola in that you can add buildings (which are slots for worker placements) but you gain a benefit when one of the other players go in your buildings, even if you don't use them.

The buildings are quite key to the game.

One of my favorite worker placement games so far, Lords of Waterdeep doesn't feel much like D&D - sure, you'll send warriors on quests to kill beasties, but you do so by assigning cubes to cards to get victory points. Always a surprisingly close game where you can win or lose on a single move.

RATING: 7
Played this a few times in real life, and also have played quite a bit in the app. I like it and think it is pretty smart, but I also find the theme weak and the gameplay not inventive. It's a fine and fun enough game, but there isn't anything particularly exciting. Replay-ability is also somewhat of an issue for me as all my games just blend together--there aren't really enough reasons to try different strategies outside of the one lord who encourages purchasing buildings.

This has been my favorite game for some time now.  It leaves little to be desired.  With the expansion, plays 6 players and is very balanced regardless the number of players.  Has a D&D theme, but when I explain the rules, I always tell players that they are allocating workers, collecting resources to complete recipes.  The theme can be ignored.

Nov 2014:  One of our current favorite. Tear-down and reset time are little long (see below) but this is a great resource game. The game plays different with the expansions - larger groups don't suffer the early game constraints which makes it feel similar to small group play. The challenges (in a large group without expansions) are that the last players can lose turns because no moves remain. The 'go first' position becomes much more valuable.

Broken Token Insert: you must get it... fixes set up /tear down

It's the kind of game where you can read and teach the rules in 30 minutes and it plays in under an hour but you will still feel like you've played something deep. I didn't know that was possible but Wizards of the Coast did it.

RATING: 8
I think this is a very good game, and a great gateway game for introducing non gamers into the concept of the worker placement mechanism. It's not overly complicated, and takes between an hour and 90 mins to play.

My wife isn't really a gamer, and I thought it would be best to test the waters with something a little easy. See how she feels and move from there. At the moment, we've only played the game with two people but having a lot of fun, and she loves it!

Overall a solid game!

I love this game! I'm intrigued by the Euro game style, but have always been put off by the length and complexity. I respect 'em, but they're just not for my group! Lords of Waterdeep fits perfectly, though. It's light enough to easily and quickly explain to new players, and also plays quick enough to finish a game in about an hour to an hour thirty.

Even though it's a fairly simple game to learn, there's still a load of choices to make, and all of them are fun. The game feels balanced as well, with every spot on the board getting used. Some turns one spot may be highly contested, but a round or two later and a different area(s) is probably the center of attention.

The theme is excellent, though the choice of blocks for Rogues / Wizards / etc... abstracts it a bit glaringly. Instead of sending a group of adventurers as per the theme, it ends up sending back a certain number of orange / black / purple blocks to the supply to get victory points. The game could really use some figures for the classes.

Ooooh snap, a euro/D&D. The group I play games with new favorite. Play time 50-70 minutes. You can play this at work during a lunch break! And the best part is, if you are a grown man playing boardgames at work, there are not many bosses that will call you attention for being back to your desk late because they think you will murder them.

Reduced rating from 7 to 6. . . . This is a REALLY pasted on theme. . .  It is a Euro.  The last time I played it, it was fun, but there was nearly NO interaction.  The two of us (Yes, it was only a two player game) looked down at our respective taverns the entire time.

I am not a fan of worker placement games at all, but I enjoyed this one because it's light and not bloated like so many other Euros available right now.

I really enjoyed the intrigue card mechanism. If you use a worker/agent to play an intrigue card, you can reuse that worker again at the end of a round to use another building/action.

Unfortunately, the board has dull, uninspired artwork.

RATING: 7
Only played once, At International TableTop day.
I tend not to like getting my backstabby conflict in my Euros.
It just gets so unbalanced to have those initial character roles so random - in our game, 3 people had Piety bonus. The other 2 players had a HUGE advantage from the first draw. I'd have to guess the building gal has a large advantage, since there's never any conflict and it's easy to build buildings if you focus on them. I got 3 and wasn't trying much. 5 would be easy, I'd think, and provide bonus from the buildings (which are their own reward).

A great game for non gamers. Its easy to explain and just get playing. Not something Im bringing to game night but if I have some family members over I am more than happy to get this out and play it. Also there have been a few times I have gotten this out at home to play. Definitely one I will be keeping around. Looking forward to digging into the expansion.

:update:

Just played first play with expansion and I really love what the expansion offers. I like the risk of taking corruption early on to get out ahead and then the race to try and make up for your sins by dumping corruption before the game ends or else take a huge penalty. Made an already good game better without adding complexity or bogging down explanation to newcomers.

I really wish I played this more than the one time. Unfortunately I'm not 100% sure I see a need for it since my family already likes stone age and viticulture. Also, they don't like "take that" so the only thing this game kind of has going for it that is different is negated. On the fence of trying it again/trying to essentially teach them a new game again vs selling it... vs getting the expansion and hoping it brings enough new stuff over the other games to warrant teaching them!

I usually shy away from games that use resource management mechanics and worker placement mechanics, but this game made something that is usually painful to me something enjoyable and reasonably simple.  It looks very busy, but that is not the case.

RATING: 7.5
I find this game to have a sucky theme. I love D&D and play the RPG regularly but this is not D&D. The mechanics are good and the game plays smoothly, but there is a real disconnect in the theme. My first three plays, I really liked it, but it has lost a bit of its luster due to the dumb theme. Still a good game that I will play periodically, mainly because the wife likes it. ***Wife:9.5 

Update: The Skullport expansion takes this game to an 8.3. There is a bit more theme, and there is a lot more meat. Really enjoy this game with the expansion, and I could see this game getting more plays.

RATING: 8
One of the better gateway eurogames I have played - with simple rules that can be taught in about 10 minutes (or even less), but with many interesting decisions, even though it's just a basic implementation of worker placement.

What makes it for me is the random component of cards and buildings. Each game feels fresh, because you aim for different quests and you have different resources available. And while sometimes you feel like the fortune gods are messing with you on purpose, somehow there's always the urge to play again. Not too thinky, not too hard, but definitely not mindless. 

My only criticism is the mandatory quest mechanic... Sometimes it becomes a kingmaking tool, especially when used by somebody who's already on the losing position. But that's a minor complaint - other than that, the game's a brilliant entry level eurogame.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Just OK.

I'm not a fan of worker placement in general, but I gave this a chance because of the theme. Unfortunately the theme is only skin-deep and there really isn't much else of interest to me about it. If other people are setting it up and there aren't any other options I'll join in, but would never request it or push it myself.

RATING: 9
Great to see a light worker placement. After all, there's a slew of heavier euro games using this mechanic. Over in an hour, fantasy theme, quests to guide your choices. Perfect family game.

Personally, decision making is light. Only rarely do you get REALLY shafted (although I haven't played with more than 3 players) with others jumping in before you. A good alternative to Caylus. I also really like the Intrigue cards. They're hardly "take that" FFG-inspired. The worst is the mandatory quests and losing a single cube/adventurer.

Only, sadly read the rules. I suspect it will turn out to be a solid 10.

Or it's just me and I've had too many DnD sessions. And too vivid imagination. Really promising.

Although there aren't really that many paths to victory, the obstacles and advantages that you encounter on those few paths change with every game and can potentially even evolve during the course of a single game.  I like the fact that you don't get to see every building in each game.  I also like the fact that, even though you are initially pretty constrained in your choices, new options can quickly and unexpectedly arise from the Intrigue Cards, quest rewards, and building benefits.

I prefer the 3 player game over the 5 player game.  It is more open and less chaotic, but still maintains the tension of having to try to be as efficient, productive and crafty as possible with your moves.

Great game which is very easy to learn. 

I set it up the first time while reading the manual and only looked in the manual once or twice while playing it just to confirm if I was doing it right and turned out I was. 

I really like the beautifull design of the cards, and the storage in the box is done in such a perfect way which makes the game quick to set up, many components dont need to be removed from the box even which makes it quick to put away everything when the game is done.

Great game - perhaps just a tad too light for me.
I usually quite like 'take that' in a game. This game doesn't have much, but the few Mandatory Quests that is in the game, seems just a bit too unbalanced. The persons targeted by Mandatory Quests is heavily set back compared to the other players. Especially in 4-6 player game.
Even more so, when the targeted player isn't even in the lead, but primarily targeted because he/she has the fewest cubes and thus have to put the biggest effort into completing the quest.

EDIT: After several plays I'd much rather play something else. Even with the expansion thrown into the mix the game is a drab experience

What a fantastic game! To some this may not equal much more than moving cubes around a board, but the theme really clicked with me. The intrigue cards can get really nasty. I especially dislike being delayed by mandatory quests, but this sort of interaction gives the game some much needed spice. I love the way the different Lords give players a different strategy to work with each game. My favorite mechanic, however, involved the way building cards create new locations on the board for all players but give the builder an extra boost each time they're used. Being able to guess your opponent's strategy can lead to some powerful moves. Overall: This was an instant favorite.

A fairly standard worker-placement game, with a bit of take-that for spice. After one play, I'd call it reasonably fun, not too deep, and not overlong given the amount of luck in the game.

This game is a lot of fun.  It moves very quickly.  It's a nice touch that you can build buildings that become spots for worker placement (that are often more powerful than the original sports on the board).  When people use "your" spots you get a benefit.  I also like the fact that you can place in the harbor and get a benefit and then replace the game meeple (at the very end of the turn) to get yet another benefit.

I'm surprised my kids don't like it more.  Whenever I suggest it, they want to play something else.

This game is an outstanding introduction to the concept of worker placement. It's SO easy to learn this game and it is just a blast to play.

I love the intrigue cards that not only benefit you, but ONE other opponent, I like the Lords cards, and I love the buildings. I think it's easy for someone to start running away with the lead early, and it can feel a little unbalanced, but this game is fun every time I play it. I love this game.

A nice clean, tidy, classic worker placement game.

A lot of people I know like it.

I personally can't be bothered with it. This is because the core goal (acquiring the right combinations of coloured cubes faster than your opponents) is only possible if you are constantly squinting around the table at tiny cards that show what combinations of cubes other players need to get at the time.

That ongoing math/eyestrain is dull, but the worker placement mechanisms are decent.

I prefer playing something like Caylus, which has similar mechanisms but without the bad bit and is slightly more cutthroat.

RATING: 5
In my view this is a good gateway worker placement game, but for my taste there is too little meat on the bones. Owning good buildings early in the game is pretty direct way to success. The hidden identities force you to play in a certain way (focusing on a ceratain kind of quest) without adding anything to gameplay. Those side quests played on another player (who has to solve this quest first) are a cheap attack the leader mechanism, which seams out of place in Euro game. In my two plays the theme did not really capture anybody (this is rather a flavored Euro and not a hybrid between thematic and Euro game). Lords of Waterdeep is just a completely generic worker placement game with nice components.

Perfect light worker placement game. Easy to teach and I think the theme will appeal to a lot of people.

UPDATE: Still a light worker placement game. I still enjoy playing it and it's accessible to new players. I am starting to be slightly bothered by the potential Kingmaker scenarios where players who have no hope of winning can potentially play mandatory quests on players in the lead on the last turn, just as they are about to finish a quest.

Played this recently.  Although somewhat fun, I found it to be a "Spreadsheet in a Box" euro game with a D&D theme tacked on.

I'll play it again if brought to the table, but own it myself?  Not on your life.

This game has a great mix of worker placement and resource management wrapped in an adventure game.  What really makes this game standout for me is the Waterdeep harbor.  Timing when to use this  or choosing to get what you want immediately is a key management aspect of this game.  It gives me the feeling like Pillars of the Earth when pulling master builders out of the bag when you need to decide whether to pay to use him now or put him in the back of the line.  This game might do it better.  The only thing that I have negative is the theme, although I'm glad it was there and it is interesting reading the flavor out loud, it just felt disconnected thematically.  I just didn'tgGet that story or adventure feel.  Overall, though it's just a great fun game.

RATING: 6
Fast and fluid gameplay makes it a rather enjoyable experience but there isn't anything really special here, on the other hand there isn't anything really bad either. Theme is glued on the surface, it's cubepushing in essence but overall a fairly nice game to bring new players into the hobby or just to play a quick worker placement game. 

After 7 plays the base game is just boring for experienced players.

RATING: 8.3
May '12: Picked it up a week or so ago.  Absolutely loving it!! Can't play it enough. I'm not into the theme much, but I still like to play by calling the cubes "fighters" "clerics" etc. rather than just "orange" "white" etc.  

Feb. '13: Picked up the DnDeeples last summer and they make the game better for sure.  Haven't played it as much lately after 19 plays in 2012.  Too many new games..........

This is the best-themed worker placement game I've played.  The theme marries up with the gameplay so well to give a super experience.  It hasn't quite obsoleted Agricola, but it's a better game.

It's got a nice, tight economy, too, and you're always wishing you had one more action.

I can play it with my two boys, 7 and 9, and get a lot out of it.  That's a huge bonus.

I'm having trouble getting too excited about this game. Players place their workers to gather resources which they then spend to acquire victory points. Its very familiar territory and though Waterdeep does it well it doesn't fit the theme (adventurers in a Dungeons & Dragons city) or add anything particularly radical.
If it has a strength it is that the game play is quite streamlined, you can learn almost all of the major effects in a single sitting.

RATING: N/A
+ Very streamlined worker placement game
+ Scales very well down to two players
+ Being able to use opponent's buildings is something I haven't seen in any other worker placement game
+ Adds in an extra method of blocking which can be effective if timed well (Mandatory Quests)
+ If you're an Ameritrash gamer trying to break into Euro then I would recommend this to you however Stone Age would be my more preferred gateway worker placement recommendation
+ Compared to Agricola for time, this game plays a lot faster

- Not as family friendly theme-wise as Stone Age and I might go as far to say maybe not as strategic even 
- Theme is not present, this is pushing cubes and order fulfillment with some D&D imagery pasted on
- Box is poorly designed and made
- Insert is equally poorly designed for vertical storage (I would toss the insert but the box is even flimsier without it)

My favorite worker placement game. Love the theme, it takes me back to the 80's D&D games when I was a kid. Lots of replayability as your character, the quests, and the buildings differ from game to game. The expansions are cool, adding tons of stuff, as well as increased interaction between players. The iOS implementation is exceedingly well done, with good AI, asynchronous multiplayer, and even local hotseat.

Nice and easy intro to worker placement games.  My only complaint is that the base game seems to be fairly one dimensional with all the hidden roles being very similar (exc. building guy) and there really being one path to victory (quest, quest, quest).  I've heard the expansion makes it a much better game so I'm looking forward to getting that.

EDIT - Expansion makes this an 8 I think

I SUPER enjoyed this game. A worker placement that is so simple and smooth. I cant tell you how satisfying it is to collect the right squad to send on quests. With only 8 rounds, I wasn't ready for the game to end (not that its a bad length), I just enjoyed it and wanted more. I'm not sure about adding either of the modules in the expansion. I feel like it might take away from the things I like about it.

RATING: 8
I'm a fan of worker placer games and this is a great example of one. 

I do like the D&D theme and the mechanics of the game are very solid. The rotation of the first player turn order by claiming it with a meeple is very good also! Components are all great and gameplay is relatively simple to understand once you've seen a single turn. 

Also, quite simply, great fun to play!

Slick worker placement game, easy to learn and play. 
My friend described this to me as 'Caylus light'.
Comes with very rich and developed D&D back story.

Wizards of the Coast have hit the nail right on the head with this one and this game scratches an itch that other similar games try but just cant seem to achieve.

Looking forward to any future expansion for this one.

Love this medium weight worker placement game. For our group it has just enough choices and random buildings to keep this game both interesting and close till the end.

6/2/12 Ok. After a few more plays with my group this game fits my game group and their tastes perfect. After four games the buildings have strove to make each game a unique experience. I have not rated a game a 10 for a while and this one suits that number. Each game has been close and everybody was in the game. Play and enjoy.

After still more plays this game shines. We have found it easy to teach new players which is a big plus. Even now that we all know the game each one is unique and interesting down to the end.

Based on one play I enjoyed but it moved slow.  We played with four and there was only rarely and on.y at the end of the game the opportunity to reassign simply because there were no actions to choose from.  I kept wondering if we had played something wrong.  I thought the themeing worked well.  Enjoyed much more on a second play.

If it's a worker placement/cubes-for-victory-points itch you're wanting to scratch, there are many better ways to achieve satisfaction, and even this Euro-loving player found the cube-pushing relentless. The fantasy theme, like excessive card-text, is always a turn-off for me in any case, and here it felt forced and irrelevant; a lot of time and effort presumably went into the art, theme and flavour text, which in our games were totally ignored.

I feel like I'm going through the motions of a good game but not actually playing it.  A little too much spite in the intrigue deck (especially minor quests, which are bad to draw and bad to be targeted by).  A little too much of "being dealt a strategy" rather than choosing your own strategy.  A little too much luck in whether or not your missions cards come out in the optimal order.  Still, a pleasing experience if nothing else.

RATING: 8
one of those games where i can't hardly believe my number of logged plays is so low! definitely a game about trying to balance your needs around those of others so that you don't get repeatedly blocked. there is "take-that" in the game, but it seems more geared towards inconveniencing a perceived run-away winner rather than making efficient use of resources during the game. Similar to Viticulture, Intrigue cards are often most useful in specific cases and also tend to help other players as well. i always used to wish the app was on Android, but now that it's here i never really bother. i really feel the draw of this game is in the social interaction around the table. sure, you can play serious and quiet, but even then it gives context to the blocks and counter-plays. i might get tired and move on from the game if i could get it to the table more often. until then, it's a fine worker placement game that i've played at both 2p and 5p with success. bottom line: Waterdeep is highly recommended for a reason. it's an accessible game that punches at least one notch above gateway to please a populous portion of the boardgame spectrum.

The base game of LoW is an excellent gateway game for new players. It is easy to learn and play but difficult to win against experienced players.

Fun quick worker placement game - basically Caylus-lite and more intuitive for new players. Scales very well from 2-5, probably better than any other worker placement game I've played. If everyone knows what they're doing, a 4p game can play easily in under an hour. Only minor complaint is that I wish there was more variety in the Lords, with combinations of bonus points for both # of buildings and a quest type, additional points for money or cubes at the end, # of completed quests, # of completed plot quests, etc.  I usually take Larissa out - she would be ok if there was more variety in the other Lords.  I also take out the mandatory quest intrigue cards - they don't provide any direct benefit to the player playing them, so they're just kind of kingmaker cards.

Played a couple of 4 player games so far and this is just a lot of fun. Is there some luck? Yep. Is there anything really new? Nope. Does it all work really well together, play very quickly, and does everyone have fun playing it? Absolutely. We knocked our second game of the evening out in an hour including setup and tear down. It's also not as scripted or static feeling as Caylus or some of the other heavier worker placement games. Good pick up. Oh and the insert is awesome.

It's best idea is a steal from Caylus (introduce a new worker-placement spot on the board, that belongs to you, but that others can use if they pay you a tax). I don't care for the take-that element: Mandatory Quest cards (just personal preference here). I'll always play without them in the deck if I can get the other players to agree.

I think the original theme was competing bakeries trying to corner the market on croissants in an obscure French town.  Hasbro opted to change it to a Dungeons & Dragons setting, which only required changing the image on the box cover and calling the purple cubes "wizards" instead of "blueberries".  If they hadn't put a pretty picture of Waterdeep underneath the locations on the board you'd have no idea what it was about, and frankly all the cubes piled in the middle of the board covered the pretty picture.  

This is a soulless game, though as Worker Placement goes you have enough options to make it playable without the usual WP frustrations.  Had it been a pastry theme it might have attracted a broader range of players and would have introduced a lot of places for comedic flair.  Fear not -- the opportunity to do that still exists and Hasbro might just re-release it that way to attract more attention.  As bland as the play is I'll recommend the following additional skins that could be viable:

 - Blimp factories in 1920s Germany.
 - Girl Scout cookie sales in a small, high strung, upper-middle-class suburban town.
 - Dark Age churches offering redemption options at bargain basement prices.
 - Quilt clatches fighting for space and attention at a convention, engaging in the kind of no-holds-barred to-the-death competition that only 75-year-old women that aren't afraid to die can bring.

Feel free to send me your own ideas; I'll post them to the list (with proper attribution of course.)

If this game wasn't so easy to teach and learn it wouldn't be nearly the hit that it is. The randomness makes the game forgiving to newer players and that works in this game's favor. Overall a solid package and one that I enjoy.

After several years of playing games, Lords of Waterdeep proves that it's sometimes better to make a game straightforward and accessible than it is to make it original and deep. I think this is exactly what I want from a light-to-middleweight Euro game these days. It's direct and intuitive, never getting caught in the weeds of engine-building and mindless activity. It's just as long, just as strategic, and just as interactive as it needs to be, and it never moves past that. There is great value in a game that knows what it's doing, and does it very well. One of my favorites of 2012.

I think this makes an amazing gateway game to worker placement.  It's definitely simple enough for newcomers to grasp, while also including some extras beyond the basics - I'm mainly thinking of the ability to build new buildings which serve as new worker slots - that demonstrate the potential of the mechanic.  What makes it an amazing gateway game is that experienced players probably won't mind at all having to bring this out again and again for each new introduction, because it's a solid enough game to be enjoyable after repeated plays.

Slightly related to "Ankh-Morpork" and slightly better. Classic worker placement lacking of theme. I mean: these wooden cubes are what exactly? Just requirements to complete quests. Overall a fun game that worked very well with 3 players and showed an astonishing short duration.

RATING: 5.5
It's a too-simplistic worker placement game with a "theme" that is vaguely and lazily applied to mechanisms borrowed from better games in what I'm convinced is Lee and Thompson's cruel experiment on D&D fans. I don't know if the fact that they designed this really speaks to some Great New Dawn of hybridized board gaming, or if it just goes to show how easily a few Euro mechanisms can be pulled from the shelf, dusted off, painted with bright fantasy colors, and tossed together to make a game.. It isn't broken or badly designed - it's just such a proud non-entity (which is nevertheless in my collection as it has bewitched many of my comrades into believing it somehow rises above other Euro games) that I find it infuriating on principle. And I am ashamed to say that I have good fun when I play it...

RATING: 8
Update: Rating lowered after a second 2 player game. The game seems to scale well, as you get more actions with less players and each building can only hold 1 "worker", so you are still blocked in your actions as if there were more players. But this game is so simplistic its sickening. Obvious choices combined with 5th grade level gameplay = boring. Wizards of the Coast are slapping Eurogamers in the face with this game. "Let's make a euro game! Generic cubes and meaningless gameplay, that's what those cube-pushers like, right?". Avoid at all costs.

Rating after one play. 

Lords of Waterdeep is your basic worker movement game. It is easy to explain, easy to get started, and easy to play. 

Each player is dealt a "Lord" in the beginning of the game that guides each player's strategy, to some extent, by giving bonus points for completing certain kinds of quests. I only looked at this card once, then kept it face down under my player mat...er...I mean my "Tavern". While I like having a secret goal to go for, thematically it did nothing for me. I don't even know which Lord I was. 

For the first 4 turns each player has 2 actions, and 3 actions for the remaining 4 turns, which consists of placing a very thematical meeple pawn on one of the buildings on the map. Buildings do very simple actions like "Take 2 Orange Cubes" (Warriors), "Take 1 White Cube" (Cleric), "Play 1 Intrigue Card", or "Take 1 Quest Card". After you take an action you have the option of completing a Quest, which you have face up beside your Tavern. Completing a Quest is a simple as discarding whatever it is the Quest card calls for, such as 4 orange cubes and 4 gold, or 6 purple cubes (Magicians). Quests give you points and possibly cubes and/or money. The usual stuff. Quests also have 1 of 5 categories which your Lord will give you extra points for at the end of the game for completing. I guess what you need to discard is connected to what kind of Quest it is, i.e discard warriors for a combat quest. Didn't really matter or grab me in any way though.

Also the map sucks.

I would play it again though, if with non-gamers or girlfriends or whatnot, but if anything else is available...yeah, no.

It's fun to play, in large part because of high production quality, but I failed to see real strategy in it. You pick up quests that suit your lord and then collect required resources, from time to time blocking other players if possible. Stone Age level, no more.

RATING: 6
I like D&D, but the more 'Wonderful World of Dungeons and Dragons' the theming gets, the more my toes curl. Waterdeep really takes the biscuit in that regard. This game would be so much more tolerable with even just a generic fantasy theming, if a more interesting theme or background couldn't be found. 

Anyhow, as a WP euro, its OK - it clearly rewards players who know the cards better (as do plenty of games, but there's something that feels very arbitrary about that here), but it's OK. I think in general, if I am going to play a Euro, I want it to be a really good euro, or else really quick. 

Impressive but weird production values. The success does kind of surprise me, but it is well-earned for the effort that has gone into this.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After my first play I was a bit underwhelmed. The theme is really really pasted on, I can't imagine anyone feeling like sending out adventurers instead of just gaining some colored cubes. There was very little interaction between players. Meh. On my second play, however, things went a little better, so I raised my rating from 5 to 7. Maybe we had a few more interactive intrigues, maybe the players were more fun or in a better mood, I don't know. Or maybe it was because this time around we had tiny meeples instead of cubes to push around (my friend's game had been "pimped" in the meantime). 

I still prefer Sons of Anarchy for my worker-placement fix, since the theme is much stronger, as is the player interaction (added battles and negotiation). And I don't even like the show, and this is probably also something that pushes most people away from the game. I almost never get it to the table (some don't like "games with photos", some aren't interested in the show, some may find it too violent). 

Lords of Waterdeep is at least a nice enough worker-placement game that my friends are actually willing to play.

A very smooth worker placement game where options expand greatly throughout the eight rounds of the game. Everything is very easy to follow and explain and the flavour is provided through the artwork and presentation.

The gameplay however could be be perceived as a rather soulless cube accumulation and cube currency game. How strong your perception of this might be will depend on the distribution of the buildings. Cube generation buildings are rather dull if too many come out, especially early in the game. The buildings that make the game interesting are the ones that allow you to perform interesting actions, like copy the action of an opponent's agent, or trade two cubes for any three. I'd have liked to see more of such buildings in the game rather than run the risk that the game is swamped with cube generation buildings. Buildings that alter the rules I find to be far more interesting.

Quests also provide some variation, but not enough. There are different classes you might be aiming for (to achieve a victory point end of game bonus), but it's the ones that provide a permanent effect that are the more interesting. There's not enough of these and their permanent effects are not interesting enough. To keep the game simple and smooth flowing  you wouldn't want them all to have permanent effects, but again, ones that change the rules or give your opponents a bonus are more interesting than straight out cube and coin swaps for victory points.

Intrigue cards provide an extra layer of player interaction. They are nicely weighted in that they don't hit your opponents so much that they destroy their game. Yes, mandatory quests can really mess another player if played right near the end of the game, but this is the right level of interaction as players should make contingency plans expecting to be messed with. (I enjoy a drop or two of player added chaos, but this might not be to everyones taste.) I'd have liked to see more variation and no card duplicates. They're a nice gamble element when deciding if you want to pick one up over something else. The method in which they're played being limited and giving that agent a second use afterwards is very elegant.

A fine effort that could be played with gamers and non gamers alike. Simple rules (don't let the size of the rulebook fool you), reasonably quick playing time, good interaction, nice bits. Rather engrossing and enjoyable, but could have been tweaked to make it into less of a cube pusher for victory points game.

Worker placement in its most basic form. The typical Euro of getting cubes and money to exchange for victory points. Direct, simple and with no pretensions; these are the elements, together with the great background, that makes this game a nice one. To say something bad, the cubes kill the theme. It would be nice to have miniatures instead.

RATING: 7.75
Excellent light-medium worker placement game.  The variable "Lord of Waterdeep" end game scoring was interesting without being all important. You definitely don't need to have intimate knowledge of various cards to win.  And while I love Agricola's mechanism of adding more workers for more actions, I appreciate this game's (relatively) fixed number of workers throughout the game.  An excellent game all around, with interesting choices that can be played with any group.

5/16/12 - while the game scales very well from 2-5 players, I find that I enjoy the 4 or 5 player version better as it makes the game tighter and seems to force a little more use of other's buildings.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I felt this game lacked any kind of excitement. You were dealt your lord and your quests and you just worked toward completing them. The mandatory quests are a nice touch, but if a player gets hit with two of them, they're likely not winning the game. Downtime wasn't too bad with 5, but I wasn't interested in the other players moves, I knew what I had to do so I did the best I could on my turn. Pretty boring game.

Most of my experience comes from lower player counts, at which this game does not shine.  I love worker placement, but the actions and theme in this aren't particularly exciting.  Cubes, cubez, quebzzzz.  A little too much luck with lord cards and intrigue cards.  Very well made for what it is though, and the corruption mechanism in the expansion adds much needed interest.  Good introductory game, but not one I tend to pull out often.

Plays well with two.

The wife and I both really enjoyed this one. She even asked me to play again the next day, and that almost never happens. I always initiate game time.

This is the only worker placement game we own, and the theme helps. It also helps that the theme is light enough that it can be ignored at first and added in more heavily as we get more used to the game.

This could definitely be a gateway towards more fantasy games.

Purchased at May '12 Atlanta Game Fest. Players organize D&D-like adventures by finding quests at the Cliffwatch Inn, recruiting rogues, fighters, wizards and clerics from various locations in Waterdeep, and completing your quests for victory points. This is a short and fast worker-placement game. Theoretically this game should be playable in under an hour but I haven't seen it yet. It's not a terribly deep game, but there's some good variety to opportunities. These opportunities include acquiring/playing intrigue cards and constructing/using buildings (which are extra locations for people to place workers). Several nice mechanics here, although, as I've said, it's not terribly deep.

One thing I don't like from based on 2 consecutive plays:  Lord Card: Larissa Neathal. Both plays won w/ that card buy a huge margin - not fair so I exclude that card as my house rule.  All in all, great theme, very organized layout and design. I hope they have an expansion soon.  Awesome for 2 players as well.

Fácil y rápido de explicar, este juego de gestión de recursos me ha funcionado increíblemente bien con gente no muy jugona. Es muy variable en cuanto a rejugabilidad, las cartas de intriga y aventura, y sobre todo los edificios que vayan saliendo, van a marcar el devenir de la partida.
Sin ser un pro o un contra, la temática es es completamente circunstancial, y pronto ves sólo cubitos y cartas, el lugar de aventureros y proezas. Eso es bueno en mi caso, ya que no "ahuyenta" a aquellos jugadores de corte familiar con un tema demasiado "friki".
Entre los contras, lo veo un poco caótico con 4-5 jugadores, sólo dos acciones en los primeros turnos y un tablero que ha podido cambiar totalmente hasta que te vuelve a tocar, impiden hacer una estrategia muy a largo plazo.

Even better with Skullport expansion! The corruption resource and how you both use it to further your agenda while also keeping it in check and managing it to minimize its impact on your end game score really adds an interesting twist to the base game.

I can't believe I'm going to say this about a WotC title, but I enjoyed it.  It's light enough to get non-gamers into it and there are good choices to be made for more experienced gamers.  The theme doesn't come across as strongly as it could - often, we'd forget that those were actually supposed to be adventurers, but they could have been goods used to fulfill contracts.  They did a good job.  The art is wonderful.  The mandatory quests might be a bit over-powered, especially if you get stuck with a couple and others don't get any, but it's still an enjoyable experience.  I wish there was more incentive to build buildings, but it was a good time.

Upgrading this to an "8" after my fourth play.  This is a great, simple game that shines with 3-5 players.  It can be explained in 10 min, and is thematic enough to give players a sense of purpose in the game.  The variety in buildings is great, making every game slightly different.  Looking forward to buying/incorporating the expansion.

This, like Fresco, is one of my current go-to gateway games.  I'll pick Fresco if there are more women in the group, Lords if there are more men.

Boosting to an 8.5.  Every time I play it, I like it more and more.  It's so simple, yet so entertaining and it's NEVER failed me on game night.  People love it.  The only downside is that 5 player games can take a long time.

8-20-17:
Downgrading back to 8.  While people always seem to enjoy this game, there's so little "strategy" to it, and the winner in some ways might as well be randomly determined.

RATING: 9
This game is a ton of fun. It has really great Euro mechanics and a great theme. I also love the way the board looks.

The game really shines when the Scoundrels of Skullport expansion is added. It adds new layers of strategy that will leave you talking about the game long after you've put it away. Highly recommended!

Lords of Waterdeep -- Played three- and four-player.

Four-player felt too hurried to really accomplish much.  (Only two workers per turn for the first half, then three.)

Three-player was more satisfying.  (Three workers per turn for the first half, then four.)

At three, this rates [u]very[/u] high on my list of worker placement games.  I'm hoping an expansion will improve the game with more players.

It's Ticket to Ride of worker placement genre. Easy, accessible, varied and with a little splash of theme that makes all the difference, even if it's as thin as it is. Atmosphere kinda works (not in the immersive way, but in "it's neat" way. What makes the game and what LoW brings to the WP genre is huge variety for such a light game. Tons of quests, intrigue cards and a lot of special buildings means that this game is as much of a ride as possible while being a WP (there's little optimisation and understanding of the system, as there's no system, nor actual engines). It definitely succeeds in what it wants to achieve and I'll see if it has any staying power with me (not fond of WP genre). The game is way way better for a family type game than Stone Age - better theme, more ride, less thinky.  

Graphic design is top - evocative and functional. Though I wish icons on quest cards would be easier to see across the table. 

Second game: Now I've won, but. The game took forever and shown problems of WP games - they are linear. You need to do A to do B to achieve C. Of course you also need 3 other plans if the first one wont go through. So you put an AP person somewhere in this chain and it will be a pain. This one needs a group that takes this a light, simple game, not a challenging one. 

EDIT: I think I started with this game around 7.0 rating and now it's way way down. I still think this game is as good as I thought initially. One of best worker placement, the most accessible one, for sure. I just am fed up with tolerating this genre. It's incredibly dumb and boring.

Theme adds nice to the game color, but nothing at all to the game play. It's a worker placement / set collection / mission fulfillment game, and it's good.

However, it's easy to gang up on a player and completely screw him, which is frustrating. The attacks are just too powerful. These can be mitigated by a) allowing "forced" missions to be completed together with real ones, and b) opening a resource market that allows people to buy cubes that they're missing. Or just take out the forced missions; seems to solve the problem, which is what I did and I'm perfectly happy about it.

據說是凱呂斯簡化版後的遊戲，是個相當不錯的工人擺放遊戲。雖然套入D&D的背景，但其實在遊玩的時候沒什麼代入感，不過遊戲機制本身就能讓人很容易投入遊戲中，對初學者來說第一場就能上手更是其優點！

I am not a D&D player, so I know very little about it, but this game is extremely enjoyable. Top of the line components, a fantastic storage system in the box, and more importantly, very thought provoking and intriguing gameplay. Simple enough to learn in 10 minutes, it is a fantastic game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played 2 5P games and 1 4P game. Lord of Waterdeep doesn't really do anything ground-breaking that other light worker placement games haven't covered before. However, it's still a good game with a decent amount of player interaction and a clever concept of advanced buildings, which creates more areas on the board where players can go to. When it comes to balanced targeted negative player interaction in Euros, Mandatory Quests are the way to go.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The lords aren't distinct enough for me, and there's a lot of luck if you just happen to be the first player early and  a great building become available for you to build at the right time, it pays dividends throughout the game. 

I just think Stone Age is a much better Worker Placement game than LoW.

This is about as vanilla as you can get when it comes to worker placement.  Place an agent, take that action.  There are intrigue and quest cards that add some variety to the game but the hidden lords in the base game are obvious and bland.  Having said that, this game is so easy to learn as a next step game and is enjoyable for a both a budding gamer as well as an experienced one that I simply love it.

For some reason, I just don't ever feel like I'm doing well in this game.  The execution of the theme isn't my favorite either.  The best part is the Owlbear mission.
Edit: After revisiting, I found this surprisingly refreshing.  The worker placement is pretty balanced, and though I love Caverna, it's nice to play a worker placement game where you don't have to spend 2 minutes after each round doing upkeep/board maintenance.

#36 on my Top 100 Games of All Time (2015)

This game is fun, easy to understand, and plays in about an hour. I've heard many people refer to this game as a "Caylus-Lite", and I would agree. They have extremely similar mechanics. This one doesn't have the same strategic depth, but is more forgiving of new players and more fun, IMO.
It's suppose to have a D&D theme, but that just feels pasted on to me. I usually just refer to the cubes by their color and not their character, but it's the mechanics that draw me into a game, not the theme. If theme is your thing, you could probably get into this game even more.

This is a fairly basic, straight-forward worker placement game: place worker, get resources, convert resources to points; break the rules from time to time with special cards.  That's about it.  There is nothing new or novel here, but it's a good introductory worker-placement game.  The theme may appeal to some, but it's not really well-applied within the game.  I'll play this game when it comes up in the rotation, but there are so many other worker-placement games that I'd rather play...

A very fun very quick worker placement game.  The game balances enough tension for the best position but never leaves a player without an option to place where he/she can gain some benefit.  A game that brings fun forward and easy enough to introduce new players to worker placement and also a nice way to finish a heavy gaming session where there is enough time for a non filler game but you don't want something real heavy.  Add in the D&Deeples and the theme takes effect as people stop referring to things as cubes and say wizard, rogue, fighter, and cleric.  This game verges on great.

Nagy fellángolás övezi a játékot a BGG-n. Eurogame-t csomagoltak szerepjátékos, tematikus külsőbe a tervezők. Ennek ellenére többünk szerint semmi nem jön át játék közben a témából. A játék sima Caylus könnyített verzió. Munkásainkat helyezzük le a tábla előre kialakított helyeire, illetve az időközben megépített épületekre. Ezeken különböző hősöket bérelhetünk fel, akik küldetések teljesítére teremtettek. A végén, aki a küldetésekből a legtöbb pontot szerezte az nyer. Újításnak gondolom az intrika kártyák szerepét. Van egy olyan hely, ahol ilyen kártyákat lehet kijátszani, majd az ide rakott munkást a kör végén újra le lehet rakni még szabad helyre. Ezek a kártyák általában valami pozitívak, illetve az ellenfelek akadályozására használatosak. Ennyi konfliktus még pont belefér szerintem, bár magas játékosszámnál egy-egy ilyen kártya nagyon keresztbe tehet adott játékosnak. A játék pozitívumai: könnyed, gyors, játékosszámmal változó játékmenet. A kivitel nem csúnya, de a tábla szerintem puritán. A doboz kívülről mutatós, belülről viszont nagyon gyengére sikerült a szortírozó rész. Nehezen férnek be az elemek rendesen.
A játék szinte semmi újat nem mutat, de tényleg jól összerakták.

[2014-04-05]
Harmadikat játszva egyre jobban tetszik a játék, tényleg semmi extra, de jól működő könnyed játékról van szó. Pont a Coal Baron volt még emellett a másik játék, ami ebből a szempontból nagyon hasonló. Időben, nehézségben, mégis számomra ez sokkal jobb élményt ad.

This one is fun. It's a worker-placement Euro, but the D&D theme makes it feel like I'm 18 again, throwing dice all night long (without the sleep deprivation that comes with throwing dice all night long). Some people say the theme is pasted on, but I'm starting to take issue with that complaint when it comes to worker-placement games. Just about any theme is a valid choice, when placing workers who subsequently do something for you is concerned. In this game, it's building parties to complete quests. I think it works well!

All style and no substance. Takes mechanics from much better games and melds them together into a sword-wielding, brain-dead, luckfest of an abomination. Too few meaningful decisions to be called a euro, and too dull to be Ameritrash. It's a horrible, horrible game.

The amount of stuff in this game can be a bit overwhelming at first, but it's a quite easy worker placement game with plenty of options and strategies for accruing a winning number of points. 

The mechanics work, regardless of thematic considerations and the game has been popular with people who have no idea what Waterdeep is, or anything about the lore.  

Certainly best around the 3-4 range, but perfectly serviceable at 2, and for some extra time at 5.

Its a good worker placement game but the whole fun part to me is building different structures and giving new unique actions and that is not really the theme of the game.

On the surface, Lords of Waterdeep looks like a sprawling RPG-esque board game. In reality, it is quite a basic worker-placement game that doesn't fully utilize its theme. However, I still think this is one of the best introductory "Euro-style" board games on the market. It's quite simple to understand and the theme doesn't get in the way of those that might find the game too "nerdy." The production is basic, but good (especially the insert) and overall it's just a great game. It's unfortunate that Wizards doesn't have as much faith in it as I do.

Played this once and loved the feeling while playing it.  The game itself is not that deep (How much more Euro than collecting and spending tiny cubes of colour) - but the theme seems to bring it to life.  The various options available on the board for the most part felt like they would all give you some real benefit but there was always a question of what your overall strategy was and how that would influence your decision based on which actions were in your best interest.  Trust me - it was much more engaging than my description !

My favourite worker placement game unless Blood Rage counts as worker placement, the theme probably helps. 

Easy to teach to others but plenty of differing strategies can be employed.

I'm not a big fan of worker placement games, and this one didn't change my mind. There is still not enough interaction, and its all about exchanging those cubes for VPs like in so many other games (we played with the small DnDeeples, but we still kept referring to them as the purple, white, black and orange thingies/cubes).   That is not FUN!

That being said, the game is still on my wishlist, because it's short, light, and maybe the best game for introducing new players to WP games.

I've only played this a couple times and I feel I'm probably not giving it a fair shake. One thing that bugs me is the little cubes for fighters, wizards, etc. I'd like it a lot more with special meeples. Of course, that costs money. So I'd have to buy the game AND the meeples to see if I liked it enough more that way. There's a gamble for ya!

Family favorite. Some known combinations are automatic wins, but the game is balanced enough for you to be able to win no matter your goals or methods, as long as you manage your resources well. Occasionally, the combination of poor luck of the draw for buildings, quests, and intrigue cards simultaneously will cause significant stagnation in a game, and correspondingly low scores.

A tidy, taut, confusion-free worker placement game.  Not too challenging, but still a fun experience.  I especially like the graphic design and artwork, which is very clean and elegant.  Very nice components.   People will balk at the thin cards but I don't have a problem with them.  The game comes with a nicely designed insert that actually accommodates the game's components in a highly organized fashion.  All in all, I am impressed with this production.  Repeated plays have inspired me to increase my personal rating from a 7 to 8.

D&D-themed Euro game.  I like Lords of Waterdeep - it has this sense of elegant simplicity about it.  Place meeples, obtain cubes, get victory points.  There's not really any major economic engine to master, but some might consider that a plus.  Good intro into a more thinky type of game.

RATING: 9
This is a great worker placement game set in the D&D world.  The components are top notch - the box is designed to hold everything very well.

While it seems pretty lightweight at first there are some subtle strategies that definitely increase your chances of winning - like knowing when to play intrigue cards versus buying a building versus just gathering adventurers to complete a quest.

All in all, a game with a fair amount of replay value.  Lots of fun for 2 to 4 people - not one I'd recommend for 5 though as it can quickly get frustrating with 5.

I kind of regret this purchase. The game didn't capture me as I was hoping it would. It's not even a good intro to my non-Euro playing friends, since they're either 1)already geeks and could be convinced to play something excellent like Agricola or 2) aren't geeks at all and wouldn't want to play this because of the theme.

A great worker placement gateway, but it's not nearly as clever and interesting as it could be. 

The secret player roles don't add anything, because they're all just the same "collect these two types of quest" (except the builder character, which is obvious to everyone by Turn 2), when they could have offered differential powers and meaningful specialized goals that meaningfully affected gameplay. The faction backstories have nothing to do with anything, but they could have offered rivalries and the pursuit of goals the other players sought to oppose. Once you "claim" a quest, nobody else can send an adventuring party on it, which thematically makes zero sense, and misses opportunities for my adventuring party to try to beat up your adventuring party. Quests trigger instantly and automatically when the right combination of cubes is assembled, but those cubes are then lost and few if any lasting effects come about, but there could have been a mechanism to resolve the degree of success or failure on a quest, or a way for "your" hired adventurers to gain experience and become more powerful, or for this quest to give you artefacts or clues that unlocked the next quest or gave your adventurers better abilities. There's no arc or narrative, in a game that pretends to be meaningfully linked to a D&D campaign world with 30 years of backstory. 

Overall, Waterdeep is not as good as Stone Age, which is a real shame, because it could so easily have been so much more.

There's certainly nothing new here. It's a generic worker placement game, of which the world probably didn't need yet another. Still, for an introduction to the genre, it's okay. The first game I played took two hours, roughly double what it should have taken. Decisions aren't that difficult. Played quickly and in the right spirit, however, I can see the attraction for a certain audience. My biggest complaint is the mandatory quests, which are both random and arbitrary, and possibly decisive, a bad mix. 

Now that I've played twice, my second play confirms my first.  The mandatory quests are an awful design choice.

Played it and didn't care for it. Randomness is good in games so long as it plays a purpose (usually to keep the game fresh and ensure no "guaranteed" strategy ever arises). It feels like the randomness in the game just overwhelms the impact of player choice. Your lord of waterdeep is random, your building selection is random, your quest availability is random. You get nailed with "take that" cards, the worst of which are the mandatory quests. These can serve to further disadvantage players attempting to catch up to a leader. The game also scales VERY poorly to more players, as the supply of cube-generators only increases insoumch as players buy more of the random buildings. 

I was concerned that perhaps my playthrough was not representative of the game in general, but was informed promptly by fans of the game that it wasn't that unusual and that the game simply wasn't for me. So I suppose if you like choosing specific people to screw over Ameritrash-style, games that don't scale well at all to the number of people playing, the ability for runaway winners to sabotage people attempting to keep up, and too much randomness to meaningfully interact with, this is the game for you. Otherwise, if you wanted a good worker placement/role selection game, I'd point you to Agricola or Puerto Rico or countless other fun games that do it better.

Won Doron by a landslide (over 200 pts). Main drivers where the two plot quests - get extra warrior for every action that gets you a warrior, and the one that gives 2pts for every X type quest.
 

After first game:

Had a great game with Guy, Nir, Hila and Doron. A 5 player game that was tense and interesting.

Most of the scores where 120-140 which is outstanding and surprising for a 5 player game.

1 play, 3er

A nice, simple worker placement game with a very very pasted on D&D theme. Nothing new here, but it takes a few mechanisms from some games and puts them together into a solid, quick-playing game!

You are apparently using your henchmen to build and use various town buildings in order to put together parties of fighters, wizards, clerics, and thieves to send on quests which earn you glory or reputation. Or something like that, anyway. Really, you're placing workers in various locations, most of which give you cubes or cards. You spend various cube combinations to complete mission cards, earning you VP (and/or money or some other special bonus). 

Despite the lack of theme, though, the game works quite well. It's not as deep as many other worker placement games, and those mandatory quests are pretty darn annoying, but the game was still a lot of fun to play!

--- Summary ---
- 9 rounds per game. Players start with x workers (varies with player number), and get 1 more at turn 5. Also, each player gets one end-game bonus card (bonus VP for specific in-game actions, e.g. building a bunch of buildings, or completing quests of a specific type, etc.)
- there are 3 available buildings on display in the builder's area
- the board has several predetermined locations where you can:
... get some combination of: cubes (white, black, orange, or purple); quest cards (complete for VP/other rewards); intrigue cards (action cards, various effects on you and other players); money
... build one of the buildings: place it on the board with your ownership marker; it becomes a new location where workers may be placed (building owner earns a small bonus when another player uses the building); immediately add a new building to the builder's area
... become first player next round (turns then go clockwise)
... play an intrigue card

Game flow:
- at the start of each turn, add a VP chit to each building in the builder's area 
- in turn order, place a single worker on a location (pre-printed, or a built building) and immediately take that action; after each action, may complete ONE quest
- after players have taken all their actions, the workers in the 3 intrigue spots move their worker, in the order placed, to a new location and take that action

Most VP after 9 rounds, including end-game bonus cards, wins!

Fantastic introduction to worker placement style games, and a great game in its own right.  I love that it can be taught/learned in about 5 minutes, and that games generally take less than one hour.

So what that the theme is pasted on?  It's excellent.

My only complaint is that the Mandatory Quest cards feel utterly unbalanced with the rest of the Intrigue cards.  I remove them from play at this point.

Tentative rating based upon one play, although I don't see it changing more than one point either way.  Seems somewhat derivative of Caylus, but I always enjoyed that game.

RATING: 9
My next favorite worker placement game behind Agricola.  It has a lot going for it.  Different quest, Intrigue card, and building effects to give the game variety.  Perfect length to give the game a sense of urgency.  And a great theme to boot (albeit kinda "pasted on").  It doesn't have the variety and depth that Agricola does but this is still a great game and it is the perfect introduction into the worker placement genre for less experienced players.

I do have a problem with some of the balance of the game though.  Despite what anybody tells you the builder lord (who gives you +6 VP for every building at game end) is overpowered.  I also wonder about the pricing of some of the buildings.  Aside from that this is a well-made thematic game.

Lots of quests going on over and over. The theme is not present at all but that is not a bad thing if you couldn't care less about D&D like I do. Nothing wrong here, in a way. The main issue I have is the way buildings work because they are very powerfull when used for the first time and usually that happens NOT to the player who builds it but to the next player in player order. Something I really, really hate.
The repetitive ammount of the same type of action (place a man, get cubes, complete quests) is boring.
I can play it again but only if the right mood for that.

A worker placement game wearing a dungeons and dragons coat: the perfect game for my husband, the D&D Player, and me, the Euro Gamer (btw, he likes Euros, too, which helps). Played with two this was fun, the theme is not very immerse but gives the game a great look. As far as worker placement goes you can go a lot more complex, this is more medium weight and maybe therefor so enjoyable, and since we haven't owned a WP game so far (which is a real shame) this a perfect add-on to our collection. I am curious to see how the dynamics change with different player numbers since you will have fewer agents to deploy while playing the same number of rounds. My hunch right now is that the max of 5 might be pushing it...
Played now with 3 and I have even more doubts it would be good with 5. Additionally, I have to say while I like the game it is lacking a little something to make it truly great, it lost a star point from after the last gaming session and is down to 6.5 now (which is still decent).

Too much variability and hidden information.

I just absolutely love this game.  Game is designed for 2 to 5 players.  I'd say 3 is the number to hit for a meh time, 4 is better and 5 is great.  

Worker placement to gather resources.  Quests to complete and Intrigue cards to help you out or mess with other players.  And what Lord you have can determine what you might want to do.  

I find the play of the Intrigue cards to be one of the best aspects.  And with 5 people you can keep them going.  I have played with the expansions and they are both great to have, though I don't have them.

The snobby gamer in my wants to rate this a 6 but I can’t do it.  It is too dam fun.

Initial rating an 8 after 1 play.  I think this rating may go up with more plays - we'll see :)  Indeed this did - to a 9!  Four games strong, though I'd say it's not my favourite game of all time.  

The best part of this game is how easy it is to teach.  A new player should be able to start playing intelligently by turn 4-5.  As well, this seems to appeal to my slightly non-gamer friends too.

I like that this is set within established Dungeons and Dragons mythology, but with entirely separate game play. I haven't yet decided how much the luck of the draw affects game play, but it seems significant. I challenge the Stone Age comparisons; it is not that similar and it is not better. 

It's a much better game with the skulls expansion.

A basic worker placement that just about anyone could pick up and have fun with.  Every game I've played has been down to the wire with just enough hidden points to make it interesting but not so much you have no idea when the winner comes back from last place.  It tends to lack meaningful decision making.

RATING: 3
Just because you paste on a bunch of Dungeons and Dragons pictures onto a game does not make it thematic.  The game has about as much theme as grocery shopping ("I need four purples, two whites and an orange - okay now I just killed the beholder".)  Woo hoo.  This game is as dull as dirt and is another one that completely baffles me as to why people speak so highly of it.  Boring, boring boring.

EDIT- I was hoping that the expansion would add something to the game that would help me to like it, even a little, but it didn't.  This game is just plain awful
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A good entry level worker placement. The theme is great as long as people are reading the text and you must make sure to call the cubes what they represent instead of their color. This is not a must have for me because my collection has several, more interesting, worker placement games. I would also need to get this with the D&D meeples so it would cost more. 

I got this in a MT and was able to play with my 8 and 10 year old girls. I was impressed with how well they were able to pick it up. They enjoyed it. I do not as much now that I have had a few more plays. The randomness of and limited quests determines the outcome of the game more than the players' choices. I think Coal Barron is a better worker placement game for this weight.

A great Euro-style game with a nice coat of D&D paint that is really just for thematic purposes. So even if you aren't a fan of D&D give this a shot, it doesn't force the fantasy genre down your throat or anything, but if you like fantasy, there's plenty to like here as well.

RATING: 5
The one thing that struck me the most is that the theme, for something as rich in flavor as D&D is, is really just tacked on. Normally I wouldn't give two shits, but there seemed to be wasted opportunities there.

That being said, it was enjoyable. For some reason, a 5 player game didn't seem that cutthroat, but I also had the advantage of that one quest that let you double up on a square, so I didn't really care if people "blocked" me, and it was everyone's first game, so the passive aggressive blocking inherent to such games wasn't really part of anyone's strategy. I think there's also the case where everyone has certain biases as a result of their Lord, so the guy who wants Warfare and Commerce quests probably won't rub up against the guy who wants Arcana and Skullduggery quests or whatever. As a result I noticed that people were biasing pretty heavily towards a certain type of quest and thus the resources for that, especially if they got an early quest that gave them more VPs for that kind of quest, so there's overall less competition for certain resources. I, for instance, got Khelben Blackstaff, who favors Warfare and Arcana quests, and as a result, very rarely needed money or clerics. I would need such resources on occasion, but for the most part, it was mostly a non-concern for me if someone else took the building before me.

A first play in the shop today went very smoothly, the rules are clear and the components excellent, everything fits beautifully into the box, which was appreciated.

This was "ok."  The theme is pretty shallow, and with two players it just felt too easy to do everything we wanted (even after playing various attack-y Intrigue cards).  If we had started with this game instead of Agricola ACBaS it might have been better, but as it is we didn't feel like this game provided us with many interesting decisions/choices.  Overall, it was an OK way to pass some time, but neither of us wants to play it again.
Traded it away.

RATING: 6
As worker placement games go, this one is fairly light, and it rarely felt like resources were so tight that I needed to go on exact spaces in order to achieve my ends.  This resulted in very little player blocking, which, depending on what your gameplay style is, could be a positive.  This is what I would consider a gateway game, and although the theme is somewhat pasted on, the additional flavor text on the cards definitely adds to the feel of the game.  However, I would have liked to see more variation in the objectives of the Lords.  That being said, as there are limited numbers of things that can be achieved, I don't see any way of providing more variability in objectives.

A solid 7.  My wife prefers Stone Age as a worker placement game, partly due to a lack of interest in the D&D theme, and partly due to the amount of text on the cards - the Quest cards can be hard to see from the other side of the board.  Kitted out with DnDeeples!

RATING: 8
This game is nearly as good as the hype.  There is a bit too much luck which cannot be mitigated to score higher than an 7 with us, but the brilliantly tight theme knocks it a full point upward to a solid 8.  Just make sure you call the cubes by their class name and not just "orange," "black," etc.  As such this is the first truly crossover game I've seen that bridges Ameritrash, RPG and Euro.  The components are pretty good, but the one thing it's lacking which would truly bring it up to an 8.5 is miniatures--if the game had included small 10mm scale figures of each class, rather than euro-cubes, the overall feel of gameplay would actually further improve.

the fundamental gameplay is worker placement, with a goal to run a changing "engine" based on quest cards.  There's a bit of take-that involved in the Intrigue cards (which also will work to slow a leader, and they are easy for the other players to work thusly since it does not slow their quest-development much at all).

RATING: 5
This game tries to bring both the Euro and Ameritrash paradigm to the table. The result is a highly interactive worker placement game that fills a niche.

Unfortunately, it is really not my cup of tea. No manner how well you planned your turn/game anybody can come in and break your plan. When it's your turn to stop/help an opponent, it's very to gauge who's leading/trailing without reading everybody's tinny printed active and plot quest that I would basically just pick someone at random. Add to that turns that only gets longer as the game progress and a useless bugged last turn and you have me quite turned off.

This would need to be a lot shorter for me to work. Take that mechanic and strategy don't mix too well over long play time.

Take a generic worker placement game, throw on a generic fantasy theme, and you've got a BGG Top 30 game - go figure!  It's an okay game and I don't mind playing it, but it certainly doesn't excite me in any way.  Replacing the cubes with those genius little DnDeeples does help the theme to "pop" quite a bit, and I suppose if you were to take the time to look closely at the quest titles and flavour text that might help with the immersion too, but the game play itself feels pretty uninspired.  But perhaps the expansion helps to ratchet up the excitement?  Game design: 2/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 4.5/10

RATING: 6
A good effort from a publisher not known for games of this sort. Dungeons and Dragons... worker-placement?!

Unfortunately, there is nothing original here, and nothing to set it apart from other resource-conversion euros except for unnecessary randomness and direct screwage -- its nominal theme is so poorly reflected in the mechanisms that it might as well be about fulfilling orders for bouquets composed of different colours of flower cube. The saddest thing is actually that it's [i]so[/i] generic a euro: it would have been more interesting had the buildings and cards been wildly different, but most of them are different flavours of tedious cube acquisition and conversion.

There is more luck involved than many worker placement games; having the right quests turn up at the right time can be extremely advantageous. The intrigue cards, which provide opportunities for one-off bonuses and direct attacks on other players, are likewise not created equal: you will feel cheated when you waste an action to collect a bad one.

Don't get me wrong: it's a good game. It's not particularly original or particularly interesting, but it plays quickly, flows very well, and the buildings and quests add variety. It is easy to both learn and teach. If for some reason I had to choose a light, inconsequential worker placement game that I could get done in 75 minutes, this would be high on the shortlist. (But why would I ever want to do that?)

I always enjoy this game.  I have the physical game and the iOS version on my iPad.  I have probably played close to 500 games of this on iOS and I STILL enjoy playing it.  Part of the reason is the theme.  I like the D&D theme, the artwork, and flavor text on the mission cards and intrigue cards.  I realize this is just a veneer for a basic worker placement/euro type of game but it is still pleasing to me.  My favorite part is how there is strategy and tactics embedded in this game.  You should pay attention to what other people are trying to do and occasionally stall them some.  I also like how some of the missions provide lasting benefits for the rest of the game.  This makes choosing which missions to invest your limited actions into very important.  Add in the buildings which provide benefits to the owner and you have a very interesting, but not overly complicated, game with thoughtful choices. I sure prefer this game to Stone Age which I found to be extremely dry and boring.

Really thematic worker placement. Might be too simple for some, but for me it has the right combination of theme, depth, play-time and fun.

Would be at least a 9 (possible more) if not for the very bad production quality. (If I receive a better looking replacement deck I might reconsider the rating)

Also this has the worst box I've ever seen. Too big and the lid falls off. Useless, for transportation, also useless for storing on the shelf.

Theme is pasted on.  Easy to learn and play.  This game is akin to an early generation worker placement euro.  No new mechanics and very straight forward.  For a euro, there is a large element of luck due to the draw of Quest and Intrigue cards.  Game play is fairly dull with very little player interaction - pretty much felt like multi-player solitaire.  Components excellent - colorful mounted board, wood cubes, thick chits, and durable cards with very good artwork.  Rulebook is in color and fairly easy to follow.  Game time is short at about 1 hour but feels right.

Pretends to be heavier than it is, which appeals to new Eurogamers who leave feeling accomplished. My worst complaint is that it feels a bit long for the skill level/depth, which is not really a major complaint.

Has replaced Catan as my go-to "intro to Eurogaming" game. Familiarizes players with worker placement and resource management spectacularly. Doesn't overwhelm new players. Forgiving enough to allow early-game mistakes. Interactive enough to keep conversation moving without overwhelming the dialogue.

This is a blinding game. The theme, as with many euro games, is as strong as your imagination will let it be.

I have not played enough to decide, however I do not own skull port and am still super happy with the game.

RATING: 5.5
Quick and fast worker placement game that is fairly decent. The primary issue I have with the game is the sheer randomness of the quests. Some quests give lasting powers that can result in a completely lopsided match if someone starts with them. Outside of that it is fairly decent, just wish the game was longer by a turn or two.

After playing it again I've come to the conclusion that early plot cards can determine the winner fairly easy. All the action spaces are fairly balanced so the deciding factor comes down to who can get the right plot cards that work with their lord. Having a synergy between the two just makes one person a run away leader. I'll play the game again, but I'm wondering how it would be without any plot cards at all...

EDIT: After house ruling it so that no Plot Quests can be given for your two starting quests and removing some Lords that are seen as overpowered, the game is much better. Combined with the expansion it is a decent game (7ish) overall. This is the rating for just the base game though which is forgettable in my eyes.

Our first worker placement game.  Turns out I like worker placement games.  The game is easy to teach and quick to play.

Being quick to play is a big plus with my wife.  After a few games though I started feeling like the game ended to soon.  Once I finally got some buildings to start generating the resources  I need the game ended in a round or two.

My son and  I  played Manhattan Project and we much prefer that worker placement game.

My youngest (6 year old daughter) has been playing this with us for awhile.  I am starting to like this game more and more.  We also just started playing with the expansion and  I think it improves the game.

A decent worker placement game offering a nice variety in terms of "quests" that give future bonuses and a variety of buildings to build for different effect. Rules aren't the best, but much better than most WotC games, and it all plays well.
Consider the rating a 7 if played without the mandatory quests (see below).

Two complaints: 1) The mandatory quests - these are awful. Too much random hosage, too mutually destructive. We've just been leaving them out. 2) The 'Lord' cards. Its not that I mind the idea of having victory bonuses; I like it. But why not an 'Agenda' or something? The only point I can see to making them "lord" cards was to get an extra dose of sexism into the game, which I suppose is to be expected from D&D, but which I still don't like.

Sometimes you just can't get your RP group together or you don't have time to run a full campaign. Problem solved. Waterdeep immerses you in the Forgotten Realms setting and allows you to control the common rabble of adventurers as you vie for control of the City of Splendors. High replay value. Strategy and luck collide as you plot to stab your fellow players in the back...unless you're making deals under the table.

Some say that the theme is pasted on in terms of the cubes being your warriors, rogues, clerics and wizards but I really felt like being a lord (read: quest giver) when playing this game because of all the intrigue. Excellent gateway game that I can just keep playing and playing.

RATING: 7
Straightforward worker placement game that attempts to introduce Euro mechanisms to D&D fans. The aim is to complete quests by collecting adventurers (invariably represented by coloured wooden cubes) and gold from different buildings on the board. This is done by assigning your agents to the buildings. In most cases, once a building has been selected by an agent, no one else can select it for the rest of the turn. Originality is introduced in the way of intrigue cards, whereby you can make life more difficult for your opponents by taking resources off them or assigning them mandatory quests to slow them down. There's also a hidden objective aspect to the game involving the eponymous Lords of Waterdeep who reward extra victory points based on the types of quest a player completes. As a gateway to Euro-style games this works excellently, and there is strategic depth behind the simple gameplay, but beyond the theme and high production values 'LoW' doesn't really bring anything new to experienced players of worker placement games.

Laura's Rank (3/15) – 3.5 out of 5. Pros: Lots of strategy involved. The components are good quality. There is a lot to the game, but it is not an overly difficult game to learn. Cons: Not always going to want to play this because it is a little bit more mentally intense, so it's not really a conversational game.

Ryan's Rank (3/15) – 3.5 out of 5. I really like that there can be some good strategic gameplay. I wish the theme was a bit stronger because I like fantasy. I don't think I'm very good at this game, so that might affect my rating somewhat. As Laura said, it's simple to learn but has lots of good decisions. I think it would be better with more players, but still an enjoyable 2 player game.

Ok so played this 5-6 times and the more I play it the more boring it gets.   The theme is a thin as tissue paper, and means nothing me to in general anyway.

I like Tribune, Carson City and Dungeon Petz better but the modest design of LoW just grabs me.

There is nothing really new here and beacuse you only have two choices of action during half of the game, it feels fast and lighthearted. The big fauna of Intrigue and quest cards spice it up just perfectly.

A fast, light worker placement that is massively swingy and pretty hugely luck dependant (based now on three plays). The 'take that' cards seemed pretty rare and probably determined who didn't win.

It plays in an hour and that saves it; any longer and the luck and randomness would kill it for me. As it is, it is solidly decent.

This game really surprised me. It's a solid worker placement game that is quick to learn and easy to be competitive at. It's not extremely complex, but that's a strength, since I can play this with a group that might not want to play a heavier WP game. Apart from a couple of flaws (mandatory quests, I'm lookin' at you), this is a darned fun game that has just enough theme to please the fantasy/D&D fans, but not so much as to turn off those who don't know, or care, where Waterdeep is or who the Harpers are.

Fun worker placement game. The quest cards and buildings add a good degree of randomness to spice things up. The game moves fairly quickly and gets more tense as the end approaches (there are only 8 rounds to play). It plays in about 1 hour or so, making it easy to bring out. 
   However, it feels like it lacks enough depth and strategy to make it last. An expansion will be coming out that will hopefully add enough depth and variety (and a 6th player)to rectify this. Also, the D&D theme is neat, but fades away once you get playing. That's too bad, and I wish there were a way to evoke the theme more.

Typical worker placement with a gimmick in that it's Dungeons and Dragons and you can get people to play it that otherwise might not be interested.

Not sure about the balance of all the spots and all, but so far it has been fun to play.

Over time, it really gets more meh.  I mean, everyone knows all the spots, and all the games feel pretty much the same.  It gets very repetitive very fast.  I think I'm done with it.

great worker placement game with Dungeons&Dragons theme
interesting perspective to be a manager in D&D world that hires adventurers to send them on quests

+ theme
+ great idea that players can build custom buildings which give new places to put workers (you even get some income when others use your buildings)
+ player interaction with "intrigue" cards and the mechanic to play them (harbor then later second action)
+ only in English (I like that!)
- seems a bit too abstract, I'm not sure if the theme does come through enough
- cubes instead of meeples
- expensive

I came in second (of five) in my first game.  It feels like pretty standard worker placement fare, with a D&D veneer.  It's fun, but I don't have any need to own it. I already own a couple worker placement games that fill the niche nicely: The New Science and AoE III.

Become a shadowy lord attempting to seize influence in Waterdeep. Send your agents to buildings to hire troops, earn money, or perform intrigue actions. Complete quests for additional resources or points. After several rounds the game will end and the player with the most points wins.

An easy to get into worker placement game which scales extremely well from 2 to 5 players. We don't really know anything about the D&D universe but we still enjoyed it really much, although, the theme is admittedly paper thin. The abundance of quests and intrigue cards, the several buildings and the hidden goals you get in the beginning of the game make up for a huge variability. We just find ourselves getting back to Lords of Waterdeep over and over again - and if it is not what describes a great game I don't know what is.

Neat enough, nothing special. Mandatory quests are a weak mechanic: they waste the card-player's tempo; they codify kingmaking; and they arbitrarily limit the card-target's decision space. And that isn't the only mechanic that seems sloppy. I mean, would you ever play without "Open Lord" if given the choice? Balance isn't begotten from the happenstance of failing to draw a given card.

Enjoyable. About the level of theme as Pillars of the Earth: all the spaces have themed names, but that's about it. I think I would have felt more engaged if the cubes were meeples and the odd meeples were anything else.

Maybe a bit on the high-randomness end. A bit of Caylus, a touch of Stone Age, but all in all it seems a competent design; and I'm not inclined to cut WotC any slack. Getting the 6 point per building lord with the 4 point per building power is probably broken.

Has a lot of stomp-the-apparent-leader, and an interesting delayed effect playing intrigue cards.

2-5? I've played 3 and 5. I don't think 5 is bad, just different. Tighter.

Everything, absolutely everything about this product is solid.  It's VERY easy to teach, it plays out of the box, theres next to no set up time.  The components are excellent quality, the artwork is fantastic and the insert... innovative, functional and genius.  I love worker placement games, this might be the best one yet.  The Dungeons and Dragons theme actually blends seemlessly with the gameplay making for a delightful experience.  While it lacks some of the things I love from other titles, this has CONSIDERABLY less play time.  After 2 games of it you can blast through a full game in well under an hour.  Its highly replayable as well do to the questing system (which keeps you constantly engaged throughout the entire game).  Shockingly it plays well with 2 players as well as groups.  I can't give this enough praise... the only draw back I see is that theres not an expansion to add some new mechanics (like unique player abilities for the houses) and some stuff for more serious gamers.  Perfection.  

People who don't like this one or consider it a basic worker placement game are missing the point entirely.  This is a light but serious euro game... you can get anyone to play... with no set up time... out of the box in under an hour... with a theme that doesn't feel tacked on.

It's much better than any Dungeons and Dragons board game has any right being.

Great game that is incredibly easy to teach, a great intro game for new players. Unfortunately the theme seems to be lost on this one (if that is your thing)I always feel like I am just collecting coloured bits to complete random quests for points. Normally this wouldn't be an issue, but a theme is pushed in this game pretty hard, which ends up making the issue stand out a bit more. The Expansion boosts the overall score up to an 8 for me.

An easy to learn, well organized game with deep strategy and agonizing decisions.

Lords of Waterdeep draws on worker placement and resource management mechanics that experienced gamers will be familiar with, but the real strategy in the game involves managing your priorities. 

Waterdeep calls for a delicate balance of playing boldly for immediate benefits and setting yourself up for long chain reactions that can change the dynamic of the game in your favor.

Clearance at B&N

I would play this game anytime. I am sort of split on the expansions.

Yes, it basically is a block pusher. But the theme is as good as you could get for a block pusher. A "behind the scenes" D&D theme is really fun. Collect the necessary people/cash to complete missions. Secret bonuses, worker placement are key. The construction of new building with new abilities and owner rewards makes this game shine.

I shouldn't like this because it's pretty much just another theme-less worker placement game.  But, I like the quests and the Caylus-style buildings.  Somehow the game as a whole comes together better than most worker placement euros.

I'm not sure exactly what it is I like about this game so much. It feels very much like a standard, simple worker placement, but I like the 'quests', the buildings and of course, the very popular 'Scoundrels of Skullport' expansion which adds another dimension to the game with the corruption mechanic.

I've played some somewhat rushed lunchtime games (which really just ended up being teasers and made me get my own copy), and a couple of times at home for a full game.  I do really like it, although I tend to want to be too nice with Intrigue cards.  My husband likes it too, and we've even managed a 6-player game with the expansion.  2 players is quite a different game from, say, 4 (and 6 is crazy long! but we were taking our time and having fun).  With more, it creates more pressure in getting to the buildings one really needs, and player order starts to really count.  It's great to have such a different experience with the same game.

Extremely good well thought out game. Congrats to WotC for making more of their licence and R&D budget. Basic elements of Caylus but far less dry with varied goals to pursue. An element of hidden role adds strategy plus a small amount of screwage but this is a small feature of the game for those usually put off by that.
However its big win is that a for medium complexity game it is only an hour yet it is such great fun to play. It's only April but I suspect that this will be my game of the year. Outstanding.
Oh also tremendously good value. I would normally expect this to be £10 more and I might have swerved it at that price.
Hmmm after a few more plays I've reduced my rating from 9 to 8. It is a very cleverly implemented game with great theme, but it just seems a little too dry without that spark that truly great games have. Maybe I need the expansion!

A game that clearly was one of the first of its kind, due to the high rank but pretty tedious and uninteresting gameplay. Lords of Waterdeep is the most vanilla and unengaging worker placement game I've played. It's still functional, but the take-that mechanics, boring actions to take, and repetitious actions, not to mention the potentially game-crippling hidden role cards, make this game alright, and fine in app form, but not a game I would ever purchase physically.

RATING: 7
Lords of Waterdeep has been described as a very light Caylus and the description is accurate.  Worker placement and cube conversion as gaming mechanisms have run their course, and despite a valiant effort to provide a rich theme, this title is bland.  The very strong build space is nearly always picked first, making initial turn order critical.  Lords of Waterdeep is lighter than Caylus, much easier to get to the table, and much less satisfying.

Very nice worker placement that is set in an interesting setting of Forgotten Realms (D&D). Easy to learn and play while using the setting as a nice addition and flavour. Wooden cubes representing heroes to hire could be better represented by meeples, tokens or something more thematic but otherwise a solid and fun game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I do like:
 - it is easy to start with not experienced players due to simple and straight-forward rules
 - well scaling game, no need in a "dummy" player for 2 players game
 - both direct and indirect player interaction due to intrigue cards, mandatory quests and building ownership bonus
 - you can't do anything really wrong that will spoil you the rest of the game
 - building and quest variety provides plenty of replay

Things they could have done better:

- Faction leaders need more variety. Or maybe it would be better to give people more specific bonus for having that leader (get +1 warrior when taking warriors, etc).
- Lack of theme. The flavor text for quests cards matching types of adventurers/resources to gather seems being the only thing that reminds "you are in Waterdeep".
At least some more thematic meeples for adventurers instead of simple cubes are needed.

A great worker placement game with just enough theme to put it above the others in its category for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
First impression: I would never turn down a game of Lords of Waterdeep but I would never request it.  I'm glad I know people who own it but have no interest in getting a copy for myself.  There's nothing I don't like about it but there's nothing about it that I love.  It may only be one "wow factor" away from being a great game (perhaps that's forthcoming in the expansion?).  As is, it's engaging and very approachable, just not at all memorable.  

UPDATE 1: Like Pillars of the Earth, this one has a short shelf life -- it's had sharply diminishing returns after a positive first impression.  I was hoping it would be a system with some depth to be explored, but the depth is pretty much explored before the end of that first game.  It needs more drama, more intrigue, and more dynamism.  The Intrigue cards, Quests, Lords, and Buildings should provide variety but fail to adequately do so.  Hopefully the expansion helps in this regard.

There is also a complete disconnect between the theme and the game.  I'm not hiring thieves, clerics, wizards, and fighters; I'm collecting black, white, purple and orange cubes.  This makes the game feel much too dry of an exercise for something with the Dungeons & Dragons brand.

Positives that don't diminish with repeated plays are that it has a very good aesthetic (apart from the too-small VP icons on the Quest cards), games last as long as they should, and it's a very clean design.

UPDATE 2: I actually like the game more on the iPad.

To be honest - this is the first game I did not want to like. After all, evidence that this was a game with a pasted on them were too big. And I thought mixing a worker placement/resource management game with random Take that elements would not go well. Because usually the "Take that"-elements in such games results from how your opponents placed their workers. This placement can be crucial and screw your plans.

However, despite the totally pasted on theme, I found that this game is running smoothly and that the balance is maintained even with this double impact "Take that"-mechanic. It's fast with a lean rule set and quite enjoyable. It sure copies some here and there and has a feel of Le Havre - a game it doesn't stand a chance against - but overall it's a good design.

This game has a common but utterly fatal Achiles heel: The Winning Strategy. Certain Quests and Properties are just so overwhelming superior in their ratio of difficulty::Reward that a player who knows what they're doing knows to snatch it up immediately. From there, it's just a matter of who knows the game best, or how dumb luck breaks in terms of what quests/properties drop on whose turns if everyone knows what to look for. The worst part is it's not even THAT complicated... You'll know in and out how to win (and thus why you're losing if someone beats you to it) at all times by your 5th game or so. People really talk this game up, and I don't know if they're slow or the people they play with are or what, but it's just a source of grumbling and eye-rolling with people I play with. Bogus RNG: The Game.

Worker placement game with a D&D theme. You collect cubes and coin to complete quest. Most VP wins. The expansion gives even more options by enticing you with better reward at a cost of potential negative VP (skulls). I wouldn't play without the expansion.

I wish I liked this game more! In many ways it's good fun, and the way you compete for quests (i.e. projects on which to spend the resources your workers gain) as well as the resources themselves is good. However, it has a number of issues which prevent it getting a better rating from me.

1) Play time and turn time. The beauty of the worker-placement mechanic ought to be that it makes play smooth by reducing the number of decisions for a player. Place worker, resolve, start planning next move while everyone else takes theirs. Waterdeep really undermines this you have have a move which goes as follows;

- Place worker
- Decide which of your Intrigue cards to play
- Ask each other player whether they wish to take an opportunity offered to them by your Intrigue card
- Resolve a Quest which you are now able to resolve because of the benefits of the Intrigue card you played
- Choose an additional Quest from the menu

This means turns can end up much longer than you want.

2) Lack of theme
There is Dungeons & Dragons chrome slapped all over the game, no doubt about it - everything in the game has a generic fantasy-sounding name drawn from the glorious fantasy mishmash that is the official D&D multiverse.

However, there is nothing in the way the game plays that feels at all D&D. Once you've got the idea that you're collecting wood, grain, wool and wine rather than rogues, warriors, priests and wizards, there is nothing (apart from the slightly silly polysyllabic names for everything) to make you feel you're in the D&D world. 

3) Luck of the draw / secret roles.
Each player gets dealt a secret role at the start of the game giving them bonuses to certain sorts of quests. I don't hugely like this feature because it railroads you in one direction a bit too much and tends to diminish the amount of strategic depth.

What's more the selection of quests on offer is relatively limited, and the selection of buildings that produce more than the standard number of each resource (sorry, character class) is also fairly limited. So if you are lucky that the quests on offer to you fit the random role you have which fits your initial/early deal of quests which fits the buildings that are dealt, you have actually quite a big initial advantage. Too big an advantage, in my view, for the level of depth and investment in the game...

This is a great family worker placement game. It's each to teach and the spots of the board are very easy to grasp. The only reason this is out of my collection not is because Champions of Midgard replaced it. I like the mechanics better in that game. I find more stuff to do and fighting the monsters is great to. But Lords of Waterdeep is a solid pick for getting your family together to play a causal worker placement game.

RATING: 7
Solid Worker placement game, but it felt too short, and had very little pressure. The hidden lords also make it very hard to gauge how you are doing at any one time, which means the decision space is more about playing your own game than interacting with the other players. More plays required.

I'm a bit surprised how high this game is. It isn't that it's a bad game, it's just that there are far superior worker placement games on the market that I would barely ever request this one. Sure, if this was the only worker placement I had available, it would be a good game. It's just that with all the other better games available, I will always pick those instead of this one.

Good game, but a bit too light for my taste. Most games will end close due to the ability to hinder opponents with intrigue cards, and the simplicity of the mechanics make this a great gateway game. As I prefer heavier euros I definitely need to try it with the expansion.

Really good introductory Worker Placement game. Pretty easy to teach to new people. I watched the TableTop episode, and discerned how to play this. I was able to teach the novices in my group, and one went on to then beat me. 

Make sure to reassure the new players that they will understand after a the first couple of rounds. There are quite a few pieces, and if they watch the setup it can look daunting. 

Another thing for the game, is the box it comes in. Not enough praise is given for the way the insert is designed to house the components. Everything has its spot, and is easy to get back out for the next play. It helps with the setup, but the teardown is just a bit more. It is worth it though.

What I like:

This is really just a very well made medium/semi-light worker-placement game. It's balanced, good-looking, has some cool upgrades and I love that you get to build new actions for you and others to use (while you benefit from it). 
-Playing time hits a very nice sweet spot that other similar games usually are unable to get their games down to. 
-The added theme is just a bonus. It actually made me feel quite immersed despite just being a worker-placement game. 

What I dislike:
-The lords. Don't understand why they didn't make these more interesting. I guess having them all (almost) do the same makes for a more balanced experience, but a game of this weight and randomness can definitely allow itself to include some more variety in this regard. While we're at that, what's with the one odd-ball? The builder?? It's so weird that they decided to include just one who is different from the rest (and might be slightly better)
-Sometimes you might want something a bit more heavy

Facinating phenomenon. Not a bad game by a stretch, but consider me part of the crowd who does'nt understand the hype. 

Worker Placement for people who don't dig euro games too much. Pleasant way to pass the time, but only barely scratches the gamer-itch. Not enough control over the strategy to excuse the glued-on theme. Not enough fun to excuse the randomness.

The 6 is for the fact that my gaming group always can agree on this, a value not to be underestimated. Used to be a 7, but I feel little in control when playing this game. Seems to be fooling anyone else though.

People who say that this game is actually highly thematic are the same people who enjoy Michael Bay movies.

I wish I could quantify why this game is so good.  Like a lot of my favorite titles, it offers strong choices, tight gameplay, an almost guaranteed close finish between players, and a cool theme.

Very easy to pickup and learn, but meaty enough to bend your mind.

This game strips out almost everything that might bog down your typical worker placement game and leaves you with a simple, quick game that still has all the decisions and complexity of games that are much longer.

Nothing major, nothing really bad. The production value is above average, but the gameplay is just, well, more of the same but with a "new" packcage. Caylus can put this one in its pocket.

Great into to worker placement, easy to teach and faster than most.  Luck is a bigger point swing than skill though (when every board space is carefully calibrated to be equal, it's hard to overcome poor quest luck via clever moves), so I would go to a better worker placement game with a more hardcore group.

Worker placement generates adventurers (warriors, rogues, clerics and mages). Specific combinations fulfill quests for which you get VP. Intrigue cards add a bit of randomness including some limited interaction. Simple rules yet a very fun game. There are a couple of missed opportunities that no doubt we will see if there are expansions: a) the 'Lord' cards (grant extra VP at end of game on condition) are all rather similar - only one awards points for something other than specific combinations of quests completed; b) the game booklet takes time to describe the different factions (colours players can choose) but they are all the same - how about making it so they all have different perks?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
For a while, I found this game too simplistic as a worker placement and with a silly pasted-on theme. Then, I got the expansion and the DnDeeples, and my enjoyment is growing and growing. It's about the perfect weight and play time for my medium-gaming family and many friend groups. The theme continues to be silly (hey, I love DnD but this cube-collecting exercise is nothing like DnD)...but you can take advantage of the sillyness and play it up. (Like the DnDeeples, as we now begin to anthropomorphize our cubes, calling them "guys" and being more invested in their use)

What is pushing this over the edge into a top game for me is the Skullport expansion. I love the added decisions with the corruption...how much can I take and still benefit? how much can I remove before the end? For me, this added mechanism is fabulous. For my wife, she is more meh on it. I was more meh on Undermountain, as it adds very little to decide upon.

Lords of Waterdeep is an amazing game full of variety and strategy. Its is a game that draws the thematic crowd in to it but also if you're playing with family you can just say, these cards tell you what cubes you need to acquire and once you have all necessary cubes you score points. It is a very smooth game all around and I love it!

Everything that is bad in the industry.

It is the most uninspired euro I ever saw, they played it safe to the highest degree, generic mechanics mangled in a generic game.

In a genial marketing scheme they forced a paper thin generic fantasy theme in and called the resource cubes warriors and clerics and so forth, that had resulted in the laughable perception by many that this game is super thematic, after all anything with a guy with a sword in the cover is.

To guarantee maximum appeal to the lowest common denominator they squeezed in some ridiculous munchkin style take that cards.

No meaningful decision is ever needed, all moves are patently obvious and the game is decided by luck and who people decide to attack. In 2 years the people who fall for this sort of scheme will have moved on to the next hotness and this mess will be forgotten.

I like this game and for me it could be on my top 10 if one detail doesn't exist. Unfortunately it has one thing that I really dislike: some intrigue cards are only useful to destroy one of the opponents game (they give an annoying quest to an opponent) and nonthing in return for the player.

I played the iOS version quite a bit. I have the physical board game but haven't played it yet. It's really an odd game that mixes Euro-style worker placement gameplay in with the D&D Forgotten Realms world. Though I think the original intention was to get D&D people to buy a Euro-style boardgame, it actually is a great intro into both Eurogaming and the Forgotten Realms world. Some people may be turned off by the heavy fantasy theme but the production of the game is great. It has a beautiful game board map and artwork. Great game play that isn't too hard to pick up.

The game works and requires a moderate level of planning.  Your secret victory condition is a random determinant of how you will focus your gameplay and if you get builder then the experience will be extremely monolithic.  The game capitalizes on the D&D reference without providing any connection to the adventure aspect that most people associate with the game.  In the end Lords of Waterdeep is a bland Ameritrash version of a Eurogame style that is implemented better in Alien Frontiers, Puerto Rico, and many Martin Wallace designs.

Rating after first play. Plays very fast, never enough actions to do what you want. I like that. Tablemates felt it was too random, and that the builder guy was overpowered (he won by a good 30 points, and apparently has in previous games as well). I had some "+ for arcane quests" guy, and was very much at the mercy of the shuffle. I know that in these sort of games, I like building stuff, and not getting victory points for my buildings felt counterintuitive.

My revised rating, and really I could push it lower.  Absolutely no theme here, less than Trajan, in reality, and entirely a cube pusher with worker placement.

The skulls expansion does it give it some less rotten flesh on decrepit bones, but cannot hide the stench of this stinking corpse of a game.  I give it

Lords of Waterdeep is a great worker placement game with a fair amount of strategy. I really enjoy it. My only gripe with the game overall is that while I enjoy the theme it doesn't draw me in like some other games I own/have played. I don't feel like I am doing the quests. I feel like I am competing for the resources I need to win the game. If the theme drew me in more the game would definitely go up to a 9...possibly a 10.

RATING: 5
A decent game to serve as an introduction to worker placement but it gets stale quickly.

In my opinion, the shortcomings fall into several camps:

* Tacked on theme. This could certainly be said of many Euro games and worker placement in general, but I felt LoW was even worse than most. The theme is entirely superfluous and it basically feels like I'm just shuffling cubes around. Again, not unique to LoW but certainly still there.

*Very few bad moves. It just kind of feels like you'd be hard pressed to "screw up" your strategy. Bad moves are pretty obvious: don't stock up on 5 wizards when you don't need them for quests. But beyond that, sure. Just toss an agent on any available space. Collect shit. Convert it to VP.

*Very strict relative values for different resources. Basically, everything in the game is geared toward 2 black or orange being equal to 1 purple or white. In a way, it almost feels like all of the quests, buildings and intrigue cards are too balanced, to the point that you're just making moves of equal value in every turn. Seriously. It seems like well over half of the intrigue cards are "Take 2 cubes of ___ color and pick an opponent to take 1." I've played games where that's the only type of intrigue I get, which I find extremely boring.

*So little variation in the role cards. Basically, all but one are "Score +4 VP for these two quest types." A decent portion of the game comes comes down to the randomness of "do one or two people overlap with your quest types?" I don't think I've ever lost when I've had two quests all to myself. I get them easily and have less competition for the cube types that are most in demand for those quests.

I wanted to love this game. I really did. But I just don't.

Lords Of Waterdeep is a very straightforward worker placement game with beautiful components, a strong fantasy theme and some take that elements (the mandatory quest cards). Not yet sure whether that last aspect is a blessing or curse, but it certainly gives the game a unique ameritrash/euro hybrid feel. My first play was quite a relaxed and entertaining experience, but with two players it did not offer the level of suspense as, say, stone age (another family worker placement game). With three, the game was much better - easily up to par with other family level worker placement games.
UPDATE: My last two player game was great - filled with suspense and very interactive. We made a house rule to prevent receiving a second mandatory quest until you played one yourself.
UPDATE: When played with the expansion, this game is almost perfect. Raised my rating to a 9.

Remove all the chrome and this game is quite simple and at its core, this is a basic worker placement game with a D&D theme tacked on to it. Players allocate agents over various landmarks around the City of Waterdeep to collect resources which they will then cash in for victory points by fulfilling different objectives. Place workers, get cubes, spend cubes, get VP. Sounds familiar? Still, the game does what it was designed to do well. It is a great introductory game for the worker placement mechanic along the lines of Stone Age. The only drawback is that players not steeped in D&D terminology and lore won't get all the references and it is tough to see how collecting cubes could "save the Harpers from imminent death and destruction". That said, you could play this game entirely ignoring the flavor text and just focus on the icons of cubes and colors. I enjoy the game as a casual player, while simultaneously wishing it could be a little more advanced.

There's nothing wrong with this game. It just felt kinda boring for me. Pretty typical worker placement game.

You draft cards that amount to "get this many colored cubes." Then you place on spots to collect those colored cubes. Couple bonuses here and there, and one spot allows you to open new spots that give more colored cubes.

Lords of Waterdeep is a great worker placement game, similar to Stone Age. I prefer the former due to the randomized buildings and quests instead of the randomness of the die rolling for resources. The theme is nice too, since I loved the old Forgotten Realms novels and played AD&D 2nd edition, so it's nostalgic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not a big fan of the theme, but that's not all important. But I think gameplay is too simple, placing workers for income of cubes and placing workers for spending cubes. In the long run I think this would become boring, also since I don't care that much for the thematic components like quests etc. Sold it on.

RATING: 6
The gameplay is more engaging than Stone Age, but the theme is just . . . not . . . there.  I'll gladly play LoW, but I believe that interest will lessen once I've had a chance to finally play games such as Agricola.  So far it seems really over hyped.  If it remains to climb in the ratings (it's currently well within the top 50) then I would say that was definitive proof of how inaccurate BGG's ratings are.  The game is so detached from its theme its ridiculous.  This is in part due to the idea of "recruitment" instead of resources.  When you play a typical worker placement game you're getting something like wood, brick or stone.  In this game you're recruiting "wizards" etc.  They're cubes!  

I find this to be a stimulating game for 4p and 5p and I would never turn it down at those player counts.  But at 2p there are simply better games such as Agricola All Creatures Big and Small.  Throw in the utter detachment from its theme and to me that says the game does not warrant its rating.  This one, while good, is over hyped.  Period.

Because of that I have to lower my rating.  I just can't contribute to the warped ranking here on BGG.

I found this game to be much less interesting than other worker placement games. It definitely did not live up to the hype for me, as there are dozens of other Euros that play in the same amount of time that I would much rather play. I didn't find it to be well-themed either; to me it just felt like collecting cubes, and was much more abstracted than Agricola, for example.

This is a great game!  One of my favorites from 2012!!  This is a fairly easy game to learn.  But, there is enough strategy there to keep this interesting for the whole game!  The turns are fairly quick, and since you are placing your "workers" one at a time, it keeps the game moving from player to player!  This is an easy game to bring out, and is a hit with my board game group!  I highly recommend Lords of Waterdeep!!

RATING: 5.5
Acceptable introduction to worker placement games (Stone Age does a better job of filling that niche IMO) that quickly becomes tedious when you realize that there are very few, if any, meaningful and non-obvious decisions to be made.   

It's worth perhaps a dozen plays, no more. That this is ranked as a strategy game ahead of Imperial and Hansa Teutonica is beyond me.

absolutely nothing special in terms of the mechanics, but it is surprisingly "adequate" as a generic euro considering the publisher- which is to say it is playable and appears decently balanced at first blush.

I would play it again, but doubt I'd be the one to suggest it, just because it's so plain.

The box and insert quality, however, are way, WAY above average.

---

2 games played, 2 games where the winner was the guy who got a quest first thing that gives more points for same color quests that matched their secret lord goal.  This may be a problem.  Also, just starting with 2 quests that match your lord is an 8 point swing (which is a very meaningful amount) for no reason.

This didn't grab me either.  The game just seemed to be more worker placement but in a lighter game.  The new job buildings came up randomly, the quests were pretty random, there was a bit of screwage, nothing really stood out.  Troyes does everything this does but better (my jury is still out on the super combos).

Sadly, the theme was pasted on and the game felt like collecting four colors of cubes and selling different patterns off for points.  The lousy Harpers took a day off and had me deal with the Zents.

I think this game would be improved by some sort of team play via a group defence mechanism, like Troyes or The Republic of Rome.

RATING: 5
I don't like take-that which can be targeted at a specific player versus the whole table. Sure, it is a viable design choice used to rein in the leader(s) but too often it gets employed as tit-for-tat as opposed to targeted for optimal play and that never fails to depress me. Of course, a devil's advocate would point out this is a problem with the players, not the game. But when it happens, I find the experience just ruins the gaming fun for me, so I'd rather not play games where the potential exists. (Further, with the secret goals, it just targets the perceived leader and so adds nothing to balance.)

Lastly, while I love worker placement, the variance in the Intrigue cards really mitigates what I love in worker placement: brutal-no-wiggle-room strategy+tactics.

RATING: 5.5
Take a halfway decent but completely standard themeless worker placement game and throw in a bunch of player-targeted effects and you have Waterdeep.  I enjoy worker placement so I still like the basic gameplay, but it's extremely basic and brings nothing worthwhile to the genre.  The individual player bonuses isn't so much an interesting difference as it is a way to force you to only go for certain quests (the bonus is simply too great to ignore it much if at all).

It's strictly better if you remove the Mandatory Quest cards and I strongly recommend it.

Oct 2017: 
Rating -2 (to 8 from 10).  Still a good game, still a great gateway.  However, as we've moved on to some mid-weight WP (Coal Baron and Yedo), this has lost some of its appeal.  We bought but don't really use/enjoy the expansion (other than allowing an extra player).  The base game plays just fine without and works better as a gateway/intro to WP without.  If we want something meatier, we reach for another game that has a stronger theme and more interesting mechanics.

Original (Jan 2017):
My new favorite game!  I wanted to try a "true" worker placement after enjoying Via Nebula.  Wavered between this and Champions of Midgard, which some say has replaced this.  So glad I went with Lords of Waterdeep because this has instantly become a favorite for me and others I play with.  The rulebook makes it look deceptively difficult - it's really not that hard to teach and the rules give lots of detailed examples to avoid confusion.  I play with some AP-prone people and even they, for the most part, don't take excruciatingly long to take their turns with this game.

+ Scoundrels of Skullport: A great expansion!  Two modules.  Undermountain adds a 6th player and a new board with 3 new spaces to visit.  It keeps the same mechanics so you can still use it with new players without adding additional complexity.  New quests and lords add some new twists.  The second module, Skullport, adds a new resource, Corruption, as well as new places to visit.  This one definitely adds more complexity to the game so is one you'll want to save for more seasoned players.

I ignored this game for a long time.  The D&D title, the bland colored board, the gateway game label, nothing about it really excited me.  But man was I wrong in the best kind of way.

It's certainly not a heavy, thinky Euro, but it hits a really sweet balance.  It's easy to teach with slick iconography and a game that grows as you play.  Every game feels different as you try to maximize your secret end game scoring with the quests and buildings available to you to find little mini-engines to create while hampering your opponents plans.

I'd probably rate the base game closer to a 7.5, but with the expansion there is a nice added layer of depth and TONS of replay value.  The game is really fun when you can combo buildings with passive quests and the expansion adds much more of that along with the excellent corruption track.

My only real complaints are that the game feels like it starts to drag and it's harder to pull off a plan with 4 or more players.  Also, there are occasions where you just get a boring setup. A string of bad buildings and no quests with fun ongoing effects.  If you don't get any fun combo's that create little engines, the simplicity of the games core mechanics stand out and the game can feel tedious.

Through your agents, you recruit adventurers to go on quests on your behalf, earning rewards and increasing your influence over the city. Expand the city by purchasing new buildings that open up new actions on the board, and hinder – or help – the other lords by playing Intrigue cards to enact your carefully laid plans. During the course of play, you may gain points or resources through completing quests, constructing buildings, playing intrigue cards or having other players utilize the buildings you have constructed.

Overrated game.  It has nice artwork, but it's really a very weak Euro.

The theme really feels pasted on.  In some games, this is ok, but LoW tries so hard that you just want it to stop.  There is no way that you feel pious by taking white cubes or feel like a warrior for taking red.  The theme is about the worst I've seen in a game.

The balance is bad.  If the person to your right always goes out of his way to be first player, then you always get to be second player for free, which is huge.  You should have no problem beating the person who is always last.

I like the idea of adding quests to a Euro game, so I do have to give some points here.  But the quests are a bit unfair.  Some are clearly designed for the early part of the game, and others are clearly for the end.  One person is going to get lucky, where all the quests he wants come up at the right time.  There's no mitigation of this luck.

It's not a terrible game.  The designers clearly know a bit about making games.  But, it's extremely overrated.  I would never ever buy this, as I seem to have plenty of chances to play it anyway.  It seems to be one of the first games that D&D players jump to buy, just because they think it will bridge well their two favorites styles of games.

I've only played this game with the expansion, so my comments are based on the complete package.

This game is like a perfect chicken sandwich -- it's a well-understood idea, with basic execution, but at the end of the day, it is still immensely satisfying.

There's nothing new here, as it is yet another worker placement game with cubes you turn in to gain VP, all with a thin layer of theme that will be forgotten within minutes of the rules explanation.  But under all that, it's a very polished game.  The buildings, quests, and intrigue cards provide just enough variety for repeated play.  The actions on the board are just superbly balanced, in a way that hearkens back to the older, simpler euros of the late 90s and early aughts.  A very impressive design.

RATING: 8
This is a well-made, D&D themed worker placement game. 
 Production quality is very nice (e.g. the very unique money tokens, the large meeples, and the use of some D&D stock art on the cards.)  The game is simple enough for anyone to pick up, but there was enough depth to make us want to play it many times over.
Only have 2 piddly complaints:  They should have added a few more Lords with different victory conditions, and they could have integrated more of the various stories/quests from the Forgotten Realms series (Drizzt, perhaps?)
Anyway, this is a great break away from the traditional farm-based worker placement game, and we've really enjoyed it.

Solid worker placement game that seems to borrow quite a few mechanics from other games and mixes them up. It ends up working together surprisingly well. The little wooden cubes detracts a bit from imagining thieves/fighters/clerics/wizards adventuring, but as a fan of D&D I did enjoy the theme.

Uninspired Worker placement. 2 years ago I had this at an 8+ but subsequent plays have been boring and downright mediocre. The expansion doesn't help this, it only adds more time to an already overly long game. Overly long in that you don't feel as if your work is being rewarded. Collect this stuff to turn in this stuff, rinse repeat.

A nice worker placement game, feels a bit like Caylus (in a good way). I have played only one three player play, it was nice that even though you could get 25 points from one quest and we all received over 150 points, we were all within then points in the end. Might be different with more experienced players.

We didn't have time to focus on the theme much, just counting cubes and coins. It could feel better, if the theme is familiar.

Добротное евро. Ничего сверхвосторженного. Нравится Кайлюс - понравится и эта. Сеттинг - сугубо наносное, визарды выжимают капельки из брендовой собственности.
Общий дизайн и компоненты хорошие. Дизайн карт порадовал -  пользоваться удобно. 
Концепция англ. рулбука на четверочку. Русский перевод Носова добавляет несуразностей и ляпов.

PERMANENT PLACE IN COLLECTION

UPDATE: After 5 plays, I've upped the rating of this game from 7.5 to 9. It's easy to teach, deep enough to be enjoyed by regular game players, streamlined, plays differently each game, is interactive, thematic and - with the wonderful DnDeeples - it's a visually beautiful game too. I can't fault this one in any way. I'm so glad I traded for it. It's incomparably better than Last Will, which it replaced. Believe the hype, this game is excellent.

RATING: 7
Good, worker placement, cube pusher game with pasted on Dungeons & Dragons theme (the different coloured cubes are supposedly warriors and mages etc. - for me they were oranges, charcoal, snowballs and plums - which you use to build buildings and complete quests). Very much like Caylus / Caylus Magna Carta without the road and provost but with added intrigue "take that" cards and secret goals for additional victory points at the end of the game. Plays very smoothly and quickly - almost too quickly as you do not get to use your "engine" for long.

Almost like a (meaty in a fast food way) filler for gamers and the worker placement 101 game to play with non-gamers, casual gamers and newbies.

A great combination of a euro game with a D&D theme. The best thing about this game is the mechanics make sense, are easy to remember and the board is superbly designed so you very quickly understand is  what you need to do. My only quibble is that the agents should look more thematic (mini meeples with different shapes?) rather than plain coloured cubes.

The game has a nice feel to it.  It's a light worker placement game, where players want to build up an engine to allow them opportunities for better opportunities later in the game, so it's not particularly original, but it does what it does pretty well.  I'm a little bummed that a lot of the interaction in the game is randomly drawn from a deck, and that they can also wind up being interrupts at crucial points in the game.  I prefer the interaction to come from the worker placement aspect of it, so I would almost always prefer to play Stone Age over this.  At least there the information, while random, isn't thrust on you at the worst possible moment.

Everyone enjoys it well enough and the rules are simple enough I don't need to re-read them every time we think it may come out. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. This is our go-to game. The absolute best 2P worker placement game for couples. God, do we love it. It is easy to learn, quick to set up, always varied without feeling random, rewarding even if you lose, challenging but not exhausting - you name it.

It is hard to put in words why it is so great, I guess it is the right ratio between competitiveness and lack of competitiveness: Yes, it matters who gets to chose where to  place the workers first. No, it all is not lost when you go second. 

The game also feels "productive" rather than "destructive". The worst you can do to an opponent is to have them build a small thing on the side (which ads victory points) before moving on. 

The expansion adds the complexity some people crave it. It is almost too much for me. The base game is just so suave and perfect as it is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It is beyond me why this game has such a high rating on BGG. Everything about this game is so uninspired and generic and boring. It takes one of the most overused mechanic in board games - worker placement - and strips out everything that makes this mechanic interesting in other games like the provost in Caylus, or feeding of Agricola/StoneAge. It takes also the most generic overused theme and barely paints it over the game (just putting text on the cards doesn't make the game thematic!). It does not offer any interesting choices nor interesting player interaction. Yes the Intrigue cards are there for player interaction but most of them are just take some cube from someone or just slap mandatory quests on to someone. 

It would have been understandable if this game had come out a decade ago when WP wasn't a thing. If intro to worker placement is the only redeeming  quality of this game then even in that case there are better games likes StoneAge which are more thematic, more fun and give a more complete experience of worker placement. Also worker placement isn't such a complicated concept to grasp that you need to ease people into it using an intro game, especially a boring one such as this.

Enjoyable but very standard worker placement. I find it odd that the game is feels completely unrelated to its setting.

RATING: 7
My first run through the rulebook left me thinking, "That's it?". The worker placement mechanics and basic economy of the game are so simple, there was no way this game would hold my attention for a single session, much less multiple games. You don't even have to struggle to gain more workers like most games of this ilk, it just arbitrarily gives you another worker half way through the game.

Well, I guess this is why they say you can't judge a book by it's cover. Despite the inherent simplicity of the game, there ends up being a signifigant amount of fun to be had. I think there are a couple of reasons for this. One, there is just enough player vs. player interaction in the intrigue cards to keep everyone involved. Two, the mission cards are so well done that players rarely see that they are trading three white cubes and a black one for five orange cubes and 12 Victory Points. They see three holy men and a rogue with a good conscience infiltrating a keep and freeing a squad of five freedom fighters. The theme really comes through thanks to the logical relationships presented between the quest titles and their rewards.

Truly jaded Euro gamers are not going to be tempted by this title, but for new players to the genre and open-minded veterans with big imaginations, Lords of Waterdeep truly is greater than the sum of its parts.

Variant: When playing with a snobby Euro fan, always refer to the hero classes as the following: Fighters = Carrots, Wizards = Turnips, Clerics = Reeds and Rogues = Boars. Then watch the aforementioned Euro snob struggle with attacking the game for being themeless, all while simultaneously trying to defend the clearly nonexistent theme by making you call the cubes by their correct names. It never gets old...


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Enjoyable but shallow (compared to other worker placement games on this list), also feels way too kindly in how it treats player interaction. It has cards and systems specifically for messing with each other but it's like a nerf battle compared to Caylus or similar's all out slap-fight.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Used to be one of my favorites (with expansion of course) but I have overplayed this game and I feel burned out otherwise the ranking will be higher. This game is dull without the expansion and if I ever play it again soon it will be only with the expansion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
6 might be a little harsh on a 10 point scale - solidly a 3 star game out of 5, at any rate.

It's not the worst worker placement game I've played, but it's also far from the best. There's just enough direct player interaction to allow leader bashing (heed the "Take That" mechanic in the description), which led to a lot of frustration from the former leader. The random quests and rewards make me feel like I have less control than I do in something like Agricola - that is, I don't feel like a bad hand in the latter dooms me as much as not seeing quests that match my bonus in this game.

The biggest issue is that there is WAY too much going on. Human beings can only keep on average about 7 things in working memory at a time. There are so many ways to score points here - and so few barriers to making any given move - that it's very prone to AP. Comparing to Agricola again, if I don't have open spaces in fields, I can immediately dismiss any action involving taking animals for that turn. There's not really a comparable narrowing process here, and by the end of the game we'd built so many building that there were literally about 20 reasonable choices and the score was close enough it seemed worthwhile to try and squeeze out an extra point or two.

Ultimately I think the game is more mental effort and time consuming than it's worth, though I still wouldn't call it a bad game. The components are well engineered for streamlining play and the decisions, if a little too open, can be interesting.

There are a lot of allegedly "themeless" games or those with "pasted on themes" and often this isn't a problem for me as long as mechanically something interesting is happening. 

Waterdeep falls into the same class as Splendor in which nothing is happening. About the most interesting thing it has to offer is placement spaces the allow delayed re-allocation at the end of round, a common feature of worker placement titles of the era. No amount of chrome, lore-text or art can prevent this from being a completely flavourless experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A whole lot of visual theme from the map, characters, buildings, and quests, but the theme quickly gives way to acquiring and spending colored cubes and the resulting VP advancement.  There's a fair bit of chaos with the "Intrigue" cards that can heavily influence the game.  But the game plays fairly quick so the impact of the chaos isn't an evening-buster.

Really good action selection, cube trading game with a fun theme.  There's more luck than some other games of this type, with the way bonuses for quest types work.  Sometimes your quest types just don't come up.  The flip side of that is that when they do, you better jump all over them (and stock up), because you never know when a dry spell will come.

We took out the Mandatory Quests and it was quite a nice game with lot of positive interaction that way. But it doesn't seem balanced at all, in the end it lacks the elegance of great eurogames. The card play seems to be most of the the fun factor here, but for that, Archon or Viticulture is way more interesting for me. The buildings are another interesting part, but they didn't feel that interesting. 
If we house rule the game to have only positive interactions it's an okay game for me, but with all the kingmaking "i point at you" stuff i won't play it.

Not every worker placement game has to be 100% calculable, sometimes it's cool to have an ace up your sleeve and surprise your opponents. Well, this game allows you to do just that. There is a lot of take that here, but this is what separates Lords of Waterdeep from other typical euros from this genre. It's simple, but demanding. Can't wait to check out the expansion.

The only thing I'm not sure I like yet is Mandatory Quest mechanism. They really slow down someone's progress and feel ultra mean, especially when all players try to bash the leader.

What I Dislike-
Mandatory missions can make some players feel picked on. I don't mind them. I wish the buildings were worth endgame victory points, not just for the person who got that particular lord bonus.

Worker placement with a D&D theme.  If you are a D&D fan and are looking to try a worker placement game, this is for you.

A fairly simple, straight-forward worker placement game that is decently fun. It has started to lose its spark after 20 plays or so, I think mostly because there isn't much variety and only very light player interaction.

The game's design is solid and it would make for a great gateway game for more casual players. For me, it would take some big renovations to make me want to play it further. Perhaps the expansion would make it more appealing in that way.

RATING: 8
I picked this one up from the release date because I knew that if there was going to be D&D branding on a worker placement game then it would be a good recruiting tool.

Little did I know that the game provides compact and engaging gameplay and has a good deal of appeal for even the established gamers.

A keeper for sure!

Enjoyable lightweight worker placement. Overall a quite nice game, I'd count the lightweightedness as the only downside. I don't even mind how the game feels more like collecting cubes than completing quests. Might be slightly too fiddly for what it is.

RATING: 4
An euro with thin pasted on theme. You have 4 types of ressouce cubes, plus money, and use them to fulfill order cards. Throw in a bit of chaos from the intrigue cards, and you end up with an ok game; a point subtracted for adding too much luck into whats basically an abstract strategic game.

Only played the iOS version so far, and rarely win. Always close games, and feel quick.

Update: Some hard earned wins, which I like. Prefer a game that rewards skilful play to a luck based game that you lose despite skilful play.

Update: Love the iOS version (with expansions). Have AI on Hard on iOS and win a good number of games, but that's with the luxury of being able to consider my moves, not sure how that would translate to playing cardboard version where it would be considered AP. Looking forward to playing IRL.

This worker replacement game is very fun. Good components and great art work. The replay ability is vast. Once you get how it plays you can try and form strategies, but the luck of the cards you have always changes game play. The interaction you have with other players is fun. Good game night fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.7
I agree that it is kind of like "Yedo-lite".  It is certainly a pasted-on theme, which is OK b/c I'm not thrilled with the dark D & D theme.  It can become a "cube pushing" type of game, but it is still very enjoyable!  I find the decision making between the quick, low-point value quests and the longer high-point quests an interesting dilemma.  The expansion pushes this from an "alright" game to a "good game".  Nevertheless, once you acclimatize  to Waterdeep, the next step is Yedo, which is an excellent game.

This is one of my favourite worker  placement games, the artwork is fantastic, the different missions, lords and buildings give some variety for replayability and the intrigue cards throw a bit of chaos and competition into the mix.

Yes! Oh Lords, yes! The quintessential worker placement game! There aren't many games I would happily pay more than €40 for, but I'd buy this one again in a heartbeat. Works great as a gateway game, yet offers plenty of strategy for the experienced gamer. Still in my top 5 games two years after I bought it. Do yourself a favor, and at least get the mobile version: the asynchronous multiplayer works superbly and the graphics are excellent.

RATING: 10
Wow. What a great game. I totally dismissed this game when I first saw it, but then I read a review that stressed how fun and easy to learn it was, so I bought a copy. My wife likes it because she tends to like Euro games and it's short. My 10 year old daughter likes it because it's short and easy to learn and she likes the theme. Even my non-gaming 14 year old daughter played and liked it. This is unprecedented! A game my whole family can (and is willing to) play together! Awesome! I really didn't think the combination of fantasy adventure theme and Euro mechanics would sell, but boy was I wrong!

Smooth game. Surprising how fast we could teach to first time players and they were off and running.  Everyone is in it till the end.  Plenty of ways to screw-your-neighbor as players gang up on the perceived leader.  Allows for some bluffing to avoid being target of the nasty pile on. Pretty heavy random factor with quest bonuses. We are having fun playing this but it's simplicity is also its weakness for replay value. Go places to collect sets of colored cubes. Rinse, wash, repeat.

This is a very forgiving and fairly simple worker placement game.  Each turn, you will make choices on the best places to send your agents... but it is about the -best- places to send them, there are no 'bad choices' that will cause you harm or ruin your game, just choices that are more or less useful.  If you want to play a worker placement game with someone who has never played worker placement before, I would recommend this game.

RATING: 7
A simpel worker placement with some luck, but still nice mechanics. Its more meant for lighter game evenings - and its a perfect game to introduce worker placement. Would tweak some balances in the game, and its a bit too easy to screw with other players. Even though its not one of my favorite worker placement games, I understand why people rate it so high.

RATING: 9.3
The #1 game in my collection of 30 odd games thus far. Can play with only 2, best with 3-4, 5 might be a bit too much as it limits your worker amount. The expansion Scoundrels of Skullport is a must-have and I couldn't imagine playing without it. (Would write a longer review on it some other day since I just joined the site).

I don't get how this is only #45 overall (which you could argue is really high). To me it's one of those overlooked games that needs more attention. I feel that this is a 10/10 game from start to finish and it's our gaming groups favourite too. Every game is so different and I've never had a bad game of Waterdeep with our group. And I doubt that one will never come, it's just that good of a game.

EDIT: 04/17 Dropped from 10 to 9. :( The love is fading. 9 without the expansion, with expansion a lot better.

Oozes atmosphere and the colourful cards sit lovely next to the toned down, brownish pencil board art. It's just great when a game is made so well with such eye-watering attention to detail and production quality.

2016 update: that toned down map-like board art is just smashing. The game is tight as a scotsman the day before dole payment day, too.

Absolutely love this game, which is a favourite in my family. There's enough going on here to keep everyone engaged, the turns are quick, and there's some variety in every game based on buildings put into play and different goal cards. Yet even with various things happening, it's easy to teach. My newly just-turned 6 yr old (who is used to playing a lot of board games) picked it up no problem on her first play through, and managed to finish in second place. Highly recommend this one!

RATING: 9
Wow, after 1 play I really like this game.  Tempted to give it a perfect 10 score because there was nothing I didn't like, but needs a few more plays before that.  It's worker placement like Caylus, Agricola, or Pillars of the Earth, where you choose an action and others are subsequently blocked from that action.  But with all the buildings in play, there are always good options open.  The added dimensions are the Quests and the secret Lord of Waterdeep goal that each player gets.  The secret goal makes it impossible to guarantee the winner until the final points are tallied.  There's a good bit of interaction too, and for a change, the interaction is often acts of benevolence, where you help another player of your choice (as opposed to robbing from him - though that happens also).  It's also fairly simple to learn and doesn't take too long if you can stop players from overanalyzing their moves.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I was talked into trying [i]Waterdeep[/i] based on the advertised 60-minute playtime, only to regret my decision 90 minutes later.  Our game may have been unusual, but there should be an official rule that any game of LoW that lasts longer than an hour should end instantaneously - with everyone losing.

There's no real connection between theme and gameplay, which is most obvious in the fact that [i]Waterdeep[/i] now holds the record for the dullest flavor text of all time. I don't want to violate copyright, so I'll share a few of my own contributions to give you a sense of flavor:

[i]Gee, your licey beard sure looks itchy.

My boots are muddy from the dungeon floor. Please advise.

Cackling witch, please pass the porridge.

Our quest is nearly complete, so prepare to nap shortly.[/i]

Note to Wizards of the Coast: I specialize in narcoleptic prose, and my resume is on its way.

If anyone is still playing this game in a year, I will be absolutely shocked.

RATING: 8
A very good worker placement game in a fantasy setting. Similar to Caylus in that you can buy buildings and get a bonus if others use your buildings. You collect various character cubes (Wizard, Cleric, Rouge, Fighter) as resources to complete quests which give you victory point and sometimes bonuses. A little bit of "take that" player interaction but it tends to just slow you down and not take you out of the game. Good game.

Was and 9. It also was set up on the dinning room table 24/7 (ate in couch for a while... Lol)

But sameness and winners were usually decided by getting that "engine" and it eventually got put away and then traded. 
But it was played more than any game I ever owned, so I definitely got my money's worth out of it, that's for sure!

But after being dissapointed by "The Manhattan Project", I might be leaning toward requiring it. Just to have it in my permanent collection.

I really like this game.  It offers great depth and strategy for a game that is dead simple to set up and learn.  Its also a quick AND satisfying play with decent medium weight strategy mechanics. 

Great components.
Plays great with 2.

I like fantasy themes but I didnt care that the D&D theme was minimal.  It feels like you're playing sneaky bastard rich people who are running a city.  It didnt bother me that it didnt feel like there might be dragons or orcs outside town.

Really fun.

bumping to 9 after plays with more people.  This is very quick to teach but definitely takes more than one play to master.

Back to 8 after noticing imbalance depending on player count.

the expansion is SO good.  it fixes the player count imbalance by introducing new lords.  rating is going back up!

A great intro to worker placement. I generally try and make any fresh meat go through this one (or stone age) at least once before moving them on to something heavier.

Personally after a number of plays it definitely starts to get a bit stale, and while people say the expansion can fix that the already borderline too long play time doesn't need any encouragement from an expansion.

I may be being too harsh, but for it's length there are other things I personally would rather play. However I'm always down to join a game or teach someone this if they're just getting into the hobby :)

There is conflict with other players and you can specifically set out to harm other players but the harm you can do is limited so the game doesn't feel very harsh. More often, you have to choose one other player to *help* and that tends to keep everybody competitive until the end as you will typically help the player who seems weakest. We played with 4 people and our final scores were consecutive - something like 79,80,81,82! Everybody had a chance of winning until the final turn.

One day my win to loss ratio will be better! I've been playing this with my partner every now and then and it's always quite fun - lately we always play with the Skullport expansion. 
It takes a bit of time to set up and it took me a bit of time to get the hang of it, but I really like the theme (yes, I'm one of those) and the art and I find I like the progression of each game with the suspense at the end, when we count the points.

Unfortunately, I have a pretty bad case of "build buildings built on places Oh my I really like buildings" syndrome, which I'm told is not the best attitude to have to score the most points. 

I generally have a bit of an aversion to games that require some forward thinking and strategy, but I really like this one, it was the first worker placement game I've ever played and I do bring it up more often than others when I feel that my partner's board games evenings quota has dropped too low.

RATING: 8.5
Very streamlined game. Good manual and design to help you learn and manage the game easily. Setup is quick.

It's a nice and well balanced worker placement game with a nice fantasy (D&D) theme. Components are nice and the price too. 

It plays very well and the intrigue cards gives it a more surprising gameplay. Also the buildings are a great way to bring variation to the game. 

Played it with 2 and 4 and it's great. This game scales very well. Perfect balance of speed and some complexity. 

It's a bit of a hassle to get everything in the box properly. But i must say, they do seem to stick, even when moving the box. Which can't be said about most other game boxes.

Like Caylus, but with added fun! A truly great worker placement game. The number of components at setup makes you think you're about to embark on a monster, but it plays smoothly and intuitively. Everything glides along with very little downtime.

Lords of Waterdeep is an excellent entry worker placement.  I like the fantasy team of this game a lot because it isn't typical for a euro game. Also, with the expansion added the game adds a lot of variation and much more interesting dynamics and choices.  With the expansion in play the game is rated a little higher for....me probably an 8 or so.

Fantastic gateway game.  Not as "deep" as many other worker placements out there but it's not supposed to be.  Absolutely the kind of game you can get to the table with people who may not be huge Euro (or board game) fans (and the excellent production quality certainly doesn't hurt!).

This is the definitive introductory worker placement game for me. I've often heard it said that the theme is thin but I don't think that's very fair. I may be biased though since I love the forgotten realms universe. This game provides everything I could want in a worker placement game.

I have played this with some competitive gamers and got beaten pretty soundly on both occasions. I like the game and would like to play more often so that I might have the chance of winning this at some point.

Since these early plays I have acquired my own copy and also play on Tabletop Simulator and the IOS app. The game has really grown on me. Most of my plays have been the base game, I find the expansion really blows the doors off and look forward exploring it some more.

I pretty much play exclusively with both the expansion modules now. I really enjoy this game, it's a satisfying game without being too long or too strategically intensive. I can play this on a work night which scores it extra points.

This game is pretty much a simplified version of Caylus.  I enjoyed it greatly!  It is much easier to understand and I like not having to worry about the bailiff or provost the entire time.  The theme is a lot better than Caylus as well.  I'd probably play this more than Caylus because of the simplicity, but Caylus has more strategy involved.

Fun game. I really like the different quests. On the minus side, some intrigue cards seem pointless to play, and I wish there was a couple of action spaces where you could trade resources. A bit slow depending on the players, I wish the game flowed a bit quicker. Overshadowed by Champions of Midgard in my opinion.

I'd played the iOS version a lot before we got this to the table, so it was very quick to get going. Really enjoy this - was a little unsure how well it would work at 2p, but I loved being able to complete more quests. We played with the mandatory quests left in (I have seen a lot of people remove them at 2p) and it didn't cause any issues. I also liked how the Intrigue cards that give you 2 cubes and another player 1 cube work differently at 2p - in a game with more players it feels like a way to catch up to a runaway leader (or just hold them back), whereas at 2p it felt more like price to pay for the benefit of the Intrigue card. Just like using the opponent's buildings, there was a lot of weighing up the options - is the reward worth it if it directly benefits the opponent, too?

D&D is a very strongly flavoured theme, that has been applied to this game very thinly.

This game might very well have portrayed competing Renaissance fresco painters, and I know I'd enjoy it much the same. The theme here doesn't excite or depress me, but I'm sure it will draw in players who otherwise wouldn't touch this style of gameplay with a 10-foot pole.

The city board is nicely illustrated, and functionally arranged. The art on all of the cards is decent.

LoWD plays fast; is simple; a whole bunch of fun; and is complemented by some interesting decision-making - that does not paralyse players with too many 'meh' options.

Feels fairly tight and certainly winnable by all moderate players for much of the game. A very competent design.

Received from Gina for Christmas 2012. Thanks Sister in Law!!!

This is a solid worker placement game.  The resources and actions are tight, it plays quickly and the components are great.  There might be a bit more randomness in the card draws (particularly the usefulness of the hidden roles) than some folks like but trying to find the best time to play intrigue cards or complete a quest was entertaining.  Thematically the game manages to make all the actions and results make sense even if there should be more to adventuring than simply assembling a proper team (though I appreciate there not being an additional layer of randomness added for questing).

Thanks to that nice thematic integration and great art/components combined with engaging game play this is quicly becoming my go to intro Worker Placement game of choice.

For me Lords of Waterdeep seems like the lowest common denominator of defferent kind for games (Euro, Ameritrash, RPG and casual games) - A game that everone can play, but the game isn't that great in it's own right.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is an Euro-game in an Ameritrash packaging. What that does to us? Well we had high expectations of it. Most of the time Euro-games just hacve a theme pasted on, while Ameritrash-games have a great implementation of the theme. Euro-games play fast compared to Ameritrash-games. What if this was a game that plays fast and is able to take you into the theme?

Well, before we ordered this game, we knew that wasn’t going to happen. We read about all the shortcomings on this one. But we also read enough to know, that we would enjoy this game. After we got this game with Christmas, the first surprise was the size of the box. It was huge! We expected a medium sized box, like games of the Alea Big Box series. But the box was even bigger than a TTR-box. When we had a closer look at the box, the first disappointment appeared. The lid of the box didn’t even reach down half-way the box. Ofter opening the lid, I noticed two corners of the box weren’t taped together. Ouch…. Big, big mistake in my eyes. This way there always will be a (very) small opening between the two pieces of cardboard. An opening that makes it possible for dust to get inside the box. Then we looked further and noticed the, high-rated by other people, insert of the box. And indeed, we have to agree with them. This is a very nice designed insert. Everything just fits as it should. Everything is staying in place. This is an example for many games. Only one remark about this insert. At the bottom side of the playing board, in the agents-pool, there is space for a sixth agent. Rules speak about a space for a future expansion. If there was is expansion to come, the space on the game-board only would make sense, if it became possible to play with a sixth player. Why isn’t the insert of the box prepared for that?

Playing and explaining this game is easy. It comes down to place a worker (agent) and perform the action that comes with the placement. After that complete a card (quest) if it’s possible. That’s all there is, collect cubes and use them to get victory points. Oh no, I said that wrong. A player has to hire rogues, fighters, clerics, and wizards to fulfill quests. And that’s the biggest problem of this game. The implementation of the theme is poor. I don’t feel like I have to hire adventures. It’s just collecting colored cubes. The only thing what reminds of the theme while I’m playing the game, is the moment when I look at the boxfront. Why aren’t plastic, ½inch minis inside the box that represent the adventurers? Minis like in the Dungeon Petz box. Why isn’t a bigger miniature inside the box, that represent the different lords? Miniatures like in Claustrophobia? That would be great to the implementation of the theme to this game.

Probably it sounds like we didn’t like the game. In the contrary, we enjoyed this game very much. We liked the mechanism of the intrigue cards. We liked the different buildings that players can build, and the benefits that comes with them for the owner. We like that there become more possibilities to place workers when there are more buildings build. We like the plot quests that can give you benefits during the game. We like the materials that are used. They are of high quality components. Minor thing in game play, is the fact that 8 out of the 9 lords, give you bonus-points for completing quests. We would like to see more variation in that, because there are more ways to collect points in this game.

As said, we enjoyed this game very much. Fantastic family game. Plays great with two (we can set this game up and play it with two in about 45 minutes), and most important, it is fun.

RATING: N/A
My definitive go-to gateway game for introducing the worker placement mechanic. It is not overly complicated, there are simple choices that yield fun rewards. The joy of completing two or three quests in one round is balanced by the horror of watching that last gold-producing location get taken by the preceding player.

Overall, I very much enjoy this. My only critique is that I feel there could have been more creative lords. (This is remedied in the expansion, but is still apparent.)

Currently ALWAYS want to play this. The day we bought this we ended up playing on my back porch till 3AM. Since then we have played maybe a dozen more times. I had never played a worker placement game before but I really love this. It's my wifes favorite game right now and probably my own. Many say the theme is pasted on but we get into it. I motherfucking role play this game! When I complete a quest it's EPIC. Those little wooden blocks? They are my army! I mourn for each one lost and rejoice when a new brother or sister joins me in my cause to rule Waterdeep. Theme is only as deep as the people who play! This game rules you should buy it.

If you're looking for thematic saturation here, ehhhhh….

Fortunately, that's only a bonus for me. This clearly has some ancestry from [thing=18602]Caylus[/thing], whether by design or happenstance, and that is a good thing.  I'm not thrilled by the amount of text one must constantly digest, nor am I delighted by being able to throw "blockers" (Mandatory Quests) at people; however, having to seed action spaces with resources — sorry, "adventurers" (colored cubes) — creates some interesting dynamics.

All in all, not bad!

Another game that started out higher and is working its way down.  There's just not enough THERE in this game and the more I play Dominant Species the more evident the flaws of LoW become.

I should offer a caveat here though.  This is a fabulous introduction to worker placement.  The gateway is open.

Previously had this for trade, but I pulled it back.  Hoping that the expansion adds enough to justify keeping it.  If it's more of the same basic WP, I'll be unloading it in short order.

After 2+ plays: There's not much new here.  It's a fairly bland worker placement where you collect resources and turn them in for points at a pretty set ratio.  Too many of the buildings are just strictly better version of the original spaces, such that they provide only new spaces for when the extra worker comes in the fifth round, not new interesting options.  The mechanism for playing intrigue cards is also neat, but the cards themselves are mostly bland - either a generic turn-saving action or thoughtless take-that.  

After 5+ plays: My opinion is slightly improved.  Some plot quests can add a nice twist, and I've discovered the game is significantly better with 2-3 players than with 4-5.  Bumping rating up from a 5 to a 6.

I played this wrong the first several games, but after I learned the actual rules I preferred my incorrect play method. This is a theme-heavy worker placement game about completing quests. That's an awesome concept and it is fun to play, with a low barrier to entry. The main problem is that the largest quests are easily identifiable as the best reward-to-cube ratio, regardless of which leader you have. If you are dealt a 25 pt quest at the start, you have a large advantage.

To mitigate this imbalance, we play without any starting quests. If you want a 25 pt one that is sitting on the table, you'll need to spend an action and your privilege of access to the favoured buildings in order to get it.

Despite that minor issue, Waterdeep is a great game, and one of my preferred worker placement options.

This game has been said to be too simple, too light. It is certainly not a heavy rules game, and it is certainly not difficult to grasp. However, there is considerable depth and just amazing replay value here. I can play it 100 times and I'd probably end up seeing a different strategy unfold over the 8 turns. At the start of the game, you're open - do whatever you want. By round 3, you have a couple of strategies to attack...by round 7 you're clearly set on one and you have to attack, attack, attack on those quests to fulfill your need for victory. I love this game. My wife and I played it twice in the first day, can't wait to get it to the table again. Just a beautifully designed, wonderful components and thematically interesting worker placement game. It's above Dungeon Lords only because this is shorter and easier to set up and put away. Has the best insert ever made, as well. Definitely a 10!

Very boring and highly overrated.  I've only played it once, so give that whatever weight you wish.  It was a three-player game and, without knowing the rules, I could sit down and competently play.  So, it's a "been there, done that" sort of game in the worst way.  

If I had to pick a redeeming feature, it's that it might serve well as a gateway game.  But, at the same time, why bore new players?  Why not introduce them to gaming via a better, more delightful game?

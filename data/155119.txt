GAME: Mars Attacks: The Dice Game
RANK: 4921
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As a fan of zombie dice as a filler, this one serves the same function while being a stronger game. This is an extremely light almost pure chance game that is really meant to be played between long games. For this purpose, it is wonderful. It does have one flaw (runaway winners), but given that the game is so short, that's very forgivable.

Not much to the game, but it's pleasant.  I expected the press-your-luck element to be greater, but the decisions were fairly simple.  It was odd how little variation there was in the licensed art.

Picked it up last night.  My girl friend and I sat down for 2rounds.  Not too bad with 2.  I can see this better with 4 and chaos with 6.  
I' never played Zombie Dice.  Watched it, looks fun and u see a lot if that in MA Dice.  With a great movie for the theme.  I wish the artwork was more visable, but quick games makes that a moot point.  I'd recommend it, quick goofy push your luck fun.  Nice quality parts for a small box.  Good bang for the buck.

RATING: 3
Complete waste of time, but at least it's quick enough that you don't waste a lot of it.

If the nuke level is 4 or below, you roll once and either bomb out immediately or score whatever you rolled.  If it's 7 or above, nuking out is completely irrelevant since that means you only scored a couple points by definition.

Either way, there are zero decisions to make 80% of the time.

RATING: 7.5
Solid, fun dice game, even if I wasn't a fan of the film it was based on. Slightly variable setups based on what cards come out when, or what cards are even IN the game. You're rolling dice with three symbols to match target cards, but there's constantly the threat of you being nuked to lose your turn. Some cards also have powers or conditions and that spices up the gameplay quite a lot. Be warned that because you are targeting BEFORE rolling your dice, there can be a lot of frustrating turns, especially with the nukes looming over you. So it's push your luck to the max, and thus better suited to a group of players that just wants to roll dice and have fun than more serious strategy gamers who will throw a hissy fit every time a turn is wasted.

Fun little push your luck dice game. Super easy to teach and play. We played it twice (3 player) game in about 25 minutes total. We added more cards to each stack for our second game. There is a nice mechanic with the nuke symbols. The level changes based on the cards that are out. This is a keeper!

Mars Attacks is what Zombie Dice could have been but failed to be: a fun filler with a pinch of strategy, as the stacked city and monument cards are likely to vary from game to game and to reward different playstyles as well as risk propensity.

OK, so there's a little bit of game here; but fundamentally, it's just push-your-luck dice-rolling. Nothing wrong with that in the right group and at the right time, of course. And there are a couple of meaningful decisions when the piles get smaller. But overall, I'd rather play something meatier.

Great filler!  Similar to Age of War / Risk Express, but with special powers and lots of target variety to spice things up.

RATING: 3
This is a 3-6 player game. It does not play very well with two. One issue with the game is that when there are only four nuke spaces out you basically are rolling only once.  You either nuked out or odds are stacked against you on a second roll. It loses any push your luck sense. Odds are too easy to calculate with all the dice being the same. It might have been better with some imbalance like the those in Zombie Dice.

This is a nice, light-weight dice game that has a good push-your-luck element.  The theme is very good and the artwork on the cards is well done. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Warning: There are only 4 different versions of artwork on the cards.  I had not researched the game on BGG; I bought it based on the box artwork, and the phrase "[game] based on the Mars Attacks trading cards by Topps". So, I was expecting to have lots of "Mars Attacks" Topps artwork on the cards.

This is basically a dice-fest with an irreverent theme.  It give you a 20 min excuse to yell "Ack-ack-ack..."  There is a little bit of strategy with where you attack, based on opponents and your position.  But at its heart (if that can be said) it is a push your luck probability game.

Mars Attacks: The Dice Game was a game I was looking forward to if only for rolling dice.  It's a thing I enjoy.  Mars Attacks does a good job of taking the simplicity of rolling dice and turning it into a fun, little game.  I really like the theme (pasted on as it is) and feel it blends well with the actions of the players throughout play.  In summary, this is a good one.

Truly underwhelming. There's very little to do here, and not much in the way of mitigating the randomness of the dice rolls. The "hard" variation is--has to be--slightly better than the "easy" variation, where it's hard to even roll oneself out of a turn by getting too many nukes.

This is a veritable golden age of dice games. Do yourself a favor and play something else. I'm no huge fan of Smash Up, but it's a significantly better take on the same premise.

It's an okay push your luck game, my biggest problem with it is that I think it ends too early. And I think even on the hard setting, there isn't a whole lot of reason to push your luck until right at the end. You can be really safe a lot of the time and still make great progress, the only reason the really press yourself are for monuments (which are garbage compared to cities) and to try and stop a win.

I rate this game a 7, but I can see where people would rate it a 6.  For me, the theme pushes it up to 7.  I loved the movie, and this game gives me that nostalgia feeling I like.

A surprisingly charming little roll-off.  I think it takes what is fun about Age of War or Risk Express and takes out some of the screwage.  The component quality originally turned me off (the location cards are pretty thin), but after playing, I'm kind of glad they went that way...it allows for more cities to be included in the box.  
Overall, I enjoy it.  It's a solid, fast-playing game with a bit of push-your-luck, and a cool theme.

A perfectly fine filler game in the press your luck vein. The game is functional and enjoyable, partly due to having to roll ten dice at once. Super simple, in all the ways you'd like, and the game wraps up pretty quick. Good if you need filler, but if you're looking for a heartier game with similar mechanics, hit up press your luck or something similar.

Mep mep mep MEP MEP MEP! Allow me to translate. This is a simple game of rolling dice to collect cards in the form of cities or monuments. Cities require players to roll a set number of ray guns, while monuments require martians. Players can only reroll martian symbols, but if those pesky humans nuke you (meaning you've rolled too many nuke symbols) before claiming a card or stopping, then your turn ends immediately. Dice rolls can be saved by placing a marker on the target card and attempting to claim it on a future turn.  Some cards have ongoing or one-time special abilities. Game is probably best with 4 or more players.

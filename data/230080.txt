Easy to play.
This hasn't grabbed me like Century: Spice Road or Splendor. At this point I think those are both far superior but can be used as a gateway. Far better with 4 and would personally not recommend this for two.

Played at SHUX Con.  The coins are the best part of the game, really.  It's a mediocre abstract set collections game.  Plays fast and light, and is a little fun, but I wouldn't care of I never played it again.  Didn't grab me like Splendor which I have played many times.  And I found the soldier cards, which can drastically destroy your board, to be pretty irritating.  Overall, not bad but not that memorable either.

RATING: 7.5
It has a very easy appeal and glorious components. Fishing through the scoring chips is satisfying. The combo of cards are fun and there are some interesting decision in choosing when to go for certain cards. Scoring remains close throughout although it does amount to a race game and optimal scoring decisions take time. I like it quite a bit for what it is.

I saw Majesty for the first time at the Spiel and it intrigued me immediately. The artwork was really pretty and the poker chips looked very nice. I was surprised to see Hans im Glück put out a game like this, because this production looks far more French than German.

The game-play is incredibly simple. You pick 12 cards in the course of the game. Just you're trying to pick them in a way that they produce you more money than the other players. The first time I played it I was actually a bit underwhelmed by its simplicity, but the game has been growing on me since then. It's actually a great little filler with a good amount of replayability thanks to the B side of the town cards.

There's not much more to say. It's not a game that offers a great depth of game-play, but it's one that can be played easily by anyone and one that you can play in 20 minutes. I see this game getting a lot of plays in the time to come... and who knows, maybe an expansion will come out to spice things up a little bit.

It is quick and easy, and kind of breezy (other than the knight cards), though it has a fair amount of "chip-keeping" in terms of distributing the correct number of chips to all the players their tableaus are "rung" on other player's turns.  Who has a Miller? That sort of thing.  All in all, this game is pleasant enough, but for my tastes, not particularly a top choice for a filler.  On the other hand, one could do much worse than this game as a filler.

A neat but short little card selection game that offers a fair amount of interaction; what other players do may trigger payouts for you if you meet certain conditions and players may kill off some of your characters through indirect attacks. There some interesting player here with 4 players but I feel like the game would completely lose its appeal with 2 as most of that interaction would be stripped away.

Majesty is a good, short, easy to play game. It moves along at the pace of a game like Splendor or Century Spice Road, but it has more going on. Players take turns selecting a card from the line of 5 each turn. Cards next to the deck are expensive and cards far from the deck are cheap. You pay with workers on the cards further from the deck than the one you're buying and pick up workers off the card when you grab one that already has workers (like Century: Spice Road).

Each card causes something to happen depending on if you are playing the A or B side of that area. Each type of card often gets more rewarding as you get more of them and you score a good chunk of points at the end for having the most of one type. For example, the Innkeeper scores you points for all of your Innkeepers and bonus points for anyone playing who has a Brewer. There are A and B sides to all areas, so plenty of opportunity for tweaking the combos between plays.

I am very pleasantly surprised by how well this game works and how it scales from 2-4 players. It works as a quality family game and gamers who like light games will probably enjoy it. It's from the same designer as Splendor, which I didn't care for, and this does have similar (though smaller) quality plastic coins.

I have always liked the mechanism where you can skip ahead in a line of "stuff" like small world, and it works well here too.  The game is fun, but I do wonder how many plays it has in it before it gets stale.  Even mixing up the A and B sides doesn't seem like enough to keep this one around for long.  Seems like it needs expansions. but with the way the engine works, this doesn't seem all that easy to expand.  I have only played 3 players so far, but I think how much I like the 2 player will determine if its a keeper or not.  Since everyone compares this to Century: Spice Road and Splendor, at this point I would say those games are better than this one.

Different from Splendor. A lot of people since it's the same designer compare it to that. I find it puzzley thinky game( Which i love) Card driven with special powers derived from placement on one of the properties. A bit of take that with Military. however not punishing. Only last 20-30 min. 12 turns only over before you know it. Wish there might have been more turns or one or two more turns but good where it stands.

A nice, simple, card drafting game, where the cards interact in interesting ways. I'm not really sure how to describe the game; there's a bit of engine building in that certain cards score for having certain other cards, but you also want a good breadth of cards for scoring purposes.

The only drawback is that I feel the game plays the players a little more than the players play the game. You're fairly limited to what's available when your turn rolls around, and sometimes the choices are rather obvious.

Still, a neat game, definitely in the vein of games that are satisfying for gamers, but still approachable.

Quick card tableau building game that's all about scoring points, and the points are nice plastic poker chips.

Another fast playing micro game from the designer of Splendor. It feels like a combination of Splendor and Century. Its simpler than both of those as you're simply drafting 12 cards and then the game ends. While drafting more cards of the same type scores you more points during the game as the effect is multiplied, you'll score less at the end of the game due to the variety scoring in place. For these reasons it's hard to say that you are building an engine in this one like Century or Splendor, which I think hurts it a little bit. I'd be curious to try this with more than two to see if some of the card powers become more valuable, but if it doesn't I fear it may always be overlooked in favor of the other two games I have mentioned.

RATING: 5
Simple and straightforward card game; immediate appreciation because it is just nice to see the old Vinci / Small World / Firenze-mechanism implemented in a game of this day and age. It's rock solid and very dependable, and I've always wondered why no more games are using it. That said, the game works through a bit of minor combo'ing, and this introduces strong left-right binding between players which tends to dampen the strategic potential to some extent. You tend to play what the others don't. On the other hand, the game only lasts for 20 minutes and has a quick and pleasing playing rythm. Not too shabby.

If I were to suggest improvements, they would be in the form of adapting the combos for the card categories. You can do all sorts of wonkiness here. It reminds me a bit of Imhotep in this regard: these games are both simple as well as versatile enough to support such extensions.

[i]Update[/i] I've played a number of times with the A-side of the character cards now, and notice disturbing balance patterns. Someone who happens to uniquely obtain lots of princesses is bound to end up very high on the scoring ladder. The only thing stopping such a strategy is someone else collecting the damsels too... but that's not always possible. It is very hard to defend against this event, and sours me on the game as a whole. That's not to say other means of victory are not possible: I've won, again through sheer luck in how the cards turned out, by grabbing all knights. 'Sheer luck' really isn't something I like to see in this game, even if it is short. In the groups I frequent talk is now to move on to the B-side which supposedly gives everyone a much better chance at winning. I'm curious to see how this plays out.

In Majesty, you are assembling a medieval village, drafting millers, witches, noblemen, soldiers in the like.  Each character you draft will grant you some number of victory points based on your tableau, and some will have other effects as well (such as killing people in other people's villages).  Final scoring is based on set collection - who has the most of each kind of hero, and how many different kinds of heroes you've collected.

Key Mechanic: Spending to Dig.  Acquiring citizens is simple - players choose from a tableau of six cards.  The card on the end is free to draft, but the next one costs one meeple - placed on the card.  If you want the sixth card, you will need to place all five meeples to get it.  Players who draft one of the other cares in the future also claim all the meeples on it.

Players start with, and can never have, more than five meeples, meaning that if you dig for a card, you're limiting your options in the following turns pretty sharply.  This sort of mechanic is fairly common as a minor mechanic in many other games, but works well as the central driving engine of Majesty.  

Majesty is short game by the designer of Splendor (a reasonably good game that doesn't make this list), and is a solid game with good components that is great filler in between bigger fare.

Players have an identical realm consisting of 8 cards, each representing a different building. Each building has a specific colour. Players have to place cards (inhabitants) of the same colour in each building. On their turn they take the leftmost card from a display of 6 cards, or buy a card more to the right by placing meeples on the cards. Each player has a maximum stock of 5 meeples. When taking a card containing meeples the player can put these in their stock. Every time a card is placed in a building points are scored and depending on the building other actions are taken. Final scoring depends on majorities per colour and the number of different colours a player collected.

Harmless card drafter.  Spend twelve turns grabbing a card and adding it to your kingdom, gaining points.  At the end of the game, add in the square of the diversity, and points for majorities at locations.  Very simple - possibly too simple, but a nice, overpriced, distraction for ten minutes.  Take away the overdone scoring chips, and replace meeples with cubes, and this could fit into a compact card game box.

I wanted to like this game more than I did. It is beautiful but the gameplay is quite loose and you don't see much a connection in real time between your actions and your victory points or your chance of winning (at least in comparison to Splendor, from the same designer, which was race to 15 points and you could see your chances building up as you play). As consequence the gameplay feels pleasant but does not create enough tension to make me want to play again and try something new... Also, small thing, I hate the whole "slide the leftover cards to the left after you buy a card from the table" - It means you have to be constantly reorganizing the table.

Splendor-like filler with admin issues.

[thing=230080][/thing] has been touted as a new Splendor-like filler, and with Hans Im Gluk on board as publishers the signs were good.  Sadly the game is a bit too fiddley in the admin department to really work.  You are constantly shifting cards along the line of the central card pool, and on every fast turn you are calculating how much cash you get and seeking to get the change from the bank. And some cards mean everyone is taking small coins on each turn and changing big coins for small - so there are often many fingers in the bank trying to get change at the same time. It is the sort of game which would work well as an app to take care of all the admin.

It's good for what it is -- a quick filler with interesting decisions. Drop a quarter and play another if you don't like how that one went. What I'm not sure about yet is that in our games so far, the winner was identified mid-game and the rest was just playing it out. Seems as if someone gets something powerful going, you can try and stop them but are at the mercy of how the cards come out and may not be able. Perhaps we'll get better at playing defense with more plays. 

I prefer Splendor (but this one certainly is quicker for when that's appropriate).

Very solid game but it lacks Splendor depth for sure. The paradox is that Majesty is balanced more than enough. You score points for everything and with scores around 250 points with 2 players I can not reject the feeling that the winner was determined by the card draw rather than how we played. Nevertheless it is smooth and fun as a filler. B side of cards highly recommended!

MAJESTY ist für mich ein Einerseits-Andererseits. Zunächst einmal gefiel es mir besser als ich vermutet hatte, obwohl es das simple Mainstream-Sammelkartenanlegespiel ist, als das es sich lackgebürstet anbietet. Rein spielerisch schimmert die SPLENDOR-Handschrift deutlich hindurch: Mann, sind die Taler Dickmann! Die fetten Münzen schmecken nach Autorenhaptik-SPLENDOR-Selbstzitat, riechen aber hinter ihrem handschmeichelndem Glanz als Preistreiber einer Gewinnkalkulation, um den in Materialrelation happigen Verkaufspreis zu rechtfertigen. Denn ohne dicke Taler und die 90er Jahre Wiederkehr des Schachtelluft kompensierenden schwarzen Plastik-Inlays sinkt MAJESTY materialmässig als preisgünstiges Kartenspiel in sich zusammen. Und hier hört man schon den deutlich den Marketingschrei des Verlags. MAJESTY ist doch arg Produkt und "marktgemacht". Man merkt dem Spiel an, wo es hin will. Die Hochglanzschachtel macht keinen Hehl aus ihrer Absicht. Die ökonomische Motivation hat natürlich mit dem Spieldesign selbst nichts zu tun, lässt MAJESTY am Ende des Tages aber halt nicht viel Seele und Identität. Darüber hinaus spielt sich MAJESTY sauber, eloquent, geschmeidig glatt und geschliffen wie seine Verpackung und angenehm schnell. Fast Food in High End. So richtig will man dem gemachten Ding den roten Pöppel nicht wünschen, auch wenn das Spiel flufft wie Sahneschaum und die Karten französisch hübsch und räumlich delikat aussehen. Die redaktionelle Professionalität von HiG bleibt weiter ein Faustpfand, auch wenn sie sich seit dem Geniestreich MARCO POLO mehr in Richtung Absatzzahlen geneigt hat. Ist dies schon ein Merkmal des Generationenwechsels bei HiG? Oder einfach nur Zufall einer Reihe von Bauchentscheidungen für bestimmte Spiele? Thesenpapier: Der Kontext macht die Musik: ob man mit einer guten Idee/Vision (hier: Spiel) Geld verdient oder primär nur Geld verdienen will und dafür eine Idee (hier: Spiel) verwendet, macht den Unterschied für Herz und Seele. So oder so: HiG ist im modernen Warenverkauf angekommen. MAJESTY ist Brettspielmarkt 3.0.

INITIAL IMPRESSION
Cool light tableau building game. Components and Art are awesome. The mechanics are easy to grasp

We played 3p but I think the game probably needs 4p to create more tension when it comes to Majorities. I think breaking Ties favorably is a bit too soft handed in this game

I question if this game has the replayability of other gateways as I think the A/B side varience isn't high enough and most of the builds operate in a pretty simple fashion. It is however much faster (20-30min) than other gateways, seems like a filler almost. Ultimately that will determine if this is a 6 or 7 for me

It feels like it tries to find its place between Splendor and Century, but fails drastically in its mechanics.

It seems to present the least of both games, unable to present a real tension between players. The racing aspect is completely lost, which was to my eyes a major fun factor for the two formers.

Although the aesthetics and the tactile experience is very cool, I don't think it presents something interesting enough to become unique and leave its mark.

RATING: 7
When taking the material out of the box, it becomes clear that Majesty wants to be an alternative to Splendor and Century. Heavy plastic coins pimp the game, rules are simple, each turn is quick with a player taking one card from a row and executing the effects. After twelve turns, majorities and variety are scored.

Difficult to say where this fits in compared to its peers. The novelty factor speaks for Majesty. I only own Splendor but I want to play all three games consecutively to get a better comparison.

Nice production of an easy to learn, fast playing game.  You only get 12 cards in the game so every choice is extremely important.  Pick a strategy and try to stick to your game plan, but keep an eye open for opportunities to block the other players.

[PNP] Very streamlined game that flows beautifully. The idea is simple yet the cards out on the line really changes how you play. There are different strategies and all seem viable. Artwork is beautiful and icons are clear most of the time. Really good game. Like it nearly the same as Splendor which means it is pretty good.

2017-11-25 - 6.5 - Short, smooth, nice working tableau building game. I'm not a fan of this kind of negative interaction though (opponents lose a card if not protected enough), but it's not too annoying as you might always get your card back by playing a witch. 
I won't oppose playing it. Better than Splendor.

Played once, won with 190 (the 3 others, real gamers, had about 145 each). Never looked back. 
In essence: no soul, no depth, just random convoluted crap, there is interaction but of a very shallow kind.

There are no denominations of "5", constant need for changing denominations, the coins are a bad quality rip-off from Splendor.
Game designers that took the Action selection track idea from others but didn't understand it but threw it in anyway. 
Obviously not playtested, not thought through, unacceptable anno 2018.
Avoid like the plague.

Fast and simple game. This is a lightweight game, which is easy to learn and quite straight-forward to play. One game takes at most 20 minutes, which is great. And look at those components! Works best with three or four players, there is no reason to play it with 2. The biggest issue here is the end game scoring which is a bit dull AND that part desperately needs some hidden information. So yes, ready to play it every now and then, but no need to own it.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I'm happy to play someone else's copy if asked. Found it more interesting than expected but think it would get repetitive pretty quickly if played frequently Even with A/B sides, it only changes so much. The attack element can be annoying but can be worked around to some degree.

I had high hopes for Majesty: For the Realm after reading some great reviews. Played it a few weeks ago. The game owner loves it, but I found myself looking in the box wondering where the rest of the game was. To be fair, we only had time to play the A side of the cards, so maybe there's more going on with the B side? The choices were obvious and I was bored while playing. Splendor is waaaaay better. I'll give the B side a chance if the opportunity arises, but I took Majesty off my wishlist right away once I got home.

I love the way this game looks! I saw it on the table and bought it mostly because of that. It's not as complex as I would like, but it does offer a decent amount of strategy for a 20 minute game. It's a fun light game and it's really solid as a filler.

In a longer game, I would find Majesty For the Realm's two-dimensional set collection and Small World-esque drafting dull and soulless. However, the novelty of these mechanisms don't wear off before the game is over.

The options for different actions for different colors also presumably would keep this game fresh for a decent amount of plays.

Un jeu entre Splendor et Century, avec des personnages à pouvoir, par l'auteur de Splendor. C'est rapide, très simple, mais avec plus de hasard que dans les 2 précités (ou du moins, ou le hasard a plus - trop - d'importance dans l'issue de la partie). J'aime bien, sans plus.
Là où Splendor et Century peuvent cohabiter sans soucis dans la même ludothèque, le problème se pose avec Majesty si on possède déjà l'un ou l'autre.

RATING: 6.75
Has some small similarities to Splendor & Spice road.
Each player has a village with the same location - Each location triggers when you put a character into it and scores points. Each round you take a card (character) from the array and place it in you village - (the miller would go to the mill, knight to the barracks etc etc)

you score as you go along and after each player has taken 12 cards the game ends - There are also points for having the most type of character in each location and theres a bonus for having a character in as many different locations as possible


The componants are good the artwork is good. A simple quick alternative to splendour , spice road and king dommino 

nothing special but playable

Nothing wrong with fillers in general, but in this case take the extra 10-15 minutes and play Spice Road instead.  Or play Cacao, Sushi Go, etc.

Maybe playing with a mix other than just A-side cards will make the game more interesting. As is, it's very bland, but at least it's over quickly.

Quick and smooth playing cardgame. Highly interactive, some people might get hurt, but I enjoyed it. You get loads of points, all handed out in solid chits. However, a scoretrack would have been so much easier to play. We had to change continuously as in a four player game, points chits were scarce in the smaller denominations.

Lightweight game that plays as fast as the speed of light. It's a nice tableau builder with a set collection element and some power-up Deus-like combo's combined with Century Spice Road buying of cards. Nice filler-like game with a race element. My kids ages 5& 7 can already play this along. Only negative I can think of is the constant swapping of coins with the bank. And why aren't there any coins of 5?

Just more fluff in an already crowded market. Draft cards with a touch of Small World resource management. Gave me all the same dull feelings as Machi Koro. I think that if another game came along and did what Valeria did to Machi Koro, however, there could be potential with this design.

PROs: Simple and easy to teach! Can be used as a gateway game. I can teach this game without looking at the rules in under 5 minutes. The iconography is good and I'm able to have all new players understand those and thus remember the game rules. The game is also very pretty with nice artwork and good components.

CONs: While not the end of the world, everyone wishes they would have done a better job with coin denominations and included a 5. But if you go into the game knowing there aren't any 5's, then you adjust your thinking on making change.

[b]Majesty: For the Realm[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I was really looking forward to playing Majesty: For the Realm just to see where it rated among the Marc Andre games I've played. I own and love Barony, but really don't care for Splendor. As with all the games designed by Andre your turns are lightning quick, but the impact on the outcome of the game is huge especially since you will only take twelve actions during a game of Majesty. Because of this, turns are quick and the game plays fast, but you still feel like you had meaningful decisions to make. And your decisions will directly impact other players, whether directly or indirectly. 

The rules are easily taught in Majesty; it is a set collection game with the added twist of each type of card being associated with a building in your tableau. Each building scores differently during the game and then you are going to score points for having the majority of cards at each building. You also have a set of meeples which are used to secure cards further down the line of available cards you can draft [i](the same mechanic is used in Century: Spice Road and Firenze).[/i]

I enjoyed Majesty much more than Splendor, but Barony is still my favorite Marc Andre game. While Majesty doesn't have the depth of Barony, the quick playtime combined with the variety of ways you can build your tableau while having to pay attention to your opponents made this a winner and definitely a game I'll be adding to my collection.[/i]

In this game, there is a conveyor belt of cards. Players take turns buying one of the cards, then adding the card they bought to that card's matching building and then activating the ability of the building, which tends to give a better effect the more cards you've stacked under it. This creates some nice tension with the endgame scoring process, where you get points based on how many different buildings you put cards under. The game part of the game is you get a special budget of meeples that you can use to take a card further up the belt, but when you do so you money-up the cards you skipped over. There's also a type of card that attacks other players for not having gotten defense cards, so you need to keep an eye on what other players are going for in that respect at least. This is a nice, light game. One of the things I find most compelling is the way the game keeps you attuned to what other players are up to by offering another end game scoring criteria which is a majority calculation for each type of cards. Good overall, great for a quick meaty filler.

Fast and straightforward point-salad game based upon a beloved drafting mechanism. As such it is a promising filler/starter game and combo types and complexity are just fine for this sort of game, but I had expected more from it. 

Turns follow each other very rapidly, rendering upkeep of the card row half of the work here (and sadly it often feels like actual work). Constant changing of coins (for score keeping purposes only) doesn't help with that. Since scoring is mostly incremental, use of personal scoreboards would have been a far better choice, especially given the absence of the much needed 5 value coins.

RATING: 6
A fairly fun filler game with a rather deep rules complexity for its playing time. Players draft characters for their kingdom by paying to skip over characters (ala Small World), then place those characters under the corresponding areas of the personal tableau. Much like in Deus, placing a character in a column triggers all the previously placed characters there.

There's a fair bit of interaction in the game, primarily through the knights which attack all opponents. Certain characters also trigger the tableaus of others, and it can get a little messy as coins are constantly being taken and swapped out from the supply. It's a great diversion which fits in line with games like Machi Koro.

Nekem egyértelműen a Fűszerút jutott eszembe a játék szabálymagyarázatakor és maga játékmenet is hasonló. Itt a birodalmunkba szerzünk jómunkásembereket, akik pontot hoznak. A jóemberek megszerzése a Fűszerút mechanikáját követi, a 6 felcsapott emberből az első ingyenes, a többiért egy-egy szolgánkat (mindenki 5-el kezd) kell beáldozni, úgy hogy a kiválasztott jóember előtti emberekre helyezünk egyet-egyet belőlük. Ha olyat veszünk el, amin szolgák vannak, akkor azokkal feltölthetjük az 5-ös helyünk, ha már hiányozni, minden 5-ön felüliért pedig 2 pontot kapunk. A megszerzett alattvalók a 7 különböző házaink alá kerülnek és halmozódhatnak. A játék végén még pontot kapunk egyesével minden házat végignézve a többségért és hatványozottan aszerint, hogy mennyi házunkban vannak alattvalók, azaz mennyi fajta van belőlük. A játék gyors, de még a Fűszerútnál is egyértelműbb, könnyedebb egy picivel.
Ugyanannyi pontot is adok rá.

{Medieval; card-drafting, set-collection; optimal 4p} Majesty: For the Realm is an enjoyable filler. The components are nicely made (actually over-produced). Player interaction is very good with nice replayability. There is a balance between luck and tactical move. A turn typically runs fast. It's just tedious to get score tokens each time.

The rule is easy and intuitive. Set up is quite easy.

The card are colourful with nice illustration. The tokens are handy. The game can be made much cheaper with a deck of cards and cubes only. Therefore, this game is expensive for what it provides; however, I am lucky to find a fair price second hand.

Plays quick but still with interesting decisions.  Feels like a faster moving, shorter game time, 7 Wonders.  Can't understand why they didn't include 5 value chips.

Lukewarm about this game. Hits the same spot as Splendor and Spice Road: very easy to teach, very easy to play, very easy to forget.

There is simply not enough oompfh in those type of games to have me come back for more. No shining moments, it just flows along. "Pastime" games is what I call them: nice to play, but nowhere there is real excitement. 

Which makes them very family friendly and good gateway games as there are no real bummers either, but I like my games to have more actual Spice.

tl;dr: the next [thing=148228][/thing]/[thing=209685][/thing]

I played a card game where you strategically use cards and gain plastic, over produced chips. It plays quite fast and has easy, well developed rules. But enough about [thing=148228][/thing]... Boom goes the dynamite!
Anyhow, I can see why people are comparing this to Splendor and Century. It's a similar complexity and play time. It's all about using a limited amount of variables but combining them in such a way the players get meaningful choices and a number of different strategies to explore.
I'm not sure how huge the replay value is, but this certainly is a fun game that is easy to get to the table.

Initial rating: 7/10
BGG scale: 7/10

There was a lot to like here, with the quick play, attractive presentation, the chips but the first play was a steamroller where military crushed everything else.  I'm  sure there are ways to mitigate with more experience so I'd like to play it again.

Very fast, very good graphics, simple and immediate to explain. Totally different from Splendor, but they need my opinion at least as good. It's a light game, you don't have complete control, but you need to do important choices that can make the difference between winning or losing.
One play has make me wanting more and the evening ends with 4 plays in a row. I prefer by far side B. 

In my collection, it will be played very often.

Majesty has the potential to become my favorite filler because it has a great ratio of strategy to complexity.  While in many ways similar to Splendor, I've always felt that Splendor is largely about hoping that the right card comes out at the right time.  That is somewhat true in Majesty, but you have to pay a lot to get a newly-revealed card.  Majesty also has a lot in common with Century: Spice Road, but Spice Road is a lot more complicated and hard to grasp on the first play.  I appreciate that the actions are so simple (take exactly 1 card) and the end game is so well defined (after 12 cards).

It's pretty hard for a filler to make it into my collection these days, but Majesty has a chance.  I only wish it had a slightly smaller box so it could fit alongside Sushi Go, No Thanks, etc.

Majesty: For the Realm is a pleasant game.  It's easy to teach, easy on the eyes, and comes with no tough decisions.  This game was polished just past the point of being compelling, but there's nothing wrong with it.

Nice and simple area majority game (and too light for my taste), It will be compared to Splendor a lot, but it is a very different game (but on the same level of complexity). It is a bit more "transparent" and "clean" than Splendor.

RATING: 8
This is what I like in a game: elegant, fast-playing, and enough strategy to keep you engaged.

The game is just a few cards, VP tokens, and meeples, so it's easy to set up and start playing. The gameplay has some similarity to another great elegant game, Century. On a turn you just take one action by taking cards from a row. The first card is free, and you have to leave a trail of meeples if you want to dig deeper.

I will say that the game is overpriced and in too big of a box. Like Splendor, they try to cover this up with over-the-top production (the VP tokens are a plastic poker-chip type material). It's a nice production, but too much for what is ultimately a filler.

Overall I'm really liking it so far.

More than meets the eye....  If you have not played this game at least 5 times, either don;t rate it, or go back and re-rate it, as the first few plays, it's like.... "Okay that's it...?"  And then you play more, and you play the B side of the cards... and ah then it opens up.  This game is also really best with 3.  2 makes some strategies and majorities not so difficult, (Although the game is still fun), 4 hard to control the variables as the cards move down the line.  This game is quick to teach, and fun to play.  Bring on the expansions.... I know they are coming...

I've really warmed to this design, it feels like Marc Andre finally got a good balance of speed to tactical considerations to weight, and the game hums along like no other. I still need to try the other sides of the cards!

RATING: 9
For a simple game, this is a lot of fun!  It's quick and quite simple to teach, but there is more depth than it appears.  In some ways it feels like a lighter version of the Valeria games.  I've seen it compared to Splendor but really wouldn't compare them other than  to say they're both excellent gateway games.  I'd still choose Splendor as a first "modern" game because it's less thematic, but this could easily follow next in line with Century: Spice Road or Ticket to Ride as a third.  For the less casual gamer, there's enough subtle strategy involved to make it an excellent filler at any player count.

Smooth, fast and easy to learn!  There are a couple of competing priorities, which deepens the game without complicating it!  The soft "take that" Barracks cards makes it interesting and makes you think twice about your choice of cards.  It fits within the Century Spice Road and Splendor genre, but it is sufficiently unique to share shelf space without fear of collecting dust.

Medieval card drafting villagers of different occupations from a central cascading display onto identical personal tableau locations that activate abilities with take that, creating meeples and scoring.

RATING: 8
So smooth. The interplay between the immediate card action scoring, the majority scoring, the variety scoring and what other players are drafting/gunning for is great. I like majority scoring, I like set collection, and drafting is fun too. The teeth added with the attack cards adds another wrinkle and challenge, so does the choice of how many meeples to spend to get the card you want, leaving you with no options next time. And all that in 20 minutes. A remarkable achievement, it's getting a lot of play for me at lunch because it's so short and punchy.

RATING: 7.7
Easy to learn set collection with a hint of take that mechanic. If you like 7 Wonders, you'll probably enjoy this one too, don't know how it compares to Splendor since I've never played it. So yes, quite liked this one, the tokens are nice as is the art too and the mechanics are solid and easy to learn. Tried one 4p game which I won with the heavy army strategy.

This could use an expansion somewhere along the road, I'd except the game to feel the same after only a few plays, even with the A-B sides.

Felt like a lot of luck of the draw with somewhat limited decisions and a little bit of nasty mixed in. While the artwork and components were top notch, the gameplay just wasn’t interesting. It’s saving grace is the playtime which bumps it up slightly as if someone really wanted to play, it’s not a huge time commitment.

Initial solo rules playthrough thoughts:
- Plays (too?) fast, 12 rounds only.
- Gorgeous artwork.
- Interesting player interaction, reminds me of Dominion.
- Weird VP denomination. No 5s?
- Insert seems larger than necessary.

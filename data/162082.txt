We only have one play under our belt but we thought it was really fun the way the cards stack and become a "program" of cascading actions that build on each other. The whole game I thought I wasn't doing very well but I had gathered quite a lot of resources and the right cards that made those resources worth quite a bit at the end and I think I won. (It's been a while.) Being able to do well in a game always gives it a ratings boost.

Love the high level of decision and strategy for the low level of complexity.  Also really enjoy the card combinations and the card stacking mechanism.  That said, I never really feel like I get an awesome engine going by the time the game is over.  Not even times to trigger each stack, but I wouldn't want the game to go longer.

2 plays / 2 players

LIKE: Fast-playing engine builder. I really enjoy the map portion as that adds the interaction by racing and maneuvering around. Not much attacking going on.

DISLIKE: Cards are a random, slightly swingy part, but I don't find it disappointing. I enjoy making best of whatever hand I'm dealt, but I can see other players's complaints on it. Explaining the text on the cards can be slow when teaching newer players.

OVERALL: A lighter game, but the powerful engine building is what keeps it interesting. In the same realm as Trains Rising Sun.

I like creating combos of cards and how the turns go quite fast. The best part is trying to figure out, how to play your hand to make the most out of it.

However, in the end I am not too fond of this one, no. It just feels a bit cheap when you can discard your whole hand of cards to get the resources you need and even some extra. The game allows you to build an engine but why bother. Just discard a bunch of cards, get resources, replenish your hand and play the best scoring cards you got. 

I also have a feeling that the game was play tested with a group of players thinking too similarly. To be more precise, I honestly do not see why anyone would bother building more than a maximum of 2 or in extreme cases 3 buildings onto one spot, since essentially you are still racing to raid the barbarian villages and finish the game while trying to grab as many odd points as possible along the way. But still there are cards in the deck that require you to have up to 5 buildings in one single space. The only case I can envisage such a thing happening would require a player to be cornered without any possibilities of expanding. This is due to the fact, that building onto the same spot where you already are, does not usually help your progress. 

Maybe I just do not understand the game well enough. I can play but would not suggest DEUS myself.

I'd heard some mixed reviews going into my first play of Deus, so I was on the lookout for a few aspects of it that had received criticism.

The first criticism is well-deserved.  Some of the color choices in the game are questionable.  The most obvious one is that the resource tokens for wood are brown, but the resource icons for wood on cards are green.  This was something that could be overcome, but it was annoying.  The other color issue is that the colors of the different categories of cards are quite similar, and don't match well with the words used for those colors in the rulebook.  In particular, the "green", "yellow" and "brown" colors are a bit hard to differentiate.  Again, this wasn't an insurmountable problem, but it did seem like a poor graphic design choice.

Color issues aside, the other complaint I had heard about the game was the imbalance in power level between different cards, and how that imbalance made the game seem random in that if you drew the best cards, you would win.  While one play is not enough to form an opinion on balance, I did not experience anything I felt was a power imbalance.  We had a winner by a sizable margin, but I felt that was due to the player simply building a stronger combo than the rest of us.  My impression is that the strength of a particular card will depend on what other cards a player has in play, which is as it should be in a card game of combo building.  Yes, there is randomness in what cards a player draws, but that's the case with any card game, and Deus allows a player to dig into the deck for specific cards through the use of the yellow god offering, much like the explore+5 action in Race for the Galaxy.

If I had one concern about the randomness in the game, it would be that sometimes a player can have difficulties finding the color of card that he/she needs.  One player had a big problem with this in my one play, and I experienced it to a lesser extent.  However, the player who ran into this problem more did not think to use the yellow god offering to try to find the specific color he wanted, so that could have been a solution to his problem.

All in all, I find Deus to be an enjoyable game with lots of possibilities for combo-building.  It does have a degree of randomness, but not so much as to detract from the game.  I look forward to playing it more.

A pretty clever new area control/engine building game.  The mechanics are pretty simple and--apart from a couple of weird "color things"--well-produced.  The luck of the draw played quite heavily in our strategies, which made it a little hard to plan.  I had many wasted turns, as I had to plan how to cycle cards.  Still, I liked it and would play it again, but probably won't buy it.

Not sure why some people complain about the theme and coloring of the game...Seems very thematic to me and the bright coloring is really only on player boards and not too obtrusive. Solid game either way. Two players seems a little fast though, hard to build a good engine if the other player gets slightly better cards from the get-go. Great game, needs to see the table more.

This is a very elegant game, with a small set of rules, but intricate gameplay arising from the cards used.

It's a tableau-building card game with a nice spatial element. It plays quickly and with limited (but still present) take that, making a great couple's game for a weekday.

It was a fine game, but I would need to replay with the variant of playing cards face down to activate things. I had to switch tactics way too often and at the end of the game got destroyed simply because I never drew cards that I needed to activate my engine and others did. Not the type of luck I like in an engine building game.

In an age of overwrought mechanics, Deus is pleasingly streamlined, elegant and easy to explain.  It is a tableau builder with a modular board on which players build, grab territory and extract resources.  Despite the territory grabbing, interaction in this game is limited to denying opponents land and thieving a few coins or vps.  

So far as the tableau building is concerned, I didn't get the feel, as I do with Race for the Galaxy, of multiple viable strategies.  Too often, across two games, my decision space has felt limited to playing the one or two cards that I could afford and which worked with my other cards and board position, or cycling through the deck. The ease of refreshing your hand at least mitigates the luck of the draw.

Production quality, at least of the first printing, is mixed.  The components are serviceable, but the brown disks to represent green resources and the miscoloured money bear the hallmarks of a rushed production process.  Similarly, while the card artwork is pleasant enough, the modular board is pug ugly.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Nice engine-building game (kind of) where your actions get more powerful as you play more cards.  The only problem is that the random card draw can stop you getting what you need, although there may be ways to mitigate that with experience.

Smart hand management mechanics in this game where timing between discarding and building is really important ! Placement and moves of the military units are something to take care too if you don't want your opponents to gain too much victory points by taking down barbarian villages... Not quite a "civilization" game, but still a great game !!!

RATING: 7
Nice eurogame with a smart use of cards. Rules are simple and easy to teach. The board is modular but the area control element is kinda minor. The whole point of the game is to make great combos with chains of cards. 

Gameplay is fast and smooth. There seems to be enough different strategies to explore. There is a bit of luck in the game but I found it acceptable.

Components are of good quality but there is a minor color problem. Wood is shown as green on the cards but the game comes with brown disks.

There is enough interaction for a eurogame.

Nice game.  More of a learning curve in terms of strategy... but still fun to play even if you have no idea what you're doing.

ETA June 2015 - not fun to play if you have an idea of what you're trying to do and you just get crappy cards.  It takes a long time for the other players to really make sure you are totally embarrassed about how you did.  So basically, I spent an evening sliding slowly under the table.  Not alcohol related, unfortunately.

This is a well designed "card effects" and "card engines" game that is simply not that interesting to me.  For better or worse, I am not particularly interested in building card to card to card to card engines, while barely noticing as the other players do the same.  

One hour later, or two hours later...have we all finished building our card engines in isolation, and the game is now over?  Your engine, whatever you did, was slightly better than my engine.  You beat me by 4 points. Okay. 

Next time, shall we play a game with more...interaction, player prediction, thematic connection, laughter, emotion, dynamic-ever changing strategy based upon other player's play, and innovative interactive puzzles for us to scrum within? Okay.

I have no desire to play this game again, so have to give it a 6 at best.

Schöne kurze Regeln, aber der Kartenmechanismus macht die ganze Sache schon sehr glücksabhängig. Man kann zwar nette Combos bauen, aber jeder spielt quasi für sich und am Ende dauert es etwas, bis man die ganze Spalte durchgearbeitet hat. Die Grafik der Landschaften fand ich auch nicht gerade passend und die Verwirrung mit den Holzscheiben trübt den Eindruck ebenfalls.

Interesting card play and discard/redraw mechanic but the rest of the game just feels flat and dull. I want to like this game more than I do but nothing about it really grabs me. The cards have too much emphasis on having multiple buildings in a single space but nothing in the game gives incentive to do it; you get more points from doing anything else and not enough for fulfilling those cards. There's nothing interesting about placing on the map tiles. Traded away as I had no desire to play it any more.

Several ways to score victory points.
The rules are not too complex.
Every turn someting can be done even if the hand cards are not very could (then they can be sacrified to get better cards or resources).
The player interaction is not too strong. Even the military cards are not too bad to make the other players angry.

Enjoyable tableau builder where you construct plots of like-colored cards and take cumulative actions, placing structures and soldiers out on a colorful hex map which will represent your area control, a chunk of your scoring potential, and the player interaction. Spend and accrue resources and use Temple cards for special scoring conditions. From the designer of Troyes, which I love quite a bit more than this, but it's a good game nonetheless and I've enjoyed playing it.

4/7/17: I don't particularly care for light civ games, particularly card based light civ games.  Given the choice I would much rather play 7 wonders, and I don't really care for that game.  Or better yet play Terraforming Mars.  I'm sure that with time you can learn how to deal with a poor hand of cards, I'm just not sure that I want to spend the time learning how to do it.  With four players taking 90 minutes it seems a little long for what it offers.

It's a good game, just nothing spectacular for me.  This just gets lost in the vast swath of mid-weight euros.

An interesting card engine building with a few twists. You are competing on a board for spaces, allowing for some player interaction often missing in these games, although the map feels very sparse and abstract. Discarding is a bit more interesting than typical, allow player to get some bonuses, like extra cards, money or buildings.

However, I found the four player game moves a bit too slowly for my tastes.

Birodalmi telepesek szint (nehézségre, játékélményre), de annál rövidebb, ami előny. A törzsek körülkerítése kicsit Samurai-os feelinget ad, a térkép meg Attika utánérzés, de egyébként nem hasonlít az említett játékokra.
Szerintem nagyon jó az, hogy jó és jobb közül lehet mindig választani, szinte minden kártya jó valamire (vagy ha nem maga a kártya, akkor az eldobása), bár a társaságban volt olyan vélemény, hogy a katonai vonal túl erős. A lényeg a templom, jól ki van találva, hogy 1-et építhetünk alanyi jogon, a többihez viszont egyenletes fejlődés szükséges. A játék olyan sok körös (~25-30), hogy szerintem nagyjából egyenletesen fogunk kapni összességében a különböző színekből. Ha valaki beszorul a térképen, az is tud érvényesülni, mert sok lap azt díjazza, ha 1 tartományban vagyunk jelen sok épülettel. Jól lehet kombózni, de nem lehet túlzásba vinni, mert minden színből max 5 lap játszható ki, tehát nagy általánosságban minden lap max 5-ször aktiválódik. Nagyon változatos, sokutas játéknak érzem, építhetünk stratégiát a legkorábban lerakott lapokra, de jócskán taktikai is a játék, nagyon lapjárás-függőek a lehetőségeink. A fa ábrázolása rendkívül amatőr hiba szerintem (zöld ikon, barna fa jelölő), de meg lehet szokni végül is.
Összességében egy jópofa kombózós, térképes játék, aminek a kiegyensúlyozottságán, leteszteltségén lehet vitatkozni, de szerintem sok parti van benne.

I really like this card combo based game with added board for greater interaction. Works really well. People I have played with complain about bad draws, but often it just comes down to what you make of your hand. 
The only aspect I'm not so sure of is the fact it can go on a little long if everyone is pursuing a longer VP strategy.
Edit: downgraded a little after a few more plays as the military actions seem more powerful, particularly if you can get the 4 coins per village card out early!
Edit 2: Also played one game where someone tried an endless discard for 10 cards, discard for 10 resources cycle which was not much fun!

Deus is an engine-building eurogame, with a hefty dose of hand management and quite a bit of confrontation.

It has a concise and elegant rule set (just three pages long), and each turn gives the player a choice between just two types of actions: build a building (and trigger its power, along with those of each and every building of the same type previously built) or appease the gods (discarding cards to replenish the hand and get some sort of bonus from the deity the player invoked).

The possibilities are vast, the tableaus will grow with possible combos and chained actions, and some players will probably fall in analysis paralysis... this is probably the only con of the game (other than that less than stellar graphic design...).

It seems to scale well with two, and it will probably see most of its plays with that number of players...

This is a fun and under-rated game. It is easy to explain and people pick it up in the first turn or two. Each turn you are either building or drawing cards and getting resources. If you don't have "good cards" then you just discard them and get new ones, along with resources. After 5 plays of this I have found interesting decisions and strategies that aren't always dependent on the cards you have. It is enjoyable building the little card engines while watching your civilization grow on the board. More addictive and deep than you might think.

Initial thoughts after 1 2p game: I really appreciate the ratio of enjoyment to time invested.

I really look forward to playing more of this one to see if it holds up.

First Play: Immediate impression was that it had a very similar feel to 7 Wonders. Not a good start as I really dislike that game. As ever with a game with a heavy card engine, the luck of the draw is significant. There are just so many times you can purge a bad hand to get resources. A helpful initial set up will allow rapid progression and useful combos. A spread and full point temple selection does not seem to be an adequate catch up mechanism.

I grew aware of the isolation of the game. I had no idea what card opponents had built and apart from encroachments on the board, player interaction was minimal unless someones troops stole points or money.

Another game that will appeal to those who like randomness and chance. Not a game that will want to play again and I dearly regret buying this on impulse and the buzz of Essen 2014.

Sold one day later.

3 player game. I was pleasantly surprised with this one. The mechanic of activating all of your cards of a color once you add another card of the same color is really intriguing. The "offerings to the gods" abilities seemed to be somewhat overpowered, though. Brian was able to offer to get about 25 goods which he turned into multiple buildings in the midgame. However, Brett pulled off the win with 2 high scoring temples. I was a distant third. Still looking to play again soon. Another game that I really feel will shine with 2.

I love the interplay between the cards and the board. Lots of interesting decisions to be made when looking ahead at future cards that you can chain together.

Deus is a very fun game, but it is quite ugly.  The brown wood tokens do not match the green wood symbols on the cards, which my wife feels is a near unforgivable offense. 
 That said, Deus is approachable, yet has deep game play. 
 For that reason, I love the Deus, and I do not see myself every getting rid of it.  I own many games, but games that are approachable, yet deep, are quite hard to find (in my opinion).  If you can get past the aesthetics, this is a wonderful game.

Its a very solid game and one that you can call in some content a civ game.

i like the boards.where one is your inner kingdom and the other is some kind of an area influence in the country.

yeah i can imagine to play it again.

The game is a little too self-absorbed, multi-player solitaire and too linear when you find your card combos. The luck of the draw can also be a factor.

 Nonetheless, I enjoyed finding the combos with the cards, the timing of your actions and the different way to use the cards... It's a "middle of the pack" game for me and I don't see it being played too often.

Why the brown discs???

Deus is a fairly quick, tableau building game with a map where players construct their buildings. I enjoyed my play. It seems there are a number of ways to make a run for the win even if I didn't find one of them. There were a few small issues with component usability that didn't really work for me... such as the green forests generating brown wood. That one caused confusion during my first play.

It's not a bad game. It's well designed. For myself it's to random and there is not enough evolution (just 6 rounds). So there is no real engine building happening. All in all is neither bad, nor good. An average game.

Civ game that somehow feels light yet has so much going on that I can't properly decide how to rate it after only one play.

Really an interesting and innovative game. Recently I buy games only if it adds something really new to my collection or has a special atmosphere. This game does both - while it offers a new, unique gameplay, it also has a very appealing and great looking design. This game is simply beautiful and makes every play enjoyable.
Only one con - the colors printed on the cards are not matching for all of the resources and money.

This one has a really neat mix of tableu building, with a middle board to interact on.  The choices you make with the different cards you get are very interesting, and the game definitely does not overstay its welcome.  Really interesting game that I am interested in playing more of for sure.  Could see this one raising with more plays.

I'm torn with this one, half of me likes it, half doesn't.

I like the tech building aspect and the hand management (which cards do you hold, throw etc), and the fact there is a bit of board play.

Don't like the variable turn length, some turns are super quick and some are AP hell. Don't like the arbitrary way each tree is capped at the limit of bits you hold for that type ... seems very gamey and artificial - they could have not put that limit on and just scaled the cost, so you could build more but at higher and higher cost. Cards also don't seem that even, some are just better - but not sure that's a problem, as long as you can get some sort of card draw.

Theme sort of feels a bit pasted on - why particular resources for particular cards? And it is a weird mix of interaction (the board) and multiplayer solo (your tableau).

Can't see why they didn't use hexes for the map, the gaps annoy me (but that's my OCD), feels like they went for this blobby look just to say "hey we don't have hexes" even though they are ...

I wonder if this fills the same niche as Race for the Galaxy - shared deck, build a tableau, and all the other stuff is just chrome, so you end up with a short game being padded out to a longer one.

Overall, not at all sure - I need to play it more to see if the downsides overwhelm the ups, or the other way round, but for now I'm not desperate to play again.

10x10 2015. Deus is a game of balance.  Balance between the board and cards.  Cards pulling you between spreading out and putting buildings in the same space.  Balance between discarding and using the cards you have.  But you don't have to be balanced to win.  There are multiple paths to victory and I've seen several very different strategies work very well.  You have to adapt to the cards that you get and build your short and mid term strategies around them.  Flexibility is key.  The game has a bit of a Settlers vibe, which, although it's dated, is a game I love.  This is a game I could see as a Settlers killer.  It has elegant and simple rules but also has some different concepts that can be a little tricky to teach- so it probably won't take Settlers' place as a gateway.  I don't really like the look of the game, but the game itself is so good that the art is growing on me.

Haven't read the rules, but saw Eric Martin's and Dale Yu's comments -- looks like an engine building, place buildings on the map area-enclosure, special-power card game.  

Simple rules is a plus but 96 cards all with potentially different effects?  My guess is it'll be ok to play, but not one I have any interest in owning.

Juego de construcción de civilizaciones con un motor de cartas muy interesante. En cada acción el jugador solo puede hacer dos cosas: Jugar una carta, o descartarla para hacer una ofrenda a los dioses. Cuando se juega una carta se activan todas las cartas de esa categoría (eso da lugar a combos interesantes) y se construye un edificio. Cuando se descarta una carta (ofrenda), cada dios te da unos beneficios que son proporcionales a la cantidad de cartas descartadas. 
Juego rapido, sencillo, interesante y con enjundia. 
De momento, solo lo he probado online y es altamente recomendable (a mí me lo recomendo Moriarty).

Juego de cartas que me recomendó Moriarty y que está realmente entretenido. En tu turno puedes jugar una carta y ejecutar todas las acciones de cartas de esa misma categoría que hubieras jugado previamente, o sacrificar cartas para obtener beneficios de los dioses. 
Escala muy bien y da muchas posibilidades de combos.
Recomendable.

Deus combines hand management, tableau-building and area control, some of my favorite mechanisms. What makes it stand out, however, is the fact that discarding your hand is sometimes more beneficial than playing it. 

The game has some interesting decisions, as you race your opponents to certain spots on the map and to find your combos faster than them. 

On the down side, the civ building theme feels like an afterthought, and 4-player games can feel a bit long. That is not a problem when playing online, which is the reason why I ultimately sold my copy. However, I would always play a game if suggested.

This one took me by surprise. Oh, you have a little tableau? Oh, you can activate the cards in your tableau to generate resources and build buildings? Hooray, another multiplayer-solitaire Euro!

Not at all. This light, family-style game quickly becomes nasty, as players cut each other off, steal points from villages, and pull off some devastating, unstoppable combos that fill the other players with dread. This is light little Euro with teeth. There are tons of painful choices to make, and the skill ceiling is pretty high so there's plenty of room for improvement. I like it!

RATING: 8
A good engine building card game, and I really like me a good engine building game.

Deus basically revolves around playing cards into your display, and activating their powers.  There are 5 types of cards, and every time you play a card, you activate ALL cards of that type previously played.

Alternatively, you may discard your cards to acquire various resources, so you must decide when you can discard cards, or when you'll want to keep them to add to your display later, which can often be a difficult decision.

There's also some board play that will affect how effective a lot of the cards in the deck are for you (every time you add a card to your display, you place a building on the board). The board and you available buildings to place on the board will effect what you are able to play, or what cards you may want to put into play based on your board positioning.

Overall, a solid game that I look forward to playing more of!

If you want themeless, multi-player solitaire, then this is the game for you.  And ugly? Yeah, it's not easy on the eyes, that's for sure.

A little too random for my tastes. You can get the best resource/money/VP engine in the world going, but if you can't get the right temples at the right time, you're screwed.

Only 2 plays of this, so I'm not prepared to slap a poor rating on this --- but at this point, this is one of those games that I would be willing to play, perhaps not enthusiastically, if someone else suggested it. I wouldn't be the one suggesting it, nor will I be the one buying it.

A game about making combos with your cards, which is never my favorite game mechanism.

This game started as a solid 6.5 and rose from game to game that we played (exclusively 2 player)! Very awesome game that can be played in ~45 minutes and always feels really satisfying. We continuously discover new strategies to create vp-generators, which always have to be balanced according to the state of the board! However, the game really needs a few rounds before it completely unfolds all its magic :)! We have quite a few games in our collection, but when we select a game to play we usually - at least briefly - consider pulling out Deus. Great game! And it still gets better from play to play :)!

Good civ building game that plays nice and snappy for what it's trying to accomplish.  The decisions are pretty good as you are trying to determine if you want to play a card for a fun power or discard it to get requirements for other cards.  The board adds a small race to not get penned in and to get the spots that best give you victory points, but there really isn't a full on attack with your military, and I'm OK with that in this game, which is more heavily based in the cards than on the map.

RATING: 5
Rated after playing the game online, so consider that caveat.

Deus is a combination of card play and effects, with building placement on a map. It's somewhat reminiscent of London and Kingdom Builder, with cards that add effects if you can find the right combination.

I dunno... for some reason I found this game frustrating and not terribly enjoyable. I know the random card draw is probably designed to generate a "make the most of what you've got" tension, but I felt that certain hands were far too limiting. It's pretty bland stuff. I'd play the game face to face just to see if that really changes things, but this is not a game I'm seeking out.

Update: two more plays online. My opinion has improved... slightly. I get it. It's not bad, but it's not something I need to own. If someone wants to play, I'll shrug my shoulders and say, "sure."

RATING: 9
I was really excited to play this game and I was definitely pleased with it. The combo building and decisions about what to play, what to discard, and the interaction on the map are all fantastic. Yes it is not direct interaction, but there is definitely interaction as you can block paths of your opponents and many of the military cards do lead to interaction. All of the different cards make for some unique plays and combined with the modular board I can already see different strategies being needed and working successfully.

I've heard most say the games are fast, but our first game took about 2 hours. I think that may have been to some odd card plays and placements at the beginning that probably were not the best choices to make.

I hope future plays are a little faster, but I'm excited to play again either way.

Update 2: Upgraded to 7, but hesitant.  After several plays, the board configuration can have a substantial effect on the impact of Ballista (and related military cards).  Other strategies can outperform Ballista so long as the game goes sufficiently long.  Game therefore not broken per se, but under certain circumstances will disproportionately favor one player if configuration and early draw coincide.

Update: First player movement plus Ballista in opening draw dominated again, with the first player getting optimal placement, branching out quickly, and raking in much cash.  He almost doubled the victory points of the second place player.  I personally was in a position to block if I could have moved my armies, but did not draw a red move card for over half the game (by which time first player was unreachable).  Conclusion: game has at least one overpowered card that, in conjunction with even a decent draw and first move advantage, causes an unbalanced game.  Downgraded to 6.

After four-player first play.  Potential to increase in value, but like all games with highly asymmetrical cards (like Agricola), a good initial hand of reinforcing cards coupled with the startspieler advantage gave one player an insurmountable lead within the first few turns; the rest of the game was spent deciding who would come in second.  Rated at 7.

The expansion definitely helps to fix the issue with science wherein I managed to completely run away with the game because the right science cards came up for my combination of played cards allowing for what might be considered OP access to end-game points.

An interesting engine building game with fairly unique cascading card combo effects. There is a fair amount of luck involved with card drawing, which although mitigate-able, can result in at least loss of tempo. Between equally skilled players, the one with the better hand will win, and this is not a characteristic I cherish in games. 

I find the board art awful, and the cards could have been much much cleverer in their interaction. A missed opportunity.

A little flat. It looks busier than it is. This is one of those tableau building games with multiple columns, like ZhanGuo. But it's easier to see when card effects fire. When adding a new card to a column, everything in that column fires, in order they were placed in that column. It works well enough. I'm just not quite as enamored as other folks seem to be on games where it's actually hard to know what other players can do without carefully examining what's in front of them. I prefer games where most game state is shared on the center board, with maybe the only other player state being stuff like their holdings in general terms (money, meeples, etc), rather than special cards that do all kinds of exceptions.

RATING: 5
A friendly card engine builder reminiscent of Bruges and La Isla, but with the added benefit that cards stay with you, and build up to sizable numbers, thus giving you a decent amount of wriggle room over the course of the game. The card management is wedded to very mild area control without serious interaction.

As such the game is, as I stated, friendly. The idea is that you try to make the most of your cards, over time selecting a proper amount of them which help you play the game in the way you want it. That said, really different ways of playing the game do not really exist because all cards tend to do similar things. So it's more an idea of [i]colours[/i] determining your strategy rather than the cards; and since those colours are very tightly fixed, there is not much room for creative play here, especially not since interaction between players is as fleeting as it is. As such I found the quick beginning of the game fun; but the final 1/3rds were really a drag. This was 60 minutes of funtime stretched thin to fit in 90+ minutes. Players are consolidating their positions and hoping that the cards are sufficiently attractive that the game can be ended at some point; apart from the larger card engines there really isn't much difference in how the game is played in the end compared to how it is played in the beginning.

While I initially enjoyed the pleasing and quick rythm of Deus, this mild happiness subsided as the game wore on. This costs the game at least one point: had there been more to do at that stage I might have been more lenient. But Deus is just too quiet. Polished, but quiet. Too bad, I would have liked to like it better than I currently do, especially because I consider Pearl Games' Sébastien Dujardin to be a better designer than Xavier Georges; and would rather see Sébastien design the games than Xavier. Alas, this is not the case: c'est la vie.

Nicely paced engine builder.  There's some luck in the cards, but you can always discard and draw a new hand.   With experienced players it should play quickly.  I would have preferred hexes to the teardrop shaped regions.

The language on some cards is regrettable.  For example - Earn 6 VP per region with 5 building of your color.  How am I going to get all those buildings on a boat?  The secret is that the designer wants you to count the temple.  Except that the temple is white, not "of your color".  We had to stop the game while someone looked up errata on their phone.

Tiens, ça faisait longtemps qu'on n'avait pas eu un jeu casse-neurones à la triche.Le thème est RE-VO-LU-TIO-NNAIRE : Vous prenez la tête d'une civilisation antique et vous devez coloniser les territoires avec vos marchands, vos armées et en appelant les divinités. Non, en fait, le thème, on s'en fout un peu. C'est la mécanique qui est intéressante avec un système de gestion de carte qui se renouvellent en permanence. Les règles sont simples mais les possibilités multiples. Et puis, bon, c'est LE PearlGame de l'année, alors on ne pouvait pas passer à coté.

Goed strategisch denkspel, waarbij je je eigen rijk ontwikkelt aan de hand van kaarten die je trekt. Welke kaarten je trekt, bepaalt in welke richting je rijk zich ontwikkelt (productie, handel, militair). Doordat je kaarten kan offeren aan de goden om geld, grondstoffen, gebouwen of gewoon andere kaarten te krijgen, wordt die afhankelijkheid van de getrokken kaarten binnen redelijke perken gehouden.

Deus is a game I thoroughly enjoy and I've played quite a few games of it after Spiel 2014. Nearly all of them have been online and so I have been disposed to a lot of different opponents and playstyles. The thing that has surprised me the most is how different the game can feel depending on the strategy avenues you and your opponents are on. Some games are very friendly, combo heavy and last for quite some time while others are a mad dash for the victory points on the map. A fair word of warning: I've also had some games where no player could find a way to do something great with the cards they got dealt and therefore that particular game didn't feel that exciting. But the more I've played Deus, the less did this happen.

Somewhere I read that someone described Deus as Race for the Galaxy - The Boardgame. I think this description is quite fitting. Like RftG, Deus is more tactical than strategic and you might get screwed by a card draw, but with some practise you'll find ways to mitgate a bad card draw. I do especially like that Deus is a very streamlined games with easy to teach rules. Five to ten minutes of explanation and you're ready to go. Great game!

I liked it. Somewhat solitaire and a bit AP prone but still some awesome stuff here. I like how you have to balance the cards with offering to the gods. Wouldn't play it with more than three players though due to downtime. Playing time would go down by a lot if the green resources were actually green instead of brown.

Will gladly play again and think the rating is likely to go up.

Game which reminds me very much of Kingdom builder in connection with some hand management and area control. Cards draw is very random and can destroy the game. Need more games to evaluate. For the moment it is an OK game. Need to think if randomness on the card draw can be eliminated with strategy or it requires some other rules/expansion.

In excellent game. Resource management. Variable powers. And a sense of growth and engine building. This is my kind of game. It is shorter then most engine building games like nations which means that it can be played for for the same feel but when you only have an hour. Great addition

an update to this game. l am continuing to enjoy it. I have found that the card draw can be random which means that you could have a bad game if you're unlucky. As long as the game doesn't go on too long this is not a problem. Also there is a suggested variant at the end of the rulebook that fixes this issue
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Solid card management game, where you either build a building by paying resources, then activating each building in the just built group, or offer cards up to the gods for new cards and some special abilities.  Nice decisions abound - what to build, what to toss, neat Settlers-esque spatial board play - blocking, and taking territory.  Simple to teach and play, not too thinky, and not too long.  Nice to play a solid Euro that doesn't feel like an over the top points salad worker placement game.  Good stuff.

After having played 20+ games of 2 and 3 player, I was then *amazed* at how tense and different the two player was. Really changes up the dynamic and increases the tension. 

After thinking it over, I've upped my rating to a 10. The game plays quick - requires little setup time - every game is different, and requires making the agonizing choices of keeping cards for the long term or tossing them for a *chance* at a short term gain. The randomization of the cards is offset by the quick play time and the player's ability to 'dig' through the deck if need be. Great game, that doesn't punish the players.

A very solid and straight forward engine builder.   Cards are played into columns, and each new card re-triggers the older ones in the same column.   There is incentive to diversify also, as this allows the construction of temples which can earn many VP.   I badly wanted to smash my opponents armies, but that type of direct conflict isn't present here.   There are some production issues with the disc colors (brown discs are green on the cards).   The map tiles are neat and offer enough variety in the setup.   Luck of the draw might be an issue as the typical hand size will be around 5 and there are 6 types of buildings.   This went onto my wishlist after just one play.

This is one of the 10 games of my "top 5"! We play it very often, with any player count. It sounds complex, but rules are quite simple: you use cards in your hands either to build them or to discard them and get a "discard effect". So despite the randomness of the draw, you can always make a useful move to develop your game.

This game is great but desperately needs a 2nd edition to fix a few things. 1) The artwork is horrible, 2) component quality is awful and 3) I felt it finished too quickly and I couldn't run my engine as I wished, so a bit frustrating. But it is a really good game, I almost felt like an lighter version of Terraforming Mars. Hence I believe a 2nd improved edition is a must!

My fave game of Essen 2014.   It is part deck builder, part area control, part confrontation, and completely brilliant.  

There are some wonderfully tough decisions to make as you have to discard cards to gain benefits.  So you not only have to decide what to play and what you may want to play in the future, you also have to work out what to get rid of.  And often the card which will gain you the most from playing it will also get you the most from discarding it.  Terrific stuff.

And it plays in 90 minutes.

It feels like a combination of Catan, Race for the Galaxy, and Ginkgopolis.  

There's something off about Deus that keeps me from playing it as often as I'd play other games, and it's weird saying that as it's probably one of my most played games.  I'd probably play it a whole heck of a lot more though, but there's something about it that keeps me from pulling it off the shelf.  It might be the game box.  It might be that the components lack an aesthetic cohesion.  I'm uncertain.  Hence the rating of a 7.

However, after every game I play, I'm always amazed at how awesome the game is.  I might not pick it off the shelf, but I also never hesitate to play back to back games.  If I had the time, I'd play three games in a row.  There are so many different ways to approach each game with the cards your dealt, and after some-teen or twenty something plays I'm still finding new things to do, still finding that there's more to learn, and my enjoyment of the game just keeps increasing.

You can try to set up your hand to chain react, building buildings and quickly claiming territory.  You can methodically scour the draw deck, slowly building a strong combination of cards with a long game payoff.  You can play all the card columns and go for temples.  You can build a mobile military machine and race to raid all the barbarian villages.  You can hone in on a column or two and build all different sort of engines - money and point engines, resource and building engines, resource and point engines, card columns that reactivate cards in other columns.  There are so many different ways to approach this game and carving out your path of cards is oh so satisfying.

Deus is a rare game in that it's a 7 when it's on the shelf, but a 9 or 10 when I'm playing it.

The newer printings actually fixed all the aesthetic issues I have - I wish I had some of those newer components.  Oh well.  A 10 it is.

2015-09-12 : Elegance is an overused word, but there's no better one to describe this game. Simple mechanics that all beautifully work together so that the sum is greater than its parts. Very fine cards and player board layout, icons and graphics but whoever is responsible for those 
map pieces ... well, I wouldn't hire him to paint the shed. 4 games in and it seems bunching up and not spreading out is the dominant strategy, but games are always close and there's little downtime in this game.

Enjoyed this well thought out engine builder game. Has good interaction on the main board while still maintaining your own little domain. This is the kind of game I really enjoy because I can develop my strategy while being challenged by others.

This should have been completely in my wheelhouse: tableau builder, Pearl Games, spatial element, and very pretty (well, the cards are anyway). Sadly, the board was kind of ugly and the 'wood' resource discs don't really match the green symbol on the cards. You have a number of different resources you have to manage, buildings have to be in your personal supply to build them, and complete combos to get victory points. The card powers felt very dull to me. It does have a very innovative mechanism: discard cards from your hand and depending on the 'suit' of what the top card is, get a special benefit which is usually amplified by how many cards you're discarding. Another nice one is that when you play a card to your tableau, you activate all previously played cards in your tableau of the same suit. I don't know if it's that I'm just used to being restrained so much in other games, but it just felt too easy to get what you want. I should like that, but I didn't really like it in this one. I think if I were to play it more, I'd get used to it, but I have other games that I prefer now. This game also commits one of the board game cardinal sins: After getting rid of the useless insert, the rule book is too large to lie flat in the bottom of the box. Not sure if I got a dud, but it grates my nerves. I don't want to have to cut it to get it to fit, or have it on top of other components not lying flat! Argh!!

Almost passed on this one due to the silly, fantasy-esque box cover and language-neutral deity title, but glad I didn't.  This is more Civilization than Cyclades.

Not a light filler, not a deep Civ game, but a true middle-weight Euro.  Is it Goldilocks or does it fall neither, not yet sure. Zee Garcia calls this Race for the Galaxy, the boardgame, with little player interaction, but still well worth a look.  

With 4 players, there aren't enough cards at 96 (as certain cards are hoarded near the end to block others), so the rulebook variant is a must. It also has that 7 Wonders problem, where one often has no idea who is in the lead or winning as much of the scoring occurs in the final turn or at the end of the game.

A fantastic mix of civ-building and area control that is all driven by some clever tableau-building card play. Determining whether to play a building card, or offer up cards for one of the God powers is often a tough choice to make each turn. I absolutely love how the cards in your tableau get extra activations each time you add a card of the same type to it. It creates an excellent sense of progression, and it feels so rewarding each time you execute your chain of actions.

You have to be careful, though! If you spend too much time reshaping your hand, then you could end up falling behind on the cutthroat nature of the area control. Similarly, if you spread yourself out too thin, then you might not be able to take advantage of some of the more powerful card combinations. Excellent!


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Love the engine building. Love the way you have to factor that each combo has an end point. Love the finite resources, that draining a supply pool can stop or slow down other players. The interaction may not be immediately direct, but you can roadblock or capitalise on opponents with good play.
The drawbacks are that new players may not catch on to what options exist to get ahead for a little too long during play and that the game could look so much better.

[b]It looks like Catan, you expand your empire somewhat similar to Attika, and all of this is driven by a card-chain-combo building system a bit like Imperial Settlers. I own this and am on the fence about keeping it.[/b]

PROS:
- looks like Catan, so easier to persuade Catan lovers
- turn options are straight-forward, not too complex
- cards allow for several different strategic branches
CONS:
- slightly more complicated to learn than you'd expect for what plays fairly light
- a few terms are confusing (region, and structure)
- iconography makes sense once you get it, but a bit confusing until you do
- producing resources can be a bit tricky for casual gamers

1st play. I bought this game because my partner loves Catan, and I don't, and I thought Deus might be a Catan-killer. We struggled to get our empires off the ground, but then really enjoyed the build-up and sudden payoff at the end. This might end up being a solid light-middleweight in my collection (like Suburbia).

2nd play. Kevin wanted to give it a go. I focused on large cities, in part to see if it was a good strategy. I won, so it worked this game.

[b]4th play[/b]. I feel like this game is starting to burn a bit brighter. The card-combos that I initially thought of as not "crazy" enough actually do provide the structure needed for the game to be tight and offer a variety of resource- and point-generators. This is a euro game, and a fairly snappy one at that. The comparison to Attika seems best to be, with a sleek resource-building engine well integrated.

Az idén először megrendezésre kerülő magyar Titkos Télapónak köszönhetően kaptam meg a játékot. Elég gyorsan sikerült is kipróbálni, igaz egyelőre, csak két kétfős party formájában.

Történet
Egy ősi civilizáció vezetői vagyunk. Megpróbáljuk felfedezni a környező világot, városokat építeni, kereskedni, nomeg leigázni és uralmunk alá vonni a barbár törzseket. Sok gonosztettünk közben nem feledkezhetünk meg az istenekről sem: áldozatok bemutatásával valamint templomépítéssel kell a kedvükben járnunk.

Külsőségek
Szép, moduláris tábla, ami furcsán lekerekített hexákból áll. A fa alkatrészekkel se spóroltak: épületek, nyersanyagok szép számban, átlagos alkatrészekből. Ezen kívül jó sok kártya, nagyon jól átlátható elrendezéssel, közepes grafikákkal. Itt kell megemlíteni, hogy valami furcsa okból kifolyólag a fa barna korong, de közben minden rá hivatkozó kártyán zöld. Ez kicsit zavaró eleinte. Összefoglalva: szép, jó minőségű, de nem kiemelkedő.

Játékmenet
Senkit ne tévesszen meg a nagy moduláris tábla és a sok figura: mert ez tulajdonképpen egy tablóépítős kártyajáték, némi táblás körítéssel. Jó hír, hogy a szabályok pofon egyszerűek: 3 oldal az érdemi rész, az amúgy is mindössze 8 oldalas szabályból. A körödben két dolgot tehetsz:

1. Kijátszol egy kártyát, azaz építesz egy épületet. A tablódba teszed a kártyát és a színéhez tartozó "épületet" felteszed a táblára. Ez 5+1 féle lehet: hajó, katona, termelő, tudományos, civil + templom. A tábla gyakorlatilag csak korlátozza a kártyakijátszási (építési) lehetőségeidet, mivel megfelelő hely kell az épületnek, illetve magával az épület figurával is rendelkezned kell, ugyanis alapból csak korlátos készlettel indulunk. Miután feltetted a figurát, jön a legérdekesebb rész: végrehajtod a kártyán lévő képességet. Ez elsőre nem annyira érdekes, de később, ha újabb épületet építesz ugyanabból a típusból, akkor mindig, minden ilyen épületednek újra végrehajtod a képességet. Ez adja központi mechanikáját a játéknak. Emiatt ugyebár megéri specializálódni valamire. De aztán kiderül, hogy mégse annyira, mivel a legtöbb pontot adó templomokat csak akkor építhetsz, amikor már készen van minden épületből legalább egyed, ráadásul nem olyan egyszerű egyféle épületből sokat megszerezni készletbe. Szóval itt folyamatosan egyensúlyozni kell.
Az épületek képessége szinte minden esetben összefügg a táblán lévő állással: x nyersanyagot kapsz minden második épületed után, y pontot kapsz, ha ez meg az teljesül a táblán stb. Emiatt figyelned kell arra, hogy mik a jelenlegi és jövőbeli lehetőségeid a térképen.

2. Áldozat bemutatása. Ilyenkor nem építesz, hanem megpróbálsz megszabadulni a nem szimpi kártyáktól, és ezzel nyersanyaghoz, épületekhez, illetve újabb kártyákhoz jutni. Érdekes mechanizmus itt, hogy a legfelső eldobott lapod adja meg, hogy pontosan miket kapsz, de hogy mennyit, az az eldobott lapok számától függ, de független azok típusától. Ez valamennyire egy passz akciónak tudható be, de olyan nagy a hozománya, hogy folyamatosan mindenki rá lesz kényszerítve ennek a végrehajtására is.

Kb. ennyi a játék, tényleg nem bonyolult

Vélemény
Elég nagyok voltak az elvárások, tekintve, hogy a szerző jegyzi a kimondhatatlan nevű sorozat darabjait, amik elég jól sikerültek: Troyes, Tourney.
Szeretem a kártyás dolgokat, a tablóépítést, az egyszerű, de nagyszerű, aránylag gyors játékokat. Na ez erre mind igaz. A szabálymagyarázat max. 10 perc, a játékidő személyenként kb. 15 perc. Mi kettesben fél óra alatt lenyomtuk a második játékot (ketten (is) nagyon jól működik). A kártyák speciális aktiválása miatt nagyon nagy a kombózási faktor. Nyelvfüggő ugyan, de ennek nem kell elriasztania senkit, mert minden kártyán ikonnal is rajta vannak a képességek, amik eléggé egyértelműek. Kifejezetten taktikai játék, mindig a kezedben lévő kártyákból kell kihozni a maximumot. Mivel vannak egyértelműen a játék elején/végén hasznos kártyák, ezért van szerepe a szerencsének, de eléggé pörögnek a lapok, ami jelentősen csökkenti ezt. Szokás szerint nem mernék két játék után nyilatkozni a szerencsefaktor pontos mértékéről.

Nekünk nagyon bejött, ajánlom minden tablóépítés-kedvelőnek. Még egyszer köszönöm kedves TT.

8 pont, de ezek még változhat a többjátékosos élmény függvényében.

Fúú négyesben is nagyon jól működik. Csak azért nem adok 10-est, mert szerintem kéne hozzá hamar egy kieg, hogy több és többféle kártya legyen. Amíg nincs addig is: 9.5

RATING: 9
Fantastic game, lots of interesting choices and combinations, even more so for it's simplicity.

The only reason why this is not a 10: everything in the game feels under player control except getting a building that you really really need. Can be frustrating wasting turns fishing for the right card.

RATING: 6
Despite its thematic trappings and the dudes-on-a-map look Deus isn't one of those civilization games. It is much closer to 7 Wonders than it is to Civilization, for example.

Deus is, first and foremost, a tableau- and combo-building game where some of the card functions also refer to the map. The card play itself is pretty clever, with discards being a veritable action by themselves and ensuring that there is a steady flow of cards. With the map only being an afterthought interaction is unsurprisingly low but turns are typically quick enough so that downtimes stay thankfully short regardless.

RATING: 6
Civ/tableau builder with a little area control, hurt a little bit by initial randomness.  
 The randomness is mitigated a large degree by the clever sacrificing system. The game has a sort of cute/quaint feeling to it, with the straightforward yet painterly quality to the art, and this sort of color-coordinated way of organizing buildings.  Best elements mechanically are creating combos and having some sort of tactical map to intersect with card-play.  It is nice to have a civ builder that has a simpler decision tree, but this means greater potential for thematic oddities, for example... that building effects are only enacted when another building of the same type is built.  Sometimes, it also feels too restrictive in what you can do, based on your card draw, to the extent where it feels more like a tactical puzzle than an open-ended civ builder (there are positive and negative aspects to this feeling).  Another notable downside is that the game lacks the "wow" moments for a game called Deus; in other words, the presence of "Gods" feels underwhelming.  Overall, you'll be proud of the civilization you make at the end (even if it doesn't tell as strong as a story as other civ games) and there are a lot of mechanics to enjoy, they just aren't blended together to create the most dramatic or compelling of products.

Komprimiertes, smartes Karten-Kombo-Spiel im Civ-Themenmantel, indem die eigene Kartenauslage elegant limitiert wird. DEUS spielt sich schnell und flüssig und besticht durch ein frisches Spielgefühl, dessen kleines Geheimnis sich nicht einfangen lässt. Ein gelungenes Beispiel wie abstrakte Spielfläche aus Landschaftsblumen und formale Enge zu einem schönen, weiten Spielerlebnis führen kann. Die runde, bunte, lebensfrohe Optik ist die äußere Entsprechung zu dieser inneren Harmonie.

Deus is a very nice card play and territory grabbing game that feels a little like several other games I've played but works uniquely with all of its sourced mechanics. It has a very Euro feel but a very crisp rulebook and it is easy to play but with lots of things to think about while playing. This is an interesting card combo sort of game that at times bogs down because of all of the text and time to consider the effects of playing certain cards, but I'm sure this will speed up with experience. I like being able to cycle through cards you don't need to get something you want, but getting specific (and planned) benefits by cycling through cards. Lots of luck with card pulls, but luck is managed in a way not too common in card games. Deus has to be played as a tactical game and not exactly a strategic game.  You really need to know when to make the best of the cards you have and when to cycle to new cards (like Scrabble tiles, ya know?)  There's some smarts in this game!  Maybe not one that will be remembered as a pinnacle of design in the years to come, but for any fan of Euros and card games, I think this one will impress.

Advanced Imperial Settlers pretty much sums this one up.  It can be a little unlucky if you start out with a bad hand of cards.  I'm not a huge fan of the premise of this game: gain a benefit when you take your action drawing cards.  Drawing cards is never a fun or rewarding in games (it always feels like a wasted turn) and adding a bonus doesn't fix the problem.  Still an interesting enough game.

The game is extremely entertaining!
Fantastic combo-maker. Tons better than Trzewik's settlers. Beginning of the game might be very random - for example you might not get any production cards at all.
Rating based on online plays.

EDIT
Might be really random - this is very similar con to Imperial Settlers where, if you don't get production buildings at the beginning of the game - you have to sacrafice at least one turn for searching for good cards. Although here it is much easier to get plethora of cards.

EDIT 2
The artwork is nice, but the setting is so-so and soooooo generic! Come on - buildings from different eras and cultures mixed together?

The big hit of Essen 2014, its a quick playing medium weight Euro style civilization lite. (Hows that for a whole bunch of adjectives!) It was an absolute blast, quite deep and even has some attacking and stealing involved which is a bit of a surprise with a Euro. Its a very tactical game with a smidgen of strategy. You really have to set up card combos to really score big and the decisions you have to make can be agonizing. Highly recommended.

Catan variant - place buildings and play cards to trigger building abilities - good resource collection/VP conversion engine building game.

BUT:
There is a sort of "can't do anything else so I will get lots of resouces" play that speeds the game but is also somewhat arbitrary and outside the normal play of the game.
High on multiplayer solitaire scale - difficult to be involved in other player's turns as you cannot really see what they are doing - other than the flow of resource cubes.
Bits are Ok - the brown wood tokens are confusing relative to the green wood areas and green coins.

Nifty game that balances well with different amount of players. In essence it's resource collecting and combo creating with a board element. The civilization theme isn't strong but it actually helps in that none of it feels forced. What do ships do? Trade. What does military do? Beat up barbarians and move around. 
It's something like an enjoyable Race for the galaxy combined with Settlers on steroids.

Almost the poster child for multiplayer solitaire, but I like this game quite a bit. It's fun to put together combos and build a functional tableau.

After ~7 games, I'm a little annoyed when the game slows down. For whatever reason, Deus is a game that doesn't induce AP in me (I usually know what my next turn will be before it happens--usually as I'm taking my current turn), so I'm less tolerant of it in others. (I feel similarly about Terraforming Mars: play it fast! There's not enough to study if there's a lot of downtime.)

Tableau building with a spacial/board element. Very light civ feel. Very big card combo feel.

The game can be underwhelming if it lasts too long. It becomes much more interesting once you discover that it is a race game. However, unlike other games that are all about racing to victory (most notably, Race for the Galaxy), game length differs considerably depending on player choices. Sometimes it can be difficult to end the game (especially if one player is behind and stops working toward the end game to try and catch up). In these situations, the game starts to drag on.

A little while ago debated whether or not to get Splendor. I decided against it, largely because the feeling was a little like smoking rock cocaine. Sort of cheap and zoomy, with diminishing returns. This is generally how I feel about the latest trend towards more streamlined, hooky gaming this past year.

Deus is like that, but features more of a red wine hobo vibe. The thrills are just as cheaply addictive, but it keeps you a little bit warmer as you curl up with it on your sewer grate.

I was a bit underwhelmed by this game considering all of the hype it got last year. It was an OK game but there were a few points in the game where I was stuck and could not draw the cards I needed. I tend to get frustrated with games where you need beneficial random card draws in order to fulfill your strategy. It was ok. I think it needs another play as well but I honestly probably won't get to that play unless somebody else asks to play it.

This is what I wanted Bruges to be. You get a hand and have to think about which cards to use for their special powers and which to trade for necessary-but-boring resources. There are some crazy combos but also some benefit to stolid economic planning. And as a bonus there's an interesting abstract sub-game of claiming spots on the board and (partially) cutting people off from the areas they need.

It shares some of Bruges' downsides too. There's some cube-pushing (four interchangeable resources in this, five interchangeable colors of worker in Bruges) and the special powers are never *quite* as odd or flavorful as you want them to be. But Deus's combo system adds a layer of interest: should you build that cheap and useless green building just to re-trigger the awesome green building you already have?

Joc de desenvolupament en un mapa que es guanya per PV. Es tracta de construir ciutats composades per diferents tipus d'edificis en zones. Aquests edificis es construeixen mitjançant una mà de 5 cartes, que et marquen el que pots construir i el que no. A més, hi ha una serie de punts al taulell que s'obtenen quan s'ha rodejat per complet una zona (al estil Samurai) i uns edificis (temples) que et donen punts en funció de uns objectius (no pots construir dos fins que no en tinguis un de cada tipus, tres fins dos de cada tipus etc...).

Molt simple (poques opcions) i limitat al que et surti a la mà. És un conjunt de mecàniques sense gaire rel·lació.

Em recorda a diferents jocs: al Romolo o Remo? (per els diferents tipus d'edificis i que a és estiguin limitats), al Terra Mystica (per el desenvolupament en el mapa, tot i que aquí es pot construir més d'un edifici per zona), al Ginkgopolis (per la construcció mitjançant cartes, tot i que aquí no es fa un draft) i al Samurai (per com s'obtenen els punts de vitoria dels poblats barbars).

Deus provides a mix of hand and resource management, tableau-building with combos, and area-connection/spreading (like with Attika) to create a game in which everything feels familiar to me. The question for me is: is the sum greater than the parts?

Here's where I waffle as some all the inclusions feel welcome across the genres (e.g., spatiality to tableau building? yes please). However, by the time things are said and done, there seems to be too much to keep track of in opponents's tableaux (if one desires to keep play light and quick as suggested by the time on the box) such that the game begins to lean towards parallel play. Partner this with the Euro tendency to keep powers in check and to provide few means of poking at opponents (above and beyond boxing them in) and suddenly, the game feels more like one in which you play the cards you have at your disposal the best you can (like Innovation) but without having to consider too strongly what your opponents are doing (unlike Innovation).

Good enough game - but I wish that the games six (or 5) coloured cards all did the same thing so you could quickly read the state of play from across the table and engage with them in a more meaningful way.

RATING: 7.25
Deus is a tableaux-building Civ-lite, with very abstract tech trees created by the cards, and a conflict-free area control created with very colorful abstract boards that piece together randomly.

So while it covers most of the basic elements, the level of abstraction is rather high, and the round play very streamlined.

On a player's turn, they either play a card, activating all the chained cards in that tree, or they discard cards as an offering to the Gods, taking a new hand refill, a building, and perhaps another resource.

Cards take money, or resources, or both to build, and then require legal placement of a building: a Tech cylinder, a Trade house, a Resource factory, Nautical building (ship/port) or a Military building (army/siege equipment).

These buildings have a limited stock of 5 per player, so each tree can be run a maximum of five times- and armies- the only mobile "building"- can be moved a maximum of 5 times, depending on card powers.

Resources and new buildings come only through discards, or other card activations- the terrain spaces on the boards only come into play after a card activates them, so that mountain miners or forest lumberjacks only mine or log when a card says so.

The terrain spaces only affect movement in so far as ships (nautical buildings) are needed to traverse them, and there are no disasters.

All this makes for a limited amount of interaction, other than racing to occupy spaces or possibly stealing money or other items from players bordering your armies. 

The game focuses on using the Civ environment to build a tableaux, and then work it for points during the game, or setup game-end points for resource majorities or through Temple-bonuses.

Game-end is triggered by exhausting the stock of Temples or by conquering all the indigenous people spaces on the board (one per tile).

This can make game-end a little difficult to drive to, as adding new Temples requires a set of other buildings as well, and the geography created (not to mention limited card activations) tends to create difficult to reach pockets, possibly in the back areas of a straggling player.

So there is a possibility that players could stone-wall, or drag-out a game they are not winning, in hopes of garnering enough points to catch up- the leaders cannot exterminate opponents (no combat) and close out a strategic victory.

Winning comes solely from the points generated by the engine, the bonuses and the resources of players.

All this Deus a good entry-level Civ-lite, with lots of interesting choices turn to turn at the start and especially the middle of the game, but which doesn't always race to the end, or allow for a dominant strategy to overwhelm the others.

It's a good game, and I'm glad to have it, but if I have the time, Clash of Cultures really scratches the Civ itch better- assuming that I don't have time or players for a short game of Civilization itself.

(03/09/2015) Comment based on 16 plays.

This is a GREAT game, combining the card drafting/management aspect of 7 Wonders, the area control, city building aspect of Terra Mystica, along with the tableau building aspect of London, to convey a satisfying civilization-lite feel that plays in 60-75 minutes.

This has been our group's latest hotness, where this has been played on all of our recent game nights. There is no hesitation in playing this game first, and then at least one more time, because it is a very satisfying design, leaving players with the thought that they could do better the next time. Even if I lose, it is still a wonderful experience watching my empire grow and flourish from humble and meager beginnings.

The game is centered around 96 cards, of six different colors, with 16 cards in each color. Each color is associated with one of the six gods in the game, and hence the name: "Deus". Blue cards are associated with Neptune and maritime buildings, and deal with converting gold into resources or vice versa, as well as converting resources into VP. Green cards are associated with Ceres and production, and deal with generating resources based on the terrain they are built upon (making area control an important aspect). Yellow cards are associated with Minerva and scientific buildings, and result in more cards or buildings, based on the building density of each region on the board, or possibly the opportunity to "activate" another building. Brown cards are associated with Vesta and civil buildings, where they generate gold or VP, based on the building density also or terrain occupied. Red cards are associated with Mars and military buildings, and some allow movement of military units, or "buildings", on the board, enable stealing of gold or VP from other players, or from the various barbarian villages that occupy the board. Purple cards are associated with Jupiter and temple buildings, where they serve only end-game scoring VP, based on building density, hoarding of specific resources, or occupying specific terrain on the board; purple cards also act as a "wild", representing any of the other five colors during an offering.

Five cards are dealt to each player at the beginning of the game, along with an assortment of building pieces, gold, VP, and resources. A card can then be placed on the player's tableau, provided they can pay for it in the printed resource costs and if the building is available on their tableau. Then, the player can place the building on the board. The player then gains the benefits of the card, and others of that type that were built previously.  The benefits can be gold, resources (wheat, stone, wood, or clay), new buildings, new cards, or VP, depending on the number of buildings on a specific space, or on the specific terrain.

A player could alternatively "sacrifice" a number of cards to one of the five gods (Jupiter serves as a "wild"), each which is connected to one of the five building types as mentioned before. If maritime, they get more gold. If production, then more resources. If scientific, more cards. If civil, then 1 or 2 VP. If military, more buildings from the general supply to place on the tableau. The number of cards determines the amount of gold/resources/cards/VP/buildings the player receives for a given offering. Also, they get one building piece from the general supply to put on their tableau, which is then available for placement on the board in a subsequent turn.

The interplay between the various gods, cards, buildings, and terrain is a thing of beauty. Cards cannot be played and buildings placed on the board without gold and/or resources. Gold cannot be generated without maritime buildings or offerings to Neptune. Resources cannot be generated without production buildings placed on specific terrain or offerings to Ceres. Cards are not refreshed, unless a player makes an offering to Minerva or the player has previously built scientific buildings. Buildings are generally not refreshed without specific scientific buildings or an offering to Mars, or to the specific god in question. 

Although the players are given a starting assortment of resources, gold, buildings, and cards, it becomes quickly apparent that they cannot make any progress without making offerings to one or more gods. Thus, players will need to make agonizing choices on which cards to discard in the sacrifice(s), so that they can then get the resources in order to continue making progress. "Fall in love" with a card or two (that you cannot build yet) early on in the game means a plugged up hand, a slow development, and eventual loss. Players must cut quickly and cleanly, without looking back at what they've thrown away--the cards may eventually recycle back into your hand, but don't count on it. Eventually, the players will have built up an engine where they no longer need to rely on sacrificing to the gods, because their tableau will provide enough gold, resources, cards and buildings to last them to the end of the game. At some point, the players will transition to the end-game, where they will build the relatively expensive temples to score end-game points, and trigger the end of the game. 

Far from just being a card drafting game, there is also an interesting spatial element in Deus, represented by a geomorphic board, which scales nicely between two to four players. The varying board results in different terrain distributions, as well as the distribution of "barbarian" villages, which can be a source of gold or VP, depending on the player. Further, the players have freedom to start building on any edge of the board and are not confined to the traditional predetermined starting positions. This makes the first few rounds of play very exciting and sometimes frustrating. Players have the choice of building "up", as in building as many varied buildings within a given space, or building "out", as in spreading as far as possible and controlling as many regions on the board. While most cards tend to reward higher density building clusters, there are others that encourage spreading out to control specific terrain.

The components are top notch, with Settlers-like wooden buildings, wooden resource discs, and high quality cardboard. The cards have excellent graphics and readable text, along with easy-to-understand "Euro" symbols. Although they have a high-quality linen finish, within ten plays or so the card back edges will start to chip, so sleeves are highly recommended. The rules are well written, although there have been a few corner cases that need clarification (most have already been cleared up on the rules forums).

The game is so good that I immediately bought a copy for myself after playing it several times, followed by several others, because they would like to introduce it to their friends. Although there were concerns about multi-player solitaire at first, with repeated plays it have become apparent that the area-control aspect on the board is intense with as much interaction as one would expect in Terra Mystica, with players racing against each to seize control of the best terrain, as well as position themselves near barbarian villages, so they can plunder both gold and VP from them. Players can suddenly be cutoff, but they can always start building from another board edge, although they would have to lose 3 VP for the privilege. However, players have recovered from such situations, either building aggressively upward, or forming colonies elsewhere. The card play can become rather intense as well, as players search through the deck for key cards, while holding onto others that other players desire. There is something satisfying about watching one's civilization grow, either upward or outward, as well as setting up and triggering a huge payoff in terms of gold, resources, cards, buildings, or VP, in the latter part of the game. The game starts out rather slow, as players struggle to get the necessary gold/resources to put out buildings, and making a number of offerings to the gods. In this manner, the card play feels on the outside like 7 Wonders, but the payoff feels more like running your city in a game of London. Deus scratches so many different itches so well, and so frequently, that it can be quite addictive, and hence why our group wants to play it again and again. No game since Nations from last year has garnered such a response. Although there is some randomness, this is a superb design that aptly balances skill versus chance. Light and accessible for most gamers, there is a lot of depth that heavier gamers will enjoy. It is a solid "9", with a strong possibility it will become a "10" very soon. It is a sheer delight to play.

(06/01/2015) After 33 plays in three months, the novelty has not worn off. Not since Dominion has a game given my group so much gaming pleasure for so little money. This is an outstanding game. A solid "10" in my book.

Neat little card-combo game. Every time you do an action, you get a little better at it, but there is a limit to how many times you can actually do an action, and then there's the thing about temples, which is also interesting.Lots of different options for how to build up your stuff. So far it seems like I've always been able to build up these exciting and successful moves and then I come in last, so clearly I am missing something (4 plays)

Comparing to other tableau-building game, the rules are simple and so are card effects. No complicated symbol, no card effects with time-lag/phase-dependent/... this aspect shines. Also, the fact that the first few cards are going to be repeatedly used is good.

Comparing with [thing=120677][/thing], in which many aspects have great snowball influences, Deus lacks some engine-building/nonlinear fun to make it great. The results of card effects are too clear in terms of final scores -- most of the cards feel like "play and score X", which X can be clearly computed, especially in the last half of the game. Thus make scoring feels linear and mechanical.

RATING: 6
The random card draw here was too much for me. The problem is that the cards are very restrictive in what they can do. I thought on paper this would be like a dumbed-down ZhanGuo, which is easily one of my favorite games. But the key difference in that one is that any card can be used for any action and you get equal numbers of the different colors. Here each discard action corresponds to a color, as does a huge portion of what building the card does for you. Thus the game just feels really uneven. The core mechanic is really cool, but because of the unevenness the game's not nearly as good as I was hoping.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
superb, unlike other card based games there's no such thing as a bad hand since discarding and drawing back up to 5 allows you to do powerful/useful/necessary things.

It can however be frustrating if you get stuck in a chain of constantly discarding when you really just want some cards that are useful to play with whatever strategy path you have gone down.

Otherwise this game is perfect.

Excellent mid-weight Euro. It feels a little similar to Bruges in that every card feels useful all the time, but you can't use all of them!

None of the paths to victory seem over- or under-powered. Like any good engine builder, it feels like the game ends JUST when you were on the verge of that really sweet big move. Great tension there.

Some people have said the art is a little dry, but I actually really like it. It has a very pleasing color palette throughout the card art, and they're very readable. The board is a bit dry looking, but I think that's a necessity to keep it easy to understand at a glance.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (April 2015)

I was expecting a good game from designer Sébastien Dujardin and I wasn’t disappointed. I really like games in which cards have different uses and Deus is one of those. You have to decide which cards are you going to play and which cards are you going to discard, it sounds simple, and it is rules wise, but it allows for interesting decisions (when to pray and to what god, when to play a card, when to build a temple, when to surround a barbarian village, when to get more buildings, how to pay for buildings.).

Deus offers a good mix of tactics (which card to play) and strategy (as every card you play can impact the game again and again.) It has some luck of the draw but I feel the game will be won by the best player not by luck. It offers a high replayability factor due to the variable setup, also there are many cards to explore.

The theme is good, and you feel like you are playing a civ game.

I think it is best with 3 players, with more I begin to feel the downtime although I won’t say no to a two player game of Deus. Playtime is relatively short.

The game components are ok, but the player boards seem flimsy and easy to damage. The central board is regular looking. The art is also ok but the color of the components is different in the cards and in the reserve, the worst offender is the wood that is depicted as green on the cards, but it is a brown disc in the game (money is green). This confused 100% of the players I played with (including me).

Bottom line, Deus is a good tableau building game that I’m willing to play, it has the potential to get an improved rating with more plays. Definitively a keeper in my game collection, I expect some expansions will come soon.

Tight design but lacked a fun factor.  Art was somewhat generic and boring. While the high luck factor can be mitigated to some degree through offering to the gods and "cycling" through the deck it was generally not fun to spend an entire turn essentially replenishing a wooden piece to your board and drawing cards. The engine building and chain reactions triggered by card placement were the most enjoyable elements of the game and were fun, but the core hex-based play of surrounding a barbarian camp did not really feel thematic and felt merely like an excuse to play cards from your hand. Further, the point values of the barbarian camps also seemed unbalanced - since the core objective of the game is to place buildings on the board and capture barbarian camps succeeding at doing so should be worth more points. Having the barbarian camp values at 3-6 points each made it feel they could be completely ignored while focusing just on tableau building.

Finally got to play this. The hype is true. The game is fantastic. Reminds me of a mix between RFTG and Terra Mystica. Dont understand why people say the game is purely tactical. I think the temples makes it so that it is important to focus your efforts on end game points. Also, you can build a great machine, where the bottom cards of a row isnt necesarily very powerfull at the time you place it, but becomes important as the game goes on. The card discard system works excellently as both a luck mitigation mechanism and also to make you make tough descisions about what to keep in your hand and what to offer.

Card-Combo tableau building combined with some board play. I enjoyed the game all right, but it didn't wow me. I seemed to have plenty to do with my cards each turn but my opponents spent many turns discarding. I suspect they were not quite seeing the possibilities. My fiance hated it. She thought it was "boring as hell". While I would happily play it again, I see no reason to own it without an enthusiastic local opponent.

The hard sheen of a generic theme and bland graphics doesn't help. While the game play isn't bad, the graphic design makes me sleepy....

Played May 2015

The second play didn't do much to change my opinion. In fact my rating dropped from 7 to 6. The game is far too dependent on card combos. You can easily find yourself in a poor position through no fault of your own. The engines are interesting to see, but the game does not reward good play as much as good luck. 

The game is also done a huge disservice by a couple of fantastic games that share some similarities to Deus. Namely ZhanGuo and Elysium. 

---------------------------------------------
Played Oct 2014

I wanted to like this one more, but I found the randomness of the cards a bit too much. Of course with more plays this complaint might go away. I found players often discarded their entire hand to draw up to 9 or 10 cards in order to have better options and also the ability to boost offerings to the gods. It felt like an odd rhythm to me. The map works really well and creates an arena for player interaction (none of which is overly negative). Setting up efficient combos is fun and exploring that space could be very interesting. There are a lot of options! But this also allows for the lucky draw of two synergistic cards while your opponent has to go digging for something useful. Overall I'm quite hopeful, but I wasn't sold on my first play.

----------------------------------------

Read rules Sept 22 2014.

The rules are simple but the gameplay appears to be deep. Players must manage their hands to gain resources and VPs. It's definitely a 'card combo' type of game like Innovation but likely a lot less chaotic. There is some negative interaction in the army cards, but it might not be enough to bother me. 

Definitely want to play this!

The Spiel ’14 title that made the biggest splash among my fellow gamers directly after the fair. Deus is a surprisingly quick-playing civ game that feels more like 7 Wonders than Civilization. The tableau building is combined with a dudes-on-a-map part although one dude can’t attack another player’s dude directly. Attacks are only indirect by stealing VP’s from neighboring players via cards played to the tableau. The only alternative action to playing cards to the tableau is sacrificing to the gods, i.e. discarding cards to one of the five development areas to get new buildings, resources, money etc. The challenge is to minimize the need to sacrifice cards by generating enough resources from the tableau.

The tableau building mechanism in combination with the unique discard mechanism creates plenty of replayability. At the same time, Deus is the cleanest Pearl Games title so far. Once explained, it plays smoothly. Thus, it might become the first game from this publisher to not only be a good game like Troyes or Ginkgopolis but to be played in years to come.

Wonderful game!  Interesting combos to be created with the cards.  Love the various 'sacrificing to the gods' choices (getting $, resources, cards, VP, or more buildings) and that you must sacrifice in order to get cards.

I really like how strategy and tactics are mixed as you try to play with your building activation combos and to get as much as possible out of your temples in the end, but at the same time you're sort of like at the mercy of your hand cards. But then again the hand card refreshing mechanisms allow you to rapidly change your direction. All in all I like how the card play is managed. I also like the map and the feel the expansion gives to the game. A negative side note comes from the color scheme: wood is both brown and green, brown buildings are actually orange and money tokens are also of different color than represented on the cards. I'm also going to remain eternally unhappy with getting a beige t-shirt when the picture on the preorder page had earlier showed it to be yellow.

2016-05-21 - 7 - Pretty cool civ-like game with low but existent interaction, where you try to make cool combos with your cards. We'll see how it will play after few more games.

2016-07-09 - 7->7.5 - I really like that you can make pretty cool combos in this game, but on the other hand you can't trigger them every turn making snowball effect. This one takes about an hour which is not too long, but makes you feel like you played some serious title.

2017-06-11 - 7.5->6 - After almost a year I played again and I like it less. You don't care that much about what others do. The cards are quite repetitive and after 3 plays the game doesn't offer too much surprises, while at the same time the way players play does not affect that much how the game feels. It's still OK.

Engine building and area control it is literal sense. It sounds fine in theory, but the actual game play is not as slick as I imagined.

Nevertheless, I still believe it has a potential to grow after several plays.

Glory To Rome meets Kingdom Builder, sort of. Some really good mechanics here, but also some major flaws. The game often feels random; the card draw can really make or break you, there should be something to mitigate that, like Glory To Rome allows you to use two cards of the same colour as any other colour. Also, the things the buildings do are all so bland. In GtR the buildings give you exciting powers, here it's all just resources, money and points - meh.

A stunning surprise.  The game is full of good options, but it plays quickly and is engaging throughout.  The rulebook could be better (and it bothers me that "wood" is green on cards but uses brown tokens), but I found no faults with the gameplay itself.  Okay, there is no theme, and I wish that we were using interesting new gods instead of tired old Roman ones.  Also, there is tons going on, so it is very easy to mis-apply rules.  But on the whole, an excellent game!

Not a civ game by any means. Its more of a resource efficiency euro with an emphasis on putting card combos together. Not bad, maybe a bit long for what its trying to do (so many similar games wrap it up much quicker). I found the production engine aspect frustrating as I didn't draw the cards to get my engine going early on. I tried to go a different way, to my serious disappointment. If the production engine is so important to the game, then why is my ability to set one up contingent on luck of the draw?

An excellent game with one minor drawback. It can be very aggressive, in fact aggressive play is almost essential and a player with a lucky draw of cards at the beginning of the game can dominate play leaving the other player(s) trying to catch-up. As with a lot of these games there are a few cards which seem (with repeated play) to be very powerful and collecting them will almost guarantee a win. However the game plays quickly and it is easy to play several games in which the luck evens out. It has some nice mechanisms and can be a lot of fun.

Such a simple, but still interesting. Nice mechanic to keep your engine "small enough" - what I mean here is, that when you've build your uber-engine, you can't use it anymore. A bit luck driven too, but I'm fine with that! Again, one of these games which I think is the best when played with three players. The fourth won't bring anything else than bring some more downtime.

In Deus, players work to develop their own civilizations in a shared environment. Each player starts the game with five building cards, and on a turn a player either uses one of these cards to construct a building or discard one or more cards to make an offering to a god. Cards come in six colors: red for military, green for resource production, blue for trade, brown for scoring, purple for temples, and yellow for a variety of effects.

RATING: 7.6


Tableu building combined with some building action on a map. Quite streamlined rules, enjoyable gameplay. In the beginning I felt I just don't draw the right cards and it's rather luck-dependent. Then a seasoned Deus played looked at my hand and said 'I would discard all these five cards, with the one with the house symbol on top, and draw 10 cards.' That's the only advice he gave me but the game opened up and suddenly I could see how to play it fine. I discarded and drew cards often, and in the end I did indeed secure a (great) win. But this is not the reason why I really liked this game and found it was one of the best gamer's games in 2014 (I was happy it got a KdJ recommendation) - it's simply a very good game.

An interesting Euro-style resource management game with some board tactics combinations.  Need to play again for better understanding of gameplay.

Update:  It's a bit dry and nothing exciting for me.  It doesn't hold my interest to fish for the proper cards that suit my main strategy or analyze what's the optimal move based on hand management.  I'd rather play Imperial Settlers as a "civilization card game".

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

I found this an enjoyable tableau building/combo game that plays in 45-60 minutes. Manage resources, buildings, cards, and money to gain the most points. There is luck of the draw but I'm not convinced it plays a huge role in the outcome of a game once people are familiar with game play and the cards.

08/2015 My wife and I played our first game of Deus yesterday. The game didn't play out as I expected. It's much harder than I expected it to be. There's luck of the draw, but the ability to offer your cards up for bonusses and new cards opens up all kinds of strategies and paths to victory. My wife had the better hand, or perhaps she figured the game out much faster than me and won.

Deus certainly has replay value. There must be countless different and interesting card combinations to figure out and explore. Then there's also the board and the area control aspect of the game which didn't come into play in our first session. This also opens up a lot of exciting gameplay possibilities. Deus is definitely a game I want to play a lot more of.

Dunque, da questo gioco mi aspettavo una gran sensazione di sviluppo e profondità.
Questo non è stato. E' un gioco di combo di carte.
Spesso quel che si fa con le carte da l'impressione di essere scollegato da quello che avviene sulla plancia.
Non era quindi quello che mi aspettavo ma ho scoperto un gioco diverso. Dura poco, un oretta, E' molto dinamico, prevalentemente tattico e offre sfaccettature particolari rispetto ai soliti giochi. E' molto divertente l'utilizzo delle carte e lo sviluppo della plancia. C'è un po' di ripetitività nelle carte, ma piu che sufficienti per godere del gioco per un po'. Poi necessiteranno espansioni.
Personalmente il gioco mi piace per questi aspetti:
E' veloce
E' bello da vedere
Ha un fighissimo sistema di utilizzo delle carte.
Non mi piace invece:
Pensavo che desse piu sensazione di sviluppo, che fosse un civ.
Tabellone e plancia personale sembrano essere troppo slegati, il gioco si svilupperà prevalentemente sulla plancia personale.

Quindi in definitiva il giudizio è positivo anche se mi aspettavo altro...
Credo che usciranno espansioni a breve...

The game favors combo card play and plays well enough, but it has a severe component color issue.

[see "Lee's BGG.CON 2014 Games of Interest" Geeklist]
Verdict: [b]Saving my tithe.[/b] First game played at BGG.CON 2014. It's a shame some of the colors on the pieces got mixed up as they don't align with the illustrations in the rule book, and they seem opposite of what they should be. Still it looks nice and plays well enough. It just didn't excite me as much as I thought it would. I can see how working towards certain combinations of cards can prove futile when the card distribution doesn't allow for one to find the right cards to play when needed. I'd gladly play this again, but it's not one I feel like I need to rush out and buy or own at the moment.

Deus is a dudes-on-a-map game where most of the dudes will never move or leave. It's also a tableau game in a way. It's kind of a mish-mash. It reminds me of Terra Mystica, only without that game's fussiness and inability to know when to stop adding elements. Similarly, it's a game that looks like it's going to be more interactive than it ultimately is, with the map not really adding much beyond tracking different resource spots. It's pretty hard to describe, but my general impressions of it were positive. I liked the combos that were possible, and I liked the multiple ways cards could be used. I'm used to tableau games in which you try to make the best of what you're dealt and didn't catch on quickly enough to the tactic of just whipping through your cards quickly to get better cards or other goodies. Deus is fine, and a solid title, but there's just something missing for me, something that would give it that little extra push. And I don't know what that is.

RATING: 6
Initial Impressions: This game's basic rules are very simple, there's just quite a few exceptions to them, and so I'm not sure yet if this game is really easy to learn or not. If it is easy to learn, I will be buying very few gateways in the future, as this game has quite a lot of depth for its simplicity. EDIT: the special cases to the overlying simple rules and also the feel of I have no idea what I'm doing with all the choices has made this harder to get people to play than I anticipated.

I've heard some people say this game is like Catan 2.0. To me, it took out all the parts of Catan I didn't like (the trading, early positioning being a big factor, not being to do anything on many turns, pace slowing robber locking down wood/stone in the early game) and added tableau building, more hand management, and more different paths to victory, as you could spam a different building type each game, or go with variety in order to build more temples that score many points. The only things I think it has a downfall to Catan is the lack of trading and robber decreases interaction, and I'm still not sure if changing up the modular board will affect the game that much, or if the game experience will still feel the same.

Others have said this game has very little interaction. I definitely don't think this game is multiplayer solitaire. Sure the army cards aren't exactly groundbreaking in their stealing of gold etc. effects, but boxing people in, building on/moving your armies onto terrain that they benefit from, and jockeying for the barbarian camp points make this game while I wouldn't say interaction still a competition.

EDIT: I've seen some comparisons to Imperial Settlers. To me, IS has one or two main strategies per faction, and you are trying to optimally play to that strategy with your limited card draw and the common buildings you have to make do with, whereas in Deus it feels more Race for the Galaxy-esque where it is very open ended at least intially and you need to know what cards benefit your tableau the most, and when if at all you should start specializing. Also, IS combos are a lot of the nature of chaining your card play, making sure this gives you this so you can build this, etc. together since you can't save resources most of the time, whereas Deus you might do something because it gives you a large stockpile of stuff to use later down the road. In terms of interaction, it doesn't seem to be the strong suit of either, but I never understood people who didn't like the razing in IS, because I thought the game actually had too little interaction and most of the times outside the draft I didn't often didn't care/couldn't influence what my opponents did, whereas in Deus the interaction is not as apparent but building this first before this ensures you can't mess me up by taking my land, notwithstanding the grab for barbarian camp VPs. I also really like games with a spatial aspect which obviously IS is missing, though I really liked in IS the factions were really assymetrical. Both games are not super strong on their themes although I think the board helps Deus in that regard, whereas while IS asymmetry gave the feel of unique factions it felt more like a bunch of card chains rather than civ building. Finally, both games kind of hit newcomers in the face a bit too hard with the wealth of initial options, which I think makes it give a bad first impression and makes both harder to get to the table than I would like. 

EDIT 2: I've noticed it is difficult for beginners to do much better than a trivial 2 points/turn that you could otherwise achieve by discarding brown cards every turn. Also there are a lot of different cards, but they are all just variations of similar effects (e.g. 1 point for every forest you occupy vs. 1 point for every swamp). While it still has the Race for the Galaxy aspect of having to be flexible with your strategy based on the cards you get, the cards themselves just aren't that interesting, and the spatial aspect while important doesn't feel that way due to the passiveness of the interaction.

This was a surprise discovery that I've absolutely loved every time I've played. I find additional levels of complexity every time I play as well. At this point, I've played 7 games, 5 of which I've won. Thanks to Josh for introducing me to it while I was down in St. Louis earlier this Spring! This was the epitome of the instabuy. The way you use cards and the decisions you have to make about the cards is absolutely fantastic, and the game really does become a very strategic race to expand and grow your engine.

A tableau management game where you are playing various color cards to gain abilities in these areas.  You play them to gain locations out on the board which allow you to score points.  The art in the game is ok.  I liked the game and it was very solid.  However, it does seem that the art detracts from the experience.  This might be a good game to acquire in a second printing the updates it.

If you go in with a plan in mind, you're screwed.  This is about reactive play, and is rather dependent on card draw.  The 2 player game seems like it will always end via barbarian victory, thereby nullifying temples to some degree.  We found we would always prefer Race for the Galaxy or Imperial Settlers for this type of combo engine building, Innovation or Glory to Rome for the combo-rific randomness, and Concordia for card play with a board.

First impression after one play.  This is an excellent game combining tableau/engine building with a spatial board element and with a good degree of player interaction.  My first impression is that the game has many viable strategies and that the interaction among the players will make it feel fresh even with repeated plays.  My main concern is with the stifling effect of the card draw -- sometimes you will be unable to pursue/complete a certain strategy or be seduced into pursuing a different one by the luck of the draw.  In spite of this negative, the game was very enjoyable, of a very good length, an excellent game that I look forward to playing again to see if the excellent first impression holds.

I appreciate games like this that have a fairly simple structure, but allow for a wide variety of decision-making.

This is easily my most played game from Essen 2014. Gameplay is so smooth and rewarding. The tableau/engine building is beautiful from its core; play a card, build a building on the map, do actions: this feels very satisfying. The gameplay is fast and simple in a good way. Yes, there is luck involved, but i feel it is exactly the right amount. Always play with the 'wildcard variation' mentioned on the last page of the rulebook. 
Deus scales extremely well from 2 to 4 players. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
After two games with three players, I can understand why this made such a splash at Essen’14. Deus has a lot of immediate appeal, owing to a simple and well-presented set of rules, and nice components (apart from an unfortunate gaffe with the resource markers for wood). While it is a tableau-building game at heart, the tie to the map is very well done, and the opportunities for blocking your neighbours or leeching stuff from them add a level of interactivity that makes this something special.

Probably the smartest thing here is the option to discard part of your hand for a nice reward and then draw back up to 5 cards – similarly to Race for the Galaxy’s use of cards as money, this ensures that there are no truly bad hands, just bad decisions.

Although they do not play very similarly, Race is a good point of comparison regarding game length, decision density and, possibly, the role of skill vs. luck. If Deus turns out to be as nigh-perfectly balanced as well, it could very well be one of the greats.

The card combos are too bland so my interest in playing this game continues to drop off.  Went from an 8 on my first play to a 7 after 12 plays. Might have been more interesting if your buildings or the board were more important.

I really wanted to enjoy this game a little more, but the luck of draw is frustrating.  Your entire strategy can be easily be dictated by what cards you draw and if you do anything outside of that strategy, you are likely not to score any points.

The decision making part is really fun. But the can have a lot of downtime, where the decision of others normally does not change your situation much (so is not interesting).

Really, really ugly game.  What is the point of the rounded tile thingy?  The cards are garish.  And we don't get to play Gods, but only try to please them.  Again.  We have to collect resources and turn them into point scorers.  Again.  Complete solitaire game, and I had no idea what the other players were doing.  Sometimes somebody would steal some money or something, but that was it.  Artwork not very evocative.

A civilization game with a cool engine building mechanic where you activate all your previous tech of the same type as you build new ones. However you can only build a certain amount of the same type, so eventually you'll run all out of that tech and you have to focus on something else. Due to the temples requiring you to do a little bit of everything, it's always a tough choice of focusing on one thing, or spreading out more.

Adding to this is an area control bit on the map that I didn't enjoy as much as I did the card play.

I love games with card combo's, but this games bothered me because of the random card draw. You need green cards or boats in het beginning to build your engine.

Extremely beautiful to look at, but the game itself.... meh. A game of conquest with virtually no player interaction. "Warfare" consists of siphoning off victory points from victory-point depots, uh I mean barbarian villages. Ships, oddly, don't move, just armies. Pleasant enough just because triggering those stacks of cards is appealing. It's extremely easy to get stuck with lousy or unbuildable cards, then toss them in to get fresh cards... and get another handful of useless cards. Weird game: it feels very awkward, a quality that it shares with Tournay, by the same designer (as well as the fact that the most fun card in both games is the Ballista). So far I've been disappointed by everything Dujardin's done after the superb Troyes.

I didn't like the gameboard and the visual style of the game that much. The board looks oddly abstract and random, plus I didn't like the overall colour scheme of the cards and player boards, felt a bit bland. Plus there is really no theme to speak of, you just build stuff onto the squiggly gameboard and try to get your combomachine working. It also felt a bit solitairish, even though there is a pinch of area controlling.

What makes Deus unique is the brilliant link between board and cards. Play cards from your hand to replenish your supply of resources, buildings, cards, money or victory points. Use your supply to develop or expand on the board. Reuse your played cards as each newly played triggers old cards as well to build a powerful engine. Or discard your entire hand to earn divine favors.

This game is much deeper than the first impression may tell you and deserves a higher rating than its current 400+ position.

I am also not a fan of the board design, but Tom Vasel's enthusiastic review of the card play in this one has caught my interest. After watching Richard Ham's runthrough I've upgraded this to "like to have" and it may eventually move to "love to have" as it is hovering on the edge as it is. I do like the interaction of the cards and that discarding cards garners new resources in addition to renewing the cards in your hand.

Celui qui m'a présenté le jeu a parfois tendance à oublier certaines règles lorsqu'il est lui-même peu habitué aux jeux qu'il présente. Peut-être ai-je joué à une version incomplète du jeu? Toujours est-il que pour ce qui est de l'expérience de jeu à proprement parlé, on repassera...

Les cartes détenues au début du jeu semblent avoir un impact important sur la manière dont la partie prendra son envol. L'idée d'une chaine d'action peut sembler attrayante en soi, encore faut-il avoir ce qu'il nous faut au moment opportun. S'il faut défausser nos cartes à répétition "à la chasse aux combos", c'est alors que quelque chose ne fonctionne pas correctement; cette perte de temps pourrait à elle seule compromettre les chances sérieuses de rester dans la partie.

Et que dire une fois de plus d'un enchainement de conversions, une idée qui est de moins en moins originale et excitante...

Et comme cela m'arrive on dirait trop de fois ces temps-ci, je retiens de mon expérience de jeu que j'ai eu les yeux rivés sur mes cartes en main et devant moi, avec quelques petits coups d'oeil sporadiques sur le plateau de jeu (de toute manière pas si agréable à contempler), et à peu près aucun intérêt à observer ce qui se trame sur les zones de jeu adverses.

Mais ce qui a tué ma motivation, c'est de vivre cinq derniers tours d'une partie où je ne pouvais rien faire comme tel, sinon défausser ma main pour deux points de victoire et espérer piocher une meilleure nouvelle main.

Bien curieux de voir comment on pourrait me convaincre qu'il y a réellement place à de la stratégie dans Deux.

Un (autre) jeu multisolitaire; une autre note en deçà de mes attentes.

A very well-made tableau building card game. There are a lot of ways for you to play the game, consider the liqudiity of the cards. Sometimes you just hold onto the cards you like as they somehow work with each other, sometimes you just keep throwing cards away to try searching for a specific card you need. In this regards, the game may seem to be a bit random, but utilizing the cards and the game clock is the key of a game.

I enjoy thinking how to use the various cards and options in the game. I am also amazed by the fact that no cards are truely bad, it's all about sequencing your cards.

Solid engine builder. I think there's a bit of luck in the card draw and in who ends up building near you to hurt you, but even still, I relatively enjoyed it. The engine building was pretty neat with the whole "activate everything in the column you placed prior". I think I also just really like engine builder games as its fun being more productive.

Plays: 1

Notes on whether to buy or not: I dislike the luck of the draw, and lack of strategy - its moreso tactical whether to draw into a good working combo or not, and then itll come to luck who drew it earlier. Solid game but not one to be added to my collection and extremely unlikely to hit my top 10.

After second play issues: too much luck of card draw whether you get a synergistic temple and such. And card effects shouldve been constant. Ex discard settlement and always get just a static 5 resources. This lets players keep good cards in their hand while gwtting the resources they need but not falling behind and not relying on card draws

During my first plays, I was not convinced by this game. I felt it dry. I continue to play it because it plays fast (around one hour). The more I play the more I like it. I prefer to play with two players. With more players, the game is longer and in all the cases I have the sensation that I play in my corner even if you have to watch the position of other players in the board. I like the choice to do with your cards. You are never blocked and can always do something. What a great idea the discard of your cards to call a god!

Das Spiel hat mir sehr gut gefallen. Es handelt sich um ein Zivilisationsaufbauspiel (schon mal per se gut) mit sehr geringer konfrontativer Mission (auch ganz in meinem Sinne). In erster Linie geht es darum, Gebiete mit Gebäuden zu besetzen und dadurch Barbarendörfer auszumerzen. Bei einem Spiel mit diesem Namen ist natürlich naheliegend, dass auch die Götter eine Rolle spielen: durch Opfer an fünf verschiedene Götter kann man verschiedene Dinge erreichen (Ressourcen, Geld, Gebäude/Truppen, Karten, Siegpunkte). 
Insgesamt sehr stimmig und angenehm zu spielen.

The thematic pasting of Roman mythology to Agricola felt a little awkward to me... but this is an otherwise very solid game, enjoyable with either 2, 3 or 4 players. Possible actions are very simple, but there is still some complexity in the sequencing of decisions. The game flows very smoothly with extremely rare AP downtimes... but to the expense of limited interactions between players.

RATING: 3
Deus reminds me of a stripped down version of Terra Mystica. Simplified in many ways, it is more accessible to new players.

I like the mechanisms in Deus, but it is fundamentally flawed: The only way to activate existing buildings in your tableau is to play a new building card of the same type. This may mean that, 2/3rds of the way through the game when most of a particular building type is removed from the deck, it is possible to be locked out of any meaningful action by not being able to trigger the ability to gain the necessary resources.

The designers must have experienced this in playtesting because they offered a variant where you can play any building face down to an existing building type to trigger that ability. While this may solve the aforementioned problem it will open a new series of issues where certain combos can be exploited to a ridiculous extent. Rectifying this would require a complete reexamination of the card deck.

Deus is a neat, but half-baked game.

Yeah, I've hit the point.  I'm done with mid-weight Euros for the foreseeable future.

Deus connects all the same generic city-building dots in a slightly different generic way.  It plods along at a comfortable pace, and then you count your points, and of course there's lots of ways to score those points so it feels neck-and-neck until the end.

Except at this point, it's an illusion.  That approach just masks a too-tight engine and if any action can lead to a victory, then no actions hold weight.  At least in Splendor I can see where I went off-path and lost to a more nimble opponent.  This one?  Nope.  Not at all.  Just more beige characters taking more beige actions.

Also, it's small, but it didn't help: Dull brown discs to represent the green grass/forest on the board?  YOU HAD ONE JOB, LIGHT GREEN DISCS.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.6
Deus is basically an engine building game about comboing cards, with very cool mechanics, the star being all the discard options. Everything together create a very attractive environment, with many possible actions each round, plenty of decissions to make, everyone of them quite meaty.

The rules are very elegant, brief, easy to teach, and they create no complex or limit situations: you won't need the manual again. 

An interesting feature is that the cards can cycle very fast, that reduces the luck factor (still present, though). Still, it's mostly strategic/tactic.

The games are not short, but you get to do a lot of turns. You will be busy during the offturn thinking your move, and usually thee will be almost zero waiting time. Even if you interact on the main board, it feels a bit like a "solo multiplayer", you just care about your combos and you just see what others do on a global level, because otherwise it would increase the game lenght and the waiting time considerably.

The theme is quite artificial, the cards have nice illustrations, but the modular map is not my cup of tea. I played the online version, I don't know about qualities.

The card play and the card engine are brilliant: There is always something that can be done with the cards, even if it is not exactly the thing you were hoping for. There is always a shortage of resources, money, or playing pieces to build the card or run the engine you'd want. The cards do create some AP occasionally.

Quite a lot of direct player interaction in the form of stealing, blocking, and cleaning out the barbarians but it is tuned to such a level that it does not [i]constantly[/i] dominate the gameplay, so there is enough time to concentrate on the engine part as well. 

The graphic design is not on par with the gameplay: Card play is needlessly cumbersome because of incorrectly colored icons and cards. The overall bland looks are emphasized by the generic shapes of the wooden pieces. I also get unavoidable Attika vibes because of the Attika-shaped tiles and the whole blockage concept but that is of course not really a flaw per se ;P

I actually kind of enjoyed the escalating gameplay of this as you start really slow but due to the chaining of the cards can pull of pretty nice combos after a while, which is something I usually enjoy a lot. 

So on paper this all seems pretty good, but I'm missing interaction here a bit, which is not really "solved" for me by the military units that let you interact more directly. 
Eventually this feels very solitary when playing as everyone is building up their own engine which doesn't affect the others much, so it comes down to everyone starring a lot at their own cards with an eventual "I get 2 coins from you" until someone triggers the end.

I need to try it a little more if it gets better and it's not like I really dislike the game, I just expected a little more.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I ended up getting a copy of this game and have enjoyed further plays much more. It has been a hit with my son and older daughter (she's 10), we can get a game in a little over an hour which is great. RftG is still my favorite tableau builder, but both Deus and Elysium have pushed Imperial Settlers out of our collection. There can definitely suffer from a run of bad draws, but I expect that to happen occasionally with a card game such as this.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I need to start by saying that I really enjoyed my play of Deus and look forward to playing again. It is an interesting take on tableau building; once a card is built in a certain color it will get activated every time a new card is built in that color. This really opens up the game play and strategies/tactics you can employ. You are trying to create an efficient tableau so that you can maximize each activation of your cards (they will only be activated 1 to 5 times during the game). I also do not have a problem with the aesthetics of the game, I like the card art and wooden buildings and the tiles are fine. 
The one concern I would have is playing it with more than 3, I have a feeling that the game would drag (similar to Imperial Settlers).

*The question you may be asking is why did I remove it from my wishlist. It has nothing to do with the game itself, it is more a statement of where my collection is at the moment. I have a lot of games that while not exactly similar scratch the same itch as Deus (Race for the Galaxy, Imperial Settlers, San Juan (second edition) and to a lesser degree The Golden Ages). Add to that the fact that one of my friends has a copy so I know I will get to play it.[/i]

Interesting. In one sense it's the standard get resources, build buildings, generate VPs Euro. The earlier you can get an effect into your tableau, the more you'll be able to trigger it. But any engine you build can only be iteratively triggered if you specialise in one colour. And there are lots of buildings which instead reward points for getting a spread of colours. Making for choices between specialisation and generalisation. I like how the dumping of cards gives you various types of outs, allowing you to forego a turn (and the building of those cards) so that you can acquire whatever you're missing (resources, cards, buildings, VPs). And that you're not dependent on building an exact card effect engine to deliver everything you need to get to the finish line. Which gives lots of options, and provided perhaps the most innovative aspect of the game. I'd happily play again to explore it further.

This game mixes area control with a civilization card game, trying to keep everything as simple as possible. On the one hand this is good since it can be played in about one hour, on the other hand it does not feel that epic. Still there are a lot of tactical and strategic decisions to be made and in the end you are usually proud of the empire you built.

Unfurtunately Deus is quite ugly. But the mechanics are nicely built and the game works well. I like the dual use of the cards, and this is one of the few area-control games that agree with me. There are some card combos that are very strong, and drawing the right cards is essential so the game is therefore quite random. 

This was one of the EuropeMasters games 2015, and after practicing for the competition for several weeks you get fed up of those games.

Based on one play: There is a little more to this game then the explanation puts forth as the cards are designed to make combinations but these are not always obvious at first. Also hand management is huge as you must sacrifice cards to gain items (money, resources, more cards, etc) so you must decide which cards to hold onto. All in all, it is okay, but there are much better games in the genre.

In Deus, players play cards to activate its ability as well as the abilities of all the other cards of that color that they’ve previously played, as well as place a token on the map board. However, a card cannot be played if the player doesn’t have a corresponding token in his supply--and you only start with two of each. To gain more tokens, players must discard one or more cards in his hand, which also grants a special ability based on the color of one of the chosen cards. The interaction on the map board is not very confrontational--not only can you not destroy another player’s token, you can even put a token on a space occupied by an opponent, as long as it’s a different token type. The game really is about trying to create card combos, and figuring out ways to use them as many times as possible, which can present a conundrum as the card that you’d play to activate the combo is also the card that you’d play to gain more tokens of that type. I found the breadth of card combos that you could create and the interesting decisions that the game presented you to be very engaging.

It's a light civ builder with interesting card combos. I almost overlooked this one, but I'm glad I gave it a shot. The first few plays reminded me of Kingdom Builder as the card draw felt unnecessarily restrictive. As I've played further, those concerns have faded. It also plays extremely well across all player counts. 2 might be a little too quick depending on how fast you build your temples, but it keeps a nice tight map as it's modular based on player count. Lots of room for different strategies and depending on the temples, your strategy changes to fit.

7 Wonders + San Juan + Settlers = Deus: alright game but not great.

One 3-player and one 4-player game.

Reading the rules, I was like "yeah, this should be fun". When playing it was less than great. Interesting, but not overly so. 

colors of building type and terrain/resource type have no connection. Except for blue: boat (maritime building) and sea terrain. I think they could have skipped Colors and use something else for destinguish building types..

Deus is a combination tableau-building/area control game with solid mechanics and a pretty thin theme. Players add cards to their individual tableaus to place buildings onto a shared board and take actions such as collecting resources, drawing more cards, etc. The cards come in 5 colors, each keyed to a particular building type and when players add, for example, a yellow card to their tableau, they get to trigger the effect of the added card as well as all other yellow cards already present in the tableau. This gives the game an engine-building feel as well as allowing players to set up productive card combinations. Both of these aspects appeal to me in general, and were the most attractive part of Deus. 

While there can be moderate to significant interaction among players on the board, the tableau exercises seem relatively solitaire. Sometimes choosing and executing actions can take some thought, so there is also a fair amount of downtime in the game. This is something I look forward to playing again, but not a game I need to own for now.

After Games with 3 and 4 Players. Very tense! Especially with four Players the space seems to be more limited as with three, but this does not annoy. Great Game from start to finish. The Luck Factor you have because of the Cards, ist negated, because of the sacrifice mechanism which worlks really fast, and as everyone has to sacrifice at one time or another during the game, this doesn't slow down a Player. Great Game. Hope to test  it with 2p soon.

Not sure yet about this one: I love games were you have to look for combo's between different cards (I adore Seasons). However in this game I have the impression that only 1 type of cards really matters and that are cards that give you victory points (the points from Barberian villages seem to be only peanuts). Other cards are just used to 'feed' those cards. That means that if you can't get these, you simply won't win.

Have to see if this is conformed with repeated play.

Solid medium weight Euro, can be accessible but deep enough to satisfy a wide audience. Catan-like resource gathering (but no dice, card discarding) and purchasing, hand management (buildings granting abilities, bonuses, combos, etc). Combo building a bit like Race for the Galaxy, San Juan. Modular board, works well with all player counts.

-Familiarity with card powers and combos have a distinct advantage. Card driver, luck of the draw compounds card combo creation. Low interaction, more of a solitaire race, but there are some aggressive cards towards other players (Carebear players beware). Can be AP prone, and sometimes because there is little to do.

RATING: 9
This is a game that feels like a cross between Innovation in terms of the card play and settlers of catan in terms of the board positioning. In general the game works like this. Cards are drawn from a random deck and are played into splayed stacks based on color, or discard to get more buildings and draw new cards. When you play into a stack, you activate the whole stack from bottom to top, so you can get some neat little engines going. The restriction is, you need to be able to place a building on the map to place a new card, and you can't activate a stack without placing a new card on that stack. This means you are limited in that each stack can only happen as many times as you have buildings for that stack, and so long as you have room to place the building.

An engine builder that makes you think. Multiple paths and strategies to victory, but you need more than one engine to power the boat.

In Deus, there are two overlapping games happening. On one hand, you are purchasing and playing cards from your hand, generating their effects to gain resources. At the same time, when you build a card, you place a building of the corresponding type of your color onto the map, claiming territory. These buildings come from your pool, which you have to draw from by making sacrifices to the Roman gods, using the cards in your hand (which is also the mechanisms to regenerate your hand) to both gain more buildings to play in the future, and gain various unique benefits based on the number of cards sacrificed. At the same time, every time you play a new building of a previously played color, you reactivate all of those color cards, building tiny little engines.

But once you've played all five of your buildings of a type, that engine shuts down, never to be utilized again. As such, the game has a wonderful synergy flow of territory control, resource management, and VP acquisition, all in conjunction with two means of ending the game, and definite control over whether or not this occurs when you want it to.

In the past I've tried strong military tactics where I blitz the barbarian tribes to force an early endgame, and others where I've stalled as long as possible to build up temples and accrue massive sums of VP that way. This game does everything I want in a game and I'm eager to get more plays in.

I'm going to be honest. This is the first time I've ever felt this way about a game. Usually I either like a game or I don't. This game is different. I really enjoy it. But if I had to pick a card driven game off the shelf I would pick Imperial Settlers, 51st State, Terraforming Mars, Seasons, Race for the Galaxy, Mystic Vale, Clank, Marvel Legendary, Coal Baron the Card Game, and maybe a couple others in my collection. It sucks, because I do enjoy it, but I don't think it will get off the shelf unless someone else asks for it. There are some cool features like the combos you can make from concentrating on a certain color scheme. The things that make this game less enjoyable are the artwork and resources. Not a fan. Also, the Barbarian raids are kind of anti-climatic. However; I have only played this at two players, and me and my wife tend to steer clear of each other and do our own thing unless we have an understanding that we are supposed to war it out. So that could make this better if I played with 3 players and there were some real challenges for the barbarian villages. Bottom line, this is a tough choice, but I might hang on to this one for a year until another amazing game makes me make space on my shelf. **Wife:7

I give some credit to Deus for trying to take a serious civ-building game and cramming it into an hour long package, but I was not a fan of the combo-based card play, mostly because it becomes a lesson in down time. Each players turn gets longer as the game goes on, and the combos that they create aren't necessarily interesting or impactful, just time consuming. The game ends when a number of temples are built or the barbarians are all ransacked, but even this is a tedious endeavor since you are usually waiting on one capable person to finally pull the trigger. Even the layout of the board seems to be based on one cool idea, poorly executed, as I can see no good reason for the abstract puzzle pieces which don't provide any variety or interesting decisions from their placement.

Really, this is not a terrible game, but I would never go out of my way to play it over much better titles. For a fast light civ game, I recommend The Golden Ages.

I don't think that Deus is a bad game by any stretch, and it has some interesting mechanisms - activating an entire row of cards is fun. But, ultimately, I find myself wanting to like it more than I actually do. I think the reason is the "Offering to the Gods" mechanism. I feel like I'm constantly using many of my turns only to discard cards try to get better cards to fit in with the strategy I'm pursuing. I realize that discarding is a key mechanism of the game, but using your entire turn to discard cards to try to get better cards is just not very fun.

We got this game for Christmas 2014, and played it 3 times in early January - all 2p with me against my wife - and while I had expected a fun little game, this exceeded all my expectations. Very quick-playing, yet full of decisions - and predominantly card-based, although with a few significant elements related to board position. It's quick, but the decisions felt too "meaty" to call this a light game.

I could potentially see this one getting quite a lot of play - yet for some reason we've not played it the whole year since. (Ah, the problems of having too many games, and buying new ones more quickly than you can play the old ones...)

(+) Elegant gaming mechanics, interesting ideas

(-) Too random with luck of the draw. You risk not being able to put your engine to good use when suitable cards which allow to activate a certain color don't come out

(-) Gameflow is broken. Sometimes everything runs smoothly and the game takes you on a fun and wild ride, but suddenly this dynamic stops and the game doesn't offer you any more possibilities in certain situations.

(-) I generally prefer games which offer a multitude of good options with the challange to pick the best one over games which at certain points don't offer you any good possibilities.

Deus has that Glory to Rome tableau building feel to it, but without the off-the-wall crazy stuff. It also has that Terra Mystica 'build-up or build-out' feel to it, but without the computation. The combination of the two works in what is a fairly light tactical slash strategic game, but I'm not sure it is as exciting as I was hoping it would be.

I found that the game could be a bit frustrating when you randomly don't draw a color you need, many turns in a row, and thus cannot (effectively) gain any of the bonuses associated with that color -- building a building in that column (other than the bad vanilla devault), gaining the discard effect, or allowing the next level of temple.  I think this is mostly (but not entirely) addressed by using one of the variants where you get unlimited vanilla buildings per game.

Also, there are many cases where iconography, component colors, and terminology are disastrously poorly chosen, confusing otherwise simple game effects.  If a new edition fixes those superficial but hindering qualities, I would probably buy it.  In every single game I've played, I've made a play mistake because I thought I didn't have wood because it is green on the cards and brown on the components.

This seems like such a good tableau-building game, but I could never get behind it. Your success is so dependent on the card drawing that it just drove me crazy.  I could never seem to get the cards that I wanted to make the good combos that I was looking for, even when I spent turn after turn doing nothing but draw 10 cards.  When the card combos in your tableau work, then it is super fun.  But most of the time it doesn't work out!  Jeff really liked this game, but it was too luck-based for me to enjoy.

First impression is not the best: I expected a fast and easy civilization game with at least some interaction between players. In my one and only 3-player-game I saw a cardgame with a high luck factor (drawing cards) and really poor interaction. Didn't feel like a civilization game. The Essen premature praise is gone. Nevertheless an interesting mixture of mechanics. Let's see what further plays will bring.

Deus is an amazing game that I will soon have. If can't procure it through trade, I'll just buy it outright. It is that good, one of my favorites from 2014. I thought it was a very similar game to Imperial Settlers. For one, it is a vastly superior design in every aspect. I really liked the board implementation and the visual progress that crescendos as you play. The cardplay is simple and clever, there's quite a bit of player interaction regardless of what some people say. It's subltle but it's definitely not a multiplayer solitaire. My only complain goes to some of the components, which feel quite cheap. The wooden pieces are ok but the main and player boards feel underproduced. This should be a $30 at the most imo. Regardless, gameplay is beautiful and I can't wait to put in some work.

After 3 plays: One of my favorite games atm. I really like this design, it's soo clever. I also think it is very Thematic im the way the action carries out on the board, based on the card played. The set activation is soo satisfying and it can be very strategic, in the timing of when you play the right card in order to activate the entire row. But then you also want to have cards of every type to facilitate the construction of Temples. Temples are very important, as they give you end game focus and act as a trigger to end the game. Really good design.

At least for my family this is the new 'Settlers of Catan', or better the 'Settlers' for the 21st century. Fantastic gameplay, accessible and different strategies/tactics. Don't get me wrong, this is not Terra Mystica (not because it is inferior but lighter), but it has the same vibes.

What I don't get, is that the publisher managed to make the game as unattractive as possible for family type gamers. The box art is meh at best, the landscape tiles look strange and then the error with the brown wood tokens (the tiles and cards use green). The cards are gorgeous and functional, the meeples are functional, but the rest is a failure from marketing standpoint. If Kosmos or Pegasus would have designed the look of the game, it would have been a greater success.

If on your first game of something, you have no idea what you're doing, that's not necessarily a deal breaker for me - it can make me come back if I feel an inkling of "oh, now I get it! That's how everything comes together!". But in this game it was kind of frustrating, I don't know why. Maybe because I was the only one who'd never played. Coupled with severe solitary gameplay, that's not a good combination to keep me coming back. 
And then it's so luck-dependent! Sometimes there really isn't much you can do at all, cycling through cards, dumping what you can't use (yet! You may need it later, damn, but it's very probable it will never come back!) just to get buildings you don't even need...
Look, I'm not always opposed to games that are multiplayer solitaire. But they must to offer a little "secondhand interaction" at least. In Paperback, for example, you get to look at the words everyone else makes from their cards, sometimes you cheer for them or think, "damn, why didn't I think of that!". Dominion (base game) on the other hand, which is actually a very very similar game, but without the words, offers me nothing beyond "oh, cool combo, I guess" as interaction between players (oh, and a quick throwaway "Nope, moat..."). And Deus falls into that second Dominion category, unfortunately - I didn't really look at what everyone else was doing with their cards, I just checked where everybody's game pieces were on the map so I could see where to put mine. That may have been because it was my first game, but also, I just didn't care - the same thing happens to me in Dominion.

There's a very Ginkgopolis feel to this one. Like in that game you're chaining resource production effects as you build card types. This takes it a step further (and up a notch), and incorporates a loose civilisation building theme into the proceedings. (Throw in a touch of Masons to boot.) All the while the complexity remains very low. Easy to learn, teach and play. There's enough clever plays you can make that you're not totally left to the mercy of the card draw. Certainly the simplicity of the system makes it very attractive for any collection. I'm enjoying this one for a light romp.

Deus is a tableau building game with some interesting ideas. I like the option to pitch your hand for one of several benefits. While there is still luck in the card draws, this option helps mitigate bad draws to some extent. There are competing incentives for building out vs. building up, and the players have some control over the pace of the game. The lack of player interaction  and the variance in card value hold this title back.

This is one of the ugliest games I've seen in awhile.  I can't believe the final product got approved by quality control.  Cards that produce wood (round brown disc) have green for forest on them.  At least have some continuity.

Play cards to build a tableau of powers and construct a network on a board. The innovative thing here is that discarding cards is not a throwaway but a tough decision on what benefits to aim for.

Interesting take on card-driven mechanics to power a 'civ' in the vein of Race for the Galaxy, Glory to Rome et al, but I'm a little leery of the conservative card combos (they're mostly permutations of resources, and there are several copies of each card) and lack of meaningful player interaction besides blocking with networks. Might have limited legs.

A very solid game that was more enjoyable than I expected.  I like how the cards interact and how you can't build temples unless you diversify.  Multiple ways that the game can end also add a nice level of tension.  Could definitely go up with additional plays.

Well, after 40+ plays, this one has gone way down for me.  Military seems really unbalanced and I'm surprised that this one has dropped so far for me as I am a big fan of Dujardin's work.  I have little to no desire to play this anymore, though I can appreciate what was attempted here.

RATING: 6
Deus is a civ-lite game with a focus on cardplay as well as some elements of board manoeuvring. Where Deus excels is in its mechanism of triggering card effects in a cascade. It's brilliant in its simplicity, yet any tendency to snowball is reined in by the strict preconditions for building temples.

But while the way effects are [i]triggered[/i] is interesting, the actual effects that [i]can be triggered[/i] are less so. The lack of creative and varied card effects results in rather underwhelming combos for a game of this complexity. It's a telling sign when the obnoxious tactic of draining the resource pool also happens to be the most creative move. Limited opportunities for meaningful player interaction and a questionable colour scheme don't do the game any favours either. 

I've had the fortune of playing this several times over the years, but I can safely say that this is a design I wouldn't miss.

Lapkijátszós, kombózós, területfoglalós játék a Deus. Nagyon dicsérték hazai körökben, én annyira nem ájultam el tőle. Érdekes dolog, ötféle lapunkból csak ötöt-ötöt játszhatunk ki, így nagyon nem mindegy melyiket mikor, ugyanis minden korábban letett lap az adott színből újra használható, mikor a következő ugyanolyan színűt lerakjuk. Viszont, ha már lent van az öt belőle, onnantól annak vége. Így pl. a nyersanyag szerző lapok különös figyelmet érdemelnek, hisz a velük szerzett anyagokból épülnek a további épületeink. Igaz ugyan, hogy pénzből is lehet építeni, de szerintem az nehezebb út. A katonai lapok különösen erősek lehetnek, de mindegyik szín fontos és értékes. Egyedüli bajom a játékkal a szerencse szerepe. Persze első játék volt, de katonai kártyából az egész játék során összesen kettőt sikerült felhúznom így úgy éreztem esélyem sincs az első helyre. Persze lehet nem a legoptimálisabban használtam ki a lehetőségeimet, de úgy érzem bőven van szerepe a szerencsének. Nem rossz játék a Deus, de valahogy nem nyűgözött le annyira, mint amilyen híre volt.

One of those games where I did the research and thought it was going to be great, and it just fell flat.  I like that you can do so many things with the cards, but the problem is that unlike games where you can have several options that you want to do with multi-use cards, this one gave me lots of options but I just didn't want to do many of those actions.  Many turns would go by that I just felt like I didn't do anything on, and that was the issue.  Oh well.

4人局，第一次玩大概花了兩個小時，不過大家都在規劃自己手牌的路線和combo，沒有什麼冷場。
不愧是[company=12884][/company]的年度新作，美術很讚沒話說，遊戲性也相當高，不同路線的特色有做出來，鼓勵玩家追求同顏色的combo，同時也用建築物token的數量和蓋神殿的五色限制來要求玩家兼顧個路線的平衡。不同於[thing=68448][/thing]或是[thing=19857][/thing]的卡片combo，這遊戲還加上地圖上的區域發展和控制，多了一層思考，也讓遊戲多了一點樂趣。武力系統主要用來打NPC的野蠻人村莊，雖然有些卡片會搶奪其他玩家的分數或黃金，不過強度不會太高，所以攻擊性和針對性不會太強(看看[thing=25613][/thing]體面退出遊戲的設計...)，對玩家比較友善。棄牌的設計非常有趣，讓玩家猶豫手上的牌要多打一些建築，還是要多留幾張提升棄牌的好處，是個人最喜歡的亮點。
遊戲規則簡單，卡片交互作用變化多，文字也不會太複雜，地圖上的發展讓玩家有許多互動。熟悉之後可以是很輕快的中度策略遊戲，喜歡！
:star::star::star::star::halfstar:

Another great title from [company=12884][/company]. Players pursue ultimate combo actions for different categories (trading, production, science, civic, and military), but they also find the internal balance among these paths due to the limit of available building tokens as well as the prerequisite for Temple construction. Area control (not really that much of AREA CONTROL) provides some flavors of expanding your nation, and the military aspect is mainly focused on attacking Barbarian Villages rather than your fellow players, which reduces the aggressiveness of this game and welcomes more players who like "peaceful" games. The mechanic of discarding your hand cards to make offerings to God is my favorite design. This makes players ponder if they should play more buildings or keep more cards to maximize the God's favors. Really love it.
The rules are simple, the combinations of cards are dynamic, the expansion on the map is key to the card effects. Look forward to exploring more possibilities after the first play. It should be a very enjoyable medium strategy (maybe medium-light if familiar with the cards) game on our gaming table.

RATING: 5
Mostly solitaire tableau-building card combo game with a map that seems less relevant than it ought to be. There is some fun in the card combos, but there is a lot of luck in the card draw, so it's difficult to plan effectively. The cards you get in your tableau are draw-driven, not player-planned.  Worse yet, I won by a single point by employing the least interactive strategy of the group. Deus is neither attractive nor exciting and, like so many of these mostly solitaire tableau-builders, seems to play better with fewer players.  It's not bad, but I have trouble thinking of good reasons to replay it.

RATING: 6
Online play only.

Seems like a decent enough game, but subject to randomness of the card draws. Need to try it in real life, I suppose, but it just seems a bit too random to really enjoy the game repeatedly.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
The board is randomly configured, with barbarian villages and 5 other terrain hexes. Players each have a starting hand of 5 cards, and 2 of each building type.

On your turn, either play a card or discard cards. If playing, you'll be building that type of building on the board in a hex adjacent to another of your buildings (or pay 3VP to come in on a new edge). Place the card in it's matching column, and activate every other card there, in order of placement (last last). These cards may give you cards, resources, or VP, or allow you to move your soldiers on the board. If discarding, discard a card and any others you like (to increase effect): depending on color discarded, get a reward (similar to when building buildings) and refill your hand to 5 (+ more sometimes).

The game ends when all barbarian villages have been conquered (when completely surrounded by pieces) or all temples (number varies by player count) have been built. Get some end-game bonus VP (based on remaining money and resources); most VP wins!

This is a hand management, action selection, somewhat area control style game.  Players have a hand of cards with buildings on them.  These buildings can be played in one of two ways.  Either you can pay the depicted resource and monetary cost to place the building in your play area and a matching wooden token on the map then take the actions of all the buildings of that particular type.  Or you can discard any number of buildings as an offering to the gods.  The top building discarded denotes the god you are invoking and which power you get from collecting money or resources to drawing more cards.  The card you discard also represents what type of wooden piece you collect allowing you to build more buildings in the future.

I love games with this mechanic, the mechanic being making a player choose between how to play the cards he has.  Each card can be a building or an offering to the gods and on top of that the bonus you get from the gods is dependent on the top card you discard.  I found myself in several situations where I had a particular building I wanted to build but no wooden piece of that type and no other cards of that type to offer to the gods.  These situations cause interesting decisions and tactical reorganization of your plans.

The game is also wonderfully balanced across player counts due to the modular board setup.  Too often games that play up to larger player counts can feel too open with lower player counts due to players abilities to separate and keep to themselves.  This game manages to keep players in close proximity across all player counts and that adds to the tension as well as providing good interaction.

It's also nice that with such simple rules the game is really accessible while also providing a great deal of depth which is a good balance to accommodate players of all intensities.  Definitely a winner in my book.

A tableau engine-builder that pushes all the right buttons for me. I really enjoy digging through the deck and setting up those chains of action cards on the table. The limited number of times you can activate a particular stack adds some interest to the decision tree.

RATING: 6
Hand-management efficiency game where cards of five different types are either discarded for a matching benefit (e.g. discard 3 cards, including one production card, for n=3 resources) or played face up in the relevant column in that player's tableau. Playing cards in this way allows buildings to be placed on the map, activates a special power, and also reactivates all other cards in that column. The obvious benefit to concentrating on one colour is outweighed by the sixth type of card, the temple, placed for scoring; a second temple can only be played after one card of each other type.

The combination of cardplay and light spatial element is quite engaging, but the luck of the card draw is unusually frustrating. Good synergies can be surprisingly difficult to realize -- it is enormously irritating to cycle a large number of cards in search of a colour only to not find a single one.

Rating more likely to go down than up.

Game that for me hits the middle ground between 7 Wonders (building part) and Terra Mystica. As such, probably a game that will go down well with the BGG crowd.

I enjoyed playing it as there is a spatial map-element to it (a thing often lacking in Euro games) and it simply looks good. Box down to the components. Excellent rulebook too. The chaining of buildings is nice as it gives a sense of empire building. Top that off with a nice - albeit a bit generic - gameboard layout and some mild interaction and you have an interesting game.

My main beef with this game is the fact that although your actions key off each other, this is limited by the fact of the limited buildings you have at your disposal. So delve deep into a track and you'll run out of ways to activate it.

I get that otherwise you would get runaway leader syndrome, but the restriction feels very gamey. However, it plays fast and is enjoyable.

If you enjoy 7 Wonders and might enjoy Terra Mystica but find that a bit on the heavy side, definitely check this one out. Medium weight Euro. 

Recommended, just not for me.

When Deus came out I was intrigued by the theme and the board looked crazy. I didn't pull the trigger on acquiring it because of the usual flood of games coming out. Elysium came out around the same time and I couldn't decide which to get so I ended up not getting either. It's a tough first world problem, I know.

So recently I traded for Deus.

I'll keep this review short and just say that I really enjoy the game. There are some key things that I like about it:

- The rulebook is incredibly short. The game is very familiar to other games. It's a tableau builder and you cycle or play cards from your hand to get combos going. A little like Race for the Galaxy. It also has the crazy looking board in which you place lots of different wooden pieces down. This is similar to Concordia or Settlers. These end up being place markers for acquiring resources or points as the game goes on. This is mostly a card game. There is some tension with ending the games by sacking the barbarians but it's very slight.

- It has easy to understand combos. All the cards are very straight forward. In our first games we just figured out how to get some use of the cards and get buildings in the board, get some resources and surround the barbarian villages. Trying to make use of the temples seemed somewhat random. As you get to know the deck we discovered nice point making combos apart from temples and villages. Getting those little engines to work is fun. You may not get to use it more than once but it is fun trying. It's all about timing. Eventually we started to use the abilities to get you cards and buildings as well.

- It has a fast setup. I really don't mind getting this out for a quick game. The setup commits to memory easily and the little bits are nice.

- Offering to the gods is a good mechanic. This makes the game much more playable. You really have to cycle through and find cards that are useful. At first that was what we were doing and a lot of offering was happening. Now, cards in hand seem much more useful and the offering action is used more infrequently.

- There is a feeling of always progressing. As with most engine builders you have a sense of power developing. This game is interesting in that at some point that power will stop due to the restriction of building limits. This leads you to seek out other sources of the stuff you want. Trying new things is not detrimental and always gets you something.

- I really like exploring what I can do in this game. I haven't had a game end in misery for either player yet. The scoring feels right and the game play is fun. The randomness goes away after a few plays and you can just bury a temple that seems impossible to use. But, sometimes the board state makes you realize that you could just possibly make it work. There have been times where one of us got lost in the pace of the game and did not realize we screwed ourselves from utilizing that early temple we put down. 

If you like games where you roll with the punches, milk combos for what their worth and occasionally mess up the other opponent (but not too bad) then Deus might be what you are looking for. The theme is mostly irrelevant but the buildings do what they are supposed to do so it does have it in there. I'd say the theme is about as applicable as Castles of Burgundy. Maybe a touch more. But I like games that way. It doesn't burn your brain and is pleasing to play. There is an expansion on the way and I look forward to trying it out.

It's a fun one and I pull it out when I can. My wife seems to enjoy it and has not vetoed it when I suggest it. We do play that you can mulligan the first hand if you just feel it's a stinker. Just discard the unusable cards and redraw that many. It feels fair. Oh, and don't underestimate the usefulness of a pile of gold coins. It can get a lot done for you in this game.

A lot of game for a rather short playing time.  It suffers from what most card games suffer - too much random, or in the case of card games, draw the right cards first = win.  However, it offers a GREAT deal of mitigation for the randomness via tributes and cheap, easy card cycling.  It scratches some of the same itch as Imperial Settlers, but it does a better job, mainly because of the mechanics I described with manipulating cards in hand.

So far [person=38335][/person]'s output has been pretty good, so I was looking forward to this game. I was pleasantly surprised when this strategic came was finished in about an hour with 4 first timers yet it didn't feel too short or rushed or overdeveloped. In fact it felt like a full fledged strategy game. Good stuff!
The theme is pretty much pasted on and I feel like the graphic design is too clean for the theme they chose, but that's all nitpicking.
One thing that kind of annoyed me was that the temples are limited to those available. That means that if the game end is triggered, but you still get to perform a turn, you won't be able to build a temple even if you have the right cards and resources. And that will hurt your score. I feel like more temples should be available after the end of the game has been triggered.

I like it, but after so many plays it's gotten a little repetitive. Changing the geometry of the board doesn't seem to help much, especially since for balance's sake each tile consists of two water, a barbarian camp, and one of each land terrain. The real issue is I've become a bit tired of the deck. I'd be very interested in a small card expansion pack which reintroduces some variety. Say, 32 cards to be mixed in with the existing 96, then 32 cards are removed at the beginning of each game.

This game is really random. I had high hopes but it was such a disappointment. It's not as quick of a game as I've heard people claim. With the draws you have to be tactical but someone else can get draws that form a coherent strategy and you're just out of luck for that game. You might know how to counter that strategy but if you're not drawing any of those cards there's nothing to do about it

Fast turns, combo-licious, board where players bump into each other. Just love this game. Can't wait to get and try the expansion.

RATING: 8
A well-crafted design that seems to have me pursuing (with varying degrees of success) very different strategies from game to game. Which is a big part of the appeal here. I like that the board does have some race-to-the-spot and area-control elements, but getting boxed in or losing the battle for points at a barbarian village doesn't spell doom for your game, as building dense settlements has advantages, as well. I love some of the synergies you can create with card play, but also like that there are limits on cards of each type. The decision about whether to play/build a card or make a sacrifice for more cards or resources is always tough. Still don't know for sure what a consistently winning strategy would look like in Deus, but having fun trying to find out.

Civ Lite with a very simple ruleset that nevertheless forces tricky decisions upon you each and every round. It reminds me to quite some extent of Innovation, at least when played with the echo effects. And it's not that far off, really. When expanding your building columns you're building up combos which can be further enhanced by other building columns (more combos). Mixed with a little area control and a very neat system to replenish your deck of available building cards. Great!

Really like it so far. The luck of the draw can be an issue, but it seems like it ends up affecting all players fairly evenly. I do suggest using the variant in the back of the rules that let you play a card facedown once per game, because I had one game where I didn't draw a single blue card so I was limited on temples.

The combos are great and the basic gameplay is so simple it's almost at gateway level. Really good.

One of my favorite tableau builders. I love the mini-civ feel it gives me. I really like the way it blends the map with players' tableaus. At first glance, the map may seem like a tacked-on element, but it's not. It's important to stake your claim on certain land features. And there's a whole lot of fun ways to block and maneuver around your opponents--again, not easily apparent at first glance.

I highly recommend Deus. So far, it's the best medium-weight, quick-playing civ game I've found. And believe me, I've done a lot of searching for that very thing.

An interesting mix of Catan meets 7 Wonders. The game starts a little show and is a balancing act to keep everything running. It might be too easy to trip up your own engine, but it's fun learning how to balance everything. This game would be easier to bring in new players if the art design had gone in a different direction. With that being said, everyone I've introduced it to like it once they got over the weird design. Also, I would have appreciated a different color pallet than the green and brown. They are really close for my colorblind eyes.

Deus is a fairly straightforward game.  You have cards and you either pay the cost to build a card (and put that building on the game board) or make an offering to cards to a god for some special benefit.

Cards of the same type stack on each other and each new card of that type will retrigger previous cards you've played.

The challenge of this game is finding combinations that lead to points and managing the cards you're dealt, either making the best of what you've got, or offering cards away to draw better ones.

I really enjoy this game a lot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
In [thing=162082][/thing] the options for the players are pretty simple: either play a card and build something, or make an offering to the gods. Easy, right? The complexity is really in the different types/actions of the cards and the effects of the gods once you offer to them.

Each card is associated with one of the six gods, and the card is put in the row of that god. The player then pays the building costs present in the card to put the respective construction on the board, adjacent of another building he already has (or, if starting the game, entering in a point one tile away of someone else). The costs are materials - wood, stone, wheat and/or clay - and/or money. Then the effect of the card is activated (all cards have and immediate one, except the temples, which are only worth points by the game's end). Now, the big leap of the game is that, once you add a card to a row that already contain other card, you activate it/them also, going from the bottom card (the first you put in that row) to the top one (the one you just put it). This allows for some fine combos and some memorable turns. For instance, let's say in your Ceres column you already have three buildings, and their abilities are:

1st card - One of your production building produces 1 resource associated with its region;
2nd card - Earn two woods for each of your production building built in a forest; 
3rd card - Earn two stones for each of your production building built in a mountain.

Then you put another card in this column, and it has the ability to earn two clay for each of your production building built in a swamp. So the player activates the first card, and you get 1 wood. Then you have 1 production building in a forest, so you get 2 woods. Next you 2 stones for the 1 production building you have in a moutain. Finally, you take 2 clays, as the building you just put on the board is in a swamp area. So, after all is said and done, the player got 3 woods, 2 stones and 2 clays in a single play.

If the player don't want to build, he can make an offer to a god. There are six differents gods, each with an unique effect. To make an offering, the player selects one card on his hand - this will determine to which god the offering will be made - and put it on top. Then he decides how many more cards he will add to the offering - the more cards, the bigger will be the favor of the god. After receiving the favor of the god, the player ends his turn by filling up his hand of cards (usually 5, if the offer wasn't to Minerva). The favors of the gods are:
- Neptune: 2 money per offered card and 1 ship building;
- Ceres: 1 resource of any kind per offered card and 1 production building;
- Minerva: 1 more card drawn per offered card and 1 scientific building (so, for instance, if the player offered 3 cards, when drawing cards, he would drawn until he has 8 cards in hand);
- Vesta: 1 victory point per 1 card or 2 victory points for 2+ cards, and 1 civil building;
- Mars: 1 building of any kind (military - the type of Mars, ship, production, scientific and/or civil) per offered card;
- Jupiter: invokes the favor of any one of the other gods, with exactly the same effect as if the offering was beign made to it.

In order to build the player has to have a building of the type required, so, the offering for the gods mantain the flow of buildings in the game. I enjoyed this mechanic oh, so very much, as it allows someone to get rid of the unwanted cards in hand and, in doing this, also gaining some good benefit and replenishing the hand with new cards. This make the game dinamic, always going foward, as it will be unsual that players stay "stuck" for more than a couple of turns. Really well thought out mechanic.

Continuing in the good ideas, the chain reaction for the activation of cards, though not a novelty, make form some pretty hard decisions and some sweet turns. The simple act of using one card first or second makes a big difference in how useful they will be to you. For example, let's consider this situation in the Neptune column:

1st card: Buy up to three resources of your choice for 1 gold each;
2nd card: Sell stone for 4 gold each.

This order is, usually, better than the other way around. As you can use the first card to take, say, 2 stones and a wheat (for 3 money), then use the second to sell both the newly got stones (for 8 money), having, at the end, 1 wheat and 5 gold more than when you started. If the first card was the one that sells stones, you could have a situation with no stones to sell (and I said it would be worst this way as gold is, usually, easier to come by than some specific resource). There are also indirect associations, as some civic cards allow the activation of cards in other columns, or give points accordingly to the amount of cards of a type you already have in your tableau. This is all interesting and nice to see in action, when you or someone else do something awesome with a big domino effect.

The components are fine and the art, overall, is well done and efficient to convey the feeling of the setting. The board is made by some tiles of weird format that don't join together all that well, but I understand that this was made because of the amount of regions each has to contain, and this prevented the board from being made with hexagonal spaces and a more common format. At least it looks good enough on the table. An interesting caveat is that wood (the resource) is represented by brown tokens, but, in the cards, they are the green icons! And the gold, by the way, is made mostly of green tokens, but, in the cards, they are orange. Not something major, but definitely can be confusing at first, and both would be pretty easy to avoid, however, the owner of the game said to me that the design admitted the he is color blind, which may have something to do with it (but the fault is really on the publisher). Finally, my plays went without hiccups, with few consults to the manual.

Now, onto the heart of the game: points. On the board there will be tokens for the barbarian tribes. Each tribe are worth points accordingly to the number of regions around it, and to take these points the tribe must be fully surrounded. When this happen, and there is at least 1 military building around it, the player with the most buildings around the tribe take the points to himself. Besides these points, there are cards that give points, be by selling resources or simply by having a type of building. Temples are cards that are scored at the end of the game, and each has a different requirement for what will it give points for, like: 2 points for every 3 gold, 2 points per wheat, 4 points per temple you built, 4 points per swamp in which you have a building, and so on. All the temples are capped at 12 points for the amount of points each can give. The first temple can be made just by paying the required resources (1 of each). For the second, the player will have to have 1 card of each type in his tableu; for the third, he will need two of each type, and so on.

The triggers for the game to end are: either all the tribes were surrounded or all the temples have been built. When this happen, the current round will end and, then, everyone will have one more turn to play. After this, the game is over and is time to do some juicy scoring. Players tally their points accumulated during the game (tribe tokens plus points earned by cards plus  offerings to Vesta). Then will add up the points gained due to temples. Then, for each resource, including gold, the player with the most of each will gain 2 points per type of resource and for having the most gold.

And done! The player with the most points is the winner.

The time of a play can vary a lot, even with the same number of people. One three players game I had took us around 90 minutes - it was an easy going game, with everyone taking their time to build stuff, slowly expanding, and chaining some effects. Giggles of joy were involved. These were so true that both the triggers for the game end happened in the same round. We immediatly played a second one, and it was a total and unbashed run to the finish line. Two players rapidly expanded, building cheap and rushing to surround tribes. When the third player saw it was lagging behind, when the opportunity came, he ended the game by closing the circle around the last tribe. It took around 45 minutes. Same people, same game.

But, wait! [thing=162082][/thing] has its issues. One of them is inherent to card games: the luck of the draw. The mechanics act against this, a lot, but can still happen. In one game, a player saw his first temple card in the second to last turn! More in this matter, there seems that some cards are more useful than others - most of those that give benefits for several buildings in one space were ignored, specially in the early game, as it appeared to us that expanding is a better way to go than building in the same spot. Some variants, from what I can tell, make the board tighter and, naturally, better for a strategy involving multiple buildings in the same spot (as it isn't allowed to build where someone else already did); but, in the normal game, we found those cards too weak to make an effort for them.

Another issue (that might not be an issue to several players) is the individuality of the gameplay. [thing=162082][/thing] is, mostly, a multi-player solitaire. You do your thing, I do mine, and we meet in the end to compare our stacks of points. Though the [thing=162082][/thing] has some similarities to a civilization game (expansion, several types of buildings, military presence), this didn't translates into confrontational actions inside the play: there is no commerce between players, no war or conflicts, nor it is possible to take someone else's regions and/or buildings, or destroy these. This reinforces the strength of expanding to the maximum one can, as this gives more opportunities to expand further and the amount of cards the player can benefit from, without any drawback, like beign spread too thin and assume the risk to lose regions and buildings. The closest thing to being attacked is some military actions (the Mars cards) that steal points or money from neighbours - but these are mostly weak and don't happen all that often. But mostly the "in your face" will be taking the spot someone wants. There are those that want a high interaction game, and those that prefer the more lenient and solitaire ones, and [thing=162082][/thing] is best fit for the latter people.

So [thing=162082][/thing] is, without a doubt, an indisputable euro with low interaction, staying way behind [thing=166857][/thing] and [thing=42][/thing] in this matter, and above [thing=107529][/thing]. For complexity is around the middle weight (3.0), with its high number of unique effect cards, the links between them, the chain activation and the several powers of the gods. The fun in [thing=162082][/thing] is in making combos and rejoicing in having huge turns with big results, seeing everything falling properly. Though it has a medium complexity, learning and playing was easy, but all in the table were experienced gamers, veterans of hundreds of [-]battl[/-]games, and this might have something to do with it.

Overall, [thing=162082][/thing] is fun do play, which, for me, is the most important feature in a game, however, the degree of luck (not all that high, but still very present) and the low interaction, might make it an unwise choice for many. Be aware of this, and of wrath of the gods.

I wanted this game if only to use the components as a kit, and because I liked the sound of players racing to surround barbarian hexes to score points. I thought I might hate the actual game due to the cards with special abilities written on them, and the invitation to develop reusable combos.

As it turns out, this game exceeded my expectations. The card system is not overly convoluted or crazy. The board play is satisfying and feels about as hoped. It doesn't really come across as a point salad. There's also an interesting sensibility to the design of the players' turns, that other games could learn from.

Specifically, on your turn you get to do exactly one thing, but it is no micro-move. There are fundamentally only two things you can do on your turn: Place a new building/unit on the map, or discard cards for new ones. All the other things you need to do in the game (use your tableau abilities, get new buildings out of supply and ready to build, convert useless cards into more useful resources) get done in the process of executing one of the two options. It is not initially intuitive which actions are married to which, but the end result is that tons of tasks get accomplished without the player needing to specifically think about each one.

My opponent and I (both of us liking the game) agreed that we didn't like the dynamic of certain abilities allowing armies to whittle down barbarian hexes, causing the players to not need to fully surround the hex. We raced to get armies out and didn't care that much about other types of units. I don't inherently have a problem with that (even though it was to the point that I barely even remember what the central gimmick of two of the six card types were), except that it meant that the red cards were crucial to draw (in order to place and use your armies), and it's up to luck whether your draws would include those cards.

I want to say: It's also theoretically possible to score points and initiate the end of the game by building temples. I don't think the game really supports this strategy (too hard to build multiple temples), but even if it did/does, I would still not want to see people winning the game without focusing on surrounding barbarian hexes. I like the game's focus. So I feel that if the game is flawed it's in the amount of luck, not in an imbalance of the strategies.

Additional issue: It's a little displeasing that the game supports building production buildings to make resources for you, but it's really much easier to get a production card and use it to convert discards into resources.

Misplayed: I did not understand the rules as saying that buildings of different players could [i]never[/i] coexist in a region (even with buildings of different types). Played correctly blocking would be more feasible; perhaps I'd like that even better.

At first glance I thought this was a 7 Wonders rip-off but then after watching The Dice Tower review I realised it was quite different; I think it feels like a cross between Bruges (where one card can be used for many actions) and Troyes (where you can activate a power multiple times, but with out the dice!). 

Pros:

- game scales well for additional players
- turns are quite quick as you only ever have two possible actions
- rules are straight-forward and easy to teach
- many different paths to victory

Cons:

- artwork is alright but a bit dull
- the wood counters are green in the instruction manual but physically brown

Overall a very enjoyable game.

Played 2-player game twice. Not sure I want to play with more than two especially folks with AP issues or newbies. There is significant downtime with all the card text and this will certainly drag with 4 players. That is too bad because the game with two doesn't have a ton of interactions. This is essentially a card driven game with a modular board to promote interaction between players via the red military card. The engine building and the occasional take that interaction reminded my wife of Machi Koro where the red cards allow players to steal money/VP from other players. Certainly this sounds like a stretch but there are several similarities including the engine building mechanism.

In the end, I am not wholly convinced this game deserves the hype or accolades. It is an ok game where if you draw the right cards, your card combinations will flow smoothly and you will have an easy time getting the engine to hum. The flip side is, if you don't get the right cards or the timing is wrong, then the engine will sputter.

Reminds me in many ways of Ginkgopolis, in that it's a tableau builder with a board where bonuses are stacked, making your actions that interact with the board better over the course of the game. However, Deus feels like a much more average game, with its generic euro theme and its familiar "acquire things and then turn them into victory points" course. 

Good but not great.

There is a big potential for downtime. It's a heavy card-churn game (like Race For The Galaxy), so you're definitely at a huge disadvantage on your first play against anyone who has seen the various cards in action (meaning there's a lot to grok just to bring everyone up to a non-random baseline, like Innovation).

All that being said, I enjoyed the game for the most part, and liked it more than Race or Innovation.

Solid Civ-game with very interesting card play with combos, card/resource management and a bit of area control/area fighting

[+] nice look on the table, love the card play & creating combos, easy to redraw your hand when you get bad cards
[-] a bit slow to start, and then kind of over too fast; don't like the map/area/barbarian mechanic, it seems to be there just to provide some interactions; would have liked some asymetric powers "right from the start"

UP: after more plays I find the 4p game lacking near the end. Sometimes you get to a point where you can't complete a barabarian village and there are no more cards to draw, everyone is stuck waiting either for temple, either for a color to unlock another temple, etc, but everytime you discard you redraw your own cards... the game realy needs more cards (I've played complete 4p game where one player does not get any card from 1 color!)

Lots of neat cards in the deck that I look forward to having in my hand at some point.    There is some luck of the draw (it IS a card game), but I think this would really shine in a 45-75 minute game time.   Hope to get there.

Awarded '9' after ten plays. I love this game with two players. It feels like a light civilisation game with card combinations. You're conquering territories by placing pieces and playing cards to trigger combos.

It reminds me of Samurai, 7 Wonders, Bruges, Innovation, Small World, San Juan... Many excellent medium-light games.

Ignore anyone who says that Deus has limited player interaction. There's no direct combat (you can't throw someone off a territory), but - boy - can you mess with someone's plans. You can plant your troops next door and steal their money. You can fight like ferrets in a sack to surround a barbarian village and take the VPs before the other player. You can block people off, stopping them accessing the territories they need to generate valuable resources.

The decisions are agonising. You can't draw new cards unless you turn in your existing hand... You can't gain new pieces to place unless you turn in your existing hand or trigger the right card combinations. It is simply brilliant.

As far as engine-building games go, Deus certainly... exists. While it executes the concept of engine-building pretty well, it takes quite a while to a decent point. In addition, the early game is stuffed with card scrapping mechanics that kills most strategies until the mid-game. Fun, but other games are worth the time more.

Wow, What a great game. Engine building done right. I thought the theme is excellent even though not really prevalent. The area control and board set up is a great mechanic. So many ways to score points. The card combos felt fresh and fun to explore. The rules were easy once we learned them. Defiantly a keeper in my collection.

Enjoyed more the second time around.  A lightish, quick euro game with a nice interesting engine to build. 
Surprised at how simple/quick it played Vs. how deep the gameplay can be.

This feels like Terra Mystica the card game and that's only partly because of the wooden buildings and terrain hexes. Most turns consist of nothing more than playing a card and placing the appropriate building on the map. Simple as that, players race to grab territory and cut each other off from important resources. If it stopped there, the game would be pretty lame. Fortunately, each new building played has a unique effect that triggers when you build it. In a bigger twist, each time you construct a new building all of the old buildings of the same type fire off their effect again.

The result is an injection of TCG style combos and action chains that inject a ton of opportunities for clever play, but not so many that players get bogged down in options. My favorite release of 2014, by far.

RATING: 6.5
This is an interesting engine building game with cards. While the game feels fine and has obviously been well thought through, it looses points due to the poor graphic and production quality which tends to confuse players. Also, despite having to choose from just two actions per turn, the game can suffer from analysis-paralysis late in a four player game. Player interaction is also minimal.

Vroenis Vector Award nominee. 
Vroenis Masters Award 3rd runner-up. 

Early exclamations of unbalanced combos are unfounded. This is a game for masters that thankfully doesn't come with an excess of overhead. Even in the first play, players will cycle through the entire deck of cards at least once and see a fair amount of them. This is a game of knowing what potential combos are, and balancing timing and resources on a knife-edge. It should be played aggressively and not conservatively - military should be used for mobility and blocking, and there are active counter-strategies to some of the more powerful long-term VP engines.

This is in my top 20 and in time, may crack my top 10 for its cleverness and hidden depth and cunning. Stay awake, take note of others' movements, attempt to anticipate them and don't waste time milling - if others are doing so, pivot to short-term sub-optimal moves to shift strategy (having become familiar with the cards) and be ready to pursue what others aren't. Your job is to get on your timeline and when necessary, shift timelines before everyone else, and when you can't, get in their face and block aggressively. The spatial element cannot be ignored! This is almost the perfect dream of a Euro-engine driven war game! (OK that's a huge stretch - nevertheless! Play aggressively!)

What I love- the ability to use offerings-'discards' to draw cards and find what works best for the engine you are trying to build. The best tableau builder I have played. Is replacing Race for the Galaxy and San Juan for me; mainly because it feels like I have a lot more control over the luck factor than in those games. The luck factor is about as low as you can get in a card based game, once you know what you are trying to do. Great feeling of getting a lot done and actually improving as game goes on. Quick turns except maybe last few super-turns that you can build. Amazing and fun! Skill is definitely rewarded.
edit- Needs an expansion

What I dislike- while you can steal small amounts of money and victory points from your opponents, and you could also mildly block of portions of the map; I wish I could push players out of certain spaces on the board. Currently, in it's un-expanded form, once a player claims a territory, its theirs and only theirs for the rest of the game.

I don't see the appeal of this one.  The epitome of multiplayer solitaire made worse by incredibly ugly components.

RATING: 8
Nice game. Except that my group didnt really like it and pretty solitaire. 

Pros

Easy to teach

1 hour + game [except 1 game where a player was constantly on his phone and another one had horrible AP]


Cons
Luck of the draw can really hurt.. Shuffle the cards well after every play or you'd get all the colours stacked together

People usually drone on and on "i activate this cards, take 1 x, now my this card trigger and i will take 1 y, now this card triggers i choose this area w 2 buildings so i take 2 z".


Sold it off to someone who would get more plays off it.

I've only played this online and only the one time. I enjoyed my play, but not enough to rush out and pre-order it. It'll be one of those games that I'll add to my want-=in-trade list and won't turn down, but might prefer something else.

I liked the card play and how you could play a card or discard cards to get benefits. You always have something to do on your turn and other people can affect that you're going to do. That being said, I felt like interaction was very limited and overall the game felt procedural.

Love this game.  When you get that engine going, and it keeps going, and going.  Why would you ever play imperial settlers when this exists.  Sure it has better art..  but the gameplay actually matters in Deus, its not just veiled mechanisms.  Well not completely just veiled mechanisms...  er... um..

Light to medium strategy card driven civ builder on a modular board of seven-terrain-circled hex tiles. Good thinky decisions on best use of cards for buildings, discard for resources or sacrifice to the Gods for certain special powers. Has a fair amount of interactive play through military. Area control around barbarian villages until the last is one is claimed or all the Temples have been built.

This game has a broken mechanic- if you don't get and play green cards in your hand (the ones that help get resources), you are pretty much screwed. 

And if its the first time playing the game, and it takes you several turns to get a feel for what is going on, if you haven't collected green cards by that point, your opponents will have, and you will still be royally screwed. 

To me, this causes a dominant strategy to exist, and makes the game less fun.

Card abilities are unbalanced and what cards you got is all about luck. There is no reason you have to place more than one buildings in single region because it is obviously not worth to do that.

Hook: A map based resource generating game, with a unique strategic build of serial actions (combo).

Fingerprint: Competitive. Buildup.
Players interaction - low to moderate. Only though map conquest.
Strategy - Very good. Allows some mid game shifts.
Replayability - several times. Random map (but map has only a small effect on strategy).
Luck - little.

Problems:
1. Small. A player can block one of two end game conditions.

Deus is a brilliant game. I've played it only with 2 players. Lot of thinking to play this one, the spatial element brought by the board brings a lot of diversity to the game and make the timing of your actions more important than the combos themselves. At first you need to get used to the game mechanics, combos and cards, but soon enough the spatial element becomes very important. You'll often have to choose between waiting for the right card or building a second rate building (I mean in for you combo) to preempt on an hex that your opponent would have taken. And more often than not, if you don't go fast enough you'll end blocked on a tiny part of the board. So I'll say timing and space management are the core of this game. Really enjoyable, fresh (the rules are short but very precise), I love this game, just can't wait for the expansion!

This is a pretty good Euro if you like creating card combos and action chains.  The board isn't quite superfluous but the interesting part is definitely what you are doing with your cards which left the game feeling pretty solitaire most of the time... which is weird for a game with an area enclosure element.  We did get stuck at one point where we couldn't end the game because the people who could enclose the last village just couldn't draw a boat despite cycling their cards a lot... so luck of the draw will be a big factor in this one at times.  All in all its something I'd be happy to play again but certainly don't need to own it.

Simple, clean mechanics with plenty of brain burning caused by when to play the Temple cards. The card play, tableau-building and board all integrate so well. My only complaint is the ugly graphic design on the board and chits. I'm looking forward to experimenting with other board layouts.

Erősen kezdett, egy apró probléma, h rengeteg jó kombó és lehetőség, ehhez képest ritkán kerül ránk a sor 4 fős játékban. Ettől függetlenül pörgős és ötletes, nagyon jól összerakták. Szívesen játszanék majd még vele. Persze nem kerül ránk ritkán, csak jó a játék és szeretnék még kombózni. :)

Ketten is volt alkalmam játszani vele, továbbra is teljesen rendben van, jól meg is veszem.

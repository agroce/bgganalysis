RATING: 8
Playing three player, after the first hand I thought meh, this is pretty random.  But as we played subsequent hands the game grew on me, and I began to appreciate the clever ploys that had started to become apparent.

There are some neat customizing moves you can pull off, and all of the modified cards will come round again in the next hand, possibly to be further modified.

The game reminded me a bit of Abluxxen, which I like a lot.

After one complete game I bought my own copy as I think many card-playing friends will like this interesting take on trick-taking-style play.

Another reimagining of a game in the public domain, President, (best known reimplemented  as The Great Dalmuti). This version lets the players upgrade or downgrade cards because the cards are sleeved. The manga style art work on the cards is impressive.

First Impressions:
Custom Heroes takes a fairly standard trick-taking/climbing game and adds AEG's "card crafting" system to it.  The ability to change cards over the course of the game is pretty neat.  Especially since the cards don't necessarily stay in your posession from round to round.  It makes the game unpredictable, and your strategies have to evolve a little as the card powers change.

The downside is that the physical manipulations of the cards (sliding the upgrades into card-sleeves) is so clunky and time consuming.  It runs counter the what should be a quick playing card game.  

Ultimately it's distracting enough to keep me from wanting to bring it out, especially when there are so many other good card games out there.  The novelty of the card-crafting doesn't make up for the short comings that come with it.

The game isn't very interesting with two players. All-too-often you can look at your hand and know how it is going to play out, as long as you have an idea what power cards are out there. I suspect it will be a lot of fun with more players.

Interesting use of the "Card Crafting System", but wonder if it causes just too much chaos for a climbing game.  The scoring is a little odd, but the 6 round cap makes it work just enough that it doesn't get in the way.  Not sure if this is a keeper, but its definitely different.

Custom Heroes is the latest game to use the card crafting system. The game starts out as a fairly standard trick taking game, but as the game progresses and cards are crafted it gets a little bit crazy. In this game your not only changing cards to effect them on that turn, but those changes stick around for the remainder of the game. Would probably have rated this highly but the game really does get a little to crazy in later rounds.

RATING: 8
This has gotten some lukewarm reviews in my circles, but I really enjoyed it. It’s got that bonkers, over-the-top feel we get from a certain sector of the Japanese game market, but tempered with a little American willingness to add a few rules if it makes the game play better or adds flavor (Japanese minimalism sometimes annoys me when it eschews obviously needed rules  in favor of the absolutely minimal footprint). As a result, it’s got a few little fiddly bits in there to make the game work, but we get a really fun, totally bananas, but still somewhat strategic and tactical climbing game. I love how the overlays thwart card-counting (I think) and make what seems like maybe a game that doesn’t have a lot too it into something rather interesting.

Anyway, glad I took a chance on this and have enjoyed it. It also encrouraged me to go back to Mystic Vale (which got a lot better with the 2nd expansion) and keep my eyes open for AEG’s upcoming games using this idea.

A trick taking game combined with the whole card-crafting idea from games like Mystic Vale though the anime theme does nothing for me. While this trick taking game has no runs you simply play sets of numbers, but then you have transparent cards that you can sleeve into the cards to modify them further. There is a small economy to activate card powers or if you don't activate them when played they earn you money. Once you go out you earn points, money, and/or card powers for the next round. We played with a variant of 12 points and then 1 more round to end the game, because the idea of a person over 10 points then having to go out first in the next round in order to win made it seem like the game could go on forever. Even playing to 12 the game felt like it went on a round or two too long since it was obvious in our 5 player game that only 2 people were competing in the last two rounds to determine a winner.

The gimmick isn't enough to save this horribly subpar Dalmuti-inspired mess. No strategy (your cards are never really yours) and the upgrade mechanic feels like it was slapped on (when do you upgrade your cards? Whenever, I guess). I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'd rather play Gloom.

So ladder-climbing, like Tichu, but no teams, all competitive, and a lot less play options for the tricks. Card-crafting to edit cards during the round and change them, get abilities, make bets even. So fantastic. And I like the art even though it is random and there's no theme or reason for it; but it does have cute things like putting foam fingers on the fighters to subtract from their value, or give them weapons to increase their value. I am not enamoured by Tichu despite loving trick-taking team games like Spades and Euchre. But I really enjoyed this, would always prefer this to Tichu despite my love of team games. And yeah, I bought this after 1 play.

A ladder-climbing card-shedding game very similar to The Great Dalmuti but with customizable card-building via sleeves like Mystic Vale.  More gimmick than game, but it does have the best use of the Skip mechanic since Uno.   While the art was okay, the execution of the overlays and sleeves could have been better.   The cards are very dark and muted when overlaid.    There isn't a lot of control, which makes this a social game.

"Well, at least it's better than Mystic Vale", isn't something a game should be aiming for. I blame the publisher. And the designer.

(It's also a better use of the gimmick than Mystic Vale, but that, too, is an incredibly low bar.)

Ultimately, the whole must-peel-the-cards, combined with the ongoing hassle of putting cards in sleeves in mid-turn, then un-sleeving them at the end of the game puts a pretty strong onus on the game to be worth the trouble. Sadly, probably predictably, nothing has come close to meeting that burden. This gimmick is probably something that belongs in an electronic game, not a physical one.

I cannot say enough about this game. It is very easy to learn and teach. Plays up to six players and I can say it has been more fun with 6. The game flows relatively quick so there is very little down time between turns. It is a great gateway game and would suggest sharing this before Mystic Vale. I also can see the opportunities for expansions with this one as well. If you haven't tried this one you should and add it to your collection.

Interesting concept with the use of card customization as part of the main mechanics of the game. However, I thought this to be a little clunky and gimmicky. If you take the customization away you have a very standard trick taking game with no great shakes. The theme had absolutely nothing to do with the mechanics or game play. This is just an ok trick taker in my opinion.

Components: cards, sleeves and modifications are good
Complex: easy to learn and play
Weight: light
Players: 4 or 5
Length: less than 60 mins
Mechanics: trick tracking, create cards
Decisions: enough for a trick tracking, what to play and what to modify
Opinion: really funny trick tracking game, lets say that this is a game where you have to rid off of your cards, so far nothing new. The idea on this one is that cards can be modified, you have several powers, and you will gain more, that can be attached to each card modifying them (lets say that with cards from 1 to 10 you can make a pair of 12's with just one card).
The funny part is that there are 10 cards per player in play, one set from 1 to 10 the first round. You deal 10 cards to each player, do whatever you do in the round (play card and rid off your cards), but, once the round ends... all card are shuffle together again, and dealt in the new round...therefore, that powerful card you created the previous round, could be on another player hands...
Found it a really funny trick tracking game, much better than many out there. And the sleeve action is easy and good quality

2018-02-24 - I like trick taking and ladder climbing games, and this one is not my favorite. That said, it's a pretty fun twist on the genre. The card building can be great when you have just the right enhancement for your situation, and it feels good to take people by surprise. That said, those enhancements also make it virtually impossible to keep track of what's going on, so the strategy is severely limited.

Repeat plays have this one going up to a 7. Enjoy the crafting aspect along with the shedding/ladder aspects of the game. Not much of a fan of the artwork where some of the female characters' are busting out literally even though I know that is part of anime. I can deal with it, but it does somewhat limit to whom I will introduce the game. 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I want to like this but I'm not convinced I like the scoring structure. I suppose the game is built to be over fairly quickly, but it seems like in a three player game first place shouldn't be worth halfway to winning the game. I suppose that could be customizable to fit what you want as far as length of game play. The customizing in this ladder/card shedding game is interesting although I'm not sold on some of its quirks (IE, being able to play the exact same card(s) as the player before you to skip the next player, superpower cards which allow you to play top card by itself no matter what is being played even if it is four of a kind). Definitely wanting to give it a few more plays. 

Cards feel flimsy but since they have to be sleeved, probably not a big deal. Feels like cards from a typical Japanese card game production level.

RATING: 8
Well done trick-taking game with a twist. The card-crafting makes for some interesting plays, with the opportunity to do things like reverse the direction of which card you need to play next, skip other players by playing the same number, and making a single card played into a pair, etc. Very clever, yet easy to teach and learn. This plays better at higher player counts. I'd suggest a minimum of 4, and it's really fun at the full 6 player count since the hands last longer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A competent trick taker. I think there is a bigger learning curve than expected. Players make ridiculous cards, which inevitably get redistributed and cause a bit of chaos. I think experience will temper those tendencies and improve the experience past the current competent level.

There's potential for greatness, or failure, to come.

Completely luck based, not really fun, idiotic victory condition (you need to win the turn to win the game) that can theoretically extend the game time to infinity, annoying theme (subjective, but I don't like it)...

First impression, after one 5p game.  I like climbing games (Tichu is one of my all time favorites), so I liked the basic mechanics in this game.  However, the addition of card exceptions and mutations ( the main gimmick of this game) and the additional layer of complexity and fiddliness in both the scoring and the play are an unpleasant addition.  I also don't care for the art and design style.  I would rather play a more elegant, traditional card game and have no desire to play this one again.

This is so much fun! A ladder climbing game combining the card crafting from mystic vale. Superb design, easy to teach and ridiculously fun with some of the cards that get powered up tremendously over the rounds. I don't get why some people get offended by the anime art as I think my 7-year old son won't be offended I guess. This is a really fun game that needs more attention imo. With 3 players it seems to be over too soon though with only 2 or 3 rounds played but who cares, just play another game. I really like this game and it should get some more buzz imo.

Utilizes the same card-crafting mechanism seen in Mystic Vale, but not to as great an effect. Custom Heroes is a pretty run-of-the-mill trick-taking game, though it feels halfway between a trick-taking game and a ladder climbing game since you play around the table until all but one person passes and you can play sets of the same number. The card-crafting is kind of a gimmick, if anything, that gets handed out to the players based on when they emptied their hand in a previous round. I do like that cards you craft can end up being used by other players from round to round, but I also feel like the game doesn't go on long enough to see the game evolve and change like I would want it to.

In the sea of creative trick-taking games coming out these days, Custom Heroes feels like a bit of a disappointment. It's a solid game, no doubt, but the card crafting isn't as impactful as it was in Mystic Vale. There it felt like you were building an engine to score points. Here it feels like you're messing with the number values of the cards, or turning singular cards into trumps, or other usual trick-taking tropes. It all works well enough, but I wish that the card-crafting was featured more, and was more of a game-changer when applied to the various cards.

A perfect game, IMO. A very different trick-taking ladder-climbing card game that is right up my alley. This is Dilbert: Corporate Shuffle on steroids, but with a better scoring system and winning conditions, much replayability due to the card crafting system, and very good 2-player rules. Bravo AEG and John D. Clair. This is a game I didn't realize that I've been searching for for a few decades.

The graphic design and artwork really makes an already cool design cooler.

Pro: Fun little game. Plays quick and the various upgrades lead to different sets of cards by game end.

Con: On opening the box, several power cards already had the thin plastic layer coming off.  When a friend tried to shuffle them, the plastic pulled off further, making 4 of them unusable (unless we pull the layer completely off.) Fortunately there are plenty of power cards, so it won't impact game play.

Our first play of this was incorrect and because of it, it felt rather swingy, chaotic and far too long. After actually reading the rules and fixing the mistakes, it plays out in roughly the quoted time and didn't feel quite as swingy. It's still a bit chaotic, but I felt far more control when we were spending energy tokens to activate a card and not to craft it. Only going 6 rounds with a potential for a 7th made it also a much shorter game. We also fixed an error where you play a card with an activation cost, you get an energy back if you don't use the power.

I liked the ambitious nature of the game, but I'm not sure I'd want to play this over the multitude of other trick taking games as it just felt a touch too long for what I got out of it.

Surprisingly 2 players was fun as you couldn't "skip" a player and still had plenty of stuff to mull over.

RATING: 6
This takes the basic skeleton of a climbing game and adds heaps of crazy to it. It strikes me as longer and more complicated than the level of crazy justifies. The victory condition means that there isn't much for you to do if you aren't within reach of winning, so if you get a bad hand you are just along for the ride. I also worry that the optimal strategy is to save all of your power-up card inserts for when you have a shot at winning; but the inserts are what make later rounds crazy and fun; so the fun of the game requires some players to play non-optimally.

Okay, I played a lot of spades back in the day, I mean a lottttt, way before I knew there was even a boardgame scene. I really care nothing about having trick taking games with theme. I played Tournament at Camelot and absolutely hated it. I can honestly say, I went into this game, wanting to hate it, but I had a blast. Am I saying it's great, not necessarily, even though I would need more plays to see if it was just a fluke experience. But that being said, I really enjoyed it. There are some concerns for me in some of the mechanics, but I am often scared to judge stuff like that until I have had substantial plays. That being said, there is no theme to this game even though they have pasted something on. The art is pretty to look at while you play, that's about it. Worth a play if you like trick taking games and have the chance. I'm not an expert in what a good trick taking game is because I avoid them. But I am a gamer, and I try to be as objective as possible.

RATING: 4
A unique card-shedding game with appeal that largely lies in its gimmicks. Par for the course, your higher-valued cards trump opponents' lower-valued cards. The twist is that the game allows you to augment your cards with plastic overlays. These overlays usually modify the base value of a card, or provide special abilities that bend the rules of the game. Sometimes both. I found it interesting that you could actually use subtraction of your card values to let you shed more cards in a turn.

It bemused me to witness several players in my game become so concerned with how they could have played a trick "better". In truth, during each trick, there is an absurd amount of randomness injected into the game, coupled with what is possibly the most non-sensical mechanism: the means to cause the person on your left to lose their entire turn to play, and sometimes losing multiple turns in a row. This works in UNO because it matches the tone of UNO. I would much rather play UNO than this game, and I don't care much for UNO to begin with. But, in Custom Heroes, when you are meticulously "crafting" a set of cards for a "strategic" power-play, only to have your turn skipped, and your play robbed from you, well--it simply isn't very fun, is it? UNO ends in 10 minutes or less. This game overstays its welcome for far longer than that.

Overall, the game felt unremarkable and at times very swingy. The augmentations persist throughout the game, causing wilder, more broken cards to cycle through players' hands. Whether or not you are dealt one or more of these supercards is a complete crapshoot, and therein lies the rub. Take your win, or loss, in a game of Custom Heroes with a grain of salt, but if you seek a more skill-based trick-taking game, look elsewhere. 

(+) Simple, familiar trick-taking at its core.
(+) Customizing cards is a novel feature, and using each modifier in a clever manner is a nice puzzle in itself.
(+) Colorful artwork, design choices notwithstanding. 

(-) Lacks depth. Part-way through the game the rounds became "samey" and soon enough the game felt like it overstayed its welcome. 
(-) Jarring periods of downtime as players are not only thinking of what to play (modifiers and effects to be considered) but also when they are fiddling with inserting modifier cards.
(-) Card modifying is a gimmick, at best, and combinations can be very swingy. These modifiers may as well be tokens or printed on additional cards to be included in the trick.

An interesting take on a climbing card game.  The upgrade/downgrade cards are fine, but the trump card just seems too silly.   Would be better without it.

Refreshing take on a classic style card game. Lots of interesting choices in a very accessable game. One of the few non-party games that I can bring out with gamers and non-gamers alike. I would also like to stress that this is not a trick taking game.

A fun twist on Presidents and Assholes but with an actual finish. Sliding customizations into card sleeves is fun and slamming down a heavy card is a tactile delight. Also, being able to come up with a creative solution to win a trick is very satisfying.

Perhaps it was just my group, but the game seemed to maybe last a little long and while the modifications are cool, they can be a little fiddly.

All in all a solid game, but I consider the complexity drinking game level. And I don't particularly want to drink while playing this game as it could ruin the components. Fun for what it is, but I personally don't see the niche time to play it often!

I really enjoy this game. It takes the cool ladder-climbing mechanic and flips it on its head by introducing card-crafting. The result is a lot of fun. It's a tad chaotic as all the cards get shuffled together each round, creating swings, but it's short enough that it's just fun, and not frustrating. Very good game.

Great game, plays best with 4, 5 if everyone has played.
6 player is super fun...for about 3 or 4 rounds....if the game goes the full 7 rounds @ 6 player, it's just too long. I recommend going 5 rounds with the 5th being the "tournament" round when playing with 6 players.

I liked this game a lot more than I thought I would. Like similar ladder/trick games it can be frustrating to get a bad hand.  However, the modifiers can minimize this quite a bit.

Big 2 with special powers. The special powers sounds fun but after several rounds the game becomes way too random so there is no strategies behind it. I would just prefer to play Big 2. And the game is NOT big in Japan.

Fun light game. Is a bit of a pain to setup but once you're past that it plays fast. Inserts and the fact that you shuffle all the cards together and redeal every round add a nice element of randomness to an otherwise simple game. Art is very anime which is my only con but I can overlook it for a fun time overall.

Good version of president. Love the evolving card play that gives you some control over the game instead of always having to rely on luck of the draw. Not a huge fan of trick taking games overall, so my lowish score is based entirely on personal preference, but I do enjoy teaching it to other people even if I don't play myself.

If Mystic Vale and the Trou-d'cul (President card game) had a love child, that'd be Custom Heroes. Simple, accessible and great artwork.

This is asshole with special powers and card building.  If you aren't familiar with the drinking game asshole, the rules are basically that a person starts a round by playing a set of cards of a given number.  With a basic deck of cards that means you can start by playing 1 card to four of a kind.  The next person in turn order has to match or exceed the value on those cards but must play the same count of cards.  So a person playing 3 5s could be followed by three of any card from 5-Ace.  When a hand goes all the way around back to a player without a play they collect that hand and get to lead the next one.

This game is played like that and the winner is the first one to gather 10 gems which are collected (or lost) after each round based on the position you finished.  The gimmick to this though is you also collect money and power cards after each hand as well.  These slide into the sleeves of your standard cards and alter them in many ways.  They can replace the number, add or subtract from the number, or grant powers like reverse the order from ascending to descending or count as two copies of that card.  Adding these cards cost money and they stay on the card for the whole game (there are 4 different types and each card can have up to one of each type).  Playing them later will cost the same amount of money or they revert back to their base ability.

It's kind of neat, I don't know that the game system of asshole is particularly good and the added layer here is entertaining enough.  It just seems pretty arbitrary and random to me.  There is strategy on card play order and when to activate certain abilities or add powers to specific cards.  But I'd say that layer is 20% and the other 80% is complete luck of the draw.

Don't play it at 2! More than 2 was good though. By the fourth round or so the cards were just getting crazy.

Note: This is climbing/shedding, NOT trick taking! Very fun take on the genre. Its light though; you can't be sure of anything as people customize their cards. Works well, plays fast even with 6.

Escalator card game similar to Career Poker. But the clever bit is that you can overlay your cards with transparent upgrades. Beautifully done but wrong game to be carrying the idea.

I'm a big fan of trick-taking/ladder-climbing games and I'm a big fan of Mystic Vale, so this game seemed perfect.

There is a weird dichotomy to the game, though. You can have some long turns as players think through the best way to use their advancements (the clear card upgrades), but the game also ends up feeling more chaotic than other trick-taking games because of the advancements.

The end-game is also a little weird. You have to already have ten points, and then you have to be the first one to shed all of your cards in a round. I would almost rather just play until a flat amount of points has been reached.

I like that the game has a unique feel as the deck evolves. The first round is almost a bare-bones ladder-climbing experience. But by the second round and onward, the deck of cards has changed drastically because of the advancements.

The catch-up mechanic of getting more advancements if you come in last place in a round works really well and keeps everyone in the game until the end.

Overall I've been liking the game. It's not my favorite of the genre, but for now it's a keeper.

Works great for decently sized groups, especially in the 3rd round or so and after, when the cards get so many enhancers in them! So satisfying to play a set of 5 of a kind! Not so great with 2 people :/ not enough enhancers going around, and you know what the other person has if you've been paying attention. Actually takes more like 1.5 hours with 5 people for a first game, or 1 hour once you've gotten up to pace.

Feels like a step up from Uno. It's card crafting like Mystic Vale but you play cards that others will probably end up using against you eventually. The Japanese art is good but the theme is pretty much non-existent. They say it's trick taking but other than being able to play first after taking a trick, there is no benefit to it. The rulebook is pretty bad as there are somethings not even touched on like the pluses and minuses on some of the advanced cards. We had a lot of small questions throughout that the rules either were vague about or did not even touch on. The gambling card is a nice touch as is the end game mechanic having to win a hand AFTER already having 10 points.

My first reaction to Custom Heroes was "That's it?". Using AEG's transparent card-building mechanic for something as traditionally light (as far as rules go, anyway) as a ladder climbing game seemed like a gratuitous bit of overkill. My first three rounds of the game, that quick take sort of held up.

Fortunately, I managed to play into some of the deeper rounds. Once the game escapes the vanilla starter phase, the customizable cards start to make a lot of sense. What is a very straight forward lead for each hand becomes a wonderful mix of combos, trumps, bluffs, and taunts. It's amazing how much more interesting laying down sets becomes when you can manipulate the values of the cards you are holding on the fly.

Things really take off after a round ends though, as all those fresh customized cards are then shuffled up and re-dealt to do it again. Then it gets really bonkers, as everyone plays the same game of modifying and tweaking card effects and values, but this time with cards that are already powered up or down.

It's all very silly, but fast and fun. Almost too fast. With the rules as written, the game can be over in as little as two hands. Since all the really fun stuff happens in rounds 4+, it seems odd for the game to have such a low scoring victory threshold. Fortunately, that's an easy fix. Just play to fifteen instead of ten.

Also, I figured out the difference between ladder climbing games and trick taking games when I learned to play this. I won my first trick and said "What do I do with these cards I scored?" When the answer was throw them into the discard pile, all became clear. I wonder why AEG doesn't know the difference. :D

The Card Crafting mechanic is fantastic!  Choices made to upgrade cards in one round add very interesting twists to the trick-taking in subsequent rounds.  I really love the dynamic feel to the game and components, and it's fun to see the deck evolve over a series of rounds.  That being said, the core mechanic of the game is significantly unimaginative.  Players have to play the same number of cards as whoever led the trick and always play a number equal or higher than the previous player.  The card crafting adds some variety and interest to this, but ultimately the game is just another trick-taking game with an interesting gimmick tacked on.

A couple negatives:
 - The awesome Card Crafting mechanic is wasted on a rather bland trick-taking game
 - Rules are unclear in a few aspects (instruction video on [url=https://www.alderac.com/custom-heroes/]AEG website[/url] clarifies the gaps)
 - Plastic power ups have a low-quality film on the cards that easily tears.  This can be removed but takes a considerable amount of time to do for every card.

At first, I had a hard time coping with its climbing only being by [i]n[/i]-of-a-kind sets, but once I saw how the number-modding affected things in practice, it was quite clear that runs just wouldn't be functional: The range of 1 – 10 can quickly become like −2 – 19. The economy of using cards' superpowers ends up pretty interesting: Pay the printed cost to trigger the effect, or just take a coin for not using the power.

I really like that the premium-grade sleeves are made of softer material, so the corners don't eviscerate you. The actual modding of the cards, while it does all the pivotal and interesting things to the game, lengthens and slows it to a point that it sort of undoes what I consider one of the primary merits of a trick-taking game: super-quick play.

If you are aware that it works like a warped, mutating climbing game, but plays at a more contemplative pace, I think you are ready to enjoy it!

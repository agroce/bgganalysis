Love the way this game makes worker placement both a time and space element. I can literally visualize planning moves ahead in time and I can watch other players do the same. Individual player powers at the beginning of the game are just imbalanced enough to make it fun. Cool components too.

Rating based on one play. Fun, super dry euro with innovative take on worker placement. Feels more strategic than tactical (and I'm unfortonately more of a tactical player, despite prefering strategy games...). Thinky but turns tend to be rather quick anyway. Great with three (would guess it's also good with two). Want to play again.

RATING: 7.5
A worker placement game with a great unique mechanic (gears), and simple options but tough decisions.

Set in the time of the Mayans, this is yet another worker placement game(!), however this time, there are actually some nice new aspects combined with tried and true mechanics.  Your goal is to of course, accumulate the most points by the end of the game, and there are 2 in-game scoring rounds, and a final scoring.  On your turn, your choices appear simple: 1)place a worker(s), or 2) take back a worker(s).  You CANNOT do both even though many times you want to.  Your placements are on moving gears, of which there are 5 of (with a central gear that moves them all), and the longer you leave your worker, the better the payoff.  However, you will need to take them off on occasion simply because you have no more to place- also if you wait too long, they will get nothing.  As well, you have several workers, but the more you place, the more expensive it gets.  

The gears provide: 1) resources (wood) and food/currency (corn), 2) better but more scarce resources (wood, stone, gold, skulls), 3) ability upgrades and construction/buildings and temple sacrifices, 4) more workers and flexible options to use currency, and 5) big point generators where you place skulls.  There are 4 checkpoints in the game where you either score points or collect resources IF you've been good to the gods, and where you have to feed your workers (or lose points like Agricola).  There are several different paths here, you can go crazy building buildings which generate points and give small bonuses and abilities, you can go for skulls which provide big points, you can go heavy on sacrifices for the gods which pay out points 3 times during the game, you can do a bit of everything.  The theme works, and the game scales very well (2-players works great despite the seeding of initial dummy players/blocks).  The gear mechanic looks and plays great, very impressive component implementation.

Tentative first play rating. Loved the game, but concerned about the length (it took us about 4 hours). I think if everyone is familiar with the game and can read the decision space quickly, it might play a whole lot faster. We were definitely speeding up toward the second half of the game. I was surprised to find that the challenging part of the game was not the gears, but calculating when you want to put pieces on and take them off the board and in what combination you want to do it. Corn management was also critical. It feels a lot like the mandala of one of my favorite games, Trajan. You always have to put a worker on the board or take one off, so timing becomes key. Very interesting dynamics & the alternating resource/point scorings really cause ebbs and flows in the game. I also like the variability of the monuments being different each game. This game feels like it would be best if played regularly, which sadly my group does not tend to do. Still, very much recommended.

RATING: 6.5
Der Zahnradmechanismus ist schön. Aber leider verlässt sich das Spiel zu sehr darauf und verschenkt anderweitig sein Potenzial. 
Z.B. die Gebäude und Monumente, die man baut, haben weder Bilder noch Namen, sind einfach lieblos gestaltete Siegpunktplättchen. Zudem spielen sie im Spiel keine weitere Rolle, bringen weder Vorteile, noch spielt die Anzahl/Kombination der Gebäude irgendeine Rolle.
Somit geht zum einen der thematische Anstrich verloren, zum anderen ist es vom Spielgefühl her trocken, nur ein reines Siegpunkt sammeln anstatt etwas aufzubauen.

Ein weiterer Punkt ist, dass man gezwungen ist, sich, auf einen bestimmten Siegpunktpfad festzulegen, und dann ist der Rest des Spiel nur noch Rechnerei, um hier und da noch einen Punkt mehr rauszuholen. Das führt gegen Ende zu Grübelorgien. Es fehlt zudem auch an Spieldynamik und Flexibilität.

Wirklich schade um den tollen Zahnradmechanismus, das hätte so leicht ein echter Kracher werden können.  Für die ersten 1-2 Partien ist es trotzdem spannend, um den Zahnradmechanismus mal auszuprobieren, doch der schlecht konzipierte Rest verdirbt den Wiederspielreiz.

So ist es leider ein Blender, faszinierend auf den ersten Blick, doch dann wird man ernüchtert.

There isn't anything very new here, except for the cog-turning, which isn't really a new mechanic - just a different presentation of things we've seen before in games like Village - i.e. workers increase their yield the longer they take over their task. The multiple routes to victory, buildings with production costs, and differing victory point generators, all feel like they were pulled straight from Ninjato, or Stone Age, or Walnut Grove, or any of a list of other worker placement games. It's quite a heavy implementation of the genre, and that might appeal to some - certainly heavier than all the afore-mentioned titles (except arguably Village). It looks great, but the theme doesn't really come through. All in all, it's an interesting resource-conversion, multi-player solitaire, puzzle, but there are many other choices if you want a game in this mould.

After a second play, I am even more disappointed in this game. It's a straight-up resource-conversion exercise, with no thematic integration at all. I convert grain into wood, to advance a step in an unspecified technology, which gives me additional wood, allowing me to build an un-named, un-illustrated "building", which gives me more grain. Rinse and repeat. I like dry, relatively themeless Euros, but this really is one step too far, and actually feels a little boring. The vast number of interconnected resources and action-spaces feel indulgent, and the whole thing is unwieldy - similar to another over-hyped, flabby, recent title, Bora Bora. 

I have met many people who like this game, so there is clearly fun to be had here, and I won't turn down future games, but I won't be seeking it out.

LIKE: Many many options. Waiting longer to take an action using the big gears, is different and enjoyable than other games. The crystal skull resource token is pretty.
DISLIKE: Overwhelming with the number of paths, but the expansion helps give direction with asynchronous powers. Minimal player interaction.

OVERALL: Solid game, I can see why it is well liked. I wish there was a touch more interaction, but I think competing for the different spots is still a good amount. The tension is there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The gears aren't a gimmick and make the game much smoother to play.

Definitely a typical Euro resource conversion game, but the addition of a temporal layer to the gameplay makes it stand out.  I was also terrible at the game initially and got crushed online, which only made me want to play it more.  Unfortunately, playing online before buying made me aware of a potentially dominant/broken strategy that I likely wouldn't have discovered on my own. 

Still a great game though, even if it is mainly an exercise in min/maxing.

The gimmick of the wheel is fetching, but this game is more than that. It is worker placement - pay to put and pull to get the benefit. But the paths are quite fun and the tension is rich - always one short of what you want. It plays fast if folks plan a bit. There is a bums rush to certain scoring areas - and that's the wonderful conflict in the game. There's significant replay due to the random buildings and monuments for end game scoring. I really like it.

RATING: 9.7
Euro de mecánica muy original con los engranajes, de colocación de trabajadores y gestión de acciones/recursos a la altura de otros buenos juegos euros, como Caylus.  Escala bien a pesar de los trabajadores neutrales aunque es más interesante jugando con 4. El tema no está mal elegido pero el juego es muy euro puro, muy seco, abstracto y sesudo.
Tras varias partidas te das cuenta que la partida depende de la config inicial tanto de losetas de jugador, como sobretodo de los tipos de edificios, y aun así hay diferentes estrategias por las que optar, dependiendo también del número de jugadores y del desarrollo de la partida: hacerse con los templos, con los edificios, o con las calaveras... etc. por no decir la elección de conseguir trigo o transformarlo, y sobretodo la elección de hacerte o no con más trabajadores, para hacer más acciones, teniendo en cuenta su mayor coste de mantener. Es un jue-ga-zo de sobresaliente de los de calentarte la cabeza de lo lindo. Se juega genial por la BGA y no veo ninguna estrategia ganadora, como se comentó en su día, a raíz de las impresiones de las primeras partidas ;)

The designers must have been drunk when they've got the idea for this game. "How can we enhance rondel? I know, let's have five of them."

After two plays of this game, I've ranked it at #8 on my [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/143773/admiralacfs-game-rankings]list of all-time favorite games[/url].  It's a fantastic brain-burner of a worker placement game.  I love the way the gears are built into the mechanics of the game.  They're not just a gimmick, they really make the game what it is.  The game has a deep level of strategy, but turns move rather quickly because players can make plans while waiting for their turns, and on your turn there aren't so many options as to cause analysis paralysis.

I've played with 3 and 4 players, and the 4 player game does feel a bit more crowded, but I wouldn't say this is any better or worse, just different.

If I had any concerns about the game, it would be with replayability.  There's not a lot that changes from game to game, and the number of age 1 buildings seems rather low, so you could make plans for acquiring a certain building and be pretty sure it'll show up.  This is only a minor concern at this point, and I hope to get this one to the table a lot more.

The wheel mechanic isn't just a gimmick. This is a clever euro that feels like it has multiple paths to victory. I want to play this more just to explore the game space and what's possible.

This is a solid worker placement game with a unique time management twist and a very well designed board. 

+ elegant and ingenious systems
+ your action choice is very simple: on your turn you either put workers, or take them back
+ simple rules, easy to learn, hard to master
+ very deep experience in a short playing time (two hours, once you know how to handle it)
+ very high replay value 
+ a rather high addiction factor for this type of game: once set on the table you just want to play it over and over again 
+ add the expansion and you'll have a mind-blowing experience. (Endless possibilities, and a very competitive game ... in the same short time.)

- first couple of games might be intimidating, and scare off some players, because the strategies are not obvious the first few games

Brilliant gateway to medium game.  The gear mechanism is more than just a gimmick--it provides for some very interesting planning opportunities--and I really like the simplicity of either being required to add workers or take workers on each turn (not a combination of both) which, again, provides for interesting decisions.  

When not playing the game, painting the gears can be an enjoyable distraction.

A great, "spin" on worker placement, Tzolkin is easily one of my favorite games with the action drafting mechanism. You play workers onto one of several gears. Each gear is turning during play and associated with a family of actions that enable specific strategems in play to be executed. In order to take an action, you must remove one of your placed workers at the right time and position on the said gear. This is the core of the game that all the other mechanisms and options of the game rest on. Other than a fragile board, I find I have nothing negative to say about Tzolkin. I am glad I picked it up at pax east a few years ago and will probably never get rid of it.

- Difficult to catch on until you've played through a full game.


Why it's previously-owned:
Played this game to death online, dozens of times.  It's still an amazing game, but every time that someone would suggest it in real life, I'd find myself always wishing that they'd pick something else that I couldn't just play online.
This got traded as part of a huge online swap.

A unique worker placement game with the element of time. You have plan ahead a lot in this game which may feel unforgiving if you plan poorly. There are different tracks to climb and buildings to collect to get you special powers. The theme and components are very nice.
The expansion is a must-have.

Thoughts: Great game if you like planning ahead and minor player interaction.

Similar games: 
Macao: less thematic and less planning ahead.
Agricola: a big part is planning a strategy based on the given cards at the beginning of the game.

Worker placement with future planning plus a multitude of paths and a side serving of feed your people.  The cog mechanism is the big draw (it's so... big!), but you'll stay for the depth.  There's so much going on it'll take a few plays to appreciate the diversity, but it's there.  Still, not my favorite, largely because it's all in the future planning/timing.  So much of the game is wrapped up in it that it overshadows the otherwise pleasant diversity - it *is* the game.  And that's not my favorite.  But a really cool game all the same.

RATING: 8
Tzolk'in is a really clever euro-game, that I wanted to try for a long time. My interest was mostly caught by the gears, because the rest of the components, while being high quality, never impressed me for their visual impact. Having finally played it, I can say that those gears are probably a gimmick, but they are also pretty functional to the smooth flow of the game-play.

Speaking of game-play... Based on what I've heard and read on line, I always though of Tzolk'in as a huge brain-burner with a pretty heavy rule-set. When I actually tried it, I was instead surprised by how simple the turns flow in this game. This is not a light game by any mean, but the heaviness of the experience doesn't come from the amount of mechanisms you have to keep in mind in order to play it. The challenge of this game is all about managing your workers and programming your moves many turns ahead... and that's the kind of heaviness that I like.

There's so many things in Tzolk'in that I enjoy: the tech-threes, the tracks of the Gods, the buildings and the monuments. All these elements intertwine perfectly to create a deep and interesting game-play. Yet what really impressed me the most about Tzolk'in is its take on the worker placement idea and its element of time management. I've never played a game before where the time felt so much like a resource. You have to manage your workers in order to meet your goals at the right time and there's even deadlines for which you have to prepare for. While this might be considered stressful by someone - and it probably is - I find it really cool and innovative.

The only complaint I have with about the game is its lack of variety. There's surely multiple strategies you can take, but I just think they don't feel different enough and you can't never actually completely ignore some specific elements, like the Gods tracks for example. Probably this issue could be solved by the expansion, which I'm eager to try. Minor complaint aside though, Tzolk'in The Mayan Calendar is a brilliant strategic game, that has a lot of challenges to offer, and one I'd like to play often given the chance.

[With the expansion]

I think this is my favorite worker placement game.  It's attractive and the mechanics are both unique and intuitive enough to learn quickly and remember without large time spent re-learning rules.

Nice features:  it's not just solitaire, but not passive-aggressive cruelty, like most worker placement.  You may chance your opponent's plans, but usually won't just take the thing they needed above all else.  Starting player management is actually interesting and fun, rather than an annoying aspect.  Variable setup makes it play different, and most paths are potentially viable.

Broken Broken Broken. I gave a 2 because it's fun to move the gears.

Why is it broken? I'm surprised you ask. You must not have played a lot with the experts..... What is a broken game? A broken game is a game when ONE AND ONE ONLY AND ALWAYS THE SAME ONE strategy leads to victory. Meaning, if you pursue any other strategy, no matter how good you pursue it and how clever you are, the noob doing the ONE WINNING strategy will outflank you eyes wide shut.

In Tzolk'in case, this strategy is get to 6 workers very fast. Don't feed them by converting wheat to resources. Row 2 level III tech as fast as you can. Pile up, pile up, pile up, pile up like there is no tomorrow. On cycle 4, reap everything, build everything, climb everywhere. and you win with a 200+ score. That's why you don't see any players now doing the skull strategy.

Don't listen to experts who tell you this strategy is counterable. It is not. Unless by the same strategy which proves it is broken. On the contrary, Puerto Rico is not a broken game.

Good game, though I'm terrible at it.  Gears are a gimmick, but a good gimmick so I can't complain.  Strategy is pretty much a black box unfortunately, and there's not much in my brain to deal with remembering the standard opening moves and how best to counter them.  I don't really like it enough to buy it, but I'll play it every so often when it gets brought.  The group hasn't brought it much though.

2-4(4)

The worker placement system is fine enough, but ultimately pretty standard. Really, it's just a form of promoting your placed workers each turn. The gears are just a means of doing that promotion, while also being visually cool.

That's fine. I suppose the big thing about this should be that you can only place or remove workers (and placing costs money based on how many you place). Which leads to some serious planning so that you can consolidate your turns (and not be removing multiple turns in a row, or that you have the resources to execute when you remove).

Another of those games where half the board won't be loaded up by game end (some skulls will be empty, several cult tracks won't be advanced, technologies will not be upgraded, etc.), and thus ultimately sort of just a game to specialize as best you can in certain domains.

Fun enough, but I think others of this oeuvre are more interesting to me, overall.

RATING: 7
I find Tzolk'in a game of two halves.  There is the innovative, engaging half - the cogs - coupled to same old same old resource conversion to score points or gain abilities.

The five cogs each perform a different function.  Most provide varieties of resources, while one of them you go to to make sacrifices and score points. There is a challenging trade-off between the length of time you leave your worker inactive on a cog and the rising pay-off you will receive.  The mechanics of the cogs mean that all the turn by turn adjustments are made with a minimum of fuss - and scoring turns are kept account of. Using only six of 13 monuments each game and, similarly, fewer than the 32 building cards provided, creates variability.  

On the debit side, conversion of resources into technologies and vps seems formulaic and uninteresting.  Player interaction is of the minimal taking stuff before my opponent variety seen so often in efficiency games. 

Production quality is good.  The parts that literally move, fit well together.  Tzolk'in features yet another set of icons and some are opaque to the novice player.

Great eurogame. The rules are easy to teach but at the same time they provide a lot of options to the players.
the 'gears' mechanic is very interesting and has that 'wow' factor. Players are gathering resources in order to construct building and monuments while at the same time they try to please the gods and advance technologically. Beautifull, shiny board. Love the little plastic blue skulls. 

One of the best releases of Essen 2012!

In my opinion, this is a bit over-hyped.  Don't get me wrong--any gamer will find this palatable.  However, aside from the unique gear element (and the subsequent "progressive worker-placement" quality of the game), there's nothing here you haven't seen before.  It strikes me as a hybrid of Agricola and Caylus in terms of the game mechanics.  And, this game is in the same league as those games in terms of complexity as well.  You have the constant concern for food you have in Agricola, along with the ever-present sense that you're barely surviving (if, indeed, you are).  I am reminded of Caylus in terms of the multiple paths to victory, the technology tracks (similar to the favor tracks in Caylus), the buildings you can construct, etc.  This is a game where noobs will get crushed by anyone with experience, which also seems true of Agricola and Caylus.  There are a lot of paths to victory and you have to plan ahead quite a bit; hence, it's a true strategy lover's delight, to be sure.  There's a lot going on in the game and it can be overwhelming at first.

An interesting worker placement and advancement game, innovative but a bit too punishing to be exceptional.

EDIT: after another game, I upgraded my rating to 8. Even though I get to do less than I wanted to, making significantly more points as I gain experience makes Tzolk'in enjoyable. It is one of the euros that will see more time on the gaming table until something better comes along.

Most innovative use of the worker placement mechanic I've seen to date.  About a third of the way through my first play of this one I had that glorious "A-ha!" moment where I thought I had figured it out, and then two thirds of the way in it all came crashing down around me.  This game gives me that feeling in my gut that I'm playing something very special and satisfying and I really wish I designed it myself haha.

RATING: 7
Very interesting and different kind of worker placement game.  Certainly not obvious on first play exactly what should be done, and the learning curve for the action/iconography takes a bit of time.  Played with four, all first timers, and I liked it.  

Second play with three, not quite as good, though faster.

Third play, with three, a little better than second play with three.  Four is still probably preferable.

Fourth play, with four. Assuredly, this game is an excellent advanced worker placement game, but I do feel like the god track route IS the highest percentage way to win, and thus, the seeming variety of things you want to do in this game is considerably reduced, dare I say, simplified.  This is okay, but it does reduce the desire to play again, "to explore" the game further.  Presumably, then, the game is then played by more experienced players with much more competitive attention paid to the god tracks, and on occasion, a synergistic monument that appears at the beginning of the game.

This game has standard to sub-standard mechanics. The novelty gear, is for me the only innovative thing this game has going for it. But it gets old quickly, very quickly. It's just basically a convenient way to make a standing worker gather more/better resources. But watching workers revolve on a piece of gear and wait for them to reach their stop is as exciting as watching paint dry. The theme is pasted on and I was bored after 15 minutes. No thanks.

Tentative review because we played this all wrong...
I won the game primarily by currying favor with the gods and earning crystal skulls. The scoring possibilities are dizzying and the wheels aren't just a gimmick. Here is the key to the wheels: they force you to be really careful about timing. You only get to remove your pip or place on a given turn..thus the timing of the wheel almost feels like playing the cymbals in an orchestra: you're waiting for the exact right moment to hit your note.

Maybe the greatest worker placement game? (Sorry Agricola, I love you too.) Tzolkin wins against the competition for its replayability, number of valid strategies, and the depth that the unique resource "time" adds to the game. It doesn't hurt that the game looks and feels great (turning those gears is just so satisfying). 

The true test is this game's longevity in my collection: I am always thrilled to whip this baby out, and the same cannot be said of every game that has dwelt in my stack for as many years. I'd recommend this game to anyone.

A game with cogwheels! My first impression was that the game looked complicated and somewhat fiddly, but after a round or two most things fell in place and the games main mechanic began to shine. Every turn the cogwheels rotate, moveing placed workers. Usually the more a worker is moved the better the action it can take become. The game has some rough edges, but flows on rather nicely. Have played it once and would like to play it again.

I had a ton of fun the first two plays. Then on the third play I played with a stranger at BGGCon that said "you want some helpful tips" and he proceeded to tell us the broken element. It ruined this game.

So if playing with all new players, this is an amazing game. If you learn of the broken mechanic I'd steer clear as it ruins the game.

This feels very much like Caylus, which is a good thing.  Workers need to be left to ripen for maximum effect, but you need to be able to do something while this is happening with your other workers.  Turns need to be planned a few moves in advance if you want to get anywhere.

Intricate and innovative worker placement, not only for its tactile gimmick of revolving gears but for the sheer number of decisions you can make when picking up your workers from the various spaces. I love that you can take lower action space actions by paying extra corn, and the feeding people mechanic here is used just as sensibly as it is in other games. Temples, monuments, buildings, and tech tracks! Lots to think about even with the core game alone, and 2 or 3 player games with dummy workers are also fairly easy to navigate.

10/24/14: There really is a power curve that you need to follow, and you need to build deep reserves of corn.  If you run out, your engine and endgame sputter to a stop.

Like everyone else, I saw the gears and got really excited about it. Sadly, the calendar gear turning system does not live up to the hype: it is a nice idea to get some excitement into worker placement, but the fact that all the gears (except one) rotate with the same, slow speed made me think about the point of all of it - it really does not do anything new.

But I could have lived with it if the theme would have been interesting. Instead, the Maya topic is reduced to resource conversion and some lazy building and technology system. And it is not even done very well or with any noticable player interaction. All the mechanics feel patched in to add some complexity to the gear idea. But it really takes more collecting wood cubes, corn tokens and developing a 3-space-"take one more" tech tree to make an interesting game. 

I really would have wanted this to work better. :(

Place one or more of you workers on the gears, at the earliest available space(s). Or take one or more of your previously placed workers back and take the appropriate action(s). Apart from the details of the actions and the feeding that's basically the game.
I continue to score poorly compared to my opponents usually. Not struggling to feed normally, but scoring well, from temples especially, eludes me.

Like many worker-placement euros, players are utilizing their workers to gain resources and then utilizing them to spend those resources in a variety of different ways (Get VP directly, build up their engine, etc). But unlike any worker-placement game before, this game has gears, which is essentially a mechanized version of multiple rondels. See, each time the gears spin, the benefit that the workers get when they are removed becomes stronger (typically). Thus, players must carefully plan the placement and removal of workers, so that they can obtain VP efficiently.

If I had to criticize the game, there seems to be some consensus with competitive players that the 2-player game doesn't have as many viable strategies as the 3/4-player game. That being said, I haven't played the game enough to understand those balance issues. Still, I find the game brain-burning, interesting, and refreshing.

Y yo que pensaba que este iba a ser mi juego de referencia!!!!
es que me funde el cerebro. No estoy capacitado para poder preparar con anetelación, con tanta antelación, los turnos y sus ventajas. Siempre quiero tener queocos en otros sitios donde se encuentan los míos. y siempre quiero recoger algunos de ellos y no todos.... Me causa una frustración del carajo, lo cuaj no quiere decir que el juego sea malo precisamente. Vistoso es un rato, los componentes geniales y las reglas semifáciles. El problema viene con las mecánicas y mi incapacidad de poder controlar la partida. Capeo el pemporal como puedo pero nada más.

Me quedo sorprendido de lo fácil que resultan las reglas y lo fácil que resulta arrancarse a jugar todos en la mesa pero cuando empieza el tomate... ahí empiezo a fibrilar y en vez de disfrutar como un bellaco, veo girar los discos a más velocidad de la que lo hacen....

Un buen juegaco pero demasiado para mí.
no me niego a una partida pero pensé yo que se le acercaría al Caverna o al Caylus...

The mechanic of placing your workers, waiting and then pulling them off to get an action is great.

Don't play it enough.

RATING: 5
The addition of time to the tried-and-true worker placement mechanics is a blessing: it really works great. Also, the theme is actually interesting, and the mechanics,m while simple, make the game very challenging.

I'll have to play it some more times, but it's looking good.

UPDATE: It's a decent game, but it's got just too much AP for what it is. Down to a 6.

UPDATE: I haven't felt the need to play this in over a year. I really don't like it. I can stand playing it, but I probably wouldn't want to.

The game play was fine, but I feel that it suffers from too many options with too many tracks to try to earn victory point, and too much artwork trying to create a theme when one is not there (very much like Village in both respects).  

The color scheme is nice, but the player piece colors get lost on the board due to their similarity and the iconography is often obscured by the pieces making it difficult to see where one is and what options are coming up for a player in the tracks.

Creative use of time for piece movement, though.

Tzolk'in is nicely constructed.  There are several point scoring routes, the temples seem to be the most important.  The clever part of the mechanism is having to tie up your workers for longer periods to secure the better rewards as they travel round the wheels.  The entry costs onto the wheel are higher of the initial places are full, but this also means you get a better reward or opportunity.  These al feel well balanced.  It is necessary always to plan ahead for your next move and you are likely to fall quickly into a reap and sew routine.  The feeding requirements are taxing and the opportunity for each player to move the cog twice can scupper plans.  Overall a well constructed game I am happy to explore further.  However it is not without its frustrations - someone else buys a temple or tile just as you attempt to.  And I would not call it fun.  A bit like playing a spreadsheet.  One player was caught woefully short of food and penalised.  Unsure if you can be penalised below zero points.  We played not.

High pain distribution with the tight corn economy, which is a plus. Like the gear gimmick. Really nice production. A little heavy on the iconography, but so it goes these days. However gameplay does nothing to separate it from a crowded field of similar 'vibe' games and make me grab for it over any other WP optimization game. All of this is based on 1 play and I'd probably give it another chance at some point.

RATING: 9.5
A worker placement game with a time component to it, in which the longer your worker stays on the board the better actions he can perform.

On your turn you just have 2 options, either you place workers on the various spaces on the board, and pay for the cost of placing workers, or you take workers from the board and execute the specific actions.

Even though placing several workers on your turn has an increasing cost it is always good to have more than the 3 starting workers because since you always have to place or remove workers, if you only have 3 most likely you'll have to remove some before they reach any significant position on the wheels, if you have several workers you can each turn place only 1 worker and that gives you time to keep your workers on the wheel for longer time.

Too bad it only goes to 4 players. But with the expansion it goes up to 5.

A beharangozók alapján egy forgó kerekekkel bővített Caylus-Egizia klónra számítottam, de ez a játék sokkal több ennél! Persze feltűnnek benne már ismert mechanizmusok, de annyira újszerű az egész, hogy mindenképp ajánlom a worker placement műfaj kedvelőinek. Már csak azért is, mert nem csak a kerekek visznek bele újdonságot, hanem a munkások menedzselése is nagyon egyedi.
A játék nagyon jól leteszteltnek tűnik, nagyon letisztult grafikailag is, szinte semmit nem kell fejben tartani, mert a színkódolás nagyon egzakt, magától értetődő. Talán 1 vagy 2 helyen van vitatható rész a szabályban, de egyébként profi. Mint ahogy a kivitel is, az egyik legszebb játék, amit eddig láttam. A mi partinkban szinte mindenki másféle stratégián volt, mégis elég közeli eredmények születtek. Egyáltalán nem nyelvfüggő. Volt az asztalnál, aki hosszúnak találta, de szerintem bő 3 óra simán belefér egy ilyen kaliberű játéknál. Az épületek némi szerencsét hoznak a játékba, de ez is elviselhető. A monumentumok és a kezdőlapkák biztosítják az újrajátszhatóságot. Tetszik az egyes kerekek akcióinak tematizálása is, szinte mindegyik kerék kínál egy-egy önálló stratégiát (a megfelelő fejlesztéssel, templommal, stb. kombinálva).
Szerintem elsőosztályú játék, esélyes a kedvenc kategóriára:)
---
Két fővel is kipróbáltam. Nem sokkal könnyebb, a sok fenn lévő "fiktív" bábu elég jól bekavar, bár kiszámíthatóbb azért így, mint 4-en, mert ezek nem kerülnek folyton le-föl. Nagyon sokutasnak tűnik a játék! Még jobban tetszett, mint elsőre!

Nagyon jó, hogy a több ember nem jelent feltétlen sikert, az etetéssel ez jól ki lett egyenlítve...

Very nice-looking worker placement game especially because of the moving gears, that takes the whole planing-ahead strategy just shy of over-the-top for me. It takes a good 1.5-2h to play (rather close to the advertised playtime) and has some interesting choices and some frustration points in store for the players. Overly, I'd rather not get rid of it from a collection, but it is definitely not a game that I would be bringing out every time.

A heavier intermediate-weighted game.  I originally bought this after playing only once so I could paint the cogs.  This is now one of my favourite games.  The mechanic is unique, the theme works well and strategizing during this game never gets boring.  Stressful at times, but never boring.

Worker placement game with a REAL twist.  The gear mechanism works very well, and makes life easier.  The point in the game is that the longer you keep the worker on the board, not using it, the better the effect.  Each time, you either put workers, or take workers back.
To me, the problem is that there are far too many different effects and things to take care about, making the game a bit confusing.  But this might perfectly be the big point for many people.
Do not really like the shine of the board, but for the rest, production is really good and visually great.

Tzolk'in is a great worker-placement strategy title and you must really think in this one to achieve your victory.
I like that you should focus on one, maybe two paths during your playtime and it may change from game to game(obviously there are situational choices too)! And after few games you will notice getting better and better and see some interesting choices you have not seen before:-)
Deep strategy, many choices, outstanding looks and components (cogs, skulls, board!), also great for 2 players. Each playtime is fresh and unique even with such a small randomness factor. Highly recommended.

RATING: 8.5
This was my most anticipated game of Essen 2012, and it didn't disappoint.

The heart of Tzol'kin is  of course the worker placement "on wheels": every turn each player must place one or more workers OR retrieve one or more workers and execute their actions.

It seems that there is a lot of different approaches to victory (at least four different "strong" strategies), and it plays very differently than any other (worker placement) game I played: the place or retrieve mechanic has some resemblance with Manhattan Project, but the feeling in Tzol'kin is very different.

The graphic design is superlative: the cogs and puzzle-like board are of course a piece of design, but every information in the game is cleverly depicted on the board or on player mats, so there's no need to ever check the rulebook!
The components are top notch, with only a minor complaint to be made about the fragility of the folding parts of the board.

A great game by CGE and a couple of italian designers!

This is one of those games where scoring is so infrequent that it can take a couple of games to figure out what you'd want to do.

The timing of jumping on and jumping off the gears was interesting.  The other mechanics were not as impressive.  As for components, I thought the chrystal skulls were a nice touch. 

Update:  Buildings are underpowered and cost too much.  The corn track is the most powerful and unbalanced when player(s) use it to move up Temples.

Update 2:  I only want to play with the expansion.  After more plays, I realize that any track and any building may be worth pursuing.

Hmmm.  I had high expectations for this, but not enough to impel me to buy it.  Good thing.  It seems like they forced this mish-mash of worker placement with a victory point buffet.  True, the gears are quite useful and a nice innovation, but it doesn't really add much besides convenience.  Production quality's excellent.  A little heavy on the iconography.  I should play again sometime, to give it another chance.  But that's what I said about Agricola...

I like the feeding stress for this game as well,  reminds me of Agricola, another fav of mine. There's multiple pathways to victory for this game and I'm keen to discover more of it!

This game is stunning and makes a great first impression. It is a great twist on worker placement. A lot of options and a variety of ways to win. It really rewards repeated plays. From what I can tell, very little randomness or luck. A new player doesn't have a chance against an experienced one. I've heard there are one or two dominant strategies that are hard to beat if other players aren't aware of it and interfering at least some. The expansion is supposed to help with this. The re-playability may be hurt by this some, in the base game anyway, but I'm really enjoying this a lot right now.

First Play: I'd only read the rules once so tried to summarise the game play and dipped into the rule book for details. Its well laid out and clear so we got most things right.

Production quality of all companents is excellent. Just a realpleasure to look at before you start to play.

There is alot to consider here and ample opportunity for screwage. The double twist of the cog for the start player is very nasty.

The need to remove and add is a very special twist. This game will go top 100 very quickly. My rating will probably improve with more plays.

Second Play: I love this game but I am crap at it. Two games last in both.

I am a big fan of Stone Age, and though the mechanics in this game are dissimilar enough to make it unique (not to mention the gears were wicked cool), it was easy to understand and teach my kids.  And everyone insisted on having a chance to turn the gears to move the calendar forward.  A lot of fun and a lot of replayability.

Word of caution, however, about assembly and storage.  The gear assemblies are heavy enough that for the largest section (which includes 2 gears that attach to a board section that folds in the middle to store), the board layers began to separate at the edge.  this was due to the weight of the gears pulling on the board where the sections for the two gears meet while I was attaching the gears for the first time.

I fear that storing this game on its side would aggravate the problem, so would suggest storing it flat.  By the way, I was able to pretty quickly mend the separated piece so that it does not show.

This game is so engaging and fun.  The aesthetics put it over the top for me...I am glad I took the time to paint the wheels because this is a game that I will be playing for years to come.  There is mid range and long term strategy to consider but each turn is simply placing or pulling off workers.  An incredible blend of interaction where there is a trade off to every decision made.  I like worker placement to begin with, but this game does it differently.  It is a game of timing to set yourself up for the future and there are several viable paths to victory.

When I saw the box I was excited to see a 90min worker placement game.  With 4 players and about 25 turns that's not going to happen unless everyone plays each and every turn in under a minute.  So definitely this is more 150min+ game.

Even so, the physical components, etc are great.  Nice theme.  The mechanics work and you aren't punished as much for not being the starting player as you are in agricola or caylus.  Everyone has enjoyed the games.  At this point, I would rank this ahead of Agricola or Caylus, but that's with only 2 plays under our belts.

This is a game that could have been Top 10 material for me. I absolutely loved the way the gears worked. You have to invest your workers and plan when you will take them off for the most benefit. It had lots of interesting decisions all over those gears. But then they threw in all the other junk. With the temples, the developments, the buildings, etc. It was all just too many added rules for no apparent reason. As a result there is too much going on for me to have any concept what was going on, and forget about teaching my family. So there's a solid game hiding in there, but I doubt I'll explore it more because they just added too much stuff to the game.

RATING: 7.25
Okay... So we have an innovative gimmick with the interconnecting rotating wheels and the timing of placing and retrieving your workers, but do we have a good game? I would say that this is a good mid weight Euro Worker Placement game that takes a few games to grok the different paths to victory. It is definitely not a gateway game, but I need to play it a few more times to see if it falls into a gamers game category. Despite the feeling of "been there, done that" with certain aspects of this game, it still manages to hold my attention. 

The production values are good, but the rotating wheels kept getting jammed despite the fixes offered on the publishers website and some of the boards backs began peeling off. Also a minor quibble, the glossy board, despite being pretty, sometimes gets in the way with the glare of the light in certain angles.

Update: Upon playing this a couple of more times, there is more than meets the eye and the layers of depth and strategies are starting to reveal themselves.

RATING: 8
A great worker placement game. I love the restriction of having to either place or retract workers every turn - never both and never neither. Makes planning ahead absolutely crucial, which I love. One possible problem is that Crystal Skulls MIGHT be overpowered. Will have to play more to determine this. Even if they turn out to be overpowered this isn't a HUGE deal, as everybody going for them evens it out. But it is slightly boring if you HAVE to go for something to win. Again, time will tell.

This is definite worker placement with a few different options for scoring points. I was particularly pleased with the fact that the gears appear to be a useful component... they aren't just a gimmick. Food seems to be a common struggle throughout the game. There appear to be several different ways to set yourself up for scoring points and I look forward to playing this one more.

In my second play, I overcompensated for a shortage of food in the first game.  That plus a plethora of other bad choices left me with half the points of first place.  Yikes!  I do need to play this again.

Things started coming together better for me in my third play.  I finished second and was able to pick up two nice scoring monuments.  I still see where I am missing opportunities, after the fact.  I've upped my rating fom 8 to 8.5.

After 9 plays, Tzolk'in is becoming one of my favorite games. I still seem to struggle with it at times, but I love what it presents. There are many different interactive parts to the game, but each turn boils down to either put a guy or guys on the board or take a guy or guys off the board. That's it in a nicely, complex game.  The Tribes & Prophecies expansion just makes it even better.

I should have liked this one but it just didn't click. The game felt too abstract and it never felt like I was building or accomplishing anything. I was just collecting points. I'm not really a fan on 'point soup' games and this one leans in that direction. The best thing about the game is that it has low turn-to-turn upkeep. The gears do keep the game moving at a nice clip.

This game plays very well. I enjoyed it and the people I played with did, except for one player who found that the rules were not as intuitive as they should be and kept trying to do actions that were not allowed by the rules even into the last round. He kept wanting the game to work like Stone Age and was frustrated by the more advance planning required. I was fascinated by this and felt that it had more strategic depth.

Not sure it is worth all the hype but an interesting worker placement game. Not a lot wrong with it, although perhaps it might be argued that the whole thing is a little fiddly - not in the physical movement of the cogs but in all the tracks, 3 god tracks, 4 tech tracks, 5 outer wheels, plus the basic buildings and the wonders. Teetering towards the Bora Bora "too much to do" syndrome.

So, fun, but perhaps spoiled for me by too much hype.

Szeretem ezt a játékot, pedig csak ritkán nyerek benne. Hogy miért? Mert folyton próbálom  úgy megnyerni, hogy nem direkt, hanem közvetetten haladok a templomon. Kicsit zavar, hogy a templomnak ekkora a pontszerző ereje és enélkül nem lehet nyerni vagy legalább második helyezettel zárni. Mindezek mellet egy szenzációs játék! Egyedi hangulattal és grafikával a játékmechanikáról már nem is szólva sokat, mert az viszi a pálmát.

The gears are what grabs everyone's attention and it's a neat way to work a "progression along a track" mechanic, where you need to stay moving forwards each turn to get to where you want. To allow this to happen, you must place or remove meeples from other tracks, so it's all about timing. This one is deeper than it looks and takes a few plays to work out the intricacies. Tidy!

Pretty enjoyable euro with an interesting mechanic.
It looks nice - the board makes up for the 'simplicity' of the pieces. The game flows nicely, though I don't see much competitiveness unless in a 4-player game. It's the temples during scoring phases that are a thing to watch but other than that, everyone tries to do their thing.
Watch out and save up corn for feeding times!
An enjoyable game.

RATING: 8
Tzolk'in is so pretty, it has a theme (with soundtrack it is awesome) but overall this game is very, very heavy. I mean, rules are simple but it is super hard to build anything in the game to make it works for You, like automatic mechanism for scoring points (game is all about this). With the bad decisions You can finish the game with much about 40-50 points and it is not good at all (experienced players can reach 90-100, it doesn't matter if You have fun playing this game even if You reach only 40) :) When I play this I feel the same like during Le Havre, so many things to do and not enough time. The game also forces You to harvest many corn baskets - it is money and food for workers. No corn or less than 2 baskets means serious trouble and You're actually out of the game for few turns trying to surivive and come back to the game plan. Rotating calendar is cool (1st player is in charge of rotation so everyone want to be first, game forces You to fight for the 1st player marker also :P) but such a shame it is colorless and just ugly :/ they could put cities colors on the specific modes of this calendar. It looks unfinished and dazzle. Finally - this is heavy strategy which can be overwhelming despite the look but definitely deserves to be #22 on BGG. Warning: You have to find right people to play this game with, just saying. Game can be stressful.

3p - IMO better than for 2p (I really enjoyed it)

Worker placement with a touch of point salad - should be on the list of games I hate ... but I don't at all.

Theme works for this - the Mayan calendar and the workers, all fits along with food as the currency. Lots to think about, deep interaction, strategy. 

Love it - and the expansion adds more replayability too. Although resource strategy just seems a bit better than others

Shame others don't share my enthusiasm, it doesn't get to the table as often as I'd like.

The rule book has 1 gap with the starting player, but therefor a mostly thematic game. The crystal skull was not really from the mayan culture (the skull is artwork from the 19th century an was manufactured in Europe).They had no tools around year 700 for such nice work. Oh sorry, this is only a game and not a mayan-simulation (but history is sometimes so genius). 
Simple actions as putting & taking workers are easy to explain. You only have to learn the symbols around the wheels. And you should know that the good buildings come in during the 2nd Time-Age. I had to bought the expansion and all the stuff, with both Mini-expansions fits in the basic box. A game for the decade 2010 to 2019!

Fun game. Rules are very easy, but gameplay is pretty deep. You either place workers on your turn or you take workers back, that's it. The cogs are more gimmick really, you could have just moved all your workers on a track on the next turn, but it is pleasing to the eye.

I'm not saying it's a bad game, but it just didn't jibe with me.  It had a very strong blocking aspect to it which made turn order very important.  There was also a lot to do -- it felt busy, like too many things were thrown into the soup... as I said, not a bad game and maybe I'm just getting tired of worker placement games, but I won't be looking to play this one again (I will if someone asks but I won't suggest it).

Es un juego de colocación de trabajadores, que tiene como novedad que los trabajadores se colocan sobre unas ruedas móviles que, en cada turno, al avanzar la rueda central que indica el paso del tiempo y controla la duración de la partida, cambian de posición.

Cuanto más tiempo pase un trabajador en una rueda en movimiento, más potente será la acción que pueda llevar a cabo, pero el jugador sacrifica uno de sus trabajadores durante varios turnos.

En su turno un jugador puede o colocar trabajadores (los que desee) o retirarlos (y entonces se ejecuta la acción).

Es sencillo de explicar, pero dificil de controlar y jugar bien. Hay muchas formas de obtener puntos. Me ha gustado mucho. Es muy original.

Una maravilla de juego, de colocación de trabajadores, en los que la intensidad de la acción es mayor cuanto más tiempo pasa el trabajador colocado (la acción se ejecuta cuando se recoge). 
En cada turno se mueve una rueda central que mueve otras cuatro, que contienen las aciones principales.
Hay muchas formas de puntuar y muchas estrategias posibles.. Es una delicia. 
Totalmente recomendable,eso sí, para jugones.

It's a unique idea, but the lack of interaction and cohesiveness of the design as a whole makes it lackluster for me.

Updated: after two more plays, getting familiar with the rules, I have to say, I love to play Tzolkin as much as Agricola... or even more. If You dislike Tzolkin after first game - just give it few more chances. Instrucion is awful, and symbols over board/buildings/etc are even worse, but do not discourage Yourself. It`s really fantastic game worth Your money.



My first impression was: exaggerated mechanic. Beside that - typical eurogame.

I like to play worker placement games, but this one stands head and shoulders above the others I've played. I can't think of anything this game has done wrong, it is so balanced. It offers just the right amount of choices for advancement on the tracks and scoring, that in my first play I felt in control of the game flow. The game is not overbearing, with too few actions, but allows you to combine just enough workers to do something. Players choose a starting hand that gets you focused on where you need to go. The wheels are what makes this game stand out, as the decision to place or resolve workers is tense every turn. Absolutely outstanding game, with a cool, thematic feel. UPDATE: Despite the development by other users of a "winning" strategy by flooding one of the gears with workers, if it were to appear in our games I would inform the other players how to stop it.

A very fun twist on an otherwise very straightforward worker placement game.

Some people complain that the gears are a gimmick. I think they make it super easy from a bookkeeping perspective to make time a factor in the game. Sure it could be done without the gears, but it would be much more difficult.

The turn structure is simple: Play workers or remove workers. The iconography makes sense at a glance. The hardest part is playing well!

Getting hopelessly behind can be frustrating, but pulling off a perfectly timed, multi-moved worker pull to get everything you need is incredibly rewarding

Just another eurogame, only this one has wheels that make it stand out. While I like the focus on programming and timing your actions, ultimately it feels similar to other games where you collect resources and transform them into VP. The different paths to victory might be a bit unbalanced, but I need more plays to confirm this suspicion. Although I will not refuse to play this game, I do not feel the need to own a copy.

The gears & stepping on+off are kinda cool. The rest of the resource collecting to convert to VPs is run of the mill.

Nothing broken. Just that worker placement to collect coloured cubes to convert to veeps is something that is WAY over done in hundreds of other euros.

A beyond painful point-salad exercise with a one-trick gimmick stuck among utterly forgettable conversion tables. Spreadsheet tables to slide your pieces on, turn A into B into C...zzzzzz.

I have a fair few unlogged plays for this game, and after repeated plays it really does seem that there's a very clearly dominant strategy (in a two player game anyway) that renders much of the amazingly designed board irrelevant. I'm unsure if we've just hit a bump in the road - one of us needing to work out an even better strategy to overcome it - but, for now, my rating has decreased from an 8.5. Seems daft to put all the planning and foresight into building monuments and buildings and managing the optimum number of workers when you can just spam the crystal skulls to offer the gods.

Amazing worker placement game. We wanted something a bit heavy but also a neat design without too much information overload and we got it with this one. It may looks heavy but once you learn the rules it's easy to play (not to decide how to play though). The dials gives it an extra flavour and it immediately get the attention to anyone new to the table. This one will stay on the table for long.

I'm liking this a lot more the more I play it. Between workers/buildings/temples/skulls there are lots of paths to victory, and decisions can be mind-bogglingly complex as you plan 3, 4, 5 turns in advance on multiple tracks. There is a ton of replay value here, not even counting the expansion (which I haven't played yet).

I do still have some issues with the game, some of which are just personal preferences. First of all, it can be very punishing, in that one tiny timing mistake can totally screw you and leave you out of the running for the win. Second, it really seems like you have to choose which route you're going to go for early on in the game, sometimes even before you've had your first turn. If two of you choose the same route, you are both unlikely to win. Still, it's a great game, and plays very well with two players.

I like this game a lot.  There is a lot going on and a lot to think about as you plan your strategy.  You have to be able to roll with the punches and adjust as others take prime spots.  I also like the planning aspect that the gears give the game.

Ouch!  Just not my kind of game.  Five different resources with multiple ways of using them to score points, combined with temporal and positional elements. Wow.  The complexity is challenging, and if you get out of sync with the other players you can get hosed bad enough to take you out of the running quite early.

20 years ago I might have enjoyed this, but now I prefer simpler fare.

Brilliant design.  I enjoy worker placement and the pay-me-now-or-pay-me-later mechanism in this game is excellent.  A worker placement where getting more workers is NOT a primary objective?  Nice!
Of course, the theme is A+++ for me.

The only problem is that the game is prone to analysis paralysis, specially in the later rounds.

Very impressed with this on first play and looking forward to playing again.  Longish rules may make it appear more complicated than it really is; though they can be forgiven their length as they make pretty much everything crystal clear and the iconography on the board does a very good job of reminding you what each of the actions etc. do.  Getting past that first impression though it's clear that the relatively straightforward rules provide the basis for an involved game which delivers on the promise of the excellent presentation (an attractive Mayan setting featuring temples and - of course - the gears) and which really rewards thoughtfull play without causing too much brainburn.  First play was, perhaps inevitably, slowish but I can see it speeding up a lot in future now the basics have been absorbed - you should be able to plan ahead for most turns once the gears have turned; which should make a big difference next time.  

Altogether an excellent first impression, though I'm holding back on an even higher mark for now till that is conifmed - though I have every expectation that it will be and that my rating will increase.  

As an aside can I say how wonderful it is to be living in a world where we in Scotland can play a game designed by Italians (apologies if this is incorrect - I'm going by the names), produced by a Czech company, in an English language version co-produced by a US company and acquired in Germany (at Spiel).  That's an Internationalism I'm more than happy to sign up for.

RATING: 7
I've enjoyed this, but it took a hit once we figured out it was essentially all about Temples and Skulls. Against experienced players it's impossible to win without being significantly into Skulls. Temple points easily eclipse points for Monuments, buildings, or all other incidental points (Monuments particularly are fairly overpriced when compared to Skulls). Tech tends to be a sucker play, except for the Blue (Temple) tech and then possibly farming, depending on the game configuration (in a 3p game, a gummed-up farming wheel will make that tech more important). It's all right, but again, if you go into the game without knowing all this you can't be competitive.

One of my new favorite worker placement games.  Fresh mechanics that I haven't seen in the other WPs I've played.  The turning gears mechanic is great.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A cool twist on worker placement.  The gears look really chaotic at first blush, but they're really just a mechanism where you have to wait out your right on the gear until the gear rotates to the action you want.  You start at a crappy action on the gear, and as the gear rotates, the options get better and stronger.  So, the game is about when to jump off and get what you need.

Each gear also is "themed" toward specific parts of the game.  One gear is the harvesting gear, another is an economic gear, etc.  So, you need to place your limited workers carefully to ensure you get the stuff from one gear that you'll need to do stuff on another gear.  Neat timing problems to solve!

There are also several ways to score points, and strategies that revolve around all of them.  Good stuff!

Overall, a really solid worker placement game.  The only drawback is that the game is a bit of a learning curve off the bat, but everything is rather logical once you get rolling.

My favorite game, though I do not have the chance to play often. I think it's a gem, a one-of-a-kind game. One of the most complex games I played, though the mechanics are really simple. That's what makes this game so addicting. You got to think a lot, you can make your way to the victory with many ways, and once it's over, you just want to play again.
The material is also beautiful!

Update : Now, my wife and I play this game very often, so it got just better! We play the tribes expansion which makes the game easier but no less fun.

Really interesting worker placement game and I wish I was better at it! Players take turns placing workers on one of the gears that make up the board and, through careful planning, spend a turn picking up workers and activating actions. Since you can only place or retrieve workers during your turn the game definitely rewards players able to plan multiple turns ahead of time to maximize worker efficiency. The components are good but the board with the gears is the highlight. I wish there was a bit more variety in the setup, but the expansion definitely help in that regard. Still, a very game worth checking out for fans of thinky Euros!

A truly fantastic and innovative board game but I think its novelty has worn off as there are better worker placement out there I think. Place your workers onto the board and let them hang around on the cogs until they reach the item you need when you take them off - Planning and timing are very important here. Don't forget that you'll need to feed them every so often as well. 4 Plays.

A new favorite Euro game. We don't have too many games of this kind in our collection, but this one managed to get our attention because of the gears. The gears make for such a fresh experience in worker placement. Good thematic grounding for a Euro. My girlfriend and I very much enjoyed painting the gears, and love our custom Tzolk'in set. We have also picked up the expansion, Tribes & Prophecies. Excellent online version of the game can be found on boardgamearena.com.

Best pure worker-placement game I've tried. Never has the saying "you need think 3-4 moves ahead" been truer. A lot of different strategies to be used. I have won using a straightforward religion and crystal skull strategy, as well as using monuments to great effect. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
An ok game of choosing a path to victory early on (likely based on the cards you drew for initial bonuses and the available monuments) and then going for it.

During the game, like all worker placement games, you'll simply be figuring out what you need to do and what order you need to place your workers in in order to get what you want. The mild difference here is that you'll have to figure out on which turns to place your workers in order to minimize the number of turns where you'll be picking up workers. 

So, while the gears make it look very different than most worker placement games, the dynamic that you experience during play is pretty much identical because you are using exactly the same thought process in order to accomplish goals.

Seriously, just play Agricola.

RATING: 6
Managing all of the tricky timing elements of the wheels leads to some interesting and novel decisions. Having only 3 guys(to start) makes it tough to make efficient moves while having to move at least one guy per turn. So many turns you wish you could just pass, and that makes the whole game. 

Aside from the wheels, the rest of the game is just a mishmash of other worker placement games. Buy buildings, advance along tracks, feed your people, in game scorings, and big buildings for end game scoring. But for me, an innovative and cool game mechanic can be enough to pull me through a game, which it is here. 

I don't like that there are degenerate strategies - lowered to a 6 and will likely sell.

Tzolk’in is a great, great game! I own more than 200 games and meet with other guys too and play their games, so the fact I played this game 6 times in a January of relatively few plays speaks for itself! 

The wheel isn’t just a gimmick but an integral part of the gameplay and it is a quite interesting and unique element I think. There aren’t a whole lot of ways to score VPs (skulls wheel, god tracks, monuments), but each of my games has played out differently and been won in different ways. It does seem like the Chizchen Itza wheel is quite strong as you also move up on one of the god tracks, but if the other players know this you won’t be the only one to take advantage of this wheel, which suddenly makes the other wheels emptier and the other strategies easier to pursue and perhaps even more powerful… It all evens out in the end. 

The starting player rule is unlike many other games and is a brilliant move by the designers. The way you pass on the starting player marker if you are already the starting player, which you might want to do in order to get the food, is clever. But the biggest advantage of grabbing the starting player is (often) that you can advance the wheel two spaces and really mess up the plans of the other players! I also love the technology track which forms your strategy as does your two starting pieces which you chose in the beginning from four different tiles. The 5 wheels are very unique, and though you might focus on one or two, you’ll often need to place your workers on all of the wheels to succeed. 

BGG says the game is best with 4 players, but I really like the dummy players and think it’s perhaps even slightly better with 3. I had expected the game to produce a huge amount of AP because you might be able to plan several turns forward, but it hasn’t been the case in any of my games, so that’s just yet another plus.

I usually have a pretty good time working out the optimization puzzle of this game once I get going, but for some reason the concept of the wheel always makes me want to decline when people bring this game up as an option.

This game gets me every time, There's so many things I want to do but I have to choose, so agonizing. It definitely has stood the test of time with the many strategies to take and variables. Most decisions can cause some AP so prepare for lots of planning.  At least it's visually appealing with the gears and art. The game scales well with 2 or 4 and has good replay value from the buildings and starting tiles. New players will have a difficult time with planning. It's kind of a lot of information to take in with what actions do and how all the combinations merge together but the gameplay is rather straight forward. Definitely a game to check out and one of the best worker placement games out there.

The gears are neat in how you can "cook" your workers to do actions. The longer they bake, the better the actions.  There is definitely a lot to do and you don't have time to do even half of all there is to focus on.  There is very little 'blocking others' going on and every turn is really trying to time your payouts and placements to optimize your score.  The game also borrows heavily from Agricola in that you have to feed your workers at set points in the game.

I have to admit it--I have worker placement fatigue. It's a great mechanic, but so many new games start out with "OK... This is a worker placement game..."

Tzolkin is the exception--it adds something new that is legitimately interesting. The time element of leaving workers on the gears is a legit and fascinating element to the game. Now you are choosing where to place your guys, but also how long you let them hang around for maximum benefit. 

The rest is pretty familiar stuff. Gather resources and food, build stuff, shoot for endgame bonuses... That's not bad as it means the rest of the game fits like a comfortable shoe. I'm interested enough in this to possibly pick up a copy.

Lots going on and many decisions each turn, but overall I found it pretty easy to pick up for such a heavy weight game.

I want to play it again to try different strategies, which is always a good sign.

After playing Agricola and falling in love with it, I played Tzolk'in and after one play went out and purchased for my own collection. This game eliminates a lot of the "screwage" factor that is apparent in Agricola. While I love Agricola for this reason, I also love Tzolk'in because it allows you to be on the same wheel with a chance to get the same action that a previous player took. If you move forward too far, you can pay 1 corn per space you need to move back in order to take the appropriate action you were looking for. And, if you happen to get moved to the very last action space, you get a special aciton and can take any of the actions on that particular wheel. I love the fact there is one space on the board that is essentially a free for all. You can pay 1 corn to take any action, as long as it is not on the "skull" wheel (my apologies for not knowing the names of the various gears by heart). I did not win my first game, but came in a close second. As the gameplay was being described, I felt it was a bit much, almost like Caylus, but upon playing learned it was actually much simpler than it sounded. This is a fantastic medium weight game that is not for beginner board gamers, but certainly has a lot of replayability and features that will bring this hobbyist back for more!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Pretty Good and enjoyable!  The gears in the game are more than just eye-catching and gimmick.  The game mechanism presents the timing aspect very well.  Based upon the wheel moving for each round, the worker can increase its production value as long as it is staying on the wheel.  I also like the idea that "no action" is actually one of the actions.  
I believe if you like playing Caylus and Agricola, you will love this game.

The wheel mechanism in Tozlk is much better than "Labora" which only provides the supply of the products.  The gears in Tozlk carry the theme with Commerce, Religion, Architecture and Resources.  Although the theme carrying is a little bit loose, the ways to play on is very innovative.  The gears force players to think ahead and give blocking interactions to other players.  Good 2-3 players games!  

Let me think about the draw back of this game.... it's not easy to find enough food for people.  Also, it may be long waiting to get your crystal skull.  The mechanism may not be easy to pick up for non-gamers at the beginning.  If you lose at the first half of the game, it is hard to catch up.  

The components are top notch.  I give 9.5

*Yawn*...it's an OK worker placement game, I guess. It's seriously lacking in the 'fun' department, though...or even vaguely engaging. Just not for me. I also swear the gears/cogs on the board were turning quicker than those in the head of one of the players I played against (which probably didn't help my opinion of the game). 
The name of the game is accurate, too. I did indeed feel like sulking after playing it...

Great worker placement game with a unique spinning wheel mechanic, which moves placed workers around a circle of increasingly better rewards.

Rather rococo point-salad WP joint. The gears have an definite purpose but those who doth protest that they're not a gimmick doth protest too much. Plays quick but nudges the brain-burniness of the obvious progenitor Caylus from "ample" to "a tad annoying."

I guess I'm getting a little burned out on games that generate the fabled multiple paths to victory by piling one scoring mechanism on top of another, especially with the scoring mechanisms being so arbitrary-feeling, thematically speaking. ... I would play it again if it was in the cards, and I certainly owe it at least one more play for a fair shake, but this didn't do much for me.

Tzolkin is a great worker placement game. The mechanic is incredibly simple -- you either place games on a wheel or take them off. The wheel mechanic works very well. The problem with the game is that it's partially broken -- namely, the combination of tech rows two and three is too powerful. Tech rows enhance the power of each guy.

RATING: 10
A magnificent game with a magnificent mechanic. Some people have called the inclusion of gears a gimmick, but it's really not. Is the wheel in Ora et Labora gimmicky?

After two dozen gameplays, this game proves to have great replay value. Granted, I haven't won once, but I put that down due to my utter incompetence, not any shortcomings of the game (of which I can still detect none).

First game at Critical Mass Chermside with Hubertus, Cameron and James. I stumbled on a strategy that took me to a smashing victory on 114 points (2nd and 3rd were around 75). I maxed out the tech on the blue wheel then filled every slot (except one Hubertus got early). In the process I ended up on top in all three temples. I'm not sure if it will become a favourite - maybe it is a bit too abstract.

First play felt a bit kitchen-sinky. I get that it's a CGE game, and that's what you get from CGE. But I didn't quite like it as much as say Shipyard, where I felt like I had goals I was working toward. The core game play feels about as cube-pushy as can be. But the gear thing does work really well, and the idea of having things grow through time is a very good idea that I hope can be developed more. Update: Rating improved with additional play. Not forgiving with players of different skill levels though.

There wasn't a gamer who wasn't intruiged by Tzolk'in's gears when the game was presented at Spiel 2012, and I have a strong feeling that the title will hit the top-50 before 2012 is over and done with. A nicely hyped title, therefore.

I too was lured by the gears, but after playing have to come to the conclusion that what I imagined them to be was not what they actually were. I had thought that there would be a fierce battle over position with nasty rotation issues which would see you slide beyond a desired action. Having a lot of workers would make up for the deficiency. In practice, however, the amount of workers you have is quite limited, and you are allowed to execute actions on previous spaces of the wheel provided you pay. It turns a game-theoretical problem of playing other players into simply supplying enough money, and that is a much more 'tame' way of doing things. That said, the mechanism works well, and requires a good judge of timing just the same: the fact that money makes up for a lack of timing doesn't mean that it is [i]easy[/i] to obtain said money...

Unfortunately, the game the gears are connected to is rather run-of-the-mill. It's basically another resource conversion ensemble where resources obtained here become either points now, points in the long term, more abilities in the long term, etcetera. You get the idea: the core is really stock-standard, absolutely devoid of new tricks, and so forth. It works just fine, appears to be well-balanced too, but it's not as novel as the gears driving it; and the discrepancy is a little grating. In other words, the novelty of the game rests solely with said gears, and there I noticed, to my surprise, that after about 2/3rds of playing the game I was getting fed up with them already. It really is, quite literally this time, a mechanical exercise in optimising the production of resources. Again, I'm not saying it is easy to do it right, nor am I saying that matters are broken. I [i]am[/i] saying that the gears only provide a novel selection mechanism for the resources, and that it is hard to see what else the game has to offer. Since the various 'paths to victory' appear to be in order and at least sufficiently diverse, I concluded that the designers had at least given thought to this aspect, and have not let themselves carried away with their gimmick. That's a good thing. But still I was somewhat relieved that the game was done in the end: the gears don't rotate all that quick, and combined with the simplicity of the actions involved, it all becomes a bit of a drawn-out whole which gets older sooner than I wanted it to be.

I again repeat that the resource conversion game fed by the gears appears fine, and I'm not totally deaf to its Siren call. It reminds me, a little, of Amyitis, where such relatively simple paths exist too, but in a much smaller number, and without the sexy gears to drive it. The fact that you now [i]can[/i] purchase earlier actions works in the game's favour at this point. But in order to decide what wins out, my for the moment slight distaste for the gears, or the interest in the multitude of paths at the end, I'd have to play more. That's not going to be a problem since several people in my surroundings have succumbed to the Siren call and handed over their money; as for me, I'm going to listen a bit more before deciding.

Tzolk'in to gra, która nie przypadnie do gustu każdemu. Niektórzy mogą zniechęcić się po pierwszej rozgrywce, w której za bardzo nie wiemy gdzie i po co wysyłać robotników i kiedy ich zdejmować, jaki jest cel tych działań i jakie będą z tego korzyści. Trudności może również na początku sprawiać ikonografia na planszy i słownictwo z cywilizacji Majów. Nie należy jednak się zniechęcać, bo po 2-3 rozgrywkach wszystko się rozjaśnia i zaczyna się robić bardzo ciekawie. Gra ma w sobie duży potencjał i wyjątkową regrywalność. Mechanizm kół zębatych wymusza od nas ogromny wysiłek planowania i przewidywania przyszłych działań. Jeśli wszyscy prowadzą w każdym obszarze zrównoważony rozwój, nie ma zwycięskiej strategii. Przeszkadza tutaj jedynie zbyt krótka kołderka, osobiście mam wrażenie, że gra kończy się w połowie moich zamierzeń. Z drugiej strony, jest to zaletą, bo gra jest dynamiczna i trzeba maksymalnie wykorzystać swój czas.

I really like the theme and the gear mechanism, but the game beyond that falls flat.  All of the buildings (except for farms) just give you a one-time bonus.  You don't get a sense of development or engine-building compared to other popular Euros.  The T&P expansion provides some special abilities which really spices things up, but I would have like to see even more special abilities or buildings that provide ongoing benefits.

Incredible game! The amount of depth offered by the myriad of options made available in this game compounded by the advancing time element is just staggering. The layers of strategy possible here are sure to unfold beautifully over the course of many plays. Player interaction is excellent with the rotating cogs creating a changing environment of competition for limited resources. Like Terra Mystica, the god track adds a final dimension of complexity by providing still more goals beyond the already rich and diverse landscape. Add to all this wonderful artwork and pieces, and this has quickly become one of my favorite games. Oh, and it's a lot of fun to spin the Tzolk'in! Definitely will be seeing a lot of playtime.

What a cool, unique game.  Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar is a fantastic game design.  It's worker placement mechanic with gears that turn is quite unique.  With only a dozen plays under my belt, the replayability seems to be there.  I also like the way players affect each others play in the placement of their pieces.  I give the game an A+ for originality and similarly give it strong Kudos as a thinking game with simplistic, yet amazing game mechanics.  This is also a game players may wish to play 3 or 4 times to get the hang of it as it gets better and better the more plays you do. Tzolk'in is an amazing game and ranks in my top 20 euro style games of all time.

RATING: 8.5
Undoubtedly a visual stunner with its artwork, clever wheel mechanism and "crystal" skulls, Tzolk'in is also a very intriguing game with so much to pay attention to, it will leave your head spinning.

Each round players need to place OR take workers, but not both.  That small rule will cause immense anguish as you try to do all you want to at critical times.  Your workers can "ride" a wheel for only so long, and each space they turn to offers different benefits, so that timing is essential.  And will another player decide to advance the wheel twice in a turn, wrecking all your careful plans?

While I loved all the complexity, I do see some balance issues in the game that are of a concern, but not enough to ruin the overall fun.  Definitely a game worth exploring for all the Euro fans out there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
In my opinion, Tzolk'in is a complex, well-balanced board game that makes for a fun and engaging few hours every time. The gears are really cool and especially when combined with the expansions, can accommodate different play styles each time you give it a whirl. Definitely recommend if you like complex games with little-to-no luck involved and don't mind a number of different pieces/mechanics to keep track of.

The nature / valuation of time in this game is really interesting; I feel like I'm just beginning to get a handle on it after 3-4 plays.

I wonder what resource build is? I wonder if this game is too solvable with two players? Right now this thing is definitely not solved by us. What house rule could you come up with for a problem like this? Play two colors as in a four person game and the lowest score is the one that counts? There is too much good here to throw it away. 

What if you did that but also added tribes, as I do have the expansion? That might be interesting. Or add prophecies too? Much to explore. Probably plenty of value for my gaming buck. Probably a solution that we like enough. F the haters and their elitism. As in forget them, or do I lie? (Horrible to play with those type, and they are not our type anyway).

There is a good, a value in this game, that has not been equaled or surpassed, for the kind that it is, in my collection so far. I will fight for it.

Juego de gestión de recursos bastante correcto. Todo el rollo de las ruedas es más por estética/gancho comercial que por propia jugabilidad, pero le da cierto encanto. Completamente independiente del idioma, y con una rejugabilidad aceptable, pero no tiene demasiadas opciones sobre como llegar a la victoria, la cual cosa puede hacer que algunas partidas se conviertan en una carrera para ver que jugador consigue antes determinada "cosa".

Worker placement with time management (means if you want some action, you need to select that action couple turns ahead). It's nice twist to worker placement, though I'm having a hard time not to perceive this as JA(S)E.

RATING: 9
In short, Tozlk'in represents the pinnacle of the resource-conversion worker placement genre. Far from being just a visually appealing gimmick, the rotating gears constitute a giant puzzle to solve and provide a pretty unique additional dimension in the form of time management. Throw in an attractive theme, simple rules, multiple viable strategies, almost no luck involved and (expansion alert!) variable powers and goals, and the result is a brain-burning gem asking you to constantly plan several turns in advance. It could probably use some more player interaction, but hell I just love it.

This is my favorite worker placement game! It is a very impressively designed game. I love the thrill you get when you time all of your workers such that you can take them all off the gears in one big, amazing super-move,

I think it plays best with 3 players. The gears are a little too crowded with 4 players, making it more difficult to get on the gears you need to get on, which makes taking the first-player spot a lot more important.

Worker placement done right.  

On their turn, players can either choose to place workers or remove them to take actions. That measure of simplicity lessens the AP-factor.  

I haven't played it enough to know if there are broken strategies (you'll find murmurings in the strategy forums), but god I hope there aren't any. This game is just too well-designed and too pretty to look at for it to suffer from an OP strategy.

Woah, finally managed to play this one. Moving these gears is so fun and satisfying! I like seeing the progress, how my workers get more and more efficient as the time goes on. Tzolkin really wants you to plan ahead - you must have a very careful plan for subsequent turns and see everything in your head in order to create a powerful synergy between the possible action in one turn. Therefore don't expect high scores in your first play. The very simple main mechanism - either put workers onto the board or take them off, never combine these two - works very well. Later in the game very powerful combos emerge when you take off 4 or 5 workers and do various stuff! Aside from that time system actions are rather typical euroish, get resources, move on the technology/temple track, trade, construct buildings and monuments that give you additional options, also for scoring. There is feeding your workers but it's not overly restrictive and it's easy to fulfill. Game length is ideal - not too short, not too long, you'll have time to do what you want. You only need to wait, wait, wait... and plan carefully. This game punishes for mistakes(damn, my worker went one space too far, damn, I cannot combine these two actions as I'd like and so on...) but is very rewarding when you succeed at merging your actions together efficiently. There's little player interaction - not too much blocking despite it's working placement. Sometimes it happens, but in most cases accidentally and not on purpose. I don't mind that as there's already much to do and analyse! Looking forward to play again.

RATING: 9.5
2-4 players, 90-120 minutes, medium heavy, worker placement

The game looks great, has a nice theme and adds something to the worker-placement genre through the introduction of the cart wheel which turns all the other wheels, so you have to pay attention when you place and take off your meeples. 

As you're only allowed to either place or take off meeples in your turn, timing is probably more important here than in any other game I know. 
An additional factor too add some complexity is the starting player space. When you claim this you receive all the food (corn) which was placed there in previous turns, but also you have the opportunity to turn the wheels twice instead of once, which can seriously mess with other players plans.

Every cart wheel has it's own purpose: food and wood, resources, development and buildings, trade and workers and lastly offerings to the gods. Basically, you need everything and can't neglect any wheel, but the number of workers is very limited and like I said, you can only put workers on one or more wheels or take them off. As the longer they remain on the wheel, the better the reward, so you'd like to keep all of them on as long as possible, which you can't. This part is soooo hard to master, and I'm still learning with every game.

To summarize, this game is highly recommended and has been in my top 10 for a couple of years now.

Can't wait to play again :)

Tzolk'in is great game if you like puzzling out future moves.  Though nothing like Maccao, I like both for this reason.
My only caution is that there are a lot of detailed rules.  It is not a game where you can get a general idea and figure out the rest as you go.

Resources and food are tight, actions are tight, difficult to build the monuments (end-game scoring tiles). Gears work well in the game and are NOT just a gimmick as some are claiming. 

Edit: after five plays, I'm much less excited to play this. Still a decent game, but I don't ever see myself recommending it. Several other worker placement games that are better. My main frustration is being forced to pursue crystal skulls if you want to stand a chance at winning. There should be other viable alternatives.

Pros: Appears to have a wealth of strategies and tactical choices to choose from. Great board and tile components. Mayan theme makes sense with the wheel timer.

Cons: Doesn't quite scale with several components in the expansion.

This is probably my favourite worker placement game, the way the gears work, as well as the way that blocking spaces can occasionally allow your opponent to jump start their strategy makes for a very engaging and interactive experience.  The sheer magnitude of options means you can try out a variety of different strategies, and allows for clever and interesting plays.  I've never felt bored playing Tzol'kin.

Played with the expansion, which is also quite nice, and adds a little bit of direction at the start of the game, which actually makes the game a bit more accessible without removing complexity.

One of the Very Great games out there. Oh so many paths to victory, so many ways to hinder your opponents.

Superbly well thought out game that flows quickly once everyone knows how it's done. Although by the end of explaining the rules the word 'corn' will have lost all meaning in those learning it.

Terrific.

I really enjoyed playing this game and had it on my wish list for a long time. There is a lot to think about when placing workers - do you want to pay more for a spot at a space and how long are you willing to let the worker wait before collecting your goods? I found the time element, having a worker occupied on the gears, another constraint that you must constantly deal with. After a year since my play and the game never rising up to get purchased, I dropped my initial rating that this was an 8 and put it at a 7. It's one I'll play if it's the right time but I'm not seeking out plays or even compelled to buy it.

[29 June 2017] -  7.25 (2 plays)
Finally played this again with 4 people. I like the tight board and the additional dimension of time that is added with the gears. A very solid worker placement game that has more to think about than just getting to a spot first. I still find it hard to get the efficiency engine going and thinking that's just me not having my timing down on when I want to take the first player marker so I get better deals on placement spots. The one flaw to this game may be that it's dry. Most of the time it's just about value of spots on the board and converting resources. The theme is cool but doesn't really add to the game play and it could just as well be abstract symbols.

When I first saw the game set up on a table I was ecstatic. Unfortunately all the buzz and all the prettiness harmed it for me. The experience I had was not the best. I don't know if it was the group's fault, or if we played a rule wrong, but I never played Tzolk'in again.

One of the most brilliant game designs I've ever seen.  Tough and balanced, yet very rewarding when your plans all come together.

This is my review after having played 6 two player games and 1 4 player game.

The good

- Fun, challenging, strategic and hard to master.

- Nice variation to worker placement, even though it is quite similar to Caylus.

- With 2 players it plays rather quickly (less than 1.5 hours).With 4 however it is more like 2.5 to 3 hours, which I find longish.

- Equally good with 2 to 4 players. The game scales very well because there is so little interaction.

- Low downtime because it is possible to think ahead.

- Quick to set up and clean up.

- There is almost no bookkeeping to be done during the game, thanks to the gears.

- The rules are not too complex, not too fiddly and mostly intuïtive.

- The crystal skulls look nice.

- Good rulebook and good in-game documentation.


The bad

- Multi-player solitaire. There is very little interaction between the players (unlike Caylus, Agricola and Le Havre, where you constantly need to think about what the other players will do).

- The luck factor is low but existent. It stems from the random 4 tiles every player draws at the beginning of the game, the random selection of the start player, the random replenishment of the buildings and the random replacements of the buildings in the second era. You can get lucky if a building you can really use comes available at the right time, or with good start tiles.

- The cogwheels look very uninspiring (although you can make them look absolutely stunning if you are willing to spend time and money on a paint job), and the board is not that beautiful either. Apart from the crystal skulls, there are only cubes 'n discs

- The cogwheels were bent in my copy, so I had to spend 2 hours of boiling and bending to flatten them.

- The theme is rather shallow (but not totally abstract either).


Conclusion: the total lack of player interaction and existing luck factor keep me from giving this game the highest rating.

RATING: 7
The innovation here is the timing of your actions. You place a meeple onto a wheel and then decide how many cranks of the wheel to permit before you take an action by removing the meeple. The actions get better the longer you wait, but you may not be able to hold out for long with your likely mounting need for resources and currency.

The rest of the game is fairly conventional worker placement, with the usual types of decisions and with the usual angst created by your wanting to do far more than you're able to.

What is going on in this game? 
Its been a while since I've played, but I remember everyone having no idea how to plan anything out or how to develop a plan beyond what the game seemed to be feeding each player. 
Personally, I felt the gears were really gimmicky, even if they were probably the best way to do what this game is trying.

At it's core, Tzolk'in is a rather conventional worker placement game with your typical resource allocation and conversion actions. It's the gears that make this one interesting by adding time as another resource that needs to be managed.

I'm far from being good at Tzolk'in but I'm looking forward to exploring it more and becoming better in timing my actions. It is just plain fun to play and I'm giving it two thumbs up.

I like the mechanisms in this one, the idea of planning ahead and getting actions in the future is a great one.  But the theme is paper thin.  It's a well designed, and excellent game, that has the feeling of never having enough resources (especially corn) but in the end, it feels like a spreadsheet.  If the theme was better integrated, this could be a 9 or a 10.

This rating could go up after more plays, because I really enjoyed some of the interesting decisions and short term look-ahead.  Setting yourself up on a wheel is really gratifying, especially when things sing.  And when you screw up, performing triage on your plans is kind of fun, too.

The central gear mechanism is brilliant.  It works perfectly.  It even has a natural way of winding down at the end of the game to reduce AP.  But there are a bunch of other rules with exceptions and sub-mechanics taken from other games that are all smashed together in a very un-thematic way.  It took us an unpleasant 60 minutes to learn the game, and the person teaching was doing a great job.  That's too long.  1 hour to learn the game, and 2 hours playing it.  That's not a good ratio of pain to fun.

I'm not a big fan of worker placement games but this one manages to be both interesting and rather fun. 

What you are trying to achieve is nothing different to any  number of other games, getting VP's by accumulating resources with which to build things and ascending various victory tracks,  but the cogs add a timing element to the 'place and return' worker action selection which does add a very nice dynamic. You are almost trying to spring timed combos of actions to most efficiently use the number of limited turns. 

Lot's to think about although what you can do each turn is very simple - either place worker(s) or activate worker(s).

It also scales well - played with 2, 3, 4 and 5 (with the expansion) and all work well.

After one play I was pretty sure this was a game I wasn't going to like.

After 7 plays I now consider Tzolk'in to be a very good medium-heavy Euro which I enjoy playing.

The reasons I didn't originally think this would be my kind of game was it's relative complexity, length of play especially with several newbies, possibility of analysis paralysis, and the relatively themeless nature of the game.

Now, with more expert players, a better understanding of the mechanics, strategies, and timing I think this game is just great.

One of the few games where my initial impression was wrong.

I like this game! The gears make it special! The idea of leaving your workers out and collecting more/better resources, reaping higher benefits...ingenious, I'd say.

Worker placement....gears that move...lots of different actions.  Awesome.  I could easily see this go up to a 9.  I think I might have to buy it.

One of my favorite things about the game is the semi-random start.  I really like the idea where you are dealt 4 tiles, you pick 2 to start.  And all the tiles give different combinations of things.  It's a good way to encourage different strategies.  I think this will have a good shelf life.

I don't like to bump many euro's to 9 or higher, but this one is just a lot of fun to play.  It breaks the traditional worker placement model and presents different ways to victory.  More workers isn't necessarily the way to go.  Gotta bump it from 8 to 9.

Very good euro. The gear mechanism is not a gimmick it really has a central role in the mechanics of the game. It is quite interesting to see a worker placement where the workers move over time.

RATING: 8
Players are Mayans, acquiring resources and trying to turn them into victory points, using an interesting timing mechanism.  Players on their turn have two options, either place workers onto the game board, and pay corn for the placement.  Alternatively, they can retrieve workers off the game board, earning the actions from the retrieved pieces.  Simple!  Not so fast... the workers are placed onto one of five "cogs", each geared to a central cog, which controls the five action cogs.  At the end of each round of player turns, the central cog advances a notch, moving the five action cogs (and their workers) up a space, onto a more lucrative action.  The idea is to wait for the pawns to reach the action you want on the five cogs, and then retrieve your workers.  

The five cogs each have a different theme - one earns wood and corn, another more general resources, one is dedicated to receiving crystal skulls for favour of the gods, and so on.  There are also technology trees to advance along, buildings to construct, both of which allow you to become more efficient.  There are also three god tracks to climb, for victory points and more resource rewards.

Simple game to play, but wow, very deep in terms of planning and executing the plan efficiently.  The game looks amazing - lovely art, glossy laminated board (to protect it from the moving cogs, I assume), and really good resource management game play.  CGE does it again - stunning game.

Gorgeous game and probably better than I give it credit for. I am an avowed hater of worker-placement games, but I admit that this one is the best of the bunch thus far.

There are so many opportunities to place people in time that you are rarely ever blocked out of a place. If the free space is blocked, you pay up and are compensated by being advanced ahead of the free space.

The number of scoring methods are staggering, and many plays will be required to wrap my head around the paths to getting ahead. Innovative!

Workerplacement game. Place workers on 5 wheels that turn each round and give more advanced options. Optimize placement and pickup times for better effect.

Extreamely fine mechanism that works for the theme too. Something totally different.

Also seems like theres very many different approaches to placement which makes game very good in genre of worker placement.

very very good - i need more plays to decide on a rating but i feel like based on more time w/ the game it could swing between a 9 and a 7, depending on the depth of strategy. main fear is that the 6-worker rush strategy is too oppressive and takes away from the fun of the game, but the rotating board is a joy to play with and it's very tough to grasp

RATING: 10
I resisted buying this for some time, but I was a dummy.  I think this game may be the pinnacle of the worker placement genre for me.  It has many things I enjoy and nothing I don't:

* Variable starting resources that you can select based on initial board setup
* Variable in-game goals (even more so when you add in the expansion)
* Trade-off between cashing in now and waiting.
* Quick turns
* Game lasts long enough to bring plans to fruition, or even weather a mistake to tow (but not too long!)
* Useful technology advancement
* Area majority competition on the temples
* Both specialization and diversification appear to be viable strategies if you remain focused on your objectives
* Lots of things to do, lots of ways to do them, but only a few things give points
* The gears eliminate a lot of error-prone manipulation of pieces
* The expansion makes the game even more dynamic in very interesting ways
* Corn

My rating takes the excellent expansion into account.  Tribes & Prophecies injects a host of dynamic elements into the game, a rare accomplishment for games in this genre.  I'd have to shave off a point without the expansion.

I am tempted to give this game + expansion a 10, but I can't yet bring myself to do so with a cube-trading game, no matter how excellent.  However, I will easily call this game best-in-class (although Carson City might give it a run for its money after I've played that game some more).

UPDATE 2017:  Played this again after 3 years. I can't believe I haven't played this for that long.  It's still fantastic, and with the expansion, it is in fact a 10, even with just two players.

A very analytical worker-placement game with a fair amount of blocking/screwage.   The main attraction are the plastic gears which work pretty well to advance workers along time tracks.   The game is a chore to teach because so many spaces and buildings have to be explained.   With AP players this would be brutal, especially in the mid-game.    It features three prestige tracks, which is a mechanism that I'm not too fond of (same issue I have with Terra Mystica).  It's such an abstract form of competition.   The Mayan flavor comes through pretty well here although I'd hesitate to call the game thematic.   The gears beg to be painted, and some folks have done a gorgeous job of that, but you have to wonder if the game will be played enough to justify it.   If you like very analytical, "thinky" competition, this game could be a winner for you.

Tzolkin introduces some nifty new ideas with its trademark gears, but is otherwise not that exciting.  There's nothing wrong with the game, it's just another mid-heavy action-management resource-conversion game, and there's only so many of those I can take in an evening.  

I still need to play it a couple more times to get the hang of things.  Each time I try to get ahead of the curve, but it feels like the game ends a few turns before I can do the stuff I need to.  
I like the usual different paths to victory, but don't feel like they're necessarily balanced.  Some of them are going to be incentivized because the corresponding wonder is in the game at the start, so you can plan for that.  But while most of the wonders only give you points for your progress in a given area, some of them count things done by all players, meaning that there's little reason to do more than dabble in those areas.
I really dislike the fact that someone can take start player and arbitrarily accelerate the game, screwing with everyone else's plans & decision-making.  There's few enough turns in the game already without reducing that number by 4 if everyone spins the wheel once.

I think this is a unique game and thus worth owning for everyone's collection. The gears are something new (not entirely new as 01 also uses gear) and innovative in it's own way. 

[b]Update (18th Sept 2013)[/b]: After 10 recorded palys, I'm starting to think that this game boils down to who's best on the three god temple tracks. Simply ignoring this track will caused major lack in point scoring. The VPs you get from these temple tracks are huge to a point that I going all out here will win you the game. Going high and scoring the bonus from the temples is much superior than players who own plenty of buildings, monuments and high on the tech track. You CAN 100% ignore the tech track, going up high on the temple track and win the game with no problem. Because of this, I'm somewhat think this game's only focused is at the temples, thus making it less fun. [b]Update[/b]: Now I honestly think that the expansion fixes this problem as it shifts your focus on other areas to avoid the prophesy penalties in the expansion.

** Note to all owners, you MUST paint your Tzolk'in gears **

Juegazo, muy muy bueno, debes planificar un turno hacia adelante y lo de dejar trabajadores en la rueda y esperar dividendos futuros es muy entretenido, tiene la dosis de tension que tanto me gusta y mucha estrategia, lo unico malo es que es de esos juegos que funcionan muy bien con un numero de jugadores (4) y que flaquean mucho con otro.

A game I've heard can get pretty deep and layered. But for our casual game group we've had a great time with whatever strategies we've developed.

A great worker placement game with a unqiue play style based on a wheel that moves every round ticking time away.

It seems so simple either you're moving your workers on the wheels or taking them off, but the timing as to when and how many is what can make this game so much fun (and can get to that way deeper and layered ways can be played).

Can feel pretty punishing always being under the knife trying to feed your workers in time. But that also adds to the excitement.

Good game.

RATING: 8.45
One the best worker placement games I had a chance to play. It's probably because of ingenious gear mechanics representing Mayan calendar. Huge wheel in the middle of the board is rotated by one step at he end of every round which causes 5 other smaller gears to rotate together with it, advancing workers placed there to better action spaces. The more your worker waits on the gear, the better the benefit he will get. On first glace it seems complicated but it really is simple to medium one. Still it offers a lot of fun, especially since I love worker placement, resource management Euro games.
Also, I am looking forward to playing it with Tribes and Prophecies expansion.

Nos megvolt az idei (2012) esseni újdonságok slágerének (legalábbis ez áll a legelőkelőbb helyen a BGG-n köztük) számító játék kipróbálása.
A játékról:
A tábla és az elemek gyönyörűek.
A játék folyamatos tervezést igényel, konfrontáció -tényleges konfrontáció- kevés van benne: ugyan nyilván előbb teszel 1-1- fogaskerékre és ezzel elveszed a lehetőséget mástól, de mivel azért többnyire látható-sejthető ki merre akar elmozdulni, mit tervez (persze ebben lehet tévedni), ezért nem annyira meglepetés többnyire ha kilöknek, elveszik a helyet, elemet.
A fogaskerekek zseniálisak, és nagyon jól kell látni, h mi h merre fog majd jönni. De jól is látható.
A többiek szerint több stratégia is jól működik, az biztos, h a többszöri játék nagy előny az átlátásban: csúnyán levertek, gyakorlatilag esélyem se volt.
Én úgy látom -igaz 1 játék alapján- h a monumentek, a nagy művek igen erősek, egy olyan megszerzése valszeg kell a győzelemhez (de ezt a játékostársak cáfolták, nyert már úgy vki, h nem volt ilyenje. hm, lehet, de szerintem jó eséllyel kell hozzá, persze nem feltétel, de ha jól jönnek hozzá a cuccok, érdemes belevágni, főként 1-2 sok pontosra ráfeküdni. Persze a merev ragaszkodás nem cél, sőt ...). Nagyon fontos, és ezért előny a több játék, h a kezdeti vagyonodból mit lehet kihozni, mire-merre érdemes elindulni, ezt jól kell érezni.
Én ugyebár Caylus fan vagyok, az a top one, még mindig.
Nos ahhoz hasonlítva: erősen közelíti, talán el is éri azt a szintet nálam, de ez több játék alapján fog kiderülni.
Pl, h mennyire lehet stratégiát váltani út közben, mennyire vannak menekülő utak, ha látod más is afelé megy, és nem fogod elérni a terved.
Azt hiszem ennek a játéknak van esélye megszorítani, még ha nem is dönti le a csúcsról a nagy kedvencem.
A kerekek nagyon jól összerakottak, nagyon jól tervezhetőek, ha elsiklasz vmi felett, nincs baj -csak idő persze, egyrészt a kerék végén bmelyik visszább lévőt, másrészt pénzért (kukoricáért) is lehet visszább lévő fogaskereket használni. A kerekeken bár nyilvánvalóan egyre erősebb dolgok vannak, de ez nem feltétlen azt jelenti, h a legerősebb megszerzése a legjobb. Sőt. Gyakran egy olcsóbb jó ütemű "elvétele" többet ér...
A munkások is jól kitaláltak: vagy felteszel vagy le, de vmelyiket kötelező...épp ezért nem feltétlen nyerő a sok munkás, bár van haszna, és nyilván az is egy jó stratégia, de kevés munkás hatásos-jó felhasználása, keveset de sokszor markol legalább olyan jónak tűnik.
az élelmezést nem szent grál,azaz simán lehet hagyni, h 1-1 alkalommal 1 v 2 főt ne etess meg, ugyan mínusz pont, de lehet, h ezzel több pontot szerzel. Ez különösen a játék utolsó értékelő körére igaz. (egy nem etetés -3 pont cserébe mondjuk veszel egy "nagy mű" lapkát, ami meg ad pl. 15 pontot....)
A szabály világos, és egyértelmű nagy kérdések nem merültek fel benne első olvasatra, majd ha lefordítom teljesen kiderül, h tényleg így  van-e

My initial experience with this game was also played with the Tribes & Prophecies expansion, so it's hard for me to comment on the base game.

That being said, I can imagine enjoying the game much more without the two elements this expansion brings to it, but I'm not sure by how much more.  I found the prophecies to be extremely punishing to those already struggling and solely responsible for creating a runaway leader.  The tribes were a nice touch in terms of making everyone's turn unique.

Our game also had a slight case of AP at the table, which didn't help perception, but I suppose a little can be expected with a game that has so many options available and not necessarily any of the outcomes playing out as expected.

At any rate, the game is a solid worker placement game and the gears are a unique mechanic, but while I am more than happy to play someone else's copy, I don't believe this or the base game will enter my collection any time soon, despite the novelty of the board.

Haven't played this one enough to have a good feel for the strategy.  At it's heart, Tzolk'in is a worker placement game--the main innovation is (obviously) the gears.  Despite how it might look, the gears aren't just a gimmick--they really influence the strategy and gameplay.  Instead of placing workers where you want them to be now, you need to figure out where they will be when you want to take them off the board--in several turns.  Very eager to play this one a few more times.

I literally never get tired of playing this game. I love worker placement games, and this one is my favorite of the genre. I love how is starts out with the choice between four basic strategies, and as the game evolves, the strategic choices branch from there.

In my experience, best with three players (even with the expansion, which allows up to five).

Behold!  A crystal skull!

I'm not very good at it, even after sumpteen or twenty something plays, but man do I love it.  Pretty simple game to play - assign workers or use workers, but the layers spread on top of that give the game a great strategic flavor.  The monument tiles are going to give you an idea of what strategy you want to pursue, and then it's up to you to manipulate the gears, race up the temple tracks, make your technology more powerful, and build buildings in order to get that monument built and score tons of points in the process.  I also really love how prevalent corn is in the game.  It really enhances the theme.  Love this game!  There's really no need for me to play other games when I have Tzolk'in!  It's completely captured my brain.

room to go up or down, some AP issues are likely due to a very diverse resource production and scoring mechanisms. now if the time drops rating will go up a point maybe, if it doesn't then will drop to a 5ish.

Tzolk'in actually reminded me a bit of Trajan. I think the main reason is that both games have a very thought provoking central game mechanism. One thing I thought Tzolk'in handled really well compared to other worker placement games is more workers does not equal more win. If you don't have the means of supporting extra people, they are not worth your investment. This could be argued for Agricola and other games as well, but in Tzolkin not only do you have to feed your people at regular intervals, but just doing the normal worker placement thing will also likely cost you food. This game also seems to have decent variety since each player will have asymmetrical starting resources and not every monument will be used every game. Overall, I thought it was pretty good and look forward to future plays.

Great game with a cool interlocking clock system.  It may seem like a gimmick but it really is done well and gives this game a unique feel from other worker placement games while introducing an interesting balance/mechanics of how to interact with the wheels/gears.  It is a very deep and great game but one you want to play a lot in order to really get the most of as the strategies and counter strategies are complex and intricate.  You really need to plan out what you want to do to do well.  This is not a game to play once in a blue moon (you'll be trying to figure out the strategies etc all over again) but very rewarding the more you play it and still fun the first time you do.

Cool mechanics, great theme and gorgeous looks, is there enough superlatives. Then to the complaints: game board is too glossy, it's sometimes troublesome to look it in some lighting. Maybe there are some little balance issues as well, I think that some monuments are too strong against others and some food buildings can give too much advantage when someone doesn't have to feed the workers while the other players are struggling to get those bastards fed. But it doesn't ruin the game too much, I still love this game although my timings suck everytime... it needs many more plays.

RATING: 8
The rotation of the worker gears, really separates this from the crowd, and despite the plethora of worker placement games on the market, this one has held onto its high position, and for good reason. Calculating how to place and pull the optimal number of workers each turn, and establishing a good rhythm is crucial to victory, but not easily mastered. There seem to be about three dominant strategies to utilize and combat, but mastery is not easily attained. Whether a player goes big on corn, building, or theology, it'll take a few plays to iron out the kinks, and this will lure the optimizers of the world, myself included, into several plays. Perhaps it is my Puerto Rico bias leaking through, but the Big Corn strategy is wicked fun.

[1 play] Thought things were going pretty badly and tied for victory, so maybe not. Not sure what I think of this game. Seems so simple in one way--only two possible things to do on your turn, put guys on the wheels or take them off--but can definitely bring on AP. In the beginning I didn't go hard enough for food, and in the end I found that I couldn't accomplish the goals I had hoped for because I hadn't started guys on the right wheels early enough.  How your rhythm interacts with others is extremely consequential. 

This game is hard to teach because there are so many parts and so much iconography.  I think a couple plays would give an advantage just in being familiar with all your options and remembering what everything is. I wouldn't mind playing this again (preferably sooner rather than later), but not sure what my final verdict will be.

Pretty fun - seems really daunting on first play because of all the symbols, but it all works together pretty smoothly and becomes, to me, something like a much more fun and understandable version of Stone Age.  That said, the gears seem like they would have been a good mechanism for brutally punishing other players (grinding them into gears and killing their worker or at least making them have to do something bad), but the amount of messing with others here is sadly small.  It ends up as a mere efficiency engine builder, but at least a good one with a lot of paths to victory.

Set in a Mayan civilization, this is a farming oriented worker placement game where you co-ordinate many actions among an ingenious system of various rotating gears in order to score the most points by game end. 

Everything looks really overwhelming at first and it has a lot of moving parts (literally!) but in essence it's really easy to understand. On your turn you either place workers or collect them and any goods they have accumulated  on the spot where they currently stand. The longer you leave them out working for you the more productive they will be, but you are constrained by a limited workforce in the beginning and you need to maximise your actions as you only have a 28 day timespan to complete the game. The rulebook was easier to follow than I expected, the components are well done and the crystal skulls are awesome!

I bought the game a couple of years ago because there's nothing else quite like it (gears in a board game!) and also because of recommendations, but it remained unplayed because it looked so complicated. Since then I've come to realise that I don't really like worker placement games and having finally played this month I find that Tzolk'in is the antithesis of the ones that I [i]do[/i] like. While it is interesting, it lacks direction so whenever you play you decide whether you're going for a skull placing/corn denial/resource grabbing/temple racing/building & monument strategy and see how it shakes out in the end and the onus is on you to make the most points rather than having to work towards something specific. It's perfect information which promotes cutthroat tactics which I can't stand (“Oh you're low on corn and a food day is coming up? Oh well...then I'll just use every worker to block all of the spaces on the agriculture wheel and take the first player spot just for insurance”) :yuk: For both of those reasons above it's easy for somebody who has mapped out the most efficient way every time to do exactly the same thing for the win rather than vary their strategies. Also, while it uses a very clever way of assigning dummy workers to take up WP spots on the gears in a 2 player game, having played the game at the 3 player count those placements look unnatural and illogical now. Rewards long term planning strategies which is not my forte as I prefer to be a tactical player. My worker placement games of choice remain Walnut Grove and Yedo.

The unique gear system with the incredibly detailed central board, the fact that painting the entire system of gears was my very first painting project, and the bonus of being Pic of the Week (Geek Weekly #167) as a result of that painting are the only real reasons this is a keeper in my collection. Maybe I'll come to appreciate it more somewhere in the future way down the road, but as it stands at present I could take it or leave it.

I really enjoy everything this game has to offer but I never manage to do well. 
The planning ahead is something that doesn't seem to work for me with the spinning wheels.
In essence the actions are very fast and simple. You either take a pawn or place one or more pawns on the wheel.
When you take a pawn you perform the depicted action and that's basicaly it.
Even after some major shameful defeats I would still love to play it again and have it in my collection.

The aging worker mechanism on the gears is more than a gimmick and is a real consideration from turn to turn. There’s a rhythm to placing some but not all your workers on the gears that is fun to manage. You can’t do all the tech trees so you’ve got to pick your investment(s) carefully or else you’ll flounder. All in all, the game offers a unique worker placement experience. I highly recommend the expansion for the extra elements of starting powers and end of age punishments/rewards.

2012 Secret Santa.

Very interesting. Appealing graphics. Some excellent variations on familiar mechanics. Lots of fun decisions. I especially like the degree of choice of starting resources, a little touch which sets the game off on the right foot for me. Multiple strategies available, certainly more than meet the eye; Chichen Itza, Maximum Corn, Monuments, and Temple dominance.

Very tense with 4 players, almost unpleasantly so. An intense experience, not unlike Twilight Struggle. Competition for actions can be brutal, especially when Food Day approaches. Actions have to be chosen well in advance and contingencies put in place in case they are unavailable.

Winning against competent opposition requires a single minded pursuit of a strategy chosen at the very beginning of the game.  

Provisionally rating this an 8. Also plays well with 2.

I love, love, love:
- the twist on worker placement
- the pressure of planning ahead perfectly
- the multiple strategy paths
- the artwork
- the "paintability" of the gears
- that there is replayability from exploring strategies
- the asymmetric start to the game
- that the theme does come through due to the solid artwork and visual design of the game

I dislike:
- that there seems to be one or two dominant strategies that are hard to beat (see BGA's Expert players)...
- the thinness of some of the cardboard components--it works, but it's so weird

Final verdict: While there isn't much replayability because of only the monuments, buildings, and starting resources varying every game, there is a lot because of the variety of strategies offered. It's a game I can get better at with repeated play and one that can really reward exploring new strategies. And while the gears mechanism can certainly have another theme pasted over it, the design and artwork of the board being so 100% focused does sell me the sense of theme that the game is going for. I absolutely enjoy the whole puzzle that this game offers.

Fun worker placement game that has an interesting element of programming actions/timing. Each turn you either place 1 or more meeples or remove one or more meeples from several wheels that provide greater benefits the longer you are on them. You may not pass. If you have no meeples to place then you must remove at least one. When you remove a meeple, then you get the reward it occupies on the wheel. Then THE GEAR TURNS and all the wheels rotate a space. 

So, it's vital that you plan your moves such that you have the resource you need from one wheel, at the time when you will be removing your worker from a wheel that requires that resource to purchase something. But oh no, you didn't allocate your workers correctly and now you have to remove one early before you have the resource you need. Or shoot, you want to remain on the wheel for science (because you're STEM minded), but you need to feed your people. (Every quarter you have to feed your people, and there are some mid game scoring/resource collection moments as well).

Additional tension is added by resources becoming scarcer as the game goes on.  There's a LOT going on. But everybody had fun, and it felt like there were many roads to success.

Did I mention you get to turn a gear each round that turns all the wheels?  Okay, I know it's wrong to love a game because you get to turn a gear . . . but oooooh!

I've heard that some people consider the game broken because one of the wheels is superior.  So far, when we've played with the max players, the fight for resources has kept anyone from dominating that way (which I won't spoil here -- google it yourself). I really like this game a lot.

One complaint, some of the iconography is either small or difficult to decipher, and the middle wheel isn't painted (minor issues).

There gears are such an innovative concept that proves itself to be the exact opposite of a gimmick. It plays so well and you have to make so many interesting choices, adjusting your long-term strategy of buying buildings and monuments according to the tactical reactions necessary with getting blocked on the wheels. Can't wait to try the expansion, which I also own.

I want to like this game, but it's got some pretty heavy issues: it's way too long, and the wheels feel pretty unbalanced (whoever controls the yellow wheel usually controls the game). It's also pretty hard to come back when you're behind - and, in a long game, that's a pretty big issue.

Tzolk'in is a rather complex worker-placement game that requires thinking ahead based on how the gears turn.  There are a lot of resources to keep track of a lot of side tracts that require balancing and planning for these resources. Now add in the multiple rather opaque scoring opportunities, and, at least for me, it is not at all apparent what the best paths are to win the game, at least on the first plays.

I am not sure how to rate this one, as I suspect it blossoms into a great game with understanding the scoring and importance of each tract.  For now, I rate it Meh.

Thoughout the whole game, I felt really frustrated that I couldn't do anything, I did not have enough time/workers/money do to what I wanted. I was completely confused about what do to. Which is not a bad thing. Except, I ended up 2nd. The 2 guys below me were actually the only ones who played before (multiple times) and loved the game. I still don't know what I did to end up 2nd. It just left a really bad taste.

Really nice game with pretty straightforward rules and a good clear rulebook.
On your turn you either put workers on or take workers off and perform the action they were stood next to. Simple enough.

There is a lot of symbolism here (they made the board language independent) and so there is a lot of checking what they all actually mean.

The board has a really shiny finish which whilst it looks nice is not that practical when you are playing if there is even the slightest bit of sunshine. 

It is very reminiscent of agricola in that you are trying to build an engine with the buildings you buy but at the same time you have to keep a stockpile of corn to 'feed' your workers at several points in the game. However it is really quite slow, resources are difficult to acquire in any number and as there are monuments that you can build that cost of lot of resources you can spend the whole game just trying to acquire the resources  build a single monument.

The starting advantages that you get are really nice and give re playability. Next time I pick I will definitely look for more resources on the two start tokens rather than sheer number of corn.

The gears are novel and they do rotate well (unlike 011 which requires unwinding every so often) but it is a bit of a gimmick. All there are is essentially a turn timer.

A complex game built around a very simple core mechanism: you either place workers on or you take them from the gears. The board is beautiful and entrancing and looks like a toy on the table. Very intimidating at first too. The game scales surprisingly well from two to four players. It has a quirky cost function, which makes placing workers more expensive than feeding them. But it is the most perfect representation of the time value of money which I have yet seen in a board game. It could easily be re-themed as a game about high finance and private equity investments.

RATING: 4
Played 1 time with 4 players for 2.25 hours.

Well...um...it's certainly a Euro. 

Actually, this game is noteworthy to me for exactly one reason: it's the title that (for me) killed the Euro. I see the cool dials and I think "Neat-O!" then I look at the rest of the board: VP opportunities everywhere, "tech" tracks, "buildings"...and I get a sinking feeling. 30 minutes into the game I kept thinking "Point salad. I get it. I get why Trashers hate Euros."

And as the game wore on, and AP increased, and as I thought about the high ranking this game currently holds on the Geek (#16 as I write this), I realized that Euros don't seem to be going anywhere. Worker placement; abilities that flip resources into other resources, or into resource/VP abilities, or resource/VP bonuses, or VPs...

I've done this all before. And it's not interesting any more. And the wheel, cool idea in theory, was a minor novelty that kept my interest for about 30 minutes. 

Tzolk'in broke the Euro. I'm glad others like this title, but after growing more and more dissatisfied with "pure" Euros, I think I'm nearly done with them. When they are simpler and play in 30-45, they seem to work for me, but Tzolk'in is - to my mind exactly what's gone wrong with Euro games - and with it's high ranking, I think it can be fairly said that my gaming tastes have been diverging for quite some time.

If you are a Euro lover, enjoy this game, it has everything you love. Every thing. All those things. Those same old things...

Half way through the game it became apparent this game had much more depth than I thought.  After only one play it appears to be a very tight game, and that I can't concentrate heavily on one element of the game & expect to win.  I have to do some of each, but most importantly, at the right time.  The gears are a unique touch, but if the puzzle board is even slightly warped, the gears do not always move easily.

I'm rating Tzolk'in more harshly than I normally would because of all the hype it's been getting recently, which has turned me off to the game even more than it's mediocrity alone would have.

It's a euro with a big fancy gear in the middle. It has a lot of the complicated upkeep associated with heavy euros, but it's not a heavy euro, because having a bunch of complicated game mechanics that add nothing to enjoyment or strategy is pointless and insults the intelligence of the player.

There have been only a few games in my history of modern board gaming that have absolutely "wowed" me when I first played them: Settlers of Catan (my first real Euro), Caylus, Hansa Teutonica, and now Tzolk'in.  Yes, I had heard all about how the gears were either just a gimmick or were essential to the game depending on who I listened to, and had high expectations coming into my first play.  But these expectations were actually exceeded.  Now I like abstract games just fine, and I can see how this game might not impress people who need theme.  What do I like about this game?:
- The gears are cool, actually save time and help significantly reduce the fiddliness factor, but this game would be pretty much as great without them.  
- There are all kinds of ways to get points and so much good stuff to do with only a hope of doing a fraction of it all.  I was surprised by the sheer number of options available once the various buildings, technology tracks and ways to gather resources are taken into account.
- Each game can play out differently depending on which monuments are randomly dealt out at the beginning of the game.
- Each turn is divided into small bite-sized chunks, making this game fit into my personal "sweet spot" of just the right granularity level.
- Game length can be somewhat controlled by the players.
- It plays great with 2, 3, or 4 players.
- The production quality is nothing short of superb.

I don't really care for the theme, but it's easy to ignore, and the mechanics fit decently with it.  If you love worker placement, you HAVE to at least try this game.

I find it difficult to introduce new games with a weight over 3 so I was really pleased when, after 10 months on the shelf, I managed to get a game of TZolk'in!

Initial impressions are good.  It was a three player game and we all really enjoyed it and carried on discussing tactics after the end of the game (always a good sign!).  

I'm giving this a tentative rating of 8 at this stage which will obviously move with more plays.

UPDATE 04/06/2014: rating upped to 9 as this game has it all really.

This was not on my radar prior to the Fair as I thought the wheel mechanism was only a nice gimmik and an eye catcher. However, it works great in the game.

Edit Dec. 2012: rating up to 9 after now 4 games. Great game! Works perfectly with two players as well. Each time I tried a completely different strategy, and there are still more I wanna try. In this game timing is everything.

Tzolk'in: the Mayan Calendar is not just another worker placement game, and if you thought that, well, let itself prove you wrong.

This is the first game, of all the ones I know, that adds a truly dynamic aspect to the worker placement genre: to succeed on this game, you have not just to figure out where to place your workers (as in Agricola, Caylus or the majority of games ot this genre), but also when to place them, and to develope the ability of visualize, beforehand, the outcome of its future actions (anticipating even 7 rounds before!). 

Another great achievement of Tzolk'in is that the theme doesn't feel "artificial" or "superfluous", as sadly happens with a lot of "euro-style" board games. In fact, in my opinion, Tzolk'in's success lies in that its core mechanic and its theme are one and the same: the passage of time! Here, the wheels mechanism isn't just a "glossy" and unnecesary element, it's the opposite: they're the soul of the game, the part that, literally, moves the game!

On top of all the previous, I'm pretty confident to say that Tzolk'in offers a rich, deep, rewarding and enjoyable game experience; a highly strategical, but at the same time tactical, game with tons of replayability.

Plus all the mentioned strong points, its production quality is tremendous: a phenomenal artwork + one of the more beautifull gameboards ever designed + top-notch components...

What else can I say? In my top ten board games list, Tzolk'in has earned a fixed place.

Very, very close to perfection!

RATING: 6
Kicsomagolás, összeszerelés, és egy rövidke próbajáték után az érzéseim:
- A játék sokkal szebb, mint gondoltam. A táblán csodálatosan részletes a grafika, maga a tábla meglepően csillogós. Nem kell megijedni, nem gagyin csillog, hanem szépen. Gondolom a kerekek koptató hatása miatt kellett ez a bevonat rá. Minden token szép, letisztult, érthető. A fa elemek átlagosak, a mechanizmus miatt nem nagyon lehetett díszíteni őket, így meg kell elégedni a henger alakú munkásokkal, és korong jelzőkkel. A kerekek elég jó minőségű műanyagból vannak, nem az a gagyi kopogós fajta. Egy negatívum: a dobozra kívülről rá van ragasztva egy matrica, miszerint mielőtt összerakod a táblát menj fel az megadott weblapra. A weblapon kiderül, hogy a végső tábla nem teljesen olyan méretekkel készült, mint amire számítottak, így a kerekek tengelyének szánt lukakon kb. 0,5 millimétert tágítani kell. Így az első játék előtt számítson mindenki egy kis barkácsolásra, mert különben szorulni fognak a kerekek, tekerésnél le fognak potyogni a bábuk. (Én végül egy megfelelő méretű ceruza segítségével tágítottam, és egy teknősös kulcstartó fejével lapítottam a megfelelőre a lyukakat )
- A szabálykönyv szintén nagyon szép. Részletes, minden példákkal, képekkel van illusztrálva, sőt még két teljes példakör is van benne. Nem kell megijedni a 16 oldaltól, nem bonyolult, azért hosszú, mert minden részletesen le van írva, és illusztrálva.
- A rövidke próbajáték után nagyon izgalmasnak érzem a játékot. Rengeteg fejvakarós szituáció tud adódni. Nem egyértelműen olyan nagy előny a sok munkás, mint sok más játékban, mivel a lehelyezésük pénzbe (gabonába) kerül. Minél többet teszel le egy körben annál drágább. Viszont ugyebár vagy felveszel munkásokat, vagy leteszel, így ha apránként teszed le őket, akkor köröket vesztesz, ha meg egyben mindig mindet leteszed és mindet felveszed, akkor egy vagyon költesz erre. Fogalmas sincs egyelőre, hogy hol van az egyensúly.
Érdekes még ez kerékre lerakósdi is, mivel messze nem csak arról van szó, hogy minél tovább van lent a munkás annál több cuccot hoz. Általában egészen eltérő dolgok vannak egymást követő fogakon, így nagyon jól kell időzíteni a felszedést, hogy ne egyesével kelljen őket szedegetni. Ráadásul gonosz módon, muszáj leszedned, ha nem tudsz letenni munkást, így egyértelműen szívhatsz egy-egy rossz időzítéssel, mert idő előtt le kell szedned a kerékről a figurát, és kapsz mondjuk egy kő helyett egy fát, amire nincs is éppen szükséged.
Ami még érdekes a kerekekben, hogy mindig a legelső még szabadon lévő pozícióra lehet letenni munkást. Így aki később tesz nincs egyértelműen hátrányban, mert ugyan kell neki plusz gabonákat betenni, viszont egy kör alatt eljuthat oda, ahová mások 3-4 kör alatt. Megintcsak marhára jól kell időzíteni, és a ellenfelek játékát olvasni.

Összességében egy gyönyörű és számomra nagyon ígéretes játéknak tűnik. A szabály a hosszúság ellenére a játék nem bonyolult. Mondjuk nem egy családi, de azért normális ember és geek között félúton lévő barátainknak is meg lehet tanítani.

Szerdán gémbe tervezem levinni, meg lehet csodálni, érdeklődés függvényében ki is lehet próbálni.


szerk:
Még egy-két gondolat, ami eszembe jutott:
- A próbajáték alapján szerintem két játékossal is nagyon jól működik. Ilyenkor a kerekeken bizonyos pozíciókat fixen le kell blokkolni, de ez ugyebár a tekeréssel folyamatosan odébb tolódik.
- Egy negatívum az alkatrészekkel kapcsoltban: a nyersanyagok kicsit gyengébb fény mellet már nagyon nehezen megkülönböztethetőek. Főleg az arany és a fa keverhető.
- Mechanizmusban még, ami izgalmas, de nem írtam:
1. jópofa, hogy nem ugyanazokkal a nyersanyagokkal kezdenek a játékosok, hanem 4 véletlenszerűen osztott indulólapkából választanak kettőt az játék elején és ez alapján kapnak nyersanyagokat, búzát, pozíciókat a technológiai skálán és a templomokban. Így nincs az, hogy mindenkinek ugyanaz kell a játék elején, illetve minden játék első pár köre ugyanaz.
2. Az újrajátszhatóságot a monument nevű épületek biztosítják. A játék elején kiteszünk véletlenszerűen 6 ilyen épületet. Ezek nagyon drágák, és csak a játék végén érnek pontokat. Hasonlóan a stone age-hez (egiziához), olyasmik után kapjuk a pontot, mint a munkások száma, megépült ilyen-olyan épületek száma stb. De a fentiekkel ellentétben itt minden játékban csak ez a 6 áll rendelkezésre, nem jön fel új, nem pörög végig a pakli, így minden játékban más és más dolgok azok, amikkel nagyot lehet szakítani a végén. 

---
Az a fő baj ezzel a játékkal, hogy nem különösebben szórakoztató. Olyan képességeket tornásztat meg, amiben egy kétsoros program is sokkal jobb az embernél. Meddő felhasználása a szőlőcukornak.

This is my highest rated game that doesn't have a map (well Codenames is one notch higher, but mainly because of who I can play it with). I love the way a time dimension has been added so elegantly. It's a joy to explore the myriad paths to points, especially since they change a bit every game depending on which Monuments come out.

If it weren't for the giant turning cogs I think Tzolkin would run the risk of being easily written off as yet another overloaded worker placement game. Even so, aren't those wheels just a big gimmick the novelty of which will wear off quickly and leave you with exactly the kind of game you didn't think it was?

Probably not. The designers deserve praise for creating a gimmick that really is mechanically integrated with the game. Even if the gimmick gets old, the underlying game design still stays relevant. It's just a great engineering solution (Le Havre and Macao come to mind as examples of games that use similar mechanisms but implemented them differently).

So how about the game? At its core it's the fairly standard "collect resources, convert to victory points" mantra. There is a small tech tree and a (fairly uninspired, I thought) set of buildings and monuments that can be erected for points or other benefits. Despite the tech tree and being able to recruit new workers, Tzolkin is suprisingly light on engine building which is at least part of the reason that the game feels more tactical than strategic despite the planning required to use your workers properly.

This, of course, is where the game differentiates itself from the competition. The restrictions around placing and retrieving your workers, and the increase in power the longer a worker stays put are where the game is. Unlike some other games that have experimented with various twists to the basic worker placement idea, Tzolkin feels fully developed, well-rounded and complete. The cogs are merely a reflection of that thoroughness.

A very good variant of the worker placement idea. The fact that you either place your workers or activate them makes some nice decisions.
What I'm missing is the feeling to become stronger. Mostly the last rounds are the same as the first rounds. I prefer games like Terra Mystica or Settlers of Caan where you are much more powerful at the end of the game.

29/01/2016: I think my love for this game is heavy linked to the flavor/mechanical design, while managing to be a great competitive game. I will have to play more to have a better judgment.
27/04/2016: Used a "cheat" to obtain tons of resources. Group didn't like it. Game got shelved :(. Can the expansion fix this? Going down to 9.5.
16/05/2016: So after playing two more times and winning with skulls and corn, the group really saw there were more strategies to win, despite having tons of resources and "money" in the game. Motivated to buy expansion to see if the game improves.

RATING: 7
The game looked intimidating at first; a very small rules explanation was served and we jumped right in. The game basics started making sense after several turns (about 1/4 of the game). We played with 4 players (3 new) and the total time including setup, rules and cleanup was a little over 2 hours. I think this is a very good worker placement game. The board looks amazing and the gear mechanic is excellent. I like that the gameplay is straightforward and there are many paths to victory. However, the game length and the potential for severe AP (we didn't have that in our game) make me refrain from rating it higher.

Worker placement game that adds an additional element of time.   Workers move on the various wheels based on the passage on time to more valuable locations.  Since you must either place or remove workers on each turn, working out the timing to get the most value out of your workers adds a lot to the game.

RATING: 6
Played with 'Tribes & Prophecies' expansion

Like most, I appreciate the gears mechanic. I don't think it's gimmicky at all- it solves the problem where all pieces become more valuable after each round, and one doesn't have to worry about any fiddly bit movement, using the gears to shift everything at once. However, once the you get the fundamental system out of the way, you have a very rehashed WP game that offers nothing that hasn't been seen before. And the basic decision of "place worker / remove worker" feels boring after awhile. This game was quite intriguing and even fun to play after the first hour. When we were hitting the 3-hour mark, I felt quite uninspired by the whole thing. The game also has no catch-up mechanisms, which I don't think are always necessary, but new players are usually going to be decimated by seasoned players. There were three new players here. We played around and experimented and two of us were tidily punished by the game for not having a long-range plan to begin with. The third newbie was fortunate enough to pursue a building route, and had enough special powers going into the early next rounds that he could make up for some of his own experimentation.

Anyway, I am a Euro fan and a WP fan. I like the game as it stands as that. But it doesn't do anything intriguing beyond the gears, and those in themselves are nothing but a clean system for shifting pieces. I'd play again, and probably enjoy myself more with the familiarity. But I don't really know if the AP and play time are worth it when there are much cleaner, crisper WP games out there.

RATING: 2
Half an hour into the game, when I start to feel very bored, someone comes by and says: "Oh, that's the game that made me realize that I don't like euros!".
And even though I am generally a big euro-fan I could understand exactly what he meant.
This was an utterly soulless game machine. And the critique, that with euros you just play against the game rather than against your competitors, never felt so true.
It actually made me quite depressed. Like seeing an illusionist explain and show all his tricks in broad daylight, or realizing that the emperor is naked.
(Or rather: there is nothing wrong with the clothing. The problem is that the emperor is a beutifully dressed up robot.)
Even the cool cogs works as an image of game designing as an engineering process performed by men in white coats in a sterile laboratory, rather than developed round a table in warm and friendly company.
I love a good euro. But this will follow me like a shadow when I see similar mechanics in other games, even if they are used for a better whole. 
No shadow on my fellow gamers at the table though. :)

Enjoyable time mechanic. Game is dominated by one strategy (resource tech track + abusing Gold/Stone/2Corn location + trading), as it is mathematically superior to other strategies.

4 plays so far and we've been enjoying this game quite a bit.  It took a while to start getting the rhythm down and we are starting to understand the tremendous depth of play here.  We tried a few different strategies and found that the quality of a player's execution seemed to count for more that anything else.

The game's theme fits quite well and the gears make it easier to play (and more memorable) than if it had just been a bunch of linear tracks instead.

Along with Stone Age, this is one of the better worker placement games out there. Not very difficult ruleset, but I find myself struggling to do well at the game.

Worker placement with an interesting time element.  To perform well, one has to efficiently schedule the placement of his workers and the removal of his workers over a number of turns, while simultaneously competing with other players for scarce board positions.  Seems to have good balance, with room for multiple strategies.  Good bits, although I could do without the glossy board.

On the negative side, Tzolk'in can be something of a trigger for analysis paralysis.  It's also a tricky game to teach, as there are a lot of different elements to go over.

Splendid worker placement/displacement game with a novel mechanism for LITERALLY "seeing the gears turn." The Mayan theme works well for keeping track of commodities, building a money engine to convert to points. The religion tracks seem to be pretty weighty in terms of scoring, as well as the crystal skulls. Corn alone wouldn't net you enough to keep up otherwise, and corn (money) is tight. Good game, some good decision making involved because you must plan things for a few literal turns ahead. Components are mostly nice, but I hate the tiny discs CGE puts puts out there.

Lately I've been enjoying simpler and more accessible games again, where everyone can join and noone feels left out because they don't get all the rules.

This game does feel more complex than it needs to be.  The different resources might have been designed to be one resource, to give one example. It feels just like another medium-complex resource-management euro to me, even despite it has the wheel-mechanic.  I don't see a real reason to play this instead of any other resource-management/workerplacement, I just don't think it feels innovative or different enough.

It's also too long.

This is of course subjective.  I just think this is more of the same.

But then again: I used to like these kind of games very much, and I recognize it's great if you enjoy the genre.

So far, Tzolkin unveils itself as an excellent workers placement game. It is not just a game with a gimmick, but a very good game with some genious touches like the way the wheels are moved or the way that the placement of the workers is designed, very novelty and innovative. I do love the fights for the food in the Palenque wheel or the timing neccesary for a good sacrifice in Chitzen Itza. The game is brutal and I really think that rewards wise gameplay, it is not familiar at all since you have to feed your workers and food is somewhat scarce. Components are extremelly nice, sturdy gameboard, beautiful bits... probably the best 2012 game (definitly the best one I had played so far).

This game strikes a wonderful balance of having simple rules and limited choices every turn, yet still has brain-burning strategic and tactical choices. The gears really work, it's a lot of fun and it feels very unique. Most worker placement games have a set starting path, usually involving getting more workers, but this game is so open even from the start. Blocking and the occasional double tick of the gear add just enough player interaction to make the game tense, but not frustrating.

This game is great, and honestly, I feel a little bad only rating it an 8, because I think it might be better than that.

It's got exactly what I love in games:  simple, straightforward rules mixed with incredibly deep strategy.  I might be overstating both of those things, but you have two options on your turn:  pick up pawns, or put them down. That's it. And you're only putting them on one of 5 wheels.

Now, WHICH ones do you put them on?  That is the strategy.  Subtle as it is, it's super intricate.  In many ways, it's what I wish Le Havre had going for it - multiple paths to victory.  There really are just a number of ways to win this game I think, and it's going to shift depending on what opponents choose to do, and consequently, leave open.

I think this is a game where tactics come into play a lot.  Strategy is important, but a great strategy is to be adaptable and tactically versatile.

I look forward to playing this game a lot more in the future.

Personal: rules seem to be easy, place workers or recover workers, move the gears... but this is not the classic worker placement game, this is also about timing. You need to place your workers in the correct gear at the best time in the best moment. 
You have also several ways to score points, so what else could you ask for?

Very solid game, but after enough plays a dominant strategy emerges which can limit replay value.  That said it was about 50 for me before I got tired of it, so given that number certainly worth picking up.  Best with 4 and pretty weak with 2 due to the dominant strategy being the only option in a 2 player game.

I'm going to initially rate Tzolk'in just above an 8. It is very good, I enjoy playing it and would suggest it. That said, Tzolkin is one of the hardest games in my collection to rate. The aesthetic of the game is amazing. The gears and theme are awesome. The rules simplicity to depth ratio is exactly what I am looking for. This game was MUCH harder than I anticipated after reading the rules and will require multiple plays to play well. Furthermore, the feeding your workers mechanic was far more punishing than I imagined and frankly a bit un-fun. I can see this game rising in to a top 5 game over time, or it could fall to the low 7's. I will always appreciate it. But will I want to play it?

Tzolk'in : The Mayan Calendar is a different kind of worker placement game.  The gears makes this game different and very strategic.
The rules are pretty simple for a game so engaging.  On your turn, you add 1 or more worker OR you remove 1 or more worker.  You do the action when you remove worker.  The longer a worker stays on the board, the better the action.
You really have to plan ahead what you want to do.
From what I've learn in the first game I've played, don't let one player be dominant in all of the three temple!

Great worker placement game. Granted there is as usual resource gathering and turn resources into bonuses or victory points. But it still felt fresh when playing the first time. My strategy that let me win the first time did not work the second time. As your fellow players anticipate what you're doing you as well have to look what your co players do. Great game!
edit: even after 5 plays with different strategies (some winning some not) the Monuments were always to expensive to buy, also for most fellow players. As resources are worth some victory at the end you really have to calculate if it pays out investing 4 gold+ to buy a monument.
edit: after 8 plays I had to update my rating to a 9. The game is every time different with the need of an adjusted tactic/strategy. So it is interesting also with repeated plays.

Played one game with 3 players. Of the games I played during Essen 12 there were 4 medium heavy weight, 2 hour Euros which I thought were fantastic. Suburbia, Keyflower, Tzolk'in and Myrmes. With more plays I suppose I will form a favourite but for now I rate them as equally enjoyable. Oct 2012

*UPDATE* Following my 5th play I am upping this to a 9. It scratches the same itch as Caylus and it does it better. Currentally my favourite gamers game, it even edges out Keyflower as my game of Essen 2012. Jan 2013

Interesting game, where you have to constantly way the benefits of NOW to the benefits TOMORROW will bring. I love that kind of stuff, and I love seeing long lasting plans come to fruition in ear splitting explosions of creativity. 

There is something of magic that tickles my imagination. Recommended for euro heavy players.

I know, it's a spreadsheet with a neat delivery system. But every strategy I try turns out to reap rewards, if timed correctly. A surprisingly varied experience.

And the timing of the wheels is so much fun. This could, of course, be done with markers and spreadsheet boxes, but designers, take note. Gimmicks are more fun than no-gimmicks, particularly when they're this functional, and when players actively fight over who gets to turn the wheel.

The rare game I like where I find the expansion significantly diminishes the experience.

EDIT: I played Tzolk'in again but with the people special powers and I think this allows the game to be much more focused and so the AP as decreased a lot thanks to that.  Tzolk'in is a really nice euro game.  The clockwork mechanism is not so innovative but it's a great bookkeeping mechanic that helps the game not becoming too fiddly.  The theme is not so present but the board looks gorgeous.  Why I also like a lot is that it is possible to go for a lot of different strategies but at the same time the game really punishes poor decisions and in both game we played, me and another player really pulled ahead while the other two were left behind so this is not probably a good game for novice gamers.

A really clever euro game with a great theme and even better table-presence. The mechanisms of this game are very clever. It's not your average workerplacement game, you really have to think ahead and have a certain goal in mind when you play this.

My biggest problem is that this game really makes my head spin. I try to avoid falling victim to analysis paralysis but I just can't help it with Tzolk'in. I want to like this game, I want to be better at it, but it's really difficult. To the games credit it's not incredibly hard to teach. With some games I'll have no idea what's going on even after playing it (Brass comes to mind). With Tzolk'in I get what the game is all about. It's just hard to play and be successful at it.

Tzolk'in catches player's eyes from across the room with its board full of functioning gears. In a game about the Mayan calendar, it's great to see time being such a big part of gameplay - and the player's plans. Of course the gears could be replaced with player's actions but that would bring upkeep through the roof between turns.

Good board design and iconography.

By far the most complicated worker placement game I have come across.  This game forces you to think 4-5 turns ahead and I have never played a game where someone has scored more than 40 points in the end.  Very fun, very challenging, but certainly not a game for the newly initiated.

Tzolk'in was the first worker placement game I tried that I enjoyed. While still making you feed your workers, it doesn't punish you out of the game when you fail to do so; in fact it can be a strategic move to spend your corn on other things and take the small hit in points. Also the wheel mechanism for worker placement & action selection really appeals to the advance planner in me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's not every game that alters the landscape of a tried and true mechanic like worker placement, but Tzolk'in does it with the "dynamic worker placement" mechanism. It deserves the accolades it gets, but it does suffer from the problem that a reasonable strategy is just "go for the skulls." Against good players that likely won't work, but against bad players it's just fine. Much like "Big Money" in Dominion will win against bad players.

RATING: 7.5
The calendar gears are the biggest draw to this game, but they are just a fancy and practical way to move pawns in several lines. You perform actions by taking back your pawns, but advancing in those lines/gears gives them more powerful actions. As a result, you will often want to leave pawns on the gears for several turns, and it takes a long time to get things accomplished.

The actions are varied and there are several strategic paths. There is just a little randomness in the starting resources and buildings available, enough to give the game some variety. The design is solid, but it is ultimately an efficiency exercise in gathering resources to improve your engine and convert to victory points - all wrapped in a very thin veil of theme. It takes some time to teach, but the individual actions and bonuses are very simple and intuitive, and the iconography works, so that there aren't many questions during the game.

I know that my description does not sound very exciting, but, surprisingly, I have been enjoying the exploration of the game's possibilities and find myself wanting to play more. I wonder, however, how long that will last.

Euro de colocacion de trabajadores, con tematica ambientada en el Imperio Maya. 

Multitud de acciones que realizar, ciertas interacciones con los otros jugadores, y el gran punto del juego: los jugadores emplazan a los trabajadores en las tareas, pero estas casillas de tareas contienen unas ruedas dentadas, que a lo largo de la ronda de juego se mueven, estableciendo un nuevo nivel en el juego y en la interaccion entre jugadores.

While it's not a bad game, it could have been streamlined, but even if, it doesn't do anything that I can't get in xx other games already. This one is just more complicated and overloaded.

I'm sure most ppl like it because of the wheels, but the mechanic alone isn't new at all, it's just pushing the workers onto the next best spot. Sure, it's much easier this way, but nothing spectacular at all.

If you don't know many other games, this might look good, but there are many similar ones that do it better.

Many winning strategies and the game is a learner where you will be discovering new paths for a long time to come. So glad to own this puppy!

Just behind Snowdonia, this was my second favourite game from Essen. I'd feared a gimmick, but the gears idea works brilliantly and I was sucked in from the start. There's an awful lot to plan and think about, making it a heavy euro for sure, and bad planning can really be punished. But if you like a long, thinky two-hour worker placement I'd say this is a must try.

The gear mechanism is neat at first.  By the end of the first game, though, the novelty wears out... it strikes me as somewhat gimmicky.

It seemed like a bonanza of opportuinites for different paths to victory at first. Then it showed that if you're trying to play it in a spur-of-the-moment tactical way, you'll inevitably lose to the guy who sticks to his gameplan from beginning to end. Couple this with marginal indirect interaction at best and you've got a game that promisses lots of opportunities, but delivers an experience that punishes you for straying off your preset path. While I know that lots of people like that, I don't.

It forces you to think ahead and plan out the future. It's MUCH more forgiving than some other Euros (IE Agricola) in that it doesn't suck all the wind out of you during the "feed your family" phases.

The gears prevent the game from being overly fiddly and add quite nicely to the overall theme of the game. There are several strategies available to take, and the player interaction becomes quite fun and challenging.

A very solid Euro, with a fun theme, and great balance.

Played at bgg.con.  Wow.... was that uninspiring.  The wheels are innovative in functionality only- not truly new mechanics.  And the rest is a pasted on mess.  Nevertheless, it would still rate as an average JASE except for the option to move the gears twice instead of once.  It makes fore-planning pointless.  And turns where you do nothing but wait for your workers to get to the right spot are offensive to the player.

Excellent euro brain burn

Updated to a 10 - now about 4/5 games in and it has excellent replayability. Definitely best with 4 and a real brain burner throughout

OK - so I played it a few times more with 2/3... it's actually better with these numbers than I gave it credit for. It's certainly best with 4 but it's better with 2/3 than 95% of games out there (even many that are designed specifically for 2/3)

This game is easily the best game out there and has knocked stone age off it's perch as the number 1 worker placement

---

So my alternative rules which balance it:

Randomise turn order. 1st player takes 3 wealth tiles, 2nd player takes 4, 3rd player takes 5, 4th player takes 6. Any dummy workers get given the standard 6 each for 3-4 player games.

Then starting with the 1st player, select 2 tiles and turn them face up, then 2nd player selects 2, then third selects 2, then 4th.

Advantages: Later players in the turn order get the chance to be more reactive to the expected moves of the earlier players. In the standard rules it is horribly OP in favour of the start player

---

Yeh - I'm downgrading this to 7.5. Don't get me wrong, I still like it and the mechanisms in it are very clever and more than just a gimmick. But the lack of balance and quality of the dominant strategy mean it can become a bit dull

It seems like just another worker placement game--place workers to gather resources, which are then turned into buildings and VP. However, with asymmetric starting conditions for each player (like in Leonardo Da Vinci), and five circular queues controlled by a master calendar, this is one insanely intriguing and fascinating design.

The circular queue is arguably the most unique game innovation to date, giving a breath of fresh air to what has become a glut of "me too" worker placement games. I was beginning to tire of the next boring, soulless iteration in this genre, but this has got me thinking and excited again about worker placement games. Each queue can be "programmed" with one or more workers, depending on how far up each spot is. With each game turn, the master calendar turns each queue up one notch, with progressively better and more powerful choices. However, a player can only place or remove workers, but not both, making for delicious, agonizing decisions with every click of the gears.

While there are some random and hidden elements (i.e., starting resources/positions, buildings, monuments), it is near-perfect information, much like Puerto Rico. The decision space is very large and seems overwhelming at first, but becomes manageable, as killer combinations begin to materialize. The decision tree is constantly changing with every player's worker placement and removal; with three other players sharing the queues, it is rather chaotic like Roborally. Still, long term planning becomes key, say two to three turns ahead.

Replayability is high, since starting conditions for each player is different for every game. With the variety of buildings and monuments available also being different every game, this effectively nulls out any standard "opening move". These random elements also set the tone and theme for each game, keeping it fresh and new.

Components are top-notch, typical of Rio Grande. Rules are quite dense, but well written. However, a number of the finer points of the rules were missed or misinterpreted. After several games, most of the game concepts become intuitive, and the play goes quicker and smoother. The initial two plays clocked in at 2.5 hours for 4-players, but I suspect this could get down to the published 90 minute figure with more experience. Still, there may be occasional "bumps" of AP in the first plays.

This is an exceptional game, in terms of gaming innovation, novelty, and simple fun. The chopping of trees and harvesting of corn is reminiscent of Antiquity, without the pollution. The action spaces are quite varied and interesting, not like in a majority of other worker placement games. There is the feeling of desperation, as the calendar ticks away, much like The Princes of Machu Picchu. The queues remind me of the varied production calendars in Eve:Conquests. The overall look and feel is along the lines of Hawaii. This game does a wonderful job of invoking the feel of many of these games, and yet it is a unique animal, all with a feel of its own. The fact that it has risen so quickly through the BGG rankings is a testament to its novelty and thoughtfully engaging gameplay. It's a solid '8'.

Pssst. Shhh. Can I just say, I think people are over-excited about this one. It's a good basic euro with an okay theme (there's the rub) and a gimmicky central mechanic. It's not unclever in the integration of that mechanic with its theme, and it's an elegant way to create a timing element. It works. But I guess it's probably the theme. I didn't feel very invested in what I was doing. Another Eclipse for me: nothing wrong with it, but I don't share the excitement.

Too much of the game scoring is dependant on the religion track. You must pray adequately to Mayan deities or be elbowed for your lack of faith at every feeding round with a final knee to a groin at end-game scoring. Any player who attempted a strategy devoid of faith will be knocked out by the Mayan gods fairly early-on.

Thus match-ups are pretty samey in each game. Either copiously pray and try do so economically or pay the price for being an atheist. The score differential is massive between a devout Mayan shaman versus a sacrilegious heathen. No religion at your own peril.

After reading a lot about it I didn't think I would like this game ... but I loved it.

The gears are an excellent mechanic (with a somewhat similar effect to the windrose in Macao) & turns are agonising: either place or remove workers (not both!)

Lots of different ways to win.

Update: after 7 plays the shine is starting to come off just a bit & we seem to have fallen into standard strategies instead of creating new ones.  Still quite an enjoyable game though.

Best Game of the Year!! Well 2013 just started but this game was technically released in Europe in 2012 so let me clarify by saying Best Game of 2012!! Wow, I have not been this excited since I played Power Grid in 2010. What makes this game Great:
1) Fancy artwork and visually appealing once the cogs are painted. 
2) Not just your regular worker placement game but with a new time mechanism by rotating gears which syncs with other gears. Turning the cogs represent time/days passing and coordinating your workers to combo actions is a great woohoo(Simpsons) feeling. It is like party planning where you send out multiple people to different locations to gather food, drinks, supplies, decorations, entertainment and having them all return at the exact time.
3) Multiple paths to victory. There are more than one way to score points (either temples, skulls, monuments or buildings) and different approaches to them.
4) Random starting tiles and monuments will alter your winning strategies from the last.
5) Low Luck. A new player is very unlikely to beat an experience player. 
6) Great with 2-4 players.
7) The game play is elegant and smooth. You are mainly placing or removing workers. 

Go get it !

At heart this is just another worker placement game, which isn't my favourite type of Euro. The gimmick is the gear wheels, which don't offering any fundamental improvement over Caylus (from which this has borrowed its development track). Some of the buildings are just wrongly priced (3 resources for a building that moves you up the Development Track, which only makes sense if you're moving from space 2 to space 3, yet the building is in the early deck). The gears are at least original, but in the end this just bored me rigid.

RATING: 8
Oooh, this is cool.  The gears look gimmicky, and I guess it would be possible to have the game without them if you didn't mind making the game RIDICULOUSLY FIDDLY, but not only do the gears save you from that, but also, come one, this board is awesome. The game is pretty cool too. As one might expect, it's a planning game, and a pretty intense one. However, it doesn't feel as stressful to the new player as planning-heavy games often can; it's important to get the people in the right place at the right time, but plans can change, and it's all kind of a balancing act trying to manage it correctly.  That's not the whole game, either; there's a tradeoff between resources and points, there's jockeying for position on the god tracks, and especially, there are the special ability tiles which make a huge difference in the game.  This is really cool, you guys. (4 plays)

LOVE this game. Not a beginner game by any means. If you've played more than 10 modern designer boardgames though, this game will be picked up fairly easily. This game is brutal for us for AP(analaysis paralysis) though, because every action is brutally important for this turn and the next.

I really enjoyed my first play of the game.  It was innovative exciting and full of possibilities.  Then I got the game to the table with a different group of players only to find the game has scripted engines that drive away from all that is fun about the game.  The player then described that he was playing one of the weaker scripted strategies.  I havent played the game since as all the energy of the game was sapped away.

The more I play it, the more I love it. This game, it's all about planning in advance and timing, the way each game develops rests entirely on the ability of the players.

It's very unforgiving towards less experienced players, one mistake, one move too early (or too late) can cost you quite a lot of points. You have to carefully plan your game in advance, and quickly adapt your strategy to the other players' moves.

Great game, a lot of meat to chew on. Love it.

Decent, but didn't really grab me in any meaningful way.  The game was pretty much a hodgepodge of different scoring mechanisms with no real cohesion.

Excellent game with nice planning, many paths to score and tension all along the way. It just lacks a bit of interaction, but it is what it is, the system works really well! It's a game to play and replay, trying different strategies to reach a full understanding of the game. Really worth to have! A must try.

Edit: after some more games I think the monuments are a bit broken. They are too hard to achieve and they worth not the (hard) effort. Players who use the logic ways (skulls and temples) seems to have most of the time a big advantage.

Having played this numerous times, this game lends itself to numerous paths to victory that invite that replayability. The gear mechanic is just for show - in its heart, this is just a worker placement game - but the visual ease (albeit in a brain-burning sense) the gears provide many paths for your brain to explore. Components are wonderful. Would not recommend with less than 4.

A stimulating, brain burning worker placement game with cool gears that add a temporal twist.  The longer your workers stay on a gear, the better the reward.  This game is quite unforgiving for planning errors.  You have to be good at planning a few moves in advance to be able to excel in this game.  The quality of the components and the artwork on the board is superb.  It just doesn't strike me as the type of game I would want to play over and over again, but I do like to occasionally insert it into the rotation.

Very good game. All those options you have to choose from every turn! It's  a good idea everyone has to pick 2 Starting Wealth Tiles out of 4 at the beginning of the game, which determines your starting capital. The tile that allows you to receive an extra worker is very powerful - almost too powerful in combination with the building tile where your workers require 1 less corn each...

Tzolk'in, The Mayan Calendar is a worker placement game where you place your pieces on one of 5 gears that are all controlled by a large central gear. On your turn you either place one or more workers OR remove one or more workers. When you remove a worker, you take the action. Every turn the gear moves, improving the actions for all of the placed workers. So this is a game where timing your actions on multiple gears to get and do what you need to is key. There are a lot of ways to score points and I think we learned that you best figure out what to specialize in early and go for it.  

An attractive and fresh-feeling take on a mechanic (worker placement) that is seeing a fair amount of over-use the last few years.

Sorry to say, I have to post a somewhat negative commentary on this game.  The spinning wheels look great, and everyone was initially excited about the game.  Now only a few die-hards will play it in tournaments.  I got in around a dozen plays and after the first three or four, I got less and less interested in playing it.  Why?  Big problem is lack of multiple paths to victory.  To me, the key is moving up the temple track as it scores four times during the game (twice in bonus resources, twice in bonus points).  Then the game devolves into devising the best tactics to accomplish this, which to me is not very interesting or thematic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Extreme Worker Placement.   

Man, this is a stressful game!  It seems like your back is up against the wall every single turn, while you manage what little resources and actions you have in order to scrounge together a few points here and there.  Perhaps this is due to unfamiliarity still, having only played twice, but it sure seems like there's is a plethora of things to do and only a fraction of the time needed to do them in.  The wheel spins slowly enough (one notch per round), and yet before you know it, you're frantically trying to make sure your workers can be fed, or attempting to get some influence in a temple before the scoring round begins!   

More plays are needed to fairly and more accurately assess this unique and interesting (but tiring and Brain burning) title.  For now, based on production values and originality, I give it a 7.5.     

EDIT:  After more than 5 plays over the past few months, with 2, 3, and 4 players, I'd say this is just above an 8 rating for me.  Simply put, it's gone from being just a good game, to bordering on great.  Perhaps staying power will push it into the 8.5 or even 9 rating.  For now, I'll settle at 8.25.

Overrated game. Very standard game of cube conversion. The gears mechanic adds no depth to the game, it's essentially a small extension to the mechanic in O&L. The game needs to do more with the gears, such as adding gears mid-game, rotating both ways, or spending energy to rotate gears (depending on the size of gears and the gears linked to it)

RATING: 9
Excellent euro with a truly unique mechanic. Before getting to that there are many things that are not new, resource collection, multiple paths to VP, and worker placement. The game is surprisingly simple to explain, the rules are not complex however the game play is full of calculation and hard decisions centred around which actions are best to select and how best to plan your moves.

The unique mechanic is the gear which pushes workers placed to new actions each round. Your turn is very simple, either place workers or remove them and perform the action they are standing at. The gears move each round which moves your workers to different actions. Each of the 5 gears has a different class of action to perform, e.g. collect resources, collect money (corn), build/technology. 

There is player interaction in several places. Of course worker placement but also the game is a bit contrarian as there are three potentially large sources of points (temples, skulls, monuments) and paying close attention to the actions of the others is important.

The game has great tension from lack of actions and time to do everything. You really have to make sure you're ambitions are realistic. We've found that the game actually plays in about 90min as written on the box making this pretty fast and very enjoyable. The fun/time ratio is much higher than expected.

There's a lot going on in the Mayan Calendar. Be prepared to spend a few hours with it when you have AP prone comrades around. At least, you're spending these hours for a game that manages to do something new in boardgaming with the much discussed gears. What they manage to do is introducing duration as a strategic dimension of playing. The longer you stay with an action the better it gets. This stems from the possibility to either place workers or remove them in your turn. A decision which has been featured in a few worker placement games before but the first time as prominent as here. Secondary to this, there are multiple dimensions fueled by the gears. Money represented by corn has to be managed, an engine building part is plugged on, there's a race for the highest position on three pyramids and various victory point or ability granting buildings can be bought. Enough opportunities for gamers to indulge into the depth generated by the hundred small parts. It's a competently developed and finetuned game which I enjoyed but don't love. The depth is too much complexity driven for my liking and the necessary invest is high for the enjoyment payout provided. It's one of the games where I see myself struggling whenever I play this and never coming to a satisfactory level of play. It's in good company with Stone Age, Goa and Puerto Rico.

This rating is after two plays. I really enjoy this game but penalize it at least a point for the endgame. The ability to double-turn the gears to end the game a turn earlier makes that last part of the game too swingy. For a game that requires so much careful planning, I found this end of game variability to not match with the rest of the game. This game also suffers from the mechanic of only being able to choose to be first in turn order and thus players can benefit from seating position relative to those fighting over turn order.

I was slightly disappointed with this game. as I thought the gear mechanic would play differently. As it stands, the gear mechanic is just a way to automatically advance workers along tracks to get better stuff.

This is a fav with our gaming group, but we don't often play as a couple.  However, it does play well with Two players.  I will say though that if you have a corn hogger in your gaming group it does not play well, because unless you hog corn as well and buy into the upper slots of the gears like they do, YOU WILL LOSE every time.  But we still love it.  Great to have a worker placement that adds the component of time. I will continue to strive to elucidate a strategy that beats corn hogging.

AMAZING!  Wasn't really sure this game would live up to all the hype, but it did for us!  Really enjoy the simplistic basis (put workers on OR take them off) that has amazingly deep, brain-burning potential.  Dealing with time (how many turns down the road do I need to be pulling that worker off) is surprisingly difficult at first and it makes the game fascinating!

Such an intense and well thought out game. I love just how strategic you have to be, trying to plan moves well in advanced just to hit a combination that shoots you up in the victory point track. It's very difficult, yet very satisfying to get those moments.

Update: After playing it more, I decided I'm not as big of a fan of it, especially at full 4 players. It is still a good game, but I've cooled on it.

The new mechanic here is the aging of your meeples to get better actions.  Sort of like the Ora & Labora aging except that the result is more versatile.  The gears do a good job of implementing this mechanic without too much overhead.

Complementing this new mechanic is several technology tracks, several victory point tracks, buildings, and end game monuments.

The new mechanic is interesting.  The question is if the rest of the complementary parts are well put together for a lasting and replayable game.

Probably too restrictive for us, just like Agricola. I like this game way more than Agric, but you are farming for corn the entire game in order to feed your people, but you also need to spend that very same corn for play your workers. That being said, there is a fantastic game here, we just suck at it.

At first glance it seems to be much more mathematical and complicated than it is. It's also not living only through it's cool gimmick, but is actually a cool and good worker placement game that borrows heavily on Caylus' tracks and offers a wide variety of strategies to try. Could be AP prone at times, but I was also positively surprised by the generally low amount of AP and how quickly it plays.

I wish I liked this one, but I just can't wrap my head around the wheels' turning, mess up my planning, and this becomes Frustration in a box. To play this, I'd need half an hour and paper to plan my stuff ahead, and that's fun for no one.

Very well designed, complex euro. Feels more like a logic game than leading a tribe (Stone Age, for example, gives the better feeling). Annoying action of unlimited exchange of each and every resource without any fees at all. There should be some restrains to make this action less powerful at the later stages of the game.

Not the most heavy gamerules, but the game is very tense...A lot of choices to make in very short time..And that isn't all, there's Always the pressure that someone will fasten up the game by rotating 2 times...Great game and not because of the rondels...

RATING: 6
There's no shortage of games where you figuratively spin the gears of a resource and action procuration layer, investing the proceeds in efficiency increases, one-shot bonuses and, sooner or later, victory points. Tzolk'in distinguishes itself by providing actual wheels to spin your pieces into a resource and action procuration timescape, although the investment part seems to offer little new. I like it better than, say, Stone Age, but more play is needed to deterine how much. "Count backwards from the end" syndrome features on long and short time scales, alleviated by a bit of multiplayer chaos.

A sprinkling of Stone Age and Ora et Labora, with a surprisingly gentle learning curve. The group of three strangers whom I played this with and I picked it up after a fifteen-minute rules summary without a problem, even though it looks daunting at first. I can see why this was one of the most touted games at BGG.con - it's really engaging and tricky, with some of the family-feeding stress of Agricola with a slightly easier target, and the strategies are varied as the starting materials (which can give you more actions, more stuff, more abilities, all while maintaining a pretty astounding level of balance). 

I'll definitely buy this when I get a chance. It's almost made for a computer emulation on boiteajeux or boardgamearena. I'm a pretty big fan and I'm looking forward to giving it another shot.

2014-10-19 - Very good worker placement. It took us quite long to play, but three out of four didn't know too much what to do during first third, or half of the game. It's quite heavy for me and moving gears don't help, but I want to play again.

2015-01-03 - 8->8,5 - I like it a lot. It takes time to be able to see what is going on on the board and to exactly know how to achieve certain goals. I played with Trbes, which are great, but didn't try prophecies yet.

2015-10-19 - I don't play this one often enough. It's not as long as I thought. An hour and a half with a little bit experienced players is really enough.

2017-06-02 - 8,5->9 - I played with prophecies and they are as good as tribes. It's my favourite heavier eurogame.

Hogy milyen a játék? Szerintem briliáns! Brutálisan sok lehetőség van benne. Az alapmechanizmus szinte pofátlanul egyszerű. Vagy el kell helyezned egy (vagy több) munkást valamelyik fogaskeréken, vagy fel kell venned őket. Ennyi. 
Hogy közben élelmiszert takarítasz be, nyersanyagot termelsz ki, kereskedsz, építkezel, technológiát fejlesztesz, gyarapítod a munkásaid számát, kristálykoponyákra hajtasz, vagy esetleg keresed az istenek jóindulatát, az már csak rajtad múlik.
Ami a legszebb az egészben, hogy nincs egyértelműen legjobb taktika. Bár valószínűleg véges a győzelemhez vezető optimális kombinációk száma, azért nem csekély lehetőségről van szó. Bár nincsenek direkt konfliktusok a játékosok között, azért egymás bábui befolyásolják a stratégiák alakulását.
A játék 12-es karikás. Én lehet, hogy még magasabbra raknám, vagy inkább úgy fogalmaznám meg, hogy nem árt némi társasjátékos előképzettség hozzá. Elmélyülésre képes középiskolásoknak sima ügy. Persze egyénfüggő, biztosan lenne olyan gyerek, aki 10 évesen is tudná élvezni. Azért alapvetően inkább felnőtt játéknak mondanám. És bár nem állítom, hogy ezen az oldalon (BGG) elért pontszámok, értékelések szentírások, de ha egy játék kb. 2-3 évvel a megjelenése után a több tízezer játék közül a 16. helyen áll úgy, hogy ebben a pillanatban 10198 szavazat alapján 8.00/10 a pontszáma, azért az mégiscsak jelent valamit... Nem?

Great worker placement game, you really need to plan your future moves and the pace of the game doesn't have much downtime per player.

Another no-luck, full information worker placement game (well, technically some building cards are added during the game). On the plus side Tzolk'in looks great and has multiple paths to victory and so on. On the negative side the game is long, static, surprisingly forgiving (there are several rules to make sure you can't get hosed or have trouble timing how the wheels move) and it doesn't really develope during its lengthy playing time so you'll feel like you're doing the same thing over and over again. The gimmick (wheels) doesn't really add anything, altough it does make the game tiny bit less fiddly as you don't need to manually move each worker along a path as you do in other similar games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.95
Fascinating game that adds the 4th dimension as a resource!(?) So many paths to victory, so many outs and options available. Slightly prone to AP as you peer into the future trying to grok future-you's strategy, but a great game for heavy thinkers. Nicely done theme with good graphics. Manual has great examples. Did I mention you get to play with a clockwork game board?

A heavy game for us. We enjoy the game, but after we finished our first game, we feel tired. Not because the game is bad , but because there are so many things we have to think.

with more plays we play this game faster.
The decision making to win the game. And the combo from buildings are making this game interesting.

Love it!  It's easy to play, but extremely hard to master IMHO.  The games are very different depending on what monuments and buildings come out and who you're playing with.  Lots of replay with this, and it's just really well thought out!  And the gears are c00l (had to throw that in).

05-05-2014 - Don't get me wrong, I love this game.  But it's just not the same anymore after so many plays.  I'll still play this any time, but down to a 9.5.

Once the symbology is understood which can be initially overwhelming, it's relatively simple to play, put workers or collect workers, yet offers numerous strategies and can result in brain burn trying to balance resource collection and food collection whilst still ultimately working towards earning victory points.

This is a good worker placement game, but be warned that it will make you think.  You actually have to thing through where your next turn will be once the gears have turned.  A great idea and way more than just a gimmick.  Now if I can only get my wife to paint the gears.

The heart of this game is a retread. Get stuff and cash it in for points, choosing to specialize in this or that. 

The end-game scoring tiles seem like they could make the game better, by presenting different areas of specialization that are clearly better than others but I don't see the conflict that comes from that making an entire game interesting. 

The gears are neat but unessential. The timing decisions they introduce are sometimes interesting but all in all I think for a game that packs about as much punch as something like Stone Age you've got alot of rules investment for a lean payoff, relative to other games. A solid 7 "JASE" masquerading as something more than it is, and that added complexity makes me lower the rating to a 6. A game I'll play without protest at least a few more times but I'd be trading it if I bought it.

It's not just a gimmick, this game is quite well designed.  The game moved faster for my play than I was expecting at the outset.  The people who do not enjoy Agricola, because of the stress probably won't enjoy this one, but I like Agricola and I like this game as well. This game has great style, with a nice board with bright colors (oh, and some neat gears).

Designing worker placement games these days is pretty much like choosing modules to play with, out of different expansions to the same old base. Tzolk'in is no exception, but the execution is good.

My overall feeling is very much on the positive side, though the wheel mechanism is the only original thing in this one, and player interaction is limited to little blocking and the current starting player's once-in-game option (twice if you reach the top step of a temple) to move the wheels two cogs ahead.

Excellent resource game, played 3 times and it has got better with each play.
Update to above - - - and a demotion in rating.
Played a lot on-line 2-player where the fun has been sucked out of it by a winning strategy of food exchange. this then has changed it from a game of calculated placement to just monopolising the bottom wheel, thought is not required.

RATING: 7
A neat worker placement game with interesting components. The game runs quick, easy to keep track of everything and overall a pleasant experience. 

The only reason I sold it was because of the dominance of 1 strategy in high level play (though I haven't reached such level). The game can also be intimidating to casual gamers. It's hard to suck them into the game when they don't know what they are doing (and it can easily take 30+ plays to actually understand and be able to evaluate how each action is worth in the game imo).

Damn, I'm sure it's a well-developed game but it was such a letdown...

However cool it looks, it's a very typical excel sheet game, manipulating columns with values until you get the most points possible.

As for the wheels: as a mechanism, they are columns made more usable. They are simply spectacular forms of columns (the game would also work if you pushed each worker down by one in a column at the end of each turn). So I don't call this a very interesting mechanism, even though it's more usable than columns and looks cool.

So what is the interesting part of the mechanism? To me, it's that you EITHER put some workers there OR you take your workers off (and do the actions). This is interesting. But that's it.

The rest is something you can expect from an Agricola- and Caylus-loving designer. Nothing really new: familiar ideas (favor track from here, feeding your workers from there, building boring buildings, going up some tracks that score you points and give some in-game benefits), multiple ways to win, also I'm sure it's well-balanced, only... I just felt I don't really care.
Besides the lack of interesting ideas, what I really missed was some sense of theme here. You get different looking markers but this game is not more thematic, than, say, Keltis. Agricola has lots of theme. Caylus has theme and cool mechanism ideas. Goa has a great central mechanism. Even Shipyard has a lot more theme and moving your ships on the river. For this complexity a game needs some more theme to remain interesting and entertaining.

The visual gimmick is nice, the rest is just not outstanding for me in any way. Probably it's only because it's not really my favorite subgenre (although I love all the games mentioned above), but I expected more.

Played twice, 4p.  Good - not great.  I think this game has gotten more attention than it deserves, since it doesn't really do anything new, but it does some old things (worker placement, resource management) in a new way.  The gears are not just a gimmick, though - they are essentially a timer for the workers.  Good to play more, but I'm not completely convinced it has staying power.

An excellent Euro-game with a good theme (Mayan calendar civilization) where "timing" (pun intended) is important.  The wheels and gears are not a gimmick and is a very interesting and innovative game mechanism that fits the theme.  I would suggest on your first play: not to over-diversify.  There are many paths to victory and I think if you try to do too much of everything, you probably won't achieve high results (victory points).

There is a fair bit of planning ahead and making sure not to make any mistakes in that planning in this game.  Gears look cool and are probably a bit more than a gimmick.  At its heart, this game is pretty straightforward worker placement that one should be able to plan ahead fairly well.  Someone can rotate the wheel twice which can thwart or throw a wrench into your plans however.  Game still left me feeling a bit underwhelmed, but I'll be happy to play my friend's copy again to see if the game improves in repeat plays.  I certainly hope I will improve in how I play this game!

If the objective of the design was to simulate the slow, relentless grind of the gears of a clock ticking down inexorably towards apocalypse then "well done chaps" you've succeeded.

My first play of this one made me want to play again right away, after my second play I still felt very positive toward this game. After a third play I felt a pattern emerge, and every game since has felt very similar, with very little differentiation in strategy (from me or my opponents). The expansion added a bit of variety, but felt unbalanced, at least to a casual player like me. 
With the expansion I would add a single point to the score (6.5/10)

RATING: 5
There's a lot to like here. Aesthetically, it's just a neat looking game, with the crazy cool gears in the middle. The gears provide a neat twist on worker placement, where you can let a worker ride around and take more valuable actions (also I like how you can place or remove workers at will, instead of the usual all-or-nothing in WP.) It's also a plus that it has a moderately novel theme (honestly, Mayans and Egyptians and Polynesians and such can all be lumped into the same "pagan barbarians" category) that the gear attempts to work with (as sick as I am of steampunk and such, I see those big gears and think Fritz Lang's Metropolis and wouldn't that have been kind of cool!) 

With so much to like, naturally it doesn't really excite me that much. It reminds me a lot of Trajan, in that if you step away from the novel mechanic, you're left with the same old tired Eurogame junk. Get resources. Advance on this track. Build buildings. Feed workers. It doesn't feel particularly Mayan or anything, really, just more of the same. So I'm left rating a single mechanism, not a game. As a mechanism the gears are neat. The approach to worker placement is really nice, and a promising development. Figuring out how to play the gears is interesting, to a point (far more interesting than fiddling with that Trajan mancala.) I just wish the freshness extended beyond the gears, because the mundanity of everything else about Tzolkin nearly overpowers the novelty.

I do not care much for worker placement games.  As one critic once said, "They're soulless."  There's a common formula to worker placement games, then just slap a theme on there and make a few adjustments to the formula so it fits your needs and originality.  Tzolk'in takes everything I just said and throws it out the window.  The only reason I don't give this a 10, is because I'm not a fan of worker placement games.  For starters, this game is beautiful.  It has a gorgeous board that is lush with color.  The artwork does a good job of tying everything together.  

There were four of us playing and I came in dead last.  It was my first time playing so there's a lot to wrap your head around, but this game is just so incredibly well thought out.  I have to laugh when someone says the gears on the game board are a gimmick.  No, that's a very unique, functional mechanic of the game.  Rest assured, it's no gimmick.  This game requires foresight and plenty of silent mental planning that can easily be thwarted when a gear your worker is on suddenly moves farther than you considered.  

These ideas of burning down a forest to get to the corn as well as angering the gods in the process is far beyond clever, and that's just one of several aspects in this game.  Constructing buildings and monuments, moving up the temple tracks and collecting (and utilizing) crystal skulls round out some of the other major things to do in the game.  I have no idea how someone sat down and said "I want to create this Mayan-themed game that does this, this and this," but they did, and did so beautifully.

Good thick cardboard tiles quality.
Instead of well designed resources there are just cubes.
The skulls and the board are very nice designed.
Corn are cardboard tiles, but it is ok, normally it is a currency and cardboard "money" is ok.

Game is a bit hard for casual players in our group.
That means not the rules are difficult, but in the game there many options and you need to think about it.
What makes the game so strange, is the forward planning and waiting for a reward from your workers.

It can be a bit long, dry and boring.

I would prefer to play the base game only with house rules, variants, which fixed some problems and only with the expansion.

Tzolk'in has a unique gear mechanic that as time passes the workers move to better spots.  On your turn you can add workers to the board or take them off but not both.  There are myriad of different tracks and ways to win.  It is a reasonably heavy game.  

I like it a lot and it is an excellent game.  Although it is so heavy, at times, I don't feel like playing.  But I will rarely turn it down as it is good.  

Not a family weight game, it is a gamers game.

Very interesting game with a nice theme and a lot of room for developing strategies. After 4 plays I have not realised which strategy is the best, but for each game I make better moves. The only backside to the game is some lacking player interaction. Of course, each player is affected greatly by the other players' moves, but making a move just to affect someone else is way too expensive. So I wonder if this game - though extremely interesting - isn't in the end a 4 player solitaire with everchanging conditions.

Yeah the gears are a little gimicky but really it's better than moving a bunch of individual pieces along tracks. Just twist one piece and everything moves on the tracks automatically. 

Neat twist on the worker placement games as the longer you keep a worker in place the better the results will be. You still have to take care as to your timing because you can't take a workers actions and place workers in the same turn so you might miss a specific action you want to take and have to spend a little extra food or time to get it.

There are several different things to put your mind to in this one as well. I'm not sure if one route or the other is better or not though but time will tell.

I was a bit sceptical about the wheel, but it's really a great aide in what would otherwise be a cumbersome time-mechanic.  I've really come to enjoy this game purely due to it's multiple paths to victory - it can be quite strategic because specialization is encouraged.

If you like lots of decisions, multiple paths to victory, and a game that lasts less than 2 hours then this is the game for you. Really fun to play. The gear mechanics are brilliant and really interesting to plan for. After one play I'm hooked, can't wait to play this game again.

Based on 1 play. Very enjoyable worker placement game that promises a great deal of replayability, since there are evidently numerous paths to victory. Balancing your various requirements leads to interesting decisions every turn, and the wheel mechanism is thematically, mechanically and aesthetically a nice focal point.

RATING: 8.5
The gears are not just a novelty; although their effect could have been emulated with just a regular game board, this would have been so fiddly that people would have dismissed the game.

This is a genuine innovation in the worker-placement genre, and it lacks the feeling of sameness that plagues games such as Egizia.

Timing is important, more-so than in other games in the genre. The fact that you have to choose each turn between placing workers, or getting their benefit, means that you have to consider carefully how often you do either.

[Played 1 time]

A well executed mix of typical "worker placement" and "resource management" aspects.
It totally lacks anything innovative (the cogs are just a gimmick for workers moving along tracks).
I am also not a fan of having so many resources just for the sake of converting ones into others (to gain bonuses that improve such ratios and so on).

Ten years ago I'd have liked it more. Nowadays, I feel that I won't miss anything by never playing it again (and albeit I won't oppose if it is requested, I'm surely not going to propose it).

1st play last 2P vs the wife. WOW! is this a fantastic game. Granted there were a few rules she and I goofed, a couple of them we corrected mid-game. On the whole though, the game was close. Normally she makes a good lead on me in Euro games and maintains them until the end. By the second to the last turn, I managed to drop a couple of crystal skulls to amass enough points for a mere 5 point loss instead of a 15 point deficit. 

Need/Want more plays with more players.

RATING: 8
Worker Placement with a twist - 5 cogs (wheels) connected to a central cog (wheel) - Place your workers on one or more of the small cogs and at the end of your turn the big cog moves which of course moves all the little ones - on your turn you MUST either be placing a cog/cogs or removing a cog/cogs - the long you ride the cog the better the resources / abilities you get.
Many routes to scoring points

>> 2 plays. 

We are grokking this more and more. Can't wait for the next. 

A little concerned about crystal skulls with two players but we will see. Expansion on the way and hopefully this will help to fix that up.

>> 5 plays

Interdependencies of the actions are becoming more clear and games are speeding up. 

Love the feeling of preparing for and executing a mega-turn.

Rating based on one play. First impression: wow, this is fun! Lots of paths to take, and properly managing your workers is a fun challenge. Will probably play this a lot in the near future and rating might well go up. 

Update: now played three times. The worker placement/retrieval mechanism combined with the turning gears give this a unique feeling. The rest of the game is rock-solid and a lot of fun in my opinion. Still looking for a way to beat the crystal-skull-strategy though, but I'm getting closer!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting variant on worker placement games due to the cog mechanic; you can choose between using a worker now or using them on a later turn. Not quite a classic due to: (1) it's hard to switch strategies mid stream (2) in a 4p game, the player picking the strategy no other player goes for often wins (3) some strategies are much more interesting and fun to play than others. Still very good though.

has a catchy gimmick that is implemented well
worker placement plus strategic timing
simple rules for how much is going on
The one rule that was hard to follow was when taking the first player token, when the day changes.  I think for all that this game has, us having a hiccup on just one rule tells how easy it is to understand
Good gameplay pace for not having interactive player turns.
the game looks great besides the stone, wood, and gold.  Those cubes are way too close in color.

we played with three and the other players I was with felt like the game wasn't long enough, a specific red flag was that noone got any monuments.  But I think thats exactly how it should have gone as over half of the skulls were placed, and one person did have the amount of resources for a monument.  I think that shows we were new but also speaks to 4 being the optimum number to feel the game would be the right speed.

RATING: 9
Cool looking material, original wheel mechanism for "timed" worker placement and well constructed game mechanics.  

Long down-time? Definitely! Do you need more than 2 plays to understand how to get control over this game, yes you do (at least I do).

In the beginning, this game is pure frustration. Running behind the facts, concentrating on food to feed your workers, and making sure you put your workers to work soon enough, so you can harvest from your investment on the longer term.

The moving wheels mechanism makes me think of [thing=55670][/thing]. But this game is not about cards. Timing is everything, and also, you need to make sure that you don't get lost in all the options you have. In that sense this game belongs to the same category as [thing=104006][/thing], but then [thing=104006][/thing] can be seen as the lighter version of Tzolk'in.

So is this a game you should play? Sure! If all the players know the game and know what they are doing, this could be a fun game. But until you all get there ... 

Then the question is, is it all worth the investment (2-3 hours play) ? The game is certainly not boring. There is a lot going on and a lot to think about. The best planner will definitely win this game. And if not, it will be because of the buildings.

Having said all that, once you have played this game a few times, you start wondering how you could do better. So let me conclude this game's fun, lies in the sleepless nights you have after a few defeats, thinking which extreme strategy is going to bring you victory next time.

And if you don't mind cheating, you can read about the best strategies on BGG. But then it becomes more of a study of the best opening move and stuff like that. And that is where, I give up. When a game needs study to play it well, it's no longer a game, it's an exam.

It would be higher, but the Resource to Building strategy is too strong in our opinion. The expansion didn't solve this issue and I do not understand how adding prophecies would solve that. It might have solved the "best" first move problem, but that's it.

RATING: 7
The gears are innovative, for sure.  It takes some foresight to plan your moves.  The gears also make this fairly thematic, as far as worker placement games go, since your workers have to invest time to produce better results.  However, once you get a good feel for timing, do the decisions you make each game become much simpler?  Seems like it would, but I'll have to play more to find out.

Too tight and too tough.  I don't like games where you just barely scrape by and don't have enough to do much good.  Looks awesome, and the mechanics of placing people to be plucked up later, and trying to time things right is all cool, but it just seems like that probably had a great game on their hands and they had to cinch it up tighter until you can just barely get by.

This is one solid game. Is looks great, it has an awesome rotating-gears mechanic, and the sheer geniality of it is that mechanic-wise, you actually have to choose from placing workers or removing them and taking the associate action. That's it. It's that simple. This is great because it lets you focus on the strategic part of the game exclusively. There is no "what actions do I have available?Am I allowed to do that?"

An innovative worker placement mechanism, surrounded by familiar elements from the best euro games such as Caylus (technologies), Agricola (food day), Puerto Rico (monuments), Hamburgum (making an action further from your position by paying)etc. There are many ways to victory, you have a lot of choices, it has high replayability. The board and the components are beautiful and all symbols are clear! A must have for any eurogamer!

RATING: 5.5
This is not the typical worker-placement game. This is not the typical cube-pushing game. This is not the typical VPs-salad game or VP-engine game - in fact very few actions grant VPs. 

Tzolk'in is a very solid, thoughtful and deep design. The gears mechanic is more than just a gimmick; it's very essential to the game. It represents the timely placement of your workers in order to be effective. Because of that and the absence of virtually any luck, the best and more experienced player will always win. I don't think that the learning curve is very steep, but you need a few plays to really appreciate the depth of the actions in order to use them in your favor (i.e. in a coherent way). 

Arguably, Tzolk'in is one of the best worker-placement games out there. If you like this mechanic, then you must own this game. But then, "why the low rating?" you might ask. Because, although I can appreciate its design, it just isn't my type of game. It's not fun. It feels more like an exercise. I also have to add that the end-game is quite anti-climactic. In all our games it was obvious who would win at least 3-4 rounds before the end.

Fun worker placement game with an odd twist.  Unlike other games, you can leave your players on the turning wheels until you get to a particular outcome for the player piece.  You have to plan ahead and hope that the other players don't decide to jump ahead and move the wheel two turns!
I enjoyed this game and played it at BGG.Con 2012.  I might eventually get this one but for now I'm happy having played it once.  If it ever gets brought to the table by another player I'll gladly join in.

Only ONE of the satellite gears has a different number of teeth? What a wasted opportunity. You could have everything moving at different rates, but all they do instead is move one notch each turn, and the "tracks" are different in length. The gears still help, but it could've been more.

Not something I will get to play a lot, due to its length. But it is incredibly detailed and interesting all the way. Every decision is exciting, from the first to the last. And it has this nice "I want to do everything, but I'm constantly screwed and can't do shit!" feeling that just adds the right amount of frustration and tension. It's prone to analysis-paralysis though, which is why the game is so long when playing with my friends, as we are all total sinners of this.

Standard "I would study it as much as I would play it" game. Even people who have played it a bit said they still haven't really figured out strategies so they keep trying different things. Depending on how much prep time you get before playing, you'll likely take a mulligan on your first play and just try to learn how to play it as best as you can. From a design point it is top notch, but I don't see playing this outside of the local meet ups and Cons. It isn't really something I would ask to play either. With eventually having LoW, Agricola, and Yedo, I don't see where this fits in. Again, a very good and solid game. I'll even stick it into my Top 10 for now. It just won't stay there long term.

First played at GLG 2012. The gears are visually stunning and not gimmicky; they're integral part of managing the complex & changing game state over time.  There's a real game behind them.

I like this game a lot, although I'm not very good at it. You need to plan ahead several turns, but there is still the uncertainty of what your opponents might do. This creates the tension and the need to adjust your plans (which I like).

Played three times. I really like this with reasonably fast players. With AP-people it can really drag. When I first read about the game it sounded like worker placement with a gimmick, but the wheels actually add something to the genre.

Bought from BGG Marketplace (Local) 3/4/16.

I love how the game uses time as an actual resource.  The wheels aren't just a gimmick; they really do create a whole new level of strategy.  It does take some time to learn how to play effectively.  The only other game that I end up thinking about so much is Terra Mystica.

Good variable starting resources and buildings.  Base game suffers from requiring everyone to go temples. 

The expansion makes this even better.

---
Update 3/17/16.  Rating changed from 8 to 8.5.  We've played this every day this week (5 plays over 5 days).  The depth of strategy is similar to Terra Mystica, which means that I constantly want to play it.  Play time is 30 - 45 min, meaning it's perfect for mid-week quickies.

Update 5/6/16.  Rating increased from 8.5 to 9.  I still constantly want to play this.  I don't get to as much as I want to, and I've really been feeling it.

highly rated for a reason. While the gears seem innovative, it's not too different from any other worker placement mechanic that might take a few turns to pay off for instance. 

It's fun, there are many options, things are always tight. The only letdown for me seems to be the monuments - those who know the power of the end game scoring there will win every time.

Like the mechanics, love the challange, however, I feel that there are a bit unbalansed strategies! Religion track is unbalanced for two players, but it is fine for more players. However, dummy players works well if you don't concentrate on God tracks

However, with expansion this game is amazing, so much replayability and differences between games!

This immediately grabbed us and didn't let go. Worker placement is not even our favourite mechanic but these cogs are just deliciously clever and fun to play with. 

The "ebbs and flows" feeling of placing and displacing your workers is very satisfying once you get the hang of it, and there's even a second layer on top of that, coming from the 4 feeding turns and the related bonuses from the gods you'll strive for in preparation to them. It just flows beautifully.

I'm pretty sure we'll play this a lot more and the rating might even rise a bit more. Fantastic game!

This rating could go up or down.  I'm quite enjoying the game, and it hits a lot of points that I enjoy in games: multiple paths to victory, indirect interaction, puzzle aspects, etc.  At this point, however, none of are games have been close so it can be a bit frustrating for the losing player.  Also, the end can be a bit anti-climatic...

03/02/13 Played a three-player game. 
The rotating gears were clever, but they alone aren't enough to make this game stand out among the raft of worker placement games. Adding in the severe analysis paralysis it caused means I'm not too keen on playing it very often. Though I'm glad I got to try it. 
06/01/13 Played another three-player game. It took less time, but the analysis paralysis factor is still a big factor.

Beautiful board and a set of interlocked gears make for a unique worker placement game. Easy to play after a single game, but... very hard to master. Unless you are totally AP the game turns are quick and so down time is minimal. 

Be careful when introducing the game, as players can do lots of "busywork" - turns that look like actions, but make no points. This may leave new players feeling frustrated.

Solid worker placement game. The wheels are new, otherwise nothing revolutionary. Multiple roads to victory, need to play more to explore this game further. So far I am impressed, challenging. Rating may be adjusted later.

Update: upgraded. Remains rather solitary, but lots of variation depending on your starting tiles and on available buildings and monuments. The wheels already offer lots of options. Challenging game. Decide upon your strategy at the start based upon available monuments and starting tiles in your hand. Every action counts.

RATING: 8
Okay - let me state straight away that I think Tzolk’in is, in all probability, an excellent game. I love worker placement; I love bits that interact; I love difficult decisions in games… I had, to a point, a really good time playing it. … However, I have issues with the game, most of which are not to do with the game itself, but more to do with how I operate.

 Tzolk’in, if you haven’t heard of it, is a game based on quite thorough research of the Maya Calendar, its Long Cycle, Short Cycle and the various periods which make up those (I’d be interested to know if the different cogs have numbers of teeth which equate to the various short periods which make up the numerous elements, but as I couldn’t remember what those period numbers were, I couldn’t check). 

In essence, it’s a worker placement game (yay!, my favourite (not joking)), but with a twist: the main mechanism consists of a series of interlocking cogs which are an active part of the board. By active, I mean that the board itself affects your decision making, and it will change, not necessarily to your liking, dependent on player actions. For the most part, you could regard the board action as predictable, but you can’t guarantee it.

 On their turn, players have one choice: place workers and pay the cost for placement; or remove workers and receive the benefit which results from their board positions. Players may not combine placement and removal - it is either/or, in a similar fashion to The Manhattan Project. The number of actions is limited by how many workers the player chooses to place or remove and, in the case of placement, whether the player has enough food to pay for the placement.

 Once each player has taken their actions the turn has one last phase, which is for the interlocking wheels to rotate, thus moving all the workers to new spots where you may or may not like the benefits. 

Now, I don’t want to spend too much time describing how the game works because there’s far too much going on in this game (FAR too much) for me to describe it adequately in less time than the game plays. (Maybe you can do that, but I can’t, or am not willing to. If you know me, you know what I mean and shall be thankful; or if you’re just browsing this, then you have to take it as read that, really, this is the easier option and you can all thank whatever god you pray to, or just shrug your shoulders and live-and-let-live.) Instead, try to imagine someone making a design decision to combine Caylus with Mousetrap (slightly facetious of me) and a funky mechanical version of the card-shifting function in Through the Ages… but you only get cards for which you have placed a worker on a previous turn…

 Yes, it sounds shit when I explain it like that, but then I try not to compromise when it comes to quality.

 So, here we are, with the genius of the game: the rotating actions/costs/benefits; which also happen to be, in my case, its downfall… or should I say, in everyone else’s case, should I happen to be one of the players. The problem is this: I have a problem. I am not a linear thinker. I do not absorb rules by reading the rule book and knowing what happens. I absorb rules by practical experience, by iteration and re-iteration, and I communicate my experience in the same fashion. I think this is a function of my employment - for more than twenty years, I have worked in an industry which demands prioritisation: thinking is cyclical and rewards an approach which discards everything but the most important and immediate event and its effect, then, once that event and effect is processed and accommodated, one can proceed to re-process the list of required events, select the most important, discard the others and work on the event required. This makes me quite successful in some game genres, especially those which are tactical rather than strategic.

The trouble with Tzolki’in is it requires assessment of the current, future and far future possibilities simultaneously, and my brain just doesn’t work like that. The result is that I suffer from an embarrassing - and almost debilitating - level of analysis paralysis.

Now, AP is not something that I find predictable. In many games, I don’t feel I suffer at all (though my wife would disagree); but there are some in which I brain freeze like I’ve swallowed a pint of Cherry Garcia. Of all the games I’ve encountered, Tzolk’in is the Primate (in the sense of first, rather than ape-like). And this is my problem with the game: if I’d been playing against myself (not solo, because solo games bore the hell out of me - I mean, who wants to play games which don’t involve other people - surely that’s the point?), I wouldn’t have felt so self-conscious. But from the first turn, I knew I would be the game’s problem and started apologising. This is a good game (gimmicky, yes, but still a good - and perhaps even great - game). I liked what it did. I REALLY liked how it did it; I loved the fact that the game principles can be communicated in a sentence, though it needs an in-depth explanation to give details of what that place-workers-or-remove-workers mechanism actually entails; I was excited and entertained by the novelty of worker movement.

What broke the game for me was ME: because I was so consciously aware of the time I was taking, as the game progressed I felt I was getting wearing for everyone else. Whether this was true or not is irrelevant (it’s true, by the way): it’s how I felt. This meant enjoyment for me decreased as the game progressed, and my ability to apply my analysis to the game diminished as my worry about how I was impacting others outside the gamespace began to crowd into my play.

 I won’t bore anyone else with further details, but suffice to say that this is the best and most interesting game I’ve played and which I’m unlikely to play again. I’m just too boring when I get like this. It’s no fun for anybody else, and it’s no fun for me when I know I”m affecting the enjoyment of others.

Seldom have I played a game when I’ve finished feeling so torn; and never have I played a game and finished feeling so psychologically aware of my own failings.

Make no mistake: this is a game I feel warrants extended play, and which I’m itching to play again, but I feel my inability to process its information quickly demands that I step away.

 I am very disappointed.

We have read the instructions and set up the gaming board.  The design looks solid and the gears look practical in addition to their bell and whistleness.  My wife loves the theme and has been to most of the ruins.  Now lets find out if it is any fun to play!

We both really enjoyed our first game.  The game moves along a lot quicker than I thought it would and I realized I had to be more judicious about what I hoped to accomplish.  I managed to succeed at my paired back monument plan in the last turn and get a large bonus.  The monuments remind me of the Big Buildings in Puerto Rico, but I like that they will be variable from game to game.  It seems like it will be important to choose an overall strategy each game that is in alignment with the available monuments.

Now lets see how the replayability of this game holds up.  Definitely looking forward to the next game.

I should also mention that this game is lighter than a lot of our other Euros.  My wife even proclaimed with bluster that this is a game we could play on a work night, but this is only in comparison to say Mage Knight or such.  I think calling it a work night game is a bit of an exaggeration, but this does mean that we can hopefully teach this to some of our friends/family who like games but are not as hard core as the two of us.

Update 1
We are playing our second game and there is really great strategy here.  The game is very elegant and even deeper than I initially thought.  Moved up to a 9.

Very easy to set up and the game runs itself so you can focus on playing.  Of course this only matters if playing is fun, which it is!

The gears are really cool. You place workers onto them. On a later turn you can remove workers from gears to receive resources or actions and the longer you've waited, the more the gears have turned increasing your awards. As great as that is I was a bit put off by how calculating the game is. You see, timing on the gears is crucial and each turn you must place or remove workers. So if you have no workers to place then you must remove at least one from the gears, perhaps not having received the resources you had hoped for. It might just take a couple of games to best understand the rhythm of the game.

My rating has gone up 1/2 a point after playing it 3-player. Seems to be the sweet spot as you can plan much better. You have a much better understanding of what the board/gears will look like when it comes back to your turn. Already in two games I've seen multiple paths to victory, although it's clear that the moving up on the temples is very important.

Going with a 7 initially. The wheel is more than a gimmick. Balancing placement and removal and limited workers is tricky. Balancing wheels and tracks is out of my reach after a single play but I hope to try again. It's too early to judge replayability.

Downgrade to a 3.5. I respect the mechanism but the calculation in this game robs it of all the fun. Besides, the entire point of the game is just to collect barely distinguishable resources to build arbitrary point buildings. It's just dry and terrible. No more. Will not play.

Great game but not for the faint of heart or casual play.  While sounding simple of either place or remove workers, there is a lot of planning and choices you can and have to make.  While this is good, it can overwhelm and mentally exhaust some players.  One of my favorite heavy worker placement games.

Main advantages over Agricola: Accomplishes most of the same mechanics in a smaller amount of tabletop space, with a much more interesting theme. (The trick to winning is praying to the gods early and often!) Main disadvantages over Agricola: No animeeples, and no endless amount of game customization via card decks.

Not a big fan of games that have such a clear path to solving them...I've seen the strategy of trading loads of goods in for food work too many times and I've never been inclined to try to figure out how to neutralize it.  Pity, considering I find the gear system rather innovative.

The spinning mechanism alone is worth the price of this magnificent game. BUT it is a bear to learn the first couple times. Play to learn the mechanic. Then...enjoy. So many interesting strategies.

RATING: 7.9
This game only made it to table once thus far, but what a game it is.  Big honking plastic cogs make up the center of the board and thus the mechanics are: the central calendar gear moves all the different-sized gears at different rates, each of which holds your worker placement and moves them around in sequence.  Your primary concern, after placement, is figuring out just what point to take the worker off - and the place they get removed determines what benefits you get. 

It has been a long while but the game took some getting used to, because it goes along the path towards the forest that IS Victory Point Salad - lots of weird crap to get used to, and try to prioritize, all while getting used to the delightful mechanical mechanics of the game.

A game I look forward to bringing to table again some time with the right group of people.

Despite looking like a game from the mid 90's, Tzolk'in really impressed me on first play. I liked the gear premise and the worker placement was easy to learn but difficult to master.

RATING: 7.5
Az akcióválasztás tényleg zseniális a rondellák miatt, a játék többi része viszont a "szokásos", jó "iparosmunka" kategória: munkáslehelyezős nyersanyag-menedzsment épületekkel, extra GYP-vel, többségi mechanizmussal (templomoknál). Ja, és a tábla is elég szép lett a fogaskerekekkel együtt. Plusz pont még a kezdeti stack randomizálása.

Nagy baja a játéknak, hogy az első negyed lepörgése után valaki hátrányba kerül és nem áll össze a "termelő gépezet", gyakorlatilag el is dőlt, hogy nem fog nyerni (mert a másik addigra már minden körben termel annyit, hogy szinte lehetetlen behozni a hátrányt).

Ezt eltekintve az egyedi mechanizmusa miatt valószínűleg sokszor elő fog kerülni, de kedvenc biztosan nem lesz soha.

A typical, by-the-books euro (get resources/build buildings/get VP on different tracks) dressed up with a very cool gimmick: the gears.

This is a game of timing and managing your resources (aren't they all?). Each turn consists of placing workers onto the board or taking them off of the board, that's it. The catch is that at the end of each round, all of the gears rotate 1 space, improving the rewards for removing the workers there. So it's a matter of jockeying for position and making sure you have the food to be able to place your workers and remove them at the right time. 

So the gears are eye-catching and have a definite toy factor to them, but they are also very, very interesting and central to the gameplay.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Interesting gimmick, but otherwise this is not particularly outstanding. Worker placement, resource management - nothing I haven't seen before. The time dynamic is interesting, sure, but otherwise the game's a tad fiddly. Also the game seems long. Big minus points for the glossy board, that looks so cheap compared to the gorgeous gears.

Indifferent.

Tzolk'in joins the vast array of games I'll play if someone else is interested, but I can't say I'd care one way or the other if I ever actually played it again. Yes, there are many interlocking (literally!) parts to consider, so you certainly won't be bored. But I just don't feel like it stands out all that much from the myriad other resource conversion and engine building games to really care whether I play it or something else. Keyflower, Hawaii, Hansa Teutonica, The Manhattan Project, and now Tzolk'in: they're all pretty much the same to me.

In principle this is a fairly easy game in mechanics: either you put a worker on one of the turning wheels or you remove one and execute the action attached to it. But which worker and when? And are you going to wait one more round? For me personally, I prefer this game above Terra Mystica.

The game really looks nice with the turning wheels that are more than a gimmick. It also plays nicely and faster with 2 players.

After playing a few times on BGA and once on the tabletop, my reaction is mild. The gameplay lacks focus and the game is too long for what it is.  The "feed your people" mechanic is really unwelcome, annoying and out-of-place. It is not an ever-present well-integrated part of the game (as it is in Agricola); instead it feels like something that comes around after many, many moves just to slap you in the face!  To me, T'zolkien feels too loose.

My another straight ten. Already in the first game we were completely hooked from the first moment. We missed a lot of opportunities to gather victory points but realized the potential and huge replay value of the game immediately. It is brain burning but above all it is completely immersive. It feels like the time slows down because when playing you don`t look at your watch but count the ticks of the gear as it inevitably turns towards the next feeding day.

Tzolk`in is currently the best Euro-game I have.

A fogaskerekes munkáslehelyezés és elvétel tényleg nagyon ötletes! Nem hasonlítható más általam játszott játékokhoz. Különleges megközelítést kíván, tényleg nem tudom eléggé dicsérni. Nagyon sok lehetőség közül lehet választani, és sok minden összefügg a táblán, ezért egy ügyes játékos remek kombókat alkothat, ami mindig kitűnő érzés.
Viszont gyakorlatilag az elején eldől minden. Ha valaki jól kezd, akkor könnyen behozhatatlan előnyre tehet szert, és a játék hosszát tekintve (2,5-3 óra négyen) ez szenvedés a többieknek. Engem nem is az zavar, hogy tudom, hogy nem nyerek, mert maga a fogaskerekes mechanizmus és a kombózás szórakoztat (hiszen nem a győzelem az elsődleges cél, hanem a szórakozás). De nagyon minimális az interakció, nem igazán lehet keresztbe tenni az ellenfelednek. Ebből következik, hogy a nyerésre álló játékost, nem lehet akadályozni, illetve, hogy óriási a holtidő a játékban. Gyakorlatilag érdektelen számomra, hogy mit csinál a másik, aki ráadásul, ha ügyesen feltápolta magát, hosszú óriáskombókba kezdhet, amit mind "magában pakolgat". Ez nem túl izgalmas.
Ja és még valami (bár ez legutóbb az én problémám volt..) Ha pont egy tapasztalt játékos után ül az ember (aki elég jól áll), nehéz helyzetbe tud kerülni: minden drágává válik, vagy kezdőjátékos leszel és akkor a 0-sra kell pakolni..
Sajnálom a dolgot, mert a mechanika remek, amit a saját körömben élvezek, viszont a hibák miatt, amikor nem én vagyok, rém unalmas; ebből pedig körönként 3 van.. Az interakció hiánya és a játék hossza sajnos eltántorít a további Tzolkinozástól.

OK.  Some parts of the game seem tightly woven (e.g. god's path and its connection with buildings and worker placement) while other parts are loose (Minimized path to crystal skull and full dial set aside just for placing the skull with it only impacting points and to lesser extent god path; technology path relevance (in terms of integration and impact with other parts of game) and the lack of incentive to allocate resources here; and the misc. dial with vary powerful actions without much wait (e.g. 1 free worker after 3 spins, buy building with corn after 4, and take any action from anywhere on board after 5 or 6 spins))

Components and art is par to sub-par.  As a worker placement game the dial turn does add a nice thematic complexity to decision making.

Having had a poor impression at a first play in Essen, I was persuaded to play it again..... And I am really glad I agreed.
This turns out to be one of the most unique worker placement games I have come across and the gears do make a real difference to the game and are not just a gimmick!
My only concern is that you shouldn't play this game with people who suffer from AP, due to the number of choices most of which you cannot decide upon until the previous player has completed their turn..... So beware!
Other than that....
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

A meatier Euro than it first appears, Tzolk'in makes use of gears that adds a real twist to the worker placement genre because the players not only have to place their workers, they know have to try and work out where they will end up in certain turns to trigger the effect they want to access. 

Problem with gears is that when one gear moves thanks to another player, it will move the other gears too and that can foul up your plans. 

This is slick design and well worth a look but it can be a little more mind bending than some Euro fans prefer. That was certainly the case for me but the innovative design also makes it a title that many a game collector will want to have in their collection.

Like others have stated, the gears on the board are NOT a gimmick, they work well to create interesting timing decisions.  But outside of that, this is just your typical worker placement / resource gathering / building / point scoring game.  Don't get me wrong, I do like it, but definitely don't need to own it.

As for the part of having to decide when to take your workers back or being forced to do so, that was already done in the Manhattan Project, and I like the theme of that game, and how it plays better (and I already own it).

Bottom line, very good game, but I'm on the fence on whether or not I should pick up my own copy.

Not on the fence anymore, I own it :)  After 10 plays I can confidently state, Great game!

While some aspects about the game feel familiar, the gears add something completely new and unique. It's not just gimmick, but adds a new style of gameplay. The rules and mechanics are simple to teach and learn, but chaining together meaningful moves takes practice and careful planning. Unlike most worker placement games, performing one needed action may take several turns. This makes the game brilliant. I also enjoy the balance and multiple paths to victory. The theme and components are great and add to this  overall amazing game.

RATING: 8
Perhaps my favorite worker placement game to date. There are so many paths to victory, and even though I suck at the game, I enjoy it every time I play. It's a game where the rules are fairly straight-forward, but the decision space is vast. I've heard that there are broken strategies, but honestly this seems to be mostly group-dependent. Usually whoever is the odd person out, meaning that they go for a different strategy than everyone else, tends to end up winning. This can be a plus or minus depending on who you are. The gears are a neat novelty, but it's really the brain-burning decisions that make Tzolk'in so great.

RATING: 5
Tzolk'in is most known for its innovative gears that automatically increase the workers' return the longer they stay on a gear. It's an elegant solution that poses to the players the challenge of return the workers early with a lower return or more often with a higher return. The return also requires a payment of corn and/or resources, something that you frequently find yourself lacking.

However, keeping track of all bonuses is more fiddly and it's not always obvious what the iconography means. In addition, it gets a bit repetitive after a while to send out and return workers with little sense of progress.

UPDATE - After playing Tzokin for more than 30 times in real life and BGA, I can safely say this deserves a 10. I tried all kinds of strateges and the game clearly shows that as long as you do it right, you can win. I am amazed at the balance of the game, and appreciate that it is not only the mechanics that held the game as one, but also players make a tremendous influence in how the game plays out.

Excellent game. Amazing iconography, and very well put-together manual. If you're into heavy Euros, get this guy. The theme is a bit... weird (I admit that I'm not a huge fan of Mayan lore in general), but totally worth it for the mechanics alone. Reminds me a lot of Terra Mystica (which I think it's superior to this game).

Solid game.  Rating would be higher barring my personal bias, but I am less enthusiastic over games that require the long term strategies needed in this game.  I am much more of a Tactical thinker and this game does not play to those strengths as much.  Still an enjoyable game.

This is a delightful brainburner! Manages to hit just the right level of difficulty for me. A lot to think about and consider, but doesn't get quite as stressful as Agricola, probably because you place your workers all at once instead of alternating with opponents. The gears are so much fun and are so cleverly connected with the theme.

One play revealed an elegant gameplay system that has lots of choice each turn. our novice play finished with 3 players within 1 point of each other indicating balance between different approaches, the use of corn as both a currency in the game and food for your workers really had us thinking of what to do each round.   We could all see different ways to improve our play for a next play.

RATING: 9
Players are Mayan tribes, placing workers on turning gears. Each round the gears rotate, and players must either remove workers to take their action, or place workers on gears. The further along the gear, the more valuable the action.

Each player is seeded with 4 wealth tiles, and you choose two of them. During the game, you need corn to feed workers, stone/wood/gold for buildings and monuments, and skulls for VPs. There are four different technology tracks to advance in, which give you benefits during the game. One also has to worry about being higher on a temple to ean VPs, so there is a lot going on here.

This game was one of the highest regarded at Essen 2012. I'm going to really enjoy discovering the many layers this game has to offer and I really look forward to more plays.

This game kicks my ass and I love it. Often find myself in complete failure, almost starving, and certainly never managing to get anything I wanted. Brilliant.

Although, to be honest, I wonder if the Monuments are a but underpowered. Every time I go for them, it ends in disaster. I think they are suppossed to be more sort of a 'sub plot' rather than the main goal, but they look and feel like they should be more important than they are. And the god track is a hell lot more important than it looks and feels too.

Some people I guess are just as happy that way, but it's a knock against the game for me. I mean: what's more of a fun goal: building buildings, or moving up a track??

I wonder to what degree all this is player dependent though. I mostly play 2 player of this game, and that makes the God tracks more powerful.

Still, cool game. I love being on the edge of disaster and just scraping out success (or at least survival) :)

Most interesting worker placement game I've ever played. Very deep strategy, many different valid strategies, and requires planning ahead in interesting ways. The moving gears element of the board makes the game instantly interesting to new players, and it's well integrated into the game (not just a gimmick). Good production values too - the crystal skull tokens are amazing.

Best with 4, but works with 2-4. Highly recommended for people who like worker placement games and want to try one with a different twist on the concept.

RATING: 9
Beautiful and original game. I don't agree with the criticisms I have read here on BGG, i.e. the game being yet-another worker placement game, with a new mechanic. The gears and the whole timing strategy ARE original and not only on the mechanical level, the entire game is different because of them.

Even without considering its "originality" factor, the game manages to integrate already seen mechanics in a beautiful whole.

The map and the components, and the way the gears are used, increase the WOW factor: this game is somehow an event in the hobby.

It is highly replayable. There are many paths to victory, and I like that one can try out different strategies every time one plays, and see how they work, as funny experiments.

It scales well (in 3 and 4 players at least, I have not tried the game in two, but I guess that it is also good in two).

The only reason it does not get a "10" from me is that I miss a bit the strategic depth and tension that I appreciate in my preferred games (e.g. Ora et Labora). Sometimes it seems that the small tactical moves and calculations have a bigger impact than I would like for the "perfect" strategy game.

In any case this game should be present in any collection, also because it is somehow a middle-weight game (possibly as middle weight game my preferred one) and so approachable to less "hard" gamers, with a short playing time (another plus, it seems that so much happens in approx. 90 minutes). So very easy to find occasions to play it.

Recommended.

For me, this game is kind of like my golf game.  I'm not very good, but every once in awhile you hit that one shot that makes you want to play it again.

I might not win very often, but I love pulling off a coordinated 4 or 5-pawn combination.  When that happens, I don't care if I win.

I don't get the hype. The gears are neat but seems to be on the only thing that stands out in the game. It maybe a bit harsh to call them a gimmick but they aren't too far off. The game is dry and oh so boring. The first player seems to have a big advantage. The first time I played it I didn't take enough corn and I was boned for the rest of the game. At the end one of the players was like "Oh yeah, that is the wrong opening move" but didn't have any other move because I was last player. I don't mind euros but this is the worst type of euro. The only reason I didn't rate this 1 is because I don't think it is totally broken. But I'll leave a game session before I play it again.

Gimmick or not?

I say no.  It may have started out as a gimmick, it may have been the reason I bought it, but the game play behind the gimmick is solid enough that you will not hear me complaining.  

Place your workers on cogs so that turns later you can remove them to get bonuses and rewards.  Usually the longer you keep a worker on a cog the bigger and better the advantage will be when removing said worker.

Manage your buildings, temples, god favors, crystal skulls, and a few other items to win this gem of a game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Super difficult for the brain to process on the first play; reminds me of my first game of Agricola: so much to do, time flies, and suddenly you can't do a single thing at endgame. Like Caylus, it's important to amass gold to build the prestige buildings. Like Agricola, it's important to have your meeple feeding squared away and to acquire more meeple. Like Macao/Trajan/Ora & Labora, you have to plan your moves in advance so as to minimize doing just one thing on a turn. Like Le Havre, you plan your moves and then too late realize that you're short a resource on the turn when you were going to do that thing. With a combo of elements from such highly-rated games, no wonder this game has shot up the rankings without warning to land at #17 as I write this. A real brain burner, this one, but it might get much, much easier on subsequent plays, like Agricola did. For now I'm marking it as Heavy, even though it plays quickly for a Heavy game--the litmus test being that afterward, everyone just wanted to go home, and it was only 10:30.
------
Second play was indeed much easier, but I still couldn't build the monument I wanted due to again mis-assessing the point in the game in which it was necessary to get my ducks lined up. It seemed like there was more time than there really was (thus is the calendar theme freighted with even greater meaning).

Without sarcasm or any desire to rain on someone else's parade, I truly don't understand the amazing mount of hype surrounding this game.  It's yet another worker-placement game.  It's a solid worker-placement game with an interesting "place or claim" mechanic, but the game and its gears -- oh, pardon the pun -- grind on and on with little differentiation from one round to the next.  It continues until it's done... and then it's done.

But more than anything else, while I was playing, it made me think of Caylus.  And it made me want to be playing Caylus instead.  When playing a game makes you want to play a different game, something's wrong.

The highlight of the game is the gears. Not only an inspired way of speeding up the upkeep between rounds, they also allow the progression of time to become an easily trackable and usable factor with the actions of workers getting better as they age. I also like that having more workers isn't an obviously good thing - becoming prohibitively expensive to use the full complement. The rest of the game is solid, though familiar, worker placement fare, with feeding workers, progressing along tracks and building engines to do actions more efficiently.

I feel slightly disappointed that every time the gears are turned a random worker doesn't disappear to his doom through a hole in the board.

Not sure what it is, but I just can't get really into it.
 I don't usually mind worker placement, a good amount of brain burning, planing in advance, different strategies to get points and taking into account timing (which the game all does and I can't say it does it badly), but in this game the combination of these things just doesn't click for me. In some way there is maybe too many options for my taste and just no luck element or maybe a special ability element that "guides" you too favour one or the other strategy, so I guess I'm maybe missing a little bit of a tactical element.

NB: there are some problems for colourblind folks - yellow and green player pieces are very tough to split. This is simple to fix, especially as it seems de rigeur to paint and decorate the components.

Tzolk'in est pour moi une grosse surprise ludique.
Je m’intéresse de plus en plus à ce style de jeu, surtout la partie placement d'ouvrier qui est au cœur de ce jeu.
Ce jeu pourrait être qualifié comme étant familial ++ mais je préfère le qualifier de kubenbois accessible.
Déjà la thématique claque pour un jeu kubenbois : l'univers Maya est bien retranscrit et cohérent même si ce n'est pas le plus important dans ce jeu, ça fait quand même plaisir car c'est un minimum immergeant.
Le gros point positif de ce jeu ce sont les roues du calendrier Maya. Cette mécanique de roue ingénieusement associée au placement d'ouvrier font que l'on va pouvoir calculer pas mal de coup fumants plusieurs tours à l'avance et quelle satisfaction cela apporte de les voir se réaliser :-).
La richesse du jeu est également un bon point positif : il y a énormément d'actions possibles, de combinaisons, de stratégie à mettre en place. Les batiments et monuments à construire apportent également leur lot de diversification pour améliorer le potentiel de rejouabilité.
Côté matériel, c'est également un point positif car le plateau, les roues, les tuiles et les kubenbois sont de qualités. Par contre comme bien souvent hélas : pas de rangement adapté dans la boite :-( tous les kubenbois et tuiles sont dans des sachets plastiques tout mélangés. Si on prévoit pas mal de partie, une boite de rangement me parait indispensable.
Pour moi le seul point négatif réside dans les règles, surtout la quantité de règles et comment se les approprier. Le livret est très clair et le web ne manque pas de vidéos explicatives. Cependant, il est très difficile voir impossible de commencer la partie sans avoir fait le tour complet de toutes les actions du jeu sur le plateau. Même si on se permet une première partie un peu free style, cette phase d'apprentissage des règles est un peu douloureuse ... Une fois mise en pratique tout devient clair et intuitif cependant. C'est un peu comme la découverte d'un bon fromage de chèvre : au début ça pique, si on fait pas attention on vomit partout, puis avec de la pratique on a toujours envie d'explorer tellement c'est bon et ça un gout de reviens-y.
Pour moi un très bon jeu stratégique/calculatoire qui procure des sensations bien sympa quand on voit se réaliser nos plans sur plusieurs tours.

Amazing game. Quite hard too, but always fun. It was my favorite game in my shelf, and now stays second, only bested by Star Wars Rebellion (own lots of games, though, so second is great). I love how there are lots of different ways to achieve victory, but you can't do them all, or even get close to that. You can also mess up with the other players strategies once you know what they are up to.

[i]- Beautiful production, even with unpainted gears. 
- The artwork on the board/tiles really evokes the theme in a very simple/clean way.
- A unique entry into the worker placement genre that feels fresh and different.
- Planning and using the gear mechanism well is a delicious puzzle to solve.
- This is a game you continue to think about after you play, there is a ton of decision space to explore.

Interesting mechanic.  Feels unique and fun.  I really enjoy the decisions of when to put workers on the gears versus taking them off, and how long to leave them on.  There are alot of things to consider and this is a game that rewards long term planning. I have concerns about broken strategies but don't play in tournaments or with anyone who knows the game well enough for that to be a problem.

It took a while for this game to really click for me, but it eventually did. The theme still feels a bit pasted on, but I can look beyond that. It plays sooo much faster when everyone knows what they are doing, which makes a huge difference.

Not just another worker placement game.
You can place, or take off.  When you place, you can place different numbers of workers, in different locations and the longer you leave them there the better.

I dont have another game like this, but if someone knows of one, please let me know as I really like it.

Played over a hundred games whilst playtesting it and dont think I will ever tire of playing it as it is such a clever game.

Oy. Love the central mechanic and look/theme of this game. But the decisions and accounting can lead to a large amount of AP here! It's your basic Euro worker placement with interlocking resource wheels acting as the gimmick for the turns. Timing is a critical element of strategy to doing well in this game and one I haven't mastered yet (along with many other mechanics). But I'd play again.

[-]Needs more plays before rating, but after first game,[/-] I feel like it's solid 8. After learning more how to play etc, rating might come down depending how much variety there is, but at least now I really doubt it.

RATING: 7
Convert actions into resources into victory points in lots of different ways. The gimmick is the gear mechanism, which stops players going directly for the actions they want - they must place on the worst action of a type and each turn that they wait, they'll get a better action. So the constant decision process through the game is whether to take off now and do something else, or wait longer and get better - how long can you wait. The big strategy decision is how do you plan to collect your VPs, which then allows you to focus on which actions will get you there and not get distracted by the hundreds of other things you can do. So, yep, very Euro with no link to theme at all, but well done and seemingly tightly designed, with a great gimmick to bring it all home. Worth playing, probably worth exploring. But the game has such an incremental feel that it does seem to devolve to HR management with your dudes - on, off, on, off - and I'm not sure that replays will get me past that feeling, even when trying different strategies.

What I like:
- Delayed gratification mechanic is cool
- You can win without taking additional workers
- 4p learning game finished in under 2 hours
- The asymmetrical starting goods/bonuses
- Appears to have multiple viable strategies

What I don't like:
- Too many options and combinations
- Timing is super-critical to the point of frustration

The theme doesn't mean a lot, but it doesn't feel abstract. It does feel a bit like a VP salad, although it rewards some specialization, and mostly encourages you to find your own path with less competition.

I would put the weight around 3.5, which is well above my preference. I would play this again, because it is quick and (at least in my first game) not very confrontational. But I would never ask for it.

This game has a nice variant of worker placemet which I like. I don't like what it shares with games like Agricola: get food, get food, get food. The only good thing in this game with the shortage of food is that getting and having more workers doesn't necessary be an advantage, since you need to feed them to work. 

Some buildings are somewhat unbalanced; whoever gets a "half food off" building at the beginnig has an much easier way all trhrough the game (even worse if you get both).

10+ Plays - A fantastic worker placement type game. Works so well in every way. Many games rely on players inevitably doing a simple math calculations. This seems to avoid that trap with its amazing moving dials etc. (though secretly you're still doing math, just in disguise). Many, many strategies to try out, with the competitive aspect of worker placement and different monuments each game forcing players to stay versatile and adaptive.

Based on one play: A very cool mechanic. You place your workers on dials and then each turn the main dial (calendar) turns, causing all your workers to move (or work). The longer you leave them, the better reward you get, since actions from your workers are taken when you remove them, not when you play them. All this to collect items to get end of game scoring or make offerings to the gods. A nice twist to worker placement.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
My one play was somewhat enjoyable, but I doubt I play it again and I certainly would never buy it.  I could easily see this game as killing the euro genre for some.  It is blatantly a "collect stuff and turn it in for points" game on "rails" (or "gears").  The gears...work..., but I cannot help but think the gears are an intended satire illuminating the worst part of eurogames.  I still enjoy many eurogames and probably always will, but Tzolk'in has at least showed me things I will try to actively avoid in games.  

Oh, and the fact that this game is ranked #17 shows me how utterly pointless rankings can be.  Totally undeserved.

This game has a fantastic theme perfectly integrated with innovative mechanics.  Basically, you place your workers on a number of gears that all move in step with a central gear; the longer the worker stays on the gear, the better the action you'll get when you remove him (generally).  The catch is that, on your turn, you can either place or remove workers--never both and never neither.  Planning becomes essential in this game, as you don't want to get stuck needing resources from removing a worker the same turn you want to place, or run out of workers to place when you need your workers to keep going around.  If you plan it out right, you can truly have some amazing turns though (and conversely, it feels positively suboptimal to only do one thing on your turn sometimes).  This is an excellent planning game that rewards long-term thinking; definitely one of my favorites of the year.

RATING: 5
Personally I found it to be fairly overhyped. The gear mechanism is cool, but it felt just like a typical worker placement. Lots of ways to score points, but being forced to get food several times during the game AND use food to do more than 1 action a turn felt fairly constraining. Agricola at least you have several options to get food in a substantial way and aren't required to use food to take most actions.

Edit: This is the best made game that just isn't for me. Absolutely well made, but I just don't jive with the timing aspect of the game. I should like everything about this game...but I just don't. This is one of a very select few that has me baffled as to why I don't love it.

RATING: 8.5
Excellent worker placement game. Introduces the element of "time", where if you wait before picking up your workers, you end up getting more. It offers strategy and tactical choices, as well as jockeying with the turn order; sometimes you'd want to be first, sometimes last. Plays great with 4 players and very good with 3 players. It's also playable with 2 players, but should not be played without expansions, since players will sooner or later find the dominant strategy of the game, which will kill its replayability.

I'm not generally into the heavier games but Tzolk'in grabbed me from the start. Something about the planning aspect and the ability to really pull off some big moves. For me it plays best with 3., but it's also decent 2-player, although some aspects of the game (like the temple track) do become overly-important. Rating would be higher if there was slightly more player interaction.

Some of the icons and directions should be more clearer.  Game can be prone to AP.

It's a super attractive, high quality, tactile game experience. I just don't see myself pulling it off the shelf much. This game sort of exemplifies what I don't like about Euro games sometimes.

RATING: 8
Intricate game, with fairly simple and clear rules, but a ton of things going on. The amazing thing about Tzolk'in is that it's balanced in such a way that you can play it tactically or strategically, and it all works. I really does use time as a resource, or concept, which is fairly novel, and not at all gimmicky as it may appear.

At its heart, Tzolk'in is a game that requires planning. Every turn you either put one or more workers on the wheels, which will rotate to better positions if you let them stay there for a while, or move one or more of them off, and get rewards for it. You can't place and pull workers in one turn, so you need to plan ahead.

The genius is that it's up to you how far you want to plan ahead. You could play it purely tactically, opportunistically and reactively, put your workers in the best spots available, and pull them off as soon as they reach a desired spot. Or you could get in a three turn rhythm where you place two workers, then place two more workers, then pull all four and repeat. Or you could plan even more turns ahead, where you place a worker on the lowest spot, and decide that you won't touch it again until it has reached the highest spot five or more turns later. And then you could plan your strategy right from the beginning of the game, and decide where your roughly want to be placing for all twenty-something turns.

The balance = lots of options works for many aspects of the game. You could get to six workers, or stay at three, and because you won't be able to place them every turn anyway, these extra actions aren't game-breaking. Six or three can both be a valid strategy. Similarly, you could go for a lots of food strategy, which takes time to setup but gives you a lot of flexibility later, or just scrape by so you can focus on points from the get-go. Resources can be used for techs to help your overall strategy, for buildings for immediate benefits, or saved for monuments which score you a lot of points at the game end. Again, it's up to you how much you want to invest in future turns. Strategy or tactics, whatver you like best.

A nifty rule that sets it apart from ordinary worker placement games is that you have to place on the lowest available spot on a wheel. This means that when someone blocks you, as will often be the case in worker placement, this also opens up a new spot, the one that has now become the lowest available place. This means that on a micro-level, blocking isn't really an issue (and in fact, in this game one player places all workers before the next player does), but on a bigger level it certainly matters a lot whether a wheel is barely or heavily used by the players, so all the interaction is there.

Another thing that's great about the game, is though there is a lot going on on the board, everything is depicted in clear icons, so you shouldn't have any problem getting into the game again if you haven't played it for a year or so. 

Tzolk'in is certainly a modern game, in the sense that it has a billion stuff and tons of routes to victory. Lots of things score you points, and you can collect things that turn into other things, &c. More involved than elegant. More Feld than Knizia, in that way.

And that is a trend in boardgame design that I really dislike. But in Tzolk'in there's action, reaction, interaction. You make your own choices, but don't play your own little game. You manage, you plan, you respond to the demands of the game and to opportunities that open up. If you don't mind (or actively like) the planning that's needed, this is a ton of fun.

A kivitelezés egyszerre gyönyörű és praktikus. A forgó fogaskerekekhez hasonlót még nem láttam ezelőtt. Ami külön figyelemreméltó,  hogy a kivitelezés is strapabírónak tűnik, remélhetőleg nem fog elkopni pár használat után! A konfrontáció nem jellemző a játékra és a szerencsefaktor is szinte nulla. Több stratégia van a győzelemhez, pl. én tegnap "Monument" nélkül simán nyertem, holott az olyanok vélekedése szerint, akik már játszottak vele korábban ezek beszerzése elengedhetetlen a győzelemhez.

I like the use of the gears and I don't really think it's gimmicky since it manages one of the fundamental and unique mechanics of the game, which is time. Timing actions in order to do what you want makes for deep and possibly satisfying game. I say possibly, because one screw-up can be costly. 

EDIT: I find myself not enjoying this game as much as I want to. It's just always a struggle it seems, and that's not much fun.

[floatleft][ImageID=1475619][/floatleft][floatright][ImageID=1437866][/floatright]Tzolk'in was one of the Essen 2012 releases that interested me the most. I was lucky enough to play it at Lobster Trap 2012. I was lukewarm about Tzolk'in after my first play session but my enjoyment for this game has risen after a second play. I can see myself liking this game even more with additional plays. I liked how the gears managed player token progression. The player who won one of the games I played was able to formulate a plan five turns in advanced to score significant points to culminate in a victory. I doubt I will add Tzolk'in to my collection but I will gladly play it again.

It's resource management game where time becomes a crucial resource. Your turns are simple, as it's either place one or more guys, or pull one or more guys. Very easy for new players, but has a lot of depth in terms of trying to be the most efficient in your path. Each turn, the dials click, making the space your worker sits on more valuable, so the longer you wait, the better your action is. It's visually and mechanically fascinating, as you try to figure out the most efficient paths to collect the resources you need to win, while other players grab up your spots.

I should mention there is an expansion for this game that adds a 5th player, but I haven't enjoyed it so far, so I'm not going to go into it here further.

Not a bad game at all, but has some really frustrating issues. First, the board itself was horribly warped, which made the main draw of the game (spinning the calendar wheel) seem like more of a chore than it needed to be.  Second, it was hard to shake the idea that every move needed to be long-term planned before taking an action.  There's just too much to do!  I'm sure this approach was meant to mirror the "point salad" Stefan Feld genre, but it feels more like busy work.  Further, because you must plan many moves ahead, AP becomes an enormous problem for all but the most decisive of players.  The tech tree is fairly superficial and feels tacked on as well.  
I guess my biggest complaint, however, is that despite the clever gears/planning mechanism and all of the bells and whistles, Tzolkin still feels like a fairly vanilla WP game.  I'd rather play Keyflower.

Ich versuche Spiele wie dieses kritisch zu betrachten. Mag ich es nur wegen der besonderen Mechanismen? Machen diese Mechanismen das Spiel besser? Ich behaupte einfach mal, dass die Zahnräder nicht wirklich notwendig sind, da man genauso gut auch Schritt für Schritt nach vorne gehen könnte. Die Mechanik funktioniert aber sehr gut, ist effektiv und macht das Spiel tatsächlich interessant. Die Regeln sind unheimlich schwer zu verinnerlichen, die Zahnräder gestatten allerdings immense Planung und taktische Tiefe und auch wenn das alles eher kritisch klingt: hat man sich erst einmal in die Abläufe hineingefuchst, ist das Spiel eine absolute Bereicherung für meine Sammlung.

RATING: 5
An overly complicated worker placement game with some interesting ideas, but ultimately requires too much simple mental processing and too few interesting decisions.
The movement of the gears is just complicated enough that you can't easily see what the outcomes of your options will be, but simple enough that you can calculate the outcomes in your head for a turn or two in advance. This encourages, or really requires, you to constantly do boring calculations in your head to figure out how many turns from now you can take a set of actions together, or when you should place all your workers. I also just generally dislike games where you are best served by choosing one full-game strategy at the beginning and implementing it as efficiently as possible.
For all that complication, it doesn't feel like there are correspondingly more interesting choices to be made.  The available strategies are not really more nuanced than in simpler worker placement games, but the amount of calculation to make the strategy work is much longer and gets tedious. I would rather play a more straightforward worker placement game like Stone Age or Lords of Waterdeep.

Tzolk'in is one of those games that has a definite "aha" in its visual appeal. However, it is definitely not a gateway game because it has one of the steepest learning curves and it is very easy to miss a rule or to be overwhelmed by all the different moving parts. 

That said, the theme and mechanics combine well together and creating an "engine" that gives you a good mix of victory points and resources is the rewarding challenge. The replayability factor is high because the best engine for a given game will depend on the monuments in play (these vary every game and only a subset of all the monuments are used in a single game; monuments per game are a limited supply and not refreshed when a player builds one) and the buildings that come into circulation during the game (buildings, unlike monuments, are refreshed when a player builds one but even so not all buildings will see the light of day during a single game).

A very unique worker placement game that involves adequate timing and planning due to the gear movements. The mechanic that requires you to either remove or place at least one worker every turn makes the game incredibly challenging. Corn is also tight, which makes the game difficult. You need corn to feed as well as corn to place workers. You also need corn to pay up for a higher spot on the gears. The technologies, god track, and buildings all give you nice bonuses.

Ran long, burnt out about three quarters through. Point salad worker placing blech. The moving parts of the mechanics (both the literally moving parts, and the game design parts) are widespread to the point of distraction, and none of the symbology that coats the board is intuitive.

Been playing 2 player on BGA. Still not thrilled, but with the computer automating it, it's far more bearable, and not having to worry about how the temple track works helps a lot.

My biggest issue with this game is that corn is sorta central to everything in a way that feels almost forced. You don't gather corn because you feel it's super useful. CORN IS DEAD, LONG LIVE THE CORN.

RATING: 7.5
Good theme and beautiful board design.
Can have a steep learning curve with one or two wrong moves messing up the entire game. Replayability is limited, though it improves with the expansion tribes and prophecies. Sadly, some tribes are clearly stronger than others.

Reduced the rating a bit because base game is slightly broken in my opinion, a clear advantage to people who advance on resource extraction track.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Nice gimmick with the gears to introduce a timing element to the worker placement. Your primary resource is used to support the workers and to manage your placements. However, having both can also introduce massive AP. There is so much else thrown in different resources/ tech tracks/ building tracks / multiple scoring tracks, the game breaks down under its own weight.

It feels the same as so many other heavy Euros.  Claim workers / get resources / manipulate resources into other resources / point salad resource/VP abilities, or resource/VP bonuses, or VPs... So much planning...
I suppose I lost my taste for these many resource / many ways of scoring games. Personally I find it plays much longer than it is worth. I was rather annoyed than enjoyed playing it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
After several games still haven't figured out a winning strategy. Too much depends on the other players' choices in a 4p game or on the dummies in a 2 p game. It comes down to scoring in the temples, but you will have to pick a skull or two. A very, very balanced game where each advantage seems to be a disadvantage at the same time. Good job on this addictive game. Especially the two-day-turn messes up strategies for good!

I've now gotten to play this in physical form as well as on board game arena. I think it is a fun game, but there's nothing outstanding about it to me. The wheel mechanic is very cool visually, but after the novelty wears off the gameplay that Tzok'in presents is merely alright. It's a fairly bland worker placement that doesn't offer as many interesting choices as I had hoped. I like it enough to play here and there, but given I can play online, I probably won't ever wind up getting this one. It's good and I'll usually play if offered the chance, but in my opinion it isn't outstanding.

Actually better than I thought. Gears are a nice addition, but the game itself isn't that much different from classic euro. Worker placement, lots of "if you put it here, you get to do that", so that you have no idea really what to pick up. Looks like a game, in which you pick up a winning strategy at the beginning and if you're blocked/interrupted, you're picking the next-in-line strategy. It's playing quite quick, though. Just few placements or grabs, upkeep, cogs, and again and again. 

The "you can use any action from any wheel" field on one cog feels too powerful. 

Solid game, just doesn't excite me. Will play maybe 2-3 times more.

This is a generous rating considering that I do not like worker placement games.

The gimmick is that you do not immediately get the resources or special abilities the same turn that you place your workers. The longer you delay getting those resources or special abilities from your workers, the better the resources/special abilities become.

I only played one three player game, and the game went very fast. However, all three of us are not prone to AP and we aren't afraid of making stupid mistakes on our first play. With rule explanation, I think it only took us 90 minutes.

Great worker placement game. It's not a straight programming mechanic, but you do need to appropriately assign workers and time their removal.

This has to be one of the best - if not THE best - worker placement games out there. So they say the wheels are juest a gimmick, because you could do without them. Well, you probably could, but why would you? The way it's done, it's perfect - a perfect mechanic in a perfect game.

I love everything about it. Want to use more than one of your workers this turn? Here you go, use all of them if you want - but pay the cost. So simple, yet so engaging! Forces you to think strategically on multiple levels. How many workers do I need to stay on the wheels - and for how long? How much corn can I sacrifice? So many questions, and so many answers too! One of the games every eurogamer should own. Also, lots of replayability in the box (even more with the best expansion ever made, "Tribes and Prophecie"). You could play it a hundred times and still have fun with it. Seriously, just try it.

Another game where it could have just been a flash-in-the-pan gimmick.  I waited a long time to pick this one up, but it was worth finally getting.  The gears here truly reduce the fiddliness for this type of worker placement game and allow advancement over time in a very understandable and easy format.  I love the varied strategies available and really appreciate the puzzle of figuring out those turns where you can line up various workers and remove them all at the same time to get a really good combination.  This game is very fun for me, even though I am not very good at concentrating on things that actually give me points!

Place workers on the turning cogs; the longer you leave them there the more powerful the action when you take them off.

After years of gathering dust on the shelf, recently I relearnt the rules of this one and ca. 4 weeks ago I put it on the table finally. That was partly due to the sudden emergence and rapid gain of popularity of the designer team in my house (Lorenzo Il Magnifico, Voyages of Marco Polo), so I was eager to test this, knowing that it was hugely popular on BGG. 
The distinctive feature of of the game is its worker placement/removal mechanics (I'm not 100% sure, but I think this was the first game where - as an action - you had to remove your workers from the table), and the rotating gears, which makes the yield of each worker more beneficial with every passing round. That is, if you can wait so long, until they get into these positions.... If you have no worker in your reserve, you do have to remove worker(s) from the board! This presents a very brainburny exercise of tempo play and timing: it is mighty satisfying when you managed to pull of your masterplan you started 4 rounds earlier!
Otherwise it is surprising, how the game managed to achieve so much with so little: there are not a lot of components in the box, but the underlaying web of mechanics yield a very complex game in spite of this. Due to this I regard this game as an example of a very elegant design. 
There is a lot going on in this game: aside of the main mechanics (worker placement / removal) there is the temple track, there are the monuments (varyiing end game scoring potential) and the different level 1/2 buildings, plus the requirement to feed your workers every so often. This is not that depressing as in Agricola for example but neither is it easy, so you definetely have ot put emphasise on this, otherwise you will face consequences during the feed days later on.
There seems to be a lot of valid strategy in this game and I'm eager to find them. :)

Great game - but. For some reason my brain couldn't grasp the game. Even at the very end of the game I had no idea what I was doing - I understood all the mechanics but scoring points just wasn't apparent to me at all. Had a great time playing it though and would be up for another game!

EDIT: After several plays online, I've lowered the score. I've won with every strategy and the game challenges no longer feel difficult to overcome. I still love it - but doubt I'll play it much more without the expansion.

Tzolk'in feels like a lot of other games, feeding the workers, building monuments, etc. What's really unique here is the way the gears change the pace of the game. Managing your resources is important, but managing your time is even more. It's fun to watch your workers make their way around the wheels, waiting for that one big action.

In the end, Tzolk'in takes my old favorite mechanics and breathes new life into them. It's a finely tuned game that I don't see myself ever growing tired of.

The gears are great.  On your turn you can either place a worker(s) on the gears, or remove a worker(s) from the gears.  The longer you let them stay on the gears the more powerful the actions you get when you pull them off the gears.

Great Mayan theme.  Great artwork.  I'm too lazy to paint the gears, but you can make this game as visually stunning as you'd like if you're artistic.  Personally, I just printed an Aztec calendar on a color printer and taped it to my central gear....looks great.

A little complicated to learn, but very fun.
Description: Worker placement with delayed yield due to rotating gears, resource management, set collection, economic engine, farming Euro game placed in the ancient Mayan empire.

Players: 2 to 4. Best with 4.  Weight: Medium.

A standard economic game involving gathering and advancing resources, advancing on technology tracks and VP tracks, and creating buildings to improve your abilities and score points. Great production. 

Impression: Rotating gears representing Mayan calendar and a placeholders for workers are not just gimmick. It is one of the most brilliant game designs I've ever seen. There are multiple viable strategies and paths to victory and variable setup with starting tiles and randomized structures.

Likes: Gears. They are cool. Theme is also nicely implemented into mechanics and everything is well tied with said gears.

Dislikes: Existence of a dominant strategy that can be abused by the first player. I haven't seen it yet, but I have a knowledge of it and it is annoying. I presume it can be mitigated with Tribes and Prophesies expansion which I have yet to try.

I liked the interesting worker placement + gear combo.  This one is a thinker...

This one is going to take a few plays to let it reveal it's mysteries to me.  :)

The foresight needed to time the gears is so cool.  It's so satisfying to see it all come together.

Tzolkin is an excellently designed worker placement Euro. I really like the main mechanism of putting/taking workers on/off the board. This really elevates this from blander Euros, since basically you still gather resources, build buildings and advance on some abstract tracks.

The game really rewards additional plays as you become much better over time (it is about realizing on what to go for and what not to do). Especially when you discover how to go for the resource/building strategy and completely neglect farming, you can totally destroy any newbie players (well, destroy in the sense of gaining a lot more points). [i]Update: Well, you can destroy them  with farming+skulls, too; being experience just really matters  in this game.[/i] 

The components of the game are excellent. The gears work perfectly and make a really engaging game board. A real good bonus are the plastic skulls, which could just have been blue cubes. Upgrading the other resources with Stegmaier's Treasure Chest really  turns this game in a deluxe version.

Finally got to play this! I'm not sure if it's a game I'd like normally - it seems to be a game of incremental advantages and much more strategic than tactical. But the visual appeal of the game and the gears, which I don't feel are a gimmick, push this over the edge for me. Can't think of a more clever way to implement the mechanic of workers becoming more powerful the longer you leave them out there.

Needed a few plays to understand the game. Many ways to victory. Player interaction is subtle, by either giving the the wheels an additional spin or by stealing an action.

RATING: 9
The wheels are like Macao, but interesting in that they fit together as gears, some rotating clockwise and others counterclockwise, requiring more thought in one's strategy across the 26 game turns -- much like in Trajan. Otherwise, this is a standard economic game involving gathering and advancing resources, advancing on technology tracks and VP tracks, and creating buildings to improve your abilities and score points. Great production.

First off, the Mayan Calender wheel is an incredibly innovative design.  It automatically and effortlessly takes care of a ton of fiddly bookwork that would be needed it it were just chits or cubes moving around.  So if one is thinking it just a gimmick that is not true this game would be so clunky without it.  

That being said, this was a nice worker placement euro that really takes some planning and timing.  it really takes a game to start to click on this one.  Interesting decisions with respect to the technologies, Chichen Itzen wheel, God tracks and feeding your tribe.  

Bottom line, a fun game that really needs multiple plays to become efficient.  Lots of potential for this rating to rise as there is a lot more exploring possible in this game.

Update:this plays quick as a two player but still encompasses the same feel.  There is just so much to explore in this game so many paths.  Really enjoying it. However, i do wish I felt like I was building something more.  It's more of a "point salad" type game as the theme is a little thin (other than the innovative use of the Mayan calender).

I was sold on the cogs. These five interconnected plastic cogs sit in the centre of the board. Every turn you advance the central cog one space and everything else moves as well. You put your workers on the cogs and then you pull them off when they reach the space that contains the resource you want (there essentially five different resources, you use corn to get workers on to the board, wood, gold, and stone to build things, and the anachronistic crystal skulls to score victory points).
This is really just a low interaction economic game where your placements and decisions subtly alter the market for the other players. But the cogs give it a real elegance and it seems to play quite quickly (we had three players) for a relatively deep game. I'm definitely keen to give this one another go.

The gears in this game add some complexity to a worker placement game.  I enjoyed the second game a lot more once we got to grips with the rules.

Of all the new games of 2012, this was the one I most eagerly looked forward to playing. We got it early, in November oorc, and played it a few times when it was new, and I've played it about 6-8 times since. Over the course of these games, the initial promise of the game has faded away. In my gaming groups we just find it so hard to find a coherent strategy - forget those scores of 90 or 100+ you read about on BGG, I've never seen a score higher than the mid-60s, and scores of that range have almost always been achieved by the most straightforward route of going for crystal skulls. Every time I personally have tried a different strategy, I've crashed and burned, getting 40-odd, even less sometimes. I've even read strategy articles here, so know of the 3 supposed main strategies for high scores - but it's the tactics, and how to set these strategies up, which let me down. And no-one else in my gaming groups has managed better - even my wife, who is normally quick to pick up good strategies in games like this, and will crush the rest of us for at least a while. But not here, she certainly wins her fair share but gets scores no higher than the ones I mentioned earlier.

I know I shouldn't really penalise a game by rating it low (not that 7 is a low rating, but it's lower than I expected to be rating this game) just because I and the rest of my gaming groups are terrible at the game, but it can't help but affect the amount of fun I have playing. I'll still rarely refuse to play this, but it's almost never going to be a game I suggest any more. There are literally dozens of other Euros that I'd much rather play on almost all occasions.

To finish on a positive note, though - it's a very interesting and fun mechanism, and the game is very well presented as all CGE games are. As I already said, I'd almost never refuse to play it, so it maintains a 7 rating - its only real flaw is not being the amazing game that I had at first hoped for (and even expected).

This worker placement game blew me away. The gear mechanic is incredible. Your planning skills are really put to the test when only being able to place or activate users each turn (but not both). Possibly having your workers pass up the spots that you are wanting to use and making use waste corn to use the previous locations. I also love the ability to gain technology to increase power of certain actions. You'll want to do it all. Lastly, the crystal skulls are fantastic!

(+) A new twist to worker placement games!
(+) Nice, original theme
(+) Very flexible: a lot of game for a limited set of rules: accessible to casual gamers, yet in the mean while satisfying for "hardcore gamers"
(+) 4 player-playtime: about 2 hours, which is perfect.

(-) In my experience, the game feels a bit too short to reward hard fought long-term investments. I'm still not absolutely sure, but this might compromise replay-value.

RATING: 7
A worker placement game in which the rewards for placing a worker correspond to the length of time you allow it to remain on the board and/or the number of workers already placed in the initial spaces of the same area.

Temporarily not having that worker to place elsewhere offsets the rewards of allowing it to remain in an area longer, since, in that time, the worker could have been placed in two or three different areas to reap a similar benefit, and the higher initial cost of placement offsets the rewards of starting in an area in which the first, less rewarding spaces have already been chosen.

My gut impression is that the players don't so much compete as they do inadvertently affect one another's progress. I only find it necessary to consider other players' resources and the actions they could take when I determine what structures I should work toward building. Otherwise, because every other resource aside from structures is unlimited, other player's actions don't prevent me from accomplishing what I intend to do.

Of course, it may be that I'm just not calculating enough.

The interlocking gear mechanic is extremely innovative and makes the game fun and interesting. The game plays in about 90 minutes, but the main gear which controls the end-game makes you feel like time is quickly running out. As the main gear comes closer to ending the game, you have a lot of different actions that you want to take, but don't have enough time to make them all. Very unique game and the interlocking gears make it outstanding.

I found this to be a game more of tempo management than anything else.  Workers are placed but need to "ferment" a bit as they move up over a few turns to the desired actions.  As players can't pass, there is a lot of tempo management going on to ensure that the various bits align when it is time to consumate all the desired actions.

First of all, do I have enough corn? Yes? O.K. Good. Second, what about the corn? Still ok? Sure?

This game is a great example or worker placement, multiple paths to pursue... all of them using corn.

I particularly enjoy the idea that I *have* to either pick up or place each turn. It adds a certain amount of fore-planning to the mix. Even the idea of paying to skip ahead is well balanced... provided you have the corn.

Now, I'm off to play another game. God will someone burn down that forest, I need CORN!

17-09-2015. Rated after 1 game. Tzolkin took me 3 years to play, and I understand why. It's a heavy euro, I don't usually play those.

The twist here is that there are 5 wheels, and during your turn you either put down markers or remove them from the wheels.  The longer they are on the wheel, the better the action. The earlier you place, and the longer you wait, the cheaper the action will be.
You score VPs in multiple ways. By bying tiles, offering to the gods etc. 
You also need to feed your people.

In any case, the game is ok. It's not my cup of tea but I can recognize a good design. It's a good game, but it looks drab and I cannot plan ahead.

Very deep and complex, this game is one of the most enjoyable games I own. However, it is geared toward seasoned, veteran players and should not be offered to the casual gamer. It is sophisticated with a lot of color and flavor, offering a number of different strategies to try to win with. After several plays now, I feel like the key is to be the highest player on at least two of the three pyramids. Also, if you can place a few skulls at Chichen Itza, you should be able to lock up the victory. Looking forward to my next game!

Very good Euro. I really like the predicting of which future turn you're going to pull off your guy to take the action - felt like Macao but more forgiving.

Really a brain burner of a game.  The key to this game is planning. You place workers on a rotating wheel trying to plan and anticipate when would be most advantageous to remove the workers and take the actions all before other players spoil your plans.  This game itself can be a little long especially if you have people that must plan out every move or take excessive time thinking which is easy to do.  This is really fun if you don't mind some heavy thinking and decision making.  The Mayan theme is really enjoyable and the components are good quality.

This is a clever take on worker placement.
There are a lot of decisions to be made and all of them can be critical to scoring well.

The game has one draw back for me and that is it's learning curve.  It's quite steep in that a newcomer has no way of knowing how the different strategies will play out until they have experienced 1 or 2 games, while veteran players have advantage in just knowing how not to cripple themselves in any 1 given turn.

Still, this one has a lot going for it.  As that veteran player now, I look forward to another game.

Take the most generic euro in existence and put in one gimmick. That's how it felt at first, but it turns out, that gimmick is a good one. The time aspect of getting the action you want puts a whole new spin on things and makes it really puzzley. 

Often, there are many ways to a single goal. The more you examine your options, you keep seeing more and more efficient paths. This is really heightened in the last few turns where you often want to do something to score big points, but need to fit it into the amount of turns left. I love the pressure that provides.

It could be just a little more punishing. The penalties for misjudging your moves are pretty lenient, though.

I can see why this game is popular on BGG. It's the sort of thinky, analysis-paralysis-prone, indirect-interation-only, perfect-information puzzle that appeals highly to a certain (large) crowd.  If you like that, it's a well-done game with a pretty, albeit superficial, theme, and innovative mechanics that make time a crucial resource you need to plan around.  On the other hand, if you don't like having to have an exact plan two or three turns in advance, it can feel a lot like work.  Personally, I'm a fan of having some degree of randomness or hidden information to fuzz the planning horizon, letting you get by with heuristics instead of specific plans, and I prefer more direct interaction over just blocking other players, so it didn't do all that much for me.

Deep and strategic game with a lot of advance planning needed. Very crunchy game that I'd describe as a fun unique worker placement with unique mechanic. Brain burner. It kind of felt like stone age without the dice roll. 

Pros:
- Unique worker placement mechanism
- deep with strategy
- Fast turns and active player engagement outside of turns. 

Cons
- Punishing feeding mechanic
- some AP-ness for people prone to it. 
- Beatiful board, lackluster components.

This game is almost perfect: great looks, very innovative worker placement mechanism, is easy to learn but hard to master, every game you have to concentrate on different things (depending of the monument tiles available and your starting tiles), the game plays pretty quick even with slow thinking players, also plays very well not only with 4 players but also with 3 players (the blocking spots system is excellent).

RATING: 8
A bit dry, but forces you to do that wonderful strategic planning, where you have to know, almost exactly, what you'll be doing for the next couple of turns. Various strategies for obtaining points which you can't pursue all in a single game. It's a pity that one of them - advancing on the temples - is statistically the strongest, while at the same time being one of the easiest, fool-proof and luck independent, comparing for example to a more satisfying builder strategy. With fewer than four people you cannot afford to not fight for them.

Happily, this can by almost completely mitigated by not giving points for position on the temples at the end of first era (only the bonuses). It's a small change, with little impact on the game mechanics, but shifts the balance enough to make other strategies viable.

Solid game that produces some interesting decisions. Good diversity of strategic options. It's a bit dry, though, and for its length it feels like you've accomplished very little by the end. Maybe you moved some markers up some tracks, bought a building or 2, etc. That's what it feels like to me. The theme is irrelevant; this is an abstract with plastic gears.

RATING: 6
Even without the calendar gears the game is a solid one. The gears are what really make it work and turn it into something special. While an elegant solution, they're actually a lot less complicated than I thought they would be and the whole process could have been effected through a simpler moving tableau. The gears are a mechanic I'd like to see developed in other games where players could choose different gear sizes to move on their turn rather than a simple movement of a large central gear per round.

So, what makes the game good? For my taste I enjoy the simplicity of the Carcassonne like mechanic - in this case you'll take any number of workers off the gears, or place as many as you like on the gears up to what you can afford. You're acquiring resources to pay for points you'll be able to earn in a multitude of ways - very Feld like.

This is a simple game with lots of interesting choices and paths, good interaction and manageable uncertainty. Because of the simplicity the game doesn't ever drag (I suppose it always could in the wrong hands), and you'll find yourself engaged and fully engrossed by the time it's over. A good sign. Replay ability comes from the mix of monuments, buildings and starting resources. Good stuff.

Worker placement game in which players collect resources to exchange them for victory points or developments. The design innovation is the gear, that allows to get better payouts depending on the time that a pawn has been placed on the board. So players try to get the best out of their possibilities not only managing resources, but also time, which is the most valuable of them all.

Did Agricola not make you think enough? Then try Tzolk'in! The first play is like three-dimensional chess, trying to stage when your workers come off the wheel and combo with other moves you have in the works... and then the wheel gets double-ticked and everything gets unraveled. Very curious to see how this holds up once you grok the heuristic strategies.

Rules are very clear and it plays beautifully. Introduced the game to various different gamers with different tastes - all loved it.

Esperaba algo diferente de Tzolkin, algo como un Stone Age vitaminado, y me he encontrado con un euro extremadamente exigente con una planificación a largo plazo brutal.

Las partidas que he jugado me han dejado mal sabor de boca, porque lo que leí acerca de la descompensación de los templos es completamente cierta y para mí es un problema de diseño del juego. Quizá haga falta más partidas, pero no tengo muy claro si se las voy a dar.

RATING: 4
The central mechanic is interesting, but it's poorly-executed. It's easy to see the train of thought that developed this game: "The Mayan calendar is hip right now. Ooh, gears! Corn takes time to grow, so the longer you wait, the more you should get. Shoot, I can't think of anything else intrinsically time-and-magnitude based, so maybe if you start carving a crystal skull, but it takes too long, it turns out you were actually mining gold while growing corn all along."

Tzolk'in would benefit from a complete rework. The idea that the passage of time gives you access to a succession of entirely-different, tangentially-related items and actions makes the design and layout seem entirely arbitrary. It'd be much better if the wheels were resource-generation only, and actions and purchases were entirely resource-limited, rather than being "right-place-right-time"-limited (which is just bizarre).

RATING: 6
Worker placement, but with the twist that payoffs increase the longer you leave your worker on the board. Gears are cool. It's nice to see out-of-the-box thinking. Perfect information, and the only source of luck is what building comes up after purchasing one.

A couple nice thematic touches too: I like that you can piss off the gods, and you need to cut trees before you can get (lots of) corn.

Also has my pet peeve with Euro designs: rules are too conservative and namby-pamby to the players. In this case, they create unintuitive exceptions. I can double-time the wheel to screw somebody... only if somebody picked Start Player... only worth it if we're 2 rounds away from feeding instead of both that and when we're 1 round away... can't do it if it'd squish somebody... why can't I squish somebody?!!

Strangely enough, I find this nearly the epitome of the 'pure' worker-placement game (e.g. Agricola isn't pure because of the cards, Stone Age has hidden/trackable information and more luck because of how the cards, not just the buildings, come up), but then the gears, which seem cool at first, disrupt the purity with some weird funky stuff that doesn't really belong to worker placement. So I liked the gears at first, then didn't like them because they just made things murky.

Wow.  So much going on.  The gear mechanic is well done.  I found to be superior to the gear in Ora et Labora.  The game is also different based on the buildings that are available and the order that they come out.  I can also see how Tzolkin scales down well with the dummy players.  The rules are also elegantly implemented so that turns fly by, even with rookie players.

This is an excellent game that I feel is very deserving of its high rating.  One that I look forward to playing again in the future.

This game looks more tricky than ordinary worker-placement games 'cause we must place tokens in space and in time.

The only flaw: the dominant strategy.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
After more than 25 plays of this, my rating for this game is pretty much solidified. The standout mechanism of Tzolk'in is undoubtedly the spinning gears, and I love the idea of options maturing the longer a worker stays on the board. There is so much else to appreciate about the mechanism ― it is a timing puzzle to determine when it is best to place or take back workers, and it enables Machiavellian moments of turning the wheel twice to everyone else's disadvantage. In an unconventional but inspired bit of design, it is sometimes in your favour for opponents to take the cheaper slots so that you can place workers in pricier, stronger slots.

While I initially found the game beyond the gears to be rather standard resource conversion fare, I now have a begrudging fondness for the supporting framework. Yes, it's not very original and primarily about racing up the temple tracks, but I've seen several distinctly successful strategies of racing up the temple (apart from the odd monument-building strategy). The point is that the supporting framework complements the gears nicely, ensuring that friction among players exists despite the presence of a few valid paths to victory.

What prevents me from rating this higher is that the chain of actions is rather overwrought for my liking. I found them overwhelming as a new player, and now find it rather stressful juggling the different elements as a semi-seasoned player. However, credit must be given where it is due ― many things could have easily gone wrong in Tzolk'in, but they didn't, and the end result is a finely-tuned design.

[5 plays] Rating for 4 player is a 9 for me, for 5 player I might give it a 7 because of crowding and downtime although I clearly don’t have the experience to make any definitive judgment. This game is Stone Age plus a time element with the gears and the “place or pull” decision for each turn. I really enjoyed it. There are only a few ways to collect points in the game, but the paths to set yourself up for them are varied. I look forward to seeing people get creative strategies going in subsequent plays.

Won’t pursue owning this, because I would hate to teach it, it is very unforgiving for new players, and Carter owns it among our group.

Tzolk'in brought a new twist to the worker placement genre. Yes, the gears are really pretty and cool, so they may seem like a gimmick, but they work flawlessly in this game! The decisions you have to make throughout are engaging and challenging. This one definitely rewards long-term planning. The components are great, especially the crystal skulls. I quite like the expansion as well as it gives each player their own unique tribal ability. The base game already offers a lot of replayability thanks to the variable starting resources and buildings, but playing with the Tribes and Prophecies adds so much more! This one can feel a bit heavy, but it isn't too much of a brain burner. When I'm up for playing a longer Euro, this is towards the top of my list! It's available to play on BGA, but it's also available on Boite a Jeux with the expansion! Two thumbs up!!

RATING: 7.5
It's always great to see familiar concepts and mechanism evolve and that's just what's happened in this game.  I like to think of Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar as a dynamic worker-placement game since the actions available to a worker gets better the longer the worker remains on the gear.  This seems like such a simple progression in game design, but it adds so much depth and strategy, although the analysis can sometimes take a bit of time. 

My copy arrived with a significantly damaged board and it took a couple attempts and several weeks to get Rio Grande to properly replace it.  Not fun.  Apparently, they have since updated and changed the board a few times to reduce the rate of damage during shipping.

I have played Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar several times and finally have the rules explanation fairly streamlined. I like the game, but wonder if it will start to feel a bit samey after awhile. It is still a fairly basic worker placement game with the available actions improving over time. That's a nice twist, but the game is still just taking actions to get resources to gain advantages or other resources to get eventually get victory points. Some strategies also seem to be more obvious and work way better than others.  This is a concern.  I do look forward to playing more and will hopefully enough in it to keep me interested.  That having been said, I don't think that a full expansion is really necessary (outside the ones that just add a tile or two).

Love the concept, but I have several issues with this game that make me not want to play it again. The flavour is really thin. I'm not a theme nazi, but I've found that the longer and more complex a game is, the more theme helps to keep focus and interest up. My biggest issue though is that it's very hard to plan ahead. Your turns can be very complex and your plan can be drastically changed by the actions of the player before you. Which means player turns are usually fairly long and there's very little you can do on other players' turns. That just kills it for me. I wish someone would produce a smaller less complex game that uses the same core mechanics but which could be played in 45-60 minutes, because I like the idea.

Game play is different from most other worker placement games in that you decide to either send out workers to new positions or to harvest positions. This makes for a rather different game.
The wheel mechanic is nice and all the other mechanics interlock nicely, making for a very good flow. The game feels shorter than it is (always good!).
It is still too complex to hit the table regularly, but I can see enjoying this for a long time to come.

Great game in theory. The turns are played out quickly, there's lots of potential paths to victory, and there's lots of choices on acquiring/spending to be made.  Here's the problem --> I've played this game over 10 times now with experienced gamers but the result is always the same.  Whoever dominates the Skull Wheel ('Chicken-Pizza') wins every time.  The only way to prevent this one winning strategy is to have all players going into the game try to prevent this from the get-go and purposely divide up the points which then makes it less fun... This was an 8.5 when I first played the game a few times, but now that I've seen the lack of balance in strategy it's down to a 6

Az egyik legjobban sikerült idei esseni játékot próbálhattam ki. A dicséretek nem véletlenek a játék tényleg teljesen egyedi és nagyon jól működik. Féltem a szabálytól, de abszolút nem vészes. Gyakorlott játékosok körében egyáltalán kis gondot sem fog okozni, nem nehéz megérteni. A játékot akár rondellásnak is mondhatnám, de itt nem lépünk a rondellákon, hanem forgunk rajta minden körben egyet vagy esetleg kettőt, ha kezdő játékos úgy dönt. Az egyik keréken élelmet és fát, a másikon további nyersanyagokat tudunk szerezni. A harmadik kerék a fejlesztés és építés kereke, a negyedik a csere és gyarapodásé, az ötödik pedig győzelmi pontot hoz. A játék két korszakra oszlik, ezen időn belül kell munkásainkkal nyersanyagokat gyűjteni és épületeket építeni, illetve az ötödik keréken pontot szerezni. Körünkben összesen két dolgot tehetünk csak, vagy felrakunk a kerekekre a munkásainkból vagy leveszünk és akkor végrehajtjuk az éppen ott levő akciót. A játékba beleraktak egy a Caylusból ismert kegyrendszert és három templomot is, amelyen feljebb jutva kapunk különböző bónuszokat, illetve győzelmi pontot, ez szinte egy az egyben a Terra Mytica is hozta az idei évben, meglepő egyezőség. A játék a kerekek miatt szerintem egyedi, persze ezen kívül sok újat nem mutat, de úgy érzem ez elég változatosságot ad a játéknak. Egyetlen veszély a gondolkodás és a holtidő lehet a játékosok lépései között. Szerencsefaktor az egyes épületek feljövetelekor kerül csak a játékba, talán ez még belefér, bár néha lehet bosszantó is. Jó játék a Maya naptár, minden gémernek érdemes kipróbálnia.

Super clever.  Great design.  But I just felt a constant annoyance playing it.  It has all the joy of waiting in a line mixed with all the work of a project manager.  I kept wondering why I wasn't getting paid my regular salary to play this.

This game features three of my least favorite elements in a game: 1. Lots of front end planning that is required to win, but can all be entirely disrupted before any of you plans can come to fruition (and you can't tactically respond).  2. Multiple dead turns in a row if you get out of phase, with very little to do of any interest. 3. Effective elimination where you know you can't actually play the game to come close to winning (or be in anything other than last place) and you just have to sit through the damn thing.  Yuck.

The gears are cool.  But I just didn't have any fun playing it.

This is a fun worker placement game but not my favourite.  While the gears do make it more interesting than it would otherwise be, It seems to be a little too straightforward still.  After a handful of games, I do not feel a strong desire to take it off the shelf or to try to figure out how to exploit the game.

UPDATED 06/05/16:

I have played this often online and i am actually finding the reverse of a lot of what I said above to be true ... but I leave my thoughts there to remind myself how feelings/ratings can change.  It beckons me to pull it down again ... and I always feel so engaged in planning future turns, executing current actions, managing placement and removals, as well as reacting to another player suddenly taking that building you desparately wanted. 

This has become a classic for me because of how many great machanics are all working together so smoothly ... allowing and forcing both Strategic Planning as well as  Tactical reactions

I am convinced that I will like this more once I feel that I have had a truly successful game. Somehow the strategy just never clicks for me, but perhaps that is part of the fascination.

Initially I loved this game.However lots of plays later, I noticed that this game can be suspect to 2 main strategies of min maxing. Also the starting setup in not variable enough..which probably contributes to problem 1. Thankfully the expansion fixes that problem. Consider it a 7 without the expansion, a solid 9 with it.

For some reason I resisted playing this for the longest time. Likely due to the kind of boring box art and what I thought looked like a very gimmicky set of gears on the board. I finally played it and I kind of love it. I'm a fan of worker placement and economic games and this is good at both and the gears make it feel fresh. Can't wait to play this more.

Really, really enjoy this game. After finishing, we wanted to play again right away (the store was closing though so we couldn't).

There are a lot of choices and a lot of things happening at once, so it can feel daunting when first going through the rules, but everything is implemented in such a smooth, simple way, you'll master the rules quite quickly. The real challenge is the strategy. With so many possibilities available to you throughout the game, you will be paying close attention to what your friends are doing and might adjust your own choices multiple times.

Overall it is a very interesting, engaging game with a whole lot of replay value.

It has a really neat gimmick, but my gripe with this game is that the key to winning isn't about strategy as much as it is learning/memorizing optimal placement patterns on the gears.  I think this is really evidenced by people who play the game extensively online and are able to score 150 points, whereas the average/new player probably sees 50 as an achievement.  

The game may have benefited from some sort of randomization in the wheel actions to discourage such mechanical memorization.

A little too mechanical/dry for a game night with friends, and a little too "solved" by players online, sadly.

This is the most original game I've played in a long time, and in a gamespace that is so crowded I wouldn't have thought I would see a new idea any time soon, that gamespace being worker placement.  I love worker placement games so this breath of fresh air caught me hook, line, and sinker!

The game plays by either placing or picking up your workers each turn on spaces on different gears.  Every turn those gears move forward 1-2 spaces and actions are performed when the workers are PICKED UP based on their position along the gears with the more valuable spaces being further along.  Hence, the longer a worker remains in play before being picked up the more valuable the action that worker takes is.

There are the obligatory feeding stages and the game is very tight.  It also requires a lot of forward thinking, even more than the previous "forward thinking" champ, Macao.  Being as you can either pick up or place workers each turn but not both you have to always be thinking when you want to pick up a worker, how many workers to keep in reserves, how much corn you need to place workers (placing workers on more valuable spaces or placing multiple workers a turn always costs this universal resource), feeding your workers, managing 7 different technology and temple tracks, and much more.  There is also building construction that breaks the rules of the game or gives you instant benefits.

There is so much to do and master that I don't see myself getting tired of this game for quite some time even if there isn't a huge amount of variety (there are a decent selection of buildings and powerful monuments but you get a shot at most of the buildings in just one playthrough).

RATING: N/A
Sometimes, as a player, I like to be inspired by games and by the different ways they use, like a disguise, to make the same thing as others. Tzolk'in kind of does that for me. The core of the game, if one takes off its clothes, is the exact same thing like in another zillion of games. But the way the game dresses itself for the moment reminds me of a good old fashioned movie in which the main female character is amazingly illuminated.

Played it only once but for now, and apart from the feeding engine (which doesn't seem to exist at some extent) I think Tzolk'in is a good keeper. Ahhh! But don't expect anything really different. It's a worker placement game with a "programming machine" in which you get resources to convert for Victory Points. But there's nothing wrong with that, right?!

The Gears remind me a little of a super rondel or Mancala. The front end of the game (action selection) looks fantastic and the production is amazing, the back end (what you do withe actions,VPs) looks standard Euro (with a super cool theme)

Hoping this will be one of the best Euros of Essen 2012

It is - very clever action selection mechanic with loads of approaches to win. The most important mat be valuing time - paying corn to get to actions further round the wheels quickly

Second game and I can see the wonderful front end game management tool is going to lose my attention after another couple of plays because the back end - the aims are as generic as the wheel is novel. Vanuatu similarly has a great front end hook and a generic back end - however there is less obvious conflict in Tzolkin and the ability to specalise makes it feel a little solitaire. So it's not my cup of tea - however hats off to an accomplished design, with superb production values and nothing to fault.

Third game and admiration for the gears. They make the bookkeeping part of the game  easy and makes for more time playing and less rule enforcing and setting up turns. This is the real triumph of the game. However, there is not much overt interaction, most seems to be in the getting in the way and trying to find an area where others are not specialising.

Another to like about the game is that getting more workers is not essential to do well

Well, a man can change his mind, can't he?

This game kept popping up in my head long after I played it for the first time. I decided to buy it anyway and played it 4 more times in less than a month.

So yes, this is a very solid worker placement game. Timing issues are much more important here. Especially the choice between placing and retreiving (and which ones?) is usually agonizing.

I don't regret my purchase; this will easily make 10 plays, which I can't say for most games.
***********
Finally, yet another worker placement spreadsheet game!

Hasn't this type of game been done to death already? Although Tzolk'in introduces the interesting choice between either employing your workers or retreiving them, the rest of the game is just the same old-same old: resource collection, different buildings, development tracks and prestige tracks.

I'm completely indifferent towards this game: I would play if asked, but wouldn't request it and most certainly wouldn't buy it.

Had the Mayan calendar been a little more accurate, the world would have conveniently ended and I wouldn't have been forced to play this game!  Again!  I played it once, didn't particularly enjoy it, gave it a second chance about a year later, and hated it.  And I was still confused as to what the hell was going on by the end of the second play.  All I wanted was to get some skulls, but instead I was forced to keep collecting that damn corn!  I can't figure out if this is a very clever design (admittedly, those interlocking wheels ARE a cunning bit of workmanship) or an overwrought and absurd mess of mechanisms.  For most "serious" gamers it seems to be the former; for me the game feel over-designed both mechanically and visually.  I love those skulls, though!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Worker placement somewhat reminiscent of The Manhattan Project -- you either place one or more workers or pull back one or more workers. The trick is that actions are only taken when workers are pulled back, but they are placed on moving gears that correspond to a different (usually better) action each turn. The game timer also includes four "feeding days", with penalities for not paying corn for each worker as well as special scoring opportunities. Managing these overlapping timers in the face of stiff competition is where the fun is, though in practice it's less of a brain-burner than it sounds: the shared gears usually make the board too chaotic for mid-range planning.

There is nothing particularly notable about the rest of the game; it's the usual Feld-ish grab-bag of subsystems.

These days I prefer a more minimalist approach, not exactly a CGE hallmark -- I strongly feel that the game was developed with an eye to fixing balance by adding more, rather than taking anything away. It's a Frankenstein's monster, edge cases bolted on all over. A few of the bits, such as the second level harvest tech, I don't think are quite right. As always, I also dislike the (unnecessary) luck, such as the building draw.

But of greatest practical concern is that a combination of complexity, changing placement costs, blocking, and 3-6 actions per turn (where order is important!) can make it difficult to plan during other players' turns. With the wrong people this is fertile ground for AP downtime hell. My first game went for four hours, and while that is certainly the fault of an unholy confluence of the wrong players, the game does encourage longer turns rather than micro-actions that keep the pace up. Bring a timer, or maybe a gun.

Despite minor niggles like dying of old age while waiting for my turn, it's a pretty good game. I'm not sure it's a [i]great[/i] game.

I'm generally not a fan of worker placement games, or games with the constant dread of not having enough food to feed your workers, so take this rating with that in mind. The gears are neat though, and there a lot of interesting decisions each turn. On the minus side, if you are playing with anyone who has analysis paralysis, this could go even longer than an already long running time. I think our game went 3 hours which to me is an hour too long.

[RGG 2012 edition] {Mayan; resources-management, worker-placement; optimal 4p} This may not be the best worker-placement Euro game so far (and there are already many ones).  However, I quite like this game because I like the Mayan civilization and this game has a good theme.

As a strategic game, this game offers multiple paths of scoring: temples, monuments, Chichen Itza, etc.  It is a game of timing - one has to plan carefully how to use their workers and to use a turn very efficiently (as it is wasteful to place / pick one work at a time).  Resources (wood, stone, gold, corns and skulls) are tight in this game, one has to plan in advance in order to collect different resources efficiently.

The game is interactive and I would like to play it again soon.

The components are nice:
- the player aid is quite handy, but I wish a cue card to explain the technologies is available;
- the crystal skulls are nice looking;
- the gears are gimmick (at least my daughters like them).

However, it would be even nicer if the worker are made human pawn like (rather than a plain cylinder).
And, it would be nice if a little booklet describing Mayan history is included :P

The cogs, many of you have heard from Tom Vasel (dice tower reviews) that are nothing more than auto advancing on 5 tracks, it is TRUE, but it is VERY IMPORTANT, and i cannot stress that enough.

The thing is, that i stopped playing fungi (morels) because on each turn i had to move 7-8 cards, just to be able to play anything, and if the cogs weren't there, that means that on each turn every player should have been moving up to 6 workers on up to 5 tracks, which would made me stop playing that game. It would be stupid, I want to play game, not work a mindless office job.

That being said, the cogs advance everything that needs advancing per turn, and there is 0 actual downtime due to "technical" stuff, you get the full time from playing the game actually playing the game. IT IS AWESOME how fluidly the game goes.

Another thing I like in this game is that you either take or put workers, you cannot do both, which further more increases the flow of the game, because a lot less thinking is involved AND you sometimes even notice that it is your turn, because the player before you started taking workers and doesn't have any more to take, so you don't even need to hear him saying "I'm done".

I do like the feeding mechanic of the workers, but it feels more like you don't give them food at work, rather then they are starving and don't have what to eat.

I don't like that they haven't put enough tiny baggies for all the different types of components, because without them separated the setup time is increased which is completely unnecessary.

I really like how this worker-placement game makes you think differently about your resources.
Instead of maximising the ROI of each worker (like in most other games) here you really have to restain yourself from "wanting too much". Sometimes it's best to just lean beack in your chair and let the wheels turn. Time is on your side. I really like that.

My best result so far (4 player): 119 points

Very different experience than other typical worker placement games. Ignoring the obvious differences in the gears, the ability to add or remove workers on a turn and increasing costs to put more workers out gives the game a very interesting dynamic. My only complaint is that I'm not sure the game is completely balanced. Some action tracks and buildings pay off a lot more than others of similar costs, meaning whoever rushes the buildings first gets a huge advantage. That just feels a bit off, but the game is still great. My score will probably increase slightly if future plays are different and still interesting.

RATING: 9
Very clever worker placement game packed with options and routes to victory. The game is driven by the placement of workers onto one of five gears interlocked with a central gear which moves every turn. When the workers are removed from the gears they yield whatever they were facing on the board, be it food, resources, victory points etc. There's so much going on here that the number of choices available and how best to use them is genuinely impressive and players have to decide whether to go straight for victory points, construct buildings making the game easier, improve technologies making their worker options more impressive, feed their workers to avoid penalties or to advance through the three temples to gain resources and victory points later in the game. The gears are anything but a gimmick and everything comes together so well making this a clever, demanding and rewarding game that feels quite innovative.

Another worker placement and another resource management game: build the engine, get discounts and privileges, gather resources, convert resources into VPs. Anyway, the game is very solid and has a new fresh aspect of actions progressively better in time. The time management issue is also well done. Benefits of climbing the temples seem to be too high.

I thought I would not like the game but it plays well.  I will say that if you mess up early it can cost you big time.  A good way to learn is play a turn or two and restart.  It is hard to know what to do your first turn but it can be so important.  Right of the bat you have options on starting resources which you really need to play a few turns first before you will have an idea what choice will match your style of play.

A more advanced level of worker placement game, I like how the game make you to think and plan one or 2 turns ahead, the gear mechanic is very unique... makes a lot of players interaction, first timer will get alot of AP moment, but when played with experienced group, it will be fast game, its kinda hard to goes up on the temples but will try to play more to see if this is true..., also the board is one of the most beautiful board in my collection.

I feel kinda the game ended when the engine just started... same problem with keyflower and castle of all seasons.

Purchased @ Spiel 12. A different take on worker placement games. It has some similarities with Agricola - action scarcity and mobile start player - but has plenty of depth. Plays in 60 - 90 mins once all players are familiar with the turn process, and with varying start tiles, monuments and buildings should offer replayability.

tl;dr: still excellent, still unique

This game introduced a new, novel and unique mechanism with the gears that advance the placed workers from one action to the next. Usually when a game introduces something new and unique, it gets copied and reworked and introduced into games the original designers couldn't imagine. As a gamer, I love it when designers let us experience these mechanisms in different ways in different kinds of ways. For this game though, that didn't happen. I understand why though: this is not cheap to produce, but still.
In any case... this game doesn't just have a unique mechanism and use it as a gimmick. No, it's a very solid strategic game in it's own right with a bunch of different strategies to explore. I like it a lot!

Ah, there are some interesting things going on here but I'm not sure it works for me.

The gears are a clever enough way of having maturing workers, so that the value of each space basically increases over time and the ability to buy further around the cogs adds an extra layer of decision-making but there was nothing that really made it stand out for me. The victory point tiles were the same as in a hundred other Euros and this didn't feel like much more than all the other resource collection mid-weight Euros that I've played.

Seems to be just another worker placement game of which there are plenty.  This one does stand out with an interesting timing mechanic of placing your workers and deciding to let them ride to more powerful actions or pull them off and get them on other things.

It was alright, but I didn't see anything in it that made it mind blowing.  I'd play it again, but I wouldn't seek it out.

RATING: 7.7
interesting game, a bit heavy on the resource and block pushing side
The wheels are not as special as they look (just make the block pushing easier).
Of course I like the Maya theme, but not sure if it comes out enough. Sad that the buildings and monuments don't have names and (better) pictures on them for flavor.

The choice in starting resources are a cool mechanic. So everybody gets a little bit different starting point in every game.


in short:
+ Maya theme
+ materials (cool wheels and skulls but the rest not that great)
+ mechanics (especially the starting resource tiles)
0 fancy wheels
- too much focused on resource and block pushing
- should have gone deeper into the theme
- rule book not clear in some cases, possible game balance issues and rule problems

Végre túl vagyok az elsô partin:) Ez is tipikusan az a játék, amelynél a szabálymagyarázat baromi hosszú köszönhetôen a sok akciónak illetve épületnek, amit át kell venni a játék elôtt. Ez viszi el a sok idôt hiszen maga az "alapszabály" marha egyszerû: ha sorra kerülsz leveszel vagy felteszel bábukat a fogaskerekere. 

Azonban ha elkezdôdik a parti, a harmadik, negyedik forduló után már szinte mindegyik akció mezôrôl tudja mindenki hogy mit jelent és így az egész sokkal egyszerûbbé válik. Szóval át kell esni az elsô szabályértelmezésen, de utána szerintem teljesen érthetô és átlátható a játék.

Én úgy érzem, hogy az emlékmû lapkákhoz kell valamennyire igazítani a játékmódot ( magyarán a kirakott emlékmûvek által szabott feltételek  megteremtéséért játszunk az emlékmûvek miatt kapott pluszpontokért). Nem 100%-ban de azért jelentôs szerepe van ennek, hiszen egy jó emlékmû választással 20-30 de akár még több pontot lehet kaszálni a játék végén. És ez nagyon nem elhanyagolható.

RATING: 7
Worker placement, but the workers don`t perform the actions immediately. ON your tirn you pick the workers on the gear or from the gear. When you take them from the gear they perform the action. After a turn all gears roll, and the workes on the weels move to a usually stronger (sometimes only different) action.

So the game is a worker placement where you perform the action with a delay. You cannot wait until the worker moves to the last (best) spot, because you must make an action (pick up from the gear,or put on the gear), you cannot pass.

In every game you randomly choose starting tiles, buildings and monuments. Is this enough for high replaybility? In our game 2/3 players buy only few buildings, and they don`t had a big impact on the game.

Won`t play more. When the replaybility will be high, my rating will go up.

The gears are awesome!But its more than a gimmick because it helps move the game along quickly between rounds and the timing element is very interesting. So many different things to try, different combos. And the expansion adds even more variability. Takes a few plays to even get a decent score. Love to play it!

Not for the AP faint of heart. While turns are fairly straightforward affairs, this is the kind of game where players that tend towards AP are likely going to make this one take longer.

Otherwise, a decent planning game with interesting tactical action. The gears aren't really a new mechanic, just a really good implementation that speeds the game along (as opposed to having to move everything along a track at the end of the turn or whatever).

It's a worker placement game with relatively straightforward paths to victory. Yes, it has gears. Yes, there are timing issues to manage that make the game somewhat interesting. But it's not so amazing as to mask the somewhat slow gameplay and "just another worker placement game" feel. In all honesty, I don't think the designer took full advantage of the gear mechanic. It's not "mean" enough. Only on rare occasions do you move past your desired outcome, and, when you do, you can typically pay to claim the space before. It's a neutered mechanic that deserves to be the center of a tightly focused game about truly tough decision making. Instead, it's just pleasant and clever.

Trajan, another game published in 2012, also involves timing your moves (in a different way, but similar), and manages more excitement. Tzolk'in is okay -- I'd play it on occasion -- but I didn't find it as amazing or innovative as some people seem to.

RATING: 8
This is a worker-placement game with a time element mixed in, implemented with several interlocked gears that actually work (both in the fact that they rotate smoothly, and that the game is very interesting as a result of them).  Timing things out to take bigger turns on average is a key to the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
ts worker placement mechanics are comfortingly familiar, while introducing the element of time makes those same mechanics feel innovative. The gears can attract you from across the room, but there’s much more to the game than those rotating pieces of plastic. And the game is simple at its heart–most turns involve the movement of three or fewer pieces–but the planning necessary to optimize those moves gives the game considerable depth. It’s a very accessible game, that appeals to a wide variety of gamers.

I've found that this game's braincrunch/fun ratio could be better. Still, the innovative design warrants further study.

EDIT: After playing online, it turns out I know nothing about this game, and its necessary braincrunch has skyrocketed. And my enthusiasm plummeted.

The perfect information degrades it into Worker Placement chess. Almost the whole game is plannable from turn #1. :(

Tzolkin came out at a time when I was completely burned out on worker placement and euros in general, so for whatever reason I never had a desire to play it.  But now after a few years, I'm glad I gave it a try.

Tzolkin does so many things right.  Your choices are simple (place guys or remove guys), yet always complicated.  The gears are a great mechanism, visually pleasing, and fun to turn.  The research track is excellent and allows you to form satisfying long term strategies.  The way that you feed your people remind me of Agricola (which I love), yet it's not quite as much of a struggle.  Perhaps my favorite part is that you start with 4 tiles and choose 2 to determine your starting resources/research/buildings.  It's a simple, euro version of variable player powers, which is one of my favorite mechanisms and gives you a direction to follow in your strategies.

I can't really think of anything negative to say about the game.  It captured my attention for the entire game.  I definitely want to give this more plays, and I could see it becoming one of my favorite euros alongside Agricola, Power Grid, and Puerto Rico.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.6
Essentially the workers are accessing more powerful actions each turn they aren't used - while the gear mechanism isn't striiiictly necessary, it's so gosh darn well implemented, thematic, flavourful, euroy goodness. Couple that with great art, powerfully deep strategic options, ramped up difficulty with the whole 'feed your people' mechanism and tech/point tracks. I love me some tracks. It also doesn't have the feel of a heavy, brain burning euro but leaves you feeling just as satisfied.

Just does it for me on so many levels.

Incredible worker placement eurogame with interlocking gears which move each turn--very complex, but never tire of it, with very distinct strategies and random setup element.  Lauren's all-time favorite game, though little known.

I've really enjoyed this the couple of times I've played it. Looking forward to playing it more now that I have a copy, though I suspect it won't be my husbands cup of tea, as he tends to suffer from AP in games where he knows there is the potential to optimize turns if he were to spend the time to do the calculations...and that's the case in this game.

Really interesting action selection game with a twist (sic!).
In my first game I ignored skulls and temples totally while going heavy on buildings and monuments. My scoring was nearby of the winning player who invested heavily in temples, and anotherone who did "skulls". I'm trying to say there seem to be many different equally good strategies.

Interested!
Want to play more!

Worker placement gaming with a truly unique mechanics (the giant gears!). A heavier game that requires a lot of future planning on every turn, but there's also a lot of opponent denial strategy, so if you aren't careful, your best laid plans can go off the rails in a hurry.

RATING: 10
It's not often that I find a game both innovative and enjoyable, but Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar is both. The gear mechanics moving your workers to different action spaces each turn truly is a novel twist that differentiates this game from the host of other worker-placement games out there. Best of all, the gear mechanic is neither a shallow, short-lived gimmick (Niagara, anyone?) nor does it have a fiddly, puzzle-like feel. Instead, it is a clean design that adds some tension and timing to a well-developed game where both strategy and tactics are needed. After four or five games, I have some initial concerns that players fortunate enough to buy the best food buildings early have a tremendous advantage, and that perhaps the placement of the skulls is a stronger method of gaining points than building monuments, but I need more play to determine if this is the case. Other than those possible balance issues, the game is novel, entertaining and challenging. UPDATE: Allowing one player to deliver skulls uncontested absolutely lets that player crush everyone else ... all players simply need to be aware of this. The game continues to get table time on a regular basis and I've bumped my rating up to 9.

This one earns my highest rating.  It's one of the coolest looking games I've seen in a long time.  I've only played it once (3-player game) but found it to be absolutely fascinating and immersive.  The gears are not only cool to watch but they add a great deal of depth and strategy to the game.  There are so many different paths to victory and timing is crucial.  The Mayan theme is strong and the board is beautiful and the game-play is a blast.  I can't wait to play it again!

Tzolk'in gets something hugely right:  when you place a worker, the board explicitly tells you how many turns you must wait to get its benefit.  That alone justifies the entire game.  The rest is slightly less elegant:  myriad tiles to build, three tech trees to pick from, and three point towers to escalate.  That's all fine and dandy but the GEARS are why we're here, and they work brilliantly.

Rating after an incomplete game at Essen, but I think we played long enough to appreciate the game. The timing of the actions is the key to effective worker management, and it is very difficult to achieve (at least, without some practice, I guess). Well, I like my games slightly more shallow, but this is the most innovative game I have seen at Essen. Finally, something new in the worker placement genre. Almost sorry for rating it only 7, but it is just a little bit more deep than I like.

A worker placement game with a fascinating mechanism that is much more than a gimmick. The opportunity to plan ahead long-term makes it a worker placement game heavy on the strategical side. Very much like in Trajan. And also just like in Trajan this planability will ask too much of you to get to grips with the game during the first session. It's quite overwhelming, but so clever and quite rewarding.

Feeling very good about this after just one play. It does a lot of things that I like in a game: technology tracks that give you permanent bonuses; unique worker placement; lots of different buildings that give instant bonuses; different starting resources for each player, every time you play. It also seems to be good with two players, and the rulebook is really well done. Will give this a rating after more plays but expecting it to be a 9 or 10.

Update: Giving this a 10 for now. This game gives me the feeling that it combined some of my favorite games into something special. Worker placement and feeding your workers like in Agricola, building structures like in Caylus, chaining together actions like in Castles of Burgundy. Only the punishment for not feeding workers isn't as severe as Agricola, which is a good thing for me.

I also want to add more about the rulebook. This should serve as a model for how to make a great rulebook. Everything is explained clearly, there are plenty of pictures and examples, there is a nice game flow guide that you can follow for your first few turns to make sure you're doing everything correctly, and the back of the rulebook serves as an illustrated reminder of all of the symbols in the game. Very well done.

Update: Seems like the temples might be overpowered. Sure, there are different methods to advance on the temples, but usually the person who does best on the temples wins by a good margin. Will have to play more to see if this holds up, and if so, hopefully the expansion will address it.

I rate it an 8 after one play. I suspect it could rise with more plays. Take into account that I'm invested in the game because I painted all the wheels before I put it together. It took me about 6 hours of work, but I'm very happy with the finished product.

As for the game, I feel there's a lot to discover there. I took second place in my first play, but I think I could have won with a couple more turns.

The game can be very unforgiving for those who don't want to carefully plan their turns several rounds ahead--or for those who don't do that well. There's a lot of different paths to victory, and I'm excite to play it more to figure some of those paths out.

Also, it should be said that the first play of this game will take at least an hour per player with set-up, rules, and take-down. There's a lot of little things to explain. And you can't just jump right in because important decisions are made by every player even during set-up (tiles are distributed to players and they choose 2 of 4. Those tiles determine each players' starting resources/rewards, which in turn, help determine strategies from the very beginning.)

I look forward to playing it more, and I love that I've painted it, learned it, played it, and will continue to play it with the Mayan people while living in Guatemala. In fact, we're visiting Tikal in three weeks. Very thematic for me.

This game is hard (for me, anyway). I haven't played it once where I felt like I could realize any solid strategies. My wife always seems to jump out early, and keep rolling ahead. It's a bit frustrating at times. But I suppose that's a good thing in a way; it's a challenge for me to master. I'm going to give it several more plays to see if I get any better. For now I'll keep it because it's such a challenge for me to play well. Hopefully I'll be keeping it because I really enjoy playing it. :)

I neglected the temples early to my detriment. At the halfway point I could see I had zero chance of winning, which was disappointing, but that's the nature of learning a new game. It felt difficult to get any sort of engine going, and possibly unnecessary given the temple tracks. The interlocking gears are a cool gimmick, but aren't strictly necessary to accomplish the game's design.

Good condition.

I have painted the center wheel to look like stone. One of the issues with this game is the center cog rubs on the tile beneath it, so that tile has the edge of the cardboard rubbed off. It is underneath the wheel during gameplay so it isn't a big factor, but it is there.

The unique gear mechanism for worker placement is really interesting, but this game is more than just a novelty.  There are several paths to victory - even after 15 games, it feels like there are nooks and crannies to explore - and the variable game setup and player order impact the start of the game significantly.  I'm looking forward to trying out new strategies in future games.

After my initial play I am very impressed. I love games that successfully manage to feel new and unique. This one definately succeeds. The gears used for progressing workers turns out to be amazingly well balanced because of the built in opportunity costs around placement vs. removal for actions vs. timing for ideal actions. That you can only either place or remove in a single turn is in and of itself ingenious. This is definately not a light game if you want to stay competetive. The player interaction is limited to blocking, but is still very effective. Timing is crucial in this game. While there is some amount of engine building, it is not as dominant of an element as in Caylus or in the Harvest Series games. I will be playing this a few more times over the next couple of days but do not expect my rating to change from a 9.

interesting worker-placement brainburner, with a neat new mecanic (the moving weels that connect the game turn progression to the advance of workers in each and every city), that leads to a new flavour of strategic planning. made better by the tribes and profecies expansions, due to the increase in winning paths diversity.

2-4 Players.

Worker placement game where the longer your worker stays on a space, the more actions open up to him. You have to feed your workers, pray to the mayan gods, gather resources to build new buildings, and deposit crystal skulls to get better actions. Requires a lot of thinking! Easy to learn, Tricky to do well.

A solid and unique eurogame.

The game offers simple choices and short enough rules yet quite tough decisions. This leaves room for strategic thoughts halfway through the very first game, which is rare for a euro. By the second game the rules are second nature and all the attention of players focuses on strategy/tactics. The theme is well implemented - full to the sacrifices -  and the artwork/components are quite pleasant to the eye.

Simple (for a euro) yet deep, this is a exceptionally well designed game and apparently one of the best of its kind. I definatelly want to play more!

What I like: 

-The wheel is very innovative and fun! The fact that time and space has become something to account for makes this very unique and fun, and requires a different set of thinking.
-Standard well-produced worker-placement that looks pretty good too. 
-Enjoy that they managed to get it down to 90min of play, which isn't hard to acheive for the players either. 
-I like the deceptive simplicity of just removing or placing workers each round.

What I dislike:

-Nothing changes during the game. What I mean by that is that you don't really get to experience any growth during the game. You are always just place or remove workers. They don't really get stronger or better or different during the game. Yeah you can get more, and become better at some of the wheels, but that is usually just done early game otherwise you aren't being cost efficient with your actions.
-The strategies aren't balanced. Some of the upgrades for the different wheels are just terrible choices and it's hard to know that before you have tried and failed with them. (I strongly recommend AGAINST upgrade the ressource wheel except maybe the first for extra wood), and generally a strategy focused on just building is going to be very poor. 
-The final score is a bit odd. This game is all about climbing on the God tracks. The game rewards you on being highest on each of these 3. This seems okay, but what it usually means is that even though you've had an extremely close game, the one player who gets just a bit ahead on the tracks is going to end up with a massive lead, making it seems like he or she was way ahead. WHereas in reality this just reflects that slight edge on the God Tracks.

Awesome game. 

Every game played feels significantly different thanks to different selections of available buildings and different starting tokens for each player.  There's numerous viable strategies, different engines that you can build and a lot of adaptive reasoning and planning ahead is required to make the best moves at the best times.

The game is not easy to explain to new players and there's a lot of things going on at once.  I'd recommend this game primarily for people who are already experienced in heavy strategy games.  The games can be long, and it can be difficult to recover if you start out by making some bad moves.  

The components, gears and board are all really well designed and nice looking.  The gears on my board got a bit warped and no longer link together properly unless I push them down, which is a bit of a component issue, but not the end of the world.

Overall, great game, highly recommended for players who enjoy heavy strategy.

[url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/126163/tzolkin-the-mayan-calendar]Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar[/url] is, simply, the best euro from 2013 so far, to me. Well, let me be honest: it is the [b]best game overall[/b].

Last year, when the talks about it started, I thought it was just one more game trying to make money by drawing attention to a propitious moment (the end of the world!). And, as most of these, it would be a empty game. Nothing more than a gimmick. But then, lo and behold, people started to say good - very good, even - things about [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/126163/tzolkin-the-mayan-calendar]Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar[/url]. They said that the gears were really useful and smart, not just some eye-candy; that there is, indeed, a solid game in the rules.

And, at last, I had the opportunity to try it first hand. And, yes, it is awesome. Everything on it works together. The actions are intuitive, but, at first, the explanation of the game was scary - there are so much things to be aware of, but even though is necessary to know all of them, they came only one at a time, by the spin of the wheels.

You can gather food and wood; make developments; construct buildings and wonders; pay homage to the Gods; acquire resources - wood, stone, gold, crystal skulls. All of this you can do, and all of them are interconnected and are useful - but you won't be able to use one of the actions in a rinse-and-repeat type of play: you will need food, resources, developments, buildings and appease the Gods.

There is so much to do, and so beautifully connected, that after the game ends, you want to play again, to try new things, ways, to use more of something else.

[url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/126163/tzolkin-the-mayan-calendar]Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar[/url] is, for me, in the same league as [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18602/caylus]Caylus[/url] - or, to translate this: in the top tier of the work-placements.

First game will take longer than expected, This game is a 6-7 in the first play but a 8-9 with experience.  

Some turns are very quick some can take a while, so be in the mood for a though provoking game with some very unique mechanics.  

Not for the uneducated gamer, as they will be smothered in the background.  But if you are a gamer this game has a lot of staying power and will get more efficient and better with multiple plays.  

Also it is a good idea to have an understanding of the buildings and the monuments that are in the game before you play your first game.  it is not a "lets be surprised or figure it out as they come up" type of game. 

Strategies must be discovered early, and it is difficult to change up as time goes on.  

By the way Corn is by far and away VERY important, don't try to jump on late game heroics early, or you will be dead in the water, or Beheaded by the gods as was the way in the Mayan times...!

A well-produced resource management game, feeling more like Pillars of the Earth than Agricola due to the lower pressure (feeding workers isn't that big a burden; there's less that you've "gotta do").

Players have to plan their actions based on the turning of the wheel. It is vital to plan ahead and try to maximise the efficiency of their actions. I enjoy this aspect of the game.

However, I am unable to feel the theme from this game. I am simply collecting resources and then converting those resources to points. Interaction between players are more indirect and is via the placement of the "workers". When it comes to removing the workers from the board, other players are just simply waiting for a player to complete his/her turn.

The look of the game is very nice, the gear mechanism works perfectly, and I'm a sucker for this particular (pasted on, but that's fine with me) theme.

Later, after a few more plays: Still love it, changing my ranking to a 10 for now. For two players, it is a fun mid-weight Euro that I expect us to play a lot.

After 20 or 25 plays: Starting to focus on particular strategies as better than others, making for a less exciting strategic experience. Reaching the point where the expansion is called for, to introduce some new variety. We have the expansion but haven't really incorporated it yet.

After more plays: Yeah, we still love this. Very competitive, still haven't mastered it. One of my top five, for sure.

At its heart, Tzolkin is a worker placement game. The core game is simple to grasp: You either place workers of remove workers during your turn. The interlocking wheels and gears then advances the track over time such that the actions your workers can take become more valuable over time. How long then can you delay your gratification for the workers you place on the wheel?

While the wheel is kinda a gimmick, it does fit the theme quite well and there is no other game out there that has a comparable feel to it. This is high praise given the amount of worker placement games out there. I believe there are different strategies to pursue and I can see both short and long term tactics and strategies for this game. I also can't help but think that optimum strategy lies in being opportunistic in worker placement but also timing everything just right to execute a series of moves to maximize points.

An excellent game worthy of my collection. The only drawback, really is the length of play. This game takes a lot longer than is expected.

Good game but...
Only one play.
Played on 4th position with no corn on tiles.
Other three players managed to place there worker on wheels to get ressources and corn for second turn. I placed only one worker, compared to three for other three players.
Begining the game with minus one turn from other players is not very good for victory. Finished last. after 3½ hours running for nothing after oponents.
To much Analisys Paralisys and you can avoid this if you want to play well. To much down time between players turns.
Won't play it again.

Tzolkin is Stone Age scoring with Manhattan Project mechanics plus a giant gear. The gear is awesome. It turns each round to make each worker perform slightly better so long as they aren't removed from their respective spot.

RATING: 9.5
Simplesmente o melhor "Worker Placement" q joguei até agora, e pelo q eu senti, talvez o melhor q eu vá jogar (e sim, eu já joguei Agricola). A princípio um pouco assustador, pela quantidade de símbolos e engrenagens, mas assim que vc começa a ler o manual e entender o jogo, percebe a simplicidade e inteligência contida alí.
Os símbolos, a princípio muito variados (mais que 7 Wonders) logo começam a fazer sentido de uma forma bem intrínseca, mérito para a arte.
Com um mecanismo simples, mas muito original, e que se integra perfeitamente com a temática do calendário Maya, esse é um jogo na medida certa: tempo, opções de jogada, equilíbrio, diversão e tensão.
E é um jogo bem pensado mesmo para jogar com menos de 4 jogadores, até mesmo com apenas 2, o que não é comum em muitos jogos. E uma das coisas mais fundamentais: fator sorte praticamente zero!
Não é perfeito, talvez não tenha tanta rejogabilidade, e facilitaria se os "Wealth Tiles", buildings e monuments fossem cartas ao invés de tiles, facilitando o embaralhamento. A pontuação em volta tb poderia ter números (não só de 5 em 5) para facilitar a leitura. Mas esses "contras" são meros detalhes técnicos, de implementação do jogo, e não tiram em nada o seu mérito gigantesco. JOGAÇO!

Rated down after couple of plays. This game is extreme working placement - I think it's just not my cup of tea. Was very fun at beginning but after more plays hmmm not as good as first thought.

Cons
- a lot of iconography
- the temples were hard to comprehend on first plays
- too many choices, games seems unnecessarily complicated
- almost no interaction between players

I just feel that it suffers from too many options with too many tracks to try to earn victory point. Iconography also do not make gameplay easier. After 30 minutes I find it boring.

Pros

+ great wheels :)
+ nice theme

I guess I enjoyed this game. For all the nice art and the interesting rotation mechanic, it feels very familiar. There is interaction in rotating the gears twice and in blocking, but it's a game where I can take my turn, walk away from the board, and not really miss much. 

The strategy I took of focusing on crystal skulls and Chichen Itza seemed dominant. 

A game I liked, a solid game, but not one I'm sure that I can love. This is only a first impression, however. I'll reserve final judgement until I've played it more.

Not played in person since 2013. Have played some on Boiteajeux, but it hasn't improved my opinion of it. This is a game where you either have your first ten turns planned in advance or you get steamrolled. Strong meta-game with a half dozen very specific, clearly mapped-out openings / strategies. Expansion helps some, but does so by basically hosing certain strategies... it can't really be used with new players. Looking to trade if I can't get it to the table again.

Always an interesting and tense game. Balancing resources, workers, and corn. When to place workers, where to place workers, when to take them off or let them ride. The gears add a whole time element to planning that is visible to all the players and makes the gameplay interesting.

This game is great to play with others of similar skill.  The learning curve is near asymptotic and the skill cap is nearly non-existent.  Having played against some of the best players in the world for this game felt like an epic beatdown the likes of which I seldom am on the losing side of in gaming.  That said, this is a well balanced uniquely arranged game that is entertaining to play with others of similar skill/familiarity.  If it was quicker to teach I would rate it higher and play with more new players to watch their dawning comprehension after the first game or two as they start to really figure it out.

The board for Tzolk'in is awesome. They very cleverly used gears on the board to help simulate the passing of time in this pretty heavy worker placement game. I've only played this game one time and I really enjoyed it. It's thick with strategy so I flailed around a little bit at the start, but pick it up towards the end. The components are absolutely fantastic. Overall, this is a great game. I can't wait to play it more and I'll adjust my score accordingly, but this just reflects my first impression.

This game is definitely "easy to learn, hard to master" and it succeeds in being my favorite worker placement in a genre that I normally am not too keen on.  It's the quickness of gameplay and flexibility of the board that win me over, among other things.

I really love the temporal aspect of the game, the wheels are far from a gimmick, they eliminate fiddliness and aid the user in planning.  I'm not a big fan of worker placement games, but the way this board is laid out, it really makes this one a bit easier to follow.  Everything is laid out in front of you, you see the last turn counting down, you can easily count turns on the gears.  There's no math you need to work out with multiple workers.

Your moves could be as simple as just taking or placing one worker, but every move has huge impacts on the game and future turns.

This game is the first time I've been inclined to really invest in a game of this complexity long enough to really dig into it's inner workings until it "clicked", I enjoy it more and more with each play.  

Possibly my favorite part is how seamlessly the dummy-worker mechanic allows you to play at any player count.  The only reason why I don't play it too often and why it's not even higher on my list, is because it is a bit of a brain burner so I have to be in the right mood.  

My one complaint about the base game is that it does run out of variability, you can reach a point of overplaying where you start setting up systems that you follow.  The expansion "fixes" this with more variable player powers and the prophecies.

**Update** The expansion fixes my one complaint, the game is now amazing.

1st update (Sep 2013)[9]: I really love Tzolk'in. It's kind of what I wanted Ora et Labora to be with multiple paths to victory and some resource conversion, but it's easier to play and there's some variability in starting setup. I love "timing" as a resource!

The game is a light brain-burner, so don't play tired or you will have a bad time. It can best be described as a non-snowballing cube pusher where the score is built up quite evenly during the game and not by preparing a mega-combo for the final turn(although the "last turn" monument and building builds might be quite valuable). Very enjoyable and possibility for being a fast tempo game played in 90 minutes with 4 players and even faster with fewer.

My single play of this was far from the ideal situation, but I don't see a lot of reason to come back to this game.  The gear components have a nice wow factor, but it's in service to a game that doesn't have much else of interest.  It's a lot of same ol', same ol' convert resources into each other and build stuff.  Mechanically, little is new here -- the worker placement and feeding mechanics are ripped straight from Agricola, the buildings and resources mechanics have been done in oodles of games, and even the gears are just a flashier version of the resource delay system found in [gameid=55670].

While there's a few nods to the theme in terms of named dials and some numbers, there's very little to connect the gameplay to Mayan culture.  It could be seamlessly converted to Old Thyme Builders in Europe without losing anything, and that's never a good sign

I liked this a lot, but I found it very thinky. It's a game that requires precise planning rather than playing on gut instinct, which is what I usually do. In four turns, X will be here, so in 2 turns I need to do Y, and then the turn after that I do Z, so they all trigger simultaneously and I can buy that tile.

I liked it, don't get me wrong, but the think level was so high that it wasn't really enjoyable, if that makes sense.

A lot to digest on your first play, but nothing is too hard.   You're either placing markers on the board OR taking markers off the board to trigger actions/events.

A well executed mix of typical "worker placement" and "resource management" aspects.
It totally lacks anything innovative (the cogs are just a gimmick for workers moving along tracks).
I am also not a fan of having so many resources just for the sake of converting ones into others (to gain bonuses that improve such ratios and so on).

Ten years ago I'd have liked it more. Nowadays, I feel that I won't miss anything by never playing it again (and albeit I won't oppose if it is requested, I'm surely not going to propose it).

Two games: Worker placement game on very colorful board with circling disks. Lots of choices to be done, possibilities for different strategies etc. This does not really hit me, I don't think I'm that good with worker games, and while I'm not good, I don't get good results and I don't enjoy. Most of the time I don't have a real strategy and end up doing this and that. But, I'm ready to give this game one more chance, if offered.

Not a bad game but very unbalanced, much of the point scoring comes from wonders and they are wildly unbalanced. The trading square is a dampener too because it turns what could be a game of careful planning and precision timing into a blatant cube pushing efficiency contest.

RATING: 5
Like many modern euros, my first play with four was 'interesting' but the game subsequently remained unplayed on the shelf for nearly a year. After a second play with two, it was again 'interesting, but don't care if I never see this again'.

It's unthematic, a bit dry, and there's no much draw to bring you back to the table if gaming is about more than 'getting the most VPs'. The game mechanics actively discourage player interaction since you can avoid being blocked by paying corn to jump ahead on the cogs, and get extra resources next turn by doing so.

On the upside, the cogs deal with most of the bookkeeping and it's easy to get on the table. So, if you like dull VP optimisation exercises, it's among the best of its type. Especially good for people who enjoy thinking several turns in advance and puzzling out long-term strategies.

Nice WP game, less fiddly than other WP's. While handsome and fun, not as "deep" as TM say, or Agricola. While there is more than one way to rack up VP's, the winning strategies are pretty straightforward. Still, a fun mid-weight game with its fair share of AP, clocking in at 1-1.5 hrs for two players. I can see it being good with the maximum number of players as well. Love the crystal skulls.

I was afraid that this might be more gimmick than game, but the gear mechanism actually works pretty well.  It's a timer and a tactical element to the game, and it's a good fit for a worker placement game.  There are a lot of things to keep up with and understand in the game, but like most CGE games, all the information you need is represented well on the board.  Teaching or learning the game will take about 30 minutes, though, and it will take a bit for the players to get up to speed.  Once you understand the iconography, it's easy to remember what each bonus and space does for you.

The downtime might be a bit severe as the game progresses, as players try to figure out how to accomplish their plans in the fewest moves, but it seems like it would be about the same as in Agricola, so it doesn't bother me.  Plus, we haven't played a complete game yet, so it's hard to judge that right off the bat.  Still, I want to play it again, so that's a good sign.

The fact that you have to plan how you are going to place or not to place your workers, as well as the fact that you may pay a small price and after some rounds you will gain a better reward are the two favourite highlights of this game for me. I love the components (especially the blue skulls) and of course the wheels. It's definitely worth its money.

First off I love worker placement games. There are two reasons why I put this above most other worker placement games. First I love the rotating gears, it is a brilliant mechanic that makes you think ahead and build a strategy. Second I like the added challenge of only being able to add or remove workers each turn. This adds to the think ahead strategy, and sets this game apart from all the put on and take off (on the same turn) worker placement games.

The cog wheels look interesting. They seem to efficiently take care of some bookkeeping. Add a worker; remove a worker; feed a worker; buy technologies. Not sure game state can be inferred easily. It's a bit of a shame that they used an Aztec wheel rather than Mayan imagery. It's understandable given that the former is circular and the latter rectangular. However, it does stop me from buying the game.

Now this is how you shake the label of "typical stodgy Euro". While gameplay is nothing more than the usual worker placement/resource swap for VP's, the method of delivery is one of the most unique in gaming. The board is made up of interlocking gears, which turn and keep your workers in constant motion. Besides being a very clever mechanic, the big plastic gears are also a hell of a toy. They don't do anything but spin, but when this game hits the table it is guaranteed to draw a crowd.

All of that aside, the game design is quite solid. The iconography is easy to learn and more importantly, consistent. Once you learn to decode a half-dozen tiles or so, the rest just falls into place. Strategically, this feels like a Feld game. There are lots of easy to recognize methods of swapping resources for victory points, which let even a beginner get into the groove and score some points. Of course, the game allows for some huge point scoring opportunities for those that can think three turns ahead and have all of their workers fire off in one action.

I have heard some chatter that the strategies are one dimensional. I don't see that yet in my games, but I certainly understand how it might happen. Still, I think it will take a lot of games to fully unwrap it, not to mention the expansion does a few things to combat that issue. We are diving right in with the expansion, so maybe it won't ever end up like that for us. I'll check back in after a half dozen or so more games...

2 plays. Something is off in the economy of this game.

Further thoughts, now that I know what I like and what I don't like, in particular, about these core Euro games.

I hate the observance for all its moving parts that gets in the way of just *playing* one-another, as in, directly considering the actions, movements and intents of other players and combating them. In Euro games, you have this "just do what everyone else isn't doing" except you sit there and extrapolate what your potential VP net is and how much time you have to achieve it. If you're really good, you'll do the same for everyone else and realise that you either do or don't have enough time, or that too many elements obscure the truth about your potential net VP, so you play out the game often thinking you're doing well only to realise you were 2 turns behind but there was no way for you to forecast it.

That all comes down to poor overall design, but I'm careful when I say that - I acknowledge that designing a game is super difficult, and I applaud anyone who wants to give it a decent shot, it's not easy at all. Nevertheless, I realise that rules overhead and complexity don't always make a great game, especially if the designers can't make all strats viable while also facilitating interaction and pivoting.

I think the sheen of "just doing anything and getting points" has for the most part worn off for me, especially when so many strats on offer will never be truly viable and there's so much channeling.

Tzolkin, a worker placement where the value of the work your workers do evolves over time. As the game proceeds players advance/rotate the gears moving the workers to different action spots. Actions located "later" on the gears are more valuable, so waiting can be good, but being able to pay your workers in corn is more important. 

On their turn players can either place 1(+) workers claim the work from 1(+) workers. The game ends after a revolution of the central gear. To allow for many paths to victory, and variable starting setup for each player, the game has to be a bit fiddly. There is a lot on the board, but it comes together pretty well.

Phenomenal strategic euro game with a unique worker placement mechanic - I love it! Tzolk'in is all about preparation and long-term planning. It's not easy to time your actions perfectly, but if you manage to do so, it will be a very satisfying experience. If you like brain burning games with numerous paths to victory - this one is for you. Keep in mind that the gameplay can be pretty stressful though - you are constantly fighting with time and the shortage of resources.

Definitely lives up to the buzz.  The delayed gratification from the wheels is definitely a cool new mechanic added to the worker placement genre.

I like it!

Edit in late 2013:  After several plays of this, the novelty of the wheels has worn off.  It is really a pretty standard worker placement game with some cool sparkly gears.  The delayed gratification mechanic makes the game interesting, but nothing really spectacular.

I finally had the chance to try this game and I am quite satisfied with the experience.
First the bad things: there aren't many. I just have the slight impression that the game has a limited replayability BUT I could be wrong since there are so many ways you can play your game and this should add variety. What else? well, it's another resource to VP conversion game, so if you are bothered by this... you are warned.
Now the good things: the best aspect is the very good flow of the game. It is fast fast fast and i very much appreciate it. Your action is just "put workers" or "remove workers" and you do this 26 times or so and time goes by very nicely; you are left with the wish of going on playing it again.
It's original in its worker placement mechanic with gradual power up of the workers themselves.
It's well architected: you have to use a very good timing, you have difficult decisions, many strategies to follow. 
It's not very complicated. It seems complicated at the beginning because the board is filled with many things but after a decent explanation everything is clear.
Components are among the top 5 german games i have ever seen. Publishers did an amazing job and every detail has been taken care of in the best possible way. The cogs are so nice, they fit wonderfully well and usually (not always) they do not get stuck.
You obviously need a couple of games to understand how to play it well but since the first game you can enjoy it quite a lot.
All in all, a very good experience: you must try it soon or later.
Why not a better rating? well, I don't like games that are too rich and that contain too many things so i need a few more games to get used to it and "digest" it completely: but the rating can't do anything else but rise.
Good job Daniele and Simone!

The components for this game are great. I find the gear mechanism quite exciting, since it makes for a lot of interesting decisions. I also like the resource management aspect.

If I get to play it more without the stress becoming an issue, I will probably bump up the rating.

The rules explanation can take 30-45 minutes the first time, but the gameplay itself is really straightforward: place dudes on the board or take dudes off the board. If you have someone who can explain it to you well, give Tzolk'in a try. It's not as hard as it first appears.

Worker placement with a twist; on your turn, put workers down or pick them up, but not both.  The longer you leave the workers down, the better the reward.

It is not for people who can't think ahead, because the game is all about, I place worker to be able to do X later. Very strategic game with no luck beside initial setup and the new building coming up when you build one.

Good game, but pretty fiddly if you ask me. Could it be, have I hit the worker placement wall?  Games like this one have to grow on you.  Most people will have no idea what to do the first few times.  The problem with this (because this isn't always a problem) is that you see no results doing what you are doing unless you get and place crystal skulls (which is only one way to get points).  So the learning curve is huge.  And then there are exceptions to getting things which make things confusing.  So I get the game.  I get why people like it.  And I get how this game would get better with more plays.  But I think there are better worker placement games out there, especially for the new player.

Very good game. Quite a few strategic options and lots of possibilities for interesting tactical plays. The flow of the game is very smooth and despite many interesting decision it is surprising that it does not trigger huge AP delays. My gaming group plays this in just under 2h (and in general we are very slow) and it probably has one of the best "intellectual fun bang for my time buck" ratio.  

Although thematic connection doesn't seem strong especially during rules explanation when you play it somehow your actions make sense. This not a small feat on the designer part.

And on top of all that it looks really great.

RATING: 6
A worker placement, resource conversion sort of game but the twist is that workers are placed on cogs, which rotate as the game progresses, allowing access to better actions. Underneath the cogs it's not hugely different from other resource conversion games but worth taking a look at.

On your turn you can either place workers or remove workers, not both. If you have no workers in your supply, you must remove some from the board and vice versa. When placing workers, they must go on the first available space and the idea is to leave them on the cog until it has spun around to the action you want. There's a food cog, a building materials cog, a "build stuff and advance your technologies" cog, a points scoring cog and an "other stuff" cog.

There are harvest rounds where you have to feed your workers or lose points; there are building tiles you can build for points or other benefits; there are four technology tracks you can advance on to augment your basic actions; and there are three temple tracks on which you can jockey for position with the other players. The temples pay out points and/or resources in harvest rounds. If you've played Stone Age, Agricola or Caylus, you'll have a good idea of what much of this game is like. But what makes it different from those games is the cogs.

I can imagine the designer playing Agricola and thinking "what if I could leave my Family Member on that 3 Wood space for an extra round and get 6 Wood next turn instead?" That's what this game does, but your worker doesn't block the space while it's waiting there. The cogs are an elegant way of implementing this idea and there's a good bit of tension between wanting your worker back for use elsewhere and wanting to get a better reward by keeping it there. I think the cogs are great, but I was a little disappointed they weren't put to more use. I'd have liked to see the ratios between different sized cogs being a bigger feature, or an option to move to a different sized cog within the same group of actions, or even the option of moving from one cog to a smaller connected one.

There's a subtle and interesting interaction between players regarding where they place their workers on a cog. You have to play on the lowest available space (often the 0 space), but that means you'll be waiting longest to get the good actions. You can start off on a higher space only if all the spaces before it are already occupied and even then you have to pay some extra food for the privilege. As the start player is the one to rotate the central cog each turn (which correspondingly rotates all outer cogs by one space), they will always have the 0 space free. This can be a good thing if they wanted to get on a certain cog but didn't mind whereabouts, but it can also be a disadvantage if they wanted to start higher along the cog - they’d have to place on the 0 space before they could place further ahead too, and placing multiple workers in one turn costs more food. To counter this, using the Start Player action lets you pick who will be the Start Player, as you might not automatically want it to be you. Sometimes you hope an opponent leaves their worker on a cog so that you can place above them on your turn. Other times you might want them to vacate a space so you can access that cog at a lower cost. There are a lot of moving parts to this game and not just the cogs on the board.

Theme/Art:
I like the theme a lot, I was always interested in Aztec and Mayan culture. The theme also fits the game and the game looks great and colourful.
The art is great too, especially the box art.

Production quality:
Very good, the board itself is very unique and the gears work very smoothly. Resources are basic wooden cubes, aside from wood and corn, which are cardboard tiles, and crystal skulls, which are little plastic skulls. Everything else is cardboard.

Replayability:
Since Tzolk'in has a lot going on and quite a few ways to score points, replayability is given. Additionally the order of buildings and the available monuments are different every game.
The expansions adds even more replayability with different tribes and prophecies.

Depth/Difficulty:
The core mechanic of the game can be explained in one sentence: On your turn you either place workers on gears or take workers off gears to receive the benefit of the gear space you took them from. However, there are a lot of different gear spaces to learn and there are also gods, technologies, and harvest festivals.
I weight it 4/5.

Strategy:
You need to think ahead, manage your resources, keep workers on gears as short as possible, but as long as needed to get the best benefits. It plays very fluid though, because turns are very short.

Luck:
Pretty much non existent. Aside from starting tiles, buildings, and monuments nothing in this game is random.

Tzolk'in is an amazing game and depending on player count it takes 60-150 minutes to play.

I think the gears are a great and unique way to implement a worker placement mechanic and I can't wait to get the expansion.

Complex worker placement game with really interesting cog board mechanism. The rules are relatively easy to learn but the strategies felt overly complex and required too much deep thinking, slowing the game down lots.

Simple worker placement with a ton of depth and WONDERFUL art design.  Thirty points will seem like an accomplishment your first play.  Then you'll see someone score 150+ and holy shit....

RATING: 7
It is a well-designed game that adds a new and brain-breaking twist on worker-placement. Player interaction/interference can detail strategies. The significant gap between expert and journeyman players prevents it from being an 8 (always willing to play) for me.

Great mechanic. You try not only to win, but also to achieve a new high score.
The luck of theme and the downtime prevents me to rate it higher.

The gears are a neat idea, but it's still a worker placement game. There just seems to be a bit too much going on for it to be anything more than "meh" for me. With how the turns work, you don't get to do much on your turns, which is a bit disappointing. On the plus side, it plays pretty quickly. Aside from the gears, it just doesn't do anything that other games in my collection don't already do better.

From Essen 2015

I got it painted and printed some 3D pyramids for it! Still...

It's a good game, but it breaks my head to play it. Every single decision is not for the present, for "right now". Instead, you have to thing on 4 or 5 different moments ahead, all at the same time. To make it worse, beside have 4/5 timelines-balls to juggle in the air, you have to juggle various paths to victory, various ways to get what you need, etc.
Too much. I'd love to see a version of these gears but in a easier game.

I have been intrigued by this game for quite some time but it always seemed to fall to the wayside for other games that I was more excited about. The fact that it has been able to stand the test of time over these past few years in BGG's top 100 is only more reason for me to be excited about it. Thank you to PiFF for finally getting me to try out this game.

The gears look great, the mechanism is nice, but it's mechaic isn't transporting over to the game feeling. For me to much optimation and a feeling during 2/3 of the game, that there is no development. Despite it's clver board, a clear no buy for me

Throughout the years of playing this game, I have found that this is still one of my top games of all time.  I have literally played this game hundreds of times and even though my thoughts on the strategy of this game have grown, developed, and changed, my rating has only increased (started out as a 9).  This is an excellent game. I love how there are so many things going on in the game at one time.  There are so many things to take into consideration when you're making your placements or removing your workers. At the beginning of the game you have to look at the monuments, choose your strategy, and try your best to execute it.  The game revolves around three main methods of strategy: corn, skulls, or buildings.  You can win and score big pursuing multiple combinations of the three, but I have found that it is best to stick with one.  Buildings are widely known to be "the best" overall choice because you can score the highest points by pursuing them.  Throughout my plays, I have found this isn't true.  Skulls are definitely a viable option and I regularly beat building players by pursuing a skulls strategy.  I will say that this is a game where if another player is pursing the same strategy as you are, both of those players are going to suffer.  Also, start player is a big advantage because you can get the fourth worker right away (which is huge).  I do feel like a variant for balancing start player would make the game tighter and slightly more balanced.  With these criticisms you may think that the game would be rated lower, but the fact is that it isn't because the overall design, engaging gameplay, and unique gear shifting mechanic, make this an exciting and unique worker placement experience that feels unique and creative.  The technology upgrades are something that you don't usually see in a worker placement game. The game feels very tight but at the same time, you always feel like you have options that will benefit you.  A smart player is always reading their opponent.  Sometimes you don't place a worker(s) in a spot(s) because it only will serve to benefit your opponent's overall strategy.  In early games, you might feel like the temples are the determining factor of who wins.  The more you play, the more you see that developing your long term strategy, whether that involves temple pursuit or not, is the most effective form of victory.  You should always pursue more workers, and try to advance the  technology that will suit your end game strategy ASAP.  Don't hesitate to buy this game.  It is an amazing game design that I would love to see other designs emulate.

Complex worker placement game. The moving cogs are not only a cool gimmick but also make thematic sense, since they represent time passing.

The gears and main game mechanic are very well-done. Indeed, its strongest point is how the main game mechanic handles the time element. Game component quality is high, but the artwork is pretty average. The gears and how they are attached to the game boards mean setting up a game requires a tad more time and care. There are many icons in the game, which takes a little time to get used to. 

Theme is almost non-existent, lending the game a somewhat gimmicky feel. In particular, the scoring categories are disparate, lacking in cohesiveness, resulting in the game feeling rather piecemeal. The amount of downtime can be very high. Player interaction is low and was largely indirect.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Really nice production and the gears lead to some headaches. It's hard to get a feel for the flow of this one since it is unlike many other games. In the end it's a goods to points converter where the theme is pasted on. I felt like it was a solid strategy game but I didn't really have much fun playing it.

Un euro más bien durete a pesar de que sólo puedes poner meeple o quitar meeple, hay una loseta que da 3 puntos por cada calavera de cristal puesta en la rueda azul al final del juego que me parece muy over (me gusta jugar sin ella ya que le da muchísimos puntos a quien la compra).

+ Tribus y profecías.

Excellent game! deserve a higher spot. A heavy game that play faster and is simpler than most other game with the same weight, thanks to the brilliant wheel mechanic. imagine Agricola if you didn't have to fill the board every turn. you saved time and avoid mistake. Easy to learn but very hard to play, this title is a real brain burner which i don't mind at all.

Very cool game, and such a unique take on the worker placement genre. I love the mechanisms and the ideas here, and the game itself is so solid and enjoyable. It's just so fun to look at, even, like some crazy toy! But beneath that toy there is a strong design. The symbology takes a little bit of time to get used to, but overall, it made sense. Excellent game.

This game was a hype, even before it was released. Only because of the gear mechanism. When the big wheel has made one full turn (this will take a while), the game ends. For the rest, it’s a worker placement game. As there are dozens out there of those games, it has to be really good, to fulfill the expectations this game has given us. And to be honest. It didn’t fulfill our expectations. It’s nice, it’s fun, but the game relies too much on the gimmick of the turning wheels. When you don’t expect anything of this game, you might be surprised, and you’ll get a nice worker placement game. We’re pretty sure that this one goes on sales in 1 or 2 years.

The gears are not as gimmicky was you would think, they do add some twists to the worker placement mechanic.  Lots of neat ideas here.  However, I felt the game would have been more enjoyable if the resources had been loosened a bit as too many turns were spent making forced, inefficient moves rather than more interesting ones.

Another worker placement-with-a-twist, a la Stone Age or Egizia.  Place dudes to gain cubes, then place dudes to convert cubes for points. 

The twist here is the five interconnected gears.  You place on the lowest notch of a gear, and each turn you leave your guy unused he powers up a notch.

So pretty.  Love the gears and the board and the "crystal" skulls.  But DAMN, the analysis paralysis of this game...

The gears and your opponents demand quite a bit of planning with a dose of speculation; however, screwage isn't too bad in this, because you generally can get what you want for a little more, and/or a little later.  Mesmerizing!

This is close to the vaunted "10" status, but in my plays, I've found that the skull strategy is possibly too strong, not so much because of the VPs from the skull, but because of the skull technology track boost for pyramid steps.  I rarely house rule, but I've been considering one here.  Just not sure what to change the second step of religion technology to.

One of my most beloved euro’s because of the excellent planning ahead concept. In x turns that worker is going to generate x resource is the fundamental brick of the game. There’s about 5-6 different strategies to run. Might buy expansion later since that one adds more variability.

Probably the best worker placement game I've ever played. It is incredibly thinky due to the temporal element of worker actions, yet very simple. The rules are easy to grok and the gears keep things from being fiddly. Let me be clear though, it is VERY thinky and can be hard to wrap your mind around, but that's due to the strategy and not the rules. It's also a lot more forgiving than Agricola, though it does have a similar feed your workers requirement.

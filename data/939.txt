GAME: Star Wars: The Queen's Gambit
RANK: 540

RATING: 8
Even not having a single clue about the movie scenes we were somehow re-enacting (I'm not a big Star Wars fan) I really appreciated this game since my first play: simple rules, a good amount of luck and a fair number of viable options each turn pave the way for a really fast paced gameplay, with negligible downtime, lots of fun and - often - really close victories. The lightsaber duel seems a bit static, maybe too simplified, and playing time can sometimes be long. Luck IS present, with a strong preponderance on Anakin's path to the capital ship, but the game still rewards good tactics and strategy in adapting and balancing your resources. The two sides seemed quite balanced so far. Ideal with 2.

Gorgeous components. The soft plastic the figures are made of is simply irresistible: during each game I find my hands compulsively manipulating the nearest miniature on any given opportunity. The palace can sometimes require exactly four hands (or similar appendages) to be assembled quickly, but the complete set-up makes the game look great.  May the Force be with the cards: they seem solid, but their borders look a bit prone to loose quickly their integrity. Minor complaint: I would have preferred pre-printed dice, but Kudos for the extra components included in the box. Nice rulebook, well written and properly illustrated: may seem a little long for what the game has to offer, but a single, careful reading may become the only one you will need during the whole game.

I did like this one, even if it is a dice fest.  balancing the four battles (or rather 3 battles and one race puzzle) was an intriguing system.  Jedi battle seems slanted towards the naboo player, but the battlefield seems to be in the federation's favor.  Great bits, and clever dice system.  Tower is unnecessarily rickety.

Playing this game brings up terrible and forcibly forgotten memories of the movie, but the game is great. Sort of like War of the Ring, with a set setup and multiple things going on that you have to pay attention to, but also very similar to Star Wars: Epic Duels, in that you activate units by playing cards that say you can. It's better than Epic Duels, though, in that it is much more strategic and the cards almost all have more than one use (e.g. a card that lets you activate 3 battle droids OR Darth Maul, or a car that lets you put out a droid starship in the space battlefield, or activate a droid tank on the grassy battlefiled).

An OK game, With some nice plastics. Thats about it. The game give you the sense of handling 3 arenas at the same time, but 'controls' you with the cards in hand.

Wonder if you are playing the game or the cards are playing you.

Reasonable fun for the theme, but not a game I will return to again and again.

RATING: 9
The board game is better than the movie. Seriously, so much better.

I love how Queen's Gambit captures the story of episode one. It brings the strategic conflict of the movie to life. The only downsides are that the game is biased towards a Naboo victory. True to the source material! But I would prefer more balanced sides. And I wish that Anakin's attack on the Trade Federation ship was more than just a dice game.

But seriously! This game is crazy. Awesome components. Really fun card play. The combat is pretty straightforward, but the design is so unique. If only it was reasonably priced to still purchase...

WHile the ton of miniatures the game comes with makes it very appealing, the structure is a bit too random: the cards decide which unit you will move on the various battlefields. Nonetheless, this is a must even if you are only interested in miniatures from starwars!

This is a good game beside some small problems. most of the time the jedi battle winner determines who wins the fight unless the one standing jedi is very weak. Also, the Anakin portion of the game is slightly annoying as it is nothing like the rest of the game.

RATING: 7.5
This is an excellent light wargame.  Like most wargames it is asymmetrical, but unlike many light games of this type it is well balanced.  The only reason I haven't rated it higher is because it takes awhile to set up and I have a toddler that becomes very unhappy when she isn't allowed to play with all the pretty figures.  This game is enjoyable for adults and children although it may be too light for hardcore gamers/grognards.

RATING: 7
{1 play, 4 players} Really enjoyed my first game of this, especially the team play.  But... we simply could do no wrong when it came to rolling - the dice just fell our way almost every single time - so I'm not sure I got in a "real" game of this yet.

An impulse buy. Hearing of an "actually good Star Wars game", I had to secure it.

Does everything Memoir '44 does and then some. Epic in scope, covering four fields of battle at once. Easy to pick up with a lot of strategic options. A bit dicey, but forgivable. Well worth the price of admission (which is steadily increasing with its OOP status)

The winner is determined by the Anakin die rolls, but I still enjoy playing this luckfest.  I equally enjoy playing as either the Naboo or the Trade Federation.  As far as gameplay, I find that Queen's Gambit is sort of the Die Macher of the Commands & Colors' system!

A game consisting of four little, mostly seperate games. Two of them are stupid (Anakin's flight to the control ship and the battle with Darth Maul) and the other two are nice. Lot's of SW atmosphere though.

RATING: 7
One playing.   Very good card driven "wargame" based on episode one.  Much better than the movie.   It has the look and feel of two or three different games at once and one must balance each area to allow them to be successful in all.  If you spend too much time concentrating on one area over another, you will lose valuable ground.  I really enjoyed my one playing, it was a lot of fun and easy to get into.  My only concern is replayability.  I wonder if it could hit the table more than once every four to six months without losing it's lustre.  However, I'd play it every four months and have a riot each time.

RATING: 10
Take this comment with a grain of salt since I am a huge Star Wars fan.  But this game captures the theme SO well.  I can really feel the tension and I imagine the events from the movie as they happen on the board.  I have very few games that actually get me so involved that I'm making sound effects during the game and trying to recreate the motions I've imagined in my head, but this one gets me doing that.  I have totally recaptured my childhood through this game and will continue to seek opportunities to play it again.

If I were to make any complaint it would be that the game takes awhile to set up and requires me to set aside a special night to play because it is sort of long too.  Those are minor quibbles when compared to the awesomeness of this game.  I find myself anxiously anticipating the next game as soon as I finish playing.

Theme, theme, theme and then some more theme!!! This is an Ameritrash game that has some great production values. There is a 3-D board included! 

When you are in the mood for a fun, thematic, dice-fest game with a Star Wars theme in mind and some interesting decisions; look no further! If you are a die hard Euro gamer, proceed with caution or bring a different mind set to the table.

Beer not included!

Initial Impressions
---------------------
This game has that special look when on the table.  Its a game that when people walk by, they stop and look.  The theme comes through perfectly as well.  Best Star Wars Boardgame out there (so far... come on FFG!).  Really like the tension in this game, as every card / roll seems so important.  The game does offer a ton of interesting choices.  Have only played the Naboo forces so far and lost twice.  Looking forward to many more plays of this very good 2p game!

RATING: 7
Cool minis, lots of theme, and several fronts to manage. A dice-fest that is actually great fun. 

Its major weakness is too much reliance on luck-o-the-draw for your hand cards and on guessing dice results for Anakin's assault. Oh, and that towering palace, while cool, is a big nusiance. One misplaced hand and pieces fly everywhere.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Remarkably ambitious and fun game emcompassing the final battles from the Star Wars movie, The Phantom Menace. Players essentially play four mini-games simultaneously to capture the Queen of Naboo or repel the Trade Federation Army. Part Battle Cry, part Epic Duels. The first few games can take awhile as you learn the rules, but experienced players can knock out an action-packed game in an hour.

The 'best thing to come out of Episode I' is not far off the mark. Although it's a ridiculous pain to set up (and play in certain parts with the three levels leading to inevitable bumps and resets) once ready, it's a hoot. I recommend watching the movie or playing the soundtrack while playing

Suprisingly fun Star Wars themed game.

Nice 2-player game themed totally within the Star Wars galaxy.  You play either the Trade Federation or the Rebels.  Your goal is to shut down all the droids brutalizing the population of naboo and you work at this on 3 fronts using a card driven mechanic.

The 3 fronts are within the ship with the Trade Federation reps (and Quigon and Obiwan), the actual droid battle ground, and Anakin's flight toward the droid control center.

The game is very balanced in that aspect and can change very rapidly.

Light.

Decent, but I think more modern dice chuckers (like The Others or TMNT) offer more breadth with a similar level of strategy. Good for a Star Wars: Episode 1 experience, and just generally a game with awesome presentation, but as I'm not a Star Wars fan, not a must-keep for me.

I really expected this game to suck, given that it features (sigh) plastic Gungans.  It's loads of fun, though!  The gameplay is top-notch -- like a slightly more complicated Memoir '44 with better balance and many MANY more options.

RATING: 8
Great thematic match to the story.  Brilliant weaving of the four scenarios into one game. Some luck, yes, but have played games that went down to the last shot or stroke - very intense endings! Sometimes a little lengthy if Anakin doesn't get the right dice roles toward the droid ship. The only game I can play with a lot of dice rolls and still have a blast (i.e. - I can't stand Risk).

2016  An amazing Ameritrash adaptation of the final climactic scenes from Episode 1. Ease of mechanics of the command and colors system, but more gameplay depth over 4 different battlefields.

Oh my gosh, I love this game so much. Not just because of the setting (I'm a Star Wars geek but Episode 1? Ew...) but the game itself is so cool.
Fighting four battles at a time with limited ressources that you always feel the struggle of "winning one battle but loosing another" and won't know until the end wich decision was right.
The mechanics are really simple and the game is ultra high luck based but besides of that it is a great strategy game where you hope that your strategy doesn't get beaten by (bad) luck.
If you can get it somewhere for a low amount...then get it!

Mechanically this is a Command and Colors game with 4 different sections of the battlefield.  Theme-wise this is perhaps the strongest game I own and is just so damn cool when setup.  Tons of miniatures, the most awesome 3D board, and some really clever small touches that are exceptional.  I'm a diehard original Trilogy fan and find little worth in the prequels(although Episode 1 was the least bad in my opinion), and other prequel haters I have introduced this to loved it as well.  It's the Steve McQueen of Board games and it just oozes cool.

The card play is the strategy, but bad rolls will kill you.  A longish setup, but seems worth it once you're actually ready to start.
Really 4 mini games...
* Plains battle where either side can get extra actions (in the other battles) for destroying groups of units.
* Space battle where Trade Fed. player tries to block good player from making it to the 6th spot, where all TF robot units will deactivate and be destroyed. That's everyone except Darth Maul & the 2 Viceroys. Really the clock of the game, because if good guy does this, then TF player is in big trouble.
* Reactor core jedi battle where 2 good vs. 1 bad (usually 1 of each die with remaining good fairly wounded). The winning jedi can leave and go help in palace.
*Palace Battle where a bunch vs a bunch. Object for good is to get more in Throne Room than bad guys. No good guys are ever replaced, so if enough good are killed, they cannot win.
Close game every time we've played.

They did a really wonderful job of capturing the "many things going on at once" feeling from the end of phantom menace - not that it was a great movie or anything ;)  The gigantic gungan battle with what feels like more than half the minis is almost completely pointless- but the cards make you play there occassionaly and its just awesome.  Losing the Jedi battle can hurt and the second floor is castle is also awesomely useless.  Its really just a dice chucker with cards coming from two decks telling you where the battles will take place.  Its actually  quite the fun time.

The starfighter goal acts much like a timer (perhaps like the ring in WOTR) which counts down how long you have to complete other goals.  Eurogame purists probably wouldn't like it, but there's enough going on that it isn't just a kids game.

Theme and glitzy bits carry this game a long way. I wish the three-level battlefield wasn't so easy to knock over, but otherwise the components are quite impressive.

There is a lot of dice-rolling...and I'm not sure the game isn't possibly broken in favor of the rebels, but its just about the perfect game to play with my 7 year old son. He loves Star Wars, he is able to read the card text...and make his own decisions which influence game play. And he can win. 

Given the choice of only this one or Assault on Hoth...and its a tough choice. I think maybe Queen's Gambit gets the edge purely on components, while Hoth has the better theme. Both have similar complexity/decision-making and play time.

This game is a blast to play, great feeling  of simultaneous action taking place...it's better than Epic Duels as far as I'm concerned as it just has more depth...well, a little more.  Tons of luck, but that's OK...sometimes careful planning pays off and sometimes it just doesn't.  My main complaint is that it's not a classic trilogy game as it can be hard to convince my crew to play a "prequel" game!

The end game of this always drags out too long.  I feel like 1-2 times through the deck is fine.  After that, there is usually a remote chance of one side winning and an almost sure chance of the other side winning, and you have to wait it out.

The theme ruled this game on my first play as I played the "bad guys" and destroyed the gungans on the battlefield and killed Qui-Gon and then in the end had the Queen jump from window ledge to window ledge and beat me... Excellent.  I am sure if the rules allowed for it, Anakin would have blown the Trade Federation ships on the next move.

When this game came out I knew I had to have it. As a Star Wars fanboy the minis just overwhelmed me. And as an added bonus this game is the best Film to boardgame
adaptation that has ever been made. The film plot is so
encaptured in the general game play that I have no regrets purchasing it double up. Now that the Star Wars
miniature game has come along I can make any Star Wars
scene that my mind desires. From massive clone wars
battles to tight laser sword fights. This is a grail game
for sure. Check out Star Wars: Epic Duels as well for
more Star Wars figs and a fast playing fun game to boot.

The Queen's Gambit, aka the only good thin that came with the Star Wars prequels. Indeed, it's a light game, but it works perfectly. You have four battles to focus on ad each card played helps a story to be unveiled. Some of you may hate me, but I bought it in 2014 at a yard sale in Utrecht, spending less than 10 euros. One droid figure was missing, but who cares.

Overall its a few things:

1) A bit one sided. I think the Dark Side is a bit better situated to win the game due to regeneration type stuff.

2) A dice fest, which I like... dice fests.

3) Rather good. I think I would play this game again 2 player... 4 player I don't think this game would do very well. But overall a good gaming experience with some interesting tough decisions to be made.

Also I think this is one of the games where you can check it off and say you played it. *check*

Captures the feel of the horrible Episode I perfectly.  Turns out, in game form, I can sit through it.  Jarjars die in droves (both sides can enjoy).  Lightsaber fight and tower thingy are a hoot but the Ani starfighter is completely soulless despite how important it is.

One of the best "Star Wars" games ever designed.  Amazing components, prototypical rules clarity, and an overall "cinematic" experience. Undoubtedly the best thing to result from the otherwise horrendous "Phantom Menace."  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I want to love this game (and I sort of do).  But the game mainly hinges on the outcome of the jedi duel (which is heavily weighted towards Obi Wan and Qui Gon though one of them usually dies).  The remaining one can kill hundreds of droids.  Also, the Naboo player has MANY cards that allow a queen or Panaka (who attack with better dice) and 3 guards to attack compared with the standard 1 or 2 droids who can attack.  Also, the 2 queens and Captain Panaka take a total of 18 hits (and they can heal a bit too) so it takes a lot to take them out.  I won the first game as the Trade Federation (barely) and I came close in the 2nd game (3 people left...but Obi Wan killed everything near him and his cards never run out).  I think I only won due to inexperience on the part of the other player.  We will see how the next two games turn out when I am on the other side.  Great game, great concept...do not know if the play balance works though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
O.K. I'm a Star Wars fan but I thinks this game is often underestimated because it have all a gamer can wish of. A nice board, a lot of pieces, dice and cards to deal with, a good balance between luck and strategy and (of course) a terrific theme ! And don't forget the rules: they are easy to learn     .
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of the best Star Wars games ever made.  One can fault it being a bit luck heavy or light, but one has to respect the bits and the attempt to have decent gameplay map to the movie.  Near universally agreed to be better than the original movie.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The best part of George Lucas's first film in the Star Wars prequel trilogy was the last half hour or so when he skillfully interwove four separate battles: the Jedi vs Sith duel, the Queen of Naboo's attempt to retake her palace and seize the usurping Trade Fed leaders, the Gungans fight against the droid army on the plains outside the city, and the desperate assault on the droid control ship by the Naboo space forces. This game does an excellent job of mirroring those same situations by using card play to force players into difficult decisions about what areas to concentrate on each turn.

Component quality is excellent, from the horde of plastic minis, to the attractive cards, to the very cool 3D board for Theed palace.  

Even though it ultimately comes down to how quickly the good guys can draw and play the Annakin space cards and how well they roll going up against droid spacefighters, the gameplay is fun and tense and given to lots of Star War-quoting table talk.

A winner - one of the very best Star Wars related games.

I'm not sure why I like this game so much.  There's lots of dice rolling, yet it just seems to work somehow. The game has a lot of theme and sweet bits!  I wish the Anakin track was a little less abstract and luck-driven..but I'm not complaining.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun, and rather exciting game themed on The Phantom Menace movie.  The game features the four battles that were occuring during the end of the movie (space, plains, palace, jedi) and each battle has a subtle effect on the outcome of the game.  Cards activate the dozens of plastic pieces, allowing them to move and fire via simple die roll/hit allocations.  This is good stuff.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
[Van Ness / Daviau] An insane number of cool little miniatures does not save this game. I love simple wargames and don't mind the random element at all. The interactions between boards are pretty cool, but the four games themselves are poorly done. The Jedi battle is nothing more than a slugfest. The race game is utterly uninspired. The Gungan battle is awful. The pieces move too slow in the palace battle and the heroes have too many HP's. Oh, and as far as play balance is way out of whack. Probably a good father-son type game (movie theme, let the kid be the Jedi, etc), but I wouldn't recommend otherwise. Play Epic Duels instead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I initially passed this one over because I assumed it was probably just another crappy game trying to cash in on a movie license.  The positive reviews made me take another look, and I'm glad I did.  This is a very good, tense, but light wargame that essentially uses a Battle-Cry type system to conduct 3 battles at once.  It sounds overwhelming, but really it works very well as the card draws limit your choices each turn.  My wife loves this game!  I'm especially impressed that the two sides are so well balanced even through they have completely different units and goals.  The game progression may be somewhat too dependent on the randomness of the Anakin track, though.

Just truly an amazing game and a shame that it will never see a reprint. It can't be rethemed because it is so closely tied to the movies it would be an impossible task. And with Episode 1 long gone from the collective mind it lacks any sort of marketing tie. What is truly amazing about this game is that it told me more about what was going on in the movie than the movie did. I'm usually not one to tie everything together into cohesion and Episode 1 was no different. What this game did though was tie everything together and allowed me to see just how everything going on at different places were related and impacted one another. That to me is a trait of a solid design, that it provides further insight into the source material.

One the best movie inspired games ever made that is thematic and tense. Some may not enjoy it as much if they don't like the Phantom Menace but I do. The only weakness is that the Anakin player will have a huge advantage if he/she takes out Darth Maul early; e.g., I was able to do this recently by my 5th card (1st card of the second round) with Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon still alive to wreak havoc on the palace. I was able to play/draw the right cards, roll better than average, and the Darth Maul failed to block well - rolling below average. Thus, for inexperienced players, I have to play the Trade Federation because I will still keep playing if this happens whereas other players may quit.

Fun, played twice (one 2er and one 4er).  It took a little too long for what it was, with all the dice rolling and everything.  I still enjoyed it, but my wife did not enjoy getting crushed.  She loved destroying me the 2nd time with partners, though.  Better than Epic Duels.  Excellent toy factor.  Kind of reminds us a bit of Shadows over Camelot, with the teamplay aspect, the different boards/battles, and the minis (albeit many more).  Probably won't see many plays, 5-6 I estimate before growing tired of it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Acquired 9/16/05.  I love this game.  If it doesn't make you feel like a kid again, your heart turned to stone a long time ago.  Can't wait for my kid to get a little older so he can enjoy it with me too.

I found a copy of this game on sale at the FLGS after I moved back to NWA.  I put in a solo play to try it out and I think it lives up to most of the good reviews here.  The way that the battlefield and jedi duel don't count for victory, but can have an important effect on the palace that does count for victory forces the players to make interesting decisions as to where to concentrate their effort on any given turn.

I definitely look forward to playing this with an opponent.

I've gotta say, that I am so happy, that I finally pulled the plug and purchased this game. It was worth every damn cent. We had so much fun playing this. It was a back and forth well fought battle, that was just very enjoyable for us both. I'm looking forward to many, many more fun plays of this.

This game really deserves a reprint, but don't see that happening anytime soon. If you can afford it and have thought about getting this game. I'd highly recommend, that you do so now. FUN, FUN, FUN!!!!

Great game.  It's swingy and lucky but I love all the pieces and there certainly is strategy involved with getting to the end in one piece (or three, if you are the gungan/naboo side).  

The end game once particular battles are won does get a bit clunky, IMO, because it leads to a lot of unusable cards in hand.  But it doesn't detract much from the game.  It's still a lot of fun.

Very fun, especially if you're a Star Wars fan. Some say that it's a dice fest, but it eventualy balances out. And if you think that the Droids never hit anybody, tell that to Qui-Gon, Panaka, the Queen...

Yep, it uses the now loathed game mechanic of....DICE! Hand management is really the heart of the game, but yes...the afore mentioned now "archaic" dice mechanic can win the game. War should have some random wierdness, now if we could only devise a mechanic that emulates this....

Four battles all going on at the same time.  All battles affecting each other in some way.  Quick and easy to play.  Once, I saw the Control ship get destroyed, but the Bad Guys still won because Darth Maul had previously subjecated the Jedi and proceeded to defeat Amadala's forces.  Crazy stuff like this.  Great Ameri-trash.

The rating is almost entirely for the pieces: great Star Wars characters and pieces, and lots of action in this game.  You have to make a lot of decisions, and I suppose it is easy to figure out an ideal strategy, but it is fun to watch the battles unfold.

RATING: 8
Great concept and awesome components! It effectively translates the final battles of "Episode I" into a very atmospheric game. Anakin's battle to destroy the control ship is the weak point, though: the Trade Federation player has one or two obvious decisions, and the Naboo player has no decision at all. Also, it may cause the endgame to drag indefinitely if the Naboo player is winning but can't roll one of the right numbers. Apart from that, it's a very enjoyable game.

Very much like Heroscape crossbred with Commands and Colours. I prefer both of the latter games, though, because as a rule they are balanced and more flexible qua game systems. Queen's Gambit does cleverly integrate the many battles, though, and it does make Episode I look cool--which is no mean feat. Very impressive, and almost as good as two awesome games--definitely worth the setup time.

A lot of dice rolling and random card drawing. Should become boring after a few rounds. But it doesn't! This game is so well balanced that it stays exciting to the very end.

I like the way that (very clearly) you are dividing your time and effort into various different parts of what's going on in front of you. Yeah you can guarantee victory in one part, but you'll struggle in others. Balance and timing are key. Good game, wouldn't pay £100 for it though.

Themed out to the max. If the film had been this good we would be laughing. 
The game is a visual orgasm, with tense, yet simple, fun gameplay. Whoever wins the reactor core battle usually wins, but not always, and thats when this game rocks a fat one! The Daviau/Van Ness combo, kicks design arse once again. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
There is a reason this game is so highly sought-after and it goes beyond the hundreds of plastics minis. To be sure, there are few games with as much table appeal as this one. It's impossible not to be sucked into what is happening when you see it in action. But the real appeal here is a well-crafted game that clearly had a top-down design (i.e., theme first, mechanics flow out of that).

The main focus of the game takes place in the three-level palace, with guards rushing to get to the throne room either by the stairs or by grappling hooks through the windows. But several other mini-games are going on at the same time. Anakin needs to pilot his ship through the blockade to shut down the droids while the Trade Federation keeps putting more ships in his way. The Trade Federation also attempts to move its droids off the battlefield and into the palace while the Gungans try to stop them and kill them off. Meanwhile, an epic duel rages between Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and Darth Maul. The winner will rush into the palace and be a serious threat there. With so many things to manage, it could seem overwhelming, but the cards dictate what actions are available each turn. 

Each section of the game has a different feel. I love how the battle droids and palace guards are so plentiful and yet so weak. It creates this big battle with tons of carnage, as multiple figures die each turn. I love how Nute Gunray and Rune Haako literally just stand there and do nothing until they finally get surrounded and surrender. This game plays out the events of the movie so well that it actually makes the movie better. What other game can say that? This is a must have experience for any Star Wars fan, any Ameritrasher, any light wargame fan, and well, really anyone.

Based on one solo play... I can see why Ameritrash gamers love this one.

A card-driven wargame, with lots of dice-rolling, strategizing, fighting for advantages which may or may not pan out, plus one of the most popular sci-fi themes ever- it has so much going for it, and it's even a nice game to top all that off.

I enjoyed it- I forgot to go down and est breakfaat and let the coffee burn, I was having so much fun playing.

Great soft rubber/plastic pieces, good art.  The palace is a bit tipsy, and pieces went flying a couple times, but on the whole this one is a home-run.

After finally getting my hand's on a copy, the first play-through cemented the fact that I will never give up this gem, short of a $1 million offer. All of the battles, sans Anakin's journey, are extremely fun and work well with one another, providing a lot of strategery. Alas, this is Borg-like mechanics but you have a lot more choices and it's much more pleasing to the eyes. It is littered with miniatures that look amazingly detailed and are quite durable. The colors on select pieces are beginning to fade and I didn't get the mounds of extras like the original, but that's what I get for using eBay. It didn't detract at all as the theme alone made my buddy and I hum the Duel of the Fates score throughout.

In the first round as Darth Maul I mutilated Obi-Wan but lost to Qui-Gon, who single-handedly destroyed the rest of the palace so it led me to believe that once the duel or Trade Federation is finished, the game is essentially won/lost. No matter, I had a blast.

The only reasons for it not being a 10 are obvious:  the inevitable fiddly setup, Anakin's 'dice flight' and the fact that this is hard to find for a justifiable price. Trust me, it's worth every penny...but only if you can fork over a reasonable amount of clams!

Was not impressed with my one play. The only way for the good guys to win is for Anakin to do his thing. In my play I had cleaned out the throne room and had tons of troops left. I just sat around trying to advance Anakin. Boring. Every now and then my opponent would try to enter the room but my forces would crush him instantly.  It took ages for the final bit.

RATING: N/A
Four parallel battles played with a similar system to Battlecry.  The light sabre battle is largely beyond either player's control and the random result helps tip the balance in the palace battle.  The star fighter battle is very simple and once all the star fighter cards are used up the result is beyond the Empire's control and is a matter of time.  The palace battle is tricky and from the Empire's point of view it is a matter of rearranging forces and trying to take out the major enemy characters.  The battle on the plains is more straight forward and most like Battlecry (except that formation units get weaker as they take casualties).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Well this game is ok. It is cleverly designed and there is strategy, especially when it comes to choosing what cards to play and where to focus. Sadly this makes little difference as the game is a bit of an exercise in dice rolling. Believe me I don't mind dice, but it really seems like the decisions are almost inconsequential compared to getting good enough rolls to take out maul and blow up the ship with anakin.

edit: Looking through my comments I am struck with perhaps how unfair my comment is. The game is fine, but it just doesn't really interest me. Are the decisions as inconsequential as I might make out, probably not, but does this provide wonderfully immersive game play or really interesting game depth, not for me. In the end it is a decent enough game, but not something I really like or would ever choose to play. I also couldn't really recommend it unless perhaps you are a real starwars not, if so you may well like it.

Great game if you liked the movie, good game if you didn't.  As in the movie, the good guys and the bad guys fight it out over four separate, but linked, locations.  The system is similar to but an improvement upon the old WEG Assault on Hoth, with card draws determining who can do what and lots of dice determining the results of combat.  The components are all very nice.  The game takes a bit too long to set up and play, but it is enjoyable.  Three of the four battles work very well; only the Anakin battle design seems uninspired.  This part is essentially just a dice rolling contest, and if the dice heavily favor one side or the other in the Anakin battle, it will throw the entire game.

RATING: 3
A buddy of mine got this on ebay which was great because I'd been wanting to try it out for quite some time.  I love bits heavy games with strong themes, so this seemed to be right up my alley.  -But sadly, as much as I wanted to love this game, it left me feeling very let down.

First off, the Anakin track, while a neat idea, is entirely too long and too random.  This becomes unacceptable as it starts to make the game drag and can be very annoying.

Secondly, the Jedi battle is just a dice chunking match which, while lame, would have been OK except for that if a Jedi gets out into the palace, it's game over.  Unless Anakin makes a miraculous journey to the control ship, the winner of the Jedi battle is indeed the winner of the game.

So in short:
Components - Spectacular
Gameplay - Lame

Truly a shame...

I picked this up knowing it lacks strategy and is basically a dicefest because I do love Star Wars (though Episode I is not my fav) and it comes with all those great bits! I also like that the game takes place in 4 arenas simultaneously however the endgame conditions are silly and luck driven.  

The thing is, I have some great ideas for a redesign which I am inspired to do to hopefully fix most of these things. Will post it eventually once I work out the bugs and balance. If it turns out like I hope, this might actually become the grail game its made out to be...

[u]UPDATE:[/u] Yayyy I finally got to play after waiting about 8 years. I watched the good video review posted here first before buying and that leveled out my expectations after having them too high before from some hype.  

So yeah its a pretty light battle game, really light actually, but damn its cool with 4 simultaneous battles going on and probably the best components I've seen in a game besides maybe WOTR or especially the collector's edition. Must be the best Star War's game too though Assault on Hoth looks good, just no comparison component-wise.  

So its almost a roll and move game in reverse, kind of; basically you play a card, move, and then roll (to attack) and thats it really. This repeats over and over until the game ends. That sounds pretty bad, and it is where all 4 battles are determined the same way with a move roll resolution, BUT you do get to make some decisions with your cards, basically which ones to play and when which determines WHAT you attack with and WHERE which matters. 

The theme oozes huge in this game, it really plays like the movie for the most part and most important details were covered so its easy to see why some people love the game. This and the 4 simultaneous battles and the components definitely scored extra points for me (like a whole point, should be 6.5 really), but like many others I do wish there was more to it and if Anakin reaches the ship, which is completely luck based, the good guys win. I will think long and hard on this and see if I can come up with some alternatives or add-ons but after playing it won't be as easy as I first thought. 

The luck in the cards doesn't seem too bad as you get to hold 10 in your hand and you pick 4 of the 10 to play. The dice rolling, and there is alot of it, almost ever turn, is where the luck comes into play. Its laregly a war of attrition and a race at the same time where Anakin has to fight (roll) his way through to the ship and once he does, it pretty much should seal the victory unless all their forces have been killed. Seems to me that games should play in about 90 minutes which is nice and gameplay moves very fast with virtually no AP.

Definitely one of the best Star Wars games ever published and believe me because I've played most of them. Yes this is based on Episode One (the horror!) and there are a lot of Gungan's.  Regardless, this is a really great game and now out of print, surely never to be reprinted. Imagine managing four seperate battles at once; the attack on the palace, the battlefield, the space dogfights, and the Jedi battles. Ignore one battle and you'll surely suffer consequences, so the hardest part is knowing what to do and when to do it. You really feel as if you're taking part in the movie and the action is fast and furious. If you manage to find this game at an affordable price, get it. Don't think about it, buy it.

Love this game so much - it's use of Theme is fantastic, the components are top notch, the game plays well and fast. Bugbears are the ease of toppling the palace (USE THE FORCE!) and the dissapointing Jedi Battle which feels like it needs to be much cleverer.

A fairly simple game that recreates the conflict of Star Wars: Episode I with surprising accuracy.  Four different battlefields are portrayed and the card driven system makes sure that the results  are different in every game.

RATING: 6
A much-praised Ameritrash classic that commands laughably inflated prices on the secondary market. Given all the hype I was eager to track down someone who owns this so I could see what it's all about. 

The components are excellent, although I saw some board warping in the copy I played. As the good guys, you have to choose to fight with the Gungans on the plains of Naboo, use the Princess and Captain to infiltrate the Palace, or maneuver Anakin past the droid fighters to the control ship. Combat is straight up dice rolling. Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon seem a bit overmatched by Darth Maul's dice. 

I'd call this a great game to play with big Star Wars fans. As an execution of theme it gets huge marks, but as a game it's fairly pedestrian. I'm very pleased to have finally played it, but I can safely say that despite being out of print, it's nowhere near worth the going price.

This was such an unexpected treasure.  I got this quite a few years ago to play with my son who was at the time a massive Phantom Menace fan - I was older and wiser and knew the first films would never ever be bettered!  Anyway, I though a Star Wars game would go down well with him - and it did.  The real surprise was how well it went down with me!  Cards to drive the play?  Decisions to be made on which area to move?  Pieces to die for?  A multi-storey palace to fight through? It's magnificent.

operamang had highly recommended this to me a while back, based on my ratings and collection. Otherwise I likely wouldn't have tried this, so I'm really glad he did! An exciting tactical game that feels epic in scope. Components and boards out of this world (even a 3-floor 3D palace). I loved the 4 different sub-battles going on. So many memorable moments - I was the "bad guys," and at the end my Darth Maul destroyed the two jedis and started raging through the palace. But then Anakin swooped in an deactivated the droids, just a little too early for Darth Maul to finish wiping out the palace guards and the princess. I'm ready for the rematch though! 

I'm not into minis, and generally not all that into tactical games (Space Hulk just didn't do it for me). But, although I would jump at the opportunity to play this again. Dripping with theme and implements this into the mechanics in a very creative way that resonated with me.

This is a light, experience that game never becomes mindless or hands-off but never flirts with real depth either. Its sole claim to fame is the thematic integration, which is just mind-boggling given that the actual theme being integrated is about as terrible as it gets. Regardless, it's a pleasure to see how the theme is brought out in the game. 

Queen's Gambit requires lightning fast play to achieve even the slightest replayability, I think. It's got to be a ride to be worth it, and it's got to move fast. 

An interesting piece of board game history, but far from the grail game that some people make it out to be.

2 or 4 players.  The battle progresses on many fronts.  Armies of droids attack on Naboo.  Three jedi are fighting.  The queen and her entourage are trying to make their way into the castle.  Anakin is flying in to destroy something or other.

Very nice, cannot be left out of your boardgamecollection, especially Star Wars freaks (like me) will almost commit murder for a set. The gameplay is well balanced and either side can win. The carddriven systeem offers lot&#039;s of choices, the weakest battle in my opinion is Anakins flight which is almost impossible too fullfill. I organize Gamenights in my Pub in Capelle aan den IJssel (NL) and most of my customers really enjoy this one. Even so much that I started selling copies of them, since this and other games are hard to come by. I sell them whith little profit I&#039;am in it for the fun.

I am a sucker for 3-d games. This one looks so cool set up and it doesn't play bad either. Sure it's the same thing everytime. Play your cards on the jedi's first in the hopes of knocking the other jedi out of the game, try to get Anakin through the blockades as fast as possible and try to clear a few spaces on the battlefield in the hopes of getting a few bonus cards. But it's fun everytime, just slightly above Epic Duels for me.

The gungan field of play means nothing. If the queen gets to the top or if she dies, the game is over. Nothing else in the game matters unless Darth Maul can kill both Jedis (highly unlikely).

RATING: 7
An almost overwhelming boardgame: there's just so much to do. Players attempt to fight 4 different battles at once with each battle subtly affecting another. The game is cleverly designed to feel like a proper Star Wars game, with all the heroes and villains taking part.

Unfortunately some battles just weren't as exciting as the others. Anakin's space run for instance, just felt a bit tacked on. The components are fantastic, lots and lots of miniatures and a 3D palace board. And setup time was low because the designers thoughtfully placed set-up markers on the board. I found the 3D palace a bit fiddly but other than that, the components are great.

The game itself is an exciting experience. Rules can be a bit hard to grasp on your first play, but other than that, one of the best Star Wars boardgames I've played.

This game is Fun, Fast and Furious Action!  It has amazing "eye candy" appeal and the production quality is top-notch!  All the different colored miniatures are fantastic and the mechanisms all make sense for a purely fun, enjoyable strategy game.

(As a Star Wars fan, I liked episodes 4, 5 and 6 and Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress.)  Star Wars Episode 1 was a nice kid's story, and this game translates the story of Episode 1 extremely well, and it is one of the best designed "games converted from films".  

The 2-player version is ideal.  A nice clever 2p light game even though it is a little long but with experience it can be played in under 90 mins if you know how to speed things up by gaining Bonus cards.

RATING: 7
Rated high just because its pure fun with great theme!  Much like Epic Duels, just enhanced with four different battles going on at once and each must prioritize.  It is imperative for the good side to get young Anakin through the sky to the control ship ASAP and get into the throne room of the Trade Federation setting up a perimeter defense or history generally gets rewritten...:-)  The end game can get a bit boring if the right cards don't come up and all you are doing is cycling through useless cards.

A Christmas present from my Wife a few years ago now.  Played recently as a four player game, Me and my wife Trade Fed vs. 2 mates.  My mates once again had not listened to the victory conditions and were jumping up and down doing high fives when they had gained the upper hand on the third floor, when I said "not so fast" don't forget about Anakin!.  As a result Maul killed the two jedi and minced through the palace before Anakin could shut down the control ship and victory was mine (and my wifes).

Very good light wargame which integrates the five separate battles from the end of the Phantom Menace quite nicely.  Proof that a lot of thematically engaging chrome need not require an impossibly dense ruleset.  Don't let the fact that the movie itself was disappointing dissuade you from trying this game.  Incorporates tough decisions about how best to allocate resources (inspired by the emerging success of Eurogames at the time it was made) with classic Ameritrash attention to theme.  A host of different plastic miniatures fighting it out over a battleboard and three dimensional recreation of the Naboo adds to the appeal.

Daunting at first, but all four battles rattle merrily along and the point of them all quickly becomes clear.  The starfighter "clock" is rather amusing as a time-mechanism, but it is dependent on cards and a bad shuffle can leave you in trouble.  Otherwise, I found the battle systems elegant and quick, and the game as a whole quite well done and simple.

Fun and thematic. Gameplay is card driven and easy with dice to resolve combat. It is like 4 themed mini battles at once controlled by 4cards per turn (you don't have to do one of each). Pressing toward in one area and failings where this is balanced. Only have focused on the Jedi battle so far as when they get free from Jedi opposition the game is over.  In my case qui gon died and then obi wan rolled an unblocked 6 hit to take out darth maul. You could almost imagine the 2halves of him spiralling into the core .

RATING: 8.7
A beautiful, wonderful game. Visually stunning, of course, but also some nice gameplay that's a successful mash-up of programming and dudes-on-a-map. It has a great evolution from early to mid to late game that's driven by the players and the gamestate rather than any mechanisms. Keeping track of and balancing the four battlefields is fantastically thematic and brain-burny. I get to play with all my favorite characters-Qui-gon, Obi-wan, Padme-while my least favorites-Anakin and JarJar-are highly abstracted or missing entirely. At the end you have a great story of what could have happened at the end of Episode I.

RATING: 9
I really love this game for a bunch of reasons. First off, the theme ties to the wonderful Star Wars world quite nicely (duh!). Secondly, the production is good with very interesting bits. Thirdly, it plays in a very back and forth kind of manner most of the time - who has the upper hand swings crazily. And the best reason is that I get to play it with my kids and have a great time. A game where they beat me just about as often as I beat them.

The theme ties directly to Episode I. It has all the elements of the climactic scenes - jedi battle, palace battle, gungan/droid battle, and Anakin's trip into space.

The bits are nice little plastic minis that represent the multitudes of participants in the various battles. Some of the pieces represent single people, while others are parts of groups or units and then there is the Anakin spaceship marker too. The map is big and easy to use - though, care around the palace is always required. The biggest complaint about the game is the card size - a little small to shuffle easily - easy to bend cards.

The gameplay takes place in the four areas I have already specified. Each turn the players 'program' four actions and the order that they will occur - using the action cards. Each player has two decks and can concentrate effort based upon the actions they choose. There are battlefield and palace decks for each player. This is where the ebb and flow comes in. One player may concentrate on the battlefield while another focuses on the palace. And that will change throughout the game. And yes, there are lots of dice rolls too. But, like other dice-fest type games, the game isn't decided by one lucky or unlucky roll. If you plan or act poorly based on what is happening you will lose. I like the balance of luck and skill, though I know some will say the game has too much luck. But without it, I doubt my most important point would hold true...

And that is the game is really fun to play with kids. They can beat a seasoned gamer after a number of plays understanding some of the various strategies. I cannot look past the fact the kids generally like games with luck and lots of action. This game has strategy added to that mix.

So, the game has replayability, theme, good quality, and lots of fun. Is it the perfect game? Nope. But, that doesn't take away from the fact that is a fantastically fun one.

Although the game itself is probably only a six, with the right opponent and good table talk, this one is a lot more fun than you'd expect for something that's so luck-dependent.

With the multi-level palace and a ton of minis, plus all the Star Wars goodness, it has a definite cool factor. And despite the luck, there are still some choices to make and different strategies to try.

I've only played thrice--two of them at BGG.CON against Octavian (I kicked his butt the first time, he returned the favor the following year.)

This has a very high "Wow!" factor when set up. It would be nice if the construction was a little more stable, but so it goes.

This also is one of those games that overcomes a very high luck factor by creating an effective illusion of having tons of choices. Luck of the draw will play strongly into the outcome--but you do have to make sensible choices with whatever cards you have on hand at any given time.

Star Wars geeks who love great bits and don't mind dice and luck will absolutely go gaga over this, and rightly so. It's a little long to call it a beer 'n' pretzels game, but it's got that feel. I wouldn't want to play this every week (or even every month, I suspect), but I'd be happy to bust this out a couple times a year and have a great time with it.

All things considered, I think I'm willing to call this a 7 (okay, an 8). But do not, I repeat do not, shell out the absurd price this goes for if you're not okay with the idea of a relatively long, dice-heavy, luck-filled game. You'll be disappointed, not to mention substantially lighter in the wallet, if you fail to heed this advice.

First impressions - great game. I wonder if M44 wasn't inspired by this? Mechanics are awesome, and tie-in perfectly with theme. However I wonder if the battlefield is even worth fighting for? It takes an action (possibly more) to eliminate a group... and all you get out of it is an extra bonus action? Basically you're trading a known action now for an unknown action later... I don't quite see the point there. Looking forward to testing my theory out.

Update: upped my rating to 9. This game is awesome -- I wish it played faster so I could bring it to the table more often! I have the feeling that this will take over Blood Bowl as my favourite 2-player game. The battlefront cards ARE less useful than the palace cards, at least those that only activate one unit. But when you can pretty much guarantee a kill (ex: a battlefield card that activates two DDs), it can be a good play to guarantee an bonus palace card for next round. Towards the end of the game those AATs are just brutal!

Update 3: Well, I don't see this game going to a '10' anymore. The fixed setup/strategy is a bit of a downer. Don't get me wrong -- the game is AWESOME, but I wouldn't see myself playing more than once a month because each game is going to be fairly similar to each other one.

I really like this game. Even though Anakin and the Jedi's really determine the outcome of the game, you can not ignore the palace or the battle field. Forgetting to get the bonus cards from the battle field can really come back to haunt you.

This is a fun, well made game.  It apparently uses a system similar to "battle cry" (a game I've not played) and it is really very well balanced.  It's a bit of a dice fest, but this should randomize-out after a while, as both sides roll heaps.  The strategy comes in when deciding where to play your moves (you have a hand of cards that allow you actions in several distinct areas, you must decide where to focus your efforts).  Really nice components (plastic soldiers!  You can play with 'em after you finish a game!).  All in all a good little game.

RATING: 7.75
Card-driven dicey wargame with LOADS of theme.  It adds a new dimension of conducting multiple conflicts (throne room, plains of Naboo, reactor core, driod control ship) simultaneously - distinguishing it from similar games (Battlelore, Battle Cry, etc.).  When we sat down to play this, we were ripe with anticipation, and we had lots of fun through the first two-thirds of the game.  After a while, the balance waned and it got one-dimensional and slow.  Major problems were the inability of the Federation player to move meaningful amounts of droids into the palace before they were haplessly cut down by the highly mobile Jedi, which used the stairs as the choke points.  Once Naboo was devoid of Gungans, the droids became useless in the game.  All the starfighter cards had been played, and we had to cycle through the decks 1.5 times before Anakin finally got the dice rolls he needed to put the Federation out of its misery by deactivating the droid control.  The bits, theme and creative element of the "war on many fronts" (which simulates the first movie quite well) gives this game an inflated rating.  After a second play, I am convinced whomever gets their Jedi into the palace (i.e. wins the Generator Core battle) will win the game; the combat disparity created seems a significant obstacle to overcome.

Played several games now.  The problem of things toppling over in the palace remains a nuiance.  Otherwise, the game remains very enjoyable.

Queens Gambit has got to be one of the best Star Wars games ever made.

Ameritrash Star Wars heaven with over 150 miniatures battling out the last 45 minutes of Episode I, its a light weight dicey war miniatures game with simple rules and no worry about money sink death from expansions.

It plays very well (if unpredictably), and its great fun watching an army of droids blast up Gungans.

Evil 5-1 Good so far, but I'm sure that's not how its supposed to be!

The force is strong with this one.

This is the best thing about the first Star Wars prequel film to be produced! The pieces are tremendous and there is no denying that thr 3D palace looks fantastic.
The gameplay is simple, which in this case is not a bad thing, as you need to follow the action (of which there is plenty) in four different areas simultaneously.
Deep in thematic goodness, I can't wait to play this again!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Mmm...Memoir '44 style card play meets the Star Wars universe in a grail game.

This really is very high quality from Avalon Hill/Hasbro from the components to the gameplay. Each side endeavours to manage 4 different locations, from the Naboo Palace to the fields of Naboo to the lightsaber duel with Darth Maul to the Anakin space mission.

The game is card driven and each unit has its own movement, attack and defence stats much like Axis and Allies (even the summary tiles are reminiscent of the original A&A).

Hand management is key but the game can swing quickly too based on dice rolls and strategic decisions.

Easily the best thing to come out of The Phantom Menace and Hasbro in a long time.

RATING: 8
The theme of this game is a 10, and any "serious" Star Wars fan should own it.  Since I'm more of a casual Star Wars fan, I find this game devolves into a dice fest that runs too long.  I still give it an 8, because I had fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
It's full of flavor following very closely the movie with very simple rules. The fun factor was high.
My only concern is about the replayability since the game is based on one "scenario" and I am afraid that it may get old after 3 of 4 times.

RATING: 8
If only the movie were like this game: filled with tension, character, and tough decisions.  Like a good Euro game, there are more things you want to do than you can do in Queen's Gambit.  You have to manage four separate and unique battles, each with their own importance to the overall game.  But the game also has a very strong theme and a good, visceral feel.  I love that it is asymmetrical, and that it uses cards for its primary action selection, both of which are mechanics I really like.

While the overall production is great, I would have liked cards that are easier to sleeve, and the three story palace, while cool, is a recipe for toppled pieces.  Otherwise, this is a great game, and if you can get your hands on a copy or play someone else's, I highly recommend it.  As long as the dice rolling and confrontation don't put you off, this game is for you.

RATING: 6.5
A fun strategic game where there are 4 simultaneous battles (Jedi battles, Anakin, palace and battlefield) going on and one plays cards to influence the outcome. Lots of dice rolling, and one cannot get too emotionally attached to any one roll, but has to hope that on average, the luck should balance out. Decisions must be made to decide which battle should be influenced. Lots of plastic figures and great maps. Some thinking involved, but dice take over after that. Okay to play, though it takes at least two hours, not including set up time. Good to bring out every now and then, when there are two players. Almost a 7 out of 10. Most of my games have been tense, but I have played one game where the Naboo player overran the trade federation by running Anakin and there was nothing the Trade Federation could do.

RATING: 6.5
Smart looking components and good fun, but the Jedi duel is rubbish.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Surprizing how well this game actually simulates the movie.  Very well in fact.  The gungans get the crap knocked out of them in the battle field.  The palace is hotly contested, but only because of the sneakiness of the palance guard being able to window jump (just like in the movie), and the Jedi and Sith are just too cool (and very powerful, as they should be).  The game is very simple.  It involves some coordination of attacks and strategy, but really it comes down to getting the cards you need, when you need them and rolling well.  Still, a classic piece of ameritrash, and if you are a Star Wars fan, you will love it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun and tense.  Lots of eye candy.  I wish there were more to the jedi battle but everything else plays with a great feel to it.

--update--
Still a solid 8.  Lots of ways for games to end, which keep things exciting.  Better yet, my fiancee has beaten me twice in a row (both as the badguys) so she's more than happy to keep this coming to the table.

Thematic game that captures well the events of Episode one. Game has light card-driven mechanic. It looks very pretty with lots of miniatures. Game is asymmetrical for two sides but it is balanced enough so either side has about even changes to win.

Playing this has dampened my enthusiasm to track down a copy (although the price is much more of a factor!). That's not to say it's not a good game: a slick, simple, dice-driven combat, and it's had about all it can done with it. But there aren't really enough significant decisions, and the Anakin segment - like the equivalent bit in the film - is a bitter disappointment.

Enjoyed this one, although it is not for everyone due to the heavy theme, and significant number of pieces. Ending can seem like pure chance. Game is a great play with a mixed group of friends, perhaps 2-3 times. Worth trying. UPDATE: As interest in Star Wars fluctuates, my desire to play this follows course. 3/06: Played in January, lost. Was fun, but it was annoying having the pieces tumble out of the palace when it was bumped. Discovered I was playing a rule wrong: too late. Was beat by my 9-year old nephew.

Will the Jedi succeed in destroying Darth Maul?  Can the Gungans survive the droid onslaught?  Play cards and roll dice to find out.

I tend to shy away from any 'Star Wars' game as they usually are intended for kids. This is a real game, with real strategic decisions required. It employs a card system similar to Battle Cry or Mem44 but actually improves on these games with the multiple boards. It is amazing that play on one board can have such affect on another. The player is confronted with the possibility that too much progress on one board will retard progress on another. Easy game system to learn but very tough to master.

I'm giving it a 6, with the hopes that I can increase it in the future.  It certainly has a lot of cool pieces, and it has the Star Wars "feel" to it.  Indeed, it's probably one of the better Star Wars games I've played.  BUT, there's a lot to this game that I haven't grasped yet.  The plains of Naboo, for example, don't see much play at all.  And the Jedi battle...seems so static. They just trade blows...no moving at all for the most part.  Anakin's journey, which is REQUIRED for victory, is based on the rolls of two six-sided die (Well, it's not required, you can kill ALL of the droids, but that seems unlikely).  I want to play it some more, and I hope that some of the more subtle aspects of the game come to light.

Sure it's just a complete dicefest, but it definitely is fun.  The best part of this game is the fact that there can be wild swings of luck / advantage.  Even though it looks like the game may be in the bag for one side, fortunes can sometimes change, and drastically.  I've seen games come down to a dice roll on one side for the win, and then pass the turn for a roll to the other side for the win - talk about balance.  Light and fun way to spend an hour, especially if you like the Star Wars universe at all.

04-10-2014. Update after second game. Still a very fun game! This time I won although I completely got wiped in the plains battle. It became kind of close though in the end. I am contemplating a house-rule, given that the plains battle was over (ie. all my gungans dead) before the game was won, to battlelore the system a little and allow you to play a battlefield card as a random action for just 1 unit. Increased from 7.5 to 8.

19-08-2014. Rated after first game. Fun game. Need to think more about valid strategies and more time/games to properly rate it. I am a bit afraid for massive walk-overs for whomever wins the plains battle.

Satisfyingly varied but simple enough to pick up quickly.  The random nature of the Annakin component does detract--but heck, even Craps (as in the table game...) can be fun!  High quality components, and the the multiple boards is fun.  Also like the dispatching of actions on turns, and the way that the fairly obscure "Die Tables" that older combat/adventure games generally had in common is replaced by dedicated die sets (though something other than D6 would have been better--these larger six sided ones are hard to roll well).  Very replayable but not for mini fanatics, or those who abhor the factor of chance.  Good for younger gamers looking for something a bit more involving--particualrly good for father/son activity where there is a common Sci-Fi (or particularly Star Wars cannon) pre-disposition.

What a wonderful adaptation of the final moments of the movie!  And it's a great game to boot.

Every time I play this game, I start to grown as l uck seems to go against me (at least in my biased perception).  Of course, this happens in any game in which actions and/or their success is at least controlled randomly (either by cards or dice).  I often find this to be a frustrating exercise.  However, in this game, it all seems to work.  I'm not convinced that it is the best designed or best balanced of games, but it sure is a lot of fun.  And for me, at least, captures the feel of the Star Wars universe.  Really, what more do you need. [01/18/2009]

160  miniatures. Star Wars. Not epic duels. 

4 battles occuring on a LARGE board. Wait, on 3 seperate boards. The tri-level palace is very attractive albeit unstable. 

The card driven system cleverly replicates the events of Episode 1 and forces players to innovate as they battle on different fronts.

The good guys should focus on moving Anakin's starfighter and kill off Darth Maul. Bad rolls can lose you the game.

The bad guys should kill off the Jedis and flood the palace with droids. Once Darth Maul is free in the palace, goodbye queen, panaka and palace guards.

The bonus cards are very useful. In addition to extra actions, they help you trim the deck and get the cards you REALLY need/want (eg: Anakin's starfighter card near game end).

Loads of flavour and tension.

RATING: 7
initial thoughts:
 
- this succeeds in being a lite combination of different games: 1) War of the Ring (also a combination of different game mechanics, excellent theme implementation, & general short-attention-span delight), 2) Commands & Colors (card-driven unit-activation, & 3) Heroscape (combat resolution)

- pleasantly, for the first 2 above, it does this w/out the drawbacks of 1) WotR's excessive minutiae & 2) C&C's theme-breaking left-center-right activation.

- now, the not-so-great parts: 

a) playing is a significant 3-4 hr investment, which seems at-odds to the game's light weight. if a game is going to take that long, i need more of a brain-burn.

b) the streamlined combat resolution is too abstract; ie, there's no opportunity fire or defensive fire; imagine Jar-Jar in the middle of a battle walking right up to a deadly destroyer droid to blast it in the face at point blank range. yeah, that happens here.  

ultimately, this game excels at theme-implementation. while Phantom Menace leaves a bitter taste, Lucas' greatest gift is his ability to portray epic, multi-front battles in a coherent and engaging narrative. 

this game achieves that too. it recreates that signature Lucas visual of switching from scene to scene as the battle rages, weaving the events into a memorable story.

It is a fun romp of a game.  That said there are serious problems with it.  It would probably get an 8 if the value of each section was equal to the joy of playing it. The part that is most interesting for me is the Gungans' battle (yay, you get to feel good about being the bad guys) and the race up the tower is fun, but that is determined by who wins the Jedi Battle or by Anakin's flight.  I wish something more to the Jedis and the space race, but instead of playing the fun part of the game, you have to focus on the static luckfests.  I do really like the card system, this was well executed and the decisions were engaging.  I see how people can love this, it tells a great story (certainly better than the movie does) and puts you in the action, but it just feels patched up on the edges.  Where is Fantasy Flight to fix this with an expansion!

I have to thank ATTICUS for hooking me up with a play on this bad boy.  Such a creative system invented for this one, that truly mimics the great end of Episode 1.  The mechanics are spot on and really make this feel like a unique, epic game, which is exactly the way it should feel.

If you enjoy Battle Cry, you&#039;ll almost certainly like this one too, and I&#039;m not a Star Wars devotee. Both games give players a hand of cards to move their armies, use line of sight, distance requirements, and special dice for conflicts.  They also both feature attractive components and a visually appealing board, especially Queen&#039;s Gambit.  Hint: focus on the overall game objective (don&#039;t worry about losing the battle, just make sure to win the war).

This game was unique in it's game mechanics with the four simultaneous battles.  Games tend to be very tense and exciting affairs.  The downsides for me are the rickety building and the long set up time.  But it is a solid game and one I am proud to own.

There is a potential for luck to determine the outcome in SW:QG, but the game is a lot of fun to play and a good player will win more often than not.

RATING: 7
Hard to track down a copy but worth it, particularly if you are a fan of the Star Wars universe.  The game features 4 simultaneous battles that you have to manage via card plays.  The Gungan battlefield is purely a source of bonus cards, which means the most important arenas for both players are the space battle and Theed Palace.  As an AT fan I love all the chrome this game has, but it definitely has strategy in there as well.  The only complaint I have is the game seems too imbalanced against the Naboo player.  Given the Naboo goal of eliminating all droids, it seems that the entire game rests on getting Anakin to the trade federation command ship because there is NO way you can wipe out all droids via conventional combat with Gungans and palace guards.  I think the game would be better if you actually had a chance to wipe out the droids via combat.  Then you would have to really ponder what strategy to use; try to get them all in one strike using Anakin or take your chances with combat.  I think some kind of tweak is necessary to make this game really great instead of just good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Incredible components in a nice card(luck)-driven game about Star Wars. Maybe it's too long and too difficult for Naboo player to win but it's a must have for me. How is possible to win if Anakin does NOT manage to make the right numbers????  By now: Trade Federation 3 - Naboo 2

The board itself is so very cool.  The palace set-up is fantastic and the minis while not the greatest, are cool to see.  I liked every mechanism that was incorporated into the game, and it all made sense, so thematically it was close to flawless.  I can see how the amount of dice rolling could annoy some, but we had no problem with it.  Very excited to I was able to play this game at Dice Tower Con 2016.

Update:  Super excited to own it!  Star Wars Rebellion takes many of the aspects and improves upon them, but this game still ranks very highly in my eyes and i'm excited to play it for years to come!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Based on only one game so far.  The early play was quite fun, but it seemed to take a bit long.  We basically got into a situation where it was absolutely clear the Naboo forces were going to win (killed Maul with both Jedi still alive, and managed to wipe out the palace droids).  I couldn't bring in reinforcements in enough quantity to stand even a chance against the Jedi.  However, Anakin hadn't made it past square one, so we had a really really long stretch that was basically just me making a few desperate and futile shots while the Naboo player played all the Anakin cards she could to try to get the game over with.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The Queen's Gambit is the very definition of Ameritrash.  It drips with theme, has a lot of luck and even more plastic pieces, and it's completely immersive.  The way things are woven together really ties the theme into the gameplay.  I love the 3 story palace board despite that fact that it makes it a bitch to move guys.

There's a reason this is so expensive.  It's a modern classic that provides an awesome experience.  I am a lucky man to own a copy.

The Game looks superb.  Ameritrash at it's finest.  Best application of theme to its source material I've ever seen in a boardgame, accurately capturing the final scene in the Phantom Menace. Whilst the movie is a flop this game is anything but.  Tense, fun, some compelling decisions, not too deep, luck is managed to some extent by the sheer volume of dice rolls in the game. And all those game bits.  And did I mention the 3D game board? Whoooop!

I really liked this game and some of the decisions that it gives you.  I'm glad I found it when I did. 

There is some luck in all the dice rolls and all, but there is also much in the way of strategy, a little bit of forward planning. etc. 

I think the Jedi Battle is probably the most important thing to take care of at first, but balancing the battles to some degree is important and should not be ignored.

RATING: 7.5
Very fun and thematic recreation of the four simultaneous battle zones at the end of The Phantom Menace.  I throw the movie on for background noise to enhance the experience (first time that movie has enhanced anything...).  

It reminds me of playing War of the Ring -- both in terms of the strong implementation of theme and the need to balance numerous playing fields -- but with the benefit of much less overhead.  I do prefer WotR, in part because luck isn't as big a factor and in part because the theme is so much richer, but Queen's Gambit will be much easier to get on the table.

I'm very happy I was able to get a hold of what was my ultimate grail game.  If someone made a Return of the Jedi version of this, it would be my favourite game, period.  (Update: Turns out that's not necessarily true, since the later released [i]Risk: Star Wars Edition[/i] is not as good.)

Truely amazing 2-player-game (the variant for 4 players is lame) considering how it creates an epic feeling. If only the movie had been this good. You fight on several (four) fronts. If you neglect one of your tasks, your enemy will stomp you, so you have to find the right balance. Luck has its part in dice-throwing, but that's for both sides. Gets + 1.0 in the overall rating for the stunning art work and components. I haven't been this enthusiastic about a game in a long time. When playing this again, I think, I'll try playing it more according to the movies, in particular the showdown between Darth Maul vs. Obi-Wan/Qui-Gon. The red walls really should be barriers and Obi-Wan only permitted to access the fight once Qui-Gon is defeated. That is, if he is defeated. Otherwise it seems impossible for Darth Maul to emerge victorious in that battle and once he is taken care of, the light side just sweeps through to an unrivaled win.  

Update: This game is even better with the few tweaks

This game was great fun!  I'd love to get a copy of it if it were reasonably priced, but I can't see myself spending the exorbitant amounts that it goes for these days.  It took the system of the Commands & Color's games and made it compelling with a great theme.  Too bad the game could have been even better if they'd changed it to the Battle of Hoth from Episode V.  It would fit perfectly, just change Anakin to the carriers getting away, the battle in the field to a snow field with speeders and Imperial walkers, and Darth Maul to Darth Vader.  Either way, I enjoyed Queen's Gambit, and would love to play it again.

Played once so far.  While I really wanted to like this one it seems unbalanced.  On the battlefield, the TF (Trade Federation) have to move droids into the shields, only to be wiped out by the Gungan catapults.  Thier only hope is to quickly kill a Fumbaa and bring down the shields so that their vehicles can join the fight.  The jedi fight is simply a dicefest with Darth Maul having 16 hit points and the 2 jedi having a combined total of 22 so it averages out that Darth will lose the fight and hopefully take out a jedi with him, leaving the other jedi to mop up what's left in the palace.  Inside the palace the Naboo side has 3 characters that also have multiple hit points along with their guards which cancel out the TF's side droids.  It seems like whoever wins the jedi fight, wins the game.  House rules maybe?  hmm...

It started as a game I enjoyed because my son liked it so much. Then I found that I wanted to play it myself. It is the most immersive game (that I have played) in my collection. Keeping an eye on the 4 different arenas at the same time is exciting. This game never fails to deliver entertainment. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Based on the four battles at the end of Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace -- the battle on the plain between the Gungan forces and the droid army; the attempt by Naboo forces, led by Queen Amidala, to storm the palace and capture the Trade Federation viceroys; the fight between Darth Maul and the two Jedi Knights; and the space battle in which Anakin's starfighter destroyed the Droid Control Ship.
The forces are represented by 155 plastic miniatures on three separate boards, including a three-level palace. The action is driven by two decks of cards for each side. Each turn, each side simultaneously chooses four action cards from a hand of ten, and places them in order. The actions are then carried out one at a time, alternating sides. Combat is resolved using special attack and defense dice.

This is a LONG game --- one session could easily take 3 hours to play. But strangely enough this duration suits this 2-player game very well: There is little downtime and the suspense is building up very well. Even though there is A LOT of dice rolling in the game, there is so much of it you have the feeling it evens out over the course of the game. I am not too fond of the components of this game (rubbery plastics), but when set up the game looks pretty impressive. Just cannot get over the fact that the game feels so balanced and the rules are so tight. Rare for this kind of game IMHO.

I really, really hate to talk this out of print game up when so many other people have already done so, but it's simply fantastic.  It's a shame that this is tied so closely to both Hasbro and to the Star Wars franchise as to make the chance of a straight-up reprint so unlikely.  This is a remarkable adaptation of the final fight of the movie.  Like the fight in the movie, it's a spectacle.  In the game's case, the bits are fantastic, especially the three level palace and Anakin's ship.  The gameplay is wonderful too, a blend of old familiar mechanics from all kinds of different games, including Battle Cry, and even old dungeoncrawlers like HeroQuest.  Add me to the legions clamoring for a reprint, or at least a redevelopment of this game.

 Juggles four battlegrounds with simple efficency,amazingly there are hardly any rules at all,yet each battle has its own distinct flavour. Every game i have played has been close fought,the game seems to be very well balanced,even though a lot of luck resides in the dice.
 The 3D element of the board is a flimsy card structure which is supposed to stand in the middle of the table;this gets in the way of players passing dice between themselves and obstucts view to your opponents card play to a degree,but really this is a minor quibble.
 The Queens Gambit is a thing of beauty. Not sure if it is worth £150+ though...Sheesh.

The perfect board game following all major events from the moving and tying them nicely together into an engaging game.  I only wish the battle in the reactor room was better thought out as it seems to use more board space than needed.

Really good components, lot of stuff you can adapt to play with SW characters.

This game is easy to play and learn while do some very complicated things.  You are fighting the ground battle on Naboo, moving Anakin to destroy the control ship, fighting Jedi and Sith and trying to gain control of the palace.  And yet it is all tied together.  It is not my favorite game ever, but I am glad it is a part of my collection.

This game really does not work as a four player game.

Very fun miniature war game. Lost of gorgeous miniatures resulting in a high toy factor (which isn't a bad thing ;) for this game). Ok, this is a die fest, but I have the impression that managing the four different battles helps to balance things out, without adding too much complexity.

Some cool board game store in Canada found a stash of games in their warehouse years ago. I managed to see the post on BGG in time and buy a copy for around $85 before they sold out.

My holy grail game.  I may possibly wet myself if I ever obtain a copy of this game.  Have played it a few times and want nothing more than to play it again and again.

This game is a lot of fun.  I had my doubts, but bought it anyway for the theme and all the bits and all the different playing areas.  I knew that Star Wars games tend to be so-so at best, so I didn't expect to enjoy the actual game a lot.

I was greatly mistaken.  There's a lot of cool bits, a lot of different types of gaming going on, and you have to decide when and where to attack and defend across several fronts.

It's been awhile since I've played it, but in the past I played it quite a bit and had a lot of fun varying strategies.  I highly recommend it.

Lots and lots of plastic. Looks great on the table. Not a bad game but is too long for what it is I feel.

Nifty game, with great bits, that does a pretty good job of tieing the four battles together. Darth Maul is pretty much screwed, and the Anakin track is pretty bogus. Still, pretty good fun.

Excellent components and a fun game from the Star Wars universe. It captures the climatic and chaotic battle from the movie wonderfully.  What more could one ask for?

game based largely on luck. also rather too long for my liking (usually over 3 hours). nice pieces though.
Ratings have gone up considerably since my great game had 15 Jan 2004. see session report for details. Also, luck is mitigated by hand management, resulting in a very close match. This game is definitely worth keeping.

A lot going on. A card driven wargame with 3 battle areas. Very nice minatures.

First play set up and play took about 140 minutes.

What a fun game!  It's not deep, but it does a really nice job of evoking the feel of the movie.  In our first game, things were looking quite grim for the Naboo with the shield falling and the heavy tanks moving in, the queen and Captain Panaka pinned down and surrounded by battle droids, when Anakin managed to get through the last barrage of starfighters to destroy the droid control ship just as an enraged Obi-Wan defeated Darth Maul to avenge his fallen master, Qui-Gon.  Yep, that's the movie.  Pretty cool.

This must be one of the best implementations of theme in a game ever.  The game plays out with the feel and events of the movie, but with the possibility of an alternate ending that is not only believable but quite fun to play out.  Darth Maul taking care of business with both of the Jedi and then cleaning out the palace single handedly, sorry Mike.  That damn shaky palace is a bit of a headache but still can't topple this game from being a 10.

Lots of miniatures and the multiple fronts means you really can't get totally shut down by your opponent.

The best SW game? I think so. A thing of beauty when it's all set up. Good enough to make you realize the climax of Ep. I was tighter than you remember. Flows smoothly, with little to no rule problems; excellent and concise rule book; Game can get stalled on occasion (Naboo player captures palace while Trade Fed player captures battlefield turns into a bit of a waiting game) but almost ALL games seem to come down to just the last second. Worth seeking out.

I love the ridiculous number of figs in this one.  Quite a variety of game types packed in here.  Overall it's enjoyable (more so than the crappy movie it's based on) but it runs way too long.

RATING: 7.5
Now I get why this is considered a grail game among many people.  The frantic nature of war, of having to spread your actions between three different battles being fought at the same time, is both thrilling and exhausting.  Granted since the most assured win for the good side is to get Anakin to the palace as fast as possible, you cannot ignore the other parts because of the card advantage they give each time an enemy unit is eliminated.

Sure it's a dice fest through and through, and the gameplay is fairly straightforward, but if you like Star Wars, I think there are plenty of action to be had here and well worth the investment.  Especially considering how well produced it is.  One of the best 2-player games in my opinion.

RATING: 9
The rating it's for the system (GCACW). I have played "Stonewall in the Valley" during 2010-2011 and in my oppinion this is the best operational system of the American Civil War.
The Series have simple mechanics and very unpredictable activations-movement which creates great tension during the playing.
Very solo friendly.
Too bad that I/We does not have the space to mount the magnificent maps and the time to play it more often.

Absolutely fantastic. I have only recently discovered the GCACW series and I have been completely  swallowed into it. The maps are gorgeous, and the whole series is a wonderful portrayal of almost the entire civil war. The basic rules are moderately easy to master after a few games. The advanced rules make the game a serious strategical war-game which requires thinking and planning. The scenarios introduce the player wonderfully into the game. Personally I believe that it should be played by every serious war gamer. An absolute must!

I gave this a high reating because it is my favorite of the series.  The entire GCACW series is a high quality system, but I enjoy this one most of all due to the "what if" possibilities of the Union stiking at Lee before he pulls together his scattered army.  I must say that playing that scenario has given me some the most tense (and frustrating) moments in my gaming life.

Players take on the roll of Lee and McClellan during the American Civil War, specifically the Antietam period of 1862.  Great follow up to the Stonewall Jackson's Way, the first in the excellent Great Campaigns of the American Civil War series.  This is a stunning series of games, featuring low counter density (division) scaled on a 1 mile hexsides.  Units are moved via die roll, neatly simulating the frustration commanders encountered trying to get their troops into place.  The maps are beautiful and meticulously researched.  Excellent, intuitive rulebook, with a wonderful gazetteer of locations included.  And the series only got better from here.

This was my first GCACW game, and it is a good one.  I previously owned all games of this series, but after playing them all many times, I got burned out and sold them on ebay.  In my opinion (Avalon Hill - the previous name) the weakest link in this game, as well as all games in this series, is the counters.  The quality is poor.  They're made out of cheap cardboard, and some of the counters are off-centered.  They have a dull finish.  In an effort to make them a little better, owners will have to clip the dog ears off and use a fingernail file to smooth out the sides.  Even this did little to improve the appearance.  Despite this, I would recommend this game, and others in the series.

Great game and great series.  Not overly complex but enough so that it's not for beginners, and just a bit of chrome.  It hits my sweet spot for complexity.  The initiative system is a great way to mix things up and raise and destroy your hopes and plans every turn.  Every game is completely different from the previous one and keeps the game fresh.

Outstanding operational game on ACW. Probably the definitive ACW operational series; easy to play, good "color", initiative based system (die roll+leadership determines which leader goes next). I never really liked the combat system that much (which is the only reason this gets a 9 instead of a 10), but every other component of the design is so great, that the game is a blast to play.

Other games in the Great Battles of the ACW series are also gems. Well supported (a couple of players guides) and fanatically played at WBC each summer - and always an online tourney going on.

Great series with great production values!! It is about simulating all the campaigns of the American Civil War (ACW) at operational level. The series has a beautiful and natural flowing game system with the right balance between playability and realism. The rulebook is so informative and well written that every game mechanics is so logically explained that you hardly have to memorise them. The rulebook alone worth the whole game price. A day by day historical account and insightful analysis of the campaign with hex numbers of the key battle location and cities/ towns is included. Not even to mention the extraordinary historical game maps, useful summary of tables in the player aid cards, portrait of every major leaders participating in the campaign, lots of scenarios etc. Key features include: variable movement of battle force, leader initiatives, morale, force march, train movement, breastworks and fortifications, hidden force strength, logging of ammunition level, flank attack, supply and foraging, etc. Plus, all the game maps in the series can be joined to recreate virtually the entire conflict in the eastern theatre!! The best game series about the ACW so far in the history of wargame. Hats off to the veteran wargame designer Joseph Bolkoski!!

I had been thinking about this for a while as an operational game on the campaign which led to Antietam, to accompany None But Heroes.  Second hand copies come up every so often in the US, but with shipping this was going to come to US$60 or more.  At Cancon 2015, I guy turned up selling his old games.  This is a pretty beaten up copy, and is missing a few generic counters (strength markers of a few different values), but it was cheap and allows me to see the broader picture beyond the Antietam battlefield.  I have played the campaign solo and it is an interesting situation in the aftermath of Second Manassas.

Very playable operations level game of the American Civil War.  Here Come the Rebels focuses on the campaign in the East before Gettysburg, including Antietam.  Each turn you activate the units in random order by rolling initiative - highest player moves a unit - until nobody wants to move anymore.  Units acquire fatigue and become ineffective and they may not be in the right place when you need them.  The campaign itself is very exciting with a lot at stake.  Counters are so-so, maps are beautiful, and the rules are quite readable.  A good game, overall, but not my favorite in the series.  See Grant Takes Command!

Probably destined to become my favorite of the GCACW games, given  the strong local interest (I live in hex E1428). Have played some of the scenarios, but not either of the campaigns. Suffers as do all the games in the series from a complete lack of fog of war, though Pat Hirtle's variant published in the General (and Skirmisher #1) goes a long way towards remedying that. Flanking operations are too easy to pull off, and it's rare for the armies to butt heads in the kind of slugfests you saw historically. But this is good, good stuff.

Good example of this wonderful system. I am not clever enough at this game to think the Confederates are favoured. I have made the Union look respectable too. Nice geography in this one. Beautiful map, as always. Just a great game, work of art. Very immersive "narrative" produced with each play. Highly recommended.

RATING: 8.5
Very good game. Some fiddly bits, but overall, the game system works very well. Decent, if uninspired counters, with beautiful maps and good player aids. (See my review.) The more I play this series of games, the less I like the heavily scripted/restrictive rules of "entry" at the beginning of the campaign scenarios. More flexibility would make the games more interesting. I guess I prefer games that are more "gamey" than simulations.

The GCACW series is the best operational games on the Civil War. 
The alternating nature of individual movements allows for concentrations and reaction to the concentration. The system plays pretty cleanly. 

The Sharpsburg campaign plays well with a lot of options for both players. The confederate objectives are spread out forcing the historical dispersal of forces. Can the union which is concentrated force a battle before the confederates consolidate?

RATING: 10
Just One of the best system ever designed. An improvement from the very first release of Lee Vs. Grant. Compoments quality are superb and no matter which tittle you get because all of them are full of joy. The only one drawback is cost. Actually most of the game series are out of print and new titles are on the $80-$90 range, but every cent you invest is a worth.

GCACW is a tremendous operational system featuring flat-out beautiful map sheets. If I have any complaint about it at all, it's that the simulation of large battles suffers a little due to the one-day time scale. Still, there's nothing like it for reliving Lee's invasions of the north.

Yay, Now for sale for the record 65 bucks original like new complete & unpunched. Small diamond. This Civil war series is without a doubt the best ever made. GBACW doesn't come close, but they have some damn fine games!  Great Campaigns of the Civil War is the best Civil war  Stuff ever. There is an opportunity here, as the Rebels come! Even a cool one turn South Mountain scenario. This is where I begin. I've given it a lot of thought and decided a bloody battle as most were but this has some excellent learning scenarios. I'm so glad I invested in this much fun and took this route. I'm lucky in that I have a Civil War History buff to make it much more exciting. I told him we should post play books and much more. Right now he is reluctant. I told him to step up and share. I see the potential. He has a very bad card delt him. He'd drop me if he knew I was telling the world.

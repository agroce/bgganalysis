From BGG: "Game mechanics: deduction, memory, hand-management, trading." Well, that about says it all. It's an Ann nightmare. Why I gave this a 5.4 I have no idea. 2.9 seems more fair. Not worth another play.

Its got some light player interaction, requiring you to gather enough information to deduce the value of the card at the centre of the table. Good fun!

Almost a Love Letter variant where you have to get two of your cards to sum to a single set-aside card.   It might be mechanically more interesting, but it's also not as flavorful (which sounds odd, but this is just card-counting numbers game).  The game is also more fragile and easy to screw up if you don't listen well.

One of the easiest print and play games to make, and definitely one of the most fun! The game plays really quickly with 2 (usually because of a Hail Mary guess on my part *LOL*) so we usually play 7 rounds (most wins of 7 wins the game overall). We loved the first set (Spies) so much that I've also made a second set (Vikings). This is our microgame and quick filler of choice, and the standard by which all other microgames are judged.

Like a lot of microgames, there's deduction - but wait! There's a second part to the game where you have to gather the right cards so you can guess what the hidden card is.

Actually, it's very similar to an idea that I had a while ago and was trying to complete the design for. Glad to see it worked alright.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
This was a very fun microgame that was also handed out for free at BGG.Con. The thing I liked about this game was that there was a hand management element to it. The idea is to figure out what card is in the middle but you don't just guess the card out loud. Instead, you have to have cards in your hand that add up to the total of the card in the middle. This makes it very important what information you share with the other players. Also, this played surprisingly well with two players whereas most microgames don't. Super happy that I got this one and my buddy Clifford was extremely jealous that he showed up late to the con and this game was already gone from the giveaway stash. Sorry Clifford!

Fun little game in which you try to identify the card that's put aside via looking at and trading cards with your opponent -- but the real catch is that, to get the card put aside (valued 0 to 5) you must have that sum in your two cards.

PLUS: simple but challenging
MINUS: just as a starter game

Seems a neat little memory/deduction game, playable with any deck of cards. Not usually a fan of card counting, but it feels only just beyond the comfort zone, which is perhaps the best place for a deduction game to be. Needs to be played with a variant to stop the two-player game being a bit flat.

Based on one play: Another one of these mini games that plays in about 10 minutes (per game, you generally play to a certain amount of points). The options are limited forcing an end game quickly. You must determine which card is not in the current hand by trading with others and asking questions. But you also give a way information by asking, so there are very limited options. Cute but after a few rounds it gets repetitive and you basically have to guess to have a chance of winning as generally everyone knows the outcome at the same time.

Dead Drop is a quick filler deduction card game.  Like in the classic Sleuth, people have a hand of cards, and everyone is trying to guess which card is face down in the middle.  On your turn, you trade cards either with a face-up card on the table, or with another player.  There's a complicating factor in guessing the card, though--you have to have a pair of cards whose sum is equal to the hidden card.  With no way to take notes, the game has a significant (though manageable) memory element.  Additionally, players are encouraged to make guesses with incomplete information, as otherwise they'll probably lose to another player who does.  The game is certainly different, but the combination of mechanics isn't particularly interesting to me.

Quick and incredibly "thinky" despite the initial simplistic appearance based on the game consisting of only 13 cards. Half-way through the first game you'll be thinking,"How can my brain possibly be working so hard right now!"

Delivers on the promise of a micro-deduction game. Having to both figure out the set-aside card AND have the right combination of cards in hand makes the game, and allows for hail mary plays that inject a dollop of drama into the proceedings.

If there's one knock against it, it's that there's not a lot of variance from one game to another. Obviously that's not a bad thing in a deduction game, but it starts to grate given that the game is so fast. For all that, still very, very solid.

2015-08-17: [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] It's interesting to try to deduce the shifting field of information, but for my tastes, it can wear out its welcome waiting for a single player to hit the target number of "wins". So, I doubt I'll suggest a proper full game any more, but it's a fun quickie!

2015-10-12: [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] (instead of dropping to [b][bgcolor=#ff66cc] 4 [/bgcolor][/b]) Confirmed: As with Apples to Apples and Bomberman, set the goal lower (2 wins for a single player) and this game is done before it grows old. Now, instead of a tired, bitter aftertaste, I find a pleasant flavor in my mouth at game end.

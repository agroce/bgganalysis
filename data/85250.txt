It's nice, but middle of the road. There's nothing that can be done about bad hands, which is a pretty essential element of trick taking games. Chronicle is way better.

My favorite Bruno Faidutti game. Dwarf king is like a grown up, tempered flux with trick taking. There are three suits, dwarves goblins and humans, and you spend a series of rounds trying to take tricks and earn enough points to win. The twist though is that at the beginning of each new round, when players are dealt a new hand, one of the players gets to select from a randomly generated pair of rules that define what tricks are worth in the round. So the objective is always changing. Sometimes you are trying to collect points by getting x type of sets, sometimes you are trying not to take sets because y sets are worth negative points so you want your opponents to take the hit. To top it off, there is a special card each round that adds a little more variety to the game. The dwarf king is truly a king among trick taking games.

I'm not usually a fan of trick-taking games, but I wanted to own one anyway to use it as a gateway game... since they are so widely played in Italy, I thought it could be a good idea. So I decided to buy the Dwarf King. What drew me into this game in particular was the artwork and the designer, but I thought also that the game had some nice ideas and it seemed more fun than other trick taking games I saw. I like the special cards a lot and the fact that scoring depends on the quest, which is different each round, sounded very cool.

Now that I tried it, I can say that I like this game. It's a nice addition to my small card game collection. Faidutti introduced some nice twists on the concept of trick-taking games and it plays very nice, but I also found out one small issue. Since the game changes so much from round to round, it doesn't work that well with new players and for sure it's not a good gateway game, even for the trick-taking games kind of crowd. It doesn't matter though, because I enjoy the Dwarf King anyway and I'm glad to own it.

I think this score is more relating to my dislike of trick taking games than any real measurement of the game itself. The quest idea, the theme, the slightly changing cards... kindof a cool twist.

Doesn't beat Tichu, which I'm told is not technically a trick-taking game. I did like that it plays 5 and the art was cool

When playing his game with five players I found that during at least half the rounds I had absolutely no choices (except obvious ones). The hand sizes are too small to offer any decent strategy when you are forced to follow suit.  There is no circumstance where I would want to play this game over my favorite trick taking game 'Five Hundred'.

Συμπαθητικό τραπουλοπαίχνιδο με μπάζες. Συνήθως βαριέμαι γρήγορα τα παιχνίδια με τράπουλα αλλά αυτό κατάφερε να μου κρατήσει το ενδιαφέρον καθώς σε κάθε γύρο ανοίγει ένα event που αλλάζει τους κανόνες για το σκοράρισμα (κυρίως το ποια φύλλα θέλεις να μαζέψεις/αποφύγεις). Επίσης σε κάθε γύρο βάζουμε στην τράπουλα και ένα σπέσιαλ φύλλο με ειδική ικανότητα. Μου άρεσε και το artwork στις κάρτες.

Τίποτα το ιδιαίτερο αλλά η καλή ποιότητα παραγωγής σε συνδυασμό με το ρευστό gameplay αφήνουν μια γλυκιά γεύση στο στόμα. Θα το ξανάπαιζα ευχαρίστως.

Fun, swingy trick taker in which your objective changes each hand. You may want to take or avoid tricks of a certain suit, or you may need to take an odd number of tricks in order to score points. Not as highly strategic as most trick taking games, but something quick and whacky to have a good time with.

Faidutti does trick-taking.  It seems that is the formula for my favorite trick-taking game.  This game has managed to climb to the top of my list in a genre where I already loved dozens of games.  The gameplay is so basic but just adding a single special card into each hand, and changing the goal for each hand turns it into something special.  In fact each hand is like its own game.  You may try taking all the tricks one hand, and then shoot to take none the next hand.  There are even hands where a single trick is all that matters.  There can occasionally be a runaway leader, or someone who falls so far behind that they can't hope to catch up, but the game is relatively quick so that doesn't sting too bad.  You have to love chaos to like this game, though.  There are many times when even playing your cards the best you can will not prevent you from taking an 8-point penalty or worse.  Personally that suits my personality just fine, so I find it to be an amazingly fun little game.  My only complaint is that I want more variety, like an expansion with more special cards and goals.

This is supposed to be trick-taking with a twist, which sounds right up my street. In practice, this was really dull and boring, being essentially almost the same as whist. The 'twist' is that victory conditions for that hand change every turn, and are chosen from 2 choices by one player. When we played, we found this was usually enough for him to win the hand as he could choose what was best for him. Nicely illustrated, but this is a stinker!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A pretty fun trick-taking game that is made interesting by the changing rules (and cards) from hand-to-hand.

While the game play is pretty much standard from hand-to-hand, the scoring is different every hand according to a tile that is flipped every round.  There are more tiles in the game than the number of hands you play, so you never know what will come up.   Each tile has two potential scoring rules on it, and the player that is dealt a specific card every round gets to choose which of those rules is in effect.  The scoring rules range from that choice being very important (a certain suit is worth positive or negative points for taking) to a total crap shoot (taking an even or odd number of tricks).  So, sometimes the player with the ability to choose has a meaningful decision to make, and sometimes it may as well be random.  Nevertheless, it can be frustrating for the players that never get dealt the card that allows the choice!

There is also one special card that gets shuffled into the deck each round, from a selection of a dozen or so.  These cards generally add one minor twist to the current round to watch out for, which can be somewhat interesting.

Overall, you get a fun little trick taker with a good dose of chaos infused.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like the idea of a trick taking game with rules that shift as you play.

However, by playing a certain number of rounds as opposed to to a certain number of points, it is quite likely that someone will be functionally eliminated from the game but forced to keep playing, which is a mechanic that I really despise.

The game has, however, made me ever more interested in On the Cards.

At first i hated this game, but now that i've played it again it's not as bad as i thought. Nice artwork and a fun twist on trick takers. But, the problem with this game is that some hands are sort of done long before they are actually done. It's difficult to keep up enthusiasm ror plaing when you realize all the points are taken and there are still several tricks to play through.

RATING: 6.4
Take straight-forward trick-taking game, but then add in a unique goal for each hand.  That's the premise here, and that small change is what makes The Dwarf King a unique game.

There isn't a lot of depth here, but players will have an amusing time trying to figure out how they can take tricks with the right cards in them (or avoid said tricks).  Nice art on quality cards, although their oblong shape makes shuffling a little tricky.

A trick taking game with a ton of luck.  Each hand offers 2 goals.  The player who gets dealt a specific card determines the goal...which is usually of the ilk...collect tricks to get points, or avoid tricks to get points.  So getting that card can be very important. Or at least have a hand equivalent to the person choosing the goal. I'd play it again, but would never seek it out.

Played for the first time. Really enjoyed this trick taking game. I had fun every round. 

Thing that I enjoy about this game is each round is different.

There is one different special card each round with interesting powers and the quest tile which also changes each round is also great which varies the number of points each round.

One round you can get positive points, another round you can get negative points. So each round have different objectives.

TRADED IT!

While I've yet to play this, I am so far disappointed with what I am seeing. The quality of the cards really is bad, and that stinks since they will be heavily used in play. The varied goals seem tacked on and is something you could really add to almost any game. Looking at the games beyond the goal tokens I was still excited to see this played.

Then once I found out that of all the neat specialty cards are not even all used in a normal round of play. The fact that only 1 neat card is used per game means way less fantastic art to look at and much less interest. I could of just used a deck of cards and said, "oh by the way... for this round the Joker gets X effect."


OK. played it now, and had fun. Would be a 6 if card quality was better.

Pretty random and pointless but I don't want to be too harsh as it's definitely targeted at kids. BGG says 10 and up. I think 8 and up would a more accurate target audience. There are only three suits, no trumps, no bidding or any other mechanism to mitigate a bad hand so if you've a crap hand, you'll lose. Throw in the random special effects and you could lose even worse. Or you could take an unassailable lead through no skill of yours.

RATING: 6
Simple filler. Really easy to teach but quite light for my taste, some quests make that after 3 tricks it's pointless to keep playing the hand and you have to move to the next quest, and I feel that having the knight musician is a big advantage usually. Finally there is nothing you can do to try to catch the leader as the cards and quests are random.

But hey it's a filler! You just play and laught at your bad luck and have fun.

Based on which objective cards are up, there can be a huge runaway leader problem. Some cards can gain someone as many as 20 points, while others max out at 5, and then there are ones that only give negative points. 

Game is a lot of fun, but very very very dependent on how the cards are dealt. Has potential to fall incredibly flat.

Ütésvivő játék érdekes csavarral: minden körben más-más célért megy az ütésvivés, másért jár pont. Ráadásul hogy pontosan miért, azt az egyik játékos választja ki, a kezdőkeze ismeretében. Ezen felül minden partyban van valami egyedi képeséget adó lap is. Mindez marha jó is lehetne a célok teljesítése teljességgel megjósolhatatlan. Páros vagy páratlan számú ütésem lesz-e? Lesz-e egy sort alkottó szett az elvitt lapjaim között? Így sajnos ami elsőre jónak tűnt, az inkább röhejes lett, mert egyszerűen közöd nincs hozzá, hogy bármit tervezz.

I thought it was 'ok'.  Not as much 'chaos' as I would expect from a Fadutti game.  I'm not a huge 'trick' taking fan, so take my 'ok' with a grain of salt.  I'd play it again.

It was interesting in a 5 player game, I scored 16 points while second place was at 0 and the rest ended in negative points.

I scored big early on and then most the rest of the hands were negative scoring rounds.  I'm not sure if that would be frustrating to some people or if it was just an oddity being our first game that some many times the 'negative' score was picked when available.  It seems 'easier' to avoid negatives then to score points.  So, once I scored big, I just needed to station keep while others weren't gaining much.

Simple trick taking game with some twists. Most of the twists do not add strategy to the game, unfortunately. The game would be a 6 if lasted 10 minutes, a 5 if it lasted 20 minutes. But, alas, it goes on for 30 minutes and is thus a 4.

RATING: 5
This is a relatively simple trick-taking game with a deck of only 3 suits. The cards are nicely illustrated and of good quality. They are extra-long, which makes them a bit unwieldy I think, but it's not a dealbreaker.

The scoring changes every round. For example, one round the blue cards might be worth a point each, other rounds they might lose you a point instead, and other rounds you might have a specific number of tricks to take with no regard for color. This is a nice twist, but the method by which the scoring is chosen is almost entirely random. Having players bid on the scoring method would have added a lot to the tactics of this game.

The other twist is that each round there is one special card added to the deck. It could be worth points for the person who takes it, it could be a trump, it could copy the last card played, etc. These add a touch of variety to the game, but really don't add much more in the way of strategy.

In fact, the scoring changes are actually a negative in some ways. Because some rounds have much higher potential for points than others, it is possible (and even likely) that the winner is determined before the last round is even played.

Ultimately, this game is simply too random for me to ever suggest playing it when there are much more strategic games that are just as easy to learn and only require a deck of cards. It's possible this could be a good game to bring out with non-gamers, but in that case, I wonder if the theme of belching dwarves and drooling goblins might not be a bit of a turnoff.

RATING: 7
I like trick taking, and while this isn't as deep or elegant as some, it makes for a reasonable filler. The meta-rules keep things different from hand to hand and some of them really make you re-evaluate the standard play. There are some special cards as well, but they're included with restraint- only one per hand to keep the chaos from getting totally out of control. A very pleasant surprise.

Este juego añade elementos interesantes: usando unas losetas especiales cada turno tiene unas reglas de puntuación diferente, hay unas cartas con poderes especiales y hay un mecanismo de selección de orden de jugadores.

And Brooke has now played in a game of Dwarf King. She wasn't too crazy about it, as she doesn't like trick-taking games all that much, nor does she like the negative points in many of the goals. I don't expect that should kill the game for us, but it's a shame she doesn't like it.

Combined with a strong emphasis on tactics at the expense of strategy, The evaluation skills required to play trick taking games escape me, and I'm not interested in pursuing them. I'd rather play [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/16632/gops]GOPS[/url] or any of it's reimplementations

Another trick point taking card game but with a fun theme tied together with nice artwork and a series of quests. It all works ... and this game is much better than its rating. The only criticism ... the cards are beautiful but soft around the edges so without care the laminated surface can peel at the edges. Go easy when you shuffle ... or get a shuffle machine. Some people would sleeve these cards but thats like putting plastic on the furniture :(

The Dwarf King is a great trick taking game which changes the rules a bit.  I like that there are only three suits, a new special card introduced each round and, most interesting is how each hand is scored different based on the active quest for the round.  It all fits together and makes for an enjoyable game.

I love how this takes the classic trick-taking mechanic and makes it more interesting round to round.  Every game will be different, there are so many possibilities.  This may be my favorite trick-taking game.  It's helpful if you print out a scorecard here on BGG and add some little tokens to track the score.  Brilliant little game.

I'm not a huge fan of trick-taking games, but I really enjoy this game. The interactions of the special card and changing goals make it different every time. It does seem to drag on however, and I appreciate it more when capped at 5, or even 3, hands, rather than the full 7.

Fun game. Most of my family doesn't like it much though and would rather just play Spades. I like it because it gives you more to think about other than just do I take all tricks or take no tricks. I seem to lose a lot though and I haven't decided just how much of a factor luck is.

RATING: 6.5
This is an average trick taking game with typical rules (no trump).  There are two things that make it stand out.  The first is that every hand, a special card is included.  An example is a suited 11 that is -3 points for whoever takes it. Everyone knows in advance what the card will be, and it's shuffled in the deck before dealing. Players have to remember the card and play accordingly.  The second thing is that every turn, there will be a rule that dictates how scoring will be.  So it isn't just about playing to win the most tricks, it's about playing according to what the rules are.  It's easy to teach and learn, which makes it a nice addition to the family of trick taking games.

Good trick taking game with just a touch of chaos. Well thought out variations. (Quests) each hand. We usually just play to 20 points. That requires about 4 or 5 hands. Nice sense of humor but not too bizarre like I initially worried. I think this game deserves more buzz

Quick, light, fun, random take on trick taking card games. 

Some of the scoring cards are good - some are just too random (or make most tricks pointless) but the hands are fast enough that it's ok.

Enjoy this a fair bit - but i like classic trick taking games anyway....

Meh. Don't really want to bother with playing this one again.

LIKES:

* The only thing I really liked about this game was that there was one special card that got added to each round that made each round slightly different.

DISLIKES:

* No trump in this otherwise standard trick taking game.
* Goals for points seemed quite random/chaotic.  Took a lot of strategy and planning out of the game - much of what I usually appreciate about trick taking games.

RATING: 5
I like trick-taking games but I'm usually wary of trying out new ones because the most common thing people add to them is business where every card has some kind of special power and card X cancels card Y except when card Z is in retrograde and someone is already looking up a "Fizzbin" video clip to cleverly comment on this with. The Dwarf King cuts down on this by only putting in one special card per round, and it's usually nothing too obnoxious. 

It also has a set of tiles that determine what scores this round, and this is where it's at its weakest. In the attempt to add more tiles for more variety, some of them are just not very interesting. There's one where only a single card in the deck causes any kind of point change, and that's dull. Honestly, I think the game would do better if there were, say, five score conditions and whoever gets to pick chooses from one of them.

It's a game like Hearts where you take tricks but whether or not you score it depends on the quest of the round or something. So is it a fun game? I think it is as the quests gives it a variation that makes the game a little exciting. But I guess there are better games out there. But for it's pretty ok.

Trick taking (which I like) and i like the added differential scoring. 

This is like hearts with more variable rules. I think it would have been easier to explain the rules that way.

This is good ut what does it add over "chase the lady". Well with 3-4 players you do not have so many cards which is better. So does that get over the hassle of the extra cards/tiles. Not sure.

I finally got to play this one, after sitting on the shelf for 18 months. It was about what I thought it would be-light and silly. The thing I like best though (though it may be difficult to articulate) is that this game isn't heavy-handed. It's a trick-taker without feeling too much like a trick-taker, if that makes sense. Diamonds, for example, is a solid game, but it feels like a trick-taker on steroids. When you're not a huge fan of the trick-taking genre, you need a game that doesn't take it self too seriously, and the Dwarf King does a great job in that regard.

RATING: 4
Similar to Ghoooost! (by Richard Garfield, also published by IELLO), this is really crap.

The ideas are nice. Removing a suit and using it to create some cards with special effect is fun, but not enough to make the game worthwhile.


The ways you score points in the game is completely pointless. Sure it varies each game but not in a good way. If the player deciding which objective variant to pick is usually not confident they will win, it often ends up with the negative one, which just means players are fighting to avoid negative points. It's just not fun.

The game is struggling with similar issues like Seiji Kanai's Chronicle is with boring scoring objectives and ways to score points.


The most fun we had while playing it was when the mission that came up was: Gain 1 point for each trick, or lose 1 point for each trick. If that's the most fun mission we had in the game, all other rounds were worse than a regular deck of cards and playing for highest number. And that's just sad.

And this game to come from Faidutti. I don't understand why he would release it.

Very standard trick taking game with one special card each round and a different goal each round. The gameplay was variant enough each round due to the plethora of quests, but the tricktaking itself was bland because you have if you have the strong cards you win the hand, meaning that interactivity is fairly low and you don't have many meaningful choices. OK game that I don't mind having in my collection.

Was hoping this would be in the same style of Chronicle, which it is, but it isn't nearly as good. The goals are perhaps a little more even-handed, but I found the card play to be boring. If one game could somehow combine the best parts of both, it would fire both. In choosing between the two, however, I will always go with creative card play over concrete goals. Therefore, The Dwarf King does not unseat Chronicle from my collection.

Simpatico gioco di carte che si rifà al Tressette; al posto dei semi (quadri, picche ecc.) troviamo delle razze fantasy (solo tre, che sono: umani, nani e goblin). Ogni mano sarà caratterizzata da un obiettivo differente (fanno punto solo gli umani, fare solo 1 presa ecc.) mantenendo per il resto però le medesime regole. Il gioco è semplice e godibile, apprezzabilissimo anche se l'incidenza della fortuna è spesso determinante.

I enjoy the zany variety of scoring goals every round. Keeps things interesting! Artwork is great, too.

However, it can be a bit TOO zany. Some card/goal combinations can give way too many points (basically winning the game in a single hand), amplifying lucky hand deals that already exist in this kind of game.

A trick taking game with a deck of special cards and some variation tiles. The cards are in three suits (Dwarves, Goblins & Knights) plus some additional special cards with extra powers. The tiles establish the score conditions for each round; capture a certain number of tricks, or specific cards, or the inverse, etc. Normal trick-taking rules apply - follow suit, no requirement to head the trick or to trump. The cards are an odd size (large and long) that makes shuffling annoying and probably causes children difficulty, but they look good.

People who like traditional trick taking cardgames might get some fun out of The Dwarf King. Alternatively they could play Turn the Tide or Ninety-Nine. [i]Chronicle[/i] is a significantly better game, in a box 1/5 the size. It also has good art.

Basically the same game, and same wild chaotic ride, as Friese's Stichmeister, except here you have 3 suits, 1 scoring card and 1 twist card (whereas the other has 4 player-selected cards which could be any combination of score and twist). It's pleasant to play, as all trick taking games are, and enjoyable if everyone's happy to play along for the fun of it, but probably not so much for those who feel they must emotionally invest in a win. It's easier to teach and more accessible than Stichmeister, but if you're going to play along for the ride, perhaps Stichmeister provides a touch more wildness. But it's all much of a muchness.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Dissapointing. It tries the same as Friedemanns Stich-Meister but (depite Im not a huge fan of that either) fall short. The chaos factor is as high as you suspect with Faidutti (which is OK), but many combinations of special card and scoring rules are simply uninteresting. If two thirds of the tricks are meaningless (because only few cards score) a whole lot of the game is short on tension.
Nothing bad here, but nothing that enhances the crowded genre of trick taking games either.

If you notice from my previous owned list, a majority of them is from good old Bruno. This one of my favourite ones, which I wasn't planning to purchase and it went out the door for that reason, maybe a bit too hastily but alas Bruno your games are so chaotic that I sometimes follow suit in real life. As a trick taking game, this is standard fair. The twist is the objectives and different power cards in each game. The production and graphics are excellent and enjoyable, so much so I am saddened that I cannot pick it up to have a look at it today. The subtracting element with the objectives is that it slows the flow of the game and can be frustrating when you cannot select the objective after a string of choices going against the strength of your hand, time after time. In other words there are better trick taking games out there.

Didn't make the cut because whoops!

Trick-taking game, but if you want tricks and which kind of tricks varies each round as the quest tile changes. In fact a very nice idea, but there is one thing that bothers me and that is that what the condition is, is chosen by one player (the one whom holds the blue 5). He is by that the only player who can look at his/her hand and adapt what will be scored according to which cards they were given. I think that's for certain quests too much power.

Being from Indiana, where Euchre is kind of a State-wide obsession, one can tire of game after game after game.  So, I'm always on the lookout for games that kind of replicate the trick-taking "fun" of Euchre without actually being Euchre.  And this one fits the bill nicely.  Plays quickly, nice components (although I question how long the cards will last, and sleeving really isn't an option with their strange size), and a fun theme make this a fantastic option.  Highly recommended.

I prefer trick taking games in which every trick and every card is significant. Some goals in this game (i.e. only several cards are worth points) are not very exciting.

BTW, I do think Chronicle is better than this one, but The Dwarf King plays much more briskly.

Maybe i'm just not very good at this game, but it seemed like the changing scoring conditions didn't matter very much when there was almost zero strategy. The scoring conditions also seemed very unbalanced. Some would score +4 points for each card of a certain type you had, while most others would give you +1/-1. This lead to a runaway leader early in our game that couldn't lose unless they were trying their hardest to fail.

I'm usually not a huge fan of trick taking games, and my first play of this hit me with a ton of bad luck before other people showed up at game night and we ended the game early.  Trick taking games kind of stress me out more than other game genres for some reason, and the fact the the scoring rules change every round makes it more stressful.

This game is very much like Chronicle.  It is a standard trick-taking game with 3 suits but the catch is that the victory condition of each hand changes.  You are supposed to play this game in 7 rounds and each round one player (decided by who took the 5 of one of the suits in the previous round) reveals a tile with two "quests" on it such as +3 points for each '9' taken or -3 points for each '9' taken and chooses one to set the point scoring (or losing) requirements to for that round.

Like I said, this is very similar to Chronicle so I find myself comparing it directly to that.  Chronicle is a fine game but one I only want to play occasionally when there is a small gap between other, heavier games.  The Dwarf King is the same way but I actually like it a bit better.  The reason is because the "quests" are a lot more varied and interesting than those in Chronicle.  I also prefer the point scoring a little bit more to the 3 wins victory condition of Chronicle but that does also introduce some stagnant hands where nobody gets points or runaway leaders.

I do still like the individual powers on each card in Chronicle instead of only one special card in each hand.  It makes the game more varied but it also makes it less accessible and more chaotic.  In the end, this game is a very good filler that I will reach for reasonably often in those short gaps.

The variable objectives and one special card per round make for a very interesting game.  It can be VERY swingy for those not paying attention.  In my first game on the final round one person dropped from first place to last place.

- Light humorous game art
- Different quest and special card every turn keep the game changing and fresh.
- Great twist on the trick taking genre. It both simplify the gameplay and upped the renewing possibilities.

:thumbsdown: DISLIKE
- Usual crappy card quality from IELLO. For a trick taking card game where cards are constantly shuffled and distributed, this is inexcusable. Cards shouldn't show wear after only 10 deals.

:star: VERDICT
Not overly strategic or competitive, if taken light heartily it is really fun.
A solid 8 with the 2 quests variant.

[IELLO 2011 edition] {Fantasy; trick-taking; optimal 3p} Bruno really likes trick-take games.  This is a fun trick-taking game variant: action cards and scoring rules.  A typical game is interactive and short; this makes it a very good filler.

There is nothing new here, but the cute illustration is refreshing.

the game quality is awesome.  The card illustration is cute and colorful.  The card stock and tiles are thick.  Good.

It's a trick taking game where the scoring condition changes each round. Some rounds you'll score negative points, other rounds you may score a high number of points. Some rounds you'll be trying to actively win the round, and others to not score any tricks. The scoring condition for each rounds changes up the strategy for each hand; however, as a downside, this variability can also lead to very ineffective hands (more so than in other trick taking games, it seems) or large point swings that can be hard to make up.

If the dynamic nature sounds interesting to you and you're a fan of trick taking games, The Dwarf King may be a fun change of pace. Overall, the round-to-round variability will be a detraction for some people, but I think it makes the game rather interesting though a bit chaotic at times.

A favourite of mine trick taking game. You need to play with the 3-color cube variant posted here in BGG.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game has 3 suits, with the standard 13 cards in each suit. But every round there will be one extra card, which is pulled from a separate deck of about 20 possible cards. The extra card could be a 1, 11 or some other weird card. All the extra cards have different powers/abilities/scoring. So one might say if you take the following trick you get three points. Another might say you draw two random cards from another player and give him two cards from your hand. Another might be a trump card (the game doesn't otherwise use trumps) but can be beaten by any ace. Weird random stuff.

Also, every round a new goal card is revealed and the player with the blue 5 chooses which of the two goals applies. These might be stuff like green cards are negative points and 8's and 9's are also negative points with the green 8 & 9 giving two negative points. Or Jacks are four points. Or there's one card in the deck that gives points and nothing else matters. Again, it's pretty random.

The person with the red 5 starts the round by leading, but doesn't have to lead the red 5.  You play seven hands and see who has the most points.

Dwarf King was an odd duck. Usually trick taking games are, pardon the pun, a one-trick pony. So you're always trying to do the same thing throughout the whole game. Which means that while a particular hand may screw you, better play will probably pan out in the long run. If the goal is to take tricks, you'll probably end up with a few hands where you have good cards and if you play those well, it offsets a bad hand or two. But the randomness in Dwarf King means that you might get low cards on a hand when you want to take tricks and high cards in a round when you don't. Things don't necessarily balance out in the long run and it's really a lot more about if you get a good hand for each particular round.

It was interesting to get that much variety in a trick taking game. At times it felt like I was playing Hearts, Wizard, Knaves, and a couple other trick taking games. That was novel, but I think unbalanced. The random power cards make it a little wonky too. Being the only person who could toss off two bad cards on one hand was a little random. As was everybody switching hands in another round.

I wouldn't call Dwarf King bad... but I'd prefer to play other trick taking games. I like games where you play for the long game, making do best you can with bad hands and making your fortune on your good hands, knowing that you'll do okay as long as you play all your hands well. I felt that it was more important to get lucky on the right hand in Dwarf King than it was to play well over the entire set of hands.

About [thing=85250][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=85250][/thing] is a trick-taking game, in which players score points accordingly to goals, that are different each round. Some cards have special powers when played (like giving extra points, or taking cards from someone's hand in exchange of others from yours, and even allowing players to change the hand of cards one have with someone else).

Trick-taking, by nature, are a genre with games that range from ok to little control, even when the cards don't have special abilities that change the play course. When those are added, is possible to: a) increase control; b) increase chaos. Almost all trick-taking games I know that have cards with special powers went to the B route (more chaos). [thing=85250][/thing] is no exception.

The cards that allow players to exchange hands (one is always present and other is an special card) simply almost destroy the chances someone to plan ahead, as there is no way to know if you are going to keep the cards you are seeing for one, two, three tricks. You can lose the cards at anytime and receive a completely new hand. Yes, the player that has the card that make the players exchange hands do have more saying, and can use the early tricks in order to make her hand trashier as possible before giving them away. Still, being a trick-taking in which players must follow suit, this isn't always possible: if the suit is pulled, you might just need to play the card without being able to really prepare.

[thing=85250][/thing] is similar to [thing=54307][/thing], as in both there are cards with special powers and the goal of the round changing each rounds.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
One special card is draw and showed to everyone, entering in the deck. After dealing the cards, a tile with two goals for the round is revealed - these are the ways to score in that round. The player with the 5 of knights (blue) picks one of the two to be the one valid for the round - the other is ignored. Than, the player with the 5 of goblins (red) start the first trick.

Players must follow suit, if able. Regardless if following suit or not, cards with special powers are activated when played (either with an immediated effect or a latent one). There is no trump: highest card of the suit of the trick takes the cards played.

Once the round ends and points are tallied, the score tile and the special card are put in the box, and new ones, for both, are revealed.

The game lasts for 7 rounds after which the player with the most points, wins!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Which card to play. This isn't always true, as following the trick can take this decision away sometimes. But, for most of the time, you will get to decide which card to play and which to save for later (remembering that, later you might not have the same hand of cards).

The exchange of hands of cards makes the whole play have a different way to see what to play - in several trick-taking games players try to set up plays for later, by playing and holding certain cards. While this is also possible in [thing=85250][/thing], when you consider that there is no way to truly know who will have the cards you are holding, specially early on, before the card that allow the trade of hands is played, the usual is to play fast the best cards and only set up bad plays for later - and, even still, you can end up with this bad hand yourself - put you can play the odds with more chances on your side when there are more persons playing (4 or 5).

It is truly hard to make decisions that aren't for immediate gain in [thing=85250][/thing].

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Good production value: the box hold the cards sleeved, the tiles for scoring are sturdy, and the art on the cards are well done;
- Different ways to score in each round makes the game fresh and players thinking in different ways.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Trick-taking games usually have a lot of luck built in. When you add chaos and take a bite of the small amount of control players have, you aren't doing the game a service;
- Scores vary a lot, and I'm not only saying positive or negative (there are ways to score only negative points in a round), but also in range;
- Seven rounds makes the game run a little too long - the proposed 40 minutes is in a very low end of playing time, as rounds usually won't be over in around 5 minutes each when you have to play 13 cards (in a 3 players game) every round, or have more people (4 or 5) making tatical decisions - around 60 minutes is more likely.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like in an unfair game show. Due to the way scoring works, even doing well in one round can be widely different than doing the same in other. One round can give around 2-10 points, while another can give from 4-24, or more, considering one special card can double the amount of points earned in a round. This is bound to make players feel cheated, as if participating in a bad TV game show, in which for several rounds you are there, pressing quickly the buzzer, answering well, doing neatly the tasks demanded, and getting your points, putting you in the lead, with 250 points. Then comes the Final Question, worth 1000 points! The crowd goes wild, as now everyone is all in. The ones behind cheer, as they have a chance to win. The ones ahead ask why do they even bothered?

[thing=85250][/thing] has some neat ideas, serving as a less confrontational version of [thing=54307][/thing], as this one has lots of stealing and affecting the cards of other players, while in [thing=85250][/thing] the tricks you have taken are yours, for better or for worst.

In the end, [thing=85250][/thing] is a serviceable trick-taking - it isn't broken nor offends those that like this type of games, however, and can even provide some interactions not usual to the genre, as the changes in ways to score, the addition of special cards and their powers, make the hands feel like different games combined into one, and even inside the rounds, the guaranteed exchange of hands involving two players (a bigger thing in a 3p game than in a 5p), make the usual flow playing need some hard adjustments each time, which can be a big appeal. But [thing=85250][/thing] doesn't really shine and I can't recommend it to others, except big fans of trick-taking that want to constantly challenge themselves with the caveat that one rounds will simply be more valuable than others. Therefore, [thing=85250][/thing] gets only a restricted recommendation.

I enjoyed this more than I expected I would. It's basically bridge with enough variations to make it distinct from a standard deck of cards. The theme is very thin: there are three suits--dwarf, knight, and goblin--and different "quests," which set the scoring rules for taking tricks. Otherwise, however, the suits and quests are pasted on top. It's still enjoyable, but would not be enjoyable to somebody adverse to bridge or standard card games.

Played with 5 people and was actually a lot of fun.

Basically a trick taking game with different win conditions for each of seven hands.

I think the entire group enjoyed it - even those who have never played the more basic games like spades or hearts.

Praticamente uma Sueca com regras especiais extras, que deixam o jogo menos engessado e mais rejogável.

Whoof.  This is a pretty chaotic game, though that shouldn't come as any surprise to people who see who designed it.  Its saving grace is that it's a trick-taking game where trick avoidance can play a large part of the game, which is something I tend to do well enough.  The three suits are a bit limiting, though, and can create situations where you have a crap hand, and nothing to do to alleviate it, since there's no trump in the standard rules.  It's slightly reminiscent of Stich-Meister, but that game offers more control, since you can at least control one of the rules in the game.

The artwork and design of this game is gorgeous, and it improves with fewer numbers of players, but there are other, better trick-taking games out there that I would prefer to play.

What I Like-
Fun trick taking game where each hand scores differently, leading to variety. 
What I dislike-
Some scoring rules can score can lead to bigger leads than others, leading to the winner of that rule to have a big advantage if the following scoring rules are relatively weak, making it necessary to win 2 or 3 tricks to catch a player who scored big one with a big scoring gap potential.
May try to play each scoring rule from a couple to several times before changing rules between rounds to give other players a chance to avoid huge swings in scoring.

If you are a card player, I believe you will like this game.  So if you are into Bridge or Hearts or other trick taking games and don't mind a silly theme, try this one out.  The scoring changes every round, which is kind of a fun twist.

A simple trick taking card game ... ,maybe this is not bad in itself, i like simplicity. The problem is The Dwarf King is exteremely cahotic. It does causes some roaring laugh from time time, I can concede this, but the gaming experience proves to be quite shallow. You can't have any strategy, just some tactics from round to round.
I don't like the fact that choosing the round rule is random as it seems to be quite an advantage since you can decide based on your hand.

Art is quite nice but not enough to save this game.
Maybe its greatest value is as a child game or very light sort of intro to games... but intro to what? since most of succesfil games require strategy and you will never use it in this game...

3人でプレイすると壮絶な読み合いガチゲームに。
勝利条件が変化し、特殊カードが入れ替わることで、「今回のラウンドでは自分の手札からどう勝つのか」、もしくは「勝っている人を邪魔するのか」のプレイング方針が毎回変わって楽しい。
カードの強さが変わるなどの複雑さが無いので初心者にも勧めやすいです。

問題は、組み合わせによってはクソゲー展開に。
ナイトの5、ゴブリンの5の能力をディールされたらではなく、前のゲームで獲得してたらにするとバランス変わるかも。

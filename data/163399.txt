Great starter set for Infinity. Foldable cardboard terrain is nice as the game is really only good with dense terrain.

RATING: 8.8
Great starter set for new players coming into the Infinity verse.  However, once through this set, the rules for the game become a bit more daunting.  There is a definite learning curve to this system. Models are great, terrain is wicked important and I would not switch back to 40k if you paid for me too.

There looks to be a lot of depth to this miniatures game, and a lot of fun to be had in the mechanics, but not a lot of interested parties in my group.

Just don't pay full retail. It might not be obvious from the box, but all of the tokens are paper.

Well, I actually only own half... a buddy and I split it, I took PanO and he the Nomads.  We were looking for a miniatures games that wasn't Games Workshop.  This seemed to fit the bill as a small skirmish game.  Lots of fun!

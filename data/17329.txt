Stacking the game pieces is absurdly fun.  I'm not a big fan of the actual game though.  The rolling of the dice to decide who and how many things to stack is really contrived, and winning the game feels more like the result of luck than skill or creativity.

On rainy days I bust this out and rock it solo like a newborn babe.

The die mechanics is unfun, we usually make as many lines of animals as players and every turn one has to choose the first animal of any queue.

RATING: 8
awesome game for family. Fun for kids and parents. Deciding what your opponent should place takes this game to a level of depth that is perfect, allowing very young kids to enjoy the game, but as they grow, think deeper about it. You don't see the hypothetical thinking in too many good kids games.

This is a great kids' stacking game and is almost THE perfect stocking filler for ages 4-8.  Adults have a lot of fun with it too, that's for sure.  It's cettainly a lot cuter and quicker to set up and play than Jenga, so go on, get a copy...you know it makes sense!

I enjoy stacking games and Tier auf Tier is a decent one.  Gamers will find the crocodile die result rather too gentle (it adds a piece adjacent to the crocodile, widening the base of the structure.  My preferred variant crocodile result is to place a piece on the crocodile - touching its nose or the tip of its tail, if that remains possible.

This is a typical HABA production with nice chunky, colourful animal pieces.  The English language rules are fine.

This is a nice dexterity game for kids with some excitement for adults as well.  I've played two players only, and it was fun, though we decided that rolling the crocodile should mean a reroll in the two player game.  Otherwise, you end up with a bunch of animals on the base and practically none on top (especially if you keep rolling crocs as we did).

EDIT: Five and a half years later, and I play some more, even own it.  This is a great game for kids AND adults.  Yes, there's luck in the die rolling, but everyone gets a chance to pull off some spectacular stacking.  Good stuff.

RATING: 8
Belongs to my children.

This is a great children's game. Lots of opportunities for skill building (pincer grasp/dexterity, assessment of risk) and plays swiftly. The rule where the person who knocks over the animals only takes back two of the total knocked down pieces is a rule that makes this game better than it would be without it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
9/8/17: Upping my rating because my kids who just turned three love this game even though they aren't so good at stacking.  Much better than many other kids games out there.

8/9/2006: Rating is for playing with kids.  An okay game for playing with kids, but nothing that excites me.  My 8 year old niece thinks so also.  Will only pull out to throw in some variety when playing with her.  Maybe needs to be played with younger children.

As I'm not the real target audience for this game, my rating is influenced by my daughter's opinion (she's 3 and a half at the time of this comment).

She really enjoy stacking the animals and has a huge laugh when they fall down, especially when it happens to me or her mother.
I started stacking a little odd to make the game more difficult for me. However, she quickly adopted that [b]and became quite good in no time[/b].

I'm not sure if it's a good sign that I've played this game as much as I, but the people I play with seem to prefer this game over Bausack... any version of Bausack... which means that Bausack may go on the trade pile... noooooooo....

Still, this is a cute game, and it's very short, and it's Bausack-like enough, although I think bidding rules would be a good idea.  Or maybe not.  

I may get another copy so that we increase the number of animals.  But what I really want is an expansion with more different kinds of animals.

I'm fond of dexterity games, but a little less excited by stacking games where a steady hand has an advantage. However there's something a little different about this kids game. Jenga with animal shapes instead of straight boards? Suddenly you have something kind of fun. I like the idea of putting giraffes on top of sheep, and flamingos on top of bats. The whole thing is just goofy fun. Now the rules aren't exactly elegant. If one person makes the stack collapse they fall so far behind that it becomes virtually impossible to recover. Luckily the game is short, so this sort of player elimination isn't that big a deal. I can really see kids getting into this game, because the animals are so cute, and there is a nice variety. If I had kids this would be a must-buy. You get so many nice chunky wood pieces in the box, too. Now when I was taught it was mentioned that the teacher had heavily house-ruled the game, so I'm not 100% sure how different the game might be under the rules as written. I don't know if it would make much difference for me, though. It's a decent game, but not one that I currently need in my collection.

Average dexterity game, very nice wooden pieces.  Too luck-heavy for my taste... the die roll can be really good (ex. make another person play your animal) or really bad (ex. you must place 2 animals ontop of the stack).  There are very few opportunities to try to mitigate the luck.  My clammy & unsteady hands put me at a disadvantage too.

Components are wonderful, and stacking is joyous and always in new ways. Requires focus and hand-eye coordination, which are developed in a fun way.

However, gameplay rules seem tacked on, and it feels like a slightly unfinished game.

Bought this for my daughter. Tested it out. It's actually pretty good, and can be a little challenging as the animals are all very strangely shaped. I wish there were details printed on both sides of the animal but its not that big of a deal. When playing with my wife we each took 14 animals to make it a little more challenging.

My daughter (currently 2) loves this game and will often ask to play it. She understands many of the simpler concepts of the game and has a blast playing it!

RATING FOR KIDS. Great dexterity game for kids. The dice rolling makes things a little too random, but that's a minor thing as kids always laugh while playing.

RATING: 6
Games can't really get more simple than this.  On your turn, roll a die and stack an animal based on the result.  Animals are simply stacked on top of the poor base alligator, who has to hold all of the animals!

If you cause the stack to fall, you must take all of the animals that fell.  The first person to get rid of all their animals onto the stack wins!

This is really marketed as a kids game, but I've also found it to be enjoyable as a dexterity filler with adults.

Great multi-age fun, this is a classic! 

Although in my experience, while this is recommended for 4+, children younger than 7 or so can't really compete. In our family, this has been enjoyed more from 8 and up.

RATING: 7
A terrific example of how to do a kid's game right. The rules are simple and fun (determine who goes first by seeing who can stand on one leg like a flamingo for the longest amount of time). The dice rolls give a bit of player interaction but don't complicate things or make the game too unpredictable. The animals are very cleverly designed to fit together and provide unexpected stacking configurations. The components are terrific, all nicely finished and made of thick wood. 

I bought this as a christmas present for my niece, opened it to check that the pieces weren't sharp or splintery (the pieces are perfect for 3+, some are a bit small for stupid babies who like to eat random objects) and to read the rulebook so we could play it as soon as she opened her present. My boyfriend and I ended up playing the game for about an hour, non-stop. It's super fun for adults too; try not to giggle when you see some of the sexy, sexy positions you can get the animals into.

Okay, this game is undeniably adorable. And the shapes of the animals make the stacking fun, but after one play I'm worried I may not really need this when I have things like Bausack and Villa Paletti around.

The main problem with this game is the die - it makes it feel like winning and losing is mostly luck, and you can get into a weird situation where you keep rolling alligators making it all feel pretty pointless.

So far I've only played this with two players, so I'd be curious to try with more. Though I'm skeptical that it would affect my rating.

It might be targeted at kids, but this game is a lot of fun for teenagers and adults as well! It's a simple dexterity game in the vein of "Klumpeduns/Klodsmajor", but it's much more fun due to the tons of differently shaped cute animals. It's basically just enjoyable to play this short, light game, and everybody is always holding their breath when a player tries to place a piece on top.

My wonderful wife bought me this game in our effort to begin a decent kid's collection. And I gotta tell ya, although I'm just learning what it takes to design a great children's game, one clear factor is designing a game that still provides some amount of entertainment for the adults.

I'm impressed by this game... it's quite clever. The dexterity element is plenty fun for adults as well (intoxicated or otherwise). And as for kids, I look forward to trying this one out. Heck, I'd imagine they'd have fun just stacking the shapes without the rules.

Good stuff, and along with Worm Up (and if I can ever find it!) Gulo Gulo, I'm very impressed with today's game options for kids.

How is this a kid's game? I think playing this with a child would be really boring. With adults it is a challenge and an absolute blast. We have made two important house rules to keep the game challenging:

1. We have eliminated the gator face of the die. If you roll a gator, you stack one animal. This creates some seriously awesome towers as players are forced to add to the small amount of available space on the gator's back. 

2. You always have to stack your last animal. Even if you roll the hand you have to do your own dirty work to win.

Nice little dexterity game, though it hasn't captured my kids' attention to the degree I thought it might.  Gets too easy if you allow adults or older kids to place more than one animal beside the alligator on the table but that works well for our youngest child.  We currently prefer Purzelspinne (Tumbling Spiders).
Edit:  We've finally played a couple of games where rolling the alligator wasn't nearly as much of a factor.  The game is MUCH more fun this way!

Recent:  This game has become a staple family-filler game.  We combined two sets of the duel version to the main game and just divide up all the animals between players.  Lots of laughs, friendly taunting and cut-throat placements.  Often requested when there's only 20-30 minutes available for gaming.

2010: This was a fun dexterity game for kids.  I enjoyed the two games we played, though I think they were a little young to fully understand.  Either way, playing with the pieces kept them entertained and fun was had by all.

Honestly, it's cute but there isn't much here and it's super short; bt to each their own.

It's a very small and simple dexterity game that would be completely symmetrical were it not for the randomness added by a die that mixes things up a bit and can either have no real effect or go so far as to force your opponent to take one of your pieces or make you place two pieces. Whoever gets rid of all their pieces first wins, but if any animals fall off the stack, then you have to take them back.

If you end up playing games with kids, this is a really good place to start.  Even if you're not playing with kids, I'm willing to bet that there's no group of adults that can resist the charismatic animals in this game, and slight rules tweaks make it still challenging.

A dexterity game that aims to teach about turn order, game play, rules and how to win/lose a game. I picked it up for our 3-1/2 year old and he loves it. The most difficult concepts right now are getting him to understand that you don't want more animals (the goal is to get rid of the animals) and that the speech bubble means WE pick the animal he has to place, not him. This feels like a natural progression from First Orchard for his development and I like that it's showing that it's normal for families to play games at the table instead of watching TV.

Animal Upon Animal: Это игра была популярна? Хоть в какой-то год? Не примите за сарказм, но я её просто обожаю. Трудно себе представить, что было время, когда мир обходился без этой простой, но весёлой игры для вечеринок. А если ли шансы, что в 2016-м году придумают игру для вечеринок, в которую будут играть и через 10 лет?

Players are attempting to be the first to stack their seven wooden animals.  Simple children's game.  Players on their turn roll a die and follow the instructions on the result.  It usually means taking one or two animals and trying to balance it on the rapidly increasing stack on the back of a large wooden crocodile.  Very easy to teach children, from three years and up.  Fun, pretty, but not a patch on others such as Gulo Gulo, or Chicken Cha Cha Cha.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Awesome game! A blast, & harder than you'd think. I like the self-balancing aspect (occasionally removing animals from the game). It keeps the game from going on forever like some dexterity games. For 2-players, you need to use more animals.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.2
Got this for my son, who's about three years too young to play. Impressed with the quality & cuteness of the blocks, and how well it plays for adults as a 10-minute filler.  And we haven't tapped the drinking game possibilities yet.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Idea:
Each player tries to pile animals upon animals and if they fall other pick one discard rest. If you succeed next player has even bigger tower to put animal onto. First one without animals wins.

Mechanism:
Each player throw die and either place 1-2 animals on top, 1 on bottom or give animal to another player.

to whom:
GOod for kids or to play with kids (4+), increases manual dexterity and patience, practically no rules, enough replayability until they grow.

This is a really fun stacking game for kids, but, unlike games like Jenga, the shapes are not the same, so the object is to figure out how to stack odd looking shapes in the most stable manner.

A cute, simple, short stacking game. The components are excellent. The rules are simple. A great game for little ones especially since you can chuck the rules aside and just have fun with the pieces. For you big kids it makes a fine drinking game.

I am a bit disappointed that with three adult players who were trying to make it difficult for one another we managed to stack all our animals and the tower didn't fall at any point. I will be looking into house rules for this one.

After a few more plays with different groups I can see the appeal of this. It is actually tricky to get all the animals balanced.... apparently we were just on really good form for that first game

My 3 year old grandson does not have enough dexterity to play this game yet, even though he is attracted to this game.  I don't have enough dexterity either--I only get a few pieces up, then I knock them over.  It is hard.

A good game to play with young children.  The different options indicated by the dice gives this game a little variety.  Good components, short, fun for kids.

Played this with Britta, and decided not to use TaT - DD rules and used "Animal Upon Animal" rules instead ... and eventually decided to see how many we could pile up on the crocodile (and in front of it and behind it) ... we made it to the second-to-last piece and the pyramid collapsed.  Might try it again with Britta (she likes it alot more than I do).

Tier auf Tier is an aesthetic treat as much a great stacking game.  The unique shapes of the animals, the variable decisions to make on a turn as result of a die roll, the fast playing time, and quite possibly the best meeples in the business all add up to making this a brilliant filler (and current favorite).  A couple adjustments to the rules make this a truly formidable stacker, and allows for varying difficulty for different ages.  Two sets allow for up to eight to play, adding more fun.

I play with a simple rule change -- ignore i.e. reroll the crocodile icon. This forces folks to build up instead of out, meaning there are more collapses -- and more fun! Or even better -- have the crocodile mean you have to rotate the crocodile 90 degrees, which has the side benefit of giving more folks a straight-on view.

First game I played with my son. At 3.5yrs he is sometimes a bit too enthusiastic about placing the animals and thinks he wins every time they fall but it seems he is very happy to play a real game with his parents. Toppling a big tower of animals never gets old. Great introduction to the concept of playing a game.

This is a simple but very strong dexterity game. The pieces are not only really cute toys, they are also interesting things to stack. They are thick but very irregegular in their shapes.

Colorful stacking game that is easy to teach and a lot of fun! The players stack animals over and around a crocodile on the center of the table. At the start of the turn the player rolls a die to see what they do. Usually they get to place an animal or two, or give someone else an animal to place. If pieces fall they get to keep some. The player who places all their animals first wins. 
The game works very well because there aren't too many rules and the pieces themselves are very well designed to create interesting angles and situations. Excellent children's game that adults can enjoy as well.

The variety of shapes and textures on the animals is what makes this work so well. It's not just "some are round, some are flat" -- pieces are bumpy, spiky, tippy, etc.

I first played the "small but mighty!" version. I like the larger one better in many ways, but the added size and weight of the animals seems to also make the tower more stable, which is less interesting. Am currently in search of good house rules to add challenge.

Definitely not as easy as it seems. Quite a difficult little dexterity game. A bit too hard for my son still, but even for me, I find it challenging to get more than about half the animals stacked before it all comes crashing down. I can see this getting some play in the months ahead.
Still like it. Still find it impossible to get every single animal into one stack.

Great dexterity game with kids. Fun for adults as well. Simple enough rules for the youngest to understand. Pieces are fun for little ones to play with outside of the context of the game as well.

I bought this as a present for my daughter when she was 3.

At the time she found it frustratingly hard trying to balance more than one or two creatures (which made it really difficult for me to throw games convincingly!). A year on and she abolutely loves it.  The rules are simple enough that she can remember them without getting muddled.

Great way to teach very young kids some of the basics of gaming.

Perfect. Incredible. Wow. The more skillful you are, the more risks and impossible placements you'll want to try just to show off or just to be extra mean to the next player. This isn't like usual dexterity games - what a player chooses to do is idiosyncratic.

My three year old daughter shows actual interest in the rules. That is one of the first games that she isn't just playing with. On very rare occasions, she actually beats me, as she has a tendency to disobey the rules of gravity. Amazing.
The rules leave lots and lots of room for interpretation - the only reason to assume that animals have to be aligned with the crocodile (as opposed to a 90 degree angle or other possibilities), for example, comes from the illustrations. Well, I guess anyone can play it as preferred.

This is a great stacking game. Good fun for very young children. Adults who want a light diversion can make one slight modification to the rules (eliminating or reducing the ability to put your animal beside the croc instead of on top) and enjoy themselves.  Adults can play with children and still have fun, perhaps not using moves designed to make the next person's turn more difficult but choosing to place their animals in difficult and hilarious places leaving the easier spots open for the children.

Lots of kids games are more activity than game. This is certainly a game and I think it's a good one for parents to own.  It's also a decent dexterity game for adults, if you don't want to spend the money or the storage space for a Bamboleo or Bausack then this is a good choice.

First played January 30th, 2008. Taught in 1-2 minutes and played in ~10min for 4 players. This has a few elements of luck and strategy, however it's more of a dexterity game. It's a great filler as you stack animal blocks on a crocodile.  Divide out the animals evenly and then roll the dice. Two sides have one pix on it (choose 1 animal to stack), one with two pix (choose two), a picture of a hand (give a piece to someone else to stack), crocodile (place an animal next to the crock), and a ? (other choose what you will stack (by vote). There are for of each of the 7 different animals (besides the one crock). Sheep, Toucan, Hedgehog, Monkey, Penguin, Snake and Gecko. You use one hand to stack and if you knock 1-2 down you take those. If you knock more than two, then pick one to take back into your hand along with the one you were trying to placed and place the rest out of play. The first person with no animals wins. Give this a try if you know someone who has it and give consideration in purchase as it is a great filler.

Sep08:  Now this is just one cute dexterity game!  I enjoyed the nice bits and the simple game play.  If you at all are looking for some stacking fun, then look no further.

I liked how the game had a definite end.  No matter how many pieces you knock off, you only have to take 2 back into your supply.

The die is a little questionable.  I'm not sure how much it adds to the game, but I'll stick with it for now.  I just don't allow more than 2 additional animals on the ground.

One of HABA's enduring games for a reason, this stacking game is fun and relatively fast. Also, unlike something like Jenga, there's some added interaction with the die roll where you might give one of your pieces to another player or decide the most difficult piece for another player to have to place. Finally, I've seen all ages be able to play this simultaneously. True, the parents and grandparents might be more skilled and patient at placing animals on the stack, but the younger players can observe and learn... and the skill differential hasn't been so big as to stop everyone from enjoying. This is a great gateway game for younger kids and a good dexterity game to have in your mix.

This may be a game designed with children in mind, but the simple dexterity challenge of Animal Upon Animal is great for all ages. It's a little unbalanced thanks to starting each turn with a die roll that determines the difficultly (and how much progress) one's turn involves, but it doesn't bother me because the fun of this game is watching (and attempting) the challenge of stacking the animals. I care less about winning this one and more about being impressed by amazing moves and funny outcomes.

Don't let the children's game moniker make one look the other way - this game is truly fun for all ages.

But she still got out the animals to stack 'em when Make 'n Break was put away, and got out the animals again the next morning without prompting. So ... we'll see how this unfolds.

It's amazing how these completely irregular pieces stack together so nicely.  It seems probably a tad difficult for young hands, but I haven't yet tried it with my kids yet, so I can't say.  Maybe their fearless nature (a la Gulo Gulo) will pay off, who knows?  This is a quicker, more colorful and lighthearted alternative to Bausack.

Fun game to play with my 3 year old daughter. I assume it will only get better as her fine motor skills and grasp of the different animal's stacking potential grows...

RATING: 7
This game is a lot of fun. Even with non gamers.

This game is targeted at kids, but adults may play it too. It plays fast and everyone seems to like it. Of course it gets a little repetitive, but I don't think it is supposed to be played for hours, it's a nice filler.

I'm rating this as a game for kids, but really this can be played by adults too for fun.  Chunky wooden pieces, quick gameplay, a big hunk of wood for a custom die, all add up to a quality gift for any family trying to bring the little ones in on the fun.  You'll be surprised at just how many animals you can stack.

[LUP 08-Jul-2007] We picked up the Tier Auf Tier version from Caterpillar Games at the 2006 Australian Games Expo.  Big hit with children and quite popular with adults too.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My rating is based on playing with young children.  

The game's strengths:

1) Takes 15 minutes or less to play.  Most kids have an attention span capable of handling this.
2) The rules are very accessible to young children (4 - 7).  My 6 year old son is able to teach other children how to play.
3) The penalty for knocking the animals over is limited; all will not be lost.  
4) The animals are wooden and light, easy for little fingers to manipulate.
5) It's a dexterity game with wide appeal, so adults and older siblings (9 - 12 year olds) are often willing to play a game or two.

RATING: 7
I like the game in the parents-kids environment, it's fun (also for parents) and interesting. I have never tried playing it with adults only but I can imagine it may be also a lot of fun, since the game is not that easy at later stage, when the stack is pretty high.

How do my kids rate the game? They like it a lot and never refuse to play one game, but it's a notch lower than Gulo Gulo. They definitely love the artwork and the concept of the game, which doesn't make much sense, but it's silly in a good way. I would definitely recommend it to parents of kids of ANY age, but it should be perfectly suited to kids age 3-6. 

The stacking game to try.

LIKES:

* Probably the best Jenga-like game on the market.
* Different types and shapes of animals create a different game each time with different challenges.
* Game is easy to pick up and play and the die randomizer for an action effect adds a lot of interest and variability to the game.  Love rolling those hands where I can give my piece to an opponent to place and the opponent deals with the repercussions! 

DISLIKE:

* Don't really have one.  If you don't like dexterity games, you won't like this one.

A fun little dexterity game, although unusually for the genre, it feels like luck can play quite a big part. With only a few pieces each, a couple of lucky die rolls can cause a big change in the game state. Still, if you this more as a kit than as a game, it's a good purchase. I'm particularly looking forward to playing this with my daughter once she gets a little bit older (about 3).

I like dexterity games in general, but I find this one boring as an adult; my daughter enjoys it more than I do. The animals are cute, though, and it plays quickly.

Re-rated from a 5 to an 8. I've warmed up to this one. It's got a but of light strategy in animal choice and placement, which I like, and moments like choosing which animals to keep after a tumble are fun. I also like that you don't lose by knocking this over, unlike most dexterity games of this type.

This is a fun little dexterity game for kids.  In it you roll a custom 6 sided die, which tells you what you have to do that turn.  The result of the die roll involves stacking a given number of animals onto the growing pile in the middle.  The aforementioned animals are actually very nicely rendered colourful wooden pieces.

RATING: 7
Nice children's stacking game that has some challenge for adults too.
I think it can actually be more fun than Villa Paletti, even for adults.

2-Player Comment:
* Animal Upon Animal works well with two. It's my preferred way to play. Unofficial variant: When crocodile has been extended once from both ends, read crocodile dice result as "1".

RATING: 5.5
This is just a toy for now rather than a game; we're working on sorting the animals and hopefully putting them back in the box. I guess in some sense it's a cooperative game. 

As a game, it doesn't excite me too much, not the kind of thing that I would choose to play unless there were really no prospects of playing anything else. I found the rules rather minimal, leaving too much possibility of the game being decided on a fluke. I was however amused by the apparent level of attention to detail in making the outlines of the different animals be *just so*. To what end, I don't know. Still, looking forward to having this around when the little guy discovers turns.

[Update 4yrs 3mos] We actually played this, with like the rules and everything. He was a good sport about it too, both when he knocked over pieces, and when I rolled "hand" repeatedly. But should he have to be? I think the potential for a bad run of luck (it's not a long game) is too high for a kids' game. And again, as with [gameid=7869], why is die-rolling necessary in a dex game?

The actual rule set for this game is a bit dopey, with the die killing it as a competitive game, but if you simply divide the pieces among players in a draft (ideally also throwing in the pieces from some of its spin-offs) and then play without the die, taking turns placing until someone runs out, this has the makings of a classic dexterity game. Seeing how the various pieces go together (or don't!) keeps this challenging and fun, even for adults. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like stacking games and this is a very good stacking game. Don't let the fact that this is a kid's game turn you away - if you like Bausack and the like, this is an excellent choice for a light, fun, but skill-required game.

The animals are designed in such a way that they work together... most of the time. You can usually find a clever way of getting one more piece on the tall, perilously-teetering stack. There's also some semi-strategy involved, such as when you get to pass one of your pieces to another player and force HIM to add it to the tower.

Unless you demand every game to be a silent brain-burner, I can't see this not being a hit for the 15 to 20 minutes it'll take to play. Recommended!

(Got as an early Father's day gift in 2008 "to be played with the [yet unborn] child when s/he is a bit older")

Plays better with adults than I would've thought but perhaps a little bit too easy for experts. Although sometimes pieces are slippier than they look and cause sudden falls. Wooden animals are super cute.

As a kids game it works like charm. Animals are always fun and stacking them is just hard enough and even scary.

Comment: What a simple yet highly entertaining game. This game really needs booze to be interesting since it's too easy otherwise. It's always fun to see peoples reactions when an experienced player puts a piece in a really awkward place. I'd like to try out some of the other versions, but this is a solid buy.

A fast and silly stacking game. The die piles luck and a take-that element on top. Fun as a short game while waiting for people to arrive or while winding down after longer fare.

With gamers, this variant makes it great: When rolling a 'crocodile', you must rotate the crocodile 90 degrees instead of placing an animal. You may use two hands.

RATING: 7
Lovely little dexterity game with awesome chunky wood pieces. It's as simple as can be, roll a die, place one or more of your animals on the central stack and hope they stay. First player to place all their animals wins. It is certainly aimed at younger kids, and it's not too difficult to stack the animals. Thus, many games come down to the luck of the roll, but honestly, that's what makes the best kids games and luck becomes the great equalizer.

Turning out to be my son's first true game. At 3 1/2 he still doesn't really get it but likes playing with the pieces, rolling the die, learning to take turns and especially enjoys the hell out of watching me build animal towers and then knocking them down.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This game works well with my four-year old.  He is able to keep his focus through at least one, and up to three games in a row.  When he loses focus, he tries to wreck the tower by softly releasing his animal instead of carefully placing it.  The best part of this game is that adults can play with the kids, and they can compete on the same level with the basic rules. The game is fun enough that adults will try to win and enjoy good plays by the kids.

Rating based upon how eager I am to select this for a game with children.

Too much fun!!!

This is one of those games that will be hit or miss for different people. We take it pretty serious and own two sets to allow for some insane games and we also play pretty cutthroat and place our pieces in tricky ways to make it harder on the next player. Although the game is marketed toward children it offers a great dexterity gaming experience and you can house rule or tailor the game any way you like to make it easier or more difficult.

What an amazing kids game! Everyone's having fun with this one - young and old alike. It's a simple dexterity game in the vein of, say, "Jenga", but with cute components and several interesting twists. Building a pyramid of animals has never been that much fun.

And believe me, with experienced players it can really turn cutthroat. You'll often risk a lot just to put the next player in an uncomfortable position, but that's exactly in the spirit of the game. A great little filler to end any gaming party. And do I have to say it shines even more after a few shots?

My daughter really likes this, despite getting overly nervous when there's a large pyramid of animals in front of her. I'm not really into dexterity stacking games, but this one is mercifully short and I'm usually ready to give it a go. The dice really adds an element of unpredictability, and the game looks great.

This deserves a very high rating. It's incredibly accessible and a lot of fun. I like how, as you get more confident, you start to create 'collapsable' traps for your opponents.

Some might see this game as little different to Kerplunk, Jenga etc. But I think it's easily a big notch above those - both because of the technique that you develop and also the satisfyingly direct way that you try to make things difficult for each other. You have more options than in Jenga etc, and more satisfying ways to put your opponents in sticky situations.

Jogo que não é tão original como tentam fazer passar, sendo que tem um lagarto que poucos percebem que se trata de um lagarto e ovelhas que são muito maiores que todos os outros e que não combinam muito bem com o ambiente selvagem dos restantes...

Jenga with cute wooden animals. I can see how stacking animals ontop of each other until the tower collapses could appeal to a certain age range, but there are better dexterity based building games than this one.

Good kids game that's very cute with the little animal shapes providing interesting stacking opportunities. It plays quickly, there's lots of doubting amongst fellow players that another piece can be placed - more often wrong than not. Better than Villa Paletti in my humble opinion - it plays faster and a falling stack of animals is expected and happens now and again during the course of the game.

I've only played with adults, but we've had a lot of fun.  I think kids will definitely enjoy this one too.  It's a basic stacking game with a  die to randomize your turns a bit. Some of the actions might be a problem for some children (specifically when you get to choose their piece or when you get to give them a piece - some kids will see this as you picking on them), but by and large this is a great game and equally fun for kids and adults.

Calling the freaky wooden animals "cute" in the game description is kinda stretching it...

Balance animals on top of each other. If it collapses, collect all but 2 pieces (with the rest removed from game, so it doesn't take forever). Brainless fun, good end-of-night filler. Some ribald humor when you find that the only way to put your next animal on is to put it in a compromising position... 

Those pieces still look hideous.

Seemed a little too easy in my only play. Somebody's going to make it fall eventually, and seems like that person is out of the game once it happens, since the structure will probably only fall once.

Animal upon Animal -- Played once; four-player.

Great bits.  I expected to like this more than I did.  It was fun, but the Crocodile was rolled so many times that there wasn't enough challenge.  I think combining two sets would improve the chances for a bigger, more precarious structure.  Which, of course, would mean more fun!

Oh my, is this fun. I've picked this up as I play with teenagers frequently, but for them it's probably too childish. I've play this with tired friends, with my GF late at night and it's just this silly fun, that keeps me happy and smiling when I play this. A lot of this is about the cutesy visual, but there's the game as well. Of all the stacking games so far (ok, I've played Jenga) this one is really creative - you can play nice, you can play dirty, you can play daring or just crazy. It mostly about good spacial skills and some strategy as well. 

I can see people not liking the dice, which can make all the difference in winning and losing - but if you play this to win, you're in a wrong place. Go pick up boxing gloves and beat somebody up. 

For anybody who thinks this is just a mindless kids game, go read this: [thread=721198][/thread]

Gorgeous looking animal bits that are designed so well that they fit together in many different permutations!

A die is rolled to determine certain options 1) how many animals you have to stack (1-2), make a player stack an animal, let other players decide what animal you stack and place an animal to expand the stacking base.

It works well with adults and kids alike and isn't as easy as it looks. It would be great if the pieces were double in size!

It's adorable to stack animals!  

I rather love this game.  The game play is very straightforward, roll the die, take an action accordingly, sometimes you are lucky, sometimes you aren't.  The fun comes in to stacking the crazy shapes leaving a precarious situation for others.  Really this isn't much more than a classic stacking game, but it works, and it works well.

After both ends of the alligator have animals on it, you should consider the alligator rollss as a one pip.  Otherwise the tension is diffused.

Tier auf Tier is a really fun quick stacking game for all ages.  I've played this one as a light 10-minute filler when playing games and it has always gone over well.  With adults, there is plenty of opportunity to make off-color comments when stacking one animal atop another in an "awkward" position.  And the pieces are very attractive, as they usually are with HABA games.

Fun! And the bits are big enough for a four year old, but still a little tricky for them. This has now bypassed CooCoo as my favorite dexterity game. With a limit of one additional animal stacked next to the alligator per player, the game always gets "dangerous" and because you never take back more than two animals when you make it topple, the game will end in a reasonable amount of time.

RATING: 6
This is a kids game.  Some would say it is family weight but I certainly view it as "sub-family weight".  It is perfectly enjoyable for adults to play, but accessibility level is definitely for children of very young ages.

The game is super simple, each player has a collection of wooden animals and in the center is a wooden alligator.  On a player's turn they roll a die.  The possible rolls are 'place one piece', 'place two pieces', 'give a piece to an opponent to place', 'extend the alligator by placing a piece next to it', and 'place a piece of the opponent's choosing'.

If the stack falls a player has to take two pieces back, otherwise the first to place all their pieces wins.

I don't have kids myself but this would make a great game for parents to play with their children.  It is accessible to anyone and there is no advantage gained with age (if anything, their tiny hands gives kids the advantage).  Even with just adults as a filler or mindless background game it is nice.  Not engaging enough to want to play with just adults very often but still fun nonetheless.

An incredible hit with our almost 4 year old. She wanted to play again and again and we were shocked that she was actually quite good.

Describing all the dice faces was a bit much for her, but we just helped her on her rolls and explained what she got during the game as well, which quickly despersed her innitial fear of not understanding the game :-) 

A great little dexterity exercise for the little ones and a game with many exciting momemts even for the adults.

Etta, enjoys stacking the pieces in this game in a self directed fashion and has safely done so since 1 1/2. She constantly has it off the game shelf and will even pull it out when I am reading the rules to another game. if I logged the number of "plays" as the number of times it has been played with, it would be in the hundreds. This is actually our second copy first given as a spontaneous gift.

Brilliant animal-stacking dexterity fun. Easier than some similar games (e.g. Bausack) but far cuter and there are no regular pieces at all. The die adds some uncertainty -- cruel attempts at setting up the next player for failure may backfire.

The main negative is that there's a bit of a left-right binding problem; you don't want to be to the left of the bastard laying horrible traps, and you [i]do[/i] want to be to the left of the clumsy one who keeps falling for them. The die does mitigate that, however, even as it lets some players repeatedly dodge bullets.

(I imagine it works with children too, but the best time [i]I[/i] had with it was at the pub. Got some odd looks, but great fun.)

[HABA 2005 edition] {Animal; dexterity, dice-rolling; scalable}  Animal over Animal is a cute game for kids and adults.  It isn't difficult to stack the animal and it isn't too long to be boring.  And, it's quite luck driven, as a player can theoretically give away all animals without stacking one :P

The wooden animal pawns are cute.  My 3-yr old daughter like them very much.

Bought this from Australian Games Expo in Canberra when Cynthia reminded me that I should buy something "for the kids". :-p This is a good game though, and I wish we pull this out more often. The only thing I don't like is the dice-roll result that instruct you to give a piece of your own to another player to place. To me, that detracts from the enjoyment of the game; I enjoy trying to stack my animals on the crocodile, not watch someone else do it!

Great game for little ones. Well balanced. The shapes fit together in fun and unusual ways. The rules are not too harsh (dump the pile and only take 2 back the rest go in the box), so it encourages creativity.

My only fault is that it would be nicer to have both sides painted with faces, etc. since we see both sides.

Absolutely fabulous filler. Goes with any number of players, and for anyone regardless of background. Although it's a dexteritygame it's a rather pleasant and easy one, so shaky hands don't mean immediate disaster. I expect this game to be at the very top of my played games list. (18 Dec 08 after 10 plays)

2 months and 25 more plays later, still stays at a full 10. (13 Feb 09)

72 plays and a perfect ten (6 Feb 11).

Dexterity games are often a great way to get non-gamers or kids into games and I am always looking for them. Often times the best ones are expensive and are not portable. Which is kind of a bummer because they are impractical. Animal Upon Animal is the perfect solution. It also scales nicely from 2-4 which is can also be somewhat rare for dexterity games.

Great game for kids and adults.  I have played this with 6 different groups of people (some with kids, some just adults) and have always had a good time.

Quick and fun and works with nearly all ages.  A perfect game for any collection. 


Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 4
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 5
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 4.25

[thing=17329][/thing] is a dexterity game indicated mainly for the little ones, but I played with grown ups and everyone enjoyed it quite a bit. Well, of course dexterity games tend to be fun - who here wasn't picked on in gym class for lack of dexterity it sometimes?

In [thing=17329][/thing] the aim is to get rid of all your animals sooner than the others players. You must put an animal above the others - if none of them fell off, you are good to go. If any animal fall from the "formation", you must take them.

You begin your turn by rolling a die and do what it says you must do:

- Put one piece you have in the formation;
- Put two piece you have in the formation;
- Pick someone else to put the animal for you (if any of the pieces fall, the person you choose takes it/them);
- The others choose which piece you must place;
- You must put a piece on one of the sides of the pile.

Of course the animals are different among themselves. Some are usually easier to put in the formation (like the serpent or the hedgehog) and others are a little trickier (the tucan and the penguin).

The fun comes from watching the others struggle to put an animal in the formation, and when you try to add one, all trembling fingers while the others cheerfully chant for you to mess up.

Good game, for kids and adults (as a warm-up).

Generally better with more players (the stack gets bigger faster, so there are more topples).  Also better when there are fewer crocodiles rolled, but it's short enough to forgive it.  For adults or older children some kind of tweak on the crocodile mechanic would be recommended.

Nice little dexterity game for all ages (although playing with people of about equal skill makes it slightly more interesting). The die makes some games more tense than others, but even if things become to easy, the relatively short playing time ensures that it does not drag on. When the die makes it hard (hardly any crocodile results), the game is at its best and can be enjoyed by children and adults alike. The game also has good quality components - the different shapes of the animals are very well thought out.
UPDATE: The more I play it, the more I like it. And the more I play other dexterity games, the more I appreciate the quality of Tier Auf Tier. Brought this to a party and it was a great succes!

Mainly for kids but also a quick fun dexterity game.  Kids love animals and stacking them so they don't or do fall over is a scream for them.

Update: To say that I previously owned this technically wrong.  I know where it is.  It's behind my TV where my then 2 year old thought that putting the pieces in the hole in the wall that Daddy just made for a TV outlet would be hilarious.  Turns out he was right, I probably won't tell him
We will purchase again someday! :)

Insanely cute stacking game. Everyone from small children to adults seem to like it based on my experience. The thing is this game isn't much about the stack falling down, you can usually build a pretty awesome tower that seems quite impossible. I generally am not a fan of randomness, but the die works well to create more variety too.

We houserule it so that all animals must face the same direction, this make the painted side look more cute and makes the game just a tad harder. I bought some other wooden animals I could find and they work absolutely fine with the original set.

Rule change: only a maximum of 2 animals can be placed adjacent to the croc (one on each side) and on future turns you just have to add an animal to the stack when this options gets roled. This makes for a much tenser game and a much more interesting experience for older kids or adults.

This reminds me of Zoowaboo but it's more challenging in that you have to have a steady hand and the balancing act gets more difficult as the game progresses, while Zoowaboo stays pretty stagnant and doesn't have the same variability in terms of game play as this game. Also, I like the incorporation of a die, it makes the game a lot of fun by introducing that element of randomness and by allowing other players to control your turn sometimes. This is a great game, very easy to understand and just stimulating enough to play as both a fun and challenging game. I like it just a smudge more than Zoowaboo, it's definitely a favorite, for sure. Great times are had.

I've given in and rated Tier auf Tier a 10! The game simply is that much fun. It looks great, with cute, sturdy wooden animal components and it plays exquisitely  well.

Tier auf Tier is a dexterity game where your job is to stack your seven animals on top of the large crocodile before any other player manages the same, all without toppling the animal pyramid.

The game has a lot of different variations available, and all of them can be combined to give you a huge variety of animals to chose from when playing. We have different 23 animals in our collection, and enjoy playing our huge variant where each player starts with one each of said 23 animals.

Tier auf Tier has gone from an initial 7 rating all the way up to a 10, where it will stay for the foreseeable future. I highly recommend this to any fan of dexterity games, and it makes a great gift for families, whether they're into hobby games or not. Please give it a try if you get the chance.

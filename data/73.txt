RATING: 7
Solid theme, very scalable game (2-6), that involves luck of the draw (cards), but also opportunities for strategy (where/when to open your show, to clear or not to clear the board, how much money to borrow, take this card now or later).  A good combination of fun and tension.  An essentially language independent game that's difficult to find, but worth the purchase.

A nice light game about producing various shows.  It is basically a set collection game, but has a nice theme and scoring mechanisms that raise it above a basic card game.  It is highly dependant on luck of the draw, but provides sufficient methods to handle 'non-useful cards'.  Thematically, it works better than the rethemed Atlantic Star version.  [GTI Code: TGCL]

Simple drafting game. You need to fulfill certain shows, and can take the free actor, or pay more to skip (or get a new set of applicants). While everyone has the same goals, the order they work on them matters. A game of efficiency.

Suppose to be a good 6-player game.  Seems to be on the very light side of the strategic scale.  It is a card-game, which is a plus.

With RFTG and Dominion possibly offering 6 player expansions later on, I don't think I'll need this game anymore to fulfill the 6p game niche.  Additionally, this game is so rare that it will cost a lot to get.

I've played games with 2, 3 and 6 people, so none with "ghost" players.  A very good light game that seems too simple at first, but grows in complexity as you begin to understand the importance of your finances.   Judging between a 6 power for $3000 or a 3 power for free is the key to this game in our estimation.

I expected this game to be a hit with my family because the rules are so simple, and it has a relatively short playtime. So, what went wrong? I didn't hate the game, it was not bad, but I failed to find the love that many others have expressed for this game. The family (particularly the ladies) seemed frustrated with the restrictions of hand-size. It appears to limit your options and discourage thinking on your toes and adapting strategy. I must admit there was also a significant luck-of-the-draw factor, as the actors I needed repeatedly fell into my lap without much difficulty, and others struggled to even find an amateur in order to avoid a miscast. The goofy names of the actors was entertaining at times, and I was intrigued by the strategy of knowing when and how much to borrow against completed shows. That almost added a push-your-luck element as you could risk borrowing a lot with hopes that the remaining directors wouldn't slide in with a better show. Sadly the game just didn't work for us, though. The most common complaint was the fact that we could have a similar experience by playing Hollywood Blockbuster, and yet the auctions and closed economy add so much more interest. This one worked its way onto my trade pile very quickly, because whenever I feel the urge to play it, I'll just grab Hollywood Blockbuster instead.

Excellent card-drafting & hand management game.  Very tense moments as you run low on cash for clearing the crappy cards.  Also tense when deciding how much money to take out for loans... and hoping that you don't get locked out of taking a loan.  The broadway show theme is much better than the remake called Atlantic Star which has players making cruise ship itineraries.

Note: I want the new 2011 version.  The variant (red/blue hearts & flower symbols on the cards) will add a new dimension (more challenge & strategy) to the game.

Didn't do much for me on the first playing, but grew on me with repeated play. Not much on player interaction, but lots of interesting juggling to get your shows produced. Sort of in the same mould as Alan Moon games such as Union Pacific or Reibach (or Dirk Henn's Stimmt So!), and while certainly not in the same league as Union Pacific, it still has a lot more interesting choices than the other games. Crucially, also works quite well with 6, which is a relative rarity.

The Atlantic Star re-issue is nice but not as thematically well-grounded as the original Showmanager.

Game in which players assemble casts of stars and hacks to perform various plays.

RATING: 6
Solid gateway title, with a complexity that is only a hair greater than Ticket to Ride. In fact, both games are somewhat similar in the sense that both present an array of cards that players draft from the options.

The pluses for Show Manager are that the theme is actually fairly clever. And, I like how players can borrow against their shows, which creates the choice between cash and flexibility vs. high enough rankings to score points. Overall a good title, and the fact that it's supposed to play best with six players is a perk.

Update: well, that didn't last long. Two plays and I started to seriously think about trading this one. I eventually sold it in an auction. It's a decent game, but one I don't need to own. I have plenty of options for lightweight family games, and although I like the theme, the game play doesn't have as much tension as, say, Ticket to Ride or some others in my collection.

RATING: 5.25
A somewhat more complex variation on the standard set collection game, you draw cards to try and cast a show.  Certain actors are better suited to roles and earn more points.  But to get more cash you may have to borrow against an already-produced show.

While this isn't a terrible game, as soon as I was done I thought, "I'd rather just play Hollywood Blockbuster."  The latter adds the excitement of auctions which negates some of the luck element, and you have a place to use unwanted tiles.  So Show Manager just isn't a game I need to play again.

Production: Each of the many actors has a unique portrait, name, and combination of acting abilities.  The cards are a bit busy, but they do a good job of conveying what could have seemed dryly statistical.  Play: I enjoy the mechanic of actors becoming cheaper the longer they're looking for work; the method by which victory points are awarded to the best producers of each type of show; and the fact that different cards are appealing to different players at different times.  (2+1+3) (2 plays)

The rules for the 2011 edition are identical to those for Atlantic Star (Both games now permit you to keep 2 cards following a show/voyage.), but I'm not sure the card distributions match. The Show Manager theme certainly makes more sense. Pull this one out when you have six players who do not want to break into smaller groups. The 6-player version may have less down time than any other such Euro, although six-player Medici and Ave Caesar also are quick.

Played twice now.  I like the game, but there seems to be a bit too much luck in the card draw/redraws. If you can luck into the right draws, you are set.  Maybe it works better w/fewer people (we played w/6).

Update, definitely a lot of luck in this game.  But it's not really a bad thing.  Kind of like in Thebes with the tile draws.  It's part of the game.  After several plays, I feel that my initial rating of "6" is about right for it.

RATING: 7
Players are producers trying to stage four different shows.  The actors for the shows, of varying abilities, are drafted into a players hand.  When there are enough actors, it&#039;s off to Broadway.  This game never fails to generate some laughs and is a firm fixture in my collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is the classic hand-management game of pushing your luck. You have a limited number of cards you can hold, so there is a great tension like in Lost Cities. There is a push-your-luck element as you hope that beneficial actors will come up for bid. And a tight money-management aspect of settling for the cheap actors and borrowing versus your completed shows. It is one of the best, first, and fastest games to feature an interesting drafting mechanic and the game holds up very well to this day. I consider it a classic.

Over the years I've hemmed and hawed over which edition is preferred, and the 2011 Broadway version makes all that irrelevant. It's functional and fun and findable!

Normally I don't have a problem with random card draws, but like New York 1901, there just needs to be a better way to grab the cards you want instead of just watching  as someone else either wipes it off the tableau or picks it up.

Other than that, it's a great theme and if you get into it when "putting on your show", it's a lot of fun.  Mechanically, I'm not so sure what everyone is so gaga about, but different strokes for different folks.

One of my absolute favourites, the choices are terribly simple, but the balance in the game lies in the management of your cash. You can take money once out of each show, but that devalues the show and hence your scoring. Do you compete for the best show, or try to be average overall. And watching that 9 singer disappear just before your turn is so frustrating. Oh this game couldn't be better! Now re-issued with slight tweaks as Atlantic Star by Queen.

Same game as Atlantic Star in a different packaging (or vice versa). A light set collection game with a bit of push-your-luck and requiring some risk management. Luck at the card draw can play a significant role but hopefully somewhat evens out over the course of a game. Solid game with pretty simple rules.

This is a great little game that always illicits a hearty laugh or two from everyone who plays it. A nice, relatively quick filler where you don't have to use too much grey matter, but it still affords an opportunity for strategic play. The theme is great, and this game is a lot of fun.

There is a lot of luck in Showmanager and very often no way to mitigate bad luck.  For instance, when you've collected 3-5 cards for the plays with larger casts and the person to your right starts collecting the same play, there is nothing you can hope to do except get lucky with card flips (regular or clearing the docket). This is because you can't collect more than two extra cards at a time, which means once committed to a play you can't change your mind based on the play of others.  This can be a frustrating experience if the player before you ends up collecting the same productions right after you've gone "all in".

Also, players who choose small plays early on basically decide what each play is worth by picking the cities.  Even choosing a small play at the start doesn't guarantee you'll choose where that city will go; card flips and turn order can give another play that luxury.

Since the information in the game is potentially trackable, but the drawn cards are then hidden, the player with the best memory has an advantage.  You can make some inferences of what each opponent is collecting based on the size of their hand, but only if they're splaying their cards in sight.  But then the advantage may be slight, since luck seems to play a much larger role.

While this game isn't exactly Candy Land with some Memory thrown in, I'm still not sure the game has enough control and decisions for an hour+ game.

Showmanager is a nice set collecting game about casting Broadway-style shows. It's somewhat fluffy, but does force you to weigh some nasty tradeoffs. You have to pay to hire actors, and money is very tight. You sometimes need to mortgage previous shows (slashing their value) in order to raise capital. Actors waiting to be hired line up in a queue, with prices ranging from free to quite expensive. The longer they go without work, the cheaper they become to hire. Most of the actors know more than one role, although they'll be better at some than others. The challenge is to assemble a good cast for your current show without taking on too much chaff, since you're only allowed to save two actors in your hand for future shows. You might decide to pluck a star actor for the show you plan to produce after the current one, but you have to be careful because of the hand limit.

I strongly prefer Showmanager to Atlantic Star; the theme of Showmanager is more fun, and is a much better fit with the game's systems.  Also, the thinner deck of Showmanager creates more tension.  Many gamers view Showmanager as a game for 6 players because it moves quickly and generally does a better job than most games of accommodating that number.  It is pretty good with 6, but I actually think it's a whole lot better with just 3 players.  With 3, each player puts on each show twice.  You don't have to use dummy shows like you do with 2, 4, or 5 players.  Your turn comes around much more often than it does with 5-6 players, obviously, which means less boring dead time and more control over the proceedings.  Defensive plays become viable choices.  And I find that the decisions about hiring, timing, and borrowing money become much more difficult.

This thing has some of the most hideous art I've seen in many a year. We laughed in astonishment with every card turned, each picture impossibly more awful than the last. The play itself didn't do much for me either-- lots of card drawing and not much else.

Showmanager is an older set collection game with a sense of humor, and an interesting twist for income.

The game consists of players trying to cast a set of 5 shows in various cities, and create the best overall productions.

To accomplish this, they need to recruit the best possible actors for the open roles, so shows can be produced. This takes money.

Money is a very limited resource in this game, and beyond the humor of filling roles with more (or less) suitable actors, the crux of the game is: how much money do you pull out of successful productions in order to fund other productions.

Money is the VP- so hiring actors eventually means sacrificing VP towards earning greater VP by game end.

That is the twist, and what makes the game satisfying.

Showmanager is a set collection game to make best show programs on broadway. There are four shows in the game. The reputation of the shows is determined by actors and actress. Every actor and actress is specialized in certain show programs. The game is very witty while finding performers. Production cost and budget of players are very limited. The management of card limit is also very tough. However, the game rule is simple and easy. Showmanager is one of the best party game.

Not sure yet from just one play if Show Manager will hold up a second time. Seeing the cards for the first time, we all made jokes about who they resembled, and made a big deal when we cleared the board of actors, or revealed the cast for a newly-opening play. It was a lot of fun in that regard. As for the game itself, I'd be curious to try again and see if I could manage my money a different way, making the most out of each cast, instead of filling each letter the first chance I got.

Very decent game.  Plays nicely and smoothly.

I don't see a serious problem with randomness (as many people claim here, on bgg).  Yeah, the luck might give, at times, a needed card to one player or another(sometimes cheap or even for free), but it's not a big deal here.

The only (potential) problem I can see are very similar scores of players at the end.  It seems it's enough to play without significant errors and follow whatever path and you should be fine at the end, possibly winning or being very close to it.

I'm willing to play more to test the game more thoroughly.

RATING: 7
This is a good hand management/set collection game even though I feel like options are always limited making it feel like hand management hell, it forces you to do the best with what you have. Some good strategy in this but a good dose of luck also. Reminded me a little of Modern Art and Traumfabrik in some ways, especially how certain shows were worth more as were certain cities. The fun part of the game is when you have some money to burn and you really need some cards, then you can waste a pile of it clearing the board pissing everyone else off and amazing them at the same time...

Almost exactly the same game as Atlantic Star.  I had heard that Showmanager was better than AS due to the theme and so I went out of my way to trade AS and get Showmanager but I was disappointed that the theme really made it no better.  Besides that, it's a good game but get either version, it doesn't really matter.

I know it might be blasphemous, but I'm not sure if I like this better than Atlantic Star.  I like Showmanager's theme better, but I prefer the artwork of Atlantic Star for some reason.  The game feels exactly the same, but not having done a detailed comparison, I'll say that they play pretty much the same.  I could go either way, but right now they're both enjoyable light games that last just about the right amount of time.  A good amount of luck, some fun money management - what more can you want?

Based on one play; a five-player game.  Now that I know how this works I'm ready to play this again to give it another try.  A fun game I suppose but didn't bowl me over.  I think I'd prefer the re-themed Atlantic Star.  You're pretty much stuck pursuing just one show at a time due to the limit of no more than two cards remaining in your hand after producing a show.  And it's frustrating trying to gather the cards you need before someone else takes them or clears them all off the board.

I enjoy this... but in a painful kind of way.  Lots of frustration in not getting actors/cards you covet and since we're all sharing the same problem, it's painfully amusing in a communal sort of way.

I still can't explain why I like it although I think it shines best with six players...

RATING: 7
Fascinating game seeking to find a balance between making high number sets for different shows and figuring out where one might get the most points at the end of game based on city and value of show in a city.  Very easy to teach and everyone enjoyed the game immensely.  Also, playing with the variants makes the game better (i.e. paying 2DM to replace all 4 cards available AND allowing people to borrow against a played show reducing its value but giving the player more cash to use).  Thematically, this game seems to pull me in more than the very similar Atlantic Star, but there is no need to have both games unless you are collecting Dirk Henn games.

Very nice, very simple, nice decisions. Could easily have won an SDJ. Quick and thoughtful, probably better with less players - the high chaos factor with more players doesn't thrill me.

The theme works! but not so strongly... I don't feel that I'm putting on a show *that much* (but some). In real life I doubt a given city would really want only 1 single show performed by 4 different companies....

Bits are just okay. I don't like the art, and the strange write-on-the-chits thing is bizarre (they really do wipe off). It works.

When I first read the rules I was troubled that the player who plays all their shows is basically removed from the game. This doesn't seem to be a problem though as turns are quick and you are probably not out of the game for more than 2 turns anyway. 

Pretty simple game with the option to add a little complexity. I'm not sure it has that much room for complexity though as the game is already pretty tight as it is.

There are a few ways you can go about putting on your shows and you can make a go of it without taking out money from them as long as you are confident enough in your first shows that having your last shows be complete disasters is OK.

Just copying my Atlantic Star comment since I couldn't tell the difference: The gameplay is fast and easy to learn yet the decisions are thought-provoking and sometimes painful. It's a fun set collection game and I found myself mainly concerned with my own sets. Repeat plays will show that there's quite a bit you can do to effect your opponents' choices. Money is tight and I really enjoy the borrowing mechanism, which ultimately effects your standings on the points board.

less accessible than you would think as with an experienced gamer, the gameplay can turn nasty pretty quick.  playing aggressive and wiping the board as a defensive strategy is often a good play balanced by the tight economic system where spending that $2k can be tough.

A great six player game.  My wife and daughter love it.  Plenty of luck, but it does emphasize careful card management.  Warning: make sure you discard (remove from play) cards after they are used to produce a play.  We mistakingly put them on the discard pile to be reshuffled back in.  The game is much better when the top actors are only used once!

This is a fun, simple, game that leaves players fighting over positioning themselves to build the best musical shows. Even with the simple rules, it's challenging to choose which show to attempt with the hand size limit, which card to take, how to balance money, and if and when to take a loan. This largely depends on other players. It's an enjoyable game.

It's nice that you can play (and enjoy) this game with its full range of 2-6 players. I prefer it with 2 or 3, though, as having more than one show of each type seems to add a little more strategy. It's definitely on the lighter side of the gaming spectrum, but the players have enough influence on things for the cream to rise to the crop - something many lighter games totally lack.

It's been a long time between plays, and I still find the game alittle frustrating. Having to memorise fractured values and letter types to make the effective decision, the narrowing choice of which show to declare, to then have a desired card taken or scrapped before your eyes hurts alittle. I find Circus Flochati plays similarly with more streamlining, system inflicted humour in half the time.

Show Manager is a neat hand-management/set-collection card game that I'd happily own if the Queen edition wasn't going to have far too big a box and over-produced components for a game of this weight. The tension comes from only being able to hold two cards more than you need for the show you're trying to put on - you can't just discard the excess ones so you have to be very careful about what you pick up.

I loved dbSpiele's Premier and was ecstatic when a mass market version came out.  This game has all the right elements: scarce resources, gambling by wiping out the board (we call it 'pulling the slot machine'), competition for commodities (the actors) without a cut-throat element to it, and even tanking your own project for the advancement of another.  Best of all, you don't have to look at the board too much during the short time between your turns (as it could well change).  Like Alhambra, that's a great asset in this fun little game.

A set collection game where the theme is producing shows. Players hire actors from a marketplace, where how long an actor has been unhired dictates his or her price. They must respect a hand-size (troupe?) limit. When ready to produce a play, cards are played and the points scored are largely dependent on how appropriate each actor is for the role he or she has been cast in. Some players have been typecast in a particlar role and will score huge points for it (while scoring no points for other roles) while others are more flexible and will do OK in various roles. An interesting theme overlaid on a fairly simple set of mechanics. Played with both suggested variants.

Light and quick.  Thematic in the sense that the rules are easy to explain using the theme; however, playing the game doesn't really immerse you into the world of showbusiness.  Not very many decisions to make.  You have a very limited window to decide which show you want to produce, after which you are locked into your decision for several turns.  A 'good' actor is only good for one particular role, despite the fact that three possible roles he/she can play.  On the plus side, this makes the game run quickly.I can take it or leave it at this point (after one play).  Lots of luck, fast to play.  Feels like a pasttime rather than something that actively engages me.  Don't have much of an emotional response to it yet, but willing to try again, as I did little with the loans (it appears to be a big source of tension in the game, and I managed to go without any).

I was able to snag a used copy of this very rare game.  I paid a fortune for it, but I'm glad to have it.  Same theme as "Traumfabrik," but completely different mechanics; and I like these better.  You try to cast four plays with the best actor cards.  But there's a strict hand limit, so you may find yourself having to cast a show with the wrong actors and losing points for it.  You can (and probably have to) borrow money against your already-finished plays by lowering their scores, so the running score is very dynamic throughout the game, all the way until the end.

Show Manager -- Played once; three-player.

Strictly speaking, this was our first time playing Show Manager, but since we have all played Atlantic Star, we were familiar with the mechanics. Still, the three-player version plays very differently, since we each played two productions of each show, rather than one. 

Odd that three-player is longer than four-player (See below), but it was involving throughout.

• 3 players times 2 productions times 4 shows = 24 productions
• 4 players times 1 production times 4 shows = 16 productions
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played this so far with 2, 3 and 4 players. Show Manager is a simple set collection game with two distinctive features. If you are the first player to stage a particular show, you can choose which city to premiere it in – your choice reflects your confidence in the production. The second interesting feature is the ability to borrow against your productions to generate cash, at the cost of reducing the value of that particular production.

However, there is a lot of randomness involved in the actors available for hire, which is exacerbated by the limited cash each player has. The game also plays out a little longer than it should and the new Queen Games version is packaged in a box mostly full of air. Show Manager may have a few clever mechanisms and some brilliant moments when everything clicks together, but it is also very prone to frustrating moments of randomness which can render careful hand management futile.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Own db Spiele version. Probably has a better theme and more 'fun' graphics as compared with Atlantic Star. The game is essentially one of hand and risk management. Players draft cast for 4 different shows and the highest-quality shows gain more VPs. The game is made hard because of a strict hand limit (players can't draft more than 2 cards beyond the requirements of a show).

The game scales well up to six and that alone makes it worth the price of admission,

A very fun set collection game.  Frustrating in a good way.  The "loan" mechanism is quite cool and adds a great deal of strategy.  Works well with six people (which is unusual in a Euro), although the ideal number is 4 or 5.

RATING: 7.5
This is certainly one of the "classic" early Euros.  It is drafting galore, with tons of tough small decisions that add up to what feels like big sweeping events.  The art, while whimsical, is kind of irritating.  I find that the icons and the loan tiles a little rough to read.  All in all the artistic sensibility is lacking (Made vastly superior with Atlantic Star, despite the poorer theme).  It has a great theme and really heats up as people's goals bump into each other.

I was surprised I liked Show Manager as much as I did.  The gameplay itself was simple to learn and pick up.  I intuited most of the rules by looking at the components.  It's a set collection and hand management game with some tension in the card draw and the restrictions imposed by the [i]de facto[/i] hand limit.  It's certainly not a game I have any desire to own, and I can imagine the luck of the draw bugging me over the long term, but in my one play I enjoyed it.  Not coincidentally, perhaps, I won by a very large margin.

This is a fun set-collection card drafting game ... one of the earliest ones out there! And a fun theme!

Players are drafting actors from a card row (free-0-1-2-3) building sets of cards, ideally all in one color. Cards are actors, each with a particular specialty (A-F). There are 4 possible shows (colors), each with 3/4/5/6 actors. The show requires actors for roles A-C/D/E/F. There are also a few jokers that can fill any role. Once you have at most x+2 cards, put on a show using x cards. The first player to put on a show of a color selects a city -- all shows of that color must then also be played in that city. Cities differ from each other in the VP values available for shows. When you put on a show, add the value of those cards and write on your tile; place in the city, in rank order of value (ties go to earlier placed).

There are a few other little nuances, too:
- you can, at the START of your turn, reduce the value of one of your shows by up to $10 to take that much cash (max once/show). Money is tight, so you'll almost certainly need to do this at least once!
- you can pay $2 to flush the display, repeatedly if you like! Gotta find a key card sometimes!
- the city VP awards vary in max value and spread; some, therefore, are better to place the shows you plan to borrow against (so you don't lose as many VP)
- the tricky rule about having no more than 2 cards in hand when playing a show (or one at game end) is fun ... really limits your options after you start building your set!

At the end of the game (after everyone has played all their shows), sum the VP values of your shows in each of the cities; highest sum wins!

Simple rules, tense play -- quite fun!

[Queen Games 'Showmanager' 97 edition] {Celebrity, economic, gateway; set collection, drafting; optimal 4-6p} Showmanager is a thematic set-collecting game. It lasts for around an hour. It's quite fast-paced and each turn is usually short; therefore, there is not much down time even if 6p are involved.

The rules are simple and can be taught in 4 minutes. I especially like the rule that a player has to sacrifice the value of a drama in order to maintain cash flow. Competition of resources is low in Showmanager because there are many cards available and there are not attacking cards. The major competition appears at the positions of a site. Players have to decide which site to take or leave. They may deliberately use one site to maintain cash flow and try to secure better position in other sites. Therefore, choosing which site to play for the first show is important and strategic. Nevertheless, it is not taxing to make decisions in this game.

Luck is quite important in Showmanager though players could use money wisely to control the luck. It a clever design that players have to make loan before shuffling the card, which forces players to plan better. In a 6p game, the four cards are usually shuffled before your turn. Therefore, a player usually has to pay to shuffle the card when he is near to complete a collection. Therefore, maintaining cash flow is more important in 5-6p game. Another clever design is that a player can't make loan when a play is completely shown in a site. This prevents players from intentionally delaying making loan until the very end to secure his position in a site; thus, players have to plan better.

The cards are cute but I don't like the design that you have to write on the tiles.  Even though the writing can be erased, it's easy to leave marks on the tiles. Although it's printed in German, the texts on the cards will not affect the play. Nevertheless, a player aid can be provided so that players can recall the turn sequence more easily.

In all, it is a very good family game. It's a pity that it's OOP. I like this theme more than Atlantic Star.

Milyen érdekes, hogy mennyit számít egy nagyobb lélegzetvételű partijátéknál a külső. A játék pont ugyanaz, mint az Atlantic Star, az mégis kedvenc lett, ez pedig hajmeresztően rosszá válik a gagyi grafika és a tematika miatt.

More fun that it has any right to be. The production quality (in the 1990-something original) looks distinctly home made, but the game works relatively well. I'm pretty sure it is massively swingy depending on the order in which cards come out and in a 5/6 player game it is so chaotic with cards being 'flushed' so often there is basically no point in even watching what is going on until the person before you starts their turn, but the decisions as to what shows to work towards and which to borrow money against really make the game and (the latter especially) are wonderful.

RATING: 5
It's a very restrictive hand management type game, where you try to cycle very carefully through the deck a few times to get the exact card you need at the exact right time.  It's okay, but I'm not sure it deserves all the hype it gets.

As far as player number, I think it's best with 6 because there are no 'dummy' players, but that also just makes all the actors tighter and the competition for those actors.

In the end, it's fun to play, but it's not a super experience or anything.

Showmanager is one of those surprisingly fun games, which is a very good thing.  The money-management aspect is intriguing, and there are a lot of laughs as the calls of "Fire them!" come fast and furious towards the end.

RATING: 7
Great fun, but you have to really get into the "Actors in a musical" theme or it just boils down to a mathmatical game. So announce actors being hired by names, announce who is in your musicals when you put them on, and or course, shout out "I can't work with these people!"

RATING: 8
Very well designed game with very nice components that are very functional. Fun game play with short turns. Can support 6 players with little down time between turns. Certainly there is a luck of the draw factor, but if one avoids going after the same production types as the persons to his right, then that can be mitigated mostly. One complaint: the names for the actors are not very original and detract from the game.

Showmanager proves how much theme matters.  Its previous reprint assembled routes for cruise ships.  Who cares?  In Showmanager, the wacky actor names and caricatures put you squarely in an oily director's chair.  Assembling a show from a ragtag group of C-list celebrities (and precious few A-list stars) is hilarious, and the competition is tense.  The new reprint is gorgeous and an upgrade on all fronts.

This is essentially an elaborate set-collecting game- a very fun and thematic one. It plays best with 3-5, but is still worthy at 2 or 6. While Atlantic Star is mechanically identical, I think the Showmanager theme is much more appropriate.

RATING: 7
Showmanager is the kind of game that I can definitely see someone just getting into the hobby latching onto as one of their favorites in a nostalgic sort of way.  It's not quite a gateway/introductory game, but a second-level, small-step-up sort of game with a bit of complexity, but still fairly straightforward.  What it really does nicely is showcase the greatness of eurogames by having simple rules and a good deal of luck, but pairing those with a quick playing time and interesting decision-making.  If I'd played it toward the beginning of entering the board game hobby, then I think I'd have liked it even more because it would've really opened my eyes.  As it is, I've seen most of what Showmanager has to offer before in other games, but I still appreciated it for its elegance.  It doesn't have the same sort of depth and complexity that I'm generally looking for in games nowadays, and is sort of caught in that middle-ground for me between fluffy fillers and long meaty games, but I can nonetheless see pulling it out from time to time, especially with 6 players.

Show Manager has been quite well received since its initial release more than a decade ago with re-implementations in the form of Atlantic Star a few years back. Queen Games finally reprinted the original title which was really a retheming of Atlantic Star with a few added variants in game play.

The components for this game is standard Queen Games square box production which means the quality of the components is above par and art work is detailed and gorgeous. A note about the art: there are a few hundred cards depicting different actors in this game and no two are alike. That is a tremendous amount of art work in this game and kudos must be given to the artist(s) and Queen Games for putting in the effort to make each card unique.

Game play is relatively straightforward with players choosing to hire actors of varying caliber or stage plays in different cities. Victory points are then scored for the quality of each play based on collective skill of the cast of actors employed to stage the play. Players jostle to hire good actors for each role while casting aside the mediocre talent until desperation compels one to hire even an understudy to play the role.

Luck is quite rampant in this game in the form of cast selection. Only four actors are on audition each turn and if the suitable actors are not present, players can elect either to hire them outright or stage a new audition which costs money. Sometimes, even while burning through cash holding several auditions, the desired, highly skilled actors will not emerge and one is forced to stage a crappy play. This is a major source of frustration. Yet, the game is not nearly as frustrating likely due to the light theme and low complexity of the rule set. Choices are straightforward: you either try to get star actors by forking out the money for auditions or settle for a middling cast. The real decision is when to push your luck in getting a quality crew for high value plays.

Given its flaws, I am unclear if Show Manager will have any staying power but for now, it is a welcome reprint in the gaming community.

Egyszerű szabállyal rendelkező bevezető játék, kb a Ticket to Ride komplexitásának magasságában. Kivitelezés abszolut retro, ez manapság sokakat zavarhat, engem ez mindig arra emlékeztet, hogy a játékot a helyén kell kezelni, korának megfelelően. És ha így vesszük remek kis darab-gyors döntések sorozata, fél órás játékidő, 6 játékossal is remekül működik. megválltam tőle, az ajánlatot nem igazán lehetett visszautasítani és nem is bánom, de ha meglenne, akkor nem porfogóként lenne polcomon.

It was okay but I think I prefer Traumfabrik, which is vaguely similar. Some aspects of Showmanager are neat, but in general the gameplay has many things that turn me off, such as for example the card drafting mechanism that is very chaotic, considering how necessary certain specific cards are, and this is worsened by the hand limit that serves to make cards in hand that are not immediately useful very burdensome... also the presentation is pretty ugly.

7 after 1 play

Main game mechanic works fine, but it is quite incidental with higher player counts. However, more players are required to make the comparison between players mechanic work. Player interaction is also quite incidental, i.e. when to pay $2000 to change all the actor cards, which will affect the next player. Artwork is whimsical and nice. Good components are also good quality.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Interesting concepts, but luck of the draw is a huge factor... Having poor cards available and paying to cycle actors to access better cards will kill you when someone else gets good cards for cheap. Game feels mathematically over after 2 or 3 of the shows are booked, leading to a very frustrating endgame where your moves no longer are important. It also helps to be able to count cards and have a sense for who has played what strength of actors in their productions -- something I do not do very well.

Simple, press your luck type of game, in the purchasing of actors to put on the best plays possible.  Be careful of being greedy and end up with character cards that you can't actually use until later, since you there are rules against hoarding them by placing a hand restriction.

Update: I like the game, but I don't really look forward to playing it very often, I'd say once a month is enough.  Unfortunately it seem to be the one everyone suggest when there are 6 people looking for something to do.

After 2+ Plays: The strict hand limit means you have no choice but to be at the mercy of the card draws.  Kind of long considering the game seems to hinge on being lucky at a few key moments.

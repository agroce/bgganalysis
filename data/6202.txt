(Truth in Advertising: I was a playtester for this game)
RotRR is the successor to Berg's operational ancients system in The Conquerors,and like it's predecessor has fallen into a regrettable and unjustifiable obscurity. The game is complex, but once learned delivers the best understanding of how Republican Rome, Carthage, and Successor armies fought wars, as opposed to battles. Insightful and fun.

By not including a proper 2nd Punic War full campaign, Richard Berg, and GMT, are dropping the ball and letting us down.  Someone tell Berg to stop developing and designing games in a series WITHOUT completing the series.  Stop being so half-assed, RHB, and get off your ass and get the job done properly.

The rules, especially the scenario rules are a mess. All this Roman magistrate organization is really obnoxious and really sucks the fun out of the game. I played the Alexander and the Samnite scenarios. Both felt pretty generic and not like there was a lot at stake. There might be a good system in there, but after twenty hours messing around with it,  I don´t feel the ambition to continue searching for it.

With first game under my belt, I must say I am impressed with the game! :cool:  System is pretty cool once you get used to it and the game flows well, even with the number of charts involved.  However, once you get into the system, the chart reference is no problem.  The only drawback to the game may be the Roman politics.  If you do not have any knowledge of the history of the Roman Republic, I can see how this would be annoying.  However, if you love the Romans (like yours truly) then the rules not only make sense, but give the game historical flavor. :)  Without a doubt this game is a MUST for those interested in the Roman time period.  Currently, I have Pyrrhus set up and ready to go.  We shall see how The Eagle does this time! :)

RATING: 5
A great example of a Berg game - a nice basic system that's been cluttered up with oh-so-much chrome and detail. As so often with his games, the rulebook isn't very intuitive or easy to read, and there are two of them to look at here (one system, one game-specific).

Components are pleasant, if not ground-breaking.

Positives:
A smooth system of activation and movement.
Covers an interesting period of history.
Lots of chrome, particularly on Roman politics, for those that like it.

Negatives:
Four scenarios, each with so many special rules that you feel like you're relearning the game each time.
Chrome is overwhelming at the start - steep learning curve.
Lots of fiddly off-map counter placement and manipulation.

Despite its faults, I keep coming back to it. There's a good game in there, for sure.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Same as Carthage - I like the system (attrition, unexpected battle results), but the scenarios don't do it for me, and all the rules about Roman command control are too much for me - I think that could have been abstracted. Still, it is THE system for this level, and as a series should be a classic
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun but fiddly game. Each scenario has enough special rules to make it it's own microgame. Components are stunning. The movement system is innovative. You'll pick up a lot of history while learning this game. Big complaint is constantly messing with counters off map as armies are created and susequently added/subtracted from. I kind of feel like a bank teller at times. I might try to keep track of them on paper next time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Roman magistrate rules need the players to cooperate or the game will come undone to bickering.  Otherwise great game on the rise of Rome from city state to dominator of Italy.  Lots of rules, but not all are used in every scenario.  The first of what promises to be a developing system detailing the Roman conquest of the Med.  I like it but I am biased to Roman games.

RATING: 2
Seriously overwrought game with a set of rules that are not only too complex, they're basically unusable out of the box. You'll need the living rules, though it may be difficult to find the latest set. Yet another Berg game kit, really, rather than a proper game. After a couple other misfires of big, operational games I have no tolerance for such stuff any more.

Even if you do somehow manage to muddle through, the rules grit far exceeds any enjoyment you're likely to get out of the game. Just get [i]Sword of Rome[/i] and actually enjoy yourselves instead of wasting time with this.

Still not quite sure what i think of the game. Some qoutes which reflect my opinion on the game:

- "I played the Alexander and the Samnite scenarios. Both felt pretty generic and not like there was a lot at stake" - callasmar -  (i felt the same for both scenarios, but the Eagle scenario is different)

- "Carthage has a wildly fluid WW2 on multiple fronts feel vs RotRR WW1 trench warfare." - Herr Dr

- "none of the scenarios have significant depth as games because the element of chance is rather high." - janos_hunyadi

Still i somehow like it and come back to it, because it provides a great narrative. The Pyrrhus scenario is where the game shines.

I've played all four scenarios once each.

The rules are complex in places, there are a lot of new rules to learn for each scenario, and there is quite a lot of book work involved in playing this game. HOWEVER...the Ancient World system combined with the individual scenario rules produces a game that not only accurately and convincingly recreates Roman warfare but also enables some enjoyable and tense game play. Recreating the effect of the Roman political system on war is the most complex aspect of the game, but this is handled well and really adds some historical authenticity to the experience. 

The Hannibal Scenario is great as a learning exercise, but we also found it fun to play and fairly tense; the result hinged on the last die roll of the game. The Samnite Scenario also helps to learn the game - especially the rules for the Roman military and political system - and is also fun to play. The Alexander scenario features a similar level of die-induced unpredictability that is more welcome in such a 3-player free-for-all. Finally, there is the Phrrhus scenario. This is significantly longer and more complex than the other scenarios, but it is similar in feel.  

What prevents me from rating Rise of the Roman Republic among my top few wargames is that none of the scenarios have significant depth as games because the element of chance is rather high. The three smaller scenarios are great to learn the rules and work well as historical simulations (though Alexander has ahistorical elements added for balance) but are worth playing only once or twice each. The Pyrrhus scenario should have been an exception, but it isn't. It is longer and more involved and has more turns and twists of fate. But, in the end, there is the same feeling that chance dictates the result more than the decisions that the players make.

RRR is a great start to the Ancient World series which sets  the bar for ancient, strategic gaming. 

Superb game components and map delight the eye.    The game play is rich in historical feel  and provides the players with many tactically tense situations.   Hard decisions, the realities of campaigning in ancient landscapes and not enough activation chits make for exciting play with a definite period feel.    The mechanics favor common sense but are flexible enough to make gambits and innovative tactics pay off.   But the best laid plans are also subject to the will of the Gods at times.    Best sacrifice that prize bull before setting out. 

The game has a rep for being 'complex', but it is quite straight-forward.   Its the amount of detail that  makes for a learning curve.   No hardship because at the same time this gives the gamer unparalleled immersion into campaigning in the ancient world. 

 Chrome provides more feel for the age but doesn't hinder the game-play.

This game is perfectly suited  for PBEM .   Light your pipe, swirl the cognac and contemplate your next move....



The rules and basic Ancient World rules needed redrafting - and were to good effect with the release of the next game in the series 'Carthage'.  

(   I don't mark games down because of poor rules editing.     Call me wacky. ) 

A must for the the thinking gamer and ancients fan.

Pax Romania!  At last, a chance to track the history of the rise and fall of the Roman Empire in a Europa-format.  Sounds good and exciting. I am concerned about the balance of play though as Roman armies is a mighty force while the alien tribes are skirmishers at best.  Another concern is the designer's usual push for hard, dry, "realsitic" and tasteless historical recreation. Great leaders are included and add colours to the game. Looks like this is a myriad of political and military actions, with the Roman Senate consistently influencing the military actions and provinces coming into rebellion state if not closely watched by the Roman legions.  This is a one-mapper game, a big plus for me. Intricate interception rules are important and have great impact on how to deploy all you troops and legion.  The attrition rules instead of movement costs are reminisecnt to some of the Joseph Miranda's design on the ancient series.  It makes the game more fluid nad more strategic in nature at operational level manouver. Leaders can always continue action if he can pass the his campaign rating, something from Richard's own initiative rating of the individual leaders in GMT's GBoH series games.  Combined as one, the core system does take hold.

RATING: 8.4
Excellent innovative system.  The game includes several interesting scenarios including a 3-player of Alexander (the other Alexander) and the Samnite Wars.  Both of these can be played pretty quickly.  The main scenario will take more time but it also has a higher payback.  Armies pay attrition costs to move through terrain, but are otherwise unlimited.  Warfare is bloody and armies can break.  It has the single best term to describe a beaten army:  Useless.

This game looks like a standard hex based game but is very unusual. It has a series of unusual rules ideas that can be reasonably complex to master, but which form a system that seems to work well enough. The scenarios have multiple ways of achieving victory, with political options rather than just plain conquest a noticeable requirement for success. Game could do with a few more scenarios or at least expansion packs, however the larger scenario does provide good in-game options for players which provide a good degree of replayability. Putting in the teaser for Hannibal and then making us wait 10+ years is just cruel! Hopefully this series will continue at some point. This is a good game for those that liked "Life of Brian" and have a warped sense of humour.

Ouch. An exercise in rule complexity, this could be the best ancient games ever made, but R.H.Berg quality rules coupled with the quite arid system make this a very hard to learn and to play game.

This is a rather complicated war game. I like the asymmetric setup very much. Also, the four scenarios differ a lot from one another. It is in a way indeed four games in one.

The Roman political system is another very good feature of this game. It is fun if the senate does not grant permission to do something, which actually would be highly important.

Quite entertaining to play it solitaire.

I really like the system and can't wait for Carthage to come out, so I can get playing Punic Wars with this system.  The depth and detail really captures the feel of the era, particularly the political restraints the Roman player has to deal with.  But as a game alone, there's only really two good scenarios in this, one of which is an introductory scenario.  The other scenario that does stack up, though, is superb and is worth all the money.

This game feels like a Richard Berg game and it reflects his design principles: he doesn't (appear to) give a rat's tuckus or a moment's thought to the person playing the game.  Complexity is always better.  I like complex games, but this one (as usual) bogs down with the constant need for rule reading.  Try figuring out a combat, or an interception.  Thanks again Mr. B!

A great game. If you have read any of Livy, this game gives you a feel for things that were going on in the Second Punic War. It has over 800 counters, interesting mechanisms like revolts, rolling to see if any Gauls in your army loot cities and go home, historical flavor. The rules I found a bit hard to follow and not easy to consult as there are three sections to look in: the main rulebook, the scenario general rules, and each of the scenario rules. I thought comments within the rules could be in another column, footnoted or at the end of the rules. Nonetheless, this game is fun and very re-playable.

Addition: As of late I have been playing this game more and I have to say it is quite fun. Numerous things can happen and no turn is the same. The ability to intercept armies, ambush, take cities by treachery, form alliances make for an interesting game. The Vassal engine to play by email or online is great. I could say more...

Not for the faint of heart, but if you have a strong interest in the period, this is probably the best available operational-level treatment on ancient warfare. Some very clever mechanics, but a fiddly combat system, a heavy dose of chrome and a rulebook that is poorly written.

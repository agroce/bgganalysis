RATING: 4
Some cool ideas here, like heroes exploring dungeons for treasure, and it forces conflict in a good way.  BUT, the turns are just GLACIAL in pace.  You move everyone, then attack, then collect income, then buy units, then move new units again.  WAY too slow with too much downtime when it is not your turn.  Also, the game requires exactly 4 players to be any good at all and that lack of flexibility kept me from getting it to the table for years.  I had seen this compared to Nexus Ops favorably so I picked it up - do not be led astray, it is nothing like Nexus Ops in terms of its speed, streamlining, or flexibility.  Played once and sold.

Fun game with elements of lots of games like Risk and Small World that promotes advancement and lots of battles which require DICE.  Lots of fun and play with my 7yr old nephews who like rolling dice and are quickly understanding the mechanics - looks complex but has easy game mechanics.  Move, Battle, Conquer, Reinforce and collect your Gold :)  Will recommend at future gaming sessions.

An intuitive, fun strategy board game set in the 4th edition D&D default campaign setting, which I believe is now going to go defunct, so to keep it alive we've gotta play these WoTC boardgames. Comes with a ton of miniatures, and what I really love is not only the simple flow of play and battle interactions between different troop types, but the dungeons laid out on the board where you can send in troops and potentially gain treasure cards that can help your military force. Including iconic stuff like the 'Tomb of Horrors' fantastic idea, fantastic game.

An excellent game, both fast paced and highly strategic. Would be a bit more mundane without the Alliance gameplay, which takes the game from a regular dice-fest to an excellent dice-fest with synergy. The sides have identical units, but the event cards and treasures allow for some customization. All in all a great game, probably my second favorite wargame, just under Twilight Imperium (although this one is much easier to teach and play).

The VP option for the short and medium game risk an unsatisfactory game ending... at least from a wargamer's perspective. My short game ended with one side having knocked out one of the two enemy capitals but losing to VP gains of mostly empty territories. I supposed that can be explained as a political pressure to sue for peace but I was very annoyed!

For a long time, I'd wanted a copy of Divine Right as my "go to" game for old-school swords and sorcery on an epic scale. One play of Conquest of Nerath has just about replaced my desire for Divine Right.

It has a lot of the sorts of things I liked about DR (epic scale, asymmetric forces, weird creatures, mighty magic—even a bit of "dungeon plungin'"), streamlined it, brought in Axis & Allies-type unit-purchase mechanics s, and brought playing time back to the more reasonable span of a weekend afternoon.

Production is top-notch and is hard to beat for "dudes on a map" beauty. Heck, the scale of the bits and the size of the territories are compatible, for once, so there isn't that annoying "spill-over" that bedevils so many other games in this genre. Finally, the game is easy to learn and fairly snappy for the ground it covers. I was pleasantly surprised!

Axis & Allies but set in the D&D fantasy themed world of Nerath. Best with four players either as a set alliance or last man standing. Each faction has its own themed Event Card deck and unique sculpts for a lot of the units. In addition to the usual land-grab, Heroes (Fighters and/or Wizards) can enter and fight D&D themed monsters for extra gold and Treasure Cards as an additional source of VPs as well as useful power-ups.

Not many games have tried to combine army vs army action alongside individual character action - this game does it well and to be a serious contender the dungeons cannot be ignored.

The productions values (board, cards, figs, art work  etc.) are all excellent and the box tray is one of best I've seen for easy storage. The games is essentially Axis and Allies but instead of units having different "hit numbers" on a D6, here the base hit number is (normally) a six but each unit has its own die (from D6 up to D20). So: your basic beer and pretzels dice-fest in a most attractive package. D&D RPGers will recognize the Nerath universe especially the monsters.

RATING: 6
Conquest of Nerath quickly reminded me of two games: Nexus Ops and Starcraft. All three involve armies of different unit mixes, with area control, currency that you earn based on areas, and then turning around and spending that currency to pump out more units. The goal is to earn victory points. All three rely on cards as well for different perks and combat surprises.

Compared to those two games, Conquest offers a manageable set of rules, a complexity that's slightly higher than Nexus Ops but much more manageable than Starcraft, great bits, and a reasonable playing time. 

The only main drawback with Conquest is the downtime between turns. We played two-player teams, and it took a while for a round to make its way around the table. Nexus Ops avoids this by asking players to move less units, and Starcraft uses that nifty order token resolution to keep everyone involved. Instead, in Conquest, each player is pushing around 20 some pieces and resolving various combats. That takes time.

Still, I really enjoyed the game. That clever use of different sided dice, where everything 6+ is a hit but unit strength depends on what die you roll... that's freakin' clever and simple. I don't play this style of game too often, but it's a blast to grab a handful of three D6, two D10, a D8, and a D20, roll 'em, and watch the carnage.

I really wanted to like this game (and I do, but only up to a point).

While it took me some time to get used to the movement rules and also which die was rolled by which unit, the fundamental game mechanic is relatively simple. Move your units to try to score points, play cards which may have an effect on certain game conditions and then roll dice to see who wins the battle. Then you buy units to reinforce your position. 

The criticism I have of this game is that it is long (first game took 4 hours with 2 players), and for the wrong reasons. It is long because both sides are playing on a map with four factions (with each player controlling 2 factions each or 1 faction each in a four player game). This means that there are a great many tactical options each turn ranging right across the map, with 3 other factions to think about. This makes for slow going, and doesn't add much in terms of variety to the game. You just have to think through all the possibilities each turn. 

If I want a dose of a game with this theme and length, then I would prefer to play something like Descent (second edition). Similar theme and length, however the gameplay has much more depth and variety (i.e. it is not just about area control on a map).

Alternatively if I am after a tactical war game, then I would prefer to play something that is shorter and more focused (such as Command and Colors). 

I would play this one again, but not regularly. I also don't think I would enjoy the 4 player version as I expect there would be too much downtime. Having said that, the free-for-all mode with more players could be interesting (i.e. no alliances).

RATING: 7
Axis and Allies with dragons.  Oh, and dungeons.  Replaces Axis and Allies for me entirely, as it has more variety, more immediate action, and less of an "there is one best strategy that everyone knows" issue.  Still, same awful down time that A&A has.

I bought this for the free-for-all game, coz if I'd want a team game, I'd go for A&A, a similar game which is better structured and more strategic. However, I find the free-for-all rules unplayable right out of the box. There are 2 main problems:

1. The white player(last player by turn sequence) always earns less VP as one must first reconquer homelands before conquering others (reconquering don't earn you VPs). 

2. Some players can engage in an exchange-of-capital-deal. Since conquering a capital earns you 5 points, it gives players incentive to earn VPs by leaving one's capital open for each other a few times, just to run away from the other 2. Surely you can still play it that way, but the game kind of lost its flavour.

To fix this, our group comes up with a variant, which incidentally looks very simliar to roonechr's idea we later found on wizard's community forum. Here's a direct quote:

roonechr:
"You do not accumulate Victory Points for conquering enemy land spaces or claiming treasures. Instead, you calculate your Victory Point total at the end of each of your turns.  Each Control Marker you have on the board is worth one Victory Point. Add these to Victory Points from treasures you have claimed to get your total. If your total is greater than the VP goal, you are declared the winner. You perform the calculation anew at end of each of your turns; the results are not cumulative."

Our version of it is different in that we count the growth of income beyond the base income instead of control markers alone. So homelands conquered by others would be deducted from your points. E.g. Black's base income is 15. He conquers 5 pieces of land, but lost 2 pieces of his own at the end of his turn. This means he got 3 points for his conquest. Add this to his treasures, you got his score for this turn. We set the goal at 10 VPs, which works not bad for us. If you really want to have a truly balanced game, you might wanna decrease the required points for white a bit, but we still find the standard 10 point mark ok.

This saves the game for me, thus the score of 8 :) It might still go up with more plays.

Victory points, special powers, and tons of really cool minis make this Risk-like game lots of fun!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a well-designed, epic fantasy battle game. It's sort of like Axis & Allies, but with dragons, wizards, monster units and more. I have played once with two players and once with three players. You can use the victory point track for shorter games, but we played until one side was clearly headed for extinction. One of our games took 7 hours, but like I said we went beyond the victory point track.

Great components, cool map, dice.

Not sure about the event and treasure cards. Some of the event cards are so powerful a single card can turn the tide of war. My opponent destroyed nine of my armies by playing a single card and rolling well. Treasure cards give persistant bonuses that can be a pain to keep track of. Luck is also a big factor in battle.

If you have plenty of time and you like fantasy wargames, you'll have a great time playing this game! This game made me want to roll a character and play D&D again!

RATING: 5
DnD version of Risk: Territories equal income, income spent on buying units, moving into a territory begins combat. Each player can move all their units during their turn. Event cards are random and may make huge or little to no positive impact for you. Typically, going first is a huge boon in this game especially since army placement is preset and you border all of your neighbors in the beginning.

Huge con to replayability is that the starting positions are preset so games probably turn out very similar to each other in terms of where battles take place for the first round. One pro of the setup is that you don't waste time building forces and just begin combat early so the game's action starts quick.

Dungeon mechanism is unique but doesn't feel like you're questing. You just devote forces to fight neutral monsters for VP and random cards that add more luck swings to the game.

Teams and FFA game modes, good components and lots of different types of miniatures, a decent collection and variation of dice.

Excellent fast paced conquest game with a good Fantasy DnD Theme. Hell for Leather combat from the start, no slow build or research. Defending territory is far less important than manouverability and gorrila strikes.

Plays best with 4.  I recommend a house rule that you limit armies to the pieces in the box (Prevents a giant army of Wizards, or more than a few Dragons which would unbalance the game).  Partnership game seems to be the best too.  Reduces downtime and gets you invested in the other side of the board.  Overall, I had a lot of fun and would gladly play again.  Jones theories every other dudes on a map game, this is the one to play.  Everyone loves chucking fistfuls of dice.   This one has you chucking fistfuls of polyhedral dice!

This isn't the most original game I've ever played, but it does have some fresh concepts.  I like the dungeon delving opportunity, and all combat is decided by dice (instead of cards, a la [thing=59294][/thing]).  Even though length is scalable, our 4 player team game of 20 points took close to 5 hours to set-up, explain & complete (maybe we were playing incorrectly?).  Which leads to the second drawback: Downtime.  We played 4 rounds resulting in a player's turn taking 15 - 20 minutes, of course, you are engaged if it is not your turn because the chances are pretty good you are going to be attacked.  For the length of time it takes to play, I still gravitate to [thing=59294][/thing].

Plays like one of the Game Master series games. 4 players, two teams, territory control, lots of plastic monsters and dice. Its a zero sum game with territory being worth VPs and money so the game will eventually snowball one way or the other. Its ok but i prefer both Nexus Ops and Fortress America. It can run a little long, and doesn't have enough choices to detract from how well the dice are treating you on a given day.

Someone tole me that Conquest of Nerath was Axis and Allies in Fantasy clothing. I've never played A&A but I can say that I didn't really enjoy Nerath. It was a 2v2 game. There felt like a fair bit of downtime between players turns which was annoying. Beyond that the last person in the turn order got hammered by the 2 opponents and didn't really seem to have much of a chance at doing anything significant. Not really much to say about it other than I'm glad I didn't buy this one and played a friends copy.

Another Risk-like game with lots of direct player conflict. As I don't much care for games with lots of conflict I didn't enjoy this very much. To its credit, there is an alternative way to play the game through attacking dungeons and obtaining treasures that are worth points and special abilities, so if conquest is not interesting there is another avenue of playing. However the game did nothing for me and I will probably not play it again.

Turns took FOREVER--deadly.  4 players--almost an hour between each one of my two turns, then one more hour till the game ended just before my 3rd turn.

We played teams.  A very unbalanced game.  The first person to go demolished my forces, then built back up on the end of his turn.  Because he had additional lands, he had additional money to make his forces stronger.  I went into my turn greatly hindered, with reduced forces and lands.  I was unable to gain back territory and therefore revenue (and the accompanying VP's) and so could not reinforce my army as well.  

There was one well-used player aid for four of us--how skimpy is that?  However, the plastic playing pieces are impressive.  I liked the board too.

It's the modern Risk: incentives to attack and not back-and-forth, asymmetric sides, monotonic end trigger, in-the-action setup.

I love the fact that turtling is a losing strategy in this game. Much better than Axis & Allies.

The event cards (and treasures) add a lot to this game. I do feel however that some games can be decided by event cards.

A good mixture of Axis and Allies and Nexus ops.  Good world conquest game.  The bad guy races have a good starting advantage, but it appears they start to stall late game (like Axis and Allies)  The variety of units function the same for all the factions, but unique decks for each faction add some difference and originality to each side.

Evocative map and superb miniatures leads you to believe there's more to this game than there is.

Nothing much that interests me here. I've never played Axis and Allies so I'm going to say this is like Risk with different types of troops. The rules encourage you to actually attack, which is a very good thing, but in the end it's just an area control game with lots and lots of chrome. For some people that's exactly what they want and they could easily love this game, but me not so much.

RATING: 5
Beautifully produced and rich in ideas, this Risk-like game sinks under the same issues that Risk has.  Random chance can hand debilitating blows to plans that took many turns to implement.  There is no strong mechanic to bring the game to a close (it can be difficult to fully eliminate players, or even edge over them).

Good ideas worth noting: asymmetries of players are flavorful and important to play.  Flexibility afforded by diversity of troops adds a lot of flavor and makes for interesting deployment choices.  Implementation of ships, flying units, and ground troops is very satisfying in play.

Well worth it for the components, hours of fun for children, but does not hold up for adult play.  Wouldn't take much tweaking to improve.

A superior example of the Axis & Allies-style game, but still subject to all that form's foibles (if just in reduced form). It's still an attritional game, with piles of figures spilling out of the spaces they occupy, a combat system that doesn't scale (fist-fulls of dice, counting, repeat), an economy that sees you counting up your money every turn, downtime, chokepoints, snowballing, etc. None of those are bad things -- they're just things I don't really like in games any more. Nice pieces, good theme, and the game wisely starts you right at the point of conflict. Our play seemed prey to the usual swingy A&A-style "overbuild" strategy, with stacks of wizards first-striking the snot out of dungeons and instilling terror in the hearts of more balanced force compositions. Despite my reservations if you like these plastic-guys-on-a-map games you will probably enjoy this a lot.

Fun, high quality game that has the simplicity of Risk without its endless boredom. Our first full game took four players 3 hours to hit 13 VP, but it mean each player only played 3 turns. Since you never lose VP's, you have every incentive to attack mercilessly. This makes for an exciting evening full of momentous dice rolls and desperate, hasty planning. This is my favorite dudes-on-a-map game of the moment.

RATING: 7
It feels a bit like "Risk", as a simple conquest game where all territories start occupied, but it improves on it with many different units, naval transportation and a welcome Fantasy theme.

Despite the variety, I didn't find hard to remember what each unit does. On the combat, I like that rolling a 6 or more is a hit, regardless of unit type, with stronger units rolling dice with more faces (some miniature bases indicate which die). And each faction has its own card deck, which makes them unique. The game rewards attacking from the start, and it avoids back-and-forth border disputes by giving points only for the conquest of regions that originally belonged to enemies. The dungeons, where you battle monsters for artifacts with special powers and victory points, are a nice addition.

However, the game may still be quite random. Besides the inherent luck of card draws and dice, the monsters may vary wildly in strength, and they are only revealed when attacked. Also, it's primarily a four-player game and doesn't scale quite well, forcing players to control more than one faction if there are fewer.

The worst thing, though, is the downtime. Each full round lasts about an hour. There is just too much to consider and to do on your turn: draw (and read) a card, move all your pieces, battle, move your flying units again, buy and place pieces (of nine different types), move newly placed units, and finally earn money, besides deciding the best time to play your cards. I have enjoyed my few plays, but they were with just one other player. The  downtime might be unbearable with four, and you can't even leave the table during other players' turns, because you may want to play cards and have to decide which units to lose in battle.

My opinion may be a little biased because of the beautiful miniatures and my fondness of Fantasy, but I still think this is a good game. And it might be a great game if the player turns lasted half the time.

It's just A&A with D&D-themed minis.  True to their unfortunate (but well-earned) reputation, WotC has slapped the brand onto something and shipped it out the door.  Oh, go ahead and tell me there are "dungeons" and victory points in this.  Whatevs.  It's Axis and Allies.  Your opponent buys 100 dragons, you buy 1,000 wizards and the two of you slug it out over a couple of chokepoints.  The winner gets determined by the third or fourth turn and yet it takes another 90 minutes to finally wear the loser down.  "Play a 'Quick Game' variant," you say?  The game takes too long to set up to make that worthwhile.  I don't hate this game.  Sometimes I find myself really wanting to play it.  But that's not very often, and considering the price...

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game is essentially a D&D themed Axis & Allies free-for-all. It can be quite fun.

In my first (and only play so far), the rolls of the dice decided the winner much more than strategy. Due to the game's length, this can be quite frustrating. 

I'm looking forward to trying this again soon.

RATING: 7
This is a fun variant on the standard Axis and Allies template. It superficially promises to be a major dicefest between huge armies, using a splendid set of polyhedral dice. But actual play tends to involve a more delicate style of feinting and raiding along the borderlands, while your "hero units" race to collect the most treasures. This can either be a good thing (if you want a different style of game than a massive attrition war game like Risk), or an exercise in frustration (if you try to play it as though it should work like Risk and keep losing).

There are some definite balance problems with the game's units, and I'd recommend the use of some house rule adjustments if you want to see more than half the unit types actually being built by experienced players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The game falls slightly short because the combat system is so standard - they could have done more with more initiative levels than just "mages and then everybody else" (kind of like SE:4X or the Ares Project). Other than that, one of the best Risk-alikes I know, right up there with Ikusa.

This is a dudes-on-a-map game, except your dudes are from fantasy armies.  This is really a dream game for the geek children and teenager, risk meet D&D, a game I would have killed for when I was that young.
The box is a testimony to the fact that WoTC is owned by Hasbro with its cleverly designed thermoformed and durable insert that I will *not* throw away.  The figures are ravishing, the game is probably too long if the theme does nothing for you.
I must still try the variant I've found on BGG to speed up play, but I already like this game despite its length.

Play with this additional rule: "You can’t ever have more than 1 dragon of your color in the same space."

Alternate variants: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1558460/playtested-house-rules-designed-improve-unit-diver

1# Each player can only field 4 dragons at any one time.

2# Monsters “hate” dragons. They have a D20 attack die instead of a D12 in any battle as long as the enemy army includes a dragon.

3# When a siege engine is defending a land space with a castle it gains one extra d8.

4# Flying creatures cannot conquer territory on their own. You must have a surviving land unit at the end of a battle to take an enemy territory.

Also: Medium/short game: Nerath starts with one extra event card (a pretty big advantage to the good side)
Long game: Nerath and Iron Circle start the game with one extra event card (still a small buff to good since Nerath's event cards are better than Iron Circle's)

Like Risk, which was my own gateway game, but so much better for being quicker (if you want) and having dungeons and dragons!

The use of the differently sized dice feels innovative - it's a little counterintuitive that an 8 is so much better than a 6, for example, but innovative all the same.

Scoring points only for conquering regions not originally one's own sounds great in theory - in practice it can lead to a strange detente where each player holds the other's territory and doesn't recapture one's own for fear of yielding easy points.  Strange doesn't begin to describe the thematic disconnect.

Treasures all seem game-breaking in specific ways, which implies a certain balance.  Variability in strength of guardians is a concern, as it's randomness one can't mitigate against (at least for the first fight).

It's nice that the game length is adjustable.

I spent most of my play wishing I were playing a 4x game instead of just rolling dice and killing stuff - which probably means dudes-on-a-map games just aren't for me.  One play was enough in my case, but it's a matter of taste.  I can't really argue that this is a bad game.

Was pretty disappointed with this game. I expected it to have a lot more theme and a lighter adventure feel mixed in with the Risk-like war mechanics.

I've often seen this game compared to Risk, but it's quite a bit different. First I think it's more balanced, you don't have the avalanche effect as much. That is where the winning army gaining more and more territories in turn gets more and more reinforcements to completely trounce the ever dwindling army of thelosing opponent. 
You actually have oceans you can cross with troop transports to invade opponents coastal territories. 
Flying units that can cross unfriendly territory.
A great dungeon exploring mechanic to improve units via magical waepons.  
All in all a great simple war game.

A Dicey McDice-fest of Diceyness. With Dice. And it's FUN. Board is setup so you will be taking over territory and marching to war the very first turn. Slightly asymmetrical armies and event decks are interesting. And the Dungeons/treasures are fantastic. Goes a little longer that I would like but overall my go-to Dudes-on-a-map when I'm not feeling like thinking too hard. Has a hard time getting to the table, though, since it doesn't play well with 3, is a war game, and takes a little too long to setup and play. Oh, and Dragons are too cheap.

RATING: 8
Really enjoy this fantasy-themed spin on Axis & Allies.  It's easy to learn (most players with any experience in the genre can be taught the few special rules in less than ten minutes) and moves at a good clip.  The design team did a good job building the map, which forces players to think about both land & naval strategy, and the pieces have enough differentiation that the right call isn't to always build as many of the cheapest unit as possible.  Only played it as a two-player game, so the downtime was more than acceptable.

We adjusted Dragons to a cost of 6 and that fixed the Dragon issue for us.  We normally bid to play the human/elf alliance and allow the player with the lower bid to deploy units before play begins equal to the gold bid.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Decent dudes-on-a-map game with very nice components, akin to Axis and Allies in many respects but a bit simpler rules wise. Longish, but most DoAM games are.

Update: Have now played with 4 (in an alliances game) and found a 4-player alliance game to be a highly enjoyable experience. Our "short" (to 20 VP) game took roughly two and a half hours for a learning or refresher game for everyone. I could see playing the medium (to 30 VP) game but not the long one.

My major complaint, if you want to call it that, about this game is the way that realms sometimes end up just doing a "shift" around the board as the game progresses. In an effort to reward aggression and punish turtling, the game gives a VP (5 for a capital) for each enemy territory conquered, which happens immediately after the conquest. This means that there is comparatively less incentive to protect or recover home territories lost, since only income is restored this way. Without the "long" game's fixed objectives, the "short" and "medium" games can just devolve to exchanging territory rather than building and defending a realm.

Update: Having played the "medium" game (4-player alliance), I'm not sure that it adds anything but length to what was already apparent by the time we'd reached the short-game threshold.

With very little interaction between players this game has an incredible amount of downtime. Literally 75% of the game is spent sitting and watching other players.

In games with shorter turns this is forgivable because there is a lot to think about for your next turn. But with very long turns in which a player has a lot to do and the board can change a lot, there isn't much planning ahead allowed.

A lot of people compare this game to risk..Are you blind???It's not risk it's Axis and Allies!
I like this game a lot,dice rolling and complex strategy but not so complex to leave an headache...
Fast play our first four players game lasted about 2 hour and swiftly and tricky tactics and strategies to win....
As I said it's much like Axis and Allies but the game is less blocked than Axis and Allies ,you got more free strategies due the the balancement of the board(there is no balancement in A&A ,different nations get a different game,and some of them cannot do anything effectively..)
A very good game one of the most funny I have ever played,and it's not just luck like risk ,not at all.Maybe a little more luck plays in the dungeons:It's fun to get a random monster but probably balanced ones for each dungeon would have been better....Anyway this could be seen even as risk management...Shoud I risk attacking with 2 heroes or get another one with them?
The funniest game is the free-for all one but is very good even played with alliances
No difference between 2 and 3 players games so I don't understand people who click on not recommended in 3...

Conquest of Nerath is a fantasy conquest game. 2-4 players muster armies of foot soldiers, siege engines, monsters, warships, elementals, and dragons to attack their opponents.

I like how WotC is really thinking outside of the box as far as where they can take the D&D license. Nerath is a valiant effort in this vein.  There are some fundamental issues with the game (such as the races feeling too [i]samey[/i], which can be resolved by drawing [i]two[/i] cards a turn), but the classic feel of the game is unmistakable and where it is successful.  As always, both dungeons and dragons are included, which itself would be a shoehorn in any other light-wargame.

Risk, for D&D fans, improved.
Each player uses one or more of the four unique races available. The objective is, guess what, to conquer the world.
This game features a very wide arrangement of different units, and a very good management system, fast, simple, and efficient. Also, each race has its own units, its own special rules, and its own set of event cards.
On the downside, the rules do not allow you to play with fewer than the four intended races, leading to awkward arrangements when you have three players. Also, the alliances between the races are fixed, as it is fixed the order in which they play (in fact, the cards are studied to make up for the disadvantage of starting later).
Recommended.

RATING: 5.2
A good title if you're looking for a fantasy based big army slugfest. Roll the standard polyhedrals minus the d4 and try to wipe out the enemy. Gaining actual ground is pretty tough as the enemy will likely not let you build up enough to keep territories you've taken and opportunities to advance more than one space at a time are slim.

The game does offer you several alternatives for ending the game mostly to do with victory points. The game seems a little long even at the shortest level though because there isn't that much buildup. The Dungeons help with this a bit but the game you are playing at the start is pretty much the same game you will be playing through to the end without much variance. I cannot imagine what the total elimination game must be like.

I expect I will like this game better with the alliances than the free for all.

Solid A&A play with a D&D skin. Only played 2-player: This game would have legs if it were better balanced, but maybe with the politics 4 players it's fine. IHowever, we've found evil to be stronger. Also, the game devolves into spamming dragons. They're just better than other units 90% of the time.

This game is worthy of more than a 7, but on one play it's a 7.

The components and presentation are stellar, from the awesome insert to the equally awesome pieces and the clear rulebook. I upped the dice count (4d20, 6d12, 6d10, 8d8, 12d6) and never had shortages in a 4-player game.

It also delivers on its promise of a streamlined, intuitive wargame that throws you right into the action but which still features quite a bit of strategy.

That said, even considering the learning game element of any first play, I spent on average 15 minutes per hour making interesting decisions and 45 minutes per hour watching things happen and, aside from talking strategy with my ally, not having fun. I could tell after the Karkoth player's first turn that his alliance was going to win, but I still had to play things out for two hours to watch it happen.

On top of that, the scripted setup and turn order meant that Nerath got to watch himself get fucked for 45 minutes having made zero decisions whatsoever. I missed the rule about drawing two event cards to form an initial hand, which certainly contributed to that problem, but I'm not convinced that the problem will go away in future plays.

There's a lot here that I still want to see, and I'm not great at this type of game (which influences my opinion of CoN). Still, a 7 is a fun game I want to keep in my collection, and it definitely deserves additional plays.

Solid Game

Played once.  I was a bit skeptical that this was just going to cash in on the franchise, but once you got over the silly names, it was a lot of of fun.  Interesting tactical challenges.  Balancing each front with dungeon delving.  Exploiting opportunities.  Risk on steroids done right.

We played with alliances and the shorter game,  The ending was a bit artificial with desperate bids to squeeze the last couple victory points, without regard to the next turn, but it didn't feel cheap and was a great way to learn.  Only downsides are the longer play time required and the lack of multiple player reference aids with army costs/powers/capabilities.

RATING: 5.5
Found the game to be overly long for what it was (even the short game) and figured that I would be unlikely to get much play out of it.  Dungeon delving overpowered and quite random.  Long down time between turns with two player, so wouldn't play it with more.  Have much better 2 player games to play.

Best strategy for short and medium games seems to be to buy up wizards and spam the dungeons, while doing enough to keep some map control.  While the powers the treasures give are useful, the VP they give make them exceptionally powerful (too powerful for the theme of conquest to really hold).  Also there is little incentive to retake captured provinces (as it leaves an opening for point farming, unless you retake with a significant force that would be better deployed taking another territory held by an opponent).

Doubt I'll ever get to play a long game (where capturing the capitals is mandatory). Sold it on so don't really care.

Enjoyable in the same way LOTR Risk is enjoyable--there is plenty to do and consider each turn like whether or not to send your heroes into the dungeons for extra resources (risky), how to best carry out your strategy based on your units (which play very differently), how to utilize your specific army's action deck.  Overall an interesting take on the "guys on a board," risk-style game.  Looks good on the table, too, thanks to WOTC.

Слишком долгая игра для такой ужасно устаревшей механики. Такое впечатление, что автор, кроме Axis & Allies (на механике которой построена эта игра) ни во что стратегическое больше не играл. Более того, он её ещё более испортил механизмом начисления ПО: даются каждый раз за захват вражеской территории, но не отнимаются, при освобождении. В результате, получается странная ситуация, когда игрокам не выгодно очищать свои территории от оккупантов.

RATING: 6
Pretty much just a variant on Risk, but a good one. Just a bit overpriced for what it is. Points are handed out for conquering territories though, so it makes you want to go on the offensive more than turtle up in a corner of the map. Ultimately I thought the game was fine. The team mode makes this feel more unique than Risk, but I didn't really feel much of a D&D vibe from this game. You have heroes that can delve into dungeons for treasure, but apart from that, you might as well be playing a high fantasy game in some generic universe. Plus I feel like this is ultimately a dice fest, which Risk can also be accused of being, but the newer versions of Risk, like my personal favorite, Game of Thrones, have added enough in to keep it from feeling quite as random. As such, I think this is a decent dudes on a map game, but ultimately not very memorable.

Would rather play Game of Thrones Risk.

RATING: 7.5
Being a lifelong avid D&D gamer, this is a boardgame I was after since it came out on 2011, but it took me 3 years to find it a decent price.

The game components are quite nice, there are a lot of minis (although you will probably need some tokens because there are not enough) and many dices. Good quality stuff.


I have enjoyed several things:
-> The rules and the disposition enourage offensive approaches. You win points by conquering, cold war and turtle tactics don't seem likely.
-> The game changes a lot in each turn. It doesn't seem to have a snowball effect.
-> Rules are logic. there are no weird things nor a zillion of small rules for specific cases. Once you read the rules, chances are you will not need to check the manual again.


For me, its main drawback is its lenght. If people plays fast everything will go OK, but when they start to ponder all possible actions by your enemies and discuss with their allies, AP can happen.

I guess replayability will not be infinite. There are some random elements in dungeons, cards and rolls, and even if the armies are symetrical, event deck compositions are quite different and the map disposition grant different experiences depending on the side you choose.  But at the end of the day you always play on the same map.

You start the board with troops scattered over a bunch of regions. You can only win by conquering other regions (it's a VP hunt). So gather several groups into some slathering hordes and go forth and dice, dice, dice away. 10+ different troop types dictate which die to roll (you hit on 6+ but weak units roll d6's, great units roll d20's), movement points and a special power or two, giving enough extras (like first strike or double attack at sea) to think about without being overwhelming. But in the end it's like any number of Risk games - gather, move, roll, kill. There's a Nexus Ops style decision on which troops to buy - plenty of fodder to absorb hits and protect your big units, and then which big units do you want. You can distract yourself with exploring dungeon regions if you like for VPs (ie flip a tile, beat its dice roll in a dice war). But in the end it has all the same problems as any other multi-player combat game, plus turns take forever, the game can hinge on who gets early hits in big battles, and there's not enough interesting decisions. Not very satisfying as a result.

Loved it, at first. Great factions. Easy to learn combat. Good alliance rules. I like that it has varying lengths you can play. I REALLY like that, actually. There's times you just don't want to play a conquest game for 4+ hours.

2nd play reveals to me a heckuva lot of down time between plays. Knocked down to a 7.

Seemed very unbalanced (favoring black, grey was screwed from the start). This is something that should get better with repeated plays, and according to the forums, with longer games. Unfortunately there isn't much opportunity to make a come back if you're in trouble or make a mistake, so it was pretty clear who would win before the game was actually over. Not something I enjoy. Might be convinced to try again, but only if everyone would agree to quit as soon as it's the same again...

Awesome game for "dudes on a map", the dice-rolling mechanic is beautifully streamlined system.

Wow they did everything right. From the smallest details like setting the units on the map (there are visual indicators printed on the map as well as small set up maps) to the various molds for the units. This is a bit of Risk (Godstorm or 2210), a bit of Axis and Allies and a whole lot of Nexus Ops. This plays like a monster version of Nexus Ops with significant depth over the smaller game. Pure pleasure from start to finish. A player is challenged to attack in order to score points while having to defend on two fronts. Frustrating, challenging, very enjoyable. The two player and four player games are excellent. I have not tried with three but I suspect it would be quite a challenge. 

The only thing that keeps this from a 10 rating is that the names and map mean nothing to me. I have only played D&D once and that was 20 years ago so this could have been Lord of the Rings, some alien planet, whatever. Still an excellent game.

It's good, but it can feel "meh" after some games. I believe the game lacks different setups and scenarios (using only X cards of each faction, beginning with different monsters on different spots, etc).

This game was friggin' awesome!

That's what I'd say if I was 14, it was 1987 and I was looking for a replacement for Supremacy. Something that could be played in four hours with only 45 minutes downtime, you know?

Simple rules, but far too many units involved in tit-for-tat combat over and over again. Nice touch with the polyhedral dice for combat - which is over quickly - but it is a throwback to Risk twenty years ago. The biggest crime is the downtime. Move ALL your units, comat, build - all in one turn before another player's turn. And with 20 - 25 units that's a LONG turn. You need an iPhone to watch an episode of Game of Thrones in a four player game.

Couldn't see myself coping with this again. An anacronyism of a game if there ever was one.

This game does nothing unique, but what it does it does pretty well. It's a suitably epic setup, with a lot of pieces spread over a big board. In its standard form it's violent and dicey, with tons of big battles that happen right away. It's basically Nexus Ops for someone who wanted a more epic affair, though there are also ways to play a long Gamemaster-style game. WotC consistently delivers on the D&D license in board game form, and this is no exception.

It's disheartening for the reputation of board games when you read of somebody who slaved at a game design for years, only to find it is just an offshoot of Monopoly, UNO etc. In this case, Axis & Allies. You will know how to play this if you know A&A, period. Some differences:

1. It has cards (though no system for drawing more aside than 1 a turn). Cards give at least a slight need of coordination, so that 2v2 isn't essentially being half of a single person. Haven't yet seen a game in this genre that has been able to make 2v2 more than just 2 people controlling 1 person.

2. Every enemy space is a VP, instead of just a few select locations, so the fighting is everywhere instead of a couple of chokepoints.

3. Get a VP only when conquering an enemy region, which is weird to see play out, but this makes the whole game mechanically. You can actually establish footholds and hold them now, and use them as a base for further incursions, because your enemy is not incentivized to take the region back (whereas in other games like this, you get smacked down whenever you build a castle on the frontline). In reality though, it's just... weird, with its restriction on your attacking patterns feeling artificial (i.e. you feel like "I'm not doing this because the God of Nerath told me I don't get VPs for it", instead of it being natural)..

4. Dungeons for questing and earning VPs, which help move the game along when it bogs down because it's hard to get more VPs after you've taken enemy borderlands.

5. Units attack and defend the same (and usually defend worse), instead of defending better than attacking, so less turtling.

6. Different attack dice for each unit, and all hit at 6 or higher, so it's easier to remember, and you can roll dice at once instead of rolling D6s repeatedly.

Suffers from MB Gamemaster Syndrome, where the Short Game is too short, the Medium Game is too long, and whoever devised the Long Game needs to be shot for having so much free time to roll buckets of dice.

The designers have obviously sought to eliminate turtling, as seen in #3 and #5, and evidenced by the confrontational setup, where it's no-holds-barred smackdown from turn 1 (in fact, the fighting seems to peter out later on due to the sheer number of casualties), and I commend them for that. #3 is the standout.

It's A&A improved, but feels like A&A slapped with a theme.

6.5 might be a little harsh (esp after just one run-through), but I just don't think this is a game that will see a lot of play time.  In general, I love the look and feel of Dudes-on-a-Map games BUT... there are too many buts - too long, too repetitive, never enough room for real strategizing.  

CoN does some things right, though.  You're in your opponent's face from Turn 1, and there's constant encouragement to invade and never turtle (VPs are gained from taking over enemy territories).  The different decks for the different races create some interesting opportunities for sudden reversals of fortune.  Making the decision to go into a dungeon with a few heroes is a difficult one - and the rewards can be highly beneficial.  As an example, as the Elven nation I found an Orb of Dragonkind that made it so my dragons did 2 damage on a roll of 15 or higher.  I probably got 5 or 6 of those 15+'s over the next 3 turns, so it totally paid off.  Games are *relatively* short (at least for this genre) - our 2-player game lasted 4 hours, including learning and set-up.  Now that we know how to play, I suspect we could finish in 2-3.  Still a bit long for my taste, and I doubt I could stand the downtime in a 3 or 4 player game.

Nowadays, I'd rather play something tighter...more tactical, like Space Hulk or Claustrophobia or Ashardalon.  

The insert in this game kicks total ass, BTW.  I'm surprised to say it, but I think Wizards of the Coast is making some great boardgames.  This one just might not be my bag.

Great war game.  It's got a pretty simple system (similar to Axis and Allies) but it's improved with the powerful but balanced powers and treasures.

It's nice that you can pick up victory points from dungeon crawling so, even if you're losing on the front lines, you can pick up a powerful item or collect some gold and points.

A good Risk-like area control game.  There is plenty of room for developing different strategies and, if you play at least the medium-length game, time to put them into play.  Short games suffer from an easy rush mentality; I played a game where I literally just bull-rushed my opponent, not really caring about the casualties I took, and eked out a win.  That strategy would never work in a longer game.

That brings me to my only real gripe:  this game can be plenty long.  It's overall good and interesting, but the sheer amount of things to take into consideration while moving and buying units can bog the game down so it can take several hours.  Good if you have time for it, but can be a slog if you fall behind and you know your opponent will win, but it will take several turns for him to achieve the victory conditions.

Played a game of it at PAX East 2012; turned out to be not my style of game. Plodding pace, too much annoying treachery, and worst of all, very fussy rules with no cheat sheets for the players to recall, for example, the cost of things, base income, etc. I'd maybe try it again with friends. Maybe.

RATING: 4
The pieces are quite nice, especially with the variety between the different sides. The gameplay is...not so nice. A lot of downtime between turns, and the battles and recruiting lack excitement. The event cards feel very random and don't really provide much flavor.

It seems like a grab-bag mix of Nexus Ops, Runewars, and Quest for the Dragonlords, but it doesn't pull them together in a good way. The units don't have exciting differences (ala Nexus Ops), the heroes and quests aren't interesting (ala Dragonlords or Runewars). The VP system encourages attacking, but it doesn't drive the game in the exciting and dynamic way that the VP and objectives in Runewars do.

Combat is needlessly clunky; its slow to figure out and gather all the dice you need. This can be improved a bit by having more dice than the game comes with; a LOT more. You'll want enough for both sides to roll at once. Stat references for the price of each unit to go in front of a player would also be an improvement.

Traded this - even what it did do well, other conquest games did better.

RATING: 7
Fantasy-themed conquest game. There are two alliances comprised of two factions each, and the object is to attain a certain amount of victory points through capturing areas of the map board. Combat is simple with each unit scoring a hit on a dice roll of six, with different units rolling a specific dice based on their perceived strength i.e. foot soldiers roll a d6 whereas dragons roll a d20. An element of asymmetry is introduced to the game through each faction having its own deck of cards that can be played to accompany specific actions (although they are mainly related to combat). There are further victory points to be acquired through exploring dungeons and this aspect of the game provides a pleasing distraction from player versus combat. Negative issues with the game relate to the seemingly imbalanced factions stemming from the first player having a distinct advantage, and the large amount of downtime in a four player game (the game plays far better with two people controlling two factions each).

An excellent game with play format similar to Axis & Allies. It can be played much faster though. Game length is usually about 2-3 hours.  Unfortunately, success can depend very much on the luck of drawing certain cards. Strongly recommend a rule change whereby dragons and storm elementals cannot win territories on their own. Adds to strategy value and makes the game more fun.

Nicely made, weighty pieces, designed for easy set-up, nice random effects, adaptive gameplay, very strategy heavy despite random elements. Honestly, this was some of the most fun I've had with a board game.
So the problem? 
This game, to be played well, DOES require you to modify your plans in response to the actions of opponents, but it IS a "winning strategy" game. The player who has the most concrete idea of what does and doesn't work and is or isn't the best paths to victories WILL win. Consistently. I said I had fun? Yeah, cause I never lost. And no one would play me after the 5th time or so. A game should reward good playing, but it's a real problem here...

Not much time actually spent on game play or strategy. One hour to set up all the tiny pieces and then 30 minutes per player per turn...expect about 2 hours for one turn with a 4 player game for your first game. I guess OK if you have other things to go and do while other players take their turns. Not a lot of choices, just attack or explore a dungeon, and then roll a bunch of dice. And with 9 different unit types, hard to remember what they all do as you try to move them around (it's not on your player board). Not sure about piece limitations...for example, Vailin are the masters of the seas, yet, I think they had only four ships...now you can use the disks if there are more than one in the same area, but what if you want to spread out to more than four sea areas? And unfortunately, the theme didn't really shine through here...I guess the minis are cool.

This is a nice risk type of game with a few interesting twists. Components are simply great! But they should had included 4 player aids that provide a summary of all the pieces (big complaint here about this). Go here in the file sections and print 4 copies! The game is a lot of fun. We play with 2 variants: Pieces are limited to the number of figures in the game (this provides nice variety). Flying creatures cannot pass through enemy regions that have flying creatures as well (this adds some element of defense. Your air-force can stop the opponent's air-force. This is a great nice game! people will say that it is a little unbalanced, but this is what makes it to be fun!

I have only played the medium game so remember my comments are based 100% on that experience.

Despite having minis Nerath does not play like a realistic sequence of battles between armies seeking to win dominance over an area. Instead it plays like an abstract game where the goal is to score 30 points by taking over enemy territories.  The game discourages a player who has been defeated in battle to take back what they have lost because it will just set up their opponents with a chance to gain more points by taking it back again.  Rather, players are constantly seeking to take over their opponent's territories over their own because it scores points.

I like that Richard Baker, Mons Johnson, and Peter Lee had the balls not to take the easy way out and follow convention with their game design.  Nerath is an abstract fantasy quest of scorched earth with nice components that more importantly, is a well designed game.

Blows Axis & Allies out of the water. My dragons fly! Mounted on metal "stands" (improvised from [gameid=1836]) Apollo 13 edition (lucky thrift find). One of the better Risk, slash, dice-chucker clones out there and underrated, for sure... otherwise, I'd give it an "8". I will only play this game two player - anything more would be torture (unless you have a game room). Production/design quality is simply gorgeous (except the dragons for the Vailin Alliance look like dried loogies). Wish I had waited a little for the price drop.

I love it! After 3 plays, this game has really become my DoaM game of choice. Its fun balancing dungeon delving with combat (and I really appreciate the fact that dungeon delving is so well integrated with the rest of the game - treasures found in dungeons grant bonuses to your entire faction, and heroes that fight in dungeons can also fight enemy armies). The event cards are a nice touch and can keep the opening turns from becoming too stale. Box insert is top notch, components great (a shame there is no art on the treasure cards though): overall this is a wonderful package of fun.

War has come to the Dungeons & Dragons world! In the north, the undead legions of the Dark Empire of Karkoth march against the fragile League of Nerath, determined to sweep away the human kingdoms forever. To the south, the infernal Iron Circle launches its own goblin hordes in a campaign of conquest against the elves and corsairs of Vailin. From the snowy expanse of the Winterbole Forest to the sun-warmed coasts of ancient Vailin, four great powers struggle for survival.

Conquest of Nerath is a fantasy conquest game. 2-4 players muster armies of foot soldiers, siege engines, monsters, warships, elementals, and dragons to attack their opponents. Players employ heroes such as knights and wizards to lead their troops and explore dungeons in the search of magical artifacts and treasures to increase their power in combat.

RATING: 5
Reading the rules of this game, I thought I was in love...

In a lot of ways, Conquest of Nerath resembles a fantasy Axis and Allies (a game I love) with a neat dungeon/quest system tacked on.  What's so appealing is that each unit is very different, with many interesting special abilities.  These aren't just 2-strength vs. 3-strength troops, each unit is unique and cool in its own way.  This is by far the best aspect of the game, and almost enough to make me love it on its own.

Unfortunately, the VP rules are just plain wonky.  You get points for capturing other people's territory, but not for reclaiming your own.  Ostensibly, this forces offense and dissuades turtling, both good features in this sort of game.  In practice it ends up strongly disincentivizing reclaiming your own territory (since you're just setting up your opponent to score more easy victory points, with little gain for yourself), which leads to a really wonky and athematic style of play.  By the midway point, you're likely to control half your opponents' territory and them half of yours, and everyone's just moving their nomadic army clockwise around the board, abandoning their own kingdoms.  It's incredibly gamey.

Others have noted how extremely powerful the dragons are, and yeah, they are.  I think this is not nearly as big a deal as the VP issue, however, and could be easily tweaked for balance (e.g. by raising their cost).  Note that I'm not saying it needs this since I'm really not sure.  Just saying it's a much easier thing to fix than the VP conditions, which are at the heart of the game.

A game where a few bad dice rolls can literally cripple you for the whole game.

A few bad results in combat can lose you enough land that you earn less resources with which to purchase troops, and those taking the land from you then earn more income to purchase even more troops with which to smack you down even further.

Also far too open to kingmaking - the only "fun" I had in the last 2/3 of the game was finding an easy path to letting another player steal victory from those who spent the game actively destroying my chances of even coming third.

Highly unlikely I would ever play again.

[i]Well, this really isn't a diplomacy game. You conduct most of your diplomacy with troops, wizards, and dragons.

I think this game is mainly about sh*t-talking, rolling fistfuls of dice, and shoving a ton of plastic in your opponent's general direction.[/i]


[b]Evil energy is like evil force. Change its direction, and it changes to good! [/b]


1. This game surely deserves some applause purely for including [i]actual[/i] dungeons to be explored inside a mass battle game system.

2. The wonderful names on the map are places to be visited inside my own mind: Vault of the Drow, Tomb of Horrors, White Plume Mountain, Temple of Elemental Evil, etc. If I had designed this game (all game mechanisms aside), I would have created a similar map for sure.

3. Initial unit types are marked on the board - no [i]Risk[/i] style set-up here.

4. Victory point track down the side of the board - this I always admire. Simple things.

5. Amazing set of miniatures for each of the 4 factions. Outclasses [i]LoTR: Risk[/i] and [i]Risk: Godstorm[/i], easily. For great innovation, look at the bases of the models - each one also represents the type of dice it can roll. Clever, clever stuff.

6. Terrific box insert. Maybe the best.

7. Simple and clear rules.

8. Great theme! Dungeons and Dragons on an epic scale.

9. Is the love-child of [i]Risk[/i] and [i]Axis & Allies[/i].

10. Tight map, with all players at each others' throats immediately.

11. Sea movement is more important than in most games of this breed.

12. Each event card and treasure card and monster tile is unique. That's nice.

13. All the treasure cards are named after legendary magic items I can recall from my veteran D&D campaigns: Hand of Vecna, Holy Avenger, and Staff of the Magi, etc.

14. There's a giant spider! Tick that box, please.

15. All the the monster tiles have dice and abilities that [i]feel[/i] right (difficult to explain to non-geeks): 2-headed giant rolls 2d12. Hydra rolls 3d8, orc horde rolls 4d6, etc.

16. All of the different faction models roll varying numbers and types of dice - with abilities and movement to match their race. Simple but effective.

17. Has a decent team option, and a sliding scale of VPs if players want a long, medium, or short game experience. We recommend the short game, or medium game if you want to play all evening (which we don't), or the long game if you want to play for days...

18. The game's a [i]huge[/i] dice-fest and needs extra dice (from your old D&D Expert set days) added.

19. There seemed like there was no runaway leader problems, with each player within striking distance of a win - that's the beauty of a VP system compared to a conquer all spaces objective.


[b]I'll fiddle with my twiddle and diddle with the middle and make a magic riddle that'll turn the giant little.[/b]


1. Turn threading, in some form, might have been terrific here, saving us all from the sin of downtime.

2. The dragons need flight bases. It's simply unseemly for a dragon model to scuttle about the board on its belly. Scaled or not, it just won't do!

3. Maybe not enough castle models. Time will tell...

4. No art on the treasure or event cards. Not a problem really, just a nice to have. The monster tiles do, however, have nice pieces of art on them depicting ancient dragons and green slimes and other nasties.

5. The game's a [i]huge[/i] dice-fest and needs extra dice (from your old D&D Expert set days) added.

6. Woeful player handouts. Each player really should have a matrix describing the capabilities and cost of each unit.

7. It is the smart child of [i]Axis & Allies[/i], maybe a cousin of [i]Risk[/i].

Components are very good.  Decent enough fantasy empire game ala old MB Gamemasters Ameritrash.  Would have preferred the factions to be more asymmetric.  The only real differences are starting strength and the event decks.  While many of the units have different names, they are the same.  Would have preferred if the factions' units had some individual abilities.  The game is pretty similar to Warparty although the dungeon exploring is less annoying here.  Has one of the best designed box inserts.

If you want a light fix of wargaming with some fantasy it'll do the job very nicely. Not much depth but a reasonable amount of strategy and some replayability. By no means a perfect game but I've given it a good rating because it's just a nice all round, empire building, fantasy wargame fix in a box. This was what I really wanted when I bought Catan and I think for most new boardgamers who just don't have the time for Warhammer anymore and want a bit of a geek off at a get together, it does the job nicely.

Relatively straightforward 'multiple paths to victory points' Euro.  The push-your-luck action card mechanic and exactly the right (small) amount of randomness, however, make this engaging and a current favorite.

A themeless euro cube-pusher....which doesn't prevent it from being a marvelous and agonizingly tense game! Sort of the gamer's version of a Color/Zoolo/Aquaretto type of game.
I may be a lone voice in the wilderness, I admit, but I found the iconography on the boards not very clear.

Play a quadrillion eurogames and it becomes really difficult for a new one to impress.  "Ah, yes" you say "selecting rows of cards as in Coloretto, with programmed actions as in Robo Rally" and then move on to the next one.  Inotaizu pulls off the rare trick of assembling familiar mechanics in a fresh way.  

At heart is that Coloretto-ish system of placing cards in rows and then selecting a row as yours.  But Inotaizu further complicates matters by having actions on the cards so that their order in the row is important.  Another clever wrinkle is that actions are resolved in column order, so I take the first action in my row, you take the first in yours and so on.  Hence, not only is position in a row significant, so is position vis a vis all the other cards. This is not a game to play with those prone to analysis paralysis. The other systems mesh together pretty well and give you plenty to think about.

The theme of mapping Japan is an original one and although the mechanics are fairly abstracted, nothing jars with it.  The artwork is quite pleasing, particularly the box lid.  Overall production quality is better than decent for a small company, with only a flimsy box inlay disappointing.  I found the English rules included in the original Japanese edition easy to read, although they don't cover every detail.

Version Note: Inotaizu (Takamagahara First Edition)

Very nice and challenging game.  The mechanisms in the game are solid and work well.  Each turn is a struggle to build a good set of cards that you want but not so tempting to your opponents.  Of course, knowing when to seize their sets is as key (maybe more!) and thus you'll find yourself second guessing yourself and your opponents and second guessing your second guesses.  The game's production quality is nice as well (although my copy was missing the first player tile).  Good game.

Interesting mechanic in how you play cards to a number of rows in turn and then can take on of the rows of cards to be your own to use for actions / points etc. but notwithstanding the decisions made there and notwithstanding the element of luck in which areas have additional workers placed, the final scorig appears to be enough to make up any disparity in scores up to that point. Or maybe thats cos we'd forgotten what the final scoring elements were.

RATING: 7
This one is deceptively simple on the surface, but there is so much thinking that it can hurt the head.

Tons of planning. You really have to think out the order of actions.

The best aspect of the game is the unique seeding of actions, and claiming a row of actions that includes cards played by others.

One questionable aspect is how tight money is. Almost seems too tight. And resetting the money makes it even more brutally difficult.

Update from Nov 2010 to July 2012. 7.5 to 7.0

The seeding is interesting. But after a few plays, a few things are scripted. You save the surveyor placement card for yourself. And the 2 cube placement cards for yourself. Otherwise, the other cards are dispensable. 

Something about the economy of the game feels off. Cannot see how anyone could ever afford to spend 10/20/30 ryos to place 2/4/6 cubes. Resetting the government track at the end of round 4 doesn't feel quite right.

RATING: 6
Initial review:  Shows promise.   I really like the Colereto model, because it forces some interesting greed vs certainty decisions.

We played the game wrong the first time, so it felt a little off, and I suspect that the way we played also inflated map-scores far more than they should have.   That would have made strategies earning points in manners other than that like I used a lot more viable.

So, we'll call it a 6 for now, and hope that it improves when we play with the right rules.

Like a be bop riff on an old melody, this takes the painfull choice mechanism at the heart of Coloretto and twists it in interesting ways - reducing the randomness, as you play the cards to be chosen from your hand, and increasing the complexity, as the interaction of the cards goes beyond set collection. A shame the theme is only tacked on but very impressed on first play and looking forward to trying again soon.

RATING: 6
Kaigan itself is pretty simple and abstract: the hard work of doing the trigonometry calculations necessary for the surveyors to do their job is abstracted to collecting enough ‘work’ until the job is done. So the really interesting part is in working out the effect of all actions lying in a row, and then contemplating whether or not it would make sense to add to a row, or to claim one. This part of the game is not easy, and perhaps, ultimately, too chaotic and uncontrollable, but it makes for a good brain-burning exercise just the same. There are some unwritten do's and dont's you can follow here, and once you have them in your grasp, the game becomes, blissfully, a little easier.

My partner and I enjoyed ourselves while playing Kaigan at Spiel 2010, but were held back from a purchase by the very high price of €35. And when we replayed the game some time later we were informed that the game had sold out in the meantime. Ouch. Such is the price of waiting...

RATING: 4
Components: Standard meeples; wooden cubes; good quality cards; huge, chunky round marker. Thematically, this game just doesn't work for me. I never felt like I was surveying Japan's coast; the coast tiles were significant only for their symbols, and therefore had no relation to each other. Furthermore, all of the action cards featuring meeples or cubes felt completely abstract to me.

Experience: I really enjoy this use of the Coloretto mechanic, in which players must add to rows of cards that some other player might then claim. The added ability to claim a row in the same turn that one added to it is enjoyable. I also like the top-to-bottom, left-to-right execution order; the ability to turn cards over for a generic placement action; and the cards pre-printed on the board.

This game has only a small element of pushing cubes around, in that I must first get a meeple onto a tile, and then that meeple may place cubes on the tile, but it's enough that I found it difficult to comprehend a strategy. The game feels balanced, including all the different ways to score and get money (money is very tight), but just not my type of game.

RATING: 5
Kaigan is the reprint of a small run Japanese game, Inotaizu, that is thematically centered on the mapping of the coastline of Japan. While the theme isn't particularly strong, it is fairly tight, there is nothing you do that doesn't make sense thematically within the context of the game. 

The game's central mechanic is one where each player takes turns alternatively placing cards in one of four rows (or three with that many players), and choosing whether to claim that row, thus preventing them from placing any further cards, or continuing on. This goes on until each player has claimed a row. After this occurs, the actions act in a specific order based on where they are placed on the board, with actions giving money, advancing tracks that give some combination of victory points and money, and effecting the map tiles which represent the coast of Japan.

There are more little details to it, but that central mechanic is what I think is the biggest selling point for the game, at least in my mind. The interesting incentive management that comes from making offers through card play really makes the entire card placement fascinating, and I expect it will only grow more so with experienced players.

Unfortunately further play indicated that the central mechanic was not sufficient to ensure long term interest. I sold my copy after my second play.

Solid game that combines a number of very familiar mechanisms into a workable game.   The mapping of tiles is a little bit like Blue Moon City (mainly in look and feel) but the core of the game is laying action cards into a matrix and then choosing one of the rows for your actions that round.  There is some similarity to Coloretto in this mechanic, but the pre-printed action spaces makes for an interesting wrinkle. It works pretty well, and it's the core engine driving this game. The filling in of map tiles with neutral cubes via dice rolls is another nice wrinkle to consider.   Farmland scoring seems to be powerful, but if everyone is aware of that, it should be self-balancing.  This game should make a nice reprint/reissue.

Think Coloretto only with actions. You play cards in rows and can only choose one row of action cards to activate and they have to be activated in the order they're laid down. Tight, tense game of planning and brinkmanship on which set of cards you take. I like it enough to play occasionally, though this kind of thinky abstract is not my favorite type of game.

In Inotaizu players help to survey Japan, earning victory points in the process. To do that they need actions that allow them to place surveyors, earn money, and so on. Generally speaking those actions are certainly not breaking any new ground. The way players get access to them, however, is what makes the game special.

Each player has an identical set of action cards. Players place one card each in a grid and continue to do so until either the grid is full (which doesn't happen often) or one of the rows looks enticing enough for one of the players to claim it. When all players have claimed a row that way the actions available in those rows are executed in the order they were placed in.

The card grid offers lots of interesting choices. You want to offer incentives for other players to stay away from the row you want but you don't want to make their rows too useful, either. In order to make sure that you get access to certain actions you may have to claim a row early but that means you'll have fewer actions available this turn. If you wait too long, however, someone else may claim it instead. And, of course, you also need those actions to be in a certain order. Trying to survey land without having placed any surveyors first most likely won't work out.

Delicious!

First! Any game with "compornants" has my attention. Action-rific!

Initial rating after one play. Inotaizu reminds me a bit of San Marco. Both games revolve around splitting up and choosing game benefits. But San Marco has limit cards that effectively sully up the benefits they're grouped with. Inotaizu has no such defiler cards -- everything you have to offer is good in one way or another. In this sense, it's a game about being magnanimous without overdoing it. Minimum essential generosity. So very Japanese!

Great theme and great mechanism! The game itself is less interesting, but still a good one. Also, the main mechanism is what the game is about, so it's all fine.

Even though the game comes with dice, you can ignore the phase where they are used in to avoid the completely unnecessary randomness. Someone must have been very drunk when they decided to put this into the game.

RATING: 7.25
This is a nice, quick-flowing Euro, with an unusual theme that pretty much works and which, after a 1st play 3-player solo game to get the feel, seems to play pretty evenly and competitively.

This has an action building phase that reminds me of the set building mechanism from Coloretto- try to assemble a set of actions which are good for you, but not so good that others take it first (unless you want their set more).

After the actions are built and chosen, each palyers takes their actions, either grabbing Artistic or Political status, taking Points or money directly, or placing Surveyors and using them to map the coastline of Japan.  This latter action can award one or more of the above, with the exception of money, but it doesn't produce until the job is done, taking 2-4 efforts.

Also, Tadataka Ino, the famous cartographer may 'help' you in mapping the coastline, randomly helping up to three areas per turn.  This either assists in finished sections, or it prevents you from securing the whole reward for the tile in question- it can be either a positive or a negative.

All of this accumulates as status (the Japanese for 'VP', in this game).

It's got a lot of tough decisions, but it doesn't make you think so hard about them that it slows the pace of play much.

So on a first solo play, this quick medium weight Euro gets a 7, but a nice-playing game with a good theme and artwork, as well as a quick tempo make this a likely climber for me.

Raised to 7.25 after 4 plays; this game plays smoothly and quickly, and the elements really flow together, even with the somewhat agonizing choices of the action-building phase.  Definitely recommended!

I see I'm not the first person to make the San Marco connection here.  Divvying up the rows here feels very much like the you-cut-I-choose part of that game, and it works amazingly well with multiple players.  This is where the meat of the game is and makes for both subtle and agonizing decisions.  The rest of the game is more basic and feels a bit old fashioned perhaps, but the part where you fill the grid with cards is good enough that it can carry the game.

The theme of Kaigan is cartography: you are sending out surveyors to make a map of the coast of Japan. This is an absolutely brilliant theme, and though the game is only lightly themed, it's a very clever idea.  It's a combination card drafting/ area control game, both mechanics I like.  The drafting allows you to either play a card to a row or take a row of cards in a slightly Coloretto-esque fashion, something I haven't seen much in this sort of game, while the area control is almost along the lines of Blue Moon City -- winning is good, but mostly you don't want to be left out.  Combine that with some interesting timing issues for players to figure out and a high degree of interaction, and this is quite an interesting game. Fun. (1 play)

Solid design (only minor complaints like presence of actions which are never used (like these for 10/20/30 ryo)).  But - I didn't feel anything revolutionary.  Even original card matrix, which you fill with cards for you and your opponents, failed to excite me.  I really appreciate this concept, but it was not enough to incite my admiration of the game.  Other elements are not-so-fresh.

But as I wrote at the beginning - solid game, just short of being an excellent one.

Was told this game's core mechanism was like "Coloretto" but it's actually almost nothing like that mechanism though it's easy to see why on the surface it may sound like that.

Everyone has an identical set of action cards and each player adds one of them to one of the rows in an empty spot (there is the same number as the number of players) but then can also claim any unclaimed row (after which you are done until everyone has claimed a row).  Each row also has one or two actions that are printed right on the board.  The actions are resolved *column* by column (and from top to bottom) so order matters.

There is another board with random tiles that you use actions to get meeples on which then allows you to add your cubes to.  Tiles require from 2 to 4 cubes and players can cooperate.  Completing tiles gets everyone with at least one cube there victory points as well as influence on one of 3 tracks that generate income and/or victory points.  Cubes are also possibly added randomly (via dice rolls) at the end of each of the 5 rounds.

A brainburner but a good one at this. Don't be deceived by the first perception that this is simply another accumulation of rehashed euro game mechanisms and ten different ways to gather VPs. The core is a grid of 4x5 action spaces to program your and the other players actions for the round. The unique twist is that no row belongs to one player until he claims it but once he does he will play the actions other players have played there as well in the next phase. The challenge is to create rows that are attractive for you but not so attractive that other players will claim them before you. A unique eurogame from Japan worth owning and I'm glad that I took the plunge buying it at Spiel 2010 without playing it before. I chose to purchase one of the few available copies of the original Japanese Inotaizu version as its design is more convincing and true to its theme than the pseudo-Asian design of the Kaigan reprint.

I appreciate the game for its novel theme, even if it is blatantly pasted on.  I haven't played Inotaizu, but the use of the paper map in Kaigan, however thematic it might be, just seems wrong.  I disliked it in Vegas Showdown, it also detracts from the enjoyment of the game here.

As everyone says, the Coloretto-like element of the game is fun, and because of the ordering of actions, carries a little more tension.  I also like the mix of during game and end game scoring - it's not that easy to tell who's leading, which I suppose could lead to some awkward kingmaking issues from time to time.

Still, any length over an hour simply feels too long.  Our first play was really too long, I forgot to time the second.  But anything over an hour would be too much.

A coloretto style game with area control added in. Basically players add action cards to a row and claim the row if they want. If you wait too long, you run the risk of another player stealing the row you want. The action cards allow players to add cubes to claim territories.

Very straightforward and simple. The game would be miles better if players chose to EITHER add a card OR claim a row.

Fascinating game with a mishmash of mechanics that work rather uniquely together.  In some ways, players are working together to map Japan, but also you are competing against each other in mapping regions and gaining benefits associated with that particular tile. Initially it feels a bit like Coloretto with playing of cards to rows and claiming a row which determines your actions in this case.  Actions are done in a particular order and then you send assistants out (assuming that card was part of the row you claimed) and map the tiles so to speak.  Points and currency are earned several different ways.

If it only would have a map of Japan where you could lay the 'discovered' tiles it wouldn't feel so abstract.

But all players (including me) were very enthusiastic after the first game anyway. Despite only having 6 cards to play it seems there are many different strategies/tactics possible.

Gameplay feels fresh. It's probably the best new 'indirect put plenty of interaction' game I've played in the last 2 years. Especially the first phase of each round feels very tense.

RATING: 8
The back end of this game, with surveyor meeples and wooden cubes, is fairly ordinary, although hard to analyze accurately (a good thing).  The front-end mechanism, on the other hand, is fiendishly clever. Players contribute cards to a board layout to create the action sequence of each round.  The challenge is to balance your card play between setting up (or capturing from the board) what you want and making a row too valuable for another player to pass up.  The tension created by the interplay of these two mechanisms is deliciously painful.  The faux-Japanese artwork is very attractive and adds to the texture of the game.

Just ok. At the upper limit of my brain burning tolerance. Like the card mechanic. Nice graphics generally. Don't like the very tight resources. A bit claustrophobic. Needs Score chits to map territory and a proper map of japan on a mounted board.

Don't have a solid idea of the game, but you choose actions and try to complete different map sections with pieces you play down. There is a neutral player that adds pieces to the board and can help finish maps, but does not add points when scoring.

Looks OK.

It's always the indie crowd, isn't it?  Amidst all the hype surrounding big box releases like Small World, a tiny little publisher produces the underground hit of 2010.

Kaigan is a textbook case of a game where the mechanics tie in so perfectly with the theme, they fade into the background.  The game concept (the classic, successful attempt to map Japan's coastline) is one you've never seen before and won't see again.  And the "worker placement" style auctions are neither auctions nor worker placement, but combine into a weird and very tense decision each round about your limited actions and the proper time to pull the trigger.

Simply put, this game is a lot of fun.  Get it now before it goes out of print.  And keep an eye on Ascora Games -- they're not FFG, Days of Wonder, or RGG, and thank God for that.

players place their action cards in rows and pick a row of cards almost coloretto-style, once all rows are picked players execute the actions in card order. unfortunately the actions are not interesting, they allow VP collection in small increments.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First impression (3 players): Overall pretty abstract game with pretty unique way how to select actions. Players first play action cards (6 different) onto rows where there is room for 5 actions (with at least 1 predetermined) and then can either lock one row for himself (and is out of this phase of the game) or can wait for later time to select row (which might turn out better or worse). After that actions are played out in order they are on rows (but alternating players) so you can influence other players game more or less directly.

I really liked this mechanic itself although it easily can turn into huge analysis-paralysis if players are into it because you need to (or can) think so many things during this phase. Because of way it works I think 3 players is better for the game than 4 (2 works well probably but I don't personally like) since there is less chaos then.

RATING: 7
With its great theme (Japanese cartography!) and unusual mechanics, Kaigan really stands out as different.  Each player takes turns laying action cards on a grid, determining not only when the action will take place, but also which player will take that action.  However, the player's identity won't be known until that player claims a row of action cards, which you can do earlier to secure the right combination of actions, or later to get more actions.  The main scoring mechanism is area control, but the order of actions matters, as regions can fill up before you get a chance to place there.  There were definitely subtle interactions at play here, but it felt difficult to have much control over the action drafting.

This game has a wonderful mechanic of doing actions, different players play their action cards on a grid until one player claims the actions in a row (it could be anyone's card though, ordinary game of a bit of area control and a bit of economy, but this unique mechanic really stands out.

RATING: 9
Players send out surveyors to map Japan's coastline. Fill a board with action cards, claim a row of actions, then execute them in columns so that players alternate turns. During the five rounds progress is made on a main victory point line and three important secondary lines. Actions usually cost money and managing expenses, income, and progress on all the different tracks requires a bit of a mental juggling act.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a great game! At first you plan by placing a card on the board. After placing you may claim a row of action cards. Every player gets one row of action cards to be executed in the placed order.
And this is where the game can be mean. Somebody else can claim the row that you tried to build up. And you might end up with a less favorable row. It is the dilemma of take now or hope for better.
Then you send out your workers or get them to work. And the completed work gets you points and or income.

The game is Japanese and nearly abstract. Those two go fine together. I really enjoyed playing Kaigan and it is a pity the game is hard to obtain.

RATING: 9.25
An outstanding game that has flown under the radar. Players are surveyors competing to map the coast of Japan at the start of the 19th century. Hints of Zooloretto (i.e. placing tiles, or in this case action cards, in a set that could be "selected" or stolen by another player) -- but the brilliance in this design is that the cards are played in order by column, while players each select a *row*, making placement decisions agonizing because they impact turn order, and therefore projected opportunity based on relative timing of each action. Worker placement and action selection at its core, with balancing of power tracks, victory points, and money. The two things I didn't like were the dice rolls for neutral surveyors (this could add too much luck, but shouldn't make the game), and the paper map. Great game!

--Feb2011-- Interesting game of indirect placement and scoring.  The game has a lovely unpillaged theme.  It's not spectacular, but is solid.
--Sep2013-- Traded for _Hacienda_.
--Jan2017-- I'd love to reacquire this - or, more precisely, to find a copy of _Inotaizu_ - since it's quite charming.  Content to play others' copies for the moment.

This plays fast and does some different things with the area control concept - usually not one of my favorites.  Three tracks can be used for income and points and the order that the cards are laid in determine the order of actions.  Not intuitive on explanation, but once you start playing, things fall into place quite easily.  Solid little game.

Nálam a 2013-as őszi CON játéka díjat kapná a Kaigan, méghozzá az eredetisége miatt. Nem igazán tudom mihez hasonlítani. Mindenki ugyanolyan akciókártyákkal teríti be a 5x4 helyet magába foglaló pályát. Egy kártya lerakása után egy sort lefoglalva választhatja ki milyen akciókat hajt végre. Azaz egymásnak pakoljuk le az akciókat, cél jó időben jó sort választva megfelelő akciókat végrehajtani. Az akciók egyszerűek. Japán térképre helyezünk le földmérő figurákat és kockákat. Ezzel győzelmi pontot szerzünk, illetve három sávon haladhatunk előre. Ezen sávok pontot és pénzt hoznak különböző formában a játék során. A játék fix körös, egyszerűen elmondható szabályú, mégis mély játék. Belekötni csak a konfliktusságába tudok, de első játék alkalmával nem igazán jött ki mennyire fajulhat ez el. Nagyon erős 7-es.

Half of the game is an inspired take on Coloretto, the other half a mediocre area majority game; the two halves are fused together competently enough. Kaigon is one of those euros that's more focused on mechanics and edging out a win with opportunistic play. It's a bit dry, but there's a good amount of interaction. The trouble is, the best strategy is fairly obvious.

We got a major rule wrong that punished long-term play and would have added more tension to the game.  Still had fun and I can see my rating going up on future plays as I like the Coloretto-ish aspect, which is at the heart of the game.  Hope it hits the table again soon.

RATING: N/A
Kaigan is a cool game about cartography in Japan. How odd can that be?! It really works very well and I like the game. It has the action selection taken from coloretto and a area majority mechanism. The interaction is heavy, the time of play is the same as in a good filler but Kaigan is a stand alone game far from being just a filler. I like Japan themed games (or anything about Japan, sort of speaking) and this game although very abstract and not much themed, it adds some cool rules related to the theme. Overall, a very good medium game.

The (excellent) hook is the 'Zooloretto/San Marco essque' action selection. 

The rest is pleasant enough, place cubes, go up tracks, score during and at end of game. Quirky and interesting theme that does not fit with mechanics, at least its not set in Venice.

RATING: 6.5
This is good enough to play, but it's difficult to tell from the first try whether it will hit the table repeatedly.  The business about contributing cards from identical hands to an action board and then each player claiming one of the lines of action thus constructed is interesting, but not (so far, at least) especially interesting.  The small element of dice-rolling feels a bit incongruous.  Maybe Kaigan is not really as subtle as we're trying to treat it.

RATING: 8
A novel take on area-influence from a Japanese small publisher.

Themed around mapping the Japanese coast one section at a time. Players compete to contribute to each section. As sections are completed, points are earned on tracks which bring VP, income, or a mixture. Getting influence in a section requires an assistant, then spending cash. Moving assistants requires cash. Doing anything requires actions obtained through a card-placing scheme that feels like a cross between Zooloretto and San Marco: players start each round with identical decks of action cards, and take it in turns to place a card on any free space in a 4x5 grid, and may claim a row after placing. Actions are then performed in column order (so players alternate actions). This card placement can be a little brain-burning, and has AP potential.

With a Coloretto-like action auction and a simple area-control mechanic fused together, Kaigan somehow seems greater than its simple parts. The game is engaging and the card-drafting decisions, especially, are interesting and challenging. The Japanese coastline area-control portion of the game is a bit dull, but works fine. I like the game art, but wish that Japan coastal map had a mounted board rather than being just paper (apparently a decision by the publisher to keep the cost of a non-essential game element down - I would rather have paid a little more for the game and gotten top-quality components). However, Kaigan works well and the pluses far outweigh the quibbles I've listed. Probably will never rise beyond a 7 rating for me, but Kaigan is pretty solid and I look forward to future plays.

Kaigan is a gamer's game that two publishers have struggled to execute.  The programming board, with actions selected in rows but executed in columns, is brilliant.  It's a triumph in a genre defined by robots moving on a grid.    But Kaigan's area control map--half the game--is hard to score and the only player aid uses simulated Japanese on a garish seascape.  Disaster.  Kaigan would gain 2 points if properly republished (again).

The Coloretto mechanic set on this scale is attractively themed. This may be an unfair rating, but I suspect it's dynamics gets undermined by the pointing and those different tracks, it separates us & overcomplicates the lovely map & Coloretto card row selection (which IS pretty awesome).

I could be way wrong. I played long ago, if I play again I will be open, because I've changed and it might be cool.

This game incorporates elements of the Schacht bidding mechanism found in Coloretto or Zooloretto series. Either play a card or claim a row. The only difference is that the claiming of a row can happen after playing a card. However, with some minor tweak in the rules, one can play with the more brutal Schacht version of the rules.

Once cards have been played, actions are taken in player order and players move surveyors around the different coastal tiles to map the region. Luck comes in the form of Tadataka Ino randomly  helping different surveyors (via rolling dice) by contributing his cartographic skills toward completion of mapping a tile. If you are lucky, then his help will come at a crucial time to complete a tile. Scoring then occurs in multiple tracks depending on the type of tile mapped. Overall, players enjoyed the game with the only beef being the points awarded for the "travel" track. It was thought that 8 points for the leader was way too much since that tile already conferred points during interim scoring.

Not a bad effort by a Japanese designer.

*VERY* clever action selection mechanism. There's an element of "you place / I choose" where you need to create a set of cards which is advantageous to you but not good enough for someone else to choose.

Other than that, it's an interesting, but not really remarkable, game. Resources (money) is tight, which is nice.

Very interesting game. With all players filling the action card tableau one card at a time and you have the option of taking a row at any time, this is the best part of the game. Take a row early and let others fill it with less inviting stuff or wait and try to load it up. Having said that I still did not enjoy the game that much.

Strong game mechanic that creates much tension and difficult decision making. The resolution, and hence planning, can be a little confusing at first. Replayability may be on the low side. Player interaction is relatively high, albeit mostly indirect. Artwork is fine. Game components quality is ok, but it is strange to have the two boards made up of different material, i.e. cardboard vs thick paper.

Pretty decent train/stock holding game masked with an out-of-left-field theme.  Really, that's the worst part here: it doesn't make any sense to the mechanics.  Sure, the art is lovely, but it's hard to lose yourself in something like this.  The mechanics are nothing new, but they are well-polished here.

Spectaculum is a stock trading game.  Shares come in four colours, representing different circus troupes, although the theming is paper thin.  On their turn a player places three randomly drawn pieces to extend the routes of the troupes.  When a route reaches a village the troupe's share value is adjusted up or down, or there is an immediate payout or expense.  Up to two shares can be bought or sold before or after routes are extended.  

Within this simple framework there is surprising scope for clever play in the timing of sales and purchases, in shielding profitable villages from colours you have no interest in, in inflicting expenses on opponents when they are short of cash, and in timing the end of the game. All this and the game plays quickly and smoothly too.

Production quality is decent and the rules are well-written.  Spectaculum provides further evidence that Pegasus wastes no money on artistic talent.

A lighter Knizia stock market game with a bit of a bland theme that screams to be left on the shelf. Not bad but not particularly memorable. Buy it so it can sit on your shelf for ten years between plays.

With Spectaculum and its companion release Qin, I heard that Knizia was back to involved gamers' games in 2012.
I found one at super cheap price, and I didn't resist the temptation...
Well, Spectaculum is quite light fare for a gamers' game!
In Spectaculum is a quintessential "buy low, sell high" game, where players invest in circus troupes, while moving four different traveling circuses around in the country (with every visited town modifying the visiting circus' value).
The game is very fast (you can play it in 15 minutes with 2 players!) and quite enjoyable for what it is: a possible introduction to the genre for new players, or a quick filler for gamers.

Much more fun that I thought it would be! I picked this up for $10 at the ding and dent booth R&R games had at Dice Tower Con 2016. I usually like Knizia games. Looking at the box and the components, however, my enthusiasm waned. It just doesn't look that exciting. However, do not judge a game by it's box! This is great! Spectaculum is basically a light stock game where you buy and sell "performers" (shares) of 4 color "circuses" (companies) while putting out discs of the 4 colors trying to raise and lower the values of those companies. Our 3 player game was very nasty as we lowered the values of the circuses that the other players had performers in. Final scores; 81,80, 76. Keeper!

A játék jó, de számomra száraz és nyers. Tőzsde jellegű játék, melyet egy egyedi megoldással valósítottak meg. Nekem semelyikkel nincs problémám, csak inkább a döntési lehetőségek szűkkörűségét hiányolom. Inkább olyanoknak ajánlom, akik szeretnek sokat előre gondolkodni. A grafika jó és kártyák minőségére sem lehet panasz. Egyedi kinézete van.

RATING: 7
I tend to like stock market games more than the average guy, so maybe my rating for this is in light of that.

In Spectaculum, you get to trade stock, and also influence the price of the stock by placing chips on a map.  The map consists of a bunch of spaces.  Some are empty, and some contain various modifiers which trigger changes in stock prices or trigger dividends.  On your turn, you'll get to place 3 randomly drawn chips, which must be adjacent to other previously placed chips of that stock color.  If a chip is placed on a modifier space, that modifier occurs.

Some people will dislike the random chip draw, as often you won't get chips to modify the stocks you really care about.  But, I thought the unpredictability made sense for a stock game and really didn't mind.

Overall, a really neat twist on the stock trading genre, and one that's worth playing if you like that sort of thing.

Knizia rarely dissapoints. Super simple game to teach
and requested by many. Theme is of course slapped on ,
but the flow and tension of the game is excellent. Can
see this being pulled out once in awhile. 

Multiplayer games play very differently than two player games. In multiplayer you have to rely on others to jack
up the price of performers. While two player games are an all out battle of wits and push your luck contests.

Marvelous little stock market game (strangely themed on traveling circuses measured by their popularity).  Basically a mix up of games such as Durch die Wueste, Chicago Express, Paris Connection, Shark ... but constrained to 30 minutes and better for it.  A gem.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quick, simple game that has some fun aspects. I think that a few rule changes might make the decisions more interesting. I think that drawing the disks randomly doesn't appeal to me in a stock market game. Also, it might be more tense if any stocks you held at the end of the game didn't count, forcing you to decide when to start selling. Mostly, Mary didn't like the fact that values could go down so dramatically. I found that thematic, but also also a little frustrating when combined with the random disk draws.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a clever representation of the stock market.  I like the way you have a little bit of private information on which to base decisions.  However, you have fewer decisions to make as the game progresses and the board gets locked down.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The random tile placement at the beginning creates an interesting landscape of risk that you must traverse and predict how others will traverse. The random disc draws and ability to trade only 2 shares sometimes seem a bit too limiting—you may occasionally feel like you can't accomplish anything that helps your position. Instead, you need to think about the total effect of your moves on the relative differences between players, and preparing for your shares to be adjusted by others. The endgame lacks a climax. Since all your shares pay out at the end, there's dwindling risk if the last few turns only let you eke out a few more points. It would be more exciting if your big investments weren't completely guaranteed until the final moment.

Despite these quirks, the game is mechanically solid, player-driven, properly short, and interesting.

RATING: 6.5
A typical Reiner Knizia game which feels like a classic German game from the 1990s [/size]

There is much talk on BGG that Reiner Knizia has lost his mojo.  But I am not so sure as I think it is as much a change in the tastes of modern boardgaming as a reduction in his abilities.  [thing=18932][/thing] is classic Knizia and could easily have come out in 1997, when he was in his full glory, producing game after game of simple, elegant design.
 
Really this is a stocks and shares game, I am not sure why the publisher gave it a ludicrous veneer of a travelling circus.  You buy stocks and make their price go up, you sell them before they go down. Their price is determined by the placement of discs on the board.  

It is clever, quick, and engaging.  Worth 30 minutes of anybody’s time and rather unjustly often found in the bargain bins.

Tetszett a bemutató videók alapján, de még ehhez képest is kellemes meglepetés ért vele kapcsolatban. Knizia nem sokat kombinált: összerakta a botswanat (vagy a 20 klónja egyikét) az át a sivatagonnal. Nagyon bejött ez az elsőre pofátlannak tűnő húzás. A szabály 5 perc alatt bárkinek tanítható, a játék kb. 45 percig tart, mégis tartalmas, és tele van nehéz döntésekkel. Az ellenfelek figyelése, és a fejükkel való gondolkodás is igen fontos. Erre jön rá némi szerencse szerep a húzásnál, de ez csökkenthető az expert szabályokkal.
Szerintem az egyik legjobb knizia, és véleményem szerint nagyon alul van értékelve.

Two plays back to back in one sitting.   Not enough options, which means if you get screwed by the order in which things occur or a poor draw or two, you really can't recover.  Incremental and very tactical, dominated by luck.  Three strikes and you are out.

Wow. Very good!
Classic RK - you feel like the game was designed same time as let's say Through the Desert. Same kind of obvious designs that noone done before.

Overview card design is perfect.

On the con side:
The game drags a bit at the end.

RATING: 4
Although I love a lot of Knizia’s earlier games and can see the merits in some of his more recent releases Spectaculum isn’t one of them. The game feels very repetitive, not helped by the unvaried and unimaginative events. The ending is also anti-climatic it is all too easy to resort to following the leader in terms of what shares to buy and sell and then just waiting out the final few turns until final scoring.

If you hanker for a woozy feeling of déjà vu then pig-out on candy floss, it will work out cheaper and you will have much more fun.

The closest comparison is Paris Connection, and this game shows how dull Paris Connection is. Here, your choices are more constrained, which helps the game move along a bit. More fun than Paris Connection. Holdings are visible, but that doesn't drag the game down because your movement is determined by which chips you draw.

RATING: 7
This game is light, quick and somewhat fun.

It won't break any records, and you won't jump through the roof, it's nothing great, but it's fun. It is shallow but somewhat replayable because of the setup and random draw.

The stock market is more or less unpredictable, but sometimes you can see a tendency. This game reflects that. The more of one colour that comes out, the more of the others will come out later in the game. Also, the more negatives have been chosen, the more positives will be available later in the game.

Nicely thought.

This game could have been the foundation of a larger game, where players own something and try to make some money on top of having this stock market like game in it. Would have made a really great game. :)

I would accept it as a present, but will never buy it unless I can get it for 10$ used.

RATING: 5
I am a Knizia fan, and do not agree that his themes are always pasted on, but this game was a disappointment, despite my best efforts to like it.

Too light to be light-medium and too tedious to be light. Despite the randomness of the disc draws, and being slightly math-oriented, this game lacks any real "fun" factor, at least for me, despite a valiant attempt at pasting on a vivid theme and artwork.

As others have pointed out, the game effectively ends before the end-of-game trigger, due to everyone having sold their stock, often with no price manipulation tiles remaining.

Just did not work for me. Maybe works as a family game to teach kids speculation and routing, if they are math-oriented, but fail to see the gamer appeal, even as a filler. If you really enjoy stock market games and routing, then perhaps it would work for you.

This is a proper euro-game with surprisingly often painful choices and possibly too little control (even in the advanced variant).

Is another rehash of an earlier Knizia title "Buy Low Sell High" but instead of using cards to control stock prices you use a board with a snake like playing of wooden discs onto cardboard chits that change prices (or cause dividends or reverse dividends)

RATING: 6
Light, interesting share management and network building game that feels reminiscent of Paris Connection with a random set up and a few extra rules. (It's still mechanically very simple, 'tho).

The old adage of 'buy low, sell high' works well here, with players trying to build the value of companies in which they have a significant stake while reducing value of companies held by others - at least to the point where you can buy them cheap!

Unlike Paris Connection, there are also opportunities for screwing/rewarding holders of shares in a particular company regardless of that share's worth.

RATING: 6.5
The mechanism is good, it's true Knizia; I just didn't have as much fun as I hoped for the first time so I needed to play it more. Then I found out the solution: DO NOT PLAY THE ADVANCED VERSION! The advanced rule is seemingly not a big deal and even makes the luck factor smaller, but in practice it makes the game last way longer than it should. It's a fine 30-minute game; for twice the length (the advanced version often lasts about 60) it is lacking.

Otherwise:
I thought Stephensons Rocket was Acquire meets Through the Desert. But this one is also Acquire meets Through the Desert, although it's not only lighter than SR (closer to Acquire and TTD) but there is one thing clearly missing from the ingredients: merging (look for Acquire-like merging in Qin, the other Knizia/Eggertspiele Fall 2012 release). Instead of merging you get TTD-like blocking, but at the same time unlike TTD or SR, it's far from a no-luck game. You have 3 tiles (tokens) in 4 colors to place out of 4 (advanced version) which makes the game tactical in a T&E/Acquire way as your moves are quite much dictated by the tile/token draw. This makes the game quite luck-dependent which is all right for a 30-minute, light stock market game which even has some interesting decisions.

A Reiner Knizia game where you place travel tokens to move a traveling circus to different locations to either increase the amount people will pay to see the circus.  You can buy and sell entertainers which are effectively stocks since the game is a light stock game. 

It is deeper than it appears on the surface.  It is not the greatest game I have played but I enjoyed the game and will keep it.  Airlines Europe is much more clever but also is heavier and longer than this.

RATING: 7
A recent Knizia (which, apart from Qin, has become a synonym for fillers that are rip-offs of previous game and are not worthwile playing and certainly not owning) + low rating, made of low expectations. 
Most of us however were pleasantly surprised by this game that is still a filler (typically a small ruleset and short playing time), but in whom you have the feeling that your decissions matter. But to make things clear: we immediately played by the 'more strategic'-variant, were you can draw 4 markers instead of just 3.

RATING: 6
I'm always interested to try a new Knizia - I think I'm up to 50 now! From reading the rules, the spatial stock-market of Spectaculum sounded a lot like Paris Connection, once you see past the actively unhelpful pasted-on circus theme. That turned out to be pretty accurate, though the market is more volatile than PC and Spectaculum doesn't have the cleverness of shares and tracks being represented by the same cubes. There's a 'gamers variant' that gives a little more choice in track-building, but I prefer the basic rules. Like Kingdom Builder, I think the constraints are the point, and the basic rules keep the game as snappy as it needs to be for something so simple.

Calling this a 'buy-low, sell-high' game really doesn't do it justice...   This is a combination of a stock market game with a route building game.  And while you do buy and sell at strategic points to make money, it has a nice clean and streamlined feel that all of my friends and family that have tried it have REALLY liked.  It has surprised us all and I thank Richard Ham's overview for cuing me in to this games existence.  Sure the theme is a bit pasted on, as most people say for about any Knizia game, but this is not to be overlooked.  Quite good!

Jogo que aborda um tema que facilmente capta atenções, com componentes de muito boa qualidade, ilustrações de sonho e autor cujo nome vende por si, sendo que, no entanto, deveria ter sido mais pensado e melhor editado, pois percebe-se que facilmente poderia passar de joguinho a jogão, apenas com um pouco mais de trabalho e empenho. Joga-se, mas a experiência de o jogar podia e deveria ser muito mais aprazível!

Very fun, but sadly underrated stock market game with a very laboured travelling circus theme - the artwork on the cards seems wasted. But this is a short, sharp, enjoyable game and for me far better than Knizia's Buy Low, Sell High. I recommend using the variant suggested in the rules which involves drawing four tokens. Still available cheaply in the UK.

Looking at Reiner's latest releases, a hidden gem. A family-friendly stock trading game disguised with a weird medieval theme. Easy to teach, some interesting decisions and the playing time of 30 minutes feels just right. Stock prices are determined via chip placement on a randomly laid out game board, and as the clusters of different colors develop, players try to predict and influence the direction, where the colors will go (there are lots of plus or minus tiles on the board, called 'village-tiles') and to find the right moment to acquire or sell shares. Trading actions are restricted to two per player's turn, so there is little downtime. If your friends are prone to AP, I wouldn't recommend the variant where you play 3 out of 4 chips. Underrated because of the IMHO ill-fitting theme. If you like Buy Low Sell High, then you might like that one, too.

I like the concept of this essentially being a very simple stock market game. I thought it would appeal more to my wife when I'm not sure she'd ever play something like Acquire but we both felt it was only 'ok'. It works fine but isn't particularly thrilling.

RATING: 7.2
1 play, 3er, basic rules.

The game being from R&R (makers of great party games; but I'm not a huge fan of those) and by Reiner Knizia (making mostly lighter fare these days, and long past the time when he was an automatic buy, let alone an automatic look-at) I had little hope for it. But hey, it's actually quite good! Don't be led astray by the designer/publisher ... this is actually a nice little stock game sort of like Paris Connection / SCNF! But it seemed more fun than SCNF, maybe due to the random draws and the ability to screw with each others' stock values? I also like the random setup; each game will depend not only on the geography of the board -- which colors are likely to go up/down in value when you want them to? -- but also on the random order in which discs are drawn. If I'd realized it was really a train game, I would have tried it sooner. We had some fun with this, and it should play quickly -- might have to play it again as a quick filler!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
The board is covered in hexes, with several village spaces marked: randomly distribute the tiles on these spaces. There are also 4 tracks recording the value (0-25) of 4 colors (circuses); all start at 5. Decks of stocks (entertainers) are placed near the starting spaces of each color; players each get 1 stock in all 4 colors, and 20 ducats. 24 wooden discs in each color are placed in a bag; players draw 3 (or 4 in the strategic variant) and keep them secret.

On your turn, you must place three discs. Each disc must be played adjacent to either the starting space of that color or another disc of that color, max 1 disc/hex. If you cover a tile, or the central space (marked +5), resolve it immediately FOR ALL players. The tiles/spaces are:
- -1, -2, -3, +1, +2, +3, +5: adjust the value of the stock
- 2 coins: players earn 2 coins per stock of that color
- disease: players must pay 2 coins per stock of that color; if cannot, sell that stock off at half-price (rounding down) until you can pay your dues
In addition, you may buy/sell (hire/fire) 0-2 stocks (entertainers), before or after (but not in the middle of) placing the discs. Buying/selling occur at current market prices.

At the end of your turn, draw 3 new discs from the bag.

[u]End of Game[/u]
The game ends at the end of a turn if either:
- the bag is empty
OR
- the central (+5) space is covered AND 0-1 of the red markers (2 coins or disease) remain uncovered

There is a final payoff for all stocks. The player with the most cash wins!

Good quick lightweight stockmarket game, but while you can freely choose which colour shares to buy or sell, the colours you can affect this turn are determined by pulling discs from a bag.

Random board setup treads a fine line between offering variation in gameplay and over-fiddly setup.

A remarkably clever game, with very few rules, that plays in about 25 minutes and yet offers decisions on every turn. Also, it allows the chance to be a 'dick' and cause people to have to sell their shares at 50% of their current value if you cause them to have no money. :)

Apparently, a rule is needed for what happens is someone goes bankrupt, but I've not seen this happen. My suggestion would be; "play smarter".

Yes, the theme is redundant and ridiculous, but it's also accessible and many people who've played Spectaculum probably wouldn't have signed up for a game about route building and share holdings. This almost makes me want to investigate 18xx games again.

This is a stock speculation game that fairly elegantly provides the basis for speculation via a spatial map. The random allocation of value increases/decreases on the map make long term "trends" rather unlikely though. This makes the game feel tactical. Also contributing to this is that your options for which stocks' values to affect are determined mostly randomly (and are supposed to be hidden info from others!).

The ending is a bit anticlimactic as stocks start to lose potential places their value could go.

This is not a game with "big moves." It's reasonably pleasant and easy to play but it doesn't inspire wonder.

(Worth noting that I found Spectaculum underwhelming for exactly the reasons I thought I might. I should trust myself more or at least not buy things just because they are cheap.)

Notes on components: I love the small board, but the shares should have been cubes not cards. Cards are harder to read and take up more space. Also, the money is not easy to read (5s vs. 10s in particular) and there should be a bit more of it.

Good, simple, quick, stock market game where the stock prices are manipulated through growth of each company on a map - moving into randomly setup, risky/profitable areas with spaces which increase/decrease stock prices, pay out dividends and tax stock owners. This is quite clever and innovative and actually very mechanically thematical for company growth in a typical Knizia abstracted way - except of course that the game is not themed as a stock market game at all, but as a travelling circus game!?! Basically, similar to Buy Low, Sell High but completely different and significantly better.

Still very good, simple, quick, fun, stock market game. This is/should be the Settlers Of Catan / Carcassone / Ticket To Ride of stock market games.

Another great filler by my favorite designer; a stock game with a spatial element need I say more. NOTE: we played with the variants that (a) each player draws up to 4 disks, not 3 (still only plays 3, and may discard the leftover before drawing), (b) player disks are open information.

A "solid 7" Euro and a Knizia redemption compared so some of his more recent releases.  It hits the Euro marks for low luck, fast play, short rules, and tough decisions.  Will make for a good filler or starter game.  Abstract theme but I like the unique card art in this game.

Played twice, rated twice.  I'd better stop at two plays, because I can only see my rating going further down.

[i]Spectaculum[/i] is a player-driven stock game that grinds through the bare essentials (stocks, dividends, penalties, market changes), then throws out the bathwater with the rest of the baby. Knizia's better, faster stock game is [i]Quandary[/i] (aka [i]Loco![/i], [i]Botswana[/i], and/or [i]Flinke Pinke[/i]), which is more abstract, more frustrating, and more fun.

There's also a problem with the title itself. [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5272/hilarium]Hilarium[/url] is a successful name, for instance, because it calls to mind a tickle orgy of snorts, chuckles, and guffaws. To compare, [i]Spectaculum[/i] - as remarked by a female opponent - sounds like a sales conference focusing on gynecological instrumentation.  That's not a good mental association for half of your purchasing audience.

The theme looks very refreshing and interesting. Too bad, this is pasted on, and has nothing to do with this, very abstract, game. Nevertheless, you will enjoy this short game. It’s not very good, but it isn’t bad either. A lot of luck is involved, which will give you the feeling that you aren’t able to control any aspect of the game.

Buy low, sell high, while spreading each circus troupe's stomping grounds around a modularly set up board, in order to manipulate its value, and trigger some immediate effects, too.  I hadn't really been drawn to this game, despite (or perhaps because of) its festive presentation, and upon playing (and even winning), that feeling hasn't really changed; however, I should point out that I probably enjoyed it the least of the players.  Don't get me wrong:  It certainly wasn't bad.

I like this game as a trading game. Theme is absolutely irrelevant. And it has similarities with games like hab und gut, in that you buy and sell, and then influence the price by placing counters onto a grid. However, its not a deep game and it doesnt vary a great deal from game to game. But as a £10 game is OK.

This game had so much potential. The minis look great and come pre-painted. All the unit stats are right on the mini's base.  Unfortunately it's still mired to free-form movement paradigm rather than making use of a grid. Makes the game more theater than competition.

And worse the Wiz-kids design team is short-sighted. The click-base stat curve combined with the game rules make for a slow-moving, boring game of hide and seek. Sniping and turtling is encouraged. 

And what's the deal with all those stupid ICE mechs. No one wants to play with an ICE mech!

House rules (like attacks of opportunity ala D&D) really help it.

I got this game because I'm a big fan of Batteltech. I thought it might be similar to Battletech only less time consuming. This is the last collectible game I will ever play. The game has almost no strategy. Again, whoever spends the most money wins. This is one of the few games I regret buying.

Game has solid mechanics for a CMG.  Easy to learn and playable with only a small force.  Investment can be minimal or if you have as much fun with it as I have you can spend enough to make your wife cringe.  
Uses the simple Clix system to add dynamic units with individule attributes with out the need for extensive rulebooks.

RATING: 8
WAYYY more than five plays on this one, I loved the universe and the setting, and the mechs, now is the time to pick up on the more esoteric units on eBay for (kinda) cheap, but this one got fairly complex and not all of it good. I personally will not relinquish my ride, and have enough combined arms armies for a four player 5000+ point battle ( O.O ) However, it holds up well and is a relatively quick set up and into measuring and firing PPC's and lrm's at Tubers and Capellan snakes alike..oh wait, did I lapse out there for a second? Seriously well over 100 games of this played, A couple of tourneys and ONE move from qualifying for the first national tourney held way back when, soft spot here!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a decent game for Battletech fans and giant robot lovers alike.  Very fast playing with all the book keeping done for you on the click bases.  The collectability is something that you either love or hate, but if you hate it, you can just buy singles, which are reasonable except for the uniques.  That's okay because most uniques are not a better value for the points or unbalanced.  An army without uniques can be just as effective.
After a lot of play, I can say that some of the mechanics bug me.  I hate that mechs can't move and shoot.  I also don't like how expensive vehicles can be negated be puny infantry stands because they lack close range weaponry.

BoardGameGeek seems to be neglecting how MechWarrior had a revamped game called Age of Destruction after Dark Age, but the game components are compatible. Of all the games I've played, I believe MW:AOD is the most respectable strategy AND tactics game available.  It is also realistic, beautifully created, and highly customizable.

An interesting combined-arms miniatures game, downgraded half a point for collectibility. I played from close to release until around the release of Firepower, around 3 years, until I quit for non-game-related reasons. This is a miniatures game, played without a grid like most Clix games, and I think it works well as a light wargame. The biggest problem is expectations: most people expected Mechs to totally dominate the field, but this is really a game about balancing between various types of units. (Exception: the initial release suffered because infantry dominated the field. The first expansion, which I suspect was used in play-testing, introduced the artillery pieces that kept popcorn from automatically being the best unit choice.) Another problem is balance: some unbalanced units were published at various points, which really caused some rules to be skewed. (I know WK promised no banning pieces, but the SS Arrow IV [i]really[/i] deserved it.) Still a fun game, with a lot of options. And now it's not even collectible any more, having moved to a fixed release format.

Certainly had balance issues when artillery and helicopters were added, but it was a decent chess match (since one can premeasure movement).

Nice simplification of the old Battletech game.  The miniatures are beautiful!  Collectability aspect is a big turn-off, and the game feels just a little to simple for me.  Making your own mechs was a huge aspect to Battletech which is missing in this game.  Still, it&#039;s fun for what it is.

Poor rendition of BattleTech.  (Yes, I know it's not BattleTech, but MechWarrior.)  Why can't my long range missles go farther than a mech can charge?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I am playing a, from what I have been told, a heavily modified version of the game.  Which I must say if functional enough, though; I don't find if particularly interesting.  I don't care for the measuring from the center of the base as a convention.  I also don't really like the action based resource management aspect.  I don't think the Clix system lends itself very well to an off the grid/hex miniatures game where distance and facing matter since you have to pick the miniature up constantly to adjust the dial. 

 I have absolutely knowledge of the background of Mech Warrior and coming into the game borrowing units leave me a little confused at this point as their seem to be hundreds of units and at least a dozen unit types (i.e. mechs, tanks, helicopters, transports, artillery, etc.).  I understand that combined arms is important, but I think a game called Mech Warrior should give a good reason to have a giant robot in your army list.  Which I don't really think the game I am playing does. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game is ok, except for looking up rules for each and every color.  

I HATE  "collectable."  That means, it's broken because the thing you really want wasn't released.  

That's like only selling left shoes, but putting ONE right shoe in ONE random box.  One guy  has the game.   Everyone else wondered why they bought it.

This is the one Whiz Kids game I held onto after a large Whiz Kids purge... uh, actually I still have Crimson Skies, but still.  I've played this more than all the other Whiz Kids games and have had lots of fun doing so.  I like it best as a two player game.  Lots of interesting rules and mech and troop types.  Part of me wants to play the old school MechWarrior rules using these miniatures.  I wouldn't think it would be hard to do?

Wait, let me explain...as far as miniatures rules go, this game is fantastic.  Simple, not overly complicated, and the click bases are a great system.  The miniatures themselves are cool (except when you open the box and pieces fall out).  The problem- it's collectible and Wizkids caters to 12 year olds who can afford to blow all of their parents' money on "rares" and "exclusives". I don't care to participate in such marketing ploys so I therefore bought some figures and as soon as I started to see slews of "expansions" which should have been included in the base rules/sets anyway, "preorder this book and get the exclusive..." figures, and inflated ebay prices, I bailed.  Plus, it's a complete ripoff to old school battletech players because 90% of the mechs suck and are used to fill boxes with "common" figures.  Which do you prefer, an Atlas or a "mining mech"?  Probably will never play again.

An awesome way to implement the BattleTech game for speedy and fun play. Easy to get into, fun to play. Mechs, tanks, and troops pounding on each other is really what this game is about.

I always had a great time with this and even though I have not played in awhile I can't bring myself to sell off my collection.

RATING: 6
Good clix game (much more balanced and less obtuse than Heroclix). Overall a lot of fun - can be a tad intimidating to newcomers, but a really enjoyable strategy game. Lower rating due to collective nature (would be nice if there were more "complete" intro sets for players. As a result of the collector/tourny nature of the game, the rules are a constant work in progress which lessens the enjoyment b/c of rule breaks, nerfs, etc. 

I do not play in tourneys - only play with my gaming group and I provide almost all the mechs. As a result, have a different outlook on the whole collectors thing.

I was hoping to avoid these "Plastic Crack" games. But then I got some as a gift. Then I started spending hard-earned cash on them... so I refer to this phenomenon as "the gift that keeps on taking"... Sold off my figures for a small loss after a year.
 
As far as teh game goes, I was hoping for a faster streamlined version of battletech. Not so. It is an endlessly collectable, poorly-designed rules fest. It is supposed to be a game about the dominance of 'Mech in the 30th century, but then why is infantry so deadly and dominant?? Why are small groups of tanks often better combat units than a overpriced 'Mech?? Game was clearly too complex, too collectable, and not thoroughly playtested for fun and balance. Too bad. My first and last donation to the WizKids phenomenon.

RATING: 5
Sadly an outdated and dead game based on the game mechanics of Wizkids old Mageknight/Heroclix game mechanisms and set in the Battletech universe.  The models were interesting, though packaged in blind boosters.  It was kind of a cross between a tabletop miniatures game with a CCG type collection/trading aspect.  Pretty easy to pick up and learn the basics.  Sadly the game didn't do well and was canceled making it very difficult to find models to play these days.

Having full Sets of Dark Age, Fire for Effect, Death from Above, and a lot of different from nearly all following expansions... more than 1000 units.

In the beginning I was a "Battlemaster" for my Venue and made nearly every week some games or a competition. Due to that time the game rating was a clear 10,0... but WizKids is the only company I know so far, which is able to damage every game they created in a short time and fuck off their customers and supporters... Thank you for that suckers!

RATING: 6
Played 10+ times. It's all about the theme. Yep, a lot of dice-rolling, but also nicely tactical, with a great idea in the 'clix' system: reduced effectiveness as a unit takes damage or 'pushes' itself. It takes a few playings, and a few rules-readings to get all the rules down, but the new ruleset "Age of Destruction" will be officially released January 2005, which will make the game ever better. This is an expensive game, so I mostly trade for figures. Looking for Bannson's Raiders, and Swordsworn. I have mostly Spirit Cats, Liao, and Highlanders for trade, but also a smattering of everything else.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game is a collectable so it has two strikes against it in my book. Considering that I like the rules mechanics and I find the pieces themselves quite nice to look at. I am a fan of the clix system as a set of rules combined with a fig - very clever, but the weight of a collectible brings this one down.

I was heavily into this during the initial set.  I was already burnt out and disgusted with the game before the first expansion arrived.  It shouldn't have been called "Mechwarrior."  The game should have been called "Tanks and Hoverbikes."

Years later, I gave the game another chance with the rules changes from Age of Destruction.  The game really improved.  I started playing again with my Dark Age figures as well as purchasing some more from that initial set and Fire for Effect.  Now with rules tweaks and a cheap selection of singles, it's a fun game.

Well if you know or play battletech classic miniatures game, this one is easier to play because of the clix system. All the stats are on the mini, changing with damage.

It's pre-painted minis. At the begining, it was a collecting game, but now it runs in action packs format. I strongly suggest that you use Age of destruction rules.

Only played it once. Don't really like miniatures games in which you have to use a rulers to measure distance, but the game was reasonably fun, just not worthy to try again. Maybe in the future, I will try it again. On the plus side, I bought it very cheap so I wasn't that disappointed.

Didn't enjoy the move-or-shoot mechanic. Felt like if I moved my Mechs up, they just were blown to pieces or hurt enough to not be effective.

This is Wizkids best entry to date. The rules are pretty watertight and the game flows well. The only reason I don't rate it higher is because of the exceedingly silly rules regarding hand to hand combat for the mechs. I despise the whole notion of Mechs rushing towards each other and administering body slams. We play by modified house rules which make the game a little bit more acceptable. The mechs also move way too fast as they are the only units which can run, moving double thier move value(Big heavy mechs outpacing hoverbikes and scout buggys)?! Also, the ranges of the weapons are exceedingly short. We increaced the range of all weapons significantly.

RATING: 7
So there's alot of people who think that Battletech as a Collectible Clix game is akin to heresy of the most evil kind...I say to those people...get over it. MechWarrior: Dark Age (or Age of Destruction nowadays) is NOT a replacement for Battletech. Battletech is great when I want to waste a day with friends playing big reinforced battalion sized engagements and nitpicking whether to take a LBX10 or Ultra5 autocannon...of course thats not everyday; Dark Age is great for fast games at lunch when I need a game to play in less than an hour- the Clix system actually works rather well with the "combined arms" thing they are trying to promote in this game as it ensures Mechs are the most powerful units, but in standard sized games, its best to use a mix of a good mech, a high damage tank, and some fast infantry.
The game does have flaws, especially for those that are into the universe behind the game, the collectible-ness makes it hard to assemble good armies of one faction, and the new Pilot/Gear system allows certain units to be ridiculously maxed out in one certain trait.

But the clicky mechanic never really truly meshed with CBT. Maybe if they'd given a defense modifier based upon the target's movement, it would have been a finer experience. I like it anyway. Even better, I like not having to buy any more of it.

Many individual figures to trade.  I have mainly figures from the initial Dark Age expansion all the way up to Age of Destruction.  I have a lot of Limited Edition figures with boxes and dossiers.  If anyone is interested in trading for it, let me know.  I have wants on my list, but I'll look at other offers.

Take a fantasy game and replace orcs with mechs ... does this sound like a good idea to anyone?  This game is completely devoid of mecha flavor; one could easily replace the mechs with dwarves or something and it would make more sense.

Ugh, I got sucked in to this collectable game and couldn't get out.  What really frustrates me is that I have never played it because the instructions are so horsesh*t.  I love the miniatures but the rules are too confusing and could see arguments in the future about measuring how far something was or wasn't.  "No, you have to measure from there!"  "I did!"  "No, you measured from here!"  "Wow, that's like a milimeter difference.  Are you sure you didn't bump the table?"

A little dissapointing, I was hoping for a solid game along the lines of Battletech, but it didn't play anything like Battletech, and just got worse with each new expansion.  Also, did Wizkids think we'd be excited to open up a booster and find a farming mech?  Please.  Neat miniatures though!

Not a bad game overall, but I've enjoyed the Battletech games long before Dark Age entered the scene (I'm an Inner Spere Fed Suns warrior myself), and I actually prefer the older rules.  Don't get me wrong - the figures are well done, and the click-dial style of play is MUCH better than I once thought it would be - but I find the idea of having to spend a small fortune to build up a decent force quite annoying (I prefer to have the capabilities of my force set by the scenario I'm playing, not based around the miniatures I've been able to buy).

The minis are top notch and worth the investment if you're just a Battletech fan and don't even want to play.

We had to modify the movement rule (to 1/2 movement) to give ranged weapons a little more love. Otherwise, the melee mechs close and their damage is on par with guass rifles and AC20s....um, no!

RATING: 3
MW Dark Age is a great minature game.  I can't stand the collectible factor it has associated with it.  But, I look at it this way:  It costs less than pewter metal miniatures AND they're already painted.  I give it props just for that factor.  So, even with the cost of building your own metal army (Battletech or WH 40k), this game is still cheaper.  The clix system is revolutionary for miniature warfare.  The rules are OKAY, but like all the wizkids' clix games, they could be better.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I love the figures in this one, it scores incredibly well on the toy factor, but I hate the collectible aspect of it.  Also, the rules just need a little tweaking.  

Change in rating from a 5 to 8: as a dead game I was able to get a ton of figures relatively inexpensively, and finally sat down and redid the rules, a modification of the Call to Honor variant, so it plays faster and easier and is now the game it always should have been.

So the game is a 1, and the minis are a 7.

I rate CCGs and their expandable cousins (LCGs, etc.) on this basis: "I will likely never invest in one again, but assuming that someone else hands me a deck here's what I think of the game."

I loved classic BattleTech, but haven't played regularly for years. MW looked like fun, so I got into it with Dark Age...and then the entire line got canceled a couple of months later. Which is too bad, because it's a good game; I really liked the little bit I saw of it.

It doesn't scratch all of the classic BT itch, but it doesn't try to -- it's a different kind of game. With classic, unit design was my favorite aspect of the game; with MW, it's replaced by army building, with the spin coming from the limited actions per turn.

It's a 6 on gameplay, but a 5 because I don't play collectible games.

This is an absolutely gorgeous miniatures game. If you are into mechwarrior then this is a must have, though the collectabilty might be a serious turnoff. The rules leave much to be desired however, though the main problem is the clix feature. As soon as one unit recieves one good hit it is either destroyed or becomes totally useless. From the games I have played so far the winner was essentially determined within the first two rounds of play, even though the game went for maybe ten rounds. With a little tweaking this could be a truly awesome miniatures game.

Good game. Nice miniatures and a good value for the money. The rules are somewhat "Classic Battletech Lite", but not dramatically. It is faster playing than the regular Battletech, largely due to the simplified combat system, but not quite as detailed. There is plenty of chrome. My only complaint is the damage dials can be a pain in the neck for some of the figures.

I was surprised at how well this game works, especially for a clix game. It has all the feel of the original Mechwarrior game with much less bookkeeping. 

Plays deeper than one would expect with nice strategy and there are a good variety of pieces available to spice it up a bit. 

I don't own any of the figures and don't like the collectable aspect of it, but if you can pick up some of these figures cheap on Ebay then it's a good system that I think classic Mechwarrior fans will enjoy.

Rating only applies to the new version in Age of Destruction...much better.  Collectables suck of course.  Biggest problem for MW is that the factions aren't distinct enough, and they don't have any real scenarios or maps.  Now THAT would be cool if they did.  Base game is good though.

The game has degenerated into artillery pog flining, Donar drops, and generally isn't fun in a competitive setting (with people who know what the above are). Age of Destruction is updating MW:DA a la "Mage Knight 2.0" and from what's been shown so far of the new rules and unit types, it looks like the current problems may be fixed but we'll have to wait and see.

This is the first version of the mechwarrior clix game.  The rules were both complex and basic in bad ways.  Complex enough that there were 50 pages or so of fine print text in the play manual, but at the same time there were only like 5 basic actions you could take with a mech.  Fire for affect really fixed a lot of the basicness of the game, and made it much more interesting to play.

I used to like this game, but then the collection part of the game took over.  $10 for a small box of plastic pieces is too much considering you only get 3 pieces and they could all suck.  There is not even a rare in each box like most other collectibles either.  Too bad really as I enjoyed to mechanics of the game.

If you don't mind collectible games, this is a fun, non-simulation game of combined-arms combat featuring giant robots. The components are beautiful and the rules are clean -- unless you go to a tournament venue, where you might have to deal with a whiner or three (depending -- my old venues were great).

The updated "Age of Destruction" rules set added modifiable 'mechs -- you can now give a 'mech a specific pilot and customize it with additional gear. It places the emphasis on 'mechs over other units, which was the goal in the first place. This does tend to obselete 'mechs from the earlier sets, so I wouldn't go out of my way to buy earlier pieces were I just getting into the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This is a blind purchase collectible miniatures game, that is the bad part.
If you are like me, I don't play in tournaments or "collect" the game, then you play this for fun. I like to see small tanks and robots duke it out on the field. These come prepainted and have all the info you need to play the game built into a dial. This means no record keeping. But you do have to do a lot of measuring for movement and range determination. I like this game, I just don't have time and space to play it like I really want to.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not the equal of Classic Battletech for rules sophistication or customisability, but much much faster to play. This is the better of the Wizkids CMGs in my opinion, but like other Wizkids games, I felt it was let down by less-than-optimal rules and point price formulae. The inconsistent scaling of 'Mech sculpts was another minor bugbear.

I dropped out of the collecting scene at around about the Age of Destruction mark; I'm not sure how things have developed since then.

I actually really enjoy this one, but it doesn't seem right that this game should seem more complex than battletech, and it sorta does. If you ARE a battletech fan, the minis for MW are nice. Buy them and put them on new bases, and use 'real' hex terrain instead of the paper maps! It's cheaper than the metal minis for battletech. And if you're a carwars fan, the weapons on the mechs are great for modding hotwheels cars...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I like this because it lets you play huge force battles that would have been unreasonable with regular Battle Tech.  The downside is its awfully expensive to get that many models, and its annoying to play a game of high tech machines bristling with weapons where most of the fights wind up as melee combats.  Also annoying that all the neat mechs are unique and really hard to get.  Tried this for a little while but dropped it.

I've always been a fan of Battletech--even before I really knew what it was. All I knew when I was a kid was that there was this...universe out there where people fought in giant walking machines--and I wanted in on it. I used to frequent hobby shops (my hobby was buying model cars and watching my dad put them together for me, or at least half-together, before he got frustrated and threw the whole thing away), so that's how I became aware of Battletech. I remember I bought the core game when I was in high school...and found it way more complex and confusing than any game I'd ever seen. That was when I learned about wargames. I never really went back to play Battletech, because it required too much investment, both in money and time. But I still like the universe it exists in, and I like the *idea* of a wargame. I think Mechwarrior, with it's pre-made models and click-base mechanics, could be just the "wargame lite" kind of experience I'd like. Now if I could just find someone else to play it with...

Gameplay seemed a bit lacking.  With some house rules, it turned out to be more fun.  But, I only played it a couple times before realizing it's not my cup of tea.  Unfortunate, really, since I LOVE mechwarrior.  And I love combat games.  I had purchased 2-3 boxes of each of the first three sets, and now it's taking up way too much space.

Yet another Wizkids game that started out of the gate strong, fun, and (if not well balanced) at least playable, but quickly became bogged down in broken rules and horribly broken new playing pieces, which only got worse and worse as each new expansion came out.  Do the jokers at WK even know what playtesting is for?

I loved the setting of the game, but, after waiting a year and a half for WK to fix all the gameplay problems and still nothing, I finally gave up and joined the exodus of players out of the game.  Their institution of set retirement and a new edition that effectively made obsolete nearly my entire Mechwarrior collection to that point were just final slaps in the face.  I will NEVER purchase anything else for this game again.

I haven't played the ActionClix WizKidz version, but I must say, I love some of the minis and (don't hate me) but some are definitely better than IronWind Metals.  There is less detail in IronWind and most people can't paint worth a damn and the WizKidz ones are professionally painted.  Anyways, just a matter of opinion.

Great game in that you can make it simple with just a few units or have a massive war with many players. Overall is a good game for those that are not usually into wargames but able to spend the evenging hanging out with friends.

I have collected about 1600 pieces and most are in new condition but I do have many multiples which I would like to trade to fill in my collection.

Could be a fun, quick game with a small number of miniatures.  Though it's nice to have a big selection to choose from.

Mechwarrior is an evolution of the original Mage Knight skirmish system that has been adapted to FASA's classic Battletech universe. Unlike previous miniature games, Wizkids Games made it a point to create units that were more like action figures than static models. Many of the Mechs (the game's giant bi-pedal weapons of war) and vehicles have moving parts, meaningless to gameplay but certainly adding to the cool toy factor. The same color coded dial system used in Mage Knight is here, and it suffers the same problems. Dial colors fade on older units, while the glue that holds the dials in place (especially on the Mech's heat dial) seems to deteriorate to the point that the dial stickers simply fall off. Otherwise, the miniatures look good, if a bit out of scale, and make for a pretty cool looking battlefield... assuming you provide your own terrain.

 Although it evolved from Mage Knight, Mechwarrior is a stronger game than its predecessor. It provides more decision making and deeper strategy, while improvements to the system have done a great deal to add options and flexibility to gameplay. Of course, not all of the additions to the system work. The ability to customize the pilots and weapons for each Mech (starting with the Age of Destruction set) was a great idea, but the actual mechanic is poorly executed. This is mostly due to pilot and equipment cards that are poorly balanced against each other. For example, there is little incentive to play a pilot that provides bonuses of +1 move, +1 attack, and +1 defense, when a +1 move, +2 attack, +1 defense pilot is available. The same goes for the equipment, as generally there are combos that far outstrip everything else. To make matters worse, the rules allow you to use units from any faction in a single army. This leads to stagnation in unit choices, as well as many clone armies. You simply play with the best piece for any given function and relegate the rest to the shoebox. When it's all said and done, only 10 or 15 percent of a given release ever sees play. Not exactly a big bang for your buck...

So what's to like? Well, for me it's all about playing around with giant robots. It also helps that I have friends that drive them (see user Zxqueb's profile pic.)

If you can get around some of the games quirks, ie. Tanks with flexible mass (80 ton Mech busters riding inside 30 ton transports), Mechless armies (it's Battletech for Christ's sakes) and Clan Ghost Bear (who only have missiles when their armor falls off), there's a pretty good game here.

 While Mage Knight got my feet wet, Mechwarrior brought me completely back into gaming. I logged hours of tourney play, travelled to a few new cities (Philly, Indy, Columbus), and made some great friends. While the game is pretty much dead to me now, the friendships I forged playing it are still going strong. Thank you Mechwarrior, now let's go play some snobby Euros...

This is a good beer and pretzel game which makes for a fun way to spend an evening.  The good: Great miniatures and easy to understand rules which play quickly.  The bad: The rules are a still a work in progress in some ways, but each time Wizkids updates the game gets a little better and the strategy more complex.

[b]THE ATLAS:[/b]

1. Superb BattleTech theme.
2. Excellent pre-painted models.
3. On-the-base clix stat system.
4. Zero book-keeping gameplay.
5. Combined arms army building. Who doesn't love having a force consisting of hover tanks, VTOLS, battle armour suits, and 40' high Mechs?
6. Opportunities for varied tactical play.
7. Push-your-luck activation/heat/push rules, that can reward and punish gutsy play.
8. Small scale. This means you can play out large scale futuristic engagements within cities and forests, etc, without having to take up your entire living room or conservatory.
9. Quick, simple rules.
10. Better than BattleTech that birthed it.

[b]THE DEATH FROM ABOVE:[/b]

1. If you don't like giant robots smashing other giant robots to smithereens you'll hate this.
2. Plenty of dice rolling.
3. Interesting, but flawed, activation mechanism.
4. Collectable.
5. Out of print game, with manufacturer in trouble/dead.
6. You'll have to create your own scenarios.
7. Weapon ranges are a little short for megawatt fusion cannons wielded by 100-tonne walking Mecha. Well, you know what I mean.

[b]HOUSE RULES/SUGGESTIONS:[/b]

1. Ignore faction specific model loyalty, if you don't have enough models. Enjoy what you have.
2. Ignore faction abilities.
3. Ignore the hero pilot rules, and the special equipment add-ons.
4. Mechs cannot run.
5. Ignore the look-up rules for coloured squares/circles on the clix dials. Except for maybe the Atlas' hardened battle armour. Maybe.
6. Ignore the ranged, indirect fire combat rules.

6. Change the activation system to the following:

Each turn, activate ONE model at a time, players alternating, until all models have been moved. During your activation, each model may do one of the following: SHOOT, MOVE, CLOSE COMBAT, or VENT (Mechs only)- as the respective player decides. The notable exception to this are VTOLs, who may MOVE/SHOOT or SHOOT/MOVE during their activation.

Also, any model may also be "pushed" once after it has been activated, but before the other player moves his next model.

This destroys the decidedly frustrating system of only being able to move a handful of models per turn, leaving a bunch of other vehicles idling in the wings for turn after turn. Players would just use their Mechs instead of fully utilising a combined force. The only way to have real fun in this game is to be able to manoeuvre all your models on the battlefield, whilst avoiding the clunky IGO-UGO system of olden times.

I love the world of battletech. Dial click system makes this game different to other skirmish games I have played, and I like it very much. Also when I'm a bit lazy to paint my models, I like it when Mechs come already painted. Only thing that I don't like, even if it brings it's own flavour to the game, is that this is CMG.

A smooth system which is best in a tournament setting.  Even though there are dice, tactics play the most important role in this game, even at a high level.  Downside is that there are too many useless pieces in each set and no enforced faction purity at tournaments.

I generally do not go for collectable games but I do collect toys and I like mech so I made an exception for mechwarrior.    The game is actually a bit slow for my personal tastes but pretty well thought out.  My game group has experimented with adapting the rules from Shockforce 1st ed. to speed the game up, worked out well and I would recommend playing this way especially if you are playing with people that are not really into miniature gaming.

Nice race game, with an interesting "tower" mechanic; apparently a lot of people don't read the rules thus aren't aware that you don't have to play with the doors.
However, I think that it is a nice push your luck thing, that also acts as a catch up mechanic.

Je trekt door het land met je bende van helden.  Allemaal samen dus.
Maar het is evenwel niet coöperatief.
Ieder kiest 1 van de 4 mogelijkheden (kijk naar de torens) qua bestemming.
Onderweg neem je gems (gekleurd en/of zwart), die je kan ruilen op bepaalde plaatsen voor geld/punten.
Einddoel is om het hart van de prinses te veroveren, dus je moet onderweg ook draken verslaan en daardoor hartjes verdienen.

Misschien is dit spel wel iets leuks voor kinderen, maar voor volwassenen is het veel te licht.  En saai.
Wij geraakten precies niet weg van de linkerhamstring van het spelbord.

Dit is een voorbeeld van een spel dat er van op afstand goed kan uitzien (ik had er een WANT op gezet), maar die in de praktijk dik tegenvalt.  Zelfs voor mijn 8-jarige dochter, denk ik.

Played at Essen 2016. The rotating towers were neat and felt unique. Also, having only one group piece that was moved around the board by everyone felt interesting. Now, this did have the potential to make the game frustrating if the piece was constantly moved in a direction you did not want to go. However, there was something useful to be done in every corner of the board which was nice. 

After a while, we all met the end game conditions in the same turn and from there it was only the luck of the draw that determined the winner. This was a bit underwhelming and made the collecting part of the game feel a bit pointless.

Now, this was only one game and it was fun and quick but not too satisfying in the end.

Although I'm not a blind fan of the work of the Brands I can in most cases at least appreciate the workmanship with which they've put together their titles. They always manage to hit a specific spot in the phase space represented by rules complexity, game depth, ease of play, and more; and that can't be easy. Touria appears to be a rare exception where they are wildly off the mark. Once you begin playing it's obvious that it has been conceived with (*nose in the air*) less-demanding gamers in mind. But even so the game is as lifeless and colourless as its atwork. Randomness is rife, nothing interesting to captivate your attention, and all you do is collect stuff in one place and drop it off in another, thereby transforming it into something you can win the game with. Possibly, because the end game is basically a die roll with a penalty if you roll wrong. Wut?! 

In this segment Elfenland sets the standard, and Touria falls way below it. Elfenland is cleaner, with more and more obvious player interaction, and more appealing artwork to boot. Yes, Touria's towers are nice, but they obscure information you need in order to block other players, so most of the time you won't bother. I can only speculate as to the cause of the Brands' minds to lock up, and sincerely hope that their next offering will be up to their usual standards, because Touria seems to be heading straight for the discount pile in the Heidelberger sales stand.

Lovely game by the designers of Village. 2-4 players, 60 minutes. The mechanic regarding the towers, where you have to choose an action which is visible from your side of the table works really well and adds a tactical layer: if I choose this action, then the tower turns and will offer my opponent (especially in a 2-player game) this specific action, so that's something to take into account. Especially as this is a race to get to 5 (or 7) gold and hearts to be able to enter the castle to go look for the prince(ss) before anyone else does. Gorgeous artwork, a lot of fun. My son fell in love with this game instantly so for that reason I'm rating this quite high. Looking forward to playing this again and also with more people.

RATING: 4.5
The tower mechanic that I was interested in certainly didn't disappoint, you must really consider which action you will take as this rotates a tower, providing you with a more desirable option of next turn? or is the action you have just given the next player too tempting for them to pass up? More tactical, react to what you have than strategic and no long term planning at all here
I like the tower mechanic however for me the rest of the game was a little lacking :(

Having one group piece to move around was an interesting concept with the possibility of sort of messing with opponents by moving the piece towards on edge of the board, however in practice since you get three 'free' movement points an your turn you can pretty much get to any space from anywhere else, so it all just feels a bit pointless.

The end game is a cute concept that allows multiple people a stab at guessing correctly however it is very disheartening if you arrive first and have opened multiple doors if somebody else ends up 'stealing' your victory

RATING: 7
A cool themed euro with some interesting mechanisms. I like that the game limits the actions you can take each round and I like the black gems which force you to be creative with your routes. It's a tactical game with interesting choices each turn.

However, the odd endgame keep it from being great. It's not bad, just a bit strange.

RATING: 4
This is a family game wrapped in cute artwork and a nice Medieval Fantasy setting, where the players' ultimate goal is to marry the princess - or the prince, as political correctness demands, no matter how silly it is that he is also wooed with jewelry. 
The gameplay is disappointing, considering the design team. The rotating towers for selecting actions are a fairly novel idea, but choices are often very limited. Some actions may be useless or, for lack of money to travel far, unusable. The game end, where you open doors trying to find the siblings (reminiscent of "Message to the Czar"), is so random that the rulebook comes with a variant to simply ignore it.

The towers are a really neat mechanic. It's not just a gimmick and they offer choices (but also restrictions) as to what actions can be taken.

That's the nicest thing I can say about this game... the actual end game is awful... get to the middle and then it's pot luck what happens.

RATING: 6.9
Intriguing concept for actions: There are four block-shaped towers; the action(s) available to you is whatever is facing you. After taking the action, you rotate the tower.  This changes what action  is available to everyone. If you really want an action that isn't available, you can spend a sword to turn the tower once.
It is a race to get the necessary resources and then find the princess. Finding the princess is a luck thing--on your turn you flip a tile and see if she is under it. If she is not you may have to now have additional resources to woo the princess when you DO find her, and of course, gives everyone else one more turn.

Interesting ideas, but the weird luck hunt at the end and how it can be possible for people to be "stuck" spamming the same actions over and over [on purpose] is what keeps this from being a game I would seek out playing (but intriguing enough that I wouldn't mind playing again).

Wow!  What a retro game...  Old-school (ugly) graphics and old-fashioned mechanics.  

And a pure luck can decide about the winner - towards the end you blindly draw from 9 tokens and you can accidentaly hit the winning one...  This feature pushes the rating down from 5 to 4.

I don't mind simple, family games, but this one is a bust.

I don't understand the bad rating from some players. say that this game is totally random and luckdriving, turning in circles and endgame is not more then rolling a dice is a real shame to say because it's possible to be prepared for this "randomness". if you have some extra money, use your elexirs in a good way or have some swords you can do a lot more than you think at first. Also for the endgame you can be prepared to go only there when you have some extra stuff. In fact, for me it's a very refreshing game, a few new systems ( walking in a group without being cooperative, turning towers ) and fine artwork. I can say that i'm a real gamer and i enjoyed it a lot, offcourse it is not chess where there is no luck involved but it a real cool game, for gamers and non-gamers.

Family game from R&R with a fine design pedigree, I think this is aimed at the younger set. The tower mechanism is cute but limiting, while the shared board marker is neat. Both contribute to the inability to plan ahead. The endgame can devolve into randomness if you don't come prepared. Cute, but one play is enough.

Cute family game with an original twist on action selection.
Also, the theme is lovely (competing in tasks to fight for princess's hand). Too bad the only piece in the game is a cardboard, not an actual knight piece... but that's something easily fixed.

I ordered one for myself blindly, purely on the names of the designers. When it arrived, rating wasn't great (6.4 on 19/10/2016), so I didn't have high expectations about this one. But my one play was in fact very fun. The mechanism of the towers is very new and refreshing and with the swords you have enough possibilities to manipulate them, if necessary. 
It's off course all very light (as well in theme as mechanic (run around to gather the necessary resources in the form of hearts and gold for wich you need jewels and/or swords first)), but even as a fan of the more strategic games I can enjoy this game and would never turn down a game of Touria when asked.

The towers are a nice gimmick, but most of the time, I find that there is only one decent move available to me (depending on the position of the towers, the position of the adventurers, and my available resources). Until you get near the end, little planning seems possible or useful, making the game a bit too light for me.

A fun race game.  Enjoyed it with 2 players.  I like the ending the best, searching the doors in the castle for the princess (or prince.) This is where the climax and most of the excitement is, especially when your opponent is right behind you!  I can't imagine using the other variant in the rules (first one to make it to the castle with 7 hearts and 7 coins wins.)  

Replaced the cardboard standee with a large wooden pawn (I hate standees.)

If this game even looks remotely good to you, buy it.  You'll like it.

RATING: 5
Simple gameplay that is entertaining nonetheless, and there are a couple of unique mechanisms that make this a fun game.  The idea of having a rotating action selection "menu" for each player, as well as having all players sharing the same pawn on the map means that decisions about what to do on one's turn are not just about what the player wants to accomplish, but what opportunities they want to provide or deny to the other players.  The end game sequence of opening doors while searching for the prince and princess makes for an interesting catch-up mechanism, as the player who comes to the castle with both the prerequisites and additional resources may be better off than the one who rushes in as soon as they have seven hearts and seven coins.
In the end, there are fewer interesting decisions each turn than I thought, and far less strategy than I imagined when I bought this game.  It's light, easy enough to learn, and very fun for the first few plays, but I don't see it having enough variety to be worth hanging on to.  However, it would be idea for anyone wanting to get their grade-school children interested in more euro-style gaming.

It's fun, but not best with 2 which is how I mostly play. Even with more players, its an intriguing game, but not hugely compelling. For such a simple game, there are a few fiddly rules that, whilst not complicated for adults, are to complex for younger children who really should be the target audience.

A race for betrothal of the royal princess being the first to bring her gold, deeds of love while not bringing any cursed gems to the castle. The signature feature of the game is its 3D dancing towers that uniquely determine available actions by the walls facing each player. This adds an interactive and challenging wrinkle to player planning by changing available options every time the towers rotate.  Unusual element of sharing a pawn to move point to point around the kingdom. I like the juxtaposition of having to spend gold even though it is a needed resources to reach the castle in order to gain other benefits towards earning the also needed hearts.

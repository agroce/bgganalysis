make certain to play the end game properly; everyone secretly selects and discard 2 cards, then everyone reveals and plays the remaining 2 onto their 'field'. You can sometimes steal majority!

130929 Its fallen back.  Its a touch dry or mathy or something.  Coloretto has taken its place in the bag.

121231 Obviously its risen.  It really is a nice tight mean game and it plays well 2-6.  One of my top fillers, especially for gamers who want to play a card game.

111022 Alice in wonderland...not a great game, but given the cards I'll most likly have to pick it up at some time.  We'll see if it rises now that I have a real deck.

A simple abstract card game with "Alice in Wonderland" images painted on the cards. I hesitate to call this a theme but it looks nice enough. There are a few decisions to make here but it feels like luck plays the biggest factor. It's only a short filler and it works well.

LIKE: Great artwork on the cards. Interesting game play, I really like the majority scoring and keeping a card at the end.
DISLIKE: Random. Some downtime as players examine every situation.

OVERALL: Swingy game and a bit too long for that much randomness. If you don't start with any 10's, it makes a difference compared to those who do.

I got this game purely based on the delightful illustrations. The production quality is very good indeed (the coasters are an odd addition, but very nice in themselves). I boffed the rules on this several times in my first plays - the way cards are removed, the inverted scoring at the end - these are complicated bits to an otherwise should be simple game. I like it, but don't love it in the end - because it's a bit to upside down in thinking and this takes away from the potential charm. It also feels highly swayed by the draw of cards. So ok, but not great.

If you ignore the fact that the theme is that you are competing parade organizers in wonderland, this is a fine game. The object is to score the least points by the end of the game by playing cards into the... Parade, that do not result in you collecting any new cards into your tableu. It leads to some interesting choices as sometimes you cannot avoid taking cards so instead you have to try and obtain majority in a color or colors to reduce the penalty you would take at the end of the game. Which means you may end up competing with other players on several fronts. I recommend the new edition in the purple box as the older edition looks like it used clip art.

[2-6] This game has a simplistic overtone but a very deep field of strategies lie just beneath the surface.  Easy to explain and very incredible to see the ah-ha moment go off in people's eyes when they 'get it.' It's great to feel how different the strategies are for a 2p game as opposed to a 6p.  Great card game!

I was very happily surprised by this gem.  Played it on a whim, because Alice in Wonderland, and came back to it twice more after a break.  Awesome depth for a simple filler game.

There are similarities to Guillotine, but without the sheer randomness of action cards.  I'd say it is one or two levels deeper than Guillotine, but even simpler to explain.

Gameplay is very straightforward, but strategy and tactics change based on your hand and the other players' personalities (do they challenge you for stuff, or do they do their own thing?).

This is also really awesome as a 2-player game, with or without the "small" change in majority scoring.  I like how the game has an innate catch-up mechanic, where the player with less points can't end the game as easily as the player with more points.

1st play: Very pretty art, likable theme. I'm not sure how much game there is here, there are a few options, and mostly calculable decisions. It's probably one of those games I can take or leave, but for someone who likes the movie, I bet this game shines.

2nd play: Yep. I liked it better than last time but still feel like your score is pretty related to luck of the draw. Not bad but I won't pick it.

An excellent relaxed card game that is both simple and elegant in its execution.  Not precisely sure why, but is just fun to make very basic decisions in this game, the mark of a good card game.  

The ability to take negative cards and ameliorate their adverse effect by ending the game with the most of that suit, curiously, makes this game truly shine.  Parade thus manages to provide a very mellow "shoot the moon" experience throughout the whole game for all players.  Bottom line:  a simple, basic and brilliant card game.

Parade is a 20 minute card game best played with two. On your turn you add a card to the end of the row and take any cards that meet certain conditions. Cards taken count at face value as negative points, with the exception that if you have at least two more cards of any suit than your opponent, each card counts as only one negative point. This last rule is essential, as it provides an incentive to actually take cards from the row.

I've only played it with two, but it seems best at that number: more players means both less control and less incentive to attack the long suits of the other players. As a two-player affair it becomes a lot more of a tactical knife fight, especially since all of the cards played stay face up, so card counting is not only encouraged but expected. The hand size is only five cards, however, so the game doesn't become too slow as there aren't very many options presented to the players each turn. The luck inherent in the card draw is also a significant factor, but it's not clear that it dominates the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played with four players and it seemed pretty random and chaotic.  You can't really plan ahead, and luckily drawing the right cards at the right time is a big deal.  So you basically try to find a good move with only some strategy on whether you should try to get the max in a color.

Two players seems more promising as you can plan out your moves more and it's worthwile to try to sabotage your single opponent.  I'm not sure though, I need to try it out more.

Parade is a little card filler, filled with tension and though decisions, with just a little luck added to the mix, that plays surprisingly good with two, and reasonably well up to four players (with more the luck of the draw is much more decisive).

The tension comes from the need to aim for the end game trigger (have at least a card in each color), while also taking the minimum possible number of cards, BUT also take the maximum possible in the colors you want to have the majority.

With 2 players, the only rule change is that you need two more cards than your opponent to have the majority.

Overall, I really enjoy the game and would gladly explore it in more depth...

Special card game : the rules are simple and genuine. Easy to learn and fast play, but hard decisions to take. Maybe with playing this game some more, my score could raise.

I must admit, only after Schmidt brought the game out with the typical German Gründlichkeit, the game could have my attention. I was a bit confused by the Alice in Wonderland theme : now I know I was wrong.

Great game to play with my 13-year-old. My first experience with it was in 2-player mode. I have no idea how it plays with more than that. But we both really enjoyed the game. I took a riskier approach by collecting a ton of cards at the first in a few of the colors. My strategy was to have the most of several colors and end it when my opponent was in a bad position. It worked, but I didn't win by as much as I thought I would. Easy game play and an excellent theme. I am certain this one will come out again when my daughter and I need something that sets up quickly and lasts long enough that we can both relax and develop a strategy.

A very simple card game that I will only ever play with 2. Add a card to a line (the parade) and then take cards equal to or less than the number you played or the same color. But, you don't take cards counting back from your card equal to what you played. Cards are worth -1 to -6 in 6 colors. If you have the most of a color though (or 2 more than your opponent in a 2 player game) that color only scores -1 for each card. That's it. Very thinky. I believe there would be kingmaker issues if this was played with more than 2.

It seems that in this age of information it is very hard for me to be genuinely surprised by a game mechanism.  Almost everything I have either experienced, or at least heard about before I ever play the game.  However the card placement mechanism in this game is absolutely unique.  Knowing when to place which card is challenging and forces you to think in a completely new way.  Add onto that the scoring mechanism (which isn't unique to this game, but is interesting) and every card you play forces you to do some unusual mental gymnastics to decide whether you can afford to play it.

However, this is also the downfall of the game.  Since you have to really think out each move, players can really lock up in analysis-paralysis.   Add into that the fact that the line-up looks completely different from one turn to the next, and all the sudden every single player takes several seconds to think out their turn.  Even the fastest thinkers I know have been locked up into a moment of analysis-paralysis because of this game.  Now, a few moments per card isn't a big deal, but it seems unwelcome in a short little card game that should be over in 20 minutes.  Don't get me wrong, I kind of like the game, and its uniqueness.  But, be warned, it is not for the slow gamers in your group.

Pros: 

Quality & beautiful game production. Fun if the cons don't bother you too much:

Cons:

Player seating position can benefit some more than others. 

Six players is way too many: 
1) You can't really plan your move until your turn. 
2) Players think out their plays for each card in their hand = Lots of down time.

This is not a "fun energy" game, but it is a fun group puzzle. 

Low energy, slow, people get quiet as they constantly calculate possibilities and end game scoring strategies in their heads. 

But in the end, luck factors in pretty high.

Didn't care for this at all - even as a filler. It's mostly tactical - decide the best (or least worse) card in your hand to play, then draw a replacement. Problem is half the gametime is counting the cards on the line ... having a mat with the numbers on it would speed things up.

Theme is paper thin, didn't enjoy playing at all. Many other filler card games I'd pick over this.

[b]Intelligent set collection:[/b] Parade epitomizes the kind of limited play I want in a short game. The fixity of the hand and play is soothing - you play one and draw one, so there's no worry about cycling through your cards quickly. 

I was intrigued by the fact that even though I like Parade and Coloretto, I'm not that interested in playing Jaipur. I think the major difference is that in the first two games, the sets are not "fixed" till the end of the game (as opposed to Jaipur, when you're constantly debating whether it's time to trade in); and during the game they're open, so that you can shift your strategy relative to your opponent's moves. Also, even though I like a bit of chance in my games, the combination of cards *and* mixed tokens is too much for me - I like the relatively quick (though not entirely certain) calculations you can do with the unique cards in the Parade deck.

Wow, this is fantastic. Better than Arboretum which I enjoy but both do something excellent with just a deck of cards.

RATING: 7
Quick filler which can be played with basically anybody. You try not to collect cards from the table and this can be figured out rather easily even though you might not be able avoid the cards each round. But the interesting thing is that in the end you add up two cards to your sets randomly from your hand and this can make a huge swing in your points.

There's absolutely no reason to buy the game since it can be played with Sticheln deck.

Interesting light card game. The only issue, and unfortunately it is a big one, is the huge downtime and AP between turns while players try to work out the what to do. Difficult to plan ahead due to the constantly changing card layout so when it is your turn you suddenly have to evaluate everything virtually from scratch.

A fun little card game.  This card game is a fun little game of minimising damage.  There are some neat choices - you want  avoid taking cards where you can, but do you take cards to try and get a majority? To spoil another players majority? Do you try and end the game early and hopefully in your favour?  For a short little card game it's quite fun.

Very decent wee game.  A little different from the norm and all the better for it.  The prospect of a painful points precipitation peaks as it proceeds - you can only pray that the conclusion invokes schadenfreude rather than despair!  The finishing touch is that the game length is almost perfectly judged to ensure the conclusion is satisfying without it outstaying its welcome. Uprated again after lots more games.

Yet another good entry into the Category 6/Stimmt Nicht genre of card games!

Basically, players are playing cards, hoping to avoid taking any cards.  Taking a card will score you points at the end of the game.  Points are bad.

The one twist is that taking more cards in a color than any other player will reduce each of those cards values to "1" rather than the number printed on the card, so often you will pick a color of card that you don't mind taking.  Inevitably, you will end up having to take some cards at some point in the game, so you'll try to only collect a certain color if possible.

When the deck runs out, whoever has the least points wins!

Updated 5/26/10.

Parade is in my Top 10 on the strength of the two-player game. In fact, the two-player game is so good, and so overlooked, that it recently motivated my second-ever review (find it [thread=525747]HERE[/thread]). 

Parade is a simple card game in the same vein as something like Battle Line. Like Battle Line, this game generates a ton of tension. Unlike Battle Line, the game has an incredibly subtle scoring system (and is therefore not so amenable to calculation). Because the scoring is in tension with the end game trigger, doing well in Parade usually means giving up the ability to control when and how the game comes to an end. This is not a game where success simply snowballs into more success. The game is about awareness, timing, and playing by feel.

With the high level of interaction, and the challenging tactical decisions, the game plays both mean and smart. (But with the hand-drawn Alice artwork, it's hard for the game to ever feel mean.) It's one of the few games that I think gets noticeably better with two. It will take a few plays for the depth, control, and nuances to become apparent. But even at it's most basic, it's a great tactical game that I would recommend to almost anyone.

Really fun game.  It's all about Min/Max on your turn, but it's really quick to figure that out.  You then try and figure if you can afford to take a card or 2 in a specific colour.  I love the artwork, and once you get past a couple of jenky things with the rules you can see how solid it is.  Scoring can be tricky the first time, and then it clicks what needs to happen.  Each card in a colour is worth 1 point while you decide which cards you need to keep.  Once they are kept, they are worth their face value for end game scoring.  Played 8 times in the first 3 days of owning, all at work.

Good calculatory fun! What can I say, I'm a sucker for hand management games. Considering things like "okay I'm DEFINITELY going to eat the same cards with two different plays... so which card is more valuable to keep/better to add to the line?" is like, mega fun for me.

Better with fewer players as the board doesn't change as drastically by the time your turn comes up again, allowing you to plan more effectively. But you know, it's a light 'n breezy kind of game anyway, I don't really mind playing it with more.

The theme is non-existent, but the cute Alice art is certainly pleasant.

Awesome filler. A kind of game where the layers reveal themselves quickly and continue to make the game more interesting.  I'm sure this will hit the table many times.

--Update: Not sure how to rate this game.  Our first two plays we played by the wrong rules and the game was awesome. Then, playing by the correct rules, the game was 'Meh' so we went back to the wrong rules.  I highly suggest playing by the variant where you score positive points for your non-majority cards and all majority flipped cards are -1.  The game has layers that way and hands don't play themselves.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Ok game, but not one that I would play unless everyone else wants to.  Winning a specific colour is interesting, but it is a false incentive to getting more cards.  Getting no cards is still the best.  
There really isn't much long term tactics or planning to the game other than what you immediately play.  This problem is worse with more people.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Love the unique theme on this one and the art is great. You simply draw a card and then take cards based on the number or color played. Of course because it's Wonderland you don't want points so getting cards is bad. The catch is if you have the most of 1 of the 6 colors you simply count the number of cards instead of the point value on the cards at the end of the game. Sometimes it makes sense to take a bunch of cards if they will give you the majority in that color and reduce your score. Good stuff!

1-21-12 update: This is turning into a very enjoyable, thought provoking, very versatile two player game. I haven't played with more, nor do I have the interest. The two card spread needed to mitigate the hit for taking cards seems to make the game. Also, it seems that with more, the hand management would become a bit too chaotic. But this is all theorizing. I guess i should try it despite the concerns. The two player game is very quirky and interesting.

(2011)After one two-player game, I'd say this is a quirky little thing that I'm more than interested in bringing out again. I think it will have a ton of 'couple' value once I introduce it to my wife.

Parade is a fantastic two-player game. I believe that is where the game truly shines. Working to manipulate the line of cards leads to some really tough choices that can have some really satisfying results. Having to have two more cards than your opponent to claim the majority of a suit creates some really feirce battles. I am surprised this game isn't more popular.

Players take turns placing cards in a central row. Cards are 'safe' up to the position equal to the face-value of the played card, after that, players have to take cards which are either lower value or the same color as the card they placed. Cards take are worth negative points. There's just two rules, but the amount of "shit, I did not intend for that to happen" moves is surprisingly high. Quick plays, about equal amount of luck and skill involved. The Z-Man edition is very beautiful, while the German Schmidt Spiele version has functional but rather bland artwork.

For such a simple concept, this game proves to be far from easy.  You place a card on the end of the existing parade line, and then count back the number of spots equal to your card's value.  Then looking at the cards to the left of that spot, you must claim any matching your card's color or those equal or lower in value.  Lowest score at the end wins.

To mitigate the pain, there is a Poison-like element, where the player having the most of a color is able to count each card as a 1 and ignore the face value.  On top of that, the game ends when someone claims cards in all 6 colors, so you can't diversify much.

Nasty little game where you have to overcome bad luck with your card draws.  As you might guess, the theme is pasted on.

Another good game from Z-Man's line of filler card games. This scoring system is similar to David and Goliath, a Spiel des Jahres winning trick taking game. There are two major decision points in the game. One is knowing when to play cards to avoid taking any cards out from the parade, or when it might be in your best interest to take cards. Two is knowing what cards to play to only take the cards you need. Both are very tricky to balance. Great game, highly recommended filler.

Another light hand management/minimise damage game. Depending on the state of the parade, you may collect (negative) cards with each card played. This leads to careful card selection to avoid pain and perhaps set up the parade to inflict it on others.

RATING: 7
Odd game of playing cards to and collecting cards from a central array. Every collected card counts its face value against you unless you have collected more cards in a suit than any other player, in which case each card in that suit costs you only one point. The strategy is delightfully difficult to grasp: which suits and how many suits to keep in your hand, whether to retain low cards or high ones, etc. Multi-player games are much different from two-player ones; both are enjoyable.

Minor houserule: With 2p, take out cards numbered 8-10, with 3p take out 9-10. This keeps the arc and duration tight across all counts.

As mentioned above the artwork is nice, but the connection between gameplay and theme is thin to non-existent. Still a great little card game.

UPDATE - the new (purple box) edition is a bit of a rip-off, being essentially twice the price of the original for just a deck of cards. The new artwork is nice but the rest of the package is distinctly meh. Very poor from Zman.

RATING: 7
A fairly simple card game where the aim is to take as little points as possible. Instead of being a classic trick-taking game however, it uses a clever mechanic: the conga line, or the parade. The deck is made up of 66 cards, broken down into 6 suits/colors of 11 cards, going from 0 to 11. The look and feel of the cards is simply gorgeous, with lovely Alice in Wonderland illustrations and a nice card stock. To start the game the dealer shuffles all the cards and deals out 5 to each player, and then creates the parade by laying down face up 6 cards in a line. On his turn, the player will lay down one card at the end of the parade, see if he needs to pick up any card(s) and then draw one more card. The game ends when the last card is drawn, then everyone gets one more go or if one player has taken cards in every suit. You then score your cards, with the lowest total winning. The player will pick up cards from the parade in the following way: first thing, using the rank of the card, the player will determine how many cards are safe, for example, if the parade is 7 cards long and you play a 5, then the last 5 cards would be "safe" and you wouldn't pick them up. Should the number be even higher (7 or more), then you wouldn't pick up any cards at all. Looking at the rest of the cards, the player would pick up any cards that are of the same color/suit and any cards that are of the same or lower rank. Fairly simple. At the end of the game, all the players dump two cards from their hand, add the remaining cards to those they picked up. You then determine who has the majority in each colors. These cards will be turned face down, with each of these cards counting for 1 point. All the other cards count for their rank value. Add up all the numbers and that's your final score.

Fun little game with nice decision making and some (slight) brain burning moments. Plays fairly fast, even with people with analysis paralyses. Will play again, especially with larger groups. I have the feeling that the game is more chaotic with 5 players and probably more tactical with 2 or 3.

I've tried this both with 2 and with 4 and it is pretty fun but nothing special.  I like the art but I'm not crazy about the graphic design, the font is quite ugly.  It reminds me a lot of lost cities, battleline, no thanks, and other card games that involve set collection and avoiding negative points, but the actual card collection mechanic is quite unique.  The gameplay is largely tactical, no long term strategy, and there is a significant luck factor.  Sometimes there are just no good moves you can make.  It's easy to teach to new players though and will create some laughs and fun moments.

Played three times.  There are almost, ALMOST no decisions to make and a "strategy" is really just hoping the one card you play and one you draw work in your favor.  Let me repeat: play the one card that impacts you the least (which will be obvious) and hope to draw another card that won't affect you too much.   That's it.  Next turn.  Any "strategy" tied to the unique scoring is usually forced on you. Maybe things work out, maybe they don't.

RATING: 6
The game seems simple and repetitive on paper, but when you play it the decision of which card to add is a little trickier than it seems.  That's where this game works - the choices give something slightly chewy to ponder.  Otherwise this could be a dull filler.  The fact that you don't want cards (unless you can get the most of a color) provides some tension, and the fact that two cards get added at the end puts another twist on it.   One concern, however, is that it always seems like one player is always able to avoid taking cards for the whole game.   I thought it was an anomaly at first, but it seems to happen in every game (with 5 and 6 players).   Recommend playing with 3-4 players for a better experience.

Been eyeing this small game many times. Forumeres have been saying how nice this card game is. I hesitated when I saw the designer and artist are Japanese, but when I saw the artworks are not even near the anime style, I got back on horse. 

Read the rule, but it was just okay. Now need to get it on the table to see how it goes. Hopefully brilliant. 

Condition: Cards are sleeved.
Reason for trading: Game just isn't for me after first try

this game looks as if it has not much to offer --- but surprisingly it is quite good, and offers a lot -- there is a method to the madness of stretching the parade or a method to claiming some high cards -- great little card game with a number of people -- easy to learn -- and surprisingly strategic -- timing is all important, drop those high cards early or hang onto them -- amazingly the brain get a wee workout on this innocent looking game

RATING: 7.25
Parade is a sneaky little game.  Logic would say that to achieve the winning condition of lowest score it would be best to take the lowest card, but this can be offset by trying to get a majority in the colours to reduce point penalties.

Best with 4.

A very quick card collection game with very complicated goals. Ever changing variables guide players through decisions of when to avoid or acquire particular suits of cards. The two player game has a very strategic edge and is very open to screwing the other player. Not complicated after an initial game, but very strategic for long term play.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Since this game is played with suits of numbered cards, I thought this would be a trick taking game but it's not.  The gist of it is that you have a line of cards and every round you add a card to the line and then you may or may not have to add cards to your tableau depending on what card you played and what's in the line.  Any cards that you get are negative points, however if you have the most cards of a particular suit at the end of the game, each of those cards will only be worth 1 point instead of their face value.  

The game end is somewhat in control of the players and one of the best best things is that at the end of the game you will still have your hands of cards and you will discard some of them and add others to your tableau of cards.  The English rules that I've read doesn't really state how to go about doing this, so we all discard face-down simultaneously and then when all are ready we reveal what we add to the tableau.  This creates a tension of 'do I take these because I might get the most in a suit or these because they're worth less points'.  

This a great filler.

I love the scoring mechanic of this game as it creates a fun balance between staying small or going huge, but the rest of the game doesn't warrant the effort. The mechanic associated with removing cards from the Parade is convoluted and bogs the game down. I'd rather play David & Goliath which implements a very similar scoring mechanism, unless I'm dealing with a very small group, in which case I would play something else entirely.

Continues in a line of Japanese card games that challenge what my beliefs of what a numbered deck of cards can do. 66 cards with just numbers and colors. That's it. Somehow these cards change their game value during the game. At times, tens are valuable, worth having, worth acquiring. Other times, 10s are the bane of your hand, they'll lose you the game. The fact that someone can come out with a game that, on its surface, looks to be a run-of-the-mill colors and numbers affair really impresses me.  I am also intrigued buy how half of your hand is scored.

Entertaining card game with 6 suits and 11 values (0-10). The goal is a low score when the deck runs out. These cards are in a line and each play seeks to lengthen the line or take cards strategically. Poor play nets you lots of cards...

Another stunningly simple but difficult game. The scoring is very similar to David & Goliath, but the gameplay is intriguing.

Fun but just more luck and damage limitation.

I liked it but didn't feel like playing it again. A bit to much randomness for my liking but of course that is to be expected of this kind of game.
I think I like Sticheln more because of the higher sense of mindfuck. (Arboretum goes to far).

Chulísimo juego de cartas con sabor a clásico de naipes pero con un aspecto inmejorable. La primera partida la jugamos mal y acabó en el cajón unos cuantos meses. En la segunda vez que salió a mesa, jugado a tres, descubrimos su potencial y nos picamos muchísimo. Tiene bastante más interacción de la que parece y muchas sutilezas, que son justo lo que espero de un juego de cartas de este tipo. Verá mucha mesa, estoy seguro. Muy muy recomendable.

Parade is an interesting card game with simple rules and hidden strategic depths. In our first game, I seemed to be winning by a huge margin the entire time, but when the points were tallied, my husband's score was within two points of mine. He probably would have won if he had been able to bust my only majority. My rating of 7 might rise as we explore this game more thoroughly.

I have the Z-Man edition with the purple cover. The cards are beautiful. I find the deck to be slightly stiff for shuffling, but I'm happy with the overall quality.

Maybe not quite as thinky as Arboretum but almost as good. Parade is basically about trying to punch yourself in the crotch as gently as possible.

Parade has a lot of agonizing decision points but with relatively low rules overhead. And the art is fantastic! 

You lay out  six cards to make the "parade". On your turn, you add one card to the end of the parade. Then, the value on the card you played equals the number of cards that are safe, or unremoved, from the end of the parade. However, any card with a value at the front that is equal to or less than the value on your played card or matching in card color, must be taken into your display and count as points. Which is bad because Parade is all about golf scoring - points are bad, mkay? The game ends when one player has all colors in their display or when the deck runs out.

What's particularly cool is that all cards, regardless of their value can be useful, depending on when they are played. The game is a constant exercise in damage control which is where the agony comes in.

My only complaint is that the cards, while linen-finished, are quite flimsy. Other than that, this would be a fantastic add to anyone's collection.

Another in the typical Japanese mold of "clever mechanism, middling game," but this one is a little better than the others I've tried. I'd like to try it with two or three players, to see if the added tactics improves my opinion.  With a larger table, I'd play it but not suggest it. Parade reminds me of 6 nimmt, even though play is sequential not simultaneous. It has a similar feel to the scoring, the hand management, and the way that each card is strong or weak depending on the tableau situation. Rating still uncertain.

This little Carroll-themed game seems innocent and childlike, but there's a bit of unexpected depth here making this a nice if fairly quick little card game.

Players must play a card and draw a card if possible each turn, until either one player has at leats one card in each suit or the draw pile is exhausted.

But the layers of the play, either avoiding captured cards, capturing only certain suits, or trying for as many as possible, while not leaving too easy pickings (if possible) are what add the thought in.

It plays fairly quickly until the scoring, where players drop two cards from their final hand, retain the other two cards with captured cards and then compare to generate a total negative score, with the highest score winning.

I'm starting this at a 7 after two plays; the theme (such as it is) appeals, and the unexpected tactics of the play make this a nice addition to the Z-Man stall of card games.

Pretty good filler.  I really like the scoring with the suicidal fight for majorities.

There is no theme.  And the way you collect cards is a little odd.

I much prefer the author's intended end-game to the end-game included in the initial English rules.  It was intended to CHOOSE 2 of your last 4 cards to score instead of just selecting 2 at random.

I'm not sure it's the same caliber as Coloretto or Fairy Tale, but then again I keep thinking about it.

A clever little trick-avoidance game.  With the full complement, its a little chaotic, but there is still adequate tactical decision making to provide some entertainment.  The novelty is in the way the design rewards the play of all ranges of cards depending on the circumstance ofthe "parade."  The illustrations are lovely, of course, but it would have been nice if there was at least some tangential connection to game play.

Sort of Guillotine meets David & Goliath.  Play cards in a line and possibly collect cards from the line based on what you played.  Whoever has the most of a color (there are six) scores one point per card.  Everybody else scores face value (0 to 10).  Fewest points wins.  I probably won't be clamoring to play, but I could probably be drawn into a game.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (September 2016)

I had no idea Parade existed before playing it, but I (kind of) enjoyed it.

Parade´s art is great, but I’m not sure if Humpy Dumpty has anything to do with Alice? (perhaps the egg refers to another character? I’m not sure), still, it doesn’t matter, the art serves no practical purpose in the game. You could play with numbered cards and nothing changes. The theme is paper thin.

The rules are uber easy, you can teach it under 2 minutes, which makes it perfectly for non-gamers and/or family. Playtime is around 20 minutes.

Parade´s decisions aren’t hard at all, but you have to think carefully which card to play. What I meant to say is that the game has some hidden depth to it. There is luck of the draw but as it plays so fast I don’t mind, besides, I’m sure you can mitigate it with clever play.

Bottom line, Parade is a good game for the family. I would have liked it much more a year ago, but the current me :D, is tired of light cards games. Still, I’m willing to play again if requested

Current Rating: 5.5

We were fooled by the art and simplicity of the game.  Bought on a recommendation, a little unsure.  This has become a favorite, almost daily, game.  A lot of thought and strategy.  My husband and I are a good match.  He usually wins, which makes this inexpensive, small game a definite keeper!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Quick, fun card game involving playing numeric cards in 6 suits onto a display in such a way that you avoid picking up cards while forcing others to do so. 

Tactical rather than strategic. I find the weird, completely irrelevant Lewis Carroll theme strangely appealing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
- I rate this highly mostly because of how versatile it is.
- It plays 2-6 players very well at all player counts. Not many games can boast this.
- It's also pretty easy to teach and play, and yet there's a fair amount of strategy and tactics, plus a bit of push-your-luck thrown in.
- It also looks great and is super simple to setup and pack away. I don't bother with the scorecard, so I can easily put the whole thing in a baggy and put it in my pocket, making this an excellent travel game. It does take up a little table space though.
- I think I like this most with 2 players as the majority rule requires a 2 card majority. This makes the game feel much tighter, and enables some sneaky sabotage right at the end. There's also no king-making with 2, which can happen with more players.

RATING: 6
Every turn you play a card, making the obvious, least damaging choice. You do that again and again until the game ends. There really is only one, maybe two, "best" plays in a turn. This is more like a game a solitaire where you try to "see" the best move rather than having substantial decisions to make. I enjoy it, but I enjoy solitaire as well. People either enjoy this game well enough, or they hate it with a passion beyond all reason!

Weird card game, thus the weird Alice in Wonderland artwork is quite appropriate even when the game itself is abstract. The card play of adding one card to a row, 'securing' a number of cards equal to the card number just played, then having to take each non-secured card of the same color and equal or lower numbers combined with the original scoring mechanism add up to a counter-intuitive, unique playing experience. The game leaves me wondering how much influence a player has and which importance luck-of-the-draw has.

Seeing the ugly German version, the artwork is necessary for my enjoyment.

Initial comments 4/2010: A very interesting game that I would like to play more, especially since it is one of those very unintuitive card games.  The theme is absolutely irrelevant, though I guess having Alice in Wonderland characters is better than pirates or European merchants or something.

The typo they made in the rules is pretty huge, I would like to play again with the correct rules.  Right now the main thing that bothers me is continually having to count down the card line, which slows things down and seems to really interrupt the flow of the game, which should be much quicker paced.

Update 12/10: After a couple more games, it is evident that this is better at the lower player counts (2/3).  With that many players, I'm willing to push the rating up to a 7.  I would choose a different game with 5 or 6 for sure.

Like with Cavum, Ben Chally's article convinced me to pick this up. This is a tremendous 2p game with many virtues: simple rules, easy setup, elegant design, highly portable, quick play, and agonizing choices. It slowly gets more chaotic, and less strategic, as you add players. This is a good game, and a real gem with two.

When I introduced a friend who prefers deeper games, he made his first move, then I made my move, then he took a long pause and said "Okay, I _really_ like this."

If you expect to find an Alice in Wonderland related theme, you'll be disappointed. The theme is very light close to non-existent. However, the game mechanics is excellent, combined with beautiful art. In a way, if you like traditional card games, this will be up there. We like it and small enough for travels.

Alice in Wonderland glued on theme of a hand management card based game. On your turn play a numbered card and count cards down the parade. If you finish before you reach your number great! If you're not so lucky see if any of the cards are the same color of your card or equal to or less than the card number you originally played. Points are bad in this fine filler game!

RATING: 8
This is a game where it'll take a couple of tries before you get the gist of it. However, its really good. It allows for strategical thinking and elements of Luck. having played with 3 players its really good, I'd guess two players the luck factor increases far too high as it'll come down to being lucky at the right time. 3+ however luck reduces a bit and knowing when to have people walk away from the parade will help the end game.

Scoring for this game is similar to golfing, the lowest score wins, So bare in mind you don't want to have the parade show up to your side of the table.

As discussed by others on BGG this is a fun little game that becomes quite interesting in two player. It is simple but has some interesting dyanmics. Can be played with any six suited deck with 0-10, but the custom deck is fun to play with, if not perfect.

I look forward to playing this with more than two, but I would only recommend it if two player is likely.

RATING: 6
Played once, 4p.  Certainly not a terrible game, and slightly better than I expected in fact.  But I think the strategy is deceptively shallow - you have less control than you think, and would get worse with additional players.  I could be wrong, and a dozen games might reveal the long term strategy considerations, but I won't ever get there.  There are simply so many better card games out there...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
LIKES:

* plays quickly
* easy to understand rules
* some choice in whether or not to collect cards of a color or try to slough off as long as possible - the parade aspect of this game is an interesting mechanism in a card game (play a card to the end of the line of cards, count back as many cards as the value of the card played and consider the remainder of cards - anything same color or less than or equal to original card is claimed and will score against you later).
* Appears to play well with two!

DISLIKES:

* Randomness of card draw can play a significant role.  However, this is something that plagues many card games and this one plays quickly enough that your pain is short-lived.

A fun little card game that seems quite counter-intuitive the first few hands you play, but afterwards is very easy to "get." The mechanics of the game reward clever use of the cards in hand so you never feel like you are forced in any way to play a bad card. The artwork is also quite attractive in the second edition from Zman. A fun little card game that I would recommend, and maybe even purchase if I didn't have too many of those already.

Great artwork based around the Alice in Wonderland theme.  Cards are laid down next to each other across a table (which I've found can require a rather long table).  Each card has a color, number (points) and character on it.  You will need to place a card each turn at the end of the parade.  In a nutshell, if there are other characters (cards) in the parade that share the same number, color or character, you need to pick them up and place them in front of you.  These are now points that count against you.  This is one game where you don't want points.  While they are inevitable, the idea is to walk away with the least amount.  I enjoyed the game a heck of a lot more after the second play-through.

Felt like a brain burner at first. Totally interesting and engaging. Games can be exceedingly quick, if someone grabs up a lot of colors quickly. Usually that's by accident (no take backs! "a card laid is a card played" in this game). But it can be on purpose, also. Whatever helps you to win. Fun ways to win and score minimal points for such a simple game.

The other super pretty Zman games game! But I like this one better because the gameplay is slightly better. And it’s a cool theme.

There is a parade that you are adding to, trying not to have people leave the parade and come sit with you. It’s like the opposite of homecoming. There are cards numbered 1-9 in five different colors (I think those are right). When you add on to the parade, cards of the same color and number as the one you played will come sit with you if there were near the front with a lot of people in the parade. At the end, you score points based on the value of the people with the lowest winning. If you have the most of a color, each card only counts as 0.

That was a really bad rules recap. You should check Erin’s or look at the actual game.

Only a couple of plays so far but the game is deceptively simple.  Just play a card, try not to get too many points, with majorities in a color important to avoid taking anything too big.  The whole negative point scoring bugs me a little - why not keep everything positive and say that lowest score wins?  Why do they need to be negative points you get?  Looking forward to playing this some more.  Its portability and length mean it should see quite a few plays.
UPDATE: boy did it get some plays. For a while the go-to game on the couch, we played it a LOT and got a lot of fun out of it. The novelty has worn a little but it still comes out especially as a 2 player game, once in a while (so portable that it is easy to bring anywhere). The multi-player game might have a little problem in that it is possible to duck the whole game. What is great about 2 or 3 players is that you can't duck the bad cards the whole game and knowing when to take or duck is key. But with 5 or 6 someone can do it all game and it fizzles a bit. A variation to encourage taking cards (where a majority scores positive instead of negative) made things a little more interesting at higher player counts.

RATING: 7.5
Lovely small card game in the topsy-turvy world of Alice in Wonderland. 

Alice is holding a parade and on your turn you play a card (with one of 6 characters numbered 0-10) to the tail end of the parade. The number on the card you played denotes the number of characters from your card forwards that are safe from leaving the parade. Any other card of the same colour, or number or lower beyond that will leave and join your scoring cards in front of you.

This game is fun and has a lovely twist in the scoring whereby if you have collected the most cards of a colour each card in that suit becomes a value of 1, rather than the number on the card. Lowest score wins. I'm probably not explaining it very well as I just don't play this game very well but it is extremely enjoyable.

I just don't have the ability to decide when I should switch from trying to get as few cards as possible leaving the parade to trying to collect the most of a colour so they all become "1's" for scoring. My ineptitude is almost as entertaining as the game.

One I will always play and always lose!

To me, this game is a simple, albeit elegant card game. To others I've played with, it's a real brain-burner. Either way, Parade is a tense little game with a huge amount of strategy. In fact, despite being a card game, I would estimate that Parade is about 70% skill/30% random. A long game is about 30-40 minutes, and a short game can be done in 5-10. What a gem!

P.S. Because this game can induce AP, I think it is best with 2-3.

Update 4/14:

Did I mention that this game is elegant? I can't believe that such a simple game could be such a brain-burner. It's also incredible how well thought out/playtested this game was. Everything meshes extremely well, and the game is completely balanced (there is no best card). If this is on your radar at all, just get it!

RATING: 6
It reminds me of Guillotine without the special abilities, and with a number of Knizia-like elements added. Fun light game with some nice decisions to make. But it really feels like luck of the cards can decide the winner more often than skill. Maybe additional plays will disprove that notion.

Played once with four players. There is no way the game is best with this player count. It is far too positional. You want to go after the worst player. Also, you can't plan ahead much, if at all. The endgame is moderately interesting as you can set your hand up to steal a majority. Would like to play again with two players.

This quick little card is a lot of fun and involves some interesting decision making. It's cheap, easy to carry and plays quickly but has enough depth to keep me interested.

I'm not a massive fan of the Alice in Wonderland art, but it really neither adds nor detracts from the game.

Well worth considering as a game to play over lunchtime.

It takes up to six players so also has a lot of versatility.

A simple, but interesting card mechanism which lands the game somewhere between Arboretum and No Thanks.  The cards are beautiful on both the front and back in a classic, 19th century way.

Clever little filler. Reminds me of Coloretto in a lot of ways, with a pinch of Guillotine sprinkled in. I think I may prefer this one slightly, as you have a little more control over what cards you take. Plus the Z-Man edition is a really nice production. The only downside is that the rules are a little quirky, and the numbered cards means that this isn't as approachable as Coloretto is.

A great filler. The cardplay has a nice balance between luck and skill. Some complain about the two random cards which are added to your scoring piles at the end-game, but I really like this element as it adds another layer of strategy regarding which 4 cards you want in your hand at the end of the game. Sure, this can be played with any deck of cards that has 11 cards of 6 suits, but the graphics are decent and the game is very color-blind friendly, which is a huge plus in my book! **UPDATE** So the rules have been officially changed and you're able to choose which 2 cards you keep at the end... oh well - either way, this is a very fun game! **UPDATE** I continue to love this game after 50 or more plays. I do want to try the "try to score points" variant we made up, but we usually play with at least one new person.I have yet to find someone who hasn't at least liked the game - the usual reaction at cons is for them to immediately purchase a copy of their own.

I thought I loved this game with 3, but it did get a bit hard to plan ahead in any good way...than I read someone's article here on the geek and played it with 2 and was really happy with my purchase.

The mechanics are a bit strange to wrap your head around at first, but once it clicks, it works because you are still striving to be as strategic as possible.  Is my opponent collecting Red and going to take all the points (which is BAD) and such.

Fun card game.

This is a wonderful little card game that can handle up to 6 players.  It's a fun mix of [gameid=5782], [gameid=432], and [gameid=354].  It doesn't try to do too much.  It's hand-management done really well, with a quirky scoring system that leads to many painful decisions, the opportunity to trigger the end-game early with clever play, and a twist in the final round that keeps everyone guessing till the end.  If played in the right spirit, this game is a guaranteed 30  minutes of fun.

One reservation:  If you have any players prone to AP, 'encourage' them to play quickly.  I can't imagine taking more than 5-10 seconds on a turn in this game.  But, I've seen people agonize for several minutes, trying to decide which card to play.  I usually try to encourage people who I know tend to over-analyze to think ahead during other players' turns.  In this game, however, the situation on the table can change drastically at any time, making it difficult to plan ahead.  That being said, most players shouldn't have any trouble playing this game quickly.  Just know your group.

Rather underwhelming and frustrating card game with mechanics that seem crowbarred in, rather than integral. Very much boils down to a game of 'which of these five cards would benefit me most right now?', and is too driven by the card draw, especially at the endgame. Whoever thought up a 'negative points only' scoring system deserves to be shot.

[b]Parade[/b] was received in a math trade (4/14/14).

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]One of my favorite trick taking card games. Parade is an excellent 3p game and one that my dad, son and I have played a lot. I grew up playing a lot of traditional trick takers with my dad (Cribbage and Spades especially) and Parade was the first non-traditional trick taker I decided to teach him. He really enjoyed it after the first few plays and from there I've taught him a bunch of new card games we play with my kids. However; this is still his favorite of the bunch and one my son also really likes. 

On top of that the art in the new Z-MAn version is perfect, the card quality is great. It also plays quickly (probably 20 minutes a game) so we either play a couple of games of Parade or get in 1 play before playing a longer game. 

I can't recommend this highly enough, especially if you are already a fan of traditional card games. Definitely another evergreen in our collection.[/i]

- Really fun card game that has the simple rule set of a game like Spades, but there is lots of depth to be found once you begin playing.
- Quick play time: 15 - 20 minutes.
This is currently my favorite trick taking game.[/i]

Unlike any other card game, mechanically. Big hit with the in-laws.

RATING: 7.5
Very clever card game. When one catches on to the scoring, one can begin to figure out the strategy involved, which is not lightweight. So, replayability should be fairly high for a 'filler' type game. 

As with most such card games, the theme is tacked on, but the 'Alice in Wonderland' artwork on the cards is pleasant. 

Played with my sister, a total gamer, in July 2013 and she rated it an "8". I agree with that rating. As for complexity, it's one step up from card games like "Rat-a-Tat Cat," which, by the way, is also a winner. Purchased new, on sale, December 2011.

RATING: 7
A card placement game where the aim is to avoid picking up cards from the parade row on the table, but if you're forced to pick up cards, try and pick up only 1 colour and win the most of it, because those cards are only then worth 1 point each rather than face value. The game moves at a nice pace - you only have 5 cards to choose from and it doesn't take long to work out the good/bad effects of playing each. Say the parade is 8 cards long. Playing an 8 or higher is safe. Playing a 5 say means you can't pick up any of the last 5 cards, but of those left, you pick up anything the same suit or anything less than or equal in value - which may still mean no pickups. The scoring rules provide the interest. As soon as you've started collecting a colour, you have to be careful that no one pips you as then you'd be scoring their face value. Meaning there's some watchfulness involved, some hand management and some tension. The neat thing is that both high cards and low cards can be good - high for avoidance, low to secure all the played cards in a suit and guarantee first for points minimisation. Avoidance (and getting lucky with good cards) is more the strategy with a high number of players, but planned "suit takes" with a low numbers of players will be required as you have too many turns to do avoidance forever and hand managements becomes more important. My early suspicion is that getting lucky with the cards is pretty key, but it's a very decent 20-30 effort and it provides a nice decision to make each turn.

RATING: 6
Neat quick card game with Alice in Wonderland artwork, with an interesting trick-taking mechanism, and with set collection by color for points players don't really want. Lowest score wins. Parade is of Knizia caliber, and plays well from 2 to 6 players.

3rd edition come with Cheshire Cat coasters.

RATING: 4
Some interesting mechanics, but tedious card-counting and the parade can get quite long, which makes table management a bit of a pain. The playing time for two players is about 10 minutes, maybe 15, definitely not an hour. Nice artwork. Good cards. Easy to shuffle.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Pros:
Quick, fun game that plays up to 6p.
Every round is like a buildup of tension/hope that someone will clear up the parade before it gets to your turn.

Cons:
Luck seems to play a big factor in determining the winner, but we like to laugh at each others' misfortune, so we don't mind too much for a filler game.

Great filler. 

Nice -Quick - & Easy. It makes you think about your every move but won’t let you go into an Analysis Paralysis mode. You can explain it in less than 5 minutes and you’re ready to go.  Love the artwork. 

The only aspect that can get tiresome is the counting of the parade cards and moving them to fill the gaps, but this is a minor MINOR complaint.
Just be warned. I was expecting to get the beautiful coasters but instead I got a useless and ugly scoring pad. 

(Wife's Point of View: She was pleased by the light feeling while at the same time you have to make some tough choices. She will play it any time. 

… although she got a bit frustrated on our first game, because I followed a strategy of getting the most cards in every color and beat her 29 to 30)

RATING: 7
A very simple game play, just place a card, count back that number of cards on the line and after that any cards that match in number or color you have to pick up. But you don't want to pick up cards and if you have to, you want to end up with the majority of that color in order to minimize the damage. It would be good to have a numbered mat since counting the cards was a little bothersome to some, but it is fun and you have to adapt to the others. Some luck due to the cards being drawn, but fun nonetheless.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is one of those card games where ideally you'd like to avoid taking any cards whatsoever, but in reality you just have to limit the damage the cards you take do.  I liked how, at different points of the game, the low- and high-valued cards were worthwhile, as they let you "duck" different types of cards in the middle.  It was neat that the procession actually felt a little like a parade, with the cards that people played slowly working their way to the front of the line.  I played with 3 people; I wonder how it would play with more.

RATING: 6.5
Interesting card game of avoiding points by skipping cards and taking those less than or equal to or matching color after the skipped cards in the parade.  It had a nice touch also adding the majority color holders to reduce all cards to one point each.

The parade of cards kept having to be shifted back into the middle due to play from one end and taking from the other.

I bought this for something light, yet strategic, for a group; and my one 5p game was fun.  But then I played it 2p, and the game was awesome!  The tone of the game was like Lost Cities, but far more subtle and strategic.  

With higher player counts I will likely go for Coloretto or No Thanks! over Parade.

Parade is an ultra-light card game, and something I can see myself playing over and over with family and non-gamer friends. Players are trying not to take cards from a central row, or to take the highest sum within a given color. Like many games of this style, it has a nice press-your-luck element. The cards and art in the new Z-Man edition are beautiful.

This game is a really good game opener since it plays from 2 to 6 and can be taught in 5 minuets. I had a blast playing this game and I will see more plays for sure.

RATING: 4
A game this light shouldn't plod so slowly. On your turn, you play a card at the end of a line of cards. If the rank of the played card is greater than the number of cards on the line, nothing happens. But if it's less, you skip over as many cards on the line as the rank of your played card, and then take (as penalty points) those cards that are left on the line that match your card either by suit or by rank.

Most of the game is wasted counting the number of cards on the line. So too much bookkeeping for such a light game.

This game actually irritates me. I think it is because of the frustration of suddenly finding yourself scoring face value for sets just when you think you're safe. There's pain, but not a lot of triumph. For a family game with an Alice theme, it's awfully dry. Too much counting, not enough fun.

Lovely 'Alice in Wonderland' themed card game. Add to the end of the parade. Any cards further ahead than your safe-zone (number of cards equal to your card value) may leave the parade (& count towards your score). Anything the same colour or of an equal value or lower will leave.

You don't want them to leave the parade as lowest score at game end wins!

The extra twist is by having the most cards in a colour in your score pile means you turn them over & they only count as one point each rather than the value on the cards, so there is some damage limitation available!

Parade is a very simple game, but it leaves much room for the exploration of tactical play in different scenarios, from turn to turn.  The scoring mechanism of winning-by-scoring-less-points isn't anything new to games at this point, but it works superbly in this game.  As many people have mentioned, the artwork is amazing.  There is no theme to the game really, but, if you take it for what its worth, its an amazing game.

This is a game where you want to avoid taking cards and involves a "parade" of cards and you take the cards placed on what you place in the last place.  This does have a bit of a learning curve in what you take, based on what you play, but once you know what to play, it plays face and quick.  It is a different mechanic, which is great. (JW)

Reasonably entertaining card game with a lot of luck in the cards and turn order. A bit of a gambling element to it keeps it entertaining. I've played with the correct scoring, but I think I'd prefer it with a scoring variant where the most cards in a suit gives you one positive point per card instead of one negative. Scoring in this way encourages more gambling / risk taking and mitigates the luck of a bad run of cards somewhat by giving you more play  options with the cards.

This game has an interesting play and collect mechanism that adds in some of the interesting bits of poison/sticheln.  Can lead to some long turns as you have to evaluate each of five cards on your turn as the board changes with each played card.  This of course gets much worse the more players that you add.  This also adds more chaos to the game.  The limited planning available due to the limited handsize (and changing hand contents) also limits the game for me.  Recognizing it for what it is is central to being able to enjoy it.  Without that, I think players will spend more time than they should in analysis.  Still, it is interesting, and I would be happy to play if given the opportunity, preferably with fewer number. [01/08/2011]

Alice in Wonderland - Parade -- Played once; four-player.

Will definitely need to make a numbered path to lay next to the parade before playing again.  This should eliminate the tedium of counting parade cards each turn and speed up the the play.  I think these two changes might bring the game into the realm of pleasant fillers.

I did terribly, but I liked the mechanic.

This is a thinky game that could cause a bit of AP as you try to figure out the best cards to play to either maximize your majority or not take a color at all.  Box time is right for 2-3 informed players, but think it will ratchet way up with 6, with a lot of down time between the other players, and less way to plan your next move when 5 others are going in between.

Nagyon szép kivitelű játék, a lila szín pedig kimondottan tetszett. De sajnos csak ennyi jót tudok elmondani a játékról. 6 színű lap van 0-tól 10-ig pontokkal. Egy sort bővítünk mindig, a végére letett lap előtt levő annyi lapot nem nézzük, ahányas a lap, onnantól viszont minden kisebb számú és ugyanolyan színű lapot magunk elé vesszük a sorból, ezután húzunk egyet a pakliból a kezünkbe. Mindenki ezt addig csinálja, míg valaki előtt nem lesz a hat színből vagy el nem fogy a húzópakli. A játék végén minden színből megnézzük kinél van a legtöbb, ő azokat darabonként 1 pontért számolja el, minden más lap annyiért ér, amennyi rá van írva. Akinek a legkevesebb pontja lesz az győz. Jól hangzik, van ötlet benne, de full random az egész, plusz még a királycsinálás is rendesen ott van. Nekem még taktikai játéknak se tűnt, mert hiába gondolok ki valamit, azonnal el lehet rontania a következő játékosnak. Nem jött be.

Not much to say. Its a trick "not taking" game. Its an interesting concept and I love the artwork. However, my group decided to play "blind" and realized that its a pretty random game (we did this several times for test). It really depends on what you draw. I mean, your best option might be to take 2-5 cards and then it comes back to you, thinking you wont get stuck again and it hits you again. thats the worst.

If slightly more skill was involved, Id rate this one much higher

Very light, simple card game.  It is a set majority/pain management game.  Knowing when to take cards is the trick.  It plays super fast, and is a little lucky, best to score a number of rounds as there are players with each player going first.

As I played more games, I realized the decision making in this game is most of the time shallow. I've heard this is a different game when played as a 2p game and I can see why (though I never tried). However, there are easily better 2p games out there if that's what you are looking for.

But it's still a very fun filler. Works very good with non-gamers.

I really like this game.  It is quite stressful and there is much more strategy here than you might imagine.  The more I play, the more strategies emerge.  I like how a card can change its value to you in the course of the game... a ten can be exactly what you need - or a very unwelcome card that can cost you dearly!
Amazing what can be done with a simple deck of 66 cards!

EDIT:  I only like this one as 2 player.  Lack of control and too much randomness interferes with higher player counts.  suffers from the "player to your right" problem.

A quick, fun little card game -- another one playable with a Sticheln deck! It's a nice filler, but having to count from the end repeatedly (after every player's card play) got a little old. Next time, will have to use a spare set of numbered cards to create a numbered path on which to play the Parade cards -- should make counting a lot simpler. 

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
•	0-10, 6 suits

•	Deal 5 cards per player.
•	Place 6 cards in a row on the table.
•	On your turn, add a card to the back of the line.

.	-	You collect each unsafe card of the same color as, or with the same or lower number than, the played card. 
	-	Place the cards you take into stacks (sort by color) in front of you.
•	Then, refill hand to 5 cards.
•	Final round:

Interesting scoring combined with the unique rules for taking crds realy makes you think.  Should you go for one color or try taking as few cards as possible?  If you do try for the majority in a color, you better make sure you succeed!  I ike it!

RATING: 6
I think the rules to this game are extremely clever and I can enjoy it for a play or two but it certainly doesn't grab me like some other light card games do.

The game is played by placing a card denoting a number and a color at the end of a line of similar cards.  The number denotes how many cards behind the placed card are "safe".  Past those "safe" cards you have to collect all cards that are not of a different color and higher number as the placed card.  At the end of the game the player with the fewest collected points wins.  One caveat to that is if you have the most cards of a particular color you receive only one point per card as opposed to its face value.

Super simple and very clever but kind of lacking in flavor compared to something like Love Letter or No Thanks.  The Alice in Wonderland characters on the cards do their best to help with that though.  Oh, and it comes with 6 drink coasters...just because.

RATING: 8
This was a game order throw in and what a nice find.  My family really enjoys playing this.  There's not a ton of strategic depth here but its just enjoyable.  While not a brain burner, it makes you think about the right cards to play.  Sometimes you want to avoid taking cards and other times taking certain cards isn't too harmful.  Need to play this more to figure out how to load up the parade to negatively impact other players and hopefully not yourself.

[Z-Man Games 15 Edition] {Alice in the Wonderland; hand-management, set-collection; optimal 4p} This is a decent filler for families!  Players have to collect cards from the display.  In this game, low cards are more beneficial.  The twist is about the scoring and winning - players need to have lowest score to win, but, in order to do so, they have to collect the most cards in a colour.  If they failed to do so but collect many cards, the sum of card value counts!!! That's evil.

It is simple to teach and set up the game.  The only difficulty is how to remind players which cards shall be removed from the Parade.  This is a filler for fun, so players have to accept the luck of draw :)

There is a cheaper edition with just numbers; but the the characters of Alice in the Wonderland are just so lovely!   This makes the game more expensive than necessary :P  And, honestly, the characters don't add much to the theme.

Got in trade at Essen '17. Very easy-going gameplay, with a lot of tactics rather than strategy. Unique way to determine which card you have to pick, and a good way to score your cards at game end. First imprssion: glad I got this in trade.

RATING: 8
Play a card; deal with it; draw a card. Simple stuff, but it works great. The 'deal with it' phase may have you picking up cards which count against you at game end. Obviously, your cards are sometimes just bad, but everyone's in the same boat. After some fence-sitting, I now prefer the corrected end game rules rather than the published version.

Light rules but still tricky, relaxed yet confrontational.  An enjoyable game that's always welcome at our table.  The theme may be tacked on, but it makes the cards appealing to fans of Caroll, a logician of note.  Too bad the illustrations weren't by Steadman.

This is a neat little game. Fun game, but the randomness of the two cards added at the end is a bit too much. I think choosing which two (of four) to add to your tableau or choosing one and randomly drawing the 4th might be a better way to end it. In the game we played, the game was absolutely decided by which two cards were chosen. Anybody could have won if the cards had gone in different directions. Regardless, it's a very nice filler.

RATING: 8
Much deeper than it's docile appearance....curiouser & curiouser...

This is quite an ambitious design,  especially when considering the foundation of the game's content.  Since the game is simply a deck of cards numbered 0-10 within 6 suits,  one might surmise there would likely be limitations in it's scope.  However,  that is not the case here.

This is a well crafted,  unique concept - that at first glance can be a bit difficult to wrap your head around.  There are times when low cards are valuable and others where they are not - the same holds true for high cards.  This continues to fluctuate based on the queue of cards ( the parade ) and it's ever changing content.  There is a lot going on, especially considering this all emerged from a small, unpretentious game box.

Parade may be poles apart from the bulk of card fillers on offer.  It is not as easy to teach as your standard card filler,  but it is worth the investment - as the end result is a more significant engagement.

My recommendation is that you give it a whirl and decide for yourself,  if in this instance, different necessarily means better.

The isle of Japan is apparently overflowing with wacky card games. Every year it seems Dale Yu regales us with the bountiful harvest of crazy Japanese card games that he buys at Essen in the hopes that one might resemble Fairy Tale, Satoshi Nakamura's gold standard of Japanese games. I wonder if Japon Brand or Grimpeur will ever run out of amusingly odd card games to publish each year, or if they'll ever give us another game that measures up to the bar set by Fairy Tale. This time it was Christian Leonhard who introduced me to a new wacky Japanese card game, and this time it was actually pretty good, in contrast to the many disappointments (I'm looking at you Gra Gra Company). Alice in Wonderland Parade was very light and fairly silly, but had a few decisions to be made at least, and depending on the way in which you interpret the "end of game" rules there might even be some tension in there as well. Similarly to Knizia's Poison, you're trying to avoid taking cards from a face-up pool generally, unless you can be the player with the most cards in a given color. Unlike Knizia's Poison, your play each turn isn't completely obvious, so you can't simply turn off your brain and daydream. I gather Parade is one of the rare Japanese games that is getting a U.S. release, so you'll hopefully be able to see it for yourself soon enough. I've also got a copy of Nakamura's Masquerade on the way, which I'm looking forward to trying out and reporting back on.

Very nice filler.

It's easy to teach and to learn. No garantees until the very end, so no runaway leader. The gameplay is fast (usually under 20 minutes), and can hold well up to 6 players (but I prefer it with 4).

Two cons: 1) There is [u]no[/u] theme (don't be fooled by the Alice in Wonderland pictures). 2) There is some downtime - not much, though. Just some mild AP.

So, overall, a good, good game.

I really like this game. The cards are beautiful. Instructions are simple, but can be confusing at first. Got the hang of it after a few tries. The coasters were a nice touch.

easy to play, a little more depth than it first appears.  plays really well with 2.  seems like it would be more chaotic and swingy and less strategic with more players, but i haven't played more than 2 yet.

RATING: 7.5
Card game with simple rules, play a card from the hand to the back of a line of cards, and take back qualifying cards from the front of the line as negative points. But, a really nice twist means that colours where you have the majority don't score face value, but only 1 point each instead. So, you're trying not to get cards, but sometimes, you want to get cards in order to get the majority, and turn that -28 points into -4.

Lots of "think" in a short time, I really liked this. Only problem might be the theme and the artwork, but for the price, you can't beat it.

Good, very clever, little card game both in regard to which cards to play and which cards (negative points) to take. Everything is both good and bad depending on the situation and the other players.

This game has a tricky little mechanism for cycling your cards in hand and the cards you collect, but there are other games with tricky mechanisms that are far more interesting.  Sticking strictly to the Japanese card games (which have mechanisms I don't see much in Eurogames), R-Eco does a much better job of it, is a little more challenging (at least in the sense of learning how best to cycle through the cards), and plays in a shorter amount of time.  Traders of Carthage is also a much better game using a tricky cycling mechanism, but it's not really a filler, when you get right down to it.  Regardless, Parade doesn't bring enough to the table to justify playing it when there are other, more interesting games of its type out there to play.

With 2 players, the game improves a bit, since it reduces it down to a min-maxing game where the main tactic is to get more of any one color than your opponent.  It's a lot thinkier than one would expect, though it still suffers some from the luck of the draw.  Still, it's short and brain-simmery, so it's not a bad diversion for when you only have two.

Additionally, what's up with the theme to this game?  It could have been about anything at all, but an Alice in Wonderland parade?  Really?

RATING: 6
Brain-bending. Easy to teach, hard to figure out good strategies (as opposed to turn-by-turn tactics). This difficulty seems to leave people a little frustrated and confused. 

The rules do not seem particularly intuitive, despite being simple. People constantly seem to make mistakes.

As others have noted, figuring out the likely impact of your plays increases exponentially with more players. Might try a few more games of heads up to see if the game gets better.

Feels quite dry, despite the beautiful cards.

The characters of Alice in Wonderland are having a Parade!
\13\\13\
On your turn, you play a card (from your hand of five) to the end of the parade. Unfortunately, that card might cause other cards to walk off the parade. These cards will count as negative points in the end.
\13\\13\
The length of parade line is important. If the number of the card you just played is less than the line length, you may receive the excess cards (counting from last played to the first of the line). But you do not take all cards, only the cards that meet one of these requirements:
\13\\13\
1. color is same as just played, or \13\
2. number is same or lower than just played\13\
\13\\13\
The game ends when all cards are played or when one player has collected all six colors in their point piles. Then everyone plays one last card. From the four cards remaining in their hand, they choose two cards to add to their point piles. The player who has the least negative points after this is the winner.
\13\\13\
Scoring:\13\
Normally, negative points are same the number on the card. But if you have the most cards in a certain color, each of your cards of that color counts only 1 negative point!
\13\\13\
Thus, play your cards well!

Cartas bonitas, se podían haber matado un poco más y poner una posición diferente en cada una de las cartas de personaje, el juego lo pedía.

El juego en si no está mal, y te hace calcular que carta poner y que te interesa conseguir según lo que hagan los demás.

Probably some memory/card tracking if you play often enough.

A simple game with a charming premise and even more charming theme and art. Five characters from Lewis Carrol's Alice In Wonderland represent suits of cards that players place in a parade. This one will be great for the little ones, but my groups adore these lite little games and so do I. There's much to be said in favour of stress-free gaming.

My wife loves this game, therefor I play this game.  It frankly isn't my favorite but it is easy to learn and fairly involved to play.  It is a card game with an Alice in Wonderland theme and the art is pretty cool.  It is deceptively deeper than it seems.

Had this for a while before playing it for the first time. It's a very quick game when you get your head around the rules of the removal mechanic, which doesn't take long.

Since playing it for the first time, it's been called for a few times as a good filler that doesn't take long and is pretty fun. 

Definitely happy it's part of my collection.

Such good value for money this game. I never, never, NEVER do well in this game though. As Rob mentionsed this game is a brain melter and not really for anyone other than gamers. As geoff stated, you really do go down the Rabbit-hole playing this game..The theme really fits. The art-work and game play are both outstanding and I will never part with this game.

RATING: 5.5
Two games in, it's safe to say that Parade is at best a harmless diversion.  If you draw nothing but high cards, you'll nearly always do well - as long as everything works out in terms of the previous player leaving you in a reasonable position.

The endgame requirement for players to add two cards from their hands to the table is by far the tensest decision that players need to make - although even then the card choices might be obvious.

Even though it really is up the deck gods, I love this quirky game. An anti set collection game. Love it. You can mitigate your hand to a certain extent, but I have found this feels to be the game of "which card hurts me the least"? This one really surprised me and everyone who has played it with me seems to love it.

A simple card game that is easy to learn, but contains quite a lot of depth. The theme is pasted on and it is therefore more of an abstract game. Components are good quality and very attractive.

Deciding which cards to play and which to keep at the early stage to maintain as much flexibility in the hand for later stages seem to be the key to winning. The scoring system also forces players to observe one another's collected cards. Short playtime is another plus point.

I have to admit being swayed by the art (and I'm an Alice in Wonderland fan, so there's definitely a bias). This really is a fun little game though - moving the parade along is a bit fussy (though not on the level of Fungi/Morels), but I can see this being an easy one to pick off the shelf. Felt more chaotic and less cut-throat than Arboretum, but there's definitely room for it in the collection - particularly when it's so beautifully presented.

Not sure whether this is totally random or there is actually something you can plan... At least the one time I tried a two player game simply sucked as I never had any chance to do anything meaningful and just got huge loads of cards - well, that is luck of cards for ya, I guess. Anyway, I will try some more multiplayer sessions.

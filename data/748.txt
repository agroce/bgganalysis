A recent discovery this is a fun quick playing little abstract.  I think that programmers will love it.  The trick seems to be the forced moves.  The thrill could possibly wear off after repeated playings, but not yet..  (04/21/08 thrift find)

I've learned to recognise \-/ as a potential win and have started anticipating the 'automatic moves' more fully. There's still the occasional one that surprises me, though.

The two goals work well in tandem. Interestingly, moving closer to one can take you further from the other. Half-hearted attempts just mess you up entirely!

Like a balancing act, you need to keep your opponent 'in the middle'.

I hope/think there's still some sort of sudden sparks of enlightement.

Abstracto decente. Tiene la "desventaja" de que su falta de azar hace que el mejor jugador tienda a ganar siempre, haciéndolo repetitivo y aburrido a veces, pero por otra parte, nunca se pierde la sensación de que se podría haber hecho mejor, y se juega tan rápido y fácil que merece la pena. Buenos materiales.

It took me a while to really get Trax.  I think that I was expecting the rules to be more complex than they really were and was thus projecting my biases.  Once I got past that problem however I fell in love.  I prefer to play the 8x8 game over the infinite game, but both are wonderful.

I like the tiles, which remind me of Metro, but luckily they each contain two colors (for the two players).  I can visualize the patterns a little better here than in Metro, but it's still difficult for me to form a strategy or even to play well tactically.  This also seems a little like Zertz in that a better player usually can set me up to fail and I don't even notice.

A very forced tile-placement game. It just seems like every turn you're trying "not" to make a mistake. And the first person who makes a mistake loses the game. With enough play, I'm sure most players will just be trying to set-up their positions. Very dry.

This kind of game doesn't seem to be my thing. OK, so here, unlike Kaliko or Tantrix, you're not spending your time trying to work out what's even a legal move. Instead you have n-in-a-row-style sudden death and reading ahead to avoid losing patterns that allow for winning sequences of automated moves. I'd play this before any of the other games, but win or lose I'd be wondering what it was for.

Connection games are not my favorite.  Trax allows for loops as well, but somehow it just falls flat for me.  I'm sure there is a game there, but it feels forced even if it is not.  The pieces are nice and rules are simple and clean, so it has redeeming characteristics, too.  Perhaps my rating might go up after further play and discovery of strategies, but I just am not inclined.

Very refined tile-laying abstract where the goal is to achieve a loop or connect two borders of the 8x8 square board that builds itself during the game. The game is a bit of a grower: even though it takes hardly half a minute to explain its rules, a certain amount of plays are needed to discover the increasingly subtle strategies within. The bad side of it is that two players without much experience will end up drawing or stalling the game more often than not.

Highly original abstract (despite being first published in 1980).

Rules are easy to grasp and plays very quickly. Steep yet accessible learning curve because games move and end very quickly.

If you had to choose between Tantrix and Trax, pick Trax. There is none of the frustration of Tantrix of simply not having the tile for that killer play since in Trax there's only one kind of tile!

(BTW, pick Kaliko over Tantrix!)

Played some online and decided to buy it 2007-06-30.  2-player pure strategy game of tile placement to close a loop or make a long line meeting certain conditions, with very simple rules and pieces, but non-obvious strategy.  When I first encountered Trax, I thought its rules and components were so simple that it couldn't offer much diversity, but it seems to.  I've seen plays of it develop in quite different interesting ways.  It also makes a huge difference whether you play with unlimited tiles and grid or restricted to an 8x8 grid; both are interesting, in different ways.

RATING: 8.5
Probably the best "I'll buy that for a dollar!' experiences I've had, as I bid on it in a games auction where nobody else had an inkling what it was.

Also the best game I've played where there is only one type of component, a tile that has two trax going from corner to corner in white and blue, and another side where they are straight lines that cross. But by playing these pieces, one side or another, along with the forced placement rule that lets you combo a bunch of placements when only one type of tile will fit there, you can surprise the other player with a cascade of placements that help you get a victory very quickly.

Lots to think about, and yet if you're not careful and think ahead you can accidentally give the opponent the victory with one bad move. Very cool game.

The forced tiles make this more than boring.  I think that the more you play this the better you will get at it, but sadly I feel that you will get better only in memorizing the reprocussions of patterns and layouts rather than from understanding strategies.  I just don't think that this game allows for players to make "wrong moves" without losing to a player that knows how to take advantage of the pattern.

My only real complaint about the game is that I feel like it should have more tiles included in the set...there have been quite a few games that I've played where it has come down to getting the line from side to opposite side, which feels almost anticlimactic.  I'd rather play until one user can form a loop.

My desire to have more tiles took me to Ebay, where I got a second set for $9.22 with shipping...hopefully that will satisfy my desire for more tiles.  The website doesn't sell the red tiles anymore, so if I buy more sets there, it would have to be the black tiles.

Trax is a two player abstract strategy game of loops and lines. It can be played on any flat surface (no board): 
using identical square tiles with straights on one side 
and curves on the other. The rules of TRAX are simple: place tiles adjacent to those already in play such that the colours of the tracks match. The objective is to get a loop or line of your colour while attempting to stop your opponent in their colour. What gives Trax its strategic depth is the forced play rule which allows (or even requires) multiple tiles to be played in a turn.

Seconds to learn how to play - it feels like playing noughts and crosses cos it is so simple - but it's quickness is its advantage.  May get a draw a lot if playing against equally matched person.

Deceptively simply, but intensively strategic because there is NO luck involved.

The tiles are very nice and this is a fun abstract. I am enjoying Tantrix slightly more at this time.

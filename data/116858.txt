Fantastic filler title, good for both adults and children. Can be a friendly cooperative game when children are playing, and a cutthroat strategic experience for seasoned gamers. 

Unfortunately, the scoring mechanism is REALLY awkward. Players accumulate tears when they lose an animal, and some animals are worth more tears than others... Mechanically, this was completely unnecessary, and thematically it is just plain broken. The idea that some animals have more value than others is entirely antithetical to the tale of Noah's Ark.

This is a 10/10 game that takes a hit in my rating for lackluster component quality, a hefty price tag, and a really ugly point system. 

Plan on replacing the player tokens.

My daugther loves it and wants to play it regularly, I kindly play with her when she ask me but I must admit I prefer other easy card games. It's ok but I'm eager to play other fillers with my daugther.

*update*

17 games in less than three months is the best covert letter to explain how much my daughter (5 yr) loves this game, I don't know what's the reason for this because I think that she is too young to understand all the tactics but, on the other hand, she beats me one after another.

Most amortized game in my collection 3€ / 17 games = 0,18€ per game... and we keep playing it  :)

For alot of people I think this was the suprise hit of the night. I wasn't suprised and I'm a big fan of these little tin games.

It's an interesting concept but found it to be strange in that Noah had to be moved from dock to dock each turn following movement rules that had no meaning to them. The entire game feels very luck-driven and reactionary. The artwork is nice, but overall this game wasn't very enjoyable. An okay game to play with the kids to pass the time, though there are much better alternatives.

Interesting little game similar to poison in that you are hoping to force your opponent to overfill the ark and have to pick up cards. 

The interesting twist in this one is that the card you play moves Noah which dictates which ark your opponent has to play on. special abilities on some of the cards are nice and are flavour full i.e. the giraffe lets you look at a players hand since it is so tall and can peek over. 

Artwork is really cute :)

My kids think is absolutely the most adorable, cute game they have ever seen.  The cuteness of the animals Noah is trying to save is provides a high degree of motivation to save them from the flood, especially when each point counted against you if you don't save the animal is symbolized by a teardrop.  Besides the great artwork, the game is decent, and plays out like a more gamer-friendly version of UNO.  There's not much strategy and a lot of luck, but there is at least some illusion of control.  This is strictly for the family market.

RATING: 6.5
Components: ok components, lovely box
Complex: easy to learn and teach
Weight: family
Players: 4
Length: around 30 mins
Mechanics: get rid off your cards
Decisions: enough for this game
Opinion: is a funny familiar game to be played in family meetings. You have to fill the arks so Noah can save the animals. To do so you have to play one card from your hand and move Noah to the appropriate Ark to be filled. Each card is male or female, and has different weight depending on the animal, and some of them have also special abilities. In each ark animals can be all of the same genre, or alternating male/female.
With this, you have a lovely family game with nice art. You have to decide if you play a high weight animal or a smaller but lovely one (in the end you get penalties for how cure are the animals you could not save). Also, depending on your group, the game can be really mean...making them to draw more cards as they cannot play any, and the special abilities make the game greater (woodpecker makes the ark lighter, lion steals cards, snails can be male or female)

Present to my nieces (ages 8 & 10). It went down quite well! Not all that complex but a little wonky: it can drag on for too long - or be over all of a sudden... mostly due to the fact that you have to take ALL cards on a ferry if you can't play an animal.

Noah is a neat little filler game that runs just a bit long.  It seems that players can create a nearly unending loop once they get some kind of idea of what their opponents have in hand.  As well, the penalty for not being able to play a card seems a bit harsh (more so in a 5 player game).  Otherwise, I find it to be quite enjoyable.

Un jeu de cartes qui plaît à beaucoup, mais que je trouve (bien) trop long, notamment sur les fins de parties. L'édition est en revanche très réussie.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
You play cards one by one on 1 of 5 ferries to try to fill it to the right weight. Every time you add a card Noah moves to a different ferry - the choice depends on the last card played. Then the ferry departs to the ark and you get to fill another. You have to fill male/female alternate or single sex boats. 

The game is about manipulating where you want Noah to go, remembering what your opponents do and trying to force them not to be able to go in which case they get all the cards on that ferry. The idea is to get rid of your cards. Scoring is then based on what is left in hands which scored against the players.

It's fun, you can mess with the other players and try to manipulate your hand to leave what you most likely need.

I bought this as a family game. It has a biblical theme so we can start the game by telling the kids about the story of Noah. My 7-year old son was able to play it and add the numbers and abide by the rules. But he preferred to collect cards rather than get rid of them. My 16-year old step-daughter with Autism had a hard time with this game. She required a lot of coaching. The game drug on longer than normal because we made her count every time it was her turn. Basically, I would tell her her options, and then she would make her play. I don't think that will change.

RATING: 5.5
A decent filler game consisting of cute animals and a sprinkling of chaos. In this game, players aim to exhaust their hand of 8 cards by loading ferries with animals. Of course, there are some wrinkles in the path - players may only play a card to the ferry where Noah is currently presiding, and have to obey a strict gender rule and weight limit. If players have no legal move, they end up taking all the cards in that ferry! Alternatively, any player who plays the last card which satisfies the ferry's weight limit gets benefits as well.

There's a surprisingly high screwage factor in the game since Noah moves around pretty unpredictably. If players are constantly getting penalised, then you can expect the game to drag a little. Its rules may a bit complicated for young kids, but there isn't much depth here to keep adults interested.

This really was a filler game when we purchased it online. Adding an extra game to the order would be cheaper then paying the shipping costs. Of course it had to be a small and cheap game to reach that goal. We decided to buy this one, as it looked interesting. Graphics on this one are a bit childish, but after watching a short review, we were sure, the game itself wouldn’t be childish. It arrived and we started playing. Easy rules, but a lot of mathematic and tactics is going on during this game. Something like: ‘If I play a female there, I can place Noah to the right, so the other player has to place a female at the bottom of the row, so Noah has to move to the left of the right which give me a 50% chance that I can place the male Rhino at the bottom of that row and that way, the arc can set sail!’ This game was a big surprise to us, and it’s one we can recommend to anybody.

Very pretty and attract people to the table. Great game for introducing brand new players who can take slightly more complicated rules.

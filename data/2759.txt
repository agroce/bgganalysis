A very good abstract but it can't compete for my attention with Chess and Go. This will get played and enjoyed occasionally

One of my favorite connection games. So much game comes out of simply taking turns putting pieces on the board, and interesting victory conditions.

RATING: 9
I haven't played this game much yet, but I'm already deeply impressed. Basically, it's a blend of Hex and Trax; works like clockwork. Like all good abstract games, it has simple rules, but much depth. I assume that I eventually will give this game the highest grade. A criminally underrated and forgotten game, which deserves more attention and recognition.

Similar to hex, but  I enjoy hex so much more. Hex seems more simple and pure.

I've never been a fan of connection games.  After playing Havannah, I think I understand what about it makes it better that other similar games.  It's been mentioned but bears repeating - one player's winning condition does not stop the other player from winning quicker.  So you aren't always forced into a tit-for-tat game of response - sometimes you can let the other side build a bit, if you think you can make a quicker-winning setup with your pieces.  I really like this aspect of the game; it seems to make it slightly more strategic in nature, something I feel other connection games really lack, being entirely tactical.

I play on IG Game Center.

Very good abstract game, deeper than the first plays might make you think.  Simple rules, the plastic components and the box art are not too attractive.

Similiar to hex with a hexagon board. Connect 3 sides to win.
So many connection games....why bother with this one?
Out of my collection.

RATING: 8
A neat connection game with intuitive rules. Blocking is more difficult than other connection games, so it is more of a race. I've found that new players like this better than Hex.

RATING: 8.2
A connection game with three different win conditions. One of Christian Freeling's best contributions (I feel), in that he put effort into promoting the game via his competition with programmed AI. Another reason I really need to get a hex-hex board.

RATING: 5.5
Very similar to Hex, with a couple of added twists. It somehow failed to grab me, as did Hex for that matter. OK-ish, but nothing special.

This game no longer subsumes Hex and Y for me.  I've grown to appreciate their elegance while at the same time souring (just a little tiny bit) on the racing-feel of Havannah.  It's still a great game though.

[2014.10.10] - 8.75
Subsumes Hex, Y, and Six for me.  It's a brain-burner, but in that exquisite way.  I look forward to playing 100 more games ASAP!

RATING: 7
Havannah is a very nice take on the whole Hex "connection game" idea. Why have one objective when you can have 3? I really enjoy being able to work on multiple goals or at least fake out my opponent into thinking that I'm working on one thing while completing another. So, obviously not as pure as Hex but super intriguing and a solid variation!

Well, I play it on the hex board that came with Ingenious.  We like the multiple victory conditions, it's easy to teach, and quick.

RATING: 5
Similar to Hex but achieves hexagonal symmetry, which appeals to me. However, the fact that the two players do not globally have mutually exclusive connection goals, but are racing to complete their chains, means Havannah seems slightly less elegant.

RATING: 6.9
Fun and heavy in strategy. 
However I love Hex mainly for its simplicity, which doesn't hinder the deepness. Havannah tries to improve on Hex and in my opinion achieves the opposite effect. For a better "children" of Hex look at *Star.

I enjoy abstracts and this is a good one.  Three ways to win the game and a very good strategy guide are included in the rules.  I would definitely study this game more if I didn't own so many games already...

The box cover art is yucky though - ugly, ugly, ugly...

RATING: 10
This rating is based on about 50 postal games played since 2003 on www.mindsports.nl. This game should be ranked up there with Go because Havannah is the equivalent of Go for connection games. Simple, scalable, fun to play, computer resistant and its very deep. I congratulate Christian Freeling on creating such a classic game.

RATING: 8
A modern classic abstract connection game I'd heard about for a while but hadn't tried until the "mix and match" online abstract tournament. The 3 different ways to win add a nice race element so that it's not enough to secure an unbreakable connection (e.g. as in Hex or Twixt), but you must do it [i]faster[/i] than the opponent. The 3 conditions feel a bit arbitrary and there's wonky details about how the corners don't count as sides (as they normally would in a connection game) - but it's a case of "it works well in practice even if it's slightly inelegant".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Feels like a cousin of Hex and Game of Y. If you don't mind the ugly colors of the Ravensburger version, here's an unexpensive, top-notch connection game, that gets played here more often than Twixt or Pünct.

Someone described Hex as a knife fight in a phone booth. If you have claustrophobia you should try this Hex variant. I would like to buy a wooden game set.

Print and play board. Stones from [thing=11997] [/thing].

Great connection game. However, I like [thing=4112] [/thing] more due to its simplicity of rules. Anyhow, Havannah has its own flavor and is therefore a nice supplement.

I have played this game by email. It's very deep and subtle, especially on the larger size 10 board. There is a "race" aspect to this game I am still trying to get my head around. It is often very difficult to see who is ahead in the race.

Very different connection game - as one player winning does not block the other, defence is no longer equal to offence, and it sooner or later turns into a race game - who can finish their connection first?

RATING: 6.5
I played the heck out of Dominion, but other deck builders just have not managed to retain my attention. Save for Marvel's hero game - which frankly has far too much to do during set up (a strike out feature for me) and maybe Core Worlds (which I did like), I've been hunting for something better. I think the DC Deck Builder system is what I want. Set up time is a breeze and play is fast - with the notable exception of a few cards such as Firestorm and a few deck diving cards. I really wish those were removed as they just slow down play too much. Why do designers fall back on deck diving cards? Please stop! But other than that - love the theme (villains are very fun to play) and over all design. But not something to put into my collection due to the handful of faulty cards.

RATING: 5
Probably my least favorite of the big box editions. For whatever reason, this version can take just a little too long to play and the first hero you defeat, flash, is unbalanced and gives the first player to defeat him a significant advantage that tends to give them a runaway lead. It happened several times so we know it isn't a flook.

Kind of boring. We are used to Legendary: A Marvel Deckbuilding Game and we expected a similar game, but the mechanics seem clunky and lots of rules that aren't explained well in the included instructions
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.6
Delivers on exactly what it promises: allowing you to play the 'inverse' of the DC Deckbuilder with villains. The more I get into this design, the more I love it, will have to see how the Crisis Expansions blend in with these base sets. Lots of destroying your cards here, which is very thematic. Curious if they'll further this line along with the hero line.

RATING: 1
As much as I love Forever Evil, so much do I hate playing with Bane. In a 2 player game with Bane versus Lex Luthor for example, it's really terrible to be Bane and the game suddenly seems to suffer from a runaway leader problem; Lex Luthor often gets an extra card, being just enough to attack a superhero. The superheroes make him even stronger, etc. That's not how the game should be meant to be.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A great set to add as an expansion to the base game, though it works fantastic on its own as well. The two together are greater than the sum of their parts because, much like Legendary Marvel, it equips you with a toolbox for imaginative scenarios featuring both sides of the DC universe. This set offers a good bit of mechanical variety relative to the original, differentiating itself sufficiently to justify its purchase for long-time players of the DC Comics Deck-Building Game.

Best with two players. At higher player counts, the game really slows down. Very fast with two players. Luck is a little more prevalent than in most deck builders, but it doesn't detract too much from the fun.

Having multiple core sets I think helps this game a lot and adds good variability. Core boxes should probably be played separate though as different mechanics tend to synergize better within sets.

Amazing way to pass your time! Have 4 hours of free time? Enjoy this time you have been given to play this game with friends and family. Some rules are quite hard to understand but you get the hang of it.

***Important point: There are 106 main deck cards. NOT 111 as mentioned in the rule book. (Flipped my whole home upside down, thinking I had lost 5 cards! Haha)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Definitely takes on the tone of the comic mini-series event which brought forth the Crime Syndicate and thrust Lex Luthor and Co. into the spotlight as our world's only hope.  This one relies a lot more on destroying cards (and therefore has introduced Victory Point tokens as a way of making up for all the destroying you'll do), so it doesn't mesh extremely well with the first two Crisis expansions, but it will do in a pinch.

This is a more PvP version of DC Deckbuilder that has more attack cards and more "destroy" this card type options than other versions of the game.  Of all of the superhero/villain deckbuilders out there this is my favorite because it is 1) super quick to setup, 2)get to play the villains, 3)doesn't take as long as other deckbuilders.

While I thought the Heroes Unite stand-alone expansion was a welcome and refreshing addition to this deck building game, I found this one to be unnecessary and unappealing.  The key mechanism of this game is destroying cards, but when every card destroys cards, what are you left with?  Also, there were a few cards that activated punches in different ways, but of course those are among the first cards you destroy, so the whole thing plays poorly.  It left a huge lull in the middle of the game where everyone had bought plenty of cards, but nobody could beat any of the super heroes.  I also found playing the villains wasn't nearly differentiated enough from the previous games where you play the heroes -- I at least expected this to have a lot more attacking, being that these are all villains.

Played once with 3 people at At Ease Games. I enjoyed playing the game, but found it rather long for what it is. We didn't really end up using the victory point tokens at all, meaning all our points came from cards. I am not sure if this was because of how we played, or the characters we used or what. I enjoyed it but don't think there is anything new it in that would make me want to play it over Dominion. Would rather play multiple games of Dominion in the time it takes to play this

The worst of the DC Deck Builders so far. Played with five players and only two of them were able to put together decks that could do anything. Not enough higher power cards in the mix to allow anyone else to be competitive. 

The result was a long game with the majority of the players being slightly bored.

It might play better with a lower player count, but with the other core sets providing a better mix of cards, I can't see giving it another try unless someone else asks to.

I feel like this is probably the most difficult out of the series simply because it breaks the normal play style that they ingrain in you.

Bonus super villain in the first edition of Forever Evil, the ability allows you to get more power for a turn if you destroy a card of decent value.

RATING: 6.5
Same game as the other base sets, but the catch this time is that you get to play supervillains trying to defeat superheroes -- because the comic story had the villains saving the world in the heroes' absence.

Looking for a game that's way too long for what it is? You've found it!

I somewhat like the first DC Deckbuilding Game, and I love the re theming of this, where you play "the bad guys". We played a four player game of this and at 90 minutes we had defeated 3 of the 8 super heroes. At this point all 4 of us were tired of playing and we called it quits.

And it sure seems to me that a card that defends against an attack should at least say, "Discard this card to defend against an attack [b]and draw a card to replace it[/b]".

And I think they put "Forever" Evil in the title because it takes forever to play. (Snarky comment shamelessly plagiarized from [username=kusinohki]

RATING: 6
Somehow this set managed to be all about destroying cards, but still feels way too slow-paced. It also suffers from the Two Towers deck builder syndrome, where the cards aren't powerful enough, so you'll probably run out of them before all the bosses are defeated. On its own, I'd rate this game a 5, but when combined with one or both of the other DC sets, it gets a 6. There are way too many cards that destroy other cards in this set, but they're much more useful when diluted by the earlier sets. More than anything else, the playable villains are a good addition.

There are some new mechanics, like freezing and victory point tokens, but I don't feel they are game changers.

This variant is awesome, highly competitive in my house. I have coupled this with the crisis expansion, it makes the game insane. You have to play completely different than the original version to win. This version you have to destroy cards on a regular basis, which goes against the deck building you learn from the first one.

Highly recommend this for an alternative to the "good guys". Who doesn't like playing the villain from time to time.

Ok deck builder, but it seemed repetitious, determine your power points power points use some powers to draw cards, buy what you can rinse and repeat.

It doesn't break the mold, and I would've hoped the character powers would have seen more balancing after the wide range in the base set was such an issue, but still, if you're looking to play DC Deckbuilder as the bad guys, I guess you've got exactly what you want.

Forever Evil is my favorite base set out of this, the original set, and heroes unite.  I say this because I really enjoy the style of vs. play that it provides. There is a lot of destroying cards and strategic moves to get victory tokens.  A lot of people don't like the token "gimmick" so if you are someone who isn't into extra stuff like that then just don't play it! I personally love the art work on these cards and the characters in it.  Also, the incentives you get for taking down the superheroes are pretty sweet.  My only complaint is that there are a couple villains that I would deem unfair compared to the others (particularly Sinestro).  He makes it easy to rack up victory tokens at times. Also, there are some cards that are designed to destroy other cards that seem pretty pointless. Overall, this is my favorite set for vs. that DC has come out with and it is well worth it!

Variant if you own the base and forever evil. One team is villains and one is heroes. When you buy cards, you can buy both but you essentially buy your group to add them to your deck and the opposing teams cards to remove them from the game.

First play of this went pretty well, leading me to believe that there is some good times to be had here.

I'll echo another comment that I read that said early power curve here is much lower than other DC games so far.  Seems to lend itself to a slightly longer, more combo-ish type of game in the early rounds vs just "8 power, bam".

Artwork is excellent, and it is great to see the cast of Forever Evil in the box.

It feels REALLY weird that the villains of FE are the regular DC super heroes.  The FE storyline has the Injustice League as the bad guys, so I'm not really sure why the heck you're attacking the regular supes.  An objective deck of Ultraman, Super Woman, Power Ring, etc, would have been totally awesome, and it would have naturally lent itself to using Heroes from the other games as characters in a team up.

Regardless, I like the Villains quite a bit, and the VP chips are a welcome mechanic.  I think combination of deck potential is really low here, especially as the villains need some of the VP point mechanics in order to be effective.

Huh, ez nagyon kemÃ©ny volt. Teljesen mÃ¡s, mint az elÅ‘zÅ‘ek. Nem annyira pÃ¶rgÅ‘s, talÃ¡n emiatt sokaknak nem is lesz annyira szÃ³rakoztatÃ³, de mindenfÃ©lekÃ©ppen jÃ³ darabja a sorozatnak, az biztos, h az Ã¡ltalam prÃ³bÃ¡lt DC-k kÃ¶zÃ¼l ebben kell talÃ¡n a legjobban Ã©sznÃ©l lenni.

RATING: 1
Pasted on theme.   Unbalanced to the point that it's essentially broken.  Feels like the designer cared only about the miniatures  (which are cool looking) but couldn't figure out how to streamline the play of the game so he tacked on negotiation as a mechanic.  So glad I didn't back this game.  Looks like it tanks at the retail level too as that version is incomplete.  I've played a lot of games, many of which have left much to be desired.  However I've never been inspired to rate s game before this one.  Which makes this rating of a "1" that much more significant to me.  Ugh.  Tonight's game night was saved by the good company which is great because this game was absolutely awful.

Beautiful area control game with Japanese theme. All game mechanisms are elegantly intertwined 
which makes the game tense and complex in an interesting way, but also a bit hard to grasp on the first sight. 
The loosely alliances are fun to play, especially because certain players teaming up the whole game is not 
a dominant strategy like it often happens in other games (e.g., Game of Thrones TBG). 
The fighting-system is not very thematic but genius: each player has a hidden screen and bids on different effects,
 but all resources are open information so that there is no "memory element" in the game. 
Moreover, the loser of a fight gets all the money from the winner. 
Above all, there is the honor-system that allows different strategies.

Based on first play, with 6 players (KS with almost all the trimmings). Thirty minutes in, there was a clear frontrunner. The next four hours did not change that. Final point scores were 97, 54, 30, and 3 in the 20's.

Too many moving parts, and balance felt fragile rather than tight.  There are definitely opportunities for clever play, but there are a ton of noob traps that punish inexperienced players.  Also, taking godzilla hostage is silly.

Firstly, I haven't played Blood rage, so I'm not able to say which one is the best. Secondly, for the moment I played it three times (5 players, 3 players, 4 players) with casual gamers and hardcore gamers where they really enjoy the game. Thirdly, I think it’s not sufficient to put an exact rating after only 3 plays (I will surely come back to adjust the rating) but to be honest, I will probably not go under 8 of rating (I put 9 for the moment) because: 
- It is the type of the game that I really like: area control, diplomacy, bribery, no dice, action selection, asymmetrical power of the clans, make war :D
- All that I cited works very well (Wow, a cleaver combats systems), with a huge replayability.
- Really good and nice components, especially for all the stuff that you can grab with KS.

To be fair, for the moment what I don’t like in the game, it is the downtime to bring it on the table and to store it in the boxes after the end of the game :/

The diplomacy aspect removes the ceiling on play time, making me much less likely to negotiate with players, but there's a lot of game without that, as well. Nevertheless, early players will encounter balance issues and take a long time making their decisions. Climbing the learning curve will iron out people's analysis paralysis and give them the knowledge to counter the most effective strategies.

Seems like a fact that the Fox clan is the easiest for and against new players. Keep them from getting Righteousness at all costs.

After a great deal of hype and anticipation this game failed to deliver for our group. There is a very disconnected feel throughout with the imbalance of powers evident leading to (in effect) player isolation on the score track. If you’re looking for the control reward element and clan development then stick with blood rage. If you’re looking for a better use of the battle system in a more polished format then go for cry havoc. I’m certain this game will still generate a good buzz but all five in our group were left markedly underwhelmed.

Tentative rating: I'm starting to see that a lot of Eric Lang games are softer experiences than the theme would let you believe. Yes, there's negotiation and interaction here: but it's all in the little details. It's fuzzier and much less straightforward than Blood Rage, but you're constantly talking and when you're finished you keep realizing all those subtle tactics that you missed. A counterpoint to this: the negotiation/diplomacy aspect is not confrontational or explosive enough to justify the minis/visuals.

Eric Lang has managed to design just another unique and intelligent game after Blood Rage. In Blood Rage it is possible that a card you chose is never used, an upgrade you decided to have never produces any effect because the gameplay develops in a different way. Here in Rising Sun every little thing you do does have its consequences, everything makes sense; the whole structure of your gameplay is so tight, and can yet be so versatile, that you have a very intense experience. Time flies. 
The one thing this entirely different game has in common with Blood Rage is that there are so many different and creative ways of winning, that very time your game experience will be fresh and exciting.
The rules are complex, at the same time they are fairly easy to grasp.
The artwork is truly beautiful, and just looking at the game and its components is rewarding in itself.
If you like stretegic competitive games, traitor and bidding systems etc., this is for you.

Played for the first time this weekend.  Only 3 player.  I like it better than Blood Rage - it feels more streamlined.  I thought the ruleset was very straightforward but, after playing, I realize there's a ton of depth here.  Rising Sun isn't the type of game that's necessarily in my wheelhouse, but it'll get a lot of playing time for sure.  Excellent.  Rating may go up from here depending on how play goes at higher player counts.

Samurai Swords+Blood Rage+Twilight Imperium-All weekend time requirement-Rules overhead = 

RISING SUN

Wow! This game is fun.
I have played 4 rounds (×3 Bonsai, x1 Lotus)
Tons of things to try.
Asmy metrical clan powers that all seem awesome.
The political mandate selection is superbly integrated into this game (and the KS version  are chunky like an oversized domino).  Player turns are quick all player get to take the manfates basic action and the active player (and alliance partner) receive an additional bonus action. As a result, you are always engaged in decision making even when it is not your turn.
Area control for Kami bonuses/powers.
Training cards are like an ever-evolving  tech-tree and the synergistic benefits between them, clan power, and the proper mandate card chosen at the appropriate time can be game changing.
The battle system is a bidding mini game unto itself and although bribes are not legal during this phase of the game, you can negotiate the outcome of the battle or bluff and back stab what you just negotiated or simply overwhelm your opponents with hired ronin, monsters or with your amassed treasury.  Beware, however that all winning bids go to the losing clan as war reparations.
Oh, and the minis are ok too.
Rising Sun is able to provide players with an immersive game experience that is based on euro mechnics, with fuedal japanese minis, that continuosly offers up thinky, fun decisions at every turn in 2 hrs and under.

Domo Arigatu, Mr. Lang.

Based on 1 play with a lot of rules learning, but even still I can see this going up with more plays.  LOVE the follow mechanic with the mandates  Lots of things to consider with drafting, upgrading clans, kami worship, area control, bidding and it all meshes really smoothly.  The diplomacy aspect had me worried, but only serves to support the already great player interaction, and it’s not a game breaker to be the one guy not in an alliance.  Lots of replayability in the kickstarter set.  Blood Rage is top 5 for me, but this might overtake it with more plays.  Really a winner.

I am really impressed with Rising Sun. The base game is outstanding, but when you throw in the KS exclusives and expansions, you have a game that really has a lot of re-playability. There seems to be several paths to victory. The asymmetrical clan powers are very cool and interesting. I was worried about the level of negotiations, but so far, I haven't seen that part of the gameplay really make a huge impact. This definitely takes repeated plays to grasp some of the strategies. Finally, if you do acquire the KS exclusives, then the board presence is off the charts. I'm interested to hear of any two player variant rules, though I realize that defeats the purpose of the negotiation aspects of the game.

TL: DR - If you like blood rage at all, and are at least okay with negotiation, you absolutely MUST play this.

Rising Sun, dubbed the spiritual successor to Blood Rage, is a game of alliances, combat, and sudden but inevitable betrayal! 

Turns are taken in this manner: pick an action tile (called mandates) and everyone gets to do its effect, but you (and your ally if you have one) get to do a bonus stronger effect. However, one mandate allows your ally to betray you and break your alliance, while replacing figures on the board with their own. 

Combat is incredibly interesting. You secretly bid your coins to win specific objectives on your personal war tile, and then they occur in order and include options like taking a hostage and committing honorable seppuku. You can even win the last one (War poets) and gain a point for ALL figures that died in that battle, even if your presence was minuscule. You can get a good amount of points without winning the battle, and the kicker is that while you lose any coins you bid, the winner of the battle gives the coins they bid to the other participants. So you can choose to throw a battle and simply gain coins for your next battle to gain better standing.

Each player has an ability that if you didn't know the others, would seem overpowered. The dragonfly clan can summon troops anywhere and move anywhere freely, the turtle clan have their strongholds on the backs of giant turtles, which can move like their figures and count as indestructible troops, the lotus clan can pick a mandate to play face down ad declare any mandate they want!

Last but not least is production, which even without the kickstarter goodies is still excellent. It hurts to say it, but the miniatures are even better than blood rage. The sculpts are amazingly detailed and occasionally monstrous but without feeling fragile. Everything is begging to be painted, and that's a lot of stuff to paint. Honestly my only hangup on the game right now is setup and takedown due to all the miniatures and the CMON typical plastic positions they go in. You'd honestly need to label their spots to easily remember where everything goes, but I'll have a better solution for that as soon as humanly possible.

Honestly, Blood Rage is my favorite game, but it may only take one more play of this to supplant BR. It's that interesting, thematic and fun. AND it does all of this without overwhelming you with options. Play it please!

Only two plays in so far, so this is a tentative score. Having said that, Rising Sun is everything I'd hoped it to be. Many strategic (and rules) mistakes were made first time, but nevertheless I thoroughly enjoyed that initial play-through. The second game played out much differently and I loved it just as much. This is the dudes-on-a-map game I've been looking for this whole time. Excellent.

Rising Sun eliminates most less-than perfect mechanisms within Blood Rage, replacing them with the best mechanics of any game in my collection. There are strong elements of planning, area control, negotiation, and bluffing. If bad things happen in a round, you've been betrayed, out-maneuvered, or manipulated.

We go:
Everybody performs the action selected by the choosing player (Race for the Galaxy, Puerto Rico, ect). This has been keeping everybody engaged and vying for competitive advantage. The honor system, asymmetries, and alliances can make these decisions complex.

Kingmaker:
My only issue with the game is that losing players could likely influence who comes out #1 and #2. This is somewhat offset by the fact that it is likely that the losing players have an ax to grind with #1 or #2.

First play took longer than I’d like.  There’s some AP to be had.  Still, I want to play again to explore the strategies and variety. Have to figure out how to setup/breakdown faster.  

Edit 2/21/18:  getting better with more plays.  The negotiation has gone from random ("I guess I'll ally with you") to much more strategic ("I'm going for x strategy so I'll need y as an ally").  A lot going on and needing to pay attention to what everyone else is doing.

Wow. I'm stunned. I haven't liked any of this designer's other titles.
I only kickstarted it because of the theme.
Pleasantly surprised, in terms of the strategy of game play. 
This is Eric Lang's best work to date. 
Way surpasses Blood Rage, which was just “okay”. 
This really does not have the Diplomacy heritage that it purports to have. There is minimal negotiation here. There is a hint of Blood Rage heritage, in that you can gain VPs both by winning and losing battles.

This is NOT Ameritrash (just the plastic minis are that element). This is a full-on strategy game. Battle resolution is completely deterministic; no dice or card play, but  through board presence and simultaneous money bidding. 

My only small concern after only one play, is the swinginess of the honour track, thought it didn't affect my enjoyment of my first play.

WAY-OVER-THE-TOP produced. But the bits are phenomenal.
This normally rates an 8. But +1 for theme , and for the spectacular components.
But another -0.5 adjustment for the unnecessary gore, decapitated heads, and dangling body parts. It’s a turn off for those playing with kids or family members who don’t want to see that.

Blood rage was probably my favorite game, that is until I played Rising Sun.  This game is amazing.  The combat system is the best I've ever played.  Use coins behind a screen to determine which actions to take.  If you lose, you get coins from the winner, setting yourself up for future combat in the round.  You know the order that each province will be fought, so you have to use your limited actions in the season to set yourself up for the round.  You have to be adaptive though, because the territories will be hotly contested, and sometimes killing your own troops will be the best course of action.   The miniatures are fantastic of course.

I had a blast playing this game. A lot of little wheels all interconnected.

Plus, it looks great on the table too - very nice production values.

Game from famed designer Eric Lang that blends negociation, blind bidding, and area control in a neat Japanese theme. The game looks great on the table as if often the case with CMON releases and it contains some interesting mechanisms -- I especially liked the mechanism in which the winner must give the money he/she spent to the loser or distribute it amongst the loseres if more than one. Ultimately, I'm just not fond of negociation and area control games with conflict so it just wasn't a game for me. While I may only play it if I'm in the right mood, it's sure to be popular for Lang fans.

*7* (Initial plays)
I can certainly see why some will really like this. I do like it but I am not a huge fan of dudes on a map to begin with. The Puerto Rico action selection mechanic works well in this, it's probably my favorite part. I like that the combat is quick without too many fiddly phases. The game length runs longer than I would like for a game like this. Of course, with more plays it could shorten, but could also lengthen by all the negotiation. The kickstarter components are amazing, probably best figures I've seen.

Rated 9 after one play.

I need to take my initial rating with a grain of salt. First, there's the anticipation of the kickstarter arriving, which predisposes me to wanting to like this game :) But also the style of Rising Sun is right in my wheelhouse. Negotiation, dudes on a map, Euro influence... that hybrid style of design will always get my attention.

So what does RIsing Sun do that separates it from other dudes on a map options? For me, there's three standout aspects: 1) the Puerto Rico style of action selection, 2) the combat system and 3) the tech tableau of cards. All of those things blend together very well.

Our first game took 3.5 hours with explanation. That's too long, and I suspect other groups would play faster. I'm not sure if a negotiation style game like this will stick with my typical game group, but it deserves the effort. This probably fires Kemet, which in comparison now feels to sterile and nondescript.

RATING: 9
Super simple rules for a game with this much depth.  The more players the better.  Still haven't wrapped my brain around the right way to negotiate.  Set up and tear down is a beast.  Take pictures of the plastic mini holders before you remove the minis as a guide for where they go back or you will have a not so fun mini puzzle game as you try every piece in every spot.   Desperately needs a better storage solution.  Consolidatign as best as i can with my KS version the game still takes up almost my entire game bag. (the game canopy) 

This game is a table hog.  needs a full dining room size table to play on.  To give you an idea; the board is 6x the size of the box.  You also need room for all the minis and player boards around that.  

Like Terra Mystica each faction has distinctive strengths and weaknesses and why i bring up TM is that it is not going to be obvious to a first timer what that clan needs to do to win.  The special ability of each clan seems like its easy to tell what you need to do but that can be deceiving.  

Lots of variability between each game.  there are core cards that will always be available each season but add on to that a random selection of ad-on monsters all with thier own unique abilities and I think about 6 sets of different season cards that can be mixed and matched for different experiences each game.  Also the Kami can change between games and the order of battle each season will be variable.

This game isn't just a pretty face. The tactical choices are tough - tough enough that they can lead to serious analysis paralysis at times. That's the downside. The upside is that the game is surprisingly easy to teach and even more surprisingly quick to play. Furthermore, your strategies will change wildly each game depending on your clan (which each have different powers that feel highly significant) and the random cards and province tiles you draw.

Two slight dings here, both mostly relevant to 3-player games. First, with an odd number of players, somebody is always going to be left out of an alliance. Not that that's a deal-breaker, but it does open the door to ganging up on one player. Second, especially with 3 players, it's possible that the province tile draw on the last turn will mostly turn up tiles that you already have, thwarting set collection and, quite possibly, any hopes of catching up.

Still, this is an eye-catcher of a game that plays smart and relatively quick even at higher player counts. A winner.

ETA April 2018 - I get that Koreans and Chinese are offended by Japan's military flag.  But this is not a flag.  Japan has been known as "The Land of the Rising Sun" for hundreds of years and is the loose translation of Nippon, the name of the country in the Japanese language.  This is a game, named after the country itself.

Why make a game with combat that doesn't feel like combat? Blood Rage had the irritating Loki cards where you would charge into combat only to find your opponent wanting to lose. Not much fun. Rising Sun is worse...it's not too difficult to figure out who is going to win any individual combat, so the loser will more often than not commit seppuku, write a poem, and come out of the combat far better than the winner did. We had one combat where all three people tried to commit seppuku. Stupid, not fun. Plus it seems odd that the best strategy for those actually trying to win combats is to win a fight and move to another place and win a combat and then keep going...no reason to defend an area of the board, no home spaces. Once you have won a combat in an area you have no reason to defend it. The game just doesn't seem like a war game at all.  And if you aren't going to have big exciting battles why have all those cool monsters?

As usual in one of Lang's games there is no long-term strategy, just try to get points however you can this turn. Again, no feeling of warfare. Pretty game, though. I'm not a big fan of Blood Rage, but it's better than this and at least sort of feels like a Viking game. This feels nothing like feudal Japanese warfare should feel.

If you don't have an alliance - you're screwed.  The only thing you can do is betray and this just gets you figures on the board.  The clans are mismatched.  Some have powers that are useless, others are overpowered.  The honor track can totally f-over your game.  Not likely going to play this again.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A spiritual successor to blood rage, but not really that similar. I think the greatest praise I can give this game is that even though alliance and negotiation are hardcoded into the design, you can actually play the game without these features and have it stand on two feet, the design is that good. Repeat plays will show how well it  fares though I am thinking that it's as good as blood rage, though perhaps slightly less accessible; though no one part of the design is complicated, it's just got two very different sections: the war phase and the mandates; I like the combat, which is solid and quite akin to Cry Havoc (ahem, very akin!), but I think the mandates more interesting and take obvious lineage from Puerto Rico, no complaints there. Clan special powers are fun and the components are top notch. In fact, the best kickstarter exclusives aren't 'minis' per se, but the strongholds, the flags and the unnecessarily gorgeous melamine (?) mandate tiles. I can understand the decision to not ship at retail with 6 clans, to keep cost and box size down, the shelves are groaning under the colossal bulk anyway. And you can get another clan through the dynasty expansion.  However, you could play this game with cubes without losing much, in fact I for one would prefer it and would have liked to have seen a slimmed down version that was entirely focused on the game and marketed at a lower price, you could have kept the monsters as minis or not, stickered discs would have worked. Speaking of the monsters, though the sculpts are amazing: they so big that the game looks insane on the table. They could be half sized and still dwarf the other minis. They make the board look busy when readability is essential. That's a small nitpick really, the overall package is excellent. Guess we'll be getting the Greek Mythological game sometime in late 2019.

Very fun game! This was my first backed KS, and I am very impressed with the quality and detail of the components. My group plays sporadically, but this is one of the first games we have talked about needing to get together soon to play again.  We have some concerns about asymmetry and balance, but through half a dozen playthroughs, we have had wildly different results and have not been able to peg anything as too strong. The Dynasty invasion expansion is only so-so, as those clans are much less compelling.

Another winner form Eric M. Lang.  This very much feels like a sequel to Blood Rage - albeit with a completely different theme.  It's also a little heavier with obvious inspiration from Puerto Rico (the political phase).  The battles felt more devastating and emotional in this game - which is in part of the ingenious simultaneous action selection and bidding in the war phase.  It's worth noting that Rising Sun does have a steep learning curve for new players and is tougher to just jump into and figure out compared to Blood Rage (or the very good The Godfather: Corleone's Empire that came out last year).  But fans of the designer will be pleased.

Es ist ein nettes Spiel und mal wieder ein Material Porno
Das Material ist in der KS Version der knaller schlecht hin wie wir es von CMON gewohnt sind.

Aber so richtig gefällt mir das Spiel nicht da es einfach too much ist von den Möglichkeiten und Verbale Diplomatien.

All die sachen zu überblicken bei all den massig möglichkeiten macht es recht chaotisch und unübersichtlich und man hat nie das Gefühl die Kontrolle zu haben.
Der andere Punkt ist das die Absprachen und Diplomatischen beziehungen zu viel Einfluss im Spiel einnehmen.
Wenn man Spiele wie Diplomacy oder Junta mag dann ist das hier auch wohl was für den jenigen.
Für mich ist das einfach nichts da es das noch chaotischer und unplanbarer macht da man hier Ronin und Geld einfach einem Spieler geben kann damit er definitiv bestimmte Kämpfe gewinnt.

In unserem letzten Spiel habe ich keine Siegchancen mehr gehabt und habe somit einem anderen Spieler immer zugearbeitet damit er gewinnt und dadurch hat er auch gewonnen.
Hier ist zu viel Einfluss durch einen Spieler möglich der den Spielsieg für sich aufgibt.

Im Endeffekt ist es ein nettes Spiel aber wie gesagt die Planungssicherheit ist absolut nicht gegeben was mir bei anderen Spielen deutlich besser gefällt.

Daher wirds meine Sammlung direkt wieder verlassen,
Schade, Bei dem schönen Material hätte ich mir ein schöneres Spiel drumrum gewünscht.

Generally speaking, Eric Lang can be trusted for a "Dudes on a Map" game, and Rising Sun doesn't disappoint. He brings his good sense of integrating variety of tried-and-true mechanics into something that feels new, and blends that with interesting asymmetry and creates lots of room for making weighty decisions and trying novel strategies. Rising Sun might not feel wholly innovative like Chaos in the Old World, but it runs on the same train as Blood Rage in terms of design approach, which I think has been working quite well for Mr. Lang. Yes, there are hints of Chaos and Blood Rage, but also Puerto Rico, Scythe, and the 1980s MB classic, Shogun. Lots of "spiritual successor" games can feel like re-hashes but Rising Sun is its own beast. Even if the game isn't breaking new ground, the one-two punch of production team Cool Mini and illustrator Adrian Smith just makes for such an enjoyable experience, where aesthetic is clearly as important as the game mechanics themselves. Fortunately, both receive high marks. The game might have felt a little long for a first-time play, but surely experience groups could get this going at a better pace and 2 hours is possible. So overall, a beautiful-looking game that is a joy to play and another notch in the collective belts of CMon, Eric Lang, and Adrian Smith.

This is a good game that meshes negotiation with a dudes on the map nicely. A lot of this game is misrepresenting the strength of different players at different times to use alliances to your advantage- which is something I really like but is definitely draining. Other games make this a little more interesting - cosmic encounter for more freewheeling, lords of Vegas for pure excitement, or dogs of war for more levels. The best part of the game is bidding on what combat actions you want - one coin can make the difference in a large number of points and consistent smart spending can really add up over time even if you don't win a lot of combats in a particular round (talking about point maxing from hostage, sepuko, and poets options). This also makes it so you're never really out of the game if  you have a bad round of fighting. Unfortunately the exciting combat bidding seems to take up way less of the game than a not so great alliance phase and a lackluster draft/action selection phase. The minis and the market cards in general are pretty samey and boring - while this does a good job of balancing the game, it sucks out variety. Overall, I'd rather play dogs of war for a prompted/tricky area control negotiation game, or blood rage/kemet for a dudes on a map game with cool powers. This is still good, just not going to displace anything for me. Was close to buying but I'll pass.

Better at higher player counts for certain, but overall I dislike Eric Lang's designs and this game is no different. It seems like all he designs these days are swingy area control games where your position on the board can be undermined in the blink of an eye. I prefer games where long-term planning is paramount and in Lang's game's that's non-existent. The production quality is off the charts good and the board is beautiful. I certainly enjoy this one more than Godfather, less than Blood Rage, but regardless, this is not my cup of tea.

My only dislike about this game is that I felt the kami unbound expansion seemed to make the game very unbalanced but with a few small house rule tweaks hopefully we can get it to work. Overall bloody brilliant game. My mates are fuming they didn't back it haha

Good, not great. Sure enough, when a game screams at you on every page how this is totally a negotiation game, really it is, so many deals guys, you wouldn't believe all the deal-making, it often isn't really a negotiation game.
And that's fine. There's enough here to carry the game in spite of that. It made me want to play Blood Rage, though, more than anything.
But man, the production values are top notch. Amazing minis, even if they are skull-heavy and not terribly clan-cohesive.
[EDIT] It's growing on me. Every game, you grapple a little bit more with the ripple effects of small actions, and the game shows more of what it has to offer.

12 weeks out from estimated shipping I contacted CMON about changing my address due to an unexpected move.  I concurrently held three dozen other open Kickstarters.  Out of all of them, CMON was the only one unwilling to change my address, or even provide a method in which I could change my address.

They instructed me to contact the shipping company, when I receive my tracking number, to arrange my package to be held.  All well and good, if a bit inconvenient, if only we could guarantee that the tracking number would be provided prior to delivery, which CMON has a terrible track record of.

This was at the top of my hype list, now it is at the bottom.  Which is great because the chances of me actually receiving the title are pretty slim to none at this point.  If this game hits my shelf, it will be the last CMON game to do so.

Unbalanced game.  If you start low on the honor track, you are TOAST.  You'll have to wait for the war phase to kill your guys to go up in honor and everybody knows that is what you need to do.  A whole season is wasted.  Honor breaks ties and you can't build it up.  AND THEN, if someone goes up on the honor track, you go down.  That is bogus.  The designer knew this game was broken, so he probably said hey let's throw negotiation in there. And then, in a 5-6 player game, you may never get first player so you will never get that extra turn unless you ally but who is going to ally with you if you are last player.

I declared war on USA early in order to capture the oil island groups ( Borneo, Summatra, Celebes, Java). And also sent the 6 main Carriers to engage the American fleet at Hawaii, which sunk a total of 6 Battleships, then sent Yamato task force to take out Luzon. Eventually the British were dispatched and Japan had her empire. I highly recommend this wargame Rising Sun: the best WW2 wargame dealing with the Pacific

Despite my wholehearted despise of CMON cancerous marketing scams I was positively surprised by the game. It's very easy to teach and play which makes it a good gateway game. The factions are unbalanced, with certain factions having a unique ability that can always be utilized and some other factions having abilities that are way too situational. Besides that, the game is fun to play. The monsters are just smoke and mirrors. An after-though, their real purpose was the excuse to create more minis and add easy stretch goals, drive up the kickstarter cost and value. As far as gameplay, they are meaningless, they are not well integrated, they aren't a good strategy to go for and you will be utilizing an extremely small portion of them compared to how many there are available. Some of them are also unnecessarily big for the size of the board.

Another point I have to make is the absolutely not acceptable approach by the game creators to pick random Japanese sounding names from the internet to create the theme of the game without any kind of research which is ultimately racist and disrespectful of a whole culture.

Impression after one play, may change after subsequent plays.

Game was a bit long with 5 players, but may be shorter after repeat plays. However gameplay was very solid with lots of interesting decisions to make. Combat turns into an interesting puzzle in trying to predict what your opponent want to bid on, and then deciding what you should bid on to either win, or lose and get the most points while doing so. Combat rarley felt like there was an obvious solution on what was the best thing to do.

However, some issues with the game were a lengthy rules explanation and a snowball effect where we had one player fall behind and struggle to catch back up. Also, the clan I played as (Lotus) felt weaker with more players,  as there was less options to use their ability.

Overall though very enjoyable. Prehaps not as good as Blood Rage, but still great and there is lots of variation available to keep the game fresh.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
One play only, which we all loved. High expectations (I'm a Blood Rage fanboy) are thankfully meet in a more considered, strategic package with alliances, action selection, purchasable power-ups and a fantastic combat system that uses money in a fantastic way to link all of each round's battles together. You may win one fight by bidding money generously, but if it leaves your coffers empty for the next one you may well come unstuck.

You may have noticed that it looks pretty good, too. Which never hurts.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
To much luck for my taste. In the last game I could not build more than 2 strongholds, there was no way at all.

Beeing in a alliance will in 99% of the time give you grate advantage. Yes, If you is not in a alliance you could use traiter more freely but its not even close to the advantage a alliance will give you, So in a 5 player game at least 1 will not be in a alliance. 

I player that is not in alliance the entire game can however still win but that is only becouse he could get lucky and find for example a  overpowered monster that will turn the entire game.

It feels like they have worked hard to get a good balance but a game that offers so many diffrent abillities where some is REALLY strong there will always be problems.

The scoring cards will be show only in the last season of the game, all you can hope for is that the correct scoring cards for the clan you build shows up.

The game feels like it sells more on hype and over produced components then the core mechanics.

RATING: 8.6
Excellent game but I think the Combo Fujin + Oni of Spites is way too powerful and relatively easy to achieve. This may have to be house ruled or remove one of the two from the game. In a game with 4 or 5 players it can easily give a net +30 points for the player. In particular with new players it may be better to either remove the Oni or the Kami.

Joined this game as a kickstarter backer at first. But then the company behind the game wanted to throw in an expansion to the game upfront. That made me back out. Seems to me like the company just wanted as much money they could get. Whether or not the game is good or not seemed very little important. And after trying On Her Majesty's Service, Im on guard on CMON's productions. Not interested in paying $100 for a overproduced Yatzee game.

I was very quietly confident I would love this game as its the first game I know of that has a system that actually enforces alliances and give it more of am meaning than just an over the table agreement not to mention a lot of mechanics and aspects of a game I love.


Oh how I was right thank god, completely destroyed blood rage, cry havoc, forbidden stars and Kemet for me and I am sure many other games similar. 

Don't get me wrong I would still be talked into a game of those but if I ever had the chance to play any of those or Rising Sun hands down I would run towards Risung Sun and put my Oni on the table! 


I want to play some more but a friend with very similar tastes has played 3 times now with varying player counts and loves it and is now selling 4 games because of it so I cant see my opinion changing either.

This is just a initial thought for the game.  The game is fantastic and the rule set is actually not that hard once you explain them all.  The Puerto Rico mechanism is use here and it is easy to grasp.  The interesting part of this game is the alliance and the war phase.  The way you secretly bet on specific war rewards is how you gain an upper hand and win the game.  Even if you know you are going to lose the battle, you can still gain VP to help you win the game.  One of my top 10 games of all time.

I don't know what cosmic entity was smiling on me when I chose not to back this one... 

Spectacular CMON minis, maybe their best ever which says a lot, Eric Lange as the designer, supposedly a spiritual sequel to Blood Rage and then just to put it over the top they added Godzilla in the kickstarter... it sounds like it was made for me, but somehow I avoided backing it.  Thank goodness.

This game is remarkably uninteresting.  I found it slow, there are long period where you are uninvolved in anything that is happening.  The game took well over 4 hours, the outcome was never in doubt, I knew 2 hours win player X would win by a large margin and I had no chance, 2 hours later that was exactly what happened.  Massively disappointed, but happy I didn't back it.

All expansions are a must to get variety and ensure replayability.

Juego de conquista de territorios, en el que se pueden hacer alianzas, en las batallas hay pujas ocultas y cada clan tiene unas habilidades especiales.

El juego está muy bien, con una calidad de componentes brutal, incluyendo miniaturas impresionantes.

Le pongo 2 aspectos negativos a destacar:
- Depende de la zona donde empieces en el mapa, tendrás más o menos oportunidades (por ejemplo yo empecé en un sitio donde solo podía moverme a 1 terreno adyacente, mientras que otras zonas te permitían mover hasta a 5 terrenos diferentes...). En ese sentido no está nada equilibrado.

Ok. i rate this on how much i enjoyed playing this.
Rising sun is a fairly light area majority game. in which player needs to acquire resources (money and ronin) 
The game can be completely overthrown by a player who doesnt know what he is doing and taking suboptimal actions and even disastrous ones even for himself.
This was the case in our game. which handed the victory to one player..

However strangely enough i am totally fine with it. Since that means war was fought between three equally capable opponents.  
But it will be strange if he decides to fight like that the next time.
In the first round he did below par plays for his partner. In the second round he did disastrous plays for his partner and himself
In the third round he only did plays for his partner.

He scored 14 points...

Other scores were 62,54 and 48.
knowing that the ten extra bonus could have gone to the 48 player imstead of the 62r if it wasnt for his action that had absolutely no effect on him. you know where i am getting at.. He did it without talking even. he made up his mind he was going to help him to victory 

So we had a three lords and a bum fighting in this one,

The clans forces are wonderfully. and it doesnt appear to unbalance the game.
It does take some skill to use your clans forces optimally but it easy enough to gain some advantage of them straight away.

Clean up time was a bit long after the game :-)

Kickstarter Daimyo pledge + playmat + metal coins
Solid 9 game. Components are top notch, even without the metal coins and playmat (though those are seriously awesome too).
Not just a very pretty game, but a fun one too. REquires lots of thought and strategics, and will most certainly get better with each play. 
First game took about 3 hours, but that playtime is hugely reduced once you get to know the game and the rules, especially the season cards.

Rating after one play. Was nice, nothing really new. I just don’t get why they put a lot of efforts in big minis but then design them not in a way that leads to their powers. Design feels just random. Looks nice though.

RATING: 8
Konnte ich bis lang nur einmal spielen und das auch gleich mit volle Besetzung. Ich finde es grafisch top und passend. 
Ich mag die Idee am Anfang einer jeden Jahreszeit um die Allianzen zu schachern, hängt hier aber stark von den Mitspielern ab, ob groß was geht. Ich weiß nicht mehr wer es gesagt hat aber ich finde die Bemerkung passend: Wenn man nicht schnell genug war fühlte man sich wie in der Disko wenn das Licht angeht und man nimmt was überbleibt. Ist mir zum Glück nicht passiert, da ich es geschafft hatte immer gleich vor der eigentliche Phase auch eine Allianz zu finden und hier auch einen gefühlten Minuspunkt im Spiel und zwar der starke Startspieler Vorteil. Ich sehe den Festungsbau direkt an Anfang als sehr stark an und wenn man entsprechend seine Allianzen schmiedet kann man in der 2. Jahreszeit schon alle gebaut haben. Ebenfalls haben die anderen Spieler keine Möglichkeit wenn es doof läuft nach dem 2. Spieler noch Festungen zu bauen. War bei meinen einen Spiel leider so verteilt, kann sich natürlich relativieren wenn die Aktionen anders gemischt werden. Die Auflösung bei Gleichständen finde ich okay, denn in Regelfall sind die Unehrenhaften Aktionen stark um den Ausgleich zu schaffen. Das Kampsystem finde ich gelungen, erinnert natürlich an Cyrisis (?), was ich leider bis heute nicht einmal voll spielen konnte. Was komisch Empfand ist das gefangen nehmen der riesigen Monster, was dessen Besitzer fast dazu zwing sehr viel Geld zu investieren um das zu verhindern, dass diese Überhaupt wirken. Wegen den Blancing der Clans kann ich noch nicht so sehr viel sagen. Natürlich wirken einige Clans stärker als die anderen aber um das vollkommen ab zu schätzen würde ich es gerne nochmal spielen.

Initial impressions: I thought I didn't like negotiation games and this game's spiritual inspiration was supposedly Diplomacy, but that I didn't mind the negotiation here and in Inis makes me think that maybe I just don't like them in party games and when someone uses it to just play really chaotically. Alliances, timely betrayals, and supposed alliances but actually just taking of advantage of alliances definitely seem like they can be powerful in this game, but it isn't like you can go frm sharing a great board state with another player to them next turn wiping you off the map.

This seems to share a lot of similarities with Blood Rage, namely that the mythological themes don't seem to be that well integrated (the fact that one monster is named after a faked wikipedia entry is especially bad here), but the multiple combos and strategies you can employ makes me like both games anyways. In particular, the dimensions you have to consider simultaneously the benefits of having high honor vs. tanking your honor, the area control (through the gods and harvest actions), winning battles at the end vs. getting immediate points from seppuku and battle poets, which regions people want more, and which actions to boost via cards and strongholds. Like Blood Rage there are the mind games of what people are going to play for in battles, even moreso here, and also like Blood Rage losers lose all their units, but winner pays a higher price that makeit easier to win future battles in the same round. Like Blood Rage there is a win by losing strategy which I like, but for people who don't I think it is easier to remove the clans and powers that combo with such a strategy. Like Blood Rage minis are way to overproduced for what they convey and in that actually kind of detract from the theme for me due to the schism, but otherwise the visual design of both games are excellent to help convey information easily. Like Blood Rage I think some cards some people will think are unbalanced either too weak or strong (moreso in Blood Rage), but presumably over time the depth of the game systems will be revealed to show additional combos to boost the "weak" cards and counter the "strong" ones. Like Blood Rage some of the ways to score feel a little arbitrary and not thematically tied. Like Blood Rage if people don't evaluate threats correctly someone can run away with the game.

Some big positives this game has over Blood Rage is that each clan has very unique and powerful abilities right off the bat, the mechanism that is unique to it in the Puerto Rico-like variable phase order is interesting and is more thematic than the unique mechanism of Blood Rage of drafting of cards, and it can play 5 without extra content. Some big negatives compared to Blood Rage is that combats are at the end of each season only drains a lot of the spontaneity that added more tension and excitement throughout each round, and its money economy doesn't feel as smooth, with many periods of famine in between sporadic bursts of income and big swings based on how much people value certain regions during the wars, compared to the hand management and rage action point allowance in Blood Rage.

Completely overwrought eurogame seemingly posing as ameritrash wargame.  There is no war game in the box.  I see little room for interesting negotiation in the game.  Mostly there is a lot of opportunity to get bogged down in attempts at negotiation and the think-counterthink-bluffing-based combat system.  Lots of downtime.  Painfully few opportunities to choose actions (sometimes just once per round).  The similarity of the cards to Blood Rage are frustrating when you realize you will not get many chances to actually purchase and use them.  I'd rather play a 2-player bluffing combat game like Shazamm! than a 2-3 hour game that is largely based on the same mechanic when it comes down to it.  If as much time was spent making meaningful connections between mechanics and theme as was spent on designing the components, this could be a great game.  As it is, it looks better on the shelf.

Strange one. I don't care about minis to make a good game, I don't particularly like Blood Rage, don't care for direct player conflict, and find CMON kickstarter tactics manipulative and bordering on hostile to consumers. 

On top of that the game is also a pain to set up, put away, and carry around (particularly with bonus stuff.)

However this is a really good game! Very compelling action selection mechanism. Interesting decisions and sometimes mind-boggling dynamics between the gods, map play, honor jostling, and the genius war blind bids with war reparations and suicide poetry.

The alliance system is fascinating... with passive aggressive allies trying to minimize each others benefits, and trying to engineer well timed betrayals, fighting each other for gods majorities and easy wins in battle territories. 

Played twice. The recent 3 player game, the non-allied player did the best in each of the three seasons and scores were between five points of each other. In our four player game the turtle clan dominated through some admittedly poor play of other clans.

Looking forward to plumbing the depths with this one and  to getting some of the expansion content on the table. It will take time to learn the balance of player powers and improve our negotiation tactics as we become able to read the game better. 

This really is a well crafted experience game with an epic board presence, which I normally don't care for but may be coming around on.

It sucks that the beautiful plastic mandate tiles are kick-starter only. Favorite component ever and should be generally available. I would still play without though.

I had a lot of fun playing this game for the first time recently. The variety of strategy is excellent; I loved that each clan had a slightly different approach to purchasing cards, building strongholds and moving on the board. The Honor system was really great and a few battles were determined by that alone. 

Production: 10/10. Everyone who played commented on how well everything looked and the figures are excellent. Personally, I also really, really liked how the season cards vary between play sessions of the game. I feel like that creates replay value for me. Additional, I felt like this is a unique area for custom house rules: you can create, combine, and sort through the season cards for super original seasons if you want. (E.G. using all of the monsters in the game or having a season more weighted with War cards). -Of course this is probably a little imbalanced but nonetheless, I feel as if it mixes up the game over time. 

The negotiation aspect went over really well for my group and worked out best for everyone. I was a little skeptical of both the alliance system and negotiation system, but it faired much better in the end.

This game is physically large and does require a big table. It does take a while to setup and tear down, however, it was expected and it's not a big deal to myself.

Lastly, the KS exclusives are really great and it is a shame that they will not be coming to retail. I would prefer if these exclusive figures and alternative play styles come later as expansions. 

Overall, super great game. I enjoy this play style primarily because I loved Blood Rage and this is no different. Lots of strategy, lots of fun putting big dudes on a board.

RATING: 7.8
+ The rule book is fantastic. it's an easy read and explains all the important parts of the game with helpful examples and illustrations. The lay out is near perfect and the inclusion of some of Adrian Smith's amazing art is always welcome. The reference on the back provides just enough information to keep the game moving smoothly.

+ The rules are simple but they offers a lot of strategy. A season consists of a few phases: Players get income, reveal the provinces that will be at war at the end of the season and players will make alliances. Then, the active player chooses a mandate action which allows them to recruit, move, train, harvest or betray while the other players follow the selected action, sometimes with a less effective version. Area control at the temples is checked a few times during the season and offers benefits to the leader of each. The season ends with resolving battle in 5-8 provinces. Do that three times and the game ends. The complexity is in playing with and against the other players, forming alliances, breaking alliances, sowing seeds of discontent in rival alliances, and so on. 

+ The follow mechanism combined with the alliance bonuses is great and offers compelling reasons to create, break, or even avoid an alliance depending on who's the next player, which cards are available, which temples are available, the wars that will be fought at the end of the season, and the current state of the board. It's incredibly important to pay attention to turn order.

+ The area influence at the temples adds an agonizing decision between adding more force to the provinces or getting special benefits from the temples that will help you in other ways.

+ The honor system offers legitimate reasons to be both high and low at different times throughout the game requiring you to make painful sacrifices (maybe a high honor will help win a critical tie at the temple, but it will also mean your Oni contributes much less force to a battle.) With more plays I'll be curious if players will benefit from going all-in one way or the other.

+ The battle system is really interesting and puts you in control. There's no random number generator determining your success or failure. You need to plan your battles carefully taking into consideration how much force, money, and reinforcements your opponents have at their disposal, and what is motivating them. There are several options available to you, but you'll need to win a bid for the action you want to perform to benefit from it. When you win, you'll get the war token and when you lose, you'll receive coins from the winner, giving you more options in subsequent battles. A carefully planned loss can be a great option.

+ The additional content -- temples, season cards, clans, and monsters -- promises to add a lot of variability and replay value.

+/- This game is going to make you really question your ability to be friends with certain people. It enables players to do some really terrible things to each other. Plan accordingly.

- While this is certainly a great rule book, I would love to have a card reference which goes into detail on each card since we encountered some nuances that required a bit of discussion and consideration, but they were ultimately worked out after revealing more cards and comparing them with one another.

This game is amazing.  It takes everything I like about Blood Rage and drops the things that have made that game hard to get to the table by removing the draft.  This makes the game far more approachable and a snap to teach.

There's an elegance here where fairly few rules and mechanics mesh into a very complex and fascinating puzzle.  All of the asymmetrical powers feel amazing, but don't break the game.  Even the clan I was least interested in (turtle) was the one I ended up playing for my first game and I quickly realized how awesome their mobile strongholds are - largely because the game wants you to conquer new territory each season instead of becoming entrenched and movement is at a premium.

The production values are, of course, top notch.  Played with 4 players and core box only.

EDIT: These comments reflect a preview play before release.  After release play I've seen more lopsided games where it makes me think this might take a little more time for everyone to pick up than I first assumed, but the open information does make it less intimidating than Blood Rage.

Grandiose Ausstattung, stimmungsvolles Artwork, fantastische Figuren - nach dem ersten Spiel lässt sich zudem sagen: Tolles Gameplay! Alle Phasen lassen Inteaktion zu! Das Bietersystem beim Kämpfen ist zugegebenermaßen gewöhnungsbedürftig, allerdings hat man hier genauso wie im ganzen Spiel nie das Gefühl etwa gravierend falsch zu machen. Diese Leichtigkeit - ausprobieren, antesten, einfach mal machen - - hat uns alle in der ersten Runde sehr begeistert. Warum auch hier die Zeitangabe mit 90-120 Minuten deutlich im Bereich Märchen anzusiedeln ist (vor allem wenn man das mit den Allianzen ernst nimmt, erschließt sich mir bei diesem Liebhaberstück nicht.

Wow!!! Just WOW!!!

Two plays one with 4 and one with 5 players.  This game WAY surpassed my expectations.  GREAT minis AND game play.  Very cool monsters (Oni) and abilities that can be purchased in game.  Ways to gain and lose honor along with the benefits / consequences of doing so. Probably the best game I've played with "alliances" and "negotiation".  Rules are pretty straightforward, but the amount of manipulation / maneuvering, and room for "smart" and "exciting" play (without dice) is quite impressive.  In my book this will easily be in the BGG top 10.  Asymmetric powers that seem strong, but not overpowered, and game seems quite balanced.

I think the biggest challenge in this game (for me) is how to pick alliances, and negotiate smartly. Regardless, lots of fun!

I was lucky enought to play it to help a friend to write a review. Man, what a game! In Rising Sun, Lang was at his best. Thanks to the different factions, the Kami cards and the seasons cards, every match is enough different from another. The bet combat system is amazing and sometimes it's a good idea to loose, or to kill all your samurai, to win a later battle. Rising Sun has no dice to roll, you can't blame "bad luck". it's a beautiful game that doesn't forgive your mistakes.

Visually this is a beautiful game and the components are top notch.  However, for a game that appears to ooze theme it is not very thematic.  I don't like the combat system.  It's more important to have money than it is to have force.  Oh, you can also take Godzilla hostage with any unit, including the weakest units in the game, WTF!!!!  You can commit Seppuku whenever you want but it only counts for something if you spend the most money!  The game puts so much into theme yet utterly fails to be thematic, I'm pretty disappointed.

Played a 2 hour game with 3 players. The two players who allied early on ran ahead with the extra ally advantages from the mandates. Game degenerated into king making soon after. Rating might change with different player counts, but I'm wary that additional players will just drag the game even longer. 

Game play boils down to BLOOD RAGE's "dudes on a map," mixed in with a PUERTO RICO action/phase selection and a battle system is reminiscent of the bidding/bluffing system of SCYTHE. Messy IMO, but if this sounds like something you're into, RISING SUN is up your alley. 

Production levels of this game are insane. Just don't fall in love with all the bling and miniatures, the strategy in RISING SUN doesn't quite hold up. Combat lacks tension and is more about moves and counter-moves. The honor system trumping every tie in the game makes it easy for runaway leaders. 

I'd play again, but am not in a rush to see it back on the table.

Where are these people with the 1 ratings coming from? Where are you seeing the Japanese WW2 Imperial flag on the game board or box? I would understand the concern if there was an actual Japanese WW2 flag on the box or board.

 The name of the game has everything to do with how Japan is perceived by China, where the sun rises in the east. This game and its theme has NOTHING to do with WW2 Japan. 

For the record, I'm a Chinese American board gamer and I am looking forward to this game.

Smart light war game that doesn’t outlast its welcome and takes place almost entirely above the table - this game is ALL about the diplomacy and strategy/tactics balance.  The game is also obscenely overproduced, the game board is still too busy for its own good, and the errata sheet is already three pages long - typical CMON fare, but in this case it might actually be worth the effort.

4 Plays - If you are completely mechanics driven, this is a 7/10. The game visually spectacular though, which really improves the experience! This is an area control strategy game. Not really a dudes on a map experience, even though that's what it looks like. Not really a big negotiation game, despite the claims (though there is some). Nothing really 'new' mechanically, but overall the game works very well and is simple to teach and learn. There are a lot of cards, which can make determining the 'state of the board' more difficult for newbies. Gets better over multiple plays.

Changed from 9 to 10 due to all the annoying nonsense 1's.  I'm quite impressed with the gameplay and mechanics.  Eric Lang knows game design and does it well.  The battle mechanism reminds me of Meleé, which I quite enjoyed. Guessing the amount bid and winning the coins if you lose is a nice balance... the double crossing, good for me=good for you, bribing, whining, extorting, and wheeling/dealing make this a great game! The minis and art just make one slobber. Lots of good stuff here, deep strategy, long term planning of tactics.  This will be a gem in the collection right next to Blood Rage, Cthulhu Wars, and Scythe! Love it!

One of the best in its genre. Better than Blood Range in my opinion. The game comes in two large boxes and top notch quality components with fantastic plastic monsters.

In Rising Sun, as in all war games of this type - which I call "Risk-like" for lack of a better word - players are susceptible to chaos and unexpected actions by other players, which cannot be planned for. As it's often the case, the player who gets picked on the least tends to win. That said, there is room for lots of good decision making and clever strategical and tactical plays.

Like Blood Rage and the like, the game can cause friction among players. So watch for temperamental players. But overall it is a fun experience to be had once in a while as long as it's not taken too seriously.

I think this game is great. It may not be the most newbie-friendly, but the disadvantage to playing with more experienced players is minimal. It's quick to learn, and learning is more compartmentalized, especially when the game is split into three identical seasons.
There isnt a lot of down time either since everyone completes each mandate. 
I was skeptical that the bargaining wouldn't be accessible, but everyone seemed to really see the value in it as it was used quite a bit. 
Your decisions hold lots of consequences Which makes this game very good for both casual players and more competitive players. Casual players can try things and see how they work out, and competitive players can really think out their strategy. 
There is enough variation to make each game feel special, not like a puzzle to be solved.

Anyway I like the game.

Not a fan of dudes-on-a-map (DOAM) games.

This one, at least, ends in a set number of turns.

OMFG the Kickstarter version is so over-produced!

The alliance mechanism is very amusing!

The Puerto-Rico-Citadelles mechanism of choosing roles adds a lot of downtime, though. As with Citadelles, you can't see what roles a player can pick from, so all you could do is wait. At least the alliance mechanism alleviates this a bit as you could negotiate a bit about what role to pick.

Still, I think the alliance mechanic is there more to make the game less violent and more balanced rather than to add a negotiation element.

Rising Sun is like a wedding cake:  massive, beautiful, and hedonistically excessive in delightful and obnoxious ways...   And like a wedding cake Rising Sun leaves an excellent first impression,  but once the giddy Ameritrash sugar high wears off, you're left with just another extremely fiddly above-average area control game that substitutes flash for substance.
Rising Sun is far from bad, but there's nothing here other games haven't done better or more elegantly.  I'll happily play again, but it simply can't compete with deeper and more focused games like Shogun or Imperial.

It also bothers me to no end that the game is clearly designed around having 6 players present to reach full potential, but the sixth faction is Kickstarter or Expansion exclusive.  This is the board-game equivalent of shipping an incomplete game so you can sell day-one DLC.  Absolutely abhorrent behavior from CMON.

Great game. Everything is gorgeous in the Kickstarter version. Tons of variable setup, tons of factions, and very streamlined mechanics with some real meaty tactical decisions. this one strikes the perfect balance of not to complicated but tons of room to grow as far as becoming more proficient. I have nothing but good things to say about this one. All I can say is it does not dethrone my #1, Blood Rage. But it came fairly close to maybe tying.

RATING: 7.5
A very hesitant 7.5 rank - could go slightly up, but is likely to drop considerably. 
While I like the action selection, the artwork and the physicality of the components, the game has quite a few problems. 

First of all, the game out stays its welcome - each game has been +2 hours, which is at least 45 minutes too long for what the game offers. 

While the presence of minis definitely add to the coolness of the game, there’s just too much of everything. The game drags out because of the gazillion pieces and during each round we constantly had to go ‘this dude does what again?’ and ‘oh, I forgot you had that thing’ etc. On top of that, the Kami figures and to some extent, the monsters, look just a little too much alike making it hard to differentiate between them at times. 

The blind bidding battling also is perhaps the biggest problem - and where I might be wrong. But it often feels like Rising Sun gives the illusion of important meaningful decisions, whereas in reality there is only very little to you can do to alter potential outcomes. Yet, because of the blind nature of the battle preparation, you feel like you have a chance at doing anything you want, yet were the preparation to be done openly, I suspect it would become obvious how little impact is actually possible.

Only played with 4 - I think it probably shines at 5. A fun, pretty fast playing area control game. The Puerto Rico-style action selection is really fun, and vying for temple bonuses is a nice addition, with variable temples and order each game. The Oni seem over the top in miniature size and I’m not sure how much they add. I would have preferred more variety in Train cards. Alliances and bonuses for you and your ally for the action you select is a nice bonus while not overpowering (not as interesting as the alliance bidding in Struggle of Empires of course, but it’s fine), but I do feel the Harvest bonus is a bit over the top. I think it would be better if the alliance that selects the action gets resources for all their areas while the other players get resources for just a single area each controls. I crushed the other players primarily by getting an early lead from the first 2 or 3 harvests that the other players couldn’t catch up from.  The best part of the game is the battles - it’s good that they only occur 3 times, so during the season there’s this buildup and repositioning. The second-guessing what other players will bid on is so tense and mind-bending, and it’s a great way of allowing all players to have units in the battle and have interesting options. There’s no randomness, but the uncertainty what other players will do and purposely being unpredictable can leads to big surprises or upsets where you “win” the battle but I net more points/honor/money/unit available for recruit next season. Being higher in honor is a huge advantage, and I feel the lower-honor Onis is not the ideal way to counterbalance this. I would prefer if there were other abilities you might get from having lower honor, like an extra unit replacement when you betray or you can steal money during Marshall or something else sleazy that low-honor daimyo would do.

RATING: 6
One play with 5 players.

It was a lot of fun, and the minis were amazing. I would love to play it again, especially with fewer players. With 5 players, I sometimes found myself on the sidelines doing nothing for 5 or 10 minutes at a time while battles were resolved that I wasn't a part of.

Negatives:
Setup and takedown. It took about 15 minutes to solve the puzzle of putting everything back into boxes.
Kingmaking/luck - If you want to win, you have to play well, but if you have more than one person playing well, then the winner is largely determined by luck and kingmaking. In our game, no one was intentionally kingmaking, but who they decided to attack / spend their coins on ultimately determined the victor.


After 2nd play with 6 players I lowered my rating from 8 to 6. I would like to try again with 3 or 4 players, but the game took much too long. And being last in playing order was very frustrating. My Bonsai ability was nullified by players choosing the best cards before I could select them, and by denying me the ability to get more cards using Shinto. Also, the first 3 players each had opportunities during the game to choose both the first AND last action! I always had to select one action in the middle, which meant the advantages I could gain could easily be undone by those selecting after me. 

Also, once again, battles took forever because everyone (including me) would have to keep asking, what does that monster do again? How much is he worth now? What if this? What if that?

Loving this game! I have a couple issues with it in terms of "that one controversy", "Man the way that you miss out on so much if you dont KS it" and also "how the heck am I supposed to fit this all in the box?!" but in terms of gameplay, its a pretty solid negotiation game.

This now has the best components to any game I own.  The base game minis are superb, but the kickstarter exclusives add a luxurious feel to the game in a big way.  The game itself is very entertaining, but it does take a playthrough to wrap your head around strategies and how to manipulate battles.  The variability in cards has me excited to play this again to see more monsters, different ways to score points, destroy your enemies and conquer territories!  Negotiation doesn't really have to be all that important to enjoy the game, but it also has potential to be very integral if that's what you want from this game.

Arrived from KS.  Played first two games at Con of the North.  I did okay the first game playing the Koi clan and then got decimated game two with Lotus.  Not having honor cost me dearly.  I like the game a lot and hope to explore all the different clans, cards and strategies.  The game looks absolutely amazing on the table and provides constantly changing strategies as your opponents go and possibly betray you. Still not sure of I like it more than Blood Rage, but it's probably the game I want to play the most right now.

From modern elements like Puerto Rico / T.I. style phase selection (with a twist!), fast-playing turns, incentive to not turtle (by allowing you to score each region only once), to hitting all the tropes of the genre like hostages, seasons, harvests and alliances, this game has it all, and makes me hard-pressed to pick another Dudes on a Map game when it comes time to lay waste. Add to that Eric Lang's trademarks of dying for VPs, three upgradeable unit types, 'ruination', a brilliant implementation of seppuku, and the most original and fun combat-resolution system in years, and you get an easy new favorite.

A very fun and engaging Honor based diplomacy dudes on the board game.
Very well balanced, with an absolutely BEAUTIFUL art style, theme, and stunning miniatures.

Very deep and immersive gameplay round out a game I will be happy to play on a frequent basis.

Couple notes,
Much less Cleavage than Blood Rage which is a welcome addition
Much More Severed Heads which is also a welcome addition.
Love the asymmetrical clan design.
Miniatures are much easier to identify because of color than blood Rage
Less of a chance of run away winner than Blood Rage
I feel a better Game than Blood Rage with better Mini's, and a more enjoyable system for the game mechanisms.

Played this with my friends copy - He got all the Kickstarter bonus' and man I loved the mechanics of the battle and turns. A very cool game.. but the miniatures are VERY obnoxious and unnecessary.

I would purchase this game in a heartbeat if the mini's were a) all the same size or b) all cardboard chips.

Played a buddy's fully tricked out Kickstarter copy. Ohmygod. The minis are freaking awesome. TURTLE CASTLES!!! GIANT DRAGONS!!! PLASTIC TILES!!!

Game play? Oh, I think there was game play. 

Seriously, it was fun. 

Basically the game is a combo of action selections, building up powers (both monsters on board and special cards), battles that provide area control, and  variety of ways to score points. A real nifty element is the combat system, which allows you to bid on various ways to modify the battle. Because the bidding is secret, bluffing (or just outthinking) is a big part. The combat bidding allows for some tricky upsets. Also, because battles are fought sequentially, you can fake a guy to spend early, saving your money for the big battle at the end. 

Obviously first impression but first impressions are good. Aesthetically I don't love the board, a little too garish, but it's fine. The minis are fantastic. All game play is smooth and clever (duh, Eric Lang). I immediately liked it more than Blood Rage which never floated my boat. It does escalate the point gathering but not as much as Blood Rage. It also feels like there are more things you can play with to try and score points.  My only critique is with all the special powers, there are a few too many edge cases. Once the errata is ironed out that shouldn't be a big thing.

In my first game, the one experienced player grabbed the Fox Clan and some cards that allowed him to die and score points and he died and scored a LOT of points. It looked like he was running away with things without doing any area control stuff. We nipped him a bit, though, and he ended up only scoring 2nd place. That felt good. He found a good strategy, worked it well, but it didn't destroy the game. 

I wish I could own this but there's no point. My buddy has it and I'm only likely to play this kind of game with him.

Another Eric Lang DOAM game that is far better than Blood Rage...but that is not saying much. 

There are just so many ways to randomly screw other players that I found it almost impossible to put together a cohesive strategy. I just looked for ways to best optimize for the current turn. And given that the core of the game relies on a random action selection draw made it all the more maddening.

The alliances and Puerto Rico-esque advantages seemed like a half baked mechanism. I felt I was forced into them for the sake of making them. I suppose with 3 or 5 it would make for some interesting table talk but with 4 or 6, it falls flat.

The combat was downright unfulfilling. Players know exactly how many units and how much money the other players have. So it came down to guessing and blind bidding. Meh.

There was no negotiation in our game either. None. So if BR: Risk as RS: Diplomacy (which others are saying), I didn't see it. 

Granted, it was my first play and I really didn't know the game but this game did not click for me on many levels. I guess I would give it another go to see if my initial impression could be swayed but I strongly suspect I am right on this one. 

Nice bits but wholly unnecessary. If you take away the minis, you have a partially spliced Wallenstein clone where the randomness is not contained.

Found this game to have a lot of flaws.  Area control without the ability to choose your conflicts is a deal breaker. Destroys agency. 

With all the multiple monsters/oni the game seemed liked an exercise in obfuscating who was going to win any conflict.

Room for both strategy and tactics, but tactics seem to win the game.

Lot of replayability.  Asymmetrical.

Lovely components.

Creative combat resolution.  Haven’t played blood rage, need to compare.

Big pass.

I was on the fence about buying this game because I did not like "Blood Rage" so much, and this was marketed as a successor. But I am glad I backed it. 

"Rising Sun" is fun - I like it much more than "Blood Rage". There are many choices to make and many reversals of fortune, and the alliance mechanic adds a lot of fun.

This Project is very good. But that's a shame.
Because this game use the special Flag. but That plag name is Rising Sun(Ugil flag).
The flag you are using right now is Rising Sun Flag which should not be used. The flag is a symbol associated with Japanese imperialism during 2nd World War and carries a similar meaning as Nazi's Hakenkreuz. Using this flag is disrespecting the countries those were suffered by Japan in those days. Please be refrained from using it. If I use an image of Hakenkreuz when I upload video clips related to Germany it will make you feel very uncomfortable. Please do not use Rising Sun Flag for whatsoever.
Why don't you blame that people use Rising Sun Flag?
Thanks for reading.

It drags on, is kinda boring. Feels somewhat unbalanced. Convoluted game elements and rule exceptions that just needlessly complicate the game. Honour system is rather broken and seems to strongly favour the player who starts at the top, especially with the worshipping aspect. IMO, should allow draws instead of resolving everything with honour. Alternatively, it should be a numerical system instead so that more sacrifices puts you further ahead in honour, as opposed to just one ahead. If a player can gain an early advantage it's difficult for others to catch up. Alliances don't seem to add a lot to the game. Interesting combat mechanics end up being buried by the rigamarole of the political phase. Miniatures are too large and cumbersome for the board, which itself is large and cumbersome. Shrink everything by 20-30% and you'd get a better playing experience.

RATING: 7
First impression was mostly good, but I think I'm just not a big fan of dudes on a map/stab you in the back games.  The components in the kickstarter version I played were incredibly impressive, and the minis were astounding.  The game mechanics are interesting and reasonably restrained for this kind of game.  My choices were often fairly constrained but still interesting, and there were many possible things to negotiate over.  The combat is really interesting.

Also, it's really, really long.  And I don't think that would change much with repeated plays.  I'd expect 3 hours plus rules if there is to be any kind of negotiating.  It's fun, but it isn't the kind of game I'd likely suggest.

Rising Sun is a negotiation-focused area control game. There are three other notable games like that: Diplomacy, Game of Thrones: The Board Game and Rex: Final Days of an Empire (or Dune if you have pillaged a museum/eBay).

What makes Rising Sun stand out from those other games is that all of them are fairly complex and lengthy games(Rex CAN be fast I've heard, but it wasn't the two times I've played it), and more or less need 5-6 to be solid, which makes it tough to get to the table. Rising Sun could therefore be a solid alternative if you want to play a negotiation area control game without making it into the one event-game you invite your friends to play. 

On the Blood Rage angle, I know a lot of people are hyped about it for that reason, but personally I wasn't a fan of Blood Rage. There are certainly similarities between the games, but there some key differences that makes me interested in this without liking Blood Rage.

Highly engaging and full of strategic thinking.  Players need to pay attention to a lot of things happening at once and must try and foresee multiple avenues their competitors/allies may take.  Negotiation can be strong depending how far the players want to take it.  Everyone playing it had a great time and after each season we would inevitably have a 5-10 minute conversation discussing mistakes made to enhance their battle positioning for further battles.  We all had a great time.  I will definitely continue to be playing this for a very long time.

The UX is a nightmare.  The minis are huge and get in the way of reading the game state. And since there is no iconography of any type to indicate what power each Oni actually has, there is a constant conversation of, "Hey wait, what is that guy's name? Oh. What's his power? If you're lower in honor? Are you... hold on a sec... and then how much force is he worth now?" 

The gameplay itself is frustrating. It has that not-so-magical ability to make a 2 hour game feel like a 4-hour game. You can be frozen of the game so easily by faction selection and the fact that your position has nothing to offer anyone. Alliances can form before you've even had a chance to figure out what has happened, and you can be isolated out into irrelevance very quickly. 

This game is not fun.

Although the designer claims that the inspiration for Rising Sun is Diplomacy, the deal-making and backstabbing take a huge back seat to a thorough area-control game.  The varying mandates of each productive month culminate in an incongruous series of AUCTIONS to resolve winter's battles.  (Huh?)  However... Rising Sun is wildly overproduced.  The enormous minis, especially in the final round, block visibility of the board and are a hassle to pack up.  Nice game, wouldn't want to own it.

Great game. The honor system is interesting but really needs more ways to lose honor than simply betrayal. 
It does play a lot on alliances and agreements and that can go badly with certain groups or individuals. Hell it can go good to bad in a turn if the betrayal is very impactful. 
Most of the time the betrayal is agreed and planned based on needing to be on a certain position on the honor track for an upcoming battle. Nothing like nerfing that 4 point bonus for an oni that an opponent is counting on by a well times betrayal.

Needs repeat plays to understand the use of some clan abilities and what cards play best to those.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Incredibly fun game that was easy to teach and play for my friends that are usually not into anything more heavy than Risk. I think the combination of the many various 'shallow' complex mechanics make for a greatly strategic and tactical game, while at the same time not bogging itself down too much with any single mechanic. The card drafting, for example, is simple enough to understand and doesn't bog the player down with too many additional parameters to keep track of. The monsters and kami are more often than not straight to the point in what they're supposed to do.

All in all, for my gaming group, the perfect choice for an area control game that satisfies the 'need' of both our more casual board gaming friends as well as our more seasoned veterans. Just excellent.

1st impressions: Really good. Very much a war game, but with the modern design touches to keep it moving along: limited decision set each turn, the ability to salvage something out of losing a battle, asymmetric powers, top-notch minis, greater rewards from conquering new territories rather than defending, small number of very connected territories. Despite this our 6 player learning game took 5 hours. 6 players did feel too much as the game was slow in places. In particular the blue dragonfly clan's special power slows the game down a lot. I'd say 4 player, no blue would be the ideal way to play - 5 player if you want a more negotiation-heavy experience. To be super critical I could say this quite derivative of the modern dudes-on-a-map style, but that would be unfair as I think the diplomacy aspect is innovative and sets this game apart. Alliances last a turn (or less) and feel rewarding without being crucial. It also leads the players into NOT making broader/freeform alliances. Maybe it was just because we were new to the game, but I don't think it even occurred to any of us that we could be making alliances outside of the fairly strict rules provided. Quite fascinating, really - by providing a framework within which diplomacy and alliances happen they've actually reduced the impact of alliances on the game. Perhaps this is why I felt I had good diplomacy rounds?

Finally, two aspects of our game weren't impactful - Ronin and Betrayal. Hopefully it was just the way our game played out rather than a systemic issue with these two parts of the game.

All of the snowflakes who are crying about the word Rising Sun and the use of a red sun on a white background need to get a grip. Japan (Nippon) is called Land of the Rising Sun because the sun rises in the East and to the Chinese, it looked like the sun was rising over Japan. Nippon is translated into English as Land of the Rising Sun. I swear, SJWs are the absolute biggest, most transparent, glass jawed, haters on the planet. As for the use of the red sun half exposed on a horizon, not exactly the imperial flag of Japan. Look it up, ya big babies. For the person who points out that it is part of the Edo period, good on ya, you're correct and that period happens to be feudal warlords (daimyōs) allying, betraying, and fighting each other, a theme central to this game. Finally, before you go thinking that I don't have a reason to be upset about an actual Imperial Japanese Flag, I had a Great Grand Father and Great Uncle who were killed on the Bataan Death March. Fulgensio San Luis, may he and his brother rest in peace.

I just played the kickstarter version of this game that included all the fluff.  I thought this game was more presentation than substance.  It just kind of bored me.  We played with three players, two of the three had an alliance for the entire game who were essentially running away with the game.   The setup and breakdown was really time consuming.  The minis were indeed gorgeous but too large for the map.  The game play just never intrigued me to the point where I was engaged or felt challenged/intrigued.

Amazing gameplay, fantastic minis, and tons of options to setup. No game should be the same. Loved it!

Well, I'm not really that much into area-control, "diplomacy" nor bidding. I do like the Japanese theme but overall I will take a lot of convincing to get me to play this again. I'd rather play the A Game of Thrones boardgame, Senji and/or Cyclades

After one play looks like a fantastic game for my group. There is quite a bit going on but you can make decisions and suggest things to other players to help forge your own path. Once we understand the game better I have a feeling the rating will go up even more.

Based on first play. Took quite a while and was huge fun. Cannot tell if clans are balanced imho. Since Blood Rage is quicker and more streamlined they both have their unique values.

Outstanding art and components, looks really nice on the table. Though  Japanese topic seems a bit superficial and dull here. Mechanics probably have been there before theme.

There was an odd phenomenon in our one 4-player game where half the players wouldn't be in a fight each turn. Their money was therefore useless (can't spend it, and it goes away at the end of the season). So, several times people ended up giving away all their money to another party to swing things, or counter another person doing that.

Not sure if this was due to inexperience (not properly maneuvering into enough fights), but it was odd.

I enjoyed it a little more than Blood Rage though. Very chaotic, very points-grabby.

Playtested this and loved it.  It will definately be compared to Blood Rage but it is different enough to justify owning both.  Another brilliant game by The Master!

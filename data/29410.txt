RATING: 10
This is hands down my favorite game and nearly everyone questions my high rating for this one.  It blends many of my game likes into one.  
1) Tactical moves with no ability or need to think more than 1 or 2 moves out (prevents analysis paralysis)
2) Purple Item drop (like playing the lottery for one big payout and quickly dropping to crappy payouts - This is the Activate All Buildings card)
3) Win at 5 victory points so, very little math required.
4) Area (well, bubble) Control - keeping a majority in a region at the right time is the key on this game.

RATING: 6
A light strategy game where the goal is to be the first player to obtain 5 victory coins, and the mechanic is a route-planning, area control game with forced cardplay.

The theme is one of ancient Rome, but as it's a Knizia, its really pretty themeless.  Each turn you can move one or more of your meeples from one building to another (or stay in place), and then you have to play a card- either choose one of your 3 personal cards, or take your chances by flipping a community card.  The actions that occur are things like moving the praefect (where he is dictates the majority "payouts" which are wild cards or meeples- collect 4 different meeple types and you get a coin), activating the powers of the buildings, drawing meeples and placing them in the buildings, etc.

This is actually a pretty decent game that kind of went under the radar somehow.  It's a bit pricey especially for what you get, but it scales nicely from 2-4 players and plays quickly and easy.  Perhaps Knizia's last good game.

A light and simple Euro from Reiner with some interesting choices in the form of special abilities of the Institutions in which you hold majorities. A little luck of the draw, a slight understanding of statistics (no surprise there with the "good doctor", and a push your luck element combine to make this an interesting way to spend some time with friends. I enjoy it.

Municipium is a new gamer's game from Knizia that seems to be worth its while. It is a very fluid, tactical game that revolves around gaining majorities. These majorities let you activate special powers and win various contests that earn you victory points. It sounds like any other game, but actually plays quite differently than most area majority games. 

If you like Knizia games, or want to play a good Euro that resovles in an hour, you should probably check this one out.

One note: the rules have vague sections, the wooden bits suck ass and the cards are flimsy. Valley Games really need to get their act together.

I was pleasantly surprised.  It was more complicated than I thought.  But it was also more engaging and fun.  Too bad the card stock is horrible.  I'll be picking this up.

Update: This is really Knizia's [b]El Grande[/b].  It's a little klunky, but it makes up for it in depth-for-playing-time.  You fit some meaningful decisions into 60 minutes!

RATING: 7
A sort of area control game, but much more fluid than most of this genre.  Controlling an area  brings the possibility of using its special power, of gaining the larger share of its citizens when they are divided up, and of receiving a favour (essentially a wild citizen) from the Praefect when he turns up.  The value of all but the Praefect's favour is very situational and so there a lot of movement.  

In addition to the "you took my area" style of direct interaction common to all area control games, a couple of areas' special powers allow you to mess with other players.  There is a fair degree of luck of the draw, but that seems to balance out over the course of the game.  There is also scope for the sort of clever move that leaves your opponents cursing.

Can't grumble about the production quality of my copy.  Mike Doyle's artwork divides opinion, but I find it both arresting and functional in Municipium.  The rulebook is reasonably clearly written.

RATING: 5
A political eurogame set in ancient Rome. Players try to collect votes and favours. There are 6-7 places on the board where you can sent your family members. Its an area control game so player interaction is high. Very simple rules. Gameplay seems a bit random as you dont know exactly when will each location 'score'. I need to play this more so I can judge it better. I like the artwork on the box.

{1 play • 4 players} Not sure if my rating will go up or down with more play - this is an odd one.  Because I really like the first half, but I'm sure about the endgame.

I could be wrong, but our one play felt like it's one of those games where you kinda do your thing - planning, countering, deciding when to pull the trigger on your special cards - and then the endgame morphs into that everyone-has-to-keep-others-in-check dogpile until one of you inches over the finish.

And if that's true... do I mind that?  Because I might not, if the fun from the first part holds up over time.

a bit of a strange majority game, but nice anyway. It was difficult to find the right strategy and it took us some time to understand all the different powers, but after a while the game came clear.

Among the newer Knizia's that push the outer realms of depth his later games tread. This is an underrated game a tight little area majority game. It feels a little bit dated in terms of mechanics- reminds me a little bit of Louis XIV- you try and get majority of your pawns in areas to grant you special actions. Through these actions you gradually acquire meeples of different colors from which you are trying to make sets. It has a little luck in the card flips, but you also have 3 cards you can use once during the game to bypass the mandatory random card per turn. There's even some push-your-luck type decisions in drawing the meeples from the bag. Most games are very tight and the game plays fairly quick. 35-40 minutes. It's more cutthroat than you might expect; not extremely deep, but provides for some very interesting and tough choices. One thing I noticed from the last play is the ability of the players to sort of reign in the leader. It's subtle but it's enough to sort of keep the game tight through till the end. It can be an excitingly tense game at times which definitely surprised me. The Mike Doyle art work is beautiful on the box and cards. The backs of the cards are especially nice. The art on the board is a little less stylized and overall less successful. In his defense, the board is extremely functional and laid out well. I think I'll keep this in my little Knizia stash. It might not get a ton of table time, but it's a solid game.

I feel I should like this game much more than I actually do.  Yes, it does kind of feel like a retread of various other games.  I am sure we have seen action cards, moving scoring piece and area majority games before, just not all in one place.  And objectively, this is definitely better than the other games with which it shares similarities.

Yet, this is another case where I find refuge with those complaining about "soul" in Knizia games.  There is nothing that really grabs me here.  Nothing mechanically wrong here (this is Knizia after all), but when I look at my gaming closet, my eyes always just glance over Municipium.  And that is maybe the harshest criticism I can give it.

Played one game with four people.

Fun little game that requires you to pay attention to what everyone else is doing.

The engine pushes the game along but, imho, this is not a bad thing as it keeps the game from draggin on longer then it should.

Decision making, time length, randomness, all balanced very nicely in this game. 

Looking for something to fill an hour of your day and have some one with, you cannot go wrong with this one.

RATING: 4
Weird game.  I don't care for it.  The game is in the area control genre, but players have little control.  It's too easy for opponents to mess with you and create big swings in the power balance.  There is simply too much luck from random event cards, random meeple draws, and the location/cards that let you re-arrange ALL of your pieces.

UPDATE 2011: this game is not good with 3 players.  It's too difficult to achieve a power balance... and eventually two people fight or one person attacks the leader and the 3rd guy wins (i.e. the standard 3p game problem sets in).

Very interesting area control game.  It's not the sort of game I'd expect to like -- special powers in the areas, a common deck of cards that cause one of 3 or 4 events each turn to move the game along.  It sounds like a mish-mash of things.

However, it has set collection, which I like and it has a strong race element, which I love.  Players win by having 5 coins.  To get a coin, you need to turn in a set of 4(?) different cubes.  In addition to the common deck, each player has three 1-time use cards.  And each of those cards can often get a player 1 or possibly even 2 coins.  So the game feels like it's piddling along and then a player plays one of his/her special action cards and it's like "oh my god!  they can almost win on their next turn" and all of sudden it's this huge scurry to stop them.  

The game is actually fairly short.  Our first 3-player game clocked in right at an hour and I strongly suspect repeated plays would drop that to the 30 - 45 minute mark.  I don't love it, but I like it.  Not sure if it's a keeper or not.  Initial Rating: 7

RATING: 10
Yeah, an easy 10. It looks like an "area control game", but it isn't really, like many Knizia games it defies easy categorization. While certainly neither Knizia nor Municipium will be for everyone, for those low-raters who call this a "retread" or a "boring area control game", Knizia games - like all worthy endeavors - usually do require a little bit of effort to appreciate. Probably my pick for the game of 2008, although it's slightly murky (while Agricola is less interesting just from a design perspective, it does have huge variety).

As for theme, Municipium is better than most euros. It's not the best Knizia's done in this respect, but that's a pretty high bar. After Beowulf and Blue Moon City, I wish it were a little better, but it's still pretty good.
---
Reiner does it again. An amazingly interesting, subtle game that accomplishes a ton of stuff with a simple, elegant ruleset. Hits the same spot as Beowulf and Blue Moon City, but probably a bit more gamerly. Theme is decent, not as great as Beowulf, but solid and interesting (although some terminology is needlessly dry ... they had to have been able to come up with a better scoring term than "Citizen event"). An easy 9 rating out of the box, and probably rapidly climbing to a 10.

The pleasure in this game seems to be trying to set yourself up to score big on an all powers card or when a lot of citizens show up at once. The rest of the time, most of the time, is just making little moves here and there, trying to score off of wherever the praefect is going next. Both types of play though are very opportunistic in nature. Not a lot of long range thought in this game.

RATING: 5
I’m generally a huge fan of Knizia’s (early) games, but Municipium wasn’t as good as I had expected. Maybe I’m just accustomed to beautiful designs by the good doctor, but this one fell flat for me – and it is clear that it’s more like a Reiner game than a Knizia game... 

With 4, there was not enough control over your own board position and the actions you could take, but, granted, the game was better in the sense that area majority games are always better with more players. Also, it feels a little too random regarding which cards you draw; is it the prefect who moves or is it new meepes or is it a scoring card – this drastically changes what you actually want to do on your turn, but you don’t know it until you turn over the card. It was also somewhat hard to plan ahead and make a strategy with the full complement of players.

Some actions seem better than others; upgrading your meeples early on seem very important as does turnorder as ties are frequent. Granted, we were new players, so maybe I haven’t uncovered the deeper layers, but that’s at least my first impression.

RATING: 7
Nice, colorful game with beautiful graphics.  Reiner Knizia design that I really like.  Game seems a bit short in that it's hard to build up an engine to score well without falling behind and not leaving enough time to catch up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is another very well done Knizia masterpiece.  Definitely something that could be played on a regular basis.  Planning is imperative, but your plans may often go awry based on other players actions.  Certain districts may APPEAR to be better than others, but each district has a particular quality that would make a player say "gee, that is the best one on the board".

To top it off, the artwork is outstanding.  Another Mike Doyle box cover masterpiece.

The game that I played today (07/16/08) is a production prototype, so the cards, board, and other pieces were not the final version.  But Valley Games really knows how to make games, and despite the somewhat lackluster delay-time on the Hannibal Generals that was out of their control, they really do make great games.  Plus, Torben and Ric are really awesome guys.

Great game!

This is a really hard game to rate. It's extremely clean, straightforward, and a little bit retro. There is nothing really new here, but it all works pretty well. Lots of little area majority action going on. Kind of reminds of Kreta. I don't like seeing so much wording on the board/cards. I would have rather seen some simple icons that I could recognize from a distance. I was sort of hoping this would be a return to Knizia's "rich" style of big box game (Tigris, Stephensons, Amun, etc), but sadly this isn't it. Which is probably why this game won't get a good rap, even though it's perfectly fine. But from Valley Games, with fancy Mike Doyle art, it's hard to not expect something a little deeper.

RATING: 6
Reiner Knizia's last 'Big Box Game' before he more or less stopped issuing titles before returning 5 years later with (unfortunately not that good) Qin. Municipium is majorities game featuring same set collection principle as a few other (earlier) titles of his. It takes a while to explain matters because of the number of action fields tied to the majorities, but once play is on the way matters are smooth and rythmical. 

That is not to say that matters are friendly and unassuming. As the number of players goes up, you have to be very agressive in defending your positions, because if you stay out of point-giving 1st and 2nd places you are pretty much dead in the water. It feels unusually confrontational, in any case; which is ... odd. That said, there isn't much to be confrontational over, so after a while it all turns a bit samey. And that's a little disappointing. All in all the game is nice, and if you're a fan of area majorities it's worth a look... but if Municipium is your only majorities game you will grow tired of it sooner than I think is necessary. 

The weird physical appearence of the game isn't helping here either. Cards have this annoying cheap Chinese surface structure; meeples feel like they're made from cork rather than wood; ... . All in all the game gets a lower rate than I would have liked to give it. C'est la vie.

RATING: 8.37456
The game took a long while to explain and there was a feeling of confusion even until the game began but this may be because Nick (explaining the rules) had only played once - 2 years ago!

We took some time to become familiar with the turn structure and various powers but after a couple of rounds, we were progressing at a fast rate.

The various powers seem well balanced despite their assymetry, leading to multiple viable paths to victory. Stealing or doubling a piece seem the most powerful but in any group, this will be self-regulating as not only will better powers be more highly fought over but some of the others will allow you to indirectly win these locations.

The 2 methods of activating citizen-distribution - by either the white piece advancing to a location or 3 citizens gathering at one location - mean that whilst a majority is always good, evaluating where to keep your majorities is interesting, needing to take all 3 factors into consideration - the white piece's position, the population density of each location and the relative powers.

After a good start, I soon fell behind Andy and despite noting Andy's clear lead when he had 2 coins, none of us could catch up. In trying to screw him over, I'd fallen back to 4th.

I could imagine future plays exposing a lot more nuances to the strategy.

Tentative rating after a couple plays. I like it. It's an interesting mix of worker placement and area control, except that controlling the area doesn't guarantee you the action it generates because you don't know when it will take effect. To make it even more interesting it's possible to mess with other players to a small degree via the Tavern, so that helps any potential runaway leader problem, and can breakup a "lead the praefect" strategy.

Thumbs up.

Draw a card or play one of your own. Based on the dictates of the card, (i) maneuver your pieces or the scoring meeples into various regions, or (ii) score a region or regions, or (iii) invoke the power of a region. Try to time things so that you have the majority of pieces in the region that matters to you when it is scored. Knizia didn't exactly think outside the box with this one. I'm losing interest in these kinds of games, although, even when I found them fascinating, I doubt this one would have been among my favorites.

Players are a factional family, trying to corner support in Ancient Rome.  Players take turns moving their pawns around seven buildings in Rome, then triggering a card.  The cards cause some event to take place - a prefect moves and hands out favours, citizens appear and may be handed out to players, or the powers of the buildings may activate and cause things to happen.  Players are trying to collect five "sets" of four different citizens.  Plays fast, turns are snappy, and it's not too difficult to teach or learn.  Nice game.  Downsides?  It looks ghastly - a small board with muddy mush-gray graphics (not sure if this is the actual design or a misprint), ordinary components and not many of them.  The topper.... it smells rotten.... it may move on based on the smell alone.  Ridiculously overpriced in Australia.

This is kind of like a worker placement/area majority hybrid.  It does some interesting things and it does keep it in a short time frame.  While I do appreciate this, I do feel the biggest crux of the game is the luck in the meeples you draw and who gets to draw the powers card.  Luck isn't always bad, but I think San Marco succeeds better as a short/luck based area majority.

Like BMC, Municipium is an efficiency race to acquire a certain amount of points to win the game.  Being a Knizia game, the mechanics have an elegant mathematical nature to them but also feel a bit dry and detached as far as theme is concerned.  I’m glad I played and enjoyed it but I feel that Blue Moon City gives me the same kind of game-play satisfaction.

It feels like an El Grande Light. 7 regions on the board where majorites could either win you a special power or partial points depending on the cards that come up. On your turn you move, and a random event happens, but three times per game you can instead choose one of the 3 events from your hand.

First impression: I like this a lot, very simple but interesting.  The game flows in a circle around the board where you try to get majorities.  Not too many mechanics going at once.  I like the design and I look forward to playing it again.  I prefer this much more than Blue Moon City because it seems like a cleaner design, nothing like BMC's dragon scales to keep track of and it doesn't have so many different kinds of cards that all do pretty much the same thing.  After playing many other games it's refreshing to play a new Knizia game and understand the heart of the game right away.  It feels like it's been edited down to a bare bones set of mechanics without a bunch of side tracks.    As for Valley games, the rules that came with the game could have been clearer on a couple things (at least to me) and it's a bit overpriced for what you get.  High marks for artwork as well.  I think the game is good and has lots of replay, discovering the value of adjacent buildings is interesting and it has a 'take that' element with the Tavern as well as cooperative benefits with the Praefects arrival.

Can't wait to play it again!

Fairly straight forward area control game where you move your pieces around trying to be the majority/minority, with a few special actions/events that come up in a set order (you just don't know how soon). Easy to grasp once familiar with the actions (otherwise, it's quite a bit of text on the board). 

The theme is definitely pasted on this one and we weren't quite sure where all the little pieces belonged on the board but no real complaints otherwise.

Valley Games edition - Component quality is very poor (as I find typical of games 'Made in China').  The meeples are made from low density wood and many are misformed.  The board is covered in excess glue and the printed surfaces peeling from the fold edges.

Municipium is a short and fairly chaotic area majority game. Control is constantly changing, and the correct timing is largely dependent on the card draw that happens at the end of each turn. There are, however, only three distinct kinds of events so that does give you something to work with. Considering the amount of luck in the game, it's a game to be played quickly, and after the initial few rounds in which the different location special powers slow things down a bit that should certainly be possible.

For some reason this game just works for me.  I feel happy every time I play it.  It is hard to explain why.  The theme is just ok, the production has its flaws, but it is just plain fun and doesn't drag on unnecessarily.  Each game I have played has been close.  A Knizia winner (something I hardly ever say)!

Better than the ratings let on, Municipium is a game that probably would have sucked if it was not for Reiner Knizia holding the reins of this rather luck-driven, but certainly strategic game of majority control. All the actions certainly work well together and you never feel like you are wasting your turn. You do have to plan to get ahead, but also have to hope that luck will fortune your smooth play. I was glad to try this Knizia that probably will never see a reprint but has a couple good ideas in it that should be incorporated in other games.

RATING: 3
This is a real stinker, primarily because it commits the worst of all crimes - mediocrity. It feels random, and processional at the same time.  Chaotic and boring at the same time.  Municipium is about as uninspired and derivative a design as I have played in a long time.  There is a game here, but it all seems entirely accidental as to whether or not you place first or last.  I have been holding out, waiting for the next great Knizia - Municipium is definitely not it.  With recent playings of Stephenson's Rocket as well as Taj, and Tigris (latter two on the computer) I have really begun to appreciate the bygone days of euro design.  Municipium is truly awful.  It is quick however.

Solid Knizia's game. Like many of his others games, there is more on the picture than the eyes can sees at first glance. Short term planning and probabilities estimation (easy with only 12 cards) is a key.

RATING: 7.5
Three plays with two, four plays with three, and five plays with four. I like it best with three. 

Players are collecting sets of Roman citizens by having the majority of influence in seven areas. Meanwhile, those same area majorities will periodically grant players special abilities. What's unusual about the game is the way that the turns work; each player gets to make two moves with his pawns, after which he turns over a card from a twelve-card deck to see how the turn ends. The possibilities are that the praefect moves (the praefect being a pawn that triggers one type of scoring), more citizens are put on the board, or the areas' special powers are activated. Remembering which cards have come out and knowing what's left in the deck will give a player a significant advantage. Players also have three family cards that they can use once each instead of turning over a card from the common deck.

My initial reaction to Municipium was lukewarm, but as I've played it more and more I've really come to enjoy it. Some of my opponents have felt that there's too much luck involved coming down the home stretch, but my feeling is that if you're crossing your fingers and hoping for the right card to flip at the endgame, then you used your "My Powers" cards too soon. Ideally you want to have one or two of these ready for a late-game [i]coup de grace[/i].

Update: Even though I've always thought that Municipium had a lot of promise and that it might really shine on repeated plays, I must confess that I've never been able to get anyone else that excited about it. Maybe it's too opaque? It just doesn't seem to grab people for some reason.

Very interesting and novel, and I personally don't object to the random deck draws at all. What does bother me is the chaos and how much the board can shift between turns.

RATING: 8
This may not be the good Doctor's greatest, but it seems woefully underrated to me. Municipium combines area majority with worker placement in a fresh and compelling way. Getting the majority in an area lets you take the action available there, which seems pretty standard (think Royal Palace). The big wrinkle is that you don't know for sure when you'll actually be able to get that action--figuring out the best time and place to commit your guys is crucial. It moves quickly and keeps everyone involved, and it's over before you know it. The presentation is great, and I like that the rules reminders are all right there on the board in English-- you don't have to decipher or look up anything. I wish more games were printed this way. First impression's a solid 8, I could see this moving up.

I'm a sucker for area-control games, and this is an interesting one.  I like the way that control can change quickly, since it is pretty easy to move your family members around the board and you often have a strong incentive to do so.  The set collection aspect of this game makes this possible.  I suspect it is very important to learn how to manage your one-time cards, and I will consider them more carefully next time I play.  Very good game--fluid, interesting, and just different enough to be worthwhile. Meeple hats are really cool. (2 plays)

Jan10:

Completely Meh.  We played it 2-player.  It totally said it could be played 2-player.  It played like crap.  The whole game took about 15 minutes.  And they weren't that hard fought thinky kind of 15 minutes.  It was more 15 minutes of handing out meeples.

With two players, it was more just "stay ahead of the prefect" and "trigger my cards when they help me most".  We were plenty spread out since second in places gets you meeples.

The building powers were kind of neat.  I think we activated the buildings all of maybe 3 times each before the game ended.  (We didn't make it all the way through the public stack, so just once each with our power cards and we flipped one of the "1 Action" public cards.)

There wasn't really any choice in placing or taking meeples.  Take the ones you need while stiffing them.

The components were only okay.  The board was way too stiff and hard to tell where the roads were.  The favor tokens were tiny, and I don't know why there were coins instead of a score track.

Anyway, I don't feel the need to revisit.

Quite enjoyable while playing but the luck element is a little too big and there is a bit of kingmaking or gang on the leader going on as well.  Fairly easy to learn and very easy to play, game time was good too. 

I found it to be mostly all tactics, planning was barely there but some possible, you do need to set yourself up to be in the right place at the right time and then hope for a good pull of guys or the right card (or burn one of your precious 3).  Decent but fairly light and a good dose of luck, this seems to be the way for Knizia of late, would sure like to see at least one more serious title come out.

Nicely produced (apart from the decapitated merchant piece in my set!) Knizia game, with simple rules allowing very open gameplay as per many of his best games.

Very fluid situation (especially for a game with an area control element, which often build slowly over the length of the game) requires tactical rather than strategic thinking, meaning analysts may bog down (and possibly bog the game down) as there are many possible outcomes from any given situation, but for me it's fun to play.

I really like this game.  It's really just area control, but it feels like there is so much you can do.  The special powers of all the buildings and how they can interact make it really interesting.  There's usually a point early in the game when you can pull off a move that lets you execute 3 or 4 different building powers, which can set you up nicely for the win.  Still, the game always feels tense throughout.

*N.B.  Don't play your first game starting at 6 a.m. suffering from serious sleep depravation.

Rating after 1 play.

A majorities game where players look to have the most influence in different regions to grab the desired resources. Each area has a power that can be activated during the course of the game and the two most influential people in the region get rewarded. A turn is simple as you can move up to two spaces and then play an event card. The game plays in about an hour.

I would say this is Knizia's best game in 5 years (since Ingenious and Blue Moon City were published in 2004 - but admittedly I have not played Keltis). How good does that make it? More interesting than most, for sure. This is a medium-weight majority game, in the same family as Bridges of Shangri-La and Schacht's Web of Power series of games. My personal feelings towards those games is a mild admiration and Municipium is no different.

I generally don't care for games where card counting gives an advantage. Those who can track what is left in the common deck before a re-shuffle have a huge advantage over those who can't track it. But I do recognize the subtle range of possibilites and combinations the institution powers and special cards present, and I think fans of medium-weight majority games will find a lot to like here.

This game has Knizia's name all over it, and not just literally. The rules are dripping with the kind of elegant and well balanced game mechanics Knizia is so well known for. My only complaint is that it's a little too predictable... there isn't really anything new or exciting in the game, though it's a very solid game.

RATING: 7
A clever and quick take on area control. Although it's a whole different genre and it appeared a handful of years earlier, Municipium has an [gameid=148949] vibe with the similar goal of getting five tokens first. Knizia's signature can be seen in devising three different ways to score the same majorities. While Municipium can be an unfair game with the possibility for a player to hopelessly fall behind, it's short enough that this doesn't matter too much. I like it a bit better with three but it's fine with four players as well.

I think this game has a lot going for it, in terms of knowing where to place things and when to place them, balancing the various abilities and having to collect colors.

RATING: 7
First - the game is overpriced for what you get, if this was published by RGG the list price would be probably at least $15 less than it is now.  Second - contrary to majority opinion, I really like the box art.  It's nice to see something different, and the graphic design, especially on the rules, is unique and visually pleasant.  However I'm disappointed with the board.  The board seems so uninspired and derivative of other German games that Doyle's design has no breathing room to be original.

The game itself benefits from no/low expectations, as it is very clever and fun if played quickly.  This could easily be a 30 minute game and would be wonderful as such.  The decisions are minimal (which is a good thing in my book) and if turns were quick this would actually feel fresh instead of like some area majority derivative.

So, the main ways to improve this game are, IMO - play quickly, redesign the board and retheme the game.  What a boring theme!  It would be way better as a game of rival gangs of girls spreading rumors about each other, trying to persuade the weak and hapless to join their side.

Herr Knizia's best 'middleweight' original game since Blue Moon City (it has more weight and needs more thinking, also you have lots more possibilities for combination and risk-taking).
It scales well: it feels different with 4 than with 2 though. With 2 you get more advantage from the 'all powers' and 'your powers' cards, at the same time there is no 2nd place reward in case of a praefect visit, and the citizen visits provide also less citizen on the board.
The game lasts approx. 15 mins/player, so while it's not extremely short, it is a fine 30-min. game with 2.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Outside of the horrendous production values where I find the board garishly ugly and refusing to lie flat, the game itself is actually quite interesting.  It is a race to be the first to earn 5 coins by turning in sets of citizens that you collect through various means of being in majority in 6 different areas when the prefect moves or through citizen events which occur whenever three citizens come to one of the locations.  Each location also has a special power that the person in control can activate if the right card comes up or is played.  Some interesting little twists that can be frustrating as it can come down to whomever is luckiest when drawing citizens at the end.  However, I didn't really find that to detract from the game much from my end.  Definitely one of Knizia's better games in recent years (although I'm not certain that's really saying much!).

06/05/11 Played a three-player game. 
There's nothing new or exciting about Municipium. But I found it worthy of additional plays. Like many Knizia games it has atmosphere, but the theme doesn't bear close examination. (Example: how do the pawns *magically* travel from the Baths to the Temple though no road runs between these two buildings?) I thought the board looked serviceable, and the wooden components were adequate. But the cards could have been much better. I assume the developer was trying to make them look ancient and Roman. But the font used and the fake "yellowing of age" on them just made the brown text hard to read. I look forward to seeing how it plays with four.

This is a game of tough choices. I like it a lot and feel it has a lot of depth for its short duration and small rules set. The kind of distillation that Knizia is great at but, unlike most of his games, it also has some appeal for me. (Often his games make me ask: 'Is that it?'.) 

Maybe I like it because there's a chaotic element; I'm not sure. Many games perceived as 'pure' on this site leave me cold, so I try not to over-analyse the ones that work well for me.

Can be prone to AP, but don't hold that against it. Worth a look for anyone who likes games that require you to make the best of some bad choices.

First play was  a little long, but it was late and some players tended to overthink their options. I would gladly play again, but I'm not sure I need to own it.

Shockingly good. By all reports, I thought this would be a 6 at best, and that only because we really like Knizia games and would give him the benefit of the doubt despite lukewarm feelings.

But instead, I really enjoy this game. It's got great components and is extremely easy to explain. There's some nice opportunities for little tactics and combos here and there to give you the upper hand. Moves you think are pretty smooth might surprise you by opening up new opportunities for your opponent. It's a rare area control game that works well with two, and it's blazingly quick. Thumbs up.

Worker placement & area control game where you try to win over 4 different types of people. First with one of each type wins.

In order to win over the different types of people, you have to have either majority or minority of influential family members on the areas that they arrive in.

Would want to try out first.

I like how you are vying for position in the different regions to gain control of certain actions. The ability to move your men around makes for the possibility of certain combo moves and makes the game somewhat unpredictable, but not chaotic. It seems like it might be difficult to  come from behind, and the randomness of the card flip can swing the game to a player's favor, but I'm not sure if that's insurmountable.

RATING: 7
I did not expect much, but was pleasantly surprised. This is a rather neat little area influence game with a short playing time. 

Since the deck consists of 12 cards only, card counting is way too easy, which means serious analysis paralysis moments. I'd prefer a significantly larger deck, which would also allow for those precious moments of successful topdecking.

Overpriced, considering the gameplay content, but at least the graphics do not interfere with the gameplay.

RATING: 6
An exceedingly peculiar Knizia with the sudden-death mechanic that tends to divide opinion. Whether it deserves to stand alongside other Knizia greats is hard to determine, but at least it's nice to see him a little off the well-beaten track for once. The sprinkling of luck in the communal deck draw is unusual but not excessive and - on reflection - utterly necessary.

RATING: 6
A game of eking out slender majorities across the 7 locations at the right time and taking advantage of the special power each location has when you have its majority. Locations are scored in two different ways - on a randomly timed rotational basis and on a random pull from the bag basis, and scoring gets you different coloured men. Trade in a set of differently coloured men 5 times and you win. Some locations seem to have more attractive powers than others (the power to win ties for example), so the choice is whether to concentrate your forces in the fight for these or spread yourself more thinly over locations. Your 2 movement points each turn (to move your pawns between the locations) is not enough to allow you to alter your strategy so if you fall off the pace, it seems difficult to make a comeback. It's also easy to get frustratingly swamped after your turn if it's about to score but doesn't at the end of your turn, making for some random results. It seems a clean enough system, just not all that interesting from turn to turn with only the little you can do, and the only tension being whether you get the card you want at the end of your turn (ie not much). As usual in a majorities game, a lot of your result will be determined by how much you're left alone at the fortunate times. Replay might come about by exploring different power combinations to fight for, but there are only 7 powers. I'm not sure this is going to see much table time as a result.

RATING: N/A
Reiner Knizia's recent games haven't been received very well, but the comments I could find on this one made it sound decent, and BoardGameGuru had it for the excellent price of £10. It's a kind of area-majority game, but not a standard one as control of the different areas is very transient. On your turn, you can move two of your 'family members' between areas and then you activate either a random action card from a deck, or one of your three one-time-use personal cards. This being a Knizia game, the aim is to collect sets of colours, each of which you can trade in for a coin; first to five coins wins. What makes it fun, and moderately thematic for a Knizia, is that each area has a different special power that occasionally gets activated by the current majority-holder. These range from dragging other players' tokens to the Tavern to crowning one of your tokens with a laurel wreath (making it count double from then on). There is a fair bit of luck inherent in the card draw, but you can certainly prepare for the possible outcomes as there aren't many different ones. You also need to time the use of your personal cards well as they can give you a huge boost towards the finish line. This is a solid middleweight 60-minute game (a category which Knizia is the master of) and it deserves to be much higher-ranked than its lowly 665.

The art looks very enticing.  The many comments about it being abstract, pasted theme, etc, these sound odd to me. How is it different from every euro?  Settlers, El Grande, Goa? Abstract, all.  

Yet good art and design can make an abstract formulation of cubes come alive. That's what a eurogame [i]is[/i].  And if the formula underlying the play backs up the theme, then you will have a very good game.  Knizia excels at this.

This little area control game gives you a ton of different options in a short time.  You can concentrate of making your pieces more valuable, breaking ties, or one of a number of ways to get you the pieces you need to collect victory points.  Each area you control gives you a different ability, but you're never sure when you'll get to use that ability, keeping people on their toes.  Of course, if you really need something right away, you can use one of your once-per-game cards, giving you a reasonable amount of control when you need it.  All in all, an excellent game for area control fans.

Solid new game by Reiner Knizia. You have to become somewhat familiar with the powers of the different locations of the board before you understand the strategic possibilities. Unfortunately, the design of the board is bad: the only things that have to be clear are the connections between the locations, and the different actions, but the artistic lay-out of the board caused some confusion about the first, and the small, unclear icons used for the latter were unrecognizable from any distance. Nevertheless, good game.

Semi-abstract worker placement & movement game. Cards are used to invoke special abilities that can radically change the board, making long-term planning less valuable than opportunism.

A return to form from Knizia? well, not quite. a great set collecting and area control mechanic. It plays relatively quick, it's easy to teach, but there's a lot of strategic and tactical depth underneath. My only complaints are with the components. My board came out of the box grimy, the wooden meeples are of poor quality, and the cards feel horrible to the touch. Even the box and insert seem incredibly flimsy. The Chinese manufacturing is apparent. If I had paid full retail, I'd feel ripped off. With better components, I'd rate it at least one point higher

--May2009-- Happy to have bought it.  Interesting light temporary-majority game.  It's quite accessible and plays cleanly.  I'm not at all sure how many plays are represented here before I tire of the experience - but I definitely need to play with 3 or 4 players.

Probably the last true gamer's game Knizia has got published. And even that license was only bought by a very small publisher and so there's little hope for an international release ever. 

Original, nice looking game of changing majorities and set collection. Short playing time, can be done in half an hour. Doesn't feel dry or overly abstract. Light but clever.

Some Institution Powers seem weaker than others at first, but beware! There are some cool synergy effects here you wouldn't expect from mere reading the rules.

An area majority game where you're looking for special action combinations to reach the four coin victory conditions. There's good choices and plenty of player interaction. You're likely to be lost on your first play while you work out how the special actions can be combined, and it's an unforgiving game due to it being a quick game. Repeated plays will see more milage and enjoyment out of this one.

Worker Placement, Area Control. Interesting take on area control. The board is rather fluid - each player has 7 people with which to continually contest 7 areas, but the shuffled deck of 12 actions make it uncertain which effect or area will trigger next, so there's a lot of evaluating position and weighing the odds of the next actions. Not terribly much analysis paralysis, though. It feels very tight - in the sense that you have to make tough choices about where to move and what to do. Nice game, especially for the play time (I'm thinking easily in an hour after a learning game).

What a nice return to for for Knizia.  I'd truly lost faith in any ability that he had to design a new game.  I'm still a little floored by the fact that this isn't just some secret revamp of a game he did 10 years ago (although, I'm jaded enough to still be suspect).

This is a fun little area majority game, the game is mostly timed by card flips, so you have to play the odds.  There are a number of great decisions to make, and most everything you do (other than taking control of a region) will inadvertently help another player, so many of your decisions are also based on who you are helping.   

The timing, of course, can make or break you, but rather than feeling overwhelmingly lucky, it feels exciting. 

It is light and fast and is over before you know it, but doesn't feel insubstantial.  

Funny gripes: 1. There was no "zero" in Rome. 2. The money would have been shaved to the dots and if the money went past the dots it would be worthless as coin.

I like the pieces, the theme and the set collection aspect of this one.  However, it seems that you don't have quite enough decisions that you can make and there is a little too much luck in this one.  I'd have to play one more time before truly finalizing the rating... could go a touch up or down.

RATING: 5
I guess I don't enjoy area control games as much as most.  Maybe they just feel claustrophobic instead of fun.  Municipium would benefit from a player aid card that explains the powers for each location.  I know it's on the board, but it's difficult to read from certain positions and you don't want your opponents observing which section you're reading.  I don't see much originality here and it just felt like a standard euro to me, nothing to new or interesting.  I can see where most will enjoy it more than me.

Excellent game. Very well balanced, interesting strategies, can be played under an hour. After my first play I gave it a 9; now I see it as more of an 8.5 due to a couple of issues. I'm not sure the completely random moving of the prefect and citizen events are a plus. I think in a better game they would be triggered only by players deliberately (perhaps a limit of 3 times per game). That would not eliminate "card counting" but would add some control. Bash the leader is also not a great way for games to end. Still overall very fun game to me though.

Area control games are usually shockingly dull; I'm completely burnt out on them.

What a wondeful surprise then to find Municipium which is fluid, tactical and great fun to play. Classically good game design; there is nothing here more than is required to make a clever, fast, meaningful game.

Update: It's a little opaque, and even gamers tend to find their first game or so seems random. There's actually a decent amount of control here though. Not one I'd teach to newbies, despite the few rules.

Sometimes the game can result in kingmaker situations and the game is much better when that doesn't happen. If it doesn't it is an exceptional game.

Municipium (2008): El juego diseñado por Knizia para Valley Games es un juego de mayorías que aporta frescura contra todo lo que se podía pensar. La partida dura en torno a los cuarenta y cinco minutos y tiene una dosis justa de azar. El juego me ha recordado a Palais Royal por alguna mecánica que comparten (obtener mayorías en determinados lugares para conseguir acciones). Sin embargo, mientras aquel me dejó algo frío, este me ha dejado con ganas de repetir partida. En este caso, no puedo decir otra cosa que preferir un juego u otro es más cuestión de gustos que de calidad. La pega de Municipium es que es extremadamente caro para el tipo de juego que es.

Was surprised by this. It was one of the first games I bought (attracted by the Roman setting), but I've been seduced by flashier games since.

Municipium is pretty interesting: an area control game where the areas bestow special powers and abilities. Players have plenty of options and a lot of room for clever play. My one quibble is this presents a lot of leader-bashing opportunities and seems almost overly balanced, if there can be such a thing. Five coins are needed to win, and four different citizens are needed to produce one coin. This game invariably comes down to having all players at four coins and two or three of the four citizens needed for the victory, with the win seeming to fall into the lap of whichever player manages to fly under the radar screen and get bashed the least. I found Municipium somewhat engaging, but ultimately not quite fun or challenging enough that I need to own it, especially given the leader-bashing randomness of the end game.

This is a nasty "area majority" game. It is great, plays fast, and the rules are simple. The problem is that the first time you will play it you will realize that if you don't act quickly to use your personal cards at the right times, you don't have any chance to win. Components are very nice (I like the touch with the hats). The best aspect of the game is that plays under 1 hour with 4 players.

First impression: 
This was a disappointment for me. A tough thing for me to say because I am such a Knizia fan. The game appears to have all the elements of a classic Knizia: simple rules, elegant game play with strategic depth. Alas, I am not sure if I truly grasp this game. For starters, the temple tie-breaking powers are just too vital and the ability to alter the tie-breaks is just not easy to achieve. To get a majority in the temple district is one thing, but having the right cards to trigger the institution is another. Starting order is critical and the start player appears to have an advantage due to tie-breaking abilities. The luck of drawing the right card at the right time also breaks the game in unexpected ways. You can position yourself in the path of the Praetor, but if the right power card do not appear, you could easily lose your majority in the subsequent turns. 

it is possible that after repeated plays with the same group, some emergent properties will emerge and a narrowly focused strategy can be drawn up. But in this day and age, half a dozen games is 5 games too many. Games have to impress in the first few plays or they run the risk of being relegated to the trade pile.

At present, I am ambivalent about the game. I would want to try another round before I give up on the game. This is a Knizia after all and I believe it deserves another shot.

Another recent purchase.  The temple's a bit unbalanced in two-player.  With three it was much better.  We still seem to be lacking a strategy.

Games are better as we're remembering enough to start formulating some strategies.

The game is interesting now that we can just jump in and remember what everything does enough to start planning and pulling stunts.  I have a feeling that this may be a candidate for a 9.  Maybe I should look for a 9 to demote.

Fairly overlooked Knizia area control/set collection game from Valley Games. Move your family members into different areas of the board, and those areas give you an ability if you have the majority there when various events happen. Areas allow you to upgrade your family members, move people around the board, place and collect citizens, etc. Collecting a full set of citizens scores you a point, winner is first to five.

There's a fair bit of randomness, as you're turning over cards which determines which events happen, and kick off the evaluating of majorities. It's a tiny deck, just 12 cards, so often you set yourself up, then hope you turn up the right card. But I enjoyed the game, and the meeples are fantastic, with the rings you place on their heads as laurel wreaths.

(12/08)  I am a fan of Knizia so I will try any of them and this one did not disappoint.  Lots of things going on and many choices to be made in an effort to acquire your sets of "meeples".  Will definitely play again and look forward to trying it with 4.

Ok area control game, but too messy with the different location and card special abilities and too random with the meeple and card draws.

For all the facade of different things going on, after two plays I've found there isn't much there that grabs me. It may be appreciated by many as a light-to-middle-weight game, but my time is better spent playing something else.

A prime mechanism of Roman expansion and control in the provinces was the municipium (pronounced Myu-ni-KIP-pee-um), the premiere Roman provincial town. Being granted the status of a municipium brought a town into the Roman orbit and involved both duties to Rome and a gradual extension of the Roman citizenship to the inhabitants.

This game takes place in one of these municipalities in a western province. The time is the middle of the 2nd Century AD, when the Empire had reached its greatest territorial extent and was enjoying its longest period of imperial peace.
\13\\13\
Players are each in control of a powerful family and try to strategically place their family members in the various institutions throughout the municipium and gain the support of the citizens: Scholars, Merchants, Soldiers, and Priests. At various times during the game, if a player has the most influence in an institution, the player can exert the power of that institution and gain the support of certain citizens. Meanwhile, the praefect moves around the municipium and players strive to have the most influence in the institutions that he visits, thereby earning his favour. Each of these institutions have unique powers, and players must decide how and when to use them. The player best utilizing their power will become the most influential family in the municipium.

A good Knizia effort that falls in the family solid 7 category.  Timing the use of special powers is important.  On the downside, the retail cost of $55 for this game is ridiculously high for what it is and what's in the box.

Looks good and plays brilliantly. Simple but thinking cap needed. Options options options. Quick to learn and play. Works extremely well with 2 - and if it does with more then I will rerate as a 10.

Easy to explain and plays in an hour.  A lot of interaction between abilities means that you can really accomplish some things with your moves, despite having very little you can do on any one turn.  But, pacing is kind of weird.

classical Knizia, unfortunately it is undeservedely out of the first 1000 games... how is this possible?? sometimes i cant understad BGG community.

Here you have a fast paced simple interesting multifaceted game where you always have to do something, you can plan ahead, you have different strategies(do i try to be first in the temple? do i try to have a lot of laureated family members?) , very very balanced. What is it that you don't like to make it so low in your rating?
Unbelieveable.
It is not Knizia's best game but it gave us a good tense 1 hour game. I'll play it again for sure

I rather enjoyed this game, but I really enjoy this type.  I like the different powers of the different areas. In our group, the bath house was really undervalued.  In a longer game, it can become the most powerful early.

so far a very liteweight Knizia game. I'm not sure I like the openness to the game where it's too easy to pick on the leader, so might be yet another game where it doesn't pay to be the one who appears to be doing well in the first 3-4 rounds.

RATING: 7
Interesting worker placement game. The game is about collecting sets of citizens. Each space on the board has 2 ways to collect citizens and a special action. Have the most or second most workers in a space when it scores and you gain citizens. Fun and relatively quick.

A decent middleweight area majority gamer's game. Very tactical. I'm not a huge fan of area majority, but I like this one.

Area majority on 7 areas; you move your pieces around. The player with the majority in an area sometimes collects meeples and/or tokens which eventually become points. Sometimes the majority holder gets to exercise the special power of an area instead; each of the 7 areas has a unique special power. Some interesting decisions: Do you put your meeples where the next scoring event is likely to happen, or do you put them in areas that have special powers you need? And which powers will actually help you most right now?

If you like area majority, you should definitely try this. Not a family game though; the special powers and the way that points are collected is fairly complex.

this was an interesting game.  it is a little chaotic the first time, as you're not too sure what each location does, and it seems a little hard to get what you need going.  but if you latch onto a location that has a decent power, you can do pretty well.  very straight-forward scoring for a Knizia game.

6 after 1 play

Main game mechanic is easy to understand and teach. However, game is not scalable. In particular, it doesn't work with two players as the tiebreaker from controlling the temple is overly strong. Artwork is poor and game component quality seems to be below average.

This game is cool...you move your pieces around to control areas for their powers and rewards, be at the right places, at the right times...the quick, tight turns sort of feel like four kung-fu masters fighting in a 10'x10' room with no gravity (a variation of the "knife-fight-in-a-phone-booth") instead of four Roman families vying for political power...

A pretty neat area control game where you can't be entirely certain the best areas to control and when.  This goes well with the race-ish scoring, but the luck required to make that kind of uncertainty could put off some people.  Luck of the meeple draw... luck of the card draw... Still a fun time if you know what you're getting into, but I'd have been bummed if I paid full price for this one.  As it is Municipium won't be making it into my rotation of similar length games (Taluva, Samurai, Metropolys, Pompeii) though I'd like to give it at least one more shot before putting it on the trade pile.

This has a lot of good tension.  The luck of the draw affects a lot, but there is plenty of opportunity for strategy to sway the game your way.  Very cool bits, and nice work on the art by Mike Doyle.

1/1/12 -- I got rid of this game when I thought I'd be moving onto a boat.  I never did, but the game's gone regardless.  Though it's gone, I still hold it in high esteem.

06/01/2010 - This "area influence" game is unlike most I've played in that the amount of influence you can exert on the board is fixed throughout the game, meaning that if you want to be #1 somewhere, you have to give it up elsewhere.  By contrast, El Grande (for example) lets you continually add new influence to the board, which creates an arms-race type of feeling that I don't care for and which is absent in Municipium.  Municipium is short, simple-to-learn, thought provoking and engages you with the other players rather than solely with the board (a Knizia trademark).  It's an easy game to take for granted because it makes game design look easy, but you'll be hard-pressed to find games of this caliber coming out from other designers with any frequency.

Ergonomically, the game functions fine, although the the art is a little drab and the production is not as nice as many games.  Thematically, the game is well executed, although Knizia-haters will find reasons to call the subject matter "pasted on" (what is a "Citizen Event" in real-life?) as they always seem to. 

Anyway, this game is super.  Play it.

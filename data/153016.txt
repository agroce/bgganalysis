The commercial verion of Eat Poop You Cat.  Best party game ever.

Most fun when you play the 'Eat Poop You Cat' way (ie players just make up the secret word/phrase).

I played this game only three times, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

I'm not a big party game person. I usually find them decent but I very rarely go further than that. Therefore should come as no surprise that I find Telestration to be merely an OK game. 

I think the idea of turning Pictionary on its head and make it a silly game is a brilliant one. It actually makes it become a good game for a party situation, because it makes it quick, it's still able to accommodate a bunch of people but especially it becomes fun and silly. That being said, I don't particularly enjoy it, because the fun of the game is to go together through the flip-book and see how things degenerate in weird ways. I enjoy that part a lot... problem is that that part comes after 15-20 minutes of people drawing. Sure there's the occasional laughter during this phase, but I still don't enjoy drawing enough to have fun doing it for 20 minutes.

I can surely see how Telestration is a good party game and a clever idea but, since this is my rating and it's based on my taste, I can't give it more than a 5,5. I think it's alright, but I would rather play something else most of the times.

RATING: 8
The point of this game is to laugh, specifically at other people's (lack of) artistic skills. Technically this game can be played with pencils and sheets of paper, but the dry erase flip books keep everything organized and reusable. I would give this game a 9 if it wasn't over-produced. All you really need are the flip books, markers and erasers. You can throw out the clue/inspiration cards and the rulebook. I put eveything I need in a box 1/3 the size of the original. If you are keeping score in the game you are missing the point. If you are using those clue cards as your starting description you will probably be disappointed (instead of pleased) to find that your description never actually got distorted. You wrote "spider", the next person drew a spider, the next person wrote "spider", the next person drew a spider, etc. Yawn. I've found that the funniest clues usually are long sentences, inside jokes, emotions, and awkward situations. I've had some belly-aching laughs while playing this game and I always bring it to parties.

RATING: 9.5
Our favorite party game hands down.  No drawing skill required, in fact it is better with less drawing skills.

The passing, drawing and guessing is what we call the "Canadian Phase" as in our groups everyone passes right or left along with pleadings of "I am so sorry" because they ran out of time to draw a key element, or they know it is unrecognizable chicken scratches, heh.

The game comes to life once that is all done, that is basically 'setup' for the exposition of how these simple phrases went so horribly wrong in this drawn version of 'telephone'

Score or not, no biggie. We like to score to not so much so anyone wins, but it is nice to acknowledge people who made clever drawings or guessed sometime correct from an awful drawing.  Or even made a very logical wrong guess from a misleading drawing.  Always huge laughs as people try to defend their drawing or guess and then get glorious turnabout when their turn comes around to show what happened in their train-wreck of a binder.

I'm aware this is a money grab of a game that you can otherwise play with a piece of paper and a pencil.  It's still hysterical fun.  My minor quibbles are (1) the words/phrases they give you aren't always that interesting (2) the dry erase pads mean you don't get to keep any of the hysterical chains that were created. (also (3) the cloth "erasers" stop working after awhile).

Very fun party game...or activity.  It's like the game telephone, but with illustrations.  A person starts off with a word of which they draw an illustration depicting that word.  It's then passed to the next person who only sees the illustration and they guess what the word is.  It's passed on to the next person who draws a picture of the word written, and so forth until it arrives back to the original owner.  Then the group shows the other peoples answers and how it evolves or stays the same.

This is the only version you should get!  (If you get the 6-player version, you'll soon be wishing for this version.) 
 Pull this game out at large parties for a huge hit and make sure everyone shares the story of what happened to their secret word over time.  Also, the more new people you play with, the better the MC needs to be at explaining and keeping the group on track.  So, play with fewer people at first then ramp up to the huge group.

Fun game that is better the more people you have. Some of the cards are a little too simple, if everyone can draw the item and guess it then it's pretty boring.

Also having people come up with a sentence sounds fun too

[b]DON'T BUY THIS GAME.[/b] Save your money and reduce your impact on the environment. Go buy a ream of 8.5"x11" printer paper, and a box of pencils and call it what it is, EAT POOP YOU CAT! When all is said and done, you can recycle the paper, or frame the best drawings, and give them back to the owners as presents. 

My vote for the game with the worst art, because you suck at drawing.

This game is absolutely side-splitting, face-hurting, doubled-over-laughing hilarious! My family loves this game. Even though you'll need to draw pictures, your players need no talent whatsoever in drawing; in fact, the worse that your players can draw, the more funny the game turns out to be. Just buy it. You won't regret it.

A combination of telephone and Pictionary. I played this years before it came out with a stack of paper and a pencil, and loved it, so I was excited to see it had been published in a more polished form. Play with 12 if at all possible. The more players you have, the wilder it can get.

I will fully admit that this is not really a game in the traditional sense.  It is a VERY fun activity to play with a bunch of friends, though.  (There are scoring rules, but nobody uses them.)  Famously also known as Eat Poop, You Cat, this is game of Telephone played with drawings.  Everyone playing has a little booklet with dry erase pages.  You start off with a phrase and write it down.  Everyone else does the same and passes their book to the next person.  The next person then tries to draw this concept.  They then pass and the next person writes down what they think the phrase is.  They then pass it and the next person tries to draw that.  It keeps going and in the end, you will laugh because of the crazy changes that happened through each booklet.  You can't play this without laughing a lot!  :-D  A real winner.  A new favorite party game of mine.  This version plays to 12 players, by the way.  There is also a 6 player version and an 8 player version.

12 players is better than 8; 6 rounds are better than 4. If it's available, get this over standard Telestrations. The flipbooks have extra sheets, so just having 2 copies of Telestrations doesn't achieve the same effect.

Easily the best party game I've ever played. It does everything a party game should. Everyone who can read can play it. You don't even have to be able to draw. In fact, the game's better if you can't draw! In my opinion, the one thing that consistently kills party games is too much competition. A lot of people who play party games aren't there to necessarily win so much as they're there to have fun, including people like myself who normally are very competitive with board games. This game fixes that by just removing the competitions entirely. There is technically a way to play with teams, but you really shouldn't. Just play through, and make sure to have everyone show off their drawing history at the end. That's where this game really shines through.

Ordered this based on how many great reviews it's getting. Since I've gotten rid of cranium as it is showing it's age (mechanically), I wanted to get more party games that are truly considered great. I got more werewolf style games along with this and dixit. Once I try telestrations out, I'm hoping it will really fill in the void left by cranium (as far as fun and accessibility even though they play very differently)

UPDATE
Amazingly fun party game but you really need the full 8 people or at least 6. I really recommend this for a large group of non gamers to relax and open up with.

Great party game. It has been a blast with every group I have played with so far. Need at least 6 for this game, in my opinion.

Sounds stupid at first, but holy crap do I enjoy this game. Sometimes words flop and you get a super easy to drawn/understand item, but sometimes you get really difficult ones that you only have 60 seconds to draw. That's when the hilarity kicks in. The worse the drawer, the more hilarious the result.

I loath most party games, but this is one that's essential to my collection. Simple, fun and the most hilarious game I own. Add in drinks to make this game over the top.

Great party game. The points don't matter at all, just seeing how the chains of pictures and descriptions warped over the rounds is hilarious.

Telephone was probably the most fun game I ever learned in elementary school and pictionary is just an all around classic. Combine those with an inappropriate adult mind, poor drawing skills and maybe even a little booze and you have one of the best party games of all times. Only in this game could a cast become a penis pump and a muscle car become a race car joint.

I love this game.  It is great to play one round of this just to start off a party game night.  I have yet to play with scoring and find that everyone feels like a winner when we each read off was our notepad at the end of the game.

You can get extremely creative answers with this game. You'll always get people complaining that they can't draw though. That's kind of the point. It's a unique concept that I like a lot. To make it more interesting, play the game with the Cards Against Humanity cards.

The more vague your descriptions the less fun you have. If you get really detailed in your description this game gets incredibly funny. Everyone can draw/guess car that's not fun try guessing 1976 pontiac sunfire and watch people scratch there heads.

RATING: N/A
a very good improvement on 'telephone'.  Also, the dry erase boards are nice, so it actually has some marginal benefit over doing it yourself.

My biggest complains is that too many of the words are too easy, making for boring rounds.  So, it's probably best to let people make up their own starting words, and completely ignore the deck of cards.

--Sep2012-- As silly party activities go, this one is very amusing.  Probably ideal for the crowd for which _Dixit_ is too gamy.  I hope this will become an occasional staple.  (Comment duplicated from essentially-identical Telestrations entry.)

Good light party game for large groups. Some "clues" are more prone to funny difficulties than others.

In the right situation this is always fun. And isn't that what we're all here for?

The more people the better which can be hard to organise. If I can work out what to say to get the group to pick great initial words, this will go to 10.

My personal favorite party game. Through you should just throw out the cards that come with the game and use your own ideas. So much better that way.
Only issues I ever had were with people that aren't creative or actively trying to ruin things.

A great game that is always a lot of fun, but I'll never play this with 12 players. I just downgraded to the 8-player version that also takes up less shelf space.

Telestrations commercializes the game of "telephone pictionary" or "eat poop you cat."  However, the dry-erase markers and reusable pads are a huge plus.  I recently played this using Cards Against Humanity answer cards.  I don't think I've laughed that hard in a really long time.

Excellent party game, definitely in my Top 3.  The concept is genius and lends itself to a ton of laughs.  The flipping whiteboards in this makes the purchase a necessity.  x12!

This game is just plain funny. I've never gone away from a game of this without a huge smile on my face. Sure, you can play with just pen and paper, but the dry-erase pads are worth every penny.

This game is a great party game, and even though I have only played it once, I look forward to playing it more.  The game also has a fun variant called "Telestrations Against Humanity".  Figure it out.

Such silly fun! Honestly it's a bit more of a group activity than it is a game, but who cares?! It's always great to see each other's interpretations and how wildly friends can get perfect pictures wrong. Long live Battle Snail!(which I think was supposed to be a tank?)

Nothing brings out the laughs more than this game. Write a sentence, then the next player draws it, then the next player only sees the drawing and writes down a description of it, then the next player draws THAT description, etc.  We wait till we're all done, then present one at a time and everyone just loses it.

Same as my review of the base Telestrations

"Fun party game, especially when not worrying about keeping score. Just draw, guess, and laugh at the progression. 

Telestrations takes the old "telephone" game where one person starts with an idea, and it gets passed down the line. At the end of the game everyone looks back, and sees where there topic went. On a recent play Rock Musicians turned into an Indian raid. You have to play the game to understand it."

This ramps up the fun to be played with 12 people. It is really great.

The game of telephone but instead of whispers instead it is people laughing so hard they cry. If you are a bad artist like me, this is a great game to have/play as bad art is the whole point of trying to guessing a phrase from an sketch and visa-versa (or at least for me).

RATING: 10
The fact that EVERY time this gets pulled out, someone in the room laughs so hard they can't breathe makes this the best game for any party. 

Some people replace the built-in cards with "Cards Against Humanity" cards.  There's no need for that with the right group.

This is a game where the points don't matter, everyone is really a winner.

Not much to say here, really.  It's simple and funny.  Not really a game, but that doesn't make it any less worth your time.  I've played it sober, drunk, at fancy dinners, casual gatherings, with older and younger people - we always laugh.  
Just make sure you get the 12 player version.  Cause, really, the game shouldn't be played with less than 6, and even the upper limit of 8 can limit when you'll actually WANT to take this one out.  with a full compliment of 12 players, you will have some of the funniest "WTF was THAT?!" moments.

LIKE: Lots of tension. I liked the catchup mechanics for the other stocks, they didn't seem to lag behind too far until the end. Being able to take a extreme chance on a rising stock was interesting. 

DISLIKE: The game feels unbalanced and random because of the bag draw. A good draw of a +1 or -1 is a massive advantage. Early losses makes it difficult to catch back up, since it gets too expensive to buy the front-runner stocks.

OVERALL: The game is fun but excessive random advantages really can spoil effort you've tried to manage on weaker stocks.

The title of the game says it all:  if you try to win this game, it is speculative that you will win.  You might.  You might not.  You can try to mitigate you chances of losing, and improve your chances of winning, but in the end, it is quite likely to be up to the drawing of chits.  If the chits are drawn one way, you win.  If the chits are drawn a different way, you lose.  

I am not sure if it is worth spending an hour playing a game, trying always to do the right thing, with lots of different buying and selling decision, and card playing moves, then effectively "roll a dice" (actually here, you and others draw chits with numbers on them), and have the game outcome decided with THAT event.  So, If you draw a chit with a certain number on it, you win.  If you draw a chit with a different number on it, you lose.   

What did you expect?  The name of the game is Speculation.  Monopoly anyone?  Heck, Monopoly IS a bestseller.  I guess buying property, building houses and hotels, charging rent to other players, all in an effort to bankrupt them, the whole story effectively decided by dice rolls, is more fun than buying and selling stocks, effectively decided by chit pulls.

I really like Henn&#039;s take on the stock market game.  What&#039;s cool is that you think you want the bottom basement stocks because they&#039;re so cheap, but, unlike a LOT of other stock market games, the low-end stocks rarely jump up and pay off... but they CAN.  In other words, they&#039;re actually risky - and genuinely so, not artificially risky - which is great.  And the high-end stuff, sort of like the real market, is usually a good investment... but often won&#039;t pay off that big.  Add to that the whole second-guessing, card playing, die rolling element... did I mention that I like this game?

Edit: 3rd play - back to my original view that getting a big payoff in the early stages is a game-winning opportunity - and conversely, it is very easy to get stuffed through no fault of your own (or anyone else).

Edit:  Second play, and this has re-inforced my view that this is a pretty random game.  The cards that wipe out movement are very difficult to predict.

Only one play.  Good game, but I'm not really sure how much a healthy dose of luck in the early stages can influence the end result.  And is it really possible to predict which shares are going to rocket up and which are going to languish in obscurity?  Happy to play again,  and perhaps my rating will improve.

Speculation is a streamlined and elegant design in the genre I name "Buy Low, Sell High".

There are 8 companies competing on the stock market (symbolized by a continuous line, with "sections" going up or down). Each company has three shares.
Also, each player has a hand of 9 cards (one for each company, plus a special "bank holiday" card). Everybody has always 2 cards in hand.

During each turn, a players draws two tiles from two different bags: one is about the action he can do (moving up or down a company, nothing, or everybody can trade), the other is the amount of spaces a company will go up in the second step of the turn).

If trading is possible (there's 3 trading tiles out of six in the bag, so it's quite often), each player in turn order may sell a share and buy a share. Then (even if another action tile was drawn), everybody secretly and contemporarily plays a card and for each card the corresponding company is moved forward on the track.

Overall, the game is challenging and has some merits, but I don't think it can distinguish itself among today's games...

Speculation is an economic game in which players are trying to make the most money in the stock market by, you could probably guess, speculating on the future value of shares in different companies.  Frequent players of other titles published by Queen Games will recognize that all of the stock names in Speculation (2013 edition) are taken from other games e.g. Shogun, Eketorp, Alhambra, Metro, etc.

A player's turn will consist of determining both the potential movement of stocks along the value track, as well as the action available to players.  In the base game, this is done by drawing tiles from two different cloth bags; although, one of the Queenie expansions provides 6-sided dice that substitute well for the bags of tiles and expedite gameplay.  Typically, players will have the option to buy and/or sell stocks, whose value is determined by both their relative rank on the value track as well as their progress on the value track.  Shares of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place stocks will be worth more than those of the 6th, 7th, and 8th place stocks.  The discrepancy in value grows larger as the stocks progress along the value track throughout the game, with the higher ranked stocks becoming more valuable and the lower ranked stocks eventually taking on negative values.  The first player will periodically also be able to modify the rank of one of the eight stocks up or down one position, which can have significant consequences to owners of the stocks that switch rank.  Every turn, all players will get to play one of two stock cards in their hand to move that particular stock the number of spaces determined by the movement number revealed at the beginning of the round.  However, once played, these cards go into a discard pile and might not be available for a number of rounds before they are shuffled back into each player's deck.

While this game may not appeal to hardcore gamers looking for traditional euro-style mechanics and gameplay, it does offer an enjoyable light-medium gaming experience and substantial amounts of strategy to players.  Decisions as to when you should buy and sell stocks, or which stocks to bump up or down ranks, are complicated by the fact that other players may also possess similar combinations of shares of stocks, and at times may equally benefit from actions you would prefer only benefited yourself.  Skillful decisions must be made to not only distinguish yourself from other players, but to also finish the game with the most valuable set of shares and cash on hand.

Fun for 20 minutes, but the game is way too long for what it is. This is the rare case of a game in which the fewer the players, the longer the game, so I'd recommend never playing this with just three. The score track should really be rescaled for fewer players.

The other problem I have is that this is just too chaotic of a game to be meaningfully strategic. Yes, you try to buy low and sell high (and occasionally you break that rule if you have some "insider knowledge" about a stock). But ultimately, between the draw of your cards, and the draws from the bag, it's just random. And the "Bank Holiday" cards are really, really annoying.

I like stock market games by default, so I was predisposed to liking Speculation and really looked forward to playing it.  While I liked it, I'm still a bit disappointed by it, however.

I can't help but think the way cards are managed could be handled differently to make a much better game.  As is, the flow is really odd.  Each turn, players will play one card, and each player has the exact same deck of cards. So, the first turn of the game, you have no idea what people will play, and then you know more and more which cards have already been played in later rounds until the decks are finally reshuffled and you're back to having no idea again.

This just seemed really odd.  It feels like each player should always have his last 4-5 plays in front of him, with the rest of the cards shuffled, so you always have some idea of what people are capable of doing but not perfect info.

Other than the weird way the game dictates card management, the rest of the game is actually pretty interesting.  With a bit more development, the game could really shine.

However, even with the flaws, it's still a stock market game, which means I still find it fairly enjoyable!

I'm finding that I'm trying to add more games to my collection that work well with new gamers. It's not necessarily gateway games, but "next step" games that seem to enter my collection.

Speculation is a fantastic addition in this slot. It's a relatively straightforward stock/share game with streamlined rules and limited choices. Draw some tiles, make a buy/sell decision, and then play one of two cards to move the share prices. Repeat.

I played a five player game with all new folks, and everyone seemed to enjoy it. The game does seem to work best with 5 or 6. It's a bit random, you need luck on your side, but that's OK given the best audience for this game.

Quick observation--I'm glad I picked up the additional movement action tiles. You can speed the game up a bit by switching in some higher movement numbers. That makes it possible to get in a game during a lunch hour at work. :)

Update: I like the game, but not enough to own it. We played it a handful of times with the lunch crew, and no one was willing to champion it to get it to the table. I'm hoping Stockpile does a similar thing with more of a fun factor.

Like an inverse Manila, this game has open shares and hidden ability to affect shares. Overall, I felt that the randomness of dice was not so much a problem (although when and how often you roll the +1) is pretty critical, but the randomness of the cards most certainly was. I wonder if you tweaked it a bit a la Hab und Gut, making other people's hands partially open and expanding the hand size might make the game a bit less random. As it was, though, I was underwhelmed. For luck-drenched shareholding I'll take Manila or Goldbrau every time.

Spekulation is an old Dirk Henn game that has, shall we say, charming production. The art is hand-made, the board is literally laminate paper on cardboard. I love this kind of stuff.

The concept of the game is pretty simple. There are 8 companies. Each has 3 stocks. Each player has a deck of "cards" featuring 1 instance of each company and one "nothing happens" card. The board has 60 spaces which is broken into 6 tiers of 10 spaces each. Each tier has a different price scheme listed paying out progressively more for high ranks. Each turn, a player rolls the bones which are a standard 6 sided die and one die which has 3 "Buy/Sell Phase" sides, 1 blank side, 1 side which allows you to move a company up a full rank, and 1 side that allows you to move a company down a full rank. After rolling, the player executes the special action. In the case of the Buy/Sell phase, everyone gets to do it in order, either buying or selling one share at current market price. Everyone then simultaneously chooses 1 card from their hand of 2, reveals, and the companies chits move up that number of spaces on the board, leap-frogging other chips without spending movement. The game ends when a company hits 61, at that point the current value of the stocks in hand are tallied along with cash, most wins.

The game is cute. The basic idea is to invest in stocks for companies that have an opportunity to move up rapidly, either because you have a card in your hand or because you notice that the table hasn't played many of them. You then try to wring money out of them once they've gained a rank or two. The main thing you're trying to avoid is investing in companies that no one else is interested in (because they'll tend to move that company when the die rolls are low) and being stuck with shares in the company in last place at the end of the game (a big -60 kick in the knickers per share).

The main quibble I have is that there is close to zero control of the proceedings. The best strategy I can see is trying to piggy back with other players so you know that someone else is trying to help you out. The "nothing happens" market cards can throw everything for a decided loop though, and because card selection is blind, simultaneous reveal, you can easily screw up a market move that would benefit you or be screwed by the same. I also wonder about the early game. It seems like it's easy to be humped at that point. Having early game liquidity is key because being able to sell an early stock for a decent return will mean you can buy yet more shares and keep the gravy train rolling. Players who can't get that early cash injection seem like they are in tough the rest of the way. All of this said, it's a decent diversion, and not long enough to really bother me all that much, but it's not particularly great either, and I don't think there's going to be anything new to see here the second time around, which is pretty much my textbook 4.

Warning! my rating is based on one game and I absolutely got destroyed. There seems to be a great deal of luck and what tactics are required are dead simple. Even the winners agreed with this but of course they had more fun. I'll give it a 5 in faith that its probably very unlikely to get into such a locked out position very often. I sat through 3/4 of the game and had to pass every time due to lack of funds.

I felt like there's a great game here with these exact components, but a different rulebook.  Not enough flexibility with your hand and in general, just too much randomness for a game like this.

RATING: 6
I’ve had one 4P play of the game that I enjoyed much more than I expected. In fact, in one sense Speculation rendered the best speculative stock experience I’ve ever seen; brilliant relational mechanism. The question is whether or not there’s enough control here over the proceedings. I can’t say for certain after one play but my guess is that the answer changes based on how many people are playing. 

The brilliant mechanism is that stock prices are two dimensional. That is, they aren’t fixed just based on their position in the market but also on their relational position to each other from top 1 to lowly 8. There are different tracks in the game and stock markers move through these tracks as the game progresses. So a #3 stock on one track is worth more than a #2 on the previous track. Moreover, lower stocks will start to be worth less as the game goes on (even to the point of being negative!). 

This means that you truly need to speculate on which stocks to buy now before they move to a new track and jump up in price (or get pushed down from where they currently are). Managing the stocks becomes a game of leap-frog where you want to time your leaps best. You have a two-card hand of cards and each turn play one to move a stock up in the market – unless someone plays their one “cancel” card, that is. 

Now comes the weaker part of the game – managing the leap-frog game. Let’s say you increase a stock you own from $95 to $175. Now you sell and pocket the increase, right? Not exactly. The “sell” action chit has to be drawn from the bag. If not, you have to wait till a future round. By then, your stock might be worth $100. You didn’t hold onto it because you were too stupid but only because you didn’t have the opportunity to sell it. 

So the ostensible fun is a game where you need to buy low and sell high but your control is seriously hampered by when the sell action chit will be pulled and by a two-card hand each turn. That’s a big dose of uncertainty and luck in the game and is the part I’m unsure about after one play. I did like the game well enough (and I didn’t win) to look forward to another play.

Maybe it was just the game we played (no trades for the first 5 or 6 die rolls) but my first play of this seemed like a game in which you had little control over your fate.

My second play was with the new Queen edition, which changes the rules so that trades will come up at least once every four turns.  This is a better game.

Probably the best 6+ player game in my collection. Having the extra action mini expansion and the 7-8 players is a must.

The theme is a stock market game but it's really a race and betting game at its core. The simplicity, along with the "controlled chaos" in this game is just amazing. What I mean is that you always have some choices to make when it comes to which stocks to boost and when but everyone is trying to do the same which just turns it into a crazy game.

You almost always have a chance at this game, the ending is very intense

This game is just brilliant. Money is always very tight, so you're forced to sell higher ranked shares to buy other lower shares. This cashflow management aspect is quite unique coz despite its stock trading nature, this game doesn't do payouts for holding certain shares. All in-game cash comes solely from sale of shares. Timing of when to sell shares is also important since later stock movements are more volatile in value and prices drop more rapidly. Be warned though, gameplay can drag on longer than expected if stock movements tiles drawn are low valued throughout the game. A session of Speculation can go anywhere between 45 mins to 2 hrs.

Not really my cup of tea.  It feels like it should be a game of signalling and joint ventures, but the ability to play only one of two cards on a turn, the number of vetoes, and the randomness of who gets a free push of a stock turn this into something with too much chaos (and card counting) for my taste.  And the repetitiveness of the buy/sell had me looking at my watch quite a bit.

RATING: 7
Queen Games reviving a Dirk Henn design from 1992! Speculation seems to be a game that folks who don't typically like stock manipulation games enjoy. I think this is because this is more of a racing and betting game than a stock game. It is one single track with stocks literally racing to a finish line! There are a number of legs in the race where the valuation of a stock will either rise if the stock is in front or sink further if in the rear. Buying and selling stocks are limited to one sale and one buy each turn, but only if the right tile is drawn. Some turns you have to let it ride. Your choices of stocks to manipulate are limited by a hand of only two cards.

This is a game in which to win you need to anticipate and ride the coattails of others as much as possible. If a lot of players are buying a stock, it is often good to jump on the bandwagon if you can, even if you have no control over the behavior of that stock. You can hold long for stocks that are consistently in the lead and buy and sell quickly as stocks cross over to a new leg of the race and jump in value. By keeping track of which cards have been played, you can anticipate which stocks have some movement left in them, but you don't know how much until the tiles are drawn.

Fun chaotic game of share speculation.  It's a little bit like a horse race game where you can bet on and sell your bets as the race proceeds.  There is a blind action phase where players move the "horses" and opportunities for screwage.

It's a good game for 5-6, and the expansion takes it to 8 - the sort of game that can get people shouting at the table.

RATING: 7
Another rare case of a functioning and fun stock market game. Really simple - execute the drawn action (with at least 50% chance it's the trade action), simultaneously play cards to influence selected stocks by the drawn number of movement steps, done. Temporary alliances through co-ownership, double-guessing players' stock selections and timing investment/divestment decisions make the game. The amount of luck is appropriate for the game length of 45 minutes.

Better than Stockpile as it stays closer to the basic 'buy low-sell high' without introducing multiple subsystems. The downside is the repetitive nature of turns that will bother some. Playable already with three but better with more. The loss of control is overcompensated by improved group dynamics and hopefully enough trashtalk with the right group.

I have to admit, I was very disappointed. I had wanted a copy of the db version of Spekulation for a long time, so I was happy that it got a reprint. But in practice, it is a little tedious, and in general the gains and losses in stocks are minor, making for an experience that is a bit lacking in excitement.

I've been interested in Speculation for quite some time until I managed to get a used copy for cheap. Took me even more time to get it played. But I really like it. Getting it played is tough though. Ever tried to pitch a stock market game? It's really not easy. But as unlikely as it sounds, the game is a hoot when you've got enough players (5-6). It's a crazy, random rollercoaster of ups and downs, highs and lows. But I always have a blast.

speculation is a tough game to rate. i have the feeling that turnorder might be too important as most stocks stayed close together. on the other hand you should be aware of that. but than again they should too. couple movement with dicerolls and there is probably too much luck in there as well.

had a good time playing it though. rating is more likely to drop with more plays though.

One of the best stock-market games I've ever played (first time was maybe ~2006). A bit luck-driven, but still offers interesting decisions to make. I tried to find the first edition from Essen in 2007-2009, but didn't have any luck. Luckily Queen made the new edition which looks great and with all the mini-expansions offers nice variety. Just great game, smooth gameplay!

Played once, 5p.  Another "mechanism wrapped in a game" game, with just a tiny bit more going on with the random nature of which stocks are available for you to manipulate each turn.  Really, this game is at least 25% too long.  If it could be brought down to slightly-longer-filler length, it would get a pip up.

RATING: 7
I found this to be a short, enjoyable romp through a stock market simulation.  Die rolls control whether trading actually occurs where one can only either buy OR sell ONE stock based on there position relative to the other 7 companies and the color chart where their stock is located.  If trading does not occur, a stock will change position or nothing will happen.  As well, everyone has a chance to play a "drafted" card relative to a stock to move it up a certain number of spots.  

The Queen edition is nicely produced with a few more interesting variants added to the game, including a double sided board with one side a bit more challenging.  Action chits are also now used instead of dice to determine the action for the turn and there are several different options for action chits to be used in a game.

Liked this a lot.  Might be better with 4 than 3 - I'd have to play more. But a lot of fun. Different take on stock market games than Acquire or Airlines.

Update: I've played Speculation 5 or 6 times now, and have a similar number of plays of Stockpile. I really enjoy both as different takes on stock market games.  I'm surprised by the complaints that Speculation is boring or random.  Yes, the game has random elements, but in my experience, if you are stuck with low performing stocks all game that has more to do with poor play than randomness. By design the game encourages players to utilize their insider information (their cards) and their perceptions of what other players have.  Failure to do that will lead to losing...which makes sense.

Great stock manipulation game.  It can appear very lucky at first, and there is a fair amount of luck, but for some reason you feel like there's just enough control to make smart moves.  In the end, you're playing the players more than you're playing the game.

It plays a broad number of players and scales well.  It always plays quickly and the rule set is very light.  I think this one is under appreciated.  Stockpile got a lot of praise when it came out (rightly so), but this game was there first and still demands attention.

Ok buying/selling game with a lot of randomness.  You have some chances to make decisions, but unless you have a very good memory of who has played what, they don't help you very much.

Very light stock market game, mostly luck dependent, but with a bit of memory and second guessing too. 

The production is not bad, but the board is too dark and unappealing, and the tokens should have been replaced by a dice.

It features simultaneous action and accommodates 5-6 players perfectly (in fact, it's where it shines most). Players have very few actions available every round.

It's a nice game to play in a light mood. Its only issue [and not a minor one] is its length: you get bored of doing the same over and over.

RATING: 7
Watching stock rise and fall in price and trying to make the most out of a cheap stock is satisfying. Trying to dump cheap stock and realizing you just pissed away $50 bucks on something that "had potential" is awesome. Game is luck based, but I honestly think that skill is most definitely involved. I do worry that the game might drag a bit, especially if people are playing the "stop" cards, one after the other, which has happened. We had one game go twice as long because nobody played them together and half the turns involved nothing changing. Debating on using the 5-6 player rules regardless of player count to help alleviate that problem.

I prefer Rolling Stock to this game, but that's like saying I like 18xx over Ticket to Ride. Great gateway game that's still interesting for gamers.

Edit: Fucked up one minor rule and one sort of major rule. I didn't realize tiles ignored occupied spaces and still counted those spots for movement. The tiles were much slower to progress in the game and sort of bunched up together. That should alleviate my concern that the game went on for a little longer than I wanted. The minor rule we fucked up was that you have to play all 9 cards before you shuffle/redraw. The only rule I'm not entirely sure on is after the first tile "draw" being a handshake, do you shuffle and draw new tiles or do you go until you hit a second handshake? Not that it makes THAT big of a difference, but since you didn't "draw" it initially, not sure if you shuffle right away.

Includes: Expansion 1 - Special action tiles.

If you wanna have a chance at winning this game, you have to obey 2 laws:

1) Like in real life when dealing with stock: buy low, sell high
2) Control your greed: if you've bought a share at rank 6, 7 or 8, it's better to cash in as it reaches rank 2 or 3, as you will have made a nice profit and the potential of going higher comes with a big risk of going down again. 

If you wanna play this game, you have to be very opportunistic. If that's nothing for you, then this game is probably nothing for you. Shares can go up fast, but also go down very fast, nothing's for sure in this game and you have to make the best of the situation when you can trade.

Update: Intended as an easy and fun intro to stocks and shares, alas as 3 players is minimum makes getting to the table difficult, while I still have Black Friday which appeals more. Also the Queen product placement for share names wasn't appealing either.

Seemingly simple turns followed by simultaneous reveal which can produce some drama, the attraction could be can the bull and bear be tamed, as tracking is possible.
However, maybe having a two card hand is too limiting.

From a dummy runthrough, reminds me of Montgolfiere with the simultaneous card play and reveal, with cards to either cancel out movement etc, with some card counting to time when to play the best card.

Maybe best with 3-4 to ease tracking memory plus without the fiddleness of 5-6 player bank holiday resolution.

Speculation
Talk about a game were if you back the wrong horse - you are out of contention. 
The basic idea is to invest in stocks that may shoot up the track. Using a combination of what you play and what you've watched the table. Once they advanced a couple of rungs cash in and repeat with another stock. With all the players scrambling the same way there is a lot of chaos and little control. 
If you get caught in a liquidity trap, your stocks don't advance you are pretty much hosed and you might as well go through the motions. Also if any stock gets left behind it generally stays that way.

This is a fun game that has a lot in common with racing games in that you are rooting for different stocks to rise throughout the game.  Gets only a 7 because the Bank Holiday and the Hourglass keep things from happening - which is not only annoying, but slows down the game.  A fun game nevertheless.

I was surprised by this one.  I played it originally 2 years ago, and when I first saw it, the production value kind of turned me off.  But upon playing it, I completely changed my mind.  Although I'm not a huge fan of stock market games, Spekulation is does an excellent job of distilling the mechanisms of other stock market games (or maybe is the cornerstone of other stock market games, since it was designed so long ago) into a tight, concise game.  There are not that many rules, and the one-less-stock-per-number-of-players rule, really creates tension throughout the game.  Everyone should play this game at least once.

Neat Dirk Henn gem. It's a roll and move stock speculation game that offers a fair amount of tension and decision making.

Don't play this expecting to buy shares rock bottom and sell them high. They won't go that high. Players do well selling for small gains and reinvesting in blue chip shares. Fun.

A tip: sell off your very first share as soon as you get decent money on it. This early cash injection is essential. Also, look at your two cards in hand: these are perhaps cards to buy. Also try to tabletalk and encourage others to buy it (to get their help in pushing the stock up).

When I first saw this game, I didn't expect anything from this. The theme sounded boring and the components looked bland. It's just a track with numbers and 8 pieces of different colors and a 6.8 rating on bgg. This is probably one of the most underrated games, in my opinion. This game is super swingy. You can literally be dead last and through a series of events in your favor, you can be in first place. Thats the appeal of this game. Let me buy the cheapest stock and pray that it somehow will make it to the top and when it does, it gives you that rush of adrenaline that very few board games can produce. It's really weird to say, but this is one of my most favorite games.

I feel strange even rating this game, as I think it is a strong design, with wonderful elegant elements, but it just feels unfinished (and I'm not talking about the graphics).  The breaks on the stocks are fun and when you get decisions they ae simple, but engaging. The problem is that the market eventually reaches a point of near stability, which nicely emulates the market, but doesn't make for an exciting game.  Often those in last place have nothing worthwhile to do through most of the game.  Once the stocks get bought up there often isn't anything to do.  Because the game isn't volitile it can get to a point were no one is interested in selling and the lead stocks are too expensive to buy and aren't a worthwhile investment.

The result is a game that has the potential to be too long with a significant chunk of it leaving little or nothing to do.  Often the game, despite the choppy quick turns tends to drag on. I really would love to see this game finished and reissued.  It seems that in order to speed up the game the blank side of the die should have a +1 (plus I'm not a fan of the "lose your turn" mechanic injected into games), this would inject some vitality into the market and should move all the pieces forward faster.  Really, I would be most interested in playing this game if you had three dice to roll the green which moves the stock up and then two special dice with the option to choose which action to take from the special die.  

This is almost a hidden masterpiece, but really it leaves something to be desired.

I'm disposed to like stock games, and there is some interesting incentive manipulation in this game of buying low and selling high. The value of a stock is determined by its position on a score track relative to other stocks. Manipulating stock prices is done by players simultaneously revealing cards. Cards generally boost the value of a stock, though some cards negate the effects of other cards. A lot depends on lucky timing. With the simultaneous reveal, there's more chaos than I'd like.

RATING: 6
Light stock market game that plays quickly and has a lot of interaction, because players choose from a set deck of stocks which one will be advanced that round (if any) and they are advanced by a certain factor for each one that was played that round.

I wish there was a little more buying and selling opportunities.  I think that would have made me like the game more.

I prefer the older rules with the dice viariant, as opposed to the newer "pulling chits out of a bag" to determine the rounds actions.

A perfectly typical Queen Games game, from before the dark days of Kickstarter (even though this was a KS reprint).

There's a good amount of strategy here and the game simulates a stock market well enough. The luck, from card draws, drawing of action tokens and bank holidays don't quite render the final result meaningless but add enough chaos and luck that the whole family should be able to compete.

I'd like to try the game again with a bigger hand of cards to choose from just to see if the additional planning opportunities pay off.

A really solid design from Dirk Henn which I am glad was dug out from the archives and reprinted by Queen Games. This game ranks higher than Alhambra for me and on par with Show Manager, another of Henn's design.

Folks have claimed this game is a simplified but close simulation of market forces and its chaotic nature in the short run. I fully agree. The design of the segmented stock price index on the board is really intelligent in that stock prices modulate over time with stocks getting more valuable for the leaders on the board, but actually cheaper for the lagging companies. This sets up the potential for buying cheap stocks toward the end game, hoping that they will catch a break and overtake some of the leaders for a respectable showing. While in practice this doesn't always happen, it can and will. A shrewed investor will sell high value stocks to purchase middle of the pack stocks to push these stocks upward while pocketing the difference and building cash reserves to buy the more valuable stocks. This is also one game where card memorization, particularly when bank holidays were played would be highly beneficial. Sure, there were occasions when a bank holiday thwarted a well-planed move and there is luck in the dice roll/chit pull but a very smart and well-designed game indeed!

Two additional comments I would make is that this game should not be played with more than 5. I do not understand why an 8 player expansion was included. The game with four was perfect and with more, will simply increase down time during trade sessions. Cannot imagine that being fun. In addition, I feel that the cards and tiles for the stocks should be swapped. Players handle the cards to choose stock movement all through the game and I feel using the more durable tiles made more sense.

Good game.  Has that nice older Euro feel of a simplistic goal with a bare minimum of mechanics that still leads to a good execution.  It's refreshing, particularly in the newer market of games that all seemingly need to have 5+ different resources and complex VP engines.  This game, by contrast, has a very simplistic valuation mechanism that makes for interesting timing, with just enough luck to make the game replayable.  The game does get a little bit dry, but much of that is because it does mimic the theme, and it's not like stock market trading is the most riveting activity for most people.

This game is ok, but it certainly run too long for what it is. The 'actions' you can do in the game is very limited and become repetitive fast. The principle in the game is to buy low and sell high, but you have so little control over when you can do these actions. Sometimes you hold on to a stock too long, just because the randomness of the game didn't give you an opportunity to sell earlier.

A light "buy low, sell high" sort of game. 

A bit chaotic with six, but it plays well and fast.

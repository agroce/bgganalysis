Very fun game for large groups. Doesn't work well with less than 4 Players.

I love balderdash. It is one of the best party games in my opinion. It is funny without trying to be. It is a blast trying to BS other players with nonsense definitions.

On the one hand, a party game, which isn't really my thing.  And it brings out the show-off in me.  On the other hand, clever for that kind of thing, and I've joined games late and won, which is fun.  Not bad, for what it is.

My favourite party game! Also the only game I play that I never play to win: I just try to come up with the goofiest definitions, without caring whether or not anyone falls for them (although it's hilarious when someone does!). Not a game to be taken seriously, folks; just play it for laughs. Loads of fun!

I really like this bluffing game where players come up with fake definitions for unusual, real words, plots for obscure movies, biographies for little-known figures, the meanings of bizarre acronyms. I also know a few people who hate this game; it's not for everyone, I expect.

(Norwegian edition: Kokkelimonke) My default rating for party games (can't stand them, being glorified quiz books, the board no more than a score track and always require 3 or 4 players minimum). This one's not very bad, but can't remember playing more than the night I got it. Currently uses the boxes for rubik's cubes, gameboys and other random junk.

RATING: 5
The predecessor of 'judging' party games like Apples to Apples et al., but with a trival element. It's okay, but its successors are better for ditching that element to focus on the funnest aspect of that game.

Barnumize, to sequentially molest animals in their stalls.

RATING: 6.5
I don&#039;t own this game actually, but we play Dictionary every time there are 6+ players present. This game goes well with any mood: from the outrageously funny (as in a party game, preferably while drinking), to the bluffingly almost-true (as in a more "serious" game).

UPDATE: Grown out of it. A solid game, and usually fun, but there's tons of better games out there. Down to a 6.5.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
This is great fun when in the right mood and with the right group. The grade can probably vary between 4 and 9, depending on the group of people. This game really helped me through my military service, five or six guys who really thought all the military pennalism stuff sucked sat down to play this every once in a while on free moments. Great way to not need to think of military stupidness for a while.

Will probably trade away for Kablamo, as soon as I get myself a copy of "More Balderdash" or whatever it's called.

RATING: 7
Before I got neck deep in eurogames and ameritrash, our mixed game group spent a lot of time with parlor games, and Balderdash was always near the top of the heap.  Had to be creative, yet logical, and we always were gifted with many belly laughs.  Every so often, it gets pulled out, we have a lot of fun, and I wonder why we don't take it out more often.  Probably will be a perennial favorite for large group party gaming. [Market price]

I have learned to like certain party games. This is one of them. There are not many party games that get played in my normal game groups (Wits and Wagers is definitely the major exception, along with Coyote), but I enjoy playing Balderdash whenever possible, which seems to be at conventions only. Stephen Glenn should be on the list of mandatory components for this game.

I'm not great at making up dictionary definitions, so this game feels like *work*.  Not bad every now and again, though.  

**UPDATE**  The newer 2006 version is very much like Beyond Balderdash, and this is a big improvement over the original Balderdash because the acronyms, people, movies & law categories make the game more interesting and fun.

(This is the newer version with multiple categories: Beyond Balderdash maybe?)

This is an ok party game, that is pretty accesible to most teenagers and up. It does require a bit of creativity to be successful at, but I think it's a game that is enjoyable and can lead to some pretty funny moments.

this has definitely taken a backseat to the Beyond version after getting a chance to come up with movie synopses, why people are famous, and acronyms it's hard to go back to just plain old word definitions alone, still loads of fun being creative and managing to fool others/get fooled, this and beyond will always be a part of my collection

I mostly remember playing [i]Balderdash[/i] at my boss's annual Christmas party.  That was in the 80s.  I remember it being fun.  In this game you have to make up fake definitions for words, and with the right people, it can be super funny.  Even some of the real definitions for the words are hilarious.  I have played it a couple times since then, but I don't often play party games.

RATING: 8
I have the original edition that didn't have all these newfangled categories, just cards with words and definitions.  This is one of my favorite party games (which I define as a casual game for a large group). The larger a group you can get the better the game plays. I usually play it with myself as an nonscoring GM, who always reads the rounds. This works well because I'm the only person I know who can read the round without giving it away (which is important). - Also, this game is sensitive to spoil-sports. It only takes one person who doesn't really want to play the game to make it less fun for everyone else. It is not, therefore, a game for drunk people. :P

Encourages creativity more than Apples to Apples, but not as much fun as a party game.  Going for laughs takes you in the opposite direction than going for points.  Trying to be funny makes it harder to win, and taking it seriously as a game negates the party fun intent.  neither good as a party game or as a word game, but still a fun activity.

RATING: 4
Another one of the few party games I've liked, but this one plays out extremely fast. The key is figuring out that you need to mimic the definitions on the cards; once you've done that, the whole game of coming up with amusing definitions is lost. And even if you stick with playing to come up with  fun definitions, there is a limit as to how far you can go with that.

RATING: 8
I much prefer the Beyond Balderdash version but my in-laws have it so no need to get a copy for myself. This game has made me laugh to the point of stomach pain.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Basically a game of hearing words you've likely never heard of before, and trying to write convincing definitions to them.  If you are convincing enough while also good at deducing the actual definition of the word, you'll do well!

Really requires the right group to be a good game, as the fun factor will depend on the creativity of the group.

Very frustrating when the reader stumbles over my definition because they don't know the words or have trouble with my handwriting. It gives it away that the definition is not the one they wrote down.

Beyond that, I never found the game particularly interesting, always felt it went on too long. Maybe because everyone's definitions try to sound serious, and I like my party games to make me laugh.

Works very well with the right crowd. You can easily play this without the game - just pass round a good sized dictionary and take turns to look for obscure words or select a book from a sizeable library and play 'what's the first/last line of book X?' Wise & Otherwise uses the second halves of little known proverbs which I think would also be fun.

Meh...I don't enjoy word games very much, especially when I play against my wife, who, although she is really good at making up nonsensical words, she is really good at coming up with appropriate words as well.

However, this game plays very well with a correct group of people.  Essentially, witty adults with a very keen sense of humor.  It can be done, and I will play it, but only with a select group of my friends.  Otherwise, I will never suggest it, and very rarely play it.

I really can't stand this game.  Which is too bad, because I will readily admit that, when it comes to party games, Balderdash has a much better design than A2A or CAH.  Unfortunately, I would rather play either of those as it is so much easier to disconnect from the actual game and just enjoy the company of my friends.  Coming up with random definitions/ideas every single round just feels like way too much effort for a party game.

"The Dictionary Game" in a box.  Having fun with this game will depend on playing with the right crowd...which would need to consist of creative people.  I've played lifeless games where the definitions were so obviously not correct, it was easy to pick the right one.  "Wlweboon: a big thing."  Hmmm, I wonder if that is the correct one?!  The best laughs come when all the definitions are so good, no one can guess correctly.  It is a good party type game that makes for an evening of laughs.

This is consistently hilarious. More than any other game I know of this one leads to laughs and raucous fun above all other games i know of. I think this one still has some rules for movement and some other mechanisms, ignore them. Just play the game and ignore the board and pawns, when I play we just count 1 point per vote in the first time around the table and 2 points in the second. A lot of the time games just become everyone trying to make everyone else laugh and forget all about trying to win or tracking points at all. Highly highly recommend.

This game makes me very happy.  I LOVE the creative process of making up very convincing definitions.  I find it hard to find groups of people that are up to the same task.

RATING: 6
Rating as of Sept '14 - 6. Rating unchanged since May '13. This was fun back in the day, but there are better party games now. Gave my copy away to a friend.

Things I enjoy about this game: It's a party game where you don't need friends with inside jokes. Definitions and mundane things can be funny.

Things I don't like about this game: It's too long for what it is. There's a of quiet time while people are writing definitions which is awkward for a party game. Bad handwriting, grammar, and how the definition is phrased can affect the game. Most definitions aren't funny. It can be exhausting coming up with random definitions.

Games we'd rather play than this: Telestration is the party game of choice hands down. As for trivia game, I probably want to play Wits and Wagers instead. Catch Phrase is also fun. For coming up with something creative, I like Dixit more.

A game where you write definitions about a word and try to get people to guess your own. It's kind of like a really long joke due to sitting around a writing definitions and sometimes it turns out to not really be a joke but a couple of time a game, there ends up being something hilarious. The game isn't very good but it sticks around and keeps getting produced as a mass market game because of the laughter that can ensue.

[Party Game, Creative] [6P:6] Nice party game for creative people. Making up answers isn't easy for everyone, and the game may drag if a player or two struggle to come up with answers at the spur of the moment. With the right crowd, it's a pleasing party game that can elicit laugh-out-loud moments. Sometimes, the most absurd answers can be the most plausible...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
One of my favorite party games that can be played with just about any number of people.  Buying the actual game helps with the identification of some crazy words to define, but it can be played just using a good dictionary as well.  One of the more consistent laugh-inducers, regardless of the type of crowd.  It usually degenerates into an experience where most people are trying to get laughs more than they are trying to get points, but if games are all about having fun, this one delivers.

Fun little game, but playing with the wrong people makes it far too easy.  For example, if someone has a tendency to phrase their definitions the same, it doesn't take long to pick theirs out of the line-up.

Ditto for someone who zeroes in on a particular kind of definition...after a couple of them, you can pick out theirs, too.

Still, it's great to bone up on your BS skills.  I wouldn't play this all the time but I'd gladly sit down for a game with friends, and it's enjoyable in that situation.

More of an excuse to sit around and laugh over nonsense than anything else. I'd rather actually talk (and laugh) about something more interesting than very obscure words, people, acronyms, movies, and laws. The art seems to be in coming up with something so crazy and just detailed enough to fool others, while voting for the one you think can't possibly be real - it will be (reality is almost always more bizarre than anything your friends will come up with). Can have an insanely (and inanely) long playing time (we took 3+ hours when played with 9 people; it didn't help that the leader went to bed about 2/3 into the game).

This is not a boardgame, it is a party game.

Party game of coming up with creative word definitions and so forth, while guessing other peoples' definitions.  I'm not much for creating definitions or for guessing.  I think Balderdash is not my game in the same way that Dixit is not my game, but to a lesser degree.

RATING: 6
This is one of the better party games for me and my group of friends.  The &quot;6&quot; is largly because we only play party games about once/year.  It is also imperitive that you have a group that is good at mimicking the style of writing of a collegiate dictionary, or the correct answer becomes wicked obvious.  And if one or two players have a distinctive style, or just a bizarre way of bluffing, they will be very frustrated by their lack of success.

I always find it interesting to try to vary my definitions, between serious and humorous, noun and verb, to prevent everyone from knowing it's mine.

An obscure vocabulary game. Half board game/half creative outlet of sorts. A good chunk of the game is just trying to come up with something believable, but outrageous when it comes to the word in question. The other part is just guessing from the zany choices.

A fun game to play with people who enjoy making up information and then bluffing about it, while trying to guess what the real odd answer is.

I'm not sure if we played this yet or not. We saw it cheap at a thrift store and remembered it seemed like a popular game so we got it. The thing is now that I remember that I generally dislike coming up with things off the top of my head and that I'm an absolutely awful bluffer, I doubt I'll like it if we ever do play it again.

See my malarky comments, however, maybe I will like it. I doubt it though because you're making up bluff definitions to words instead of to strange perplexing questions.

Balderdash contains several cards with real words nobody's heard of. After one of those words has been read aloud, players try to come up with definitions that at least sound plausible, because points are later awarded for every opposing player who guessed that your definition was the correct one.

Definetely worth playing.

RATING: 8
Pretty good oldie game.  This is the one game I got through my wife.

We now have the new version which has laws and initials and movie plots (my favorite).  That made this into my favorite party game.

It's fairly interesting because all the words are real words/movies/laws/initials/people (so you actually learn something sometimes), and you're making up definitions with them.  I like that there is a bit of actual strategy to it: if you're the dasher, the way you say the definitions can really influence people.  And (if you play with the rule that the dasher gets to pick which word it is), you can pick words tailored to your audience, because the definition is likely to have everyone think that someone else there made that up, and no one guesses it, and you get your bonus points.  I really enjoyed doing that.

Of course, as with most party games, you really don't need to do the scoring.  Also, there's a lot of laughter.  And there's a fair amount of quiet time of people just writing and thinking which is interesting for a party game.  But that doesn't make this a bad game at all.

Artwork and pieces are drab; that's literally the only thing I can think of that is bad.

In junior high we played this one in class, simply calling it "Dictionary Game" This 'official' version takes the game a few steps further. My family really enjoys it since you can easily play with folks sitting comfortable in a living room, rather then everyone needing to be upright at a game table. Its a clever game of making up definitions to real words, trying to guess the right meaning while bluffing your friends. My family is very creative with it and everyone aged 11-65 enjoys it.

A classic party game that holds its own against more recent releases, and finds its way onto the table fairly regularly. It's also family-friendly, and develops a light but pleasing metagame over the course of play (one of my favorite aspects of most party games).

I've found that Balderdash just doesn't gel with some groups -- but when it works, it works well.

---

I haven't played this in ages, but I hold onto it because I can foresee situations when it will be handy to have -- and it's pretty fun.

Another party game what more can I really say?  This is one of my least favorite by far though.

In original Balderdash you are trying to come up with the definition for a word.  Of course the cards have obscure words that people are unlikely to know.  The current player draws a card, reads the word, and then the other players write down what they think the definition is.  You want to write down the correct definition, because you get bonus points, but this doesn't happen often so really the main objective is to write down something believable enough to get people to vote for yours.  The current player will write down the actual definition.  After everybody is done and has handed their papers to the current player, he/she will mix them up and read off the definitions to everybody.  Then all the players vote for which one they think is right and you score points for voting on the correct answer, or for people voting on yours.

Newer additions have added more than just definitions.  The version we have has laughable laws, so it will say the first phrase from a law somewhere and you write how it finishes.  Acronyms, pretty self explanatory.  Movie plots, you get a title of a movie and have to give the plot.  Lastly it has people, so you are given a random name and you have to give a fact about that person.

I think the biggest reason I dislike this game is because I am not creative enough to come up with good answers.  Also, it always seems like there is that one person who has really good answers and I always pick theirs.  Needless to say I rarely score very many points, and the stress of having to think of my own answer just isn't worth it.  The best part about this game for me, is when it's my turn because I don't have to do much.

Here's a great idea for a game.  Ya ready?  Okay.  You're given a long, obscure word that no one has ever heard of.  Then...you write a fake definition for it.  Finally, everyone tries to guess who wrote which crap!  Wow...I get to sit around for an hour writing out definitions?  Isn't that what my teachers in gradeschool punished us with for misbehaving?

and from my brother in law:
Kermes - "The native language of Kermit the Frog."

There are only a few games I can get my dad to play: Pit, Trivial Pursuit, Chess and Balderdash. He's a pretty serious, stoic guy, so we knew we had a winner for a game in Balderdash when he was reduced to tears while laughing so hard during a read. Of course, at least 2-4 times during the game, he knows the word definition straight up.

A game that rewards creativity and cleverness and usually produces much hilarity.

Can be a cool game, if in the mood.  Not as "enlightening" for the vocabulary as it might seem -- the words are largely obscure not useful to build one's vocabulary.  The game degenerates to a "bluffing" game a lot more than it is a test of wits and knowledge (or even being able to make estimated guesses from root words).  Can be fun, but can also be frustrating.

RATING: 8
Balderdash's rating from me would score somewhere between a 4 and a 10. It absolutely depends on who you play it with and how creative you're feeling. I genuinely haven't laughed as hard at any game in my life as I have with Balderdash; and that includes multiple occasions. The best part is is that all the humour comes from the players. Rather than spoonfeeding jokes to players like Cards Against Humanity or Choking Hazard, Balderdash just creates a brilliant framework for players to use to create their own jokes - and it works brilliantly. Don't get me wrong, the game definitely works better after a couple of beers to loosen you up, but once you're going it genuinely has the potential to be one of the best games out there, where people have to create their own word definitions, acronyms, laws and other ridiculous topics and bluff other players in to thinking that they're true. It's possible to play to win Balderdash - giving simple (read boring) answers which are wholly plausible. But everyone's favourite player will be the one who comes up with a totally unbelievable pitch that'll have everyone laughing.

Really depends on whether the people you play with are creative and have facility with language. When that's the case it can be very funny, especially when the reader can't keep a straight face. (Therefore, depending on who's playing, I could rate this between a 6 and an 8.) I think the track is a little long for what this is, but that's a minor criticism, as our family usually agrees before playing how far along the track we'll go for the victory point.

Sometimes you just need a good Party Game. Something that will induce laughter in all who play. That game is Balderdash. It's incredibly easy to learn and play, so anyone can participate. Because "jokes" are written down there is no danger of shyness preventing people from letting loose. I haven't played the game in years, but see the box and think of the awesome times I had.

It's understandable that party games are underrated on this website, as this site is for German-type games, but I think this game is definitely underappreciated.  True, it takes a creative and/or dastardly group to play, but definitely an amazing and entertaining experience with the right players.

A great game for a pile of creative people and is a good choice for a party where everyone gets involved.  I've never once used the board, though.  We've always just scored a few rounds and then counted up the scores when we're finished. Meh, we made our own fun with it and I've always enjoyed it when it comes out.. (which is rare).  If you can't have fun with this game, it is likely to be because you get all bent out of shape when you don't win and lack creativity and/or imagination, you're also likely to be a sad individual with no friends and prefer bookkeeping and the occaisional suduko.  Yeah, I said it.  Lighten up.

When do I play this?:
Usually right after a meal with family and we're all feeling the effects of the wine.  My family is a cerebral bunch, but also quite rudely comical, so we have a heck of a lot of fun with this one.

This game was the most fun when using the category of acronyms.  The other categories were not as fun.

A silly, fun party game. It takes some creativity, which some players don't like, but for people who like it this is a fast and funny party game. There is a scoring system, but the game can quickly devolve into players just writing down options that sound funny rather than trying to score points.

My favorite party game... with the right crowd, it can be hours of fun... one person (the dasher) reads the obscure word from a card then writes down the real definition, all the other players write down their own definitions... the dasher reads all the answers in random order, and players vote for the one they think is right... you move forward for getting the right answer, but it's even better if others pick your definition... still save all the definitions from previous games...

Rating / comments are for the original parlour game, 'Dictionary'.

A good (non-trivia!) party game which works best when the group has similar vocabularies and senses of humour. Has much of the appeal of Bohnanza -- everyone has fun on everyone's turn, and it doesn't really matter who wins or loses.

Party game...ARRRGG!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The central mechanic of this game is to make up a plausible definition of a given word, hoping to gain votes, and then identifying (by voting) for the real definition.  The game radically changes based on the group playing the game, and requires a certain amount of creativity and ability to write in the voice of a dictionary to really be successful.  The game has the potential to favor wild guesses rather than good definition writing if people are unwilling to vote for a definition already voted on.

RATING: 8
This game is very entertaining, one of my favorite party games. It's basically a bluffing word game. The reader writes down the definition to a word on a piece of paper (the card tells him the word and the definition), and each player writes their own definitions down on their own slips of paper. The reader then shuffles the papers and reads off each definition. The players (except for the reader, who knows the answer) vote on which answer they think is real, and get points for receiving votes. The reader gets points if nobody picked the correct answer. The reader can't lie or leave anything out in his/her reading, but there's certainly room for manipulation in your presentation. There can be some discussion before voting, which offers more bluffing opportunities because you obviously know which one you wrote and you want folks to vote for that one. Some of the answers can be so ludicrous  that you suspect them as false immediately, and sometimes it turns out they were the real answer. It's good for a bunch of laughs.

A great game with the right crowd. First time I played this was at a party (with booze), and we laughed until we cried. Of course, none of the made-up definitions could be put on a family site. I use a version of this game in my English class. Once the students know the rules, they get into it. I have to remind students to keep the definitions school-appropriate or they venture into the salacious. Good game for wordgeeks.

RATING: 6
This game is most fun when you have a large group that is playing - we played once years ago with about 15 people (the things we used for pieces were interesting) and had an absolute blast!  If the number of people is less than 5, it is too easy to figure out who is writing up which fake definition, and it takes the fun out of it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
50-100 plays? We learned this from Aunt Nora and Uncle Reed as kids. Before there was a "boardgame", we'd simply play by taking turns picking obscure words out of the dictionary. All other players would write a fictional (sometimes rdiculous) definition while the turn captain also submitted an accurate definition. All entries were read, voted upon, and if no one voted for the correct definition, the turn captain would receive 1 point for every player in the game. Fictional definitions voted upon would get that player 1 point per vote. Played to an agreed upon number of rounds. Very fun, and wow, didn't require the purchase of a board game.

This one is a staple with my family; I've had limited success at fun when playing outside of them.  I seem to like the original format better than the multiple categories that are found in the latest edition and Beyond Balderdash.

I think Balderdash also has the perfect blend of ridiculous definitions to be useful for my family.  It's not completely useless to start inventing asinine answers to try and make the reader laugh, as they still might sound credible.  We've known that ever since we had the real word, "squitters".

Balderdash always seems to show towards the end of a long game night, with its relaxed atmosphere, and simplicity.  It can appeal to both the lewd, and the serious, and even the competitive.  The version I have is 2 years older than me, and we still haven't used up the cards.

I think this is my least favorite game of all time. It could be because I played with my in-laws the first time when I was newly married and they play games in their own way. I never wanted to play again and finally I was able to give it away to my in-laws!

With the right (literate, inebriated) group, Balderdash is tons of fun. But you need the right group, and the focus shouldn't be on winning so much as getting people to laugh. Does that mean it's not a "game" so much as an activity? Maybe. But who cares?

6 is a pretty standard rating for most party games save the very best -- this one approaches the very best, so let's go with 7.  In a party-ish environment, these games are a fun enough way to pass the time, so I'm happy to partake!

RATING: 7
A fun, social game that taps into the creative part of your mind.  Also interesting to attempt to determine who made up the different definitions.  Would rate a little higher except that you could really just choose words from a dictionary and have a similar game.  That being said, the cards are nice and the board is well-illustrated.

I was really into this party game for a while.  I loved being creative and coming up with answers for all the obscure categories in this game.

This game cracks me up. There are definitions that family members have come up with that I remember to this day, they're so funny. So, on that level, this game is great. As far as actual gameplay goes, I'm not sure how good it is. And one game of it over the course of a vacation, say, is enough. Otherwise, it's a lot like trying to tell the same joke over and over.

Takes a creative mind to do well in this game.. that is.. unless someone realises they only need to memorise the definitions of a few unused words when its their turn to read the card.  People who do that get a definition that can't be connected to them because it didn't come from their head.  Overall one of my favorite party games however.

The success of these types of games really depend on the crowd you play with.  The crowds that like to play these types of games are not normally the types of crowds I like to game with.  Hence, I find this game to be generally unsuccessful.

RATING: 7
Very good for a party game;  it allows for lots of creativity and a little bit of bluffing.  Sometimes it can drag on a bit long near the end though.  With five or six players, the number of definitions usually requires that the reader read them two or more times, which really slows things down.  I think with six or more, a variant could help a lot.

The more creative and literate the players, the more entertaining the game. My greatest gaming triumph of all time was when we played a drinking version of Balderash. I was mercilessly targeted with drinks by those that would see my win streak end in besotted ignominy, yet I still had a slight lead as we neared the finish. On the final word, I scrawled as my definition: "The pack a parachute is stored in." However, I was so drunk that my writing was barely legible. Luckily, my wife was reading, so she managed to decipher it. Well, two players chose my definition, vaulting me to the win. I howled in triumph, collapsed off my chair onto the kitchen floor, and giggling madly in delight at my genius, passed out. My wife couldn't get me to move, so she just threw a blanket on me. I slept the deep sleep of victory.

Great party game if you're with the right group of people.  It's fun wasting a turn just to make somebody laugh.  My mother forced my 15-year-old brother to say the word "penis" in front of her by making it part of one of her definitions.  God that was funny.

RATING: 7
Very fun party game. Can be entertaining and helpful in stretching your creative muscles. My only problem with this game and other types of games like it is when the person who's turn it is is deciding on a choice they are influenced by the others generally or could be chastised for it. Either way, it's still great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The idea behind [thing=163][/thing] is very good to issue fun moments: little known words are read, and players try to provide meanings for them. For each word, players vote for the one they think is the correct (the person that read the word knows the meaning of it, and must also write the proper meaning, but in a way to not make it obvious, as if it is, and everyone vote for it, the reader will receive a penalty). Players receive points by votes their definition receive. 

Yes, [thing=163][/thing] is [thing=39856][/thing], but using words instead of images.

[thing=163][/thing] is fun, sure, but after [thing=39856][/thing], for those that know this one, [thing=163][/thing was basically fired. The requirements for [thing=163][/thing] are higher - it demands more imagination and, well, "work" from the players. Those with a better vocabulary will most of the time be ahead, not only for actually knowing some of the words, but also using the root of the words to come up with definitions that, at least, sound proper.

Still, [thing=163][/thing] gives more laughs around. We laughed when the unknown word was read, simply because we knew it was an actual word, though most sound as alien as if we were listen to other language. We laugh when the crazy definitions were read, sometimes amazed or choked by them. I just don't see this in [thing=39856][/thing], as the clues are often a single word or short sentence, which aren't funny by themselves most of the time, and on the reveal moments (of the cards and the correct answer), even if they do allow for some funny times, are more in "what were you thinking?" area. Both work to allow for a good time, but [thing=163][/thing] is much deeper in the laugh pool.

For my tastes, [thing=163][/thing] is funnier and more clever than [thing=39856][/thing], even when indeed it demands more - playing [thing=163][/thing] with kids is basically impraticle (though some parents will say otherwise defending their amazing genius kids). It is hard, though, to compete with the amazing art and easiness. Therefore, [thing=163][/thing] is a no-show in the group, while [thing=39856][/thing] appears, if not often anymore, in parties and our events.

Fun classic party game. Non-strategy-game and non-board-game players often love social party games, and Balderdash is one of the best, along with Taboo, Say Anything and Wits & Wagers.

One of hte better word games. Always suprise yourself by the things you can come up with as a meaning to the word.  I enjoy this in a large group.

RATING: 7
A fun bluffing party game. You try to write answers that will trick the other players into thinking your answer is the real one. The things you're answering always have crazy answers as well, so ridiculous ideas are never far fetched or unbelievable.

An easy party game for you and your intellectual buddies.  We adapt to the rules, I dislike the board game layout.

Such a clever game. It is sometimes ruined by people who are not well read and with a limited vocabulary.

Brilliant the first 5 or so times with the same group, but once you all run out of ideas it loses the novelty. Dixit completely replaces this.

It's Balderdash. Fun when you play it, but not something you jump to. Maybe I should play it again. It's definitely a party type game though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Great party game, although wouldn't want to play with more than 6, people max.  Requires much more creative effort on the part of the players than a game such as Apples to Apples, so if one player isn't really interested, it hurts the game.  Beyond Balderdash is a more interesting version.

RATING: 7
Like all party games, this one being a word game, you have to have the right people with right personality playing.  My first play was with a group of my buddies that had a pretty creative and at times a warped sense of humor.  We had a blast.  The stuff we were coming up with made us laugh so hard we burst into tears.

However, on my second play, I played with a bunch Chinese Engineers and that didn't work to good.  They were trying to hard and lacked the creativity with words to makes the same so enjoyable.  In short, play with a group that has a good sense of humor or the game can be pretty dry.

RATING: 7
One of the few party games that I play, enjoy, and have some chance of winning.  (See also Wise and Otherwise, etc.) Anything involving creative writing gets a thumbs up from me.

Still, I'd always rather play a non-party game.

RATING: 8.5
I love this game.  I enjoy the original dictionary game, just pick a word out of the "big" dictionary.  Adds extra suspense.  "does anyone else know this ridiculous word?".  Also better openings for longer drawn out definitions, from the dictionary that is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Game requires you play with clever people. The game does little to prevent unfair play. As long as the above condition is met I really like this game.  Otherwise it's a dud.

RATING: 6
Relatively few mass market games are worth the time to play them.  This is one of them.  It also is among a few party games that I like to play.  It is very simple.  Be the best player at making up definitions to obscure words.

This is one of my favorite games that you'll find at Wal-Mart/ToysRUs.  I would suggest playing this game, then switch to Apples to Apples once everyone is too drunk to write legibly.

You know, I don't know if we've EVER played this game by the rules... We use a much freer interpretation, and simply go straight for the bluffing! Fun when you're in the right mood.

RATING: 8
This is the best partygame for me. Played with the right people no game makes me laugh harder than this one. I hate players that try to be funny though; players that write crazy answers on purpose. That's not funny! One of the best things with this game is that there is no limit when it comes to creativity. Awesome game.

The Icelandic version has been a success amongst my family and friends. Possibly because we usually find some silly explanations for the obscure words, which has us laughing the whole session!

A classic word/party game, much loved in my family, especially when you get a silly explanation that is better than the real one!

About as good as you can get as far as party games go. This one is pee your pants hilarious with the right people. It takes very little time to start the game, and the answers are so wildly varied in style that it's difficult to emulate the answers to trick people.

I was given this game when I was quite young (less than 10 years old) by my grandparents.  This has always been one of my favorite party games, hysterically funny and wonderfully creative.  I also own Absolute Balderdash which adds categories.

RATING: 7
Very good game, but it makes little sense that the "reader" gets points for nobody being able to guess the definition for a word the reader didn't even choose.  We played a freeform version of this using a dictionary, and had loads of fun ­ the only real problem with the dictionary version being the wait while people find a good word.  No doubt that could be fixed by using an egg timer to limit the search.

RATING: 6.5
Good party game.  Make sure you get the new edition with 5 categories, adding movie titles, acronyms, strange laws, "famous" people.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After 1 Play: A pretty good party game, but it's important that players do two things.  First, they have to learn how to write their definitions to sound real, and second, the reader has to be able to read all the definitions without giving away the answer.  If the players can do these things, it'll be a fun game.  If they can't the game becomes quite a chore.

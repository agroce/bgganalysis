That we actually finished all three races of the game is a bit of a miracle.  I think after one heat we got the gist, and then it kept going and going and going.  Sheep Race is strictly inferior to Winner's Circle/Royal Turf, a game it feels like it's trying to emulate.  In both games players roll a die on their turn and advance an animal on the track that they either bet on or didn't.  Also, there's a chance to help racers you bet on and nerf those you didn't.  However, the predecessor game is more interesting because the results of the race are a culmination of a series of opportunities for all at the table to do both things.  You actually get to contribute to the outcome a fair bit, even though what you do is based on a die roll.  In the case of Sheep Race, there's basically one or maybe two chances in a race to hurt or help a given sheep, which is just not enough.  The sheep have a given minimum and maximum range based on their starting cubes.  To make it to the end of the track, all sheep need to rest or walk at some point.  But because you can't rest them up until their cubes are mostly cleared off you really can't help the sheep until then.  Most of the time you may do the exact same thing whether you want a sheep to finish well or not.  As a consequence, you have even less control than you would in Royal Turf, which is probably my main fault with that game.  Here it's just awful.  If I could go back in time I'd tell myself to avoid this baaaaad game.

This is perhaps a little silly, but I haven't played a game yet where the players haven't been yelling for a sheep to win the final. Often irrespective of which one they bet on.

Ho scoperto the sheep race...tutti che si son sbellicati/divertiti e addirittura c'è la possibilità di un hard game vest 
---------------------------------------------------------
chiudiamo la serata sempre in 3 con Sheep Race spiego il gioco e partiamo,la prima gara finisce "tranquilla" mentre la seconda sarà solo una pecora ad arrivare....il gioco è veloce,bastardo e piace un sacco. 
Vinco staccando gli altri di ben 20 punti.. è il mio gioco.. 
Gran Acquisto !!!

The cube mechanic was a good idea, the rest wasn't, unfortunately there isn't much here that I would considere a game worth playing.

Super light game, but still enough player interaction and i really like the expert variant that can be found in the BGG board.

The Sheep Race is a fun take on the racing game genre.  I really love how the breathing works and how a player can force a sheep to become exhausted in order put the sheep out of the race.  Breath is extremely important and really makes or breaks the race for the players.  It's a little bit too long for what it is, but in that time, you'll most likely be enjoying the movement of those cute little sheep.

La corsa delle pecore è un gioco allegro, simpatico che offre un'ambientazione divertente e con una componentistica buona. Malgrado tutte queste cose positive il gioco non mi garba per la sua eccessiva dipendenza dal lancio dei dadi. Per la verità si possono provare a mettere in piedi delle strategie, ma il tutto alla fine viene reso vano dai dadi. Gioco quindi allegro, che svolge perfettamente il suo compito ma che non fa troppo per me.

what a cute cutthroat game. I had a blast! Those sheeps are racing and dying fairly quick. some bluffing also involved. love it!

Looks gorgeous, but the race takes a bit too long, and because the dice determine which sheep you move, choices are limited.

I tried this game last night: it's very easy but also very funny!
When you learn the rules (it takes just few minutes and one race) you understand that you can kill the other players' sheep, you can bluff about which sheep you bet on! It's a very nice filler. The cards and the overturned sheep are hilarious.

I like it. Great theme tacked on to a racing game.

Wifey still can't get her head around the breath cubes... Shame :(

Ligero, divertido, mas tactico de lo que parece.
Es un juego de apuestas 1 vista y 2 ocultas, muy ligero, para toda la familia con unas miniaturas superkukis y unas cartas de personaje bastante interesantes con unas ilustraciones muy simpáticas.

Well I like it better than Splendor which is not much of a praise since I really don't like Splendor. I guess that more random chance makes it feel less tedious to me. I don't like the endgame scoring at all though. Seems too euro-like to score unfinished contracts and especially the largest collection that remains in my hand. Also the captain bonus is almost inconsequential.

I love the original Fleet, but it never really played well with 2. This game fixes that, it plays extremely well with 2 players and gives the base feel of the original game but in a different enough way to be unique.

I really like this with 2, would not want to play this with 3 or 4.

A decent game where you are either fishing to complete contracts or gaining new contracts. The cool thing is while you are working on a contract you have a special ability you can use. The downside for me is there is just a bit too many fiddly rules related to how you can use the different types of fish. It felt like these rules were added in to make the game playable. For such a small game all the little rules just add up to something that is too much to keep track of for what the game offers.

Fleet Wharfside is a standalone card game based on Fleet and Fleet: Arctic Bounty. Players compete to complete contracts by selecting contracts from the Market and by collecting fish from their fleet at the wharfside. It's what happens when the fleet comes home!

Once again Pinchback and Riddle take a clever twist and, rather than spinning it out and overburdening it, pare it down to its cleanest form. Then they put it in an appropriately sized box and sell it for a fair price. You gotta love these guys.

Buy this game for Xmas for anyone in your family who plays Cribbage, Rummy, etc. Same length, pace, weight, but infinitely more satisfying.

Egyszerű szabályokkal operáló szettgyűjtögetés, ahol meglepően sok paraméterre kell egyszerre figyelni. Az első játékban csak kapkodtam a fejem így arról még nem mernék nyilatkozni, hogy mennyire csak a szerencsén múlik minden. Volt ilyen gyanúm is, de egyszerűen túl sok felé kellett figyelnem. :)
Mindenképp kell még vele játszani.

Fleet: Wharfside might exist in the same lands as Fleet, but both games play almost nothing alike. Wharfside is a quick-playing card game of hand management and set collection, with some tough decisions at times when deciding how one wishes to spend their cards. Nothing really all that innovative here in regards to the mechanics, but if you like easy-going card games with multiple things to think about (especially how to best spend cards) then you might very well enjoy this one.  There are enough interesting design choices which are enjoyable enough to welcome multiple plays.  There are quite a few scoring criteria, which means you might ignore some to focus on others and end up inadvertently scoring big or small on the ones you ignored (like trophies or captain specialty).  A big plus: "Ridback Bay" is such a different theme from anything else that I would have bought this on theme alone.  So if you're a fan of small-box card games, check this out!

A completely inoffensive game that is only worth playing if it took under 15 minutes. I played a 45-minute game and it was absolute torture. I have no love for the Fleet main game, so the branding doesn't mean anything to me.

After an initial fiddly round or two this game turned out to be a lot of fun with just the right amount of moving parts (the rotating cards and different captains).

This is a great 2-player game with no scale-down issues.

That said, it wasn't short enough to be filler (like my gold standard, Jaipur), yet wasn't super-satisfying as a single play. I'm not sure where that leaves this in terms of getting it onto the table.

Kickstarter.  Not a bad card game.  A little heavier than one would expect from a typical card game but similar to its predecessor.  I enjoyed it.  My friend felt it too random for his taste.  I'd like to play it again but the ease of entry isn't really there for non-gamers & newbs.

This game is simpler than full-on Fleet but it hits the table more often as it's quite short. So that's a big plus in my book.

It's definitely one of the better card games out there and works exceedingly well with two players. I'd rather play this than some dry game like Lost Cities.

[b]Fleet Wharfside[/b] was traded away in a math trade 1/16/17. (Received Zooloretto: The Dice Game)
Was received in a trade (10/25/15).

[COLOR=#FF0000]Update 1/7/17 (6):[/COLOR]

Just played fleet wharf side after a long hiatus... going on the trade pile. Too convoluted for what it offers. Lots of little rules to remember and it's just not that fun when compared to other card games.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Still a card game I enjoy very much, but it doesn't scratch the same itch as Fleet. The combination of set collection and a small amount of tableau building that wraps up in 30-45 minutes. Definitely one I want to get to the table more. I'd recommend checking it out if you are looking for a card game that takes set collection and layers a few more mechanics on it.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I was really excited to get this one since Fleet is one of my favorite games, but it doesn't hit the table as much as I'd like )in part because you need more than 2 players for the game to shine). I was hoping to find another game in the Fleet universe that would be a bit easier to set up and play. After a couple of plays I can happily say Fleet Wharfside has delivered. 

- Plays up to 4, but is still an excellent 2p game that will make a great cafe/pub game.
- While it uses the Fleet theme (and great artwork) the game play is different and timing becomes very important.
- Contract cards are now scored via a set collection mechanic, but until you score them they will give you a special ability to use.
- Buying contracts and buildings (which are worth straight VP in Wharfside) involves collecting a certain type/quantity of cards, but the market changes every time a card is purchased.
- There is a hierarchy to the fish (think poker hands) so you can always substitute a higher ranking set of fish to buy a contract.
- King crab are played to your tableau for VP, but they are also the highest ranking fish when it comes time to buy contracts. [/i]

Original Fleet seems to be more fun (after 1 play). Little bit simplistic gameplay and luck drawing the cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I liked the artwork of the original so don't mind the marketing re-spin. The game is pleasant enough. Spend fish to buy contracts that give you an effect until you complete it (the less the VP's, the more powerful the effect) by allocating the required fish to it (each contract has a different fish requirement). So, collect fish. Collect fish. Collect fish. Spend fish to get contract. Collect fish. Collect fish. Allocate fish to contract. And keep going until someone completes 5 contracts. It seems to be a game of ekeing out maximum VP-conversion possibilities out of each fish you collect. If you care that much. And which may not concern you at all if you simply like collecting fish. If you do, this is the game for you.

played it for the firs time just this morning 7/29/2016. I enjoy it. It's a game that's not samish as it's big brother. It's definitely a game of it's own. I enjoyed my first play. Relaxing and there are decisions to be made. 
thematically I can see myself playing this after a round of regular fleet. All of course with a rainy ocean ambient sound track playing, followed by a dockside ambient soundtrack.

Fleet Wharfside is a card game in which players acquire contracts requiring certain types of fish, claim the fish cards, and the complete the contracts for points. Contracts also grant the players special abilities--but only before they are completed. The cost of contracts varies by a random mechanism, but it can be a little frustrating when many of them get stuck at a high cost. King Crab cards can also be claimed like normal fish cards, but those provide points by themselves without contracts. This is a pretty straightforward game, but it didn't really stand out in any one way.

RATING: 8.5
Wharfside follows in the foot steps of the first two fleet games. Easy to learn and fast to play once you get rolling. Best part it does not have the crate of fish aspect of the cube or fish meeple. So it is not so messy and chaotic. However, if someone is starting to run away with the points it is very hard to catch up to them. If it wasn't for that I would have scored it a 9.5 but it got an 8.5 due to this flaw.

The game felt mechanical -- you go through the motions and keep doing the obvious thing.  There are some interesting choices in theory, but in practice there never seems to be much tension about them.  E.g. it's usually obvious when you should finish a contract and give up its power, what cards you should draw, and which contract to buy.

1 play, 4er (all new)

A set-collection game with changing player powers. Clever balancing required between getting contracts, with unfinished contracts giving you some bonus power, and finishing those contracts, which will actually score you much more VP. Consistent with the fishing theme, you can go fish for cards (grab 2 from the face up displays, and some powers allow you to draw randomly with a chance of keeping what you flip). Finishing bigger contracts may also get you trophy VP. Getting to 4 finished contracts/buildings (5 in 2er or 3er) triggers the end: finish that round and do final scoring (earning a few more VP for a bunch of things). 

It was OK, I suppose, but the randomness of the card flip was more than I enjoy. I’d prefer other games for this length/weight.

tl;dr: fine

Gather resources, fulfill contracts to score points. Not new, but done well or in an interesting, different way, it can be enjoyable. This game doesn't do anything exceptional, but it does work pretty well. There is a nice balance to find with the order of doing things and timing your stuff right. When do you take new contracts? When do you score contracts, loosing the special ability they grant? Or do you simply take the resources you want now before someone else snatches them?
It all works well and is enjoyable, but no new ground is broken here.

Fairly light but enjoyable game.  There aren't a lot of game play options which helps move the game along pretty quickly.  A small amount of tension based on how long you want to ride out the contract abilities before cashing them in.  Have only played 2-player so far, so maybe the market is more of a factor with more players.

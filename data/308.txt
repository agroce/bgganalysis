Had a lot of fun with this in the 90s but it's aged somewhat.

RATING: 5
The first part of the game is so-so, the middle is really interesting and the last few turns are a bit dull because options are limited and you have to play mainly negatively to avoid others cashing in.

I'd play it again and did enjoy it, but it's not as much fun as, say, Through the Desert which has a few similarities - though they are very different games overall.

Sadly, a dull game where so much is out in the open that players take forever to make their moves.

Good alternative to the SFR board game... and you can play it with the SFR pieces.  It seems to play faster.

RATING: 5
I sort of enjoyed it although the 'end game' is a unsatisfying with the final track building pretty much forced. Ticket to Ride is probably a better game - shorter, simpler & easier to understand. But this one is more of a 'gamers game'.

RATING: 7
A game I felt was almost there, but I thought there was just a bit too much randomness as you reach the final destinations.  I can see why it's inspired two remakes so far.

For me, Alan Moon is rather hit or miss, but I found this one to be rather good. It's got the same incremental feel as basically all of his good games; the gnereral feel is very similar to Union Pacific, although not so much as to duplicate it (still, I do think UP is better). Not without some minor but significant issues - the game can feel very defensive and therefore rather constrained, as it's crucial not to open up too many possibilities for the player to your left - but definately a good and enjoyable game.

Obviously an early predecessor of Sante Fe Rails and Clippers, and a pretty decent game as an early development of these games!

RATING: 6
It failed as a 2player game (my oppo just got the 3 doublers and maximised his bonuses). The bits are fiddly, the board is sooo familiar from Alan Moon. But, it's clearly a good game, needing 3 or 4 players to make it work. I'd happily give it another go, but modern players will prefer Transamerica or Ticket To Ride.

Excellent railway game.  Got Clippers to see if it would improve on the basic gameplay, but that versions components made it nearly unplayable.  463/1200.  Now (Feb 09) may be that Steel Driver will fill this route-building niche

I think I prefer this instead of the more advanced (and slightly more complicated) Santa Fe Rails.  SF is fun, elegant and more predictable, and thus, more manageable (especially w. larger group) than SFR.  I have SFR which I will now really only play as SF.  Thankfully, GMT did not alter the board map or cards so conversion is seamless should one wish to play SF or SFR.

Despite the obvious comparison to Transamerica, this has more strategy and you need to plan your moves carefully. The game plays quickly, holds your interest and does not overstay it's welcome.

Plays well at all levels.  My wife enjoys it and it can be a real brainburner with only 2 people.  Definitely one of my all time favorites.  (Some of my Canadian friends are amused that Canada is represented as one space like U.S. cities)

1 play, 3er, using the Santa Fe Rails box.

Relatively few changes from SFR, but enough to change the game significantly:
- being able to build in any direction makes it easier to dead-end lines
- no Short Lines: easier to end the game
- everyone has 2x: more track built, more bonuses paid early on, harder to prevent
- one fewer Branch Line per line: easier to dead-end a line

It seems it's easier to quickly end the game if everyone is not watching for that possibility. Therefore, maybe relatively more valuable to earn quick cash bonuses, versus going for city cards, assuming you can end the game quickly.

I would like to play this again, but I think I prefer the additional options available in SFR.

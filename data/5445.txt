RATING: 10
I have the franklin table top edition. 

NHL icebreaker is my favorite sports game period! And I think it's the best actual implementation of hockey, but rod hockey beats foosball, air hockey, all that arcade hall dexterity stuff. Rod hockey is so fun. With this and Icebreaker...I don't need other sports games at all.

1962 Eagle Toys version of Hockey Face-Off.  Box is in amazing condition for 50 years old!  All 12 players are present as are all 10 rubber?/plastic? knobs on the end of all the rods.  Both plastic nets are undamaged, and playing surface is clean.  My boys, 8 & 11, can't get enough of it.  Players are in very good, playable condition, and it has its original puck.  Artwork around rink is in good condition.  Wonderful piece of hockey game history and Americana.

THE best dexterity game bar none.  

I will never forget playing a metal player version from the 60s at the summer cabin.  Or the time when I played a dome hockey session in Montreal, against a total stranger, and we took the game into triple overtime.  I scored to win the game and then realized there was a crowd of forty, fifty people gathered around watching our battle.

A rod hockey game is a *must* have in any home where hockey is enjoyed.

I gave my son a Stiga set for his birthday.  First of all, the company (Stiga) sent TWO extra teams. 

But the game is soooo much more fun and allows for far more skill than I would have ever guessed. We played for several hours the weekend he received it. I look forward to more play.  Worst of all, I know I need to get a set for myself now. 

One of the quiet beauties of the game: there are no dead spots on the "ice".   The puck is always in play.  With a small amount of experience, you start to learn where you are "safe" with puck control (mostly in the offensive corners).  And how to pass. And, true to real hockey, the best chances for shots are when you are passing laterally in front of the goalie and catch him moving from post to post. What a brilliant game!  I had no idea.

Much better than its electric football counterpart, especially if you used the puck that encircled a ball. The centering pass was deadly against neophytes. My grandfather in his 80s loved playing this. However, the athletes had trouble bearing up under the physical abuse. You had to place them on injured reserve, fix 'em, and then go again.

Finally acquired the Stiga version (the one they use at the World Championships) and I've gotta say, this is nothing like what most people played in their youth.  The old, cheap table hockey boards were ok when we were kids, but this one is awesome.  Even better than the Wayne Gretzky version.  Really it should have its own separate BBG game entry.

Growing up in the 1960s and early '70s, some kid in every neighborhood had one of these sets - and for weeks or even months after getting it for Christmas or a birthday, it would be the most popular game in the neighborhood. Game play is similar to foosball, and it definitely rewards eye-hand coordination. Still great fun ...

Well, When I was a kid this was my favourite game. I had the old STIGA version (similar to the Wayne Gretsky version in image 44549) where a favourite shot was to give the puck to one of the defenders, put the puck against the board and spin him as fast as possible. The puck usually took a huge leap across the 'ice' and straight into the opponents net. Wonderful. Me and a couple of friends played long tournaments, simulating the World Championship or Canada Cup. I think my copy still is somewhere at my parents house. I know I haven't played it in a very long time now.

If this is the spot for all rod hockey games (including the super sweet "bubble hockey" on the professional grade) then this game is a decent way to spend a little bit of time, on occasion.  The good versions make for more fun, as the table-top versions were usually of poor quality (guys falling of their rods, pucks getting stuck behind nets, etc).

(Stiga Play Off Version) The little BGG credibility I had is gone.  One of my favourite games a dexterity game, beer and pretzels game not a eurogame with several action points and strategies or a 3 hour American SF game.  What an oaf.  But I am not ashamed.  This is fantastic, compelling, tense and fast.  If you like sport and have either watched or played ice hockey I challenge you not to enjoy this game.  Improves with repeated plays as skill levels improve and tactics become more evolved.  You need to play fast to create gaps.  But there is no better feeling than hitting a slap shot from the wing into the bottom corner of the net, taunting your opponent (often my brother) and then having a swig of beer.  In my strange world that is the definition of joy.

The Stiga Table Hockey games are excellent products.  Not as great as some of the large dome hockey games, but very fast playing.  With a unique rod set-up, Stiga allows players to reach the puck on any area of the playing surface - there are no dead spots!!  So, action is always happening, no matter what.

A game that brings out joy, intensity, building of character (we play teams 2x2 also), and it has a workout included.

Stiga Play Off was the weapon of choice for kids in Finland. A truly iconic contraption, the base mechanism was and is, of course, ingenious. Ingenious and infuriating. I never really cared for it as it's bit of a hassle, but the fond memories linger.

Our kids got this for Christmas just like I got a copy for Christmas when I was a kid. It's a fun dexterity game and great to play with the family. The physical mechanisms of the game probably wouldn't hold up to the most aggressive teen or adult play but it works great for kids.

Update: The mechanisms didn't hold up to aggressive play but it was good while it lasted.

Another one of those ratings fueled mostly by nostalgia.  This game is a poor man's foosball.  It captivates me in a way that is unusual for dexterity games, and I'll play quite a bit without getting tired of it.  The arcade or full table versions are, of course, much better.  Many editions are somewhat flimsy, so be careful with how young your children are when you introduce it to them, or they might get overexcited and break it.

I played this a ton with my dad growing up.  Lots of fun.  The version he had was the best one I've ever played.  We had replaced the siding with some sort of rubber and the puck flew all over the place.  It was getting on on years though and my dad bought me a new one (Eric Lindros version - when he was a rookie and the next "Great One" ha!)  It is fun but my memories are definitely wrapped around my dad's version which featured the original six teams of the NHL.  The new version did come with an awesome mini Stanley Cup though, so points for that!  My favorite "bit" from a game :)

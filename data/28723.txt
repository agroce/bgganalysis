A bit of press-your-luck, hoping your neighbor doesn't send the ships off before you get yours loaded... only to have them send them just before you planned on doing so and having all of your stuff rot in the warehouse. Not a bad play though, even if it is a bit fiddly with all of the card types.

RATING: 9
The best game from the Phalanx stable, this card game has some great mechanisms, such as the selection of cards available for use on a turn. The decisions seem to centre around timing and like all good games you want the game to move quickly as you make progress in the game. Recommended for people who like trading games. Subsequent games of this have confirmed the qulity of the game, as the decisions are difficult to make. My experience after 3 games is that 2  hours might be needed, at least for initial games as the options are pondered by players. None of the people I played with found this a problem. They will all be getting copies once the game is widely available.

RATING: 8.5
This is a rather cutthroat game, and cutthroat games tend not to attract me. But Before the Wind is such a marvelous game and the competition is such a delightfully complex process (rather than just stabbing someone, one must consider all kinds of ramifications of one's actions) that I can't help but love it! And in terms of player interaction, there just ain't a lot of games that top Before the Wind.
To say that the theme is pasted on is a gross overstatement.....but there are times when the mechanics are very loosely tied to the theme (you can get goods for free, but storing them in your warehouse costs money???). Speaking of warehouses, that's about the only component failure of the entire game: the warehouses are pathetically small for fitting all of your cards onto.
There are two other significant drawbacks: the game is a little too long for what it offers; and the rules are (at points) a little difficult to figure out, but one session should solve that problem.

RATING: 6
Now thats an evil game. I have never seen before an extortion mechanic in a boardgame. The game seems simple. All you have to do is to fill the boats with the goods they need. The strategy is to slow down your opponents (by not selecting the actions they need and by extracting money from them) while you try to move forward. Its all about timing. The downside of all these is that the game can last for quite some time. By the way nice art on the cards.

RATING: 6.75
Before the Wind is an interesting (sort of) bidding game with mechanics which I have not really seen in other games. The fun factor is quite good, but the game is really cutthroat and a group of "friendly" players wouldn't really enjoy it. The game end suddenly when a player gets 50 points and this is one reason for a rating below seven. The game is well balanced through its mechanics and while some players may get better cards, there's no reason to blame it on anything else but sub-optimal strategy.

This can be a tough game, especially as a two player.  It is essential to balance your play so as not to find yourself in a losing hole.  The game is quite good, but the harshness may not align with some people.  It is not so much confrontational as prone to frustrating mistakes.  You must work within the engine that drives the game forward as going it alone will not likely work as well as one might hope.  Despite all this, I do think the game shows promise and probably should get played more than it does.

Szép játék, de eléggé vontatott volt nekem, örökkévalóságnak tűnt az 50 pont elérése. És semmi fejlődés nincs, ha 100 pontig mennénk, akkor is ugyanezt csinálnánk, csak dupla ennyi ideig. De a legnagyobb baj a királycsinálás! Keresztbe tettem az épp vezető játékosnak, mert tudtam, hogy különben megnyerné (fölényesen). Így végül a következő körben lett vége a játéknak úgy, hogy ő végül tök utolsó lett, mert időközben minden áruja berohadt. És egész végig ő állt győzelemre. Ez így elég komolytalan. A licitálós mechanizmus a játék veleje, elsőre nagy ötletnek tűnt, de az is nagyon királycsinálós, mert semmi sem írja elő, hogy a nagyobb összeget kell elfogadnom. Sok sebből vérzik a játék, de ha mondjuk 25 pontig játszanánk, még adnék neki egy esélyt:)

Before the Wind is an efficiency game that rewards forward planning, but also does its best to randomly thwart you.  

There are 3 steps players need to follow in order to score points.  1st you acquire goods, 2nd you store goods, 3rd you ship goods.  Players carry out these steps by bidding for one of the face-up cards.  Unfortunately the game is ruined by special action cards.  Not only are some of them overpowered, but they also restrict players from advancing to the next step.  

For example, I had acquired goods and REALLY needed to advance to step 2 by storing my goods.  Instead of revealing 2 store goods cards, 2 special cards were revealed, which meant that I had no way of advancing to the next step that turn.  I prefer efficiency games in which the players are responsible for thwarting me, not the stupid deck.

Respect for a card game that could have easily been overproduced to make it a board game. The mechanic offers near perfect knowledge to all players excepting the uncertainty of what cards will be turned for selection. Opportunities for screwage and underhand behaviour, I think my rating will grow with more plays.

Fascinating game - the lo-ball for cash, hi-ball for card choices in the auction can be excruciating, and not just for the bidders. The basic flow of get goods - store goods - ship orders is thematic enough but much of the detail manipulation is theme free and fiercely core gamer. I particularly like the way that players requirements diverge rapidly and so the lots have wildly different values for each player. Active player's control of the content of the available lots is also a great feature, as is the draconian spoilage at the end of the turn.

A good game that's almost great. I love the extortion (I mean, bidding) mechanism, but the rest is pretty so-so. It's frustrating when you're the starting player and you get screwed by the card-draw factor.

Would've benefited immensely by being more financial and less euro (money is only the second tie-breaker!): the game really is all about the set collection, even if the money is the most interesting part of it.

Also, you get no feeling of growth during the game: the last round is pretty much like the one before that, and so on. Perhaps different decks of ships for each round would give the game a different flavor. Like it is, it kinda feels like you're doing the same thing over and over.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Ultimately, there are too many little decisions to make in this game, and the game drags on for far too long.  Plus the switch-eroo cards tend to break the game... allowing one player to score big, but leaving the other player with unexpected crap.  Nice effort, but I think I'll stick to the game called Medici which has the same boat-loading theme and shorter play time.

Nice card management game spiced with a niffty auction mechanism. Interaction is realtivly high, as you have to watch out the plans and the money flow of yor concurents. Has room for some nasty plays. The right timing is in this game everything. Only downside of this game is for me the anticlimatic end game. The score of the players are hidden and the end game is triggerd by hitting 50/60 points.

Played a game with Amanda.  She didn't care for it and we didn't finish.  Not sure what the issue was.  It's an auction game where you're buying action cards that allow you to purchase, play in front of you and sell/ship goods.  First to 60 points win.  The auction is the game.  Active player selects a card; others can bid for it, active player either takes a bid (doesn't have to be highest) or pays bid to the player.  Then both players are out of the round.  So, getting cash means no card for the round.  It would take a couple of plays to get the valuation right.  Not sure if I'll keep it long enough to get those plays in with regular groups of players or not.

Attractively different - a very interesting auction system makes the game.  While seemingly straightforward - once you get the hang of things - there's enough interaction to keep the result in question untill the final card is played.  I also like the nicely subdued artwork on the cards, which fits in very nicely with the setting.  And surely I can't be the only one who hears Van Morrison each time I see the title? OK, just me then.

RATING: 6
UPDATE: Before the Wind is now on probation in my collection. I think it's clever, but it has a very high frustration potential as you set around waiting for a critical action while all the players flip everything but the one thing you need to do. I want to like it, but for this reason the endgame can get really problematic. I suspect this is on the way out. Despite the one mission card that is overpowered, its sister-game Age of Discovery is a lot more fun to play (although the two don't share a lot other than publihser, release date, and price point).
---
Before the Wind is right on the bubble. I rank it a 7 now, but I doubt it'll stay there: it'll end up either a 6 or an 8.

I like a lot about this game: for a small-box game it's got a number of different things going on (you've got to both evaluate cards and manage a production pipeline), it's not too long, it's got relatively constant action, many of the decisions are tricky, and of course it's got a gorgeous Phalanx production that does an excellent job of merging form and function.

The problem is that it's a little bit too samey at a touch over an hour, a bit repetive. It's not too bad, but for me was definitely noticeable - by the end I had gotten past getting into the groove of the game and it had started to become a rut. Also, the theme is thin - you're spending money to acquire and ship resources, but the investments and evaluations you make are a little too abstract to engage (bidding over the right to acquire a lot of silk makes some sense, but why do you have to bid over the ability to store goods in your own warehouse? And why do the other players exercise so much control over whether or not you can even get stuff you've bought into storage? And what does a card "in hand" but not "in the warehouse" actually mean, thematically? It's partially there, but there are just a few too many abstract bits for the theme to work).

Like several other Phalanx small-box games, I liked it, but it didn't go over all that well with my fellow-players. I'd definitely play it again, but I'm not sure how many takers I'll find. Compared to the contemporary Age of Discovery, AoD seemed to go over better, both because it was edgier - each decision mattered more, and so it avoided becoming repetitive - and tighter thematically.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pretty decent for a set collecting type game, but I thought it was really slow to develop and a little long for what it does.  The way of acquiring cards was interesting, but it takes a long time to get the right card combinations that allow you to make a delivery for points.  Also, the cards that allow someone to swap cards with another player are devastating to the players they get used on, setting them back 2 or 3 turns.  I'm not sure I liked that, but perhaps bidding for those cards should have been more fierce!

I really liked this game of buying and shipping goods. It uses a very nice mechanic of choosing what cards are on offer during a turn and then people bid for them or just keep them and use the action involved. Has a nice flow to the game. 2 Plays.

RATING: 6
Based on 1 play with 4 players (and like, half a learning game with 2):

I'm kind of on the fence about this game, but the group didn't like it so it's unlikely I'll figure out where I really stand anytime soon.

Theoretically there's a really great mechanic here where you can bid on actions other players want to take... and they either have to accept your bid, giving you the action or pay YOU to keep it for themselves. It's a really effective way to add some interesting player interaction to an otherwise painfully straightfoward affair. I would LOVE to see this mechanic in pop up in other games, truly.

That bidding mechanic feels like this should be the heart of the game, but honestly it didn't come up as often as I would have liked on our first run. Every couple of turns or so when someone didn't find an action they wanted (or there was only one two people were vying for, or in the very late game just to keep a shipping action away from the leader) it would happen, but mostly it was only one person bidding, especially in the early game. The thing is I'm not sure how much incentive the game gives to engage with the bidding more - we ended our first game all REALLY close (two players poised to win on the final turn, another poised to win on the turn after, and the fourth not far behind) after a pretty nice playtime.

That bring us to the action selection mechanic. Each turn the starting player must draw a number of action cards equal to the number of players from 3 different decks (goods, storage, and shipping). This is the mechanic I'm the most divided on - on the one hand, it absolutely forces you to pay attention to what other people are doing and play accordingly. Every time you select actions, you're attempting a balancing act of trying to offer goods others will take (or better, fight over) that won't get them TOO far... while trying to get the most beneficial thing you possibly can for yourself. The problem is it's partially luck of the draw. You'll be drawing fairly reliable actions but actions vary just enough, and there are a number of special actions that it all feels kind of hard to account for, and people will end up just getting useful things unchallenged. Maybe just "always making sure you have enough money to react to anything" didn't feel interesting enough to carry a whole game for me.

The problem with all of this though is that choices tend to feel obvious as the game is incredibly rigid. Actions must be performed in a very specific order (get some goods, store them, ship them) and that means there's not a whole lot of ways for people to obfuscate their plans - making the choice of what decks to pull from and who to pick on pretty easy most of the time.

It also just feels plain weird to essentially reset almost all of your progress every round, but that's the kind of thing I would put up with if I were more enamored with the rest of the game.

Also, small component complaint: the first time through, the special cards are pretty esoteric. There's not a lot of them so it's not a huge deal, but we found ourselves forgetting what even cards we'd seen before did. Would have benefited from some symbols or text on these, I think. They try to make it clear through art but it just didn't work for us with some of those.

Another stinker from Mayfair.  This game reminds me of St. Petersburg (although excruciatingly longer). You do all these manipulations and think you have all this control.  However, the game is about who draws the right cards when they need them.  Yeah, there is a auction mechanic, but it is flat.  Although, it is the only thing keeping the game from playing itself.

Card game with very clever mechanics: turn four cards from three decks (take goods into hand, move goods from hand to warehouse, move goods from warehouse to ship). Choose a card but other players can offer you money for the card. If you refuse, you must pay them instead!

I found it to be overly long (though the group I played with weren't speedy). Also I don't generally enjoy screwage or kingmaking situations which I imagine would occur quite frequently. Finally, that name. Something like: "Before the Wind Blows Your Ship Somewhere More Interesting, You Must Endure An Eternity of Bickering and Protracted Delays at the Dockside" would be better. Maybe that's what it was until they shortened it to the first three words?

Before the Wind, aka: the game of continuous extortion.

BtW presents a very basic situation: ships await goods. You have to procure goods, pay to warehouse them, and then ship them out. Each of these three actions requires a card. The active player flips over action cards of their choice of those 3 types on their turn and then selects one. The next player can either take an unchosen card, or make an offer for the card that the first player selected. Other players who do not have money or a face down action card in front of them can also make offers, higher, lower, or equal to the one made by the first person. When it gets back to the person who had the card, they can either accept any offer made, taking the money and giving up the card, or they can refuse the offer, paying 1$ more than was offered to the person who wanted the card. The goal of the game is simple: fill ships with goods to gain VPs, as players race to a set total. Ships sail when there are two or fewer left, and at that point left over goods in hand rot, as do many of the items present in the warehouse.

For a fairly simple game, BtW offers a very interesting, nasty experience. It reminds me of Goa's auction in a 2 player game in certain ways, but ratchets it up yet another notch because of the decisions involved in which action cards to make available, how to keep actions away from other players, how to profit by making offers when you don't want a given action, and how to profit by selecting action cards that you don't intend to keep.

Definitely only suitable for gamers, and probably requires the right group. Playing this game requires stomping on people's hopes and dreams with cagey offers, making the opponent's goods rot, and taking advantage of momentary weaknesses. If these kinds of things sound at all fun, highly recommended. If not, stay away; far, far away.

Aside: wonderful art. Very evocative, yet functional.

I really enjoyed this; I'd certainly like to play again.
It's simple and appealing. I wouldn't call it subtle, but it has a number of clever mechanisms.  The ability to control (to some degree) which types of action cards are going to be turned up on your turn (production, warehousing, or shipping) is very reminiscent of the role selection in Puerto Rico, but not as absolute.  The selection/drafting/bidding/compulsory auction of these cards is sort of like Medici vs. Strozzi (in effect rather than in detail).

Kereskedős játék. Nem túl szépek a lapok (komor a hangulata), és a kicsit hasonló Meuterenél gyengébb. Ennek ellenére megvételét nem bántam meg, de többet vártam tőle.
Leginkább az zavar benne, hogy a játék legvégén szerencse dönt a sorrendről. Kétszer is úgy nyertem, hogy tudtam: csak azért nyertem, mert az előttem levő játékos nem csapott fel olyan lapot, amivel elszállíthatta volna a nyersanyagokat, így megszerezve annyi pontot, amivel ő lesz az első (hajóskártya helyett 2 "extra lap" jött elő, pl. a felkiáltójel). 

Szóval a lapfelcsapás nagy rizikó benne, és bár sok negatívat írtam róla, mégis van benne valami, ami miatt nem sorolom a rossz játékok közé, sőt nagyon jó kikapcsolódás. Azon játékok között van, amivel még anyósom is leült játszani és élvezte! :)

Happy with my 1st play so far. It reminds me of Puerto Rico (although I was apparently the only one) in that you get resources, load them (well, store them in BtW), and then ship them. Admittedly the gameplay is very different. Although it still sort of has the "choose from the remaining choices on your turn" thing going. It's fairly straight-forward and computable, but I enjoyed it with the group that didn't think too hard. I like the way you can choose something that someone else already picked, and they MUST either accept your (or any else's) offer, or pay the offer amount to keep it. And receiving the money form someone who chose to keep their item is all you get for the turn, so it had better be a decent amount of money. It's not like you can pick someone else's thing just to get to them to waste a couple bucks. You're hurting yourself by doing that as well. There are some "exception" cards which do somewhat wacky things, which aren't too bad and keep things just enough unpredictable to keep you on your toes. Definitely one of the best Phalanx games I've played (probably 2nd to Maharaja, and slightly beating out Heart of Africa).

Where is all the praise for this title coming from? I simply don't get it. Players must collect various goods (represented by cards) in their hands, move them to a warehouse (which is just a row on the table), and from there load them onto several waiting ships. If a certain number of ships remains, all goods in the hands of the player perish, as well as half the amount stored in his warehouse. Ships are worth points, and whoever reaches a prescribed number first, wins the game. Driving the game is a sort of auction of various actions which allow the players to carry out the above activities. All in all it's not a bad concept (at least not technically), but I found actual gameplay to be lacking.

I think this is because you have little control over how you move your goods through the various stages of acquisition to loading. A number of actions is turned over each round, and the player doing that can chose the type based on what he already turned over. This allows for some finetuning of what happens that round, but there is no guarantee that what is eventually on offer is useful. The flow of the game becomes a series of stops and continuations which grow ever more irritating as time progresses. The game dictates the pace of the entire procedure, and won't let players get ahead too easily. Yes, there is some interesting manoeuvring going on once there is action contention (what is an action worth to you, and can you [i]really[/i] spare the cash?) but the entire thing stalls too often to make these moments worthwhile. As a consequence, I feel the game takes too long for what it is and tries to achieve. Hence my puzzlement why this game is generally so appreciated: I cetainly have little intention to play again any time soon.

I really liked the artwork and what the cards represented.  The turns made sense and I liked the bidding aspect a lot.  Another commenter called it extortion rather than bidding...and I have to agree.  That really lets you mix things up.  The only problem I have is that it is too obvious what each player is planning.  Shipping goods takes slow deliberate steps, so it is hard to sneak up on anyone.  If this could be solved, I would be all over it...especially if it had full sized card.

The players take the roles of traders, trying to fill their warehouses with goods which are then in turn transferred to the ships in the harbor. They have to pay attention to the right combination of goods because the captains only accept the goods from a single trader and expect a complete delivery before their ships leave the harbor. It is also very important to not let the right moment to transfer goods to the vessels pass, because the fleet will leave the harbor when the storage space is full and the winds are helpful. The players always have to be before the wind to actively influence the events.

Needs at least another play before the final verdict. :) Some of the special power cards felt very powerful after one play, but perhaps they will be less important once you understand the game better. A bit too long in my opinion.

Players represent merchants, ensuring goods are purchased, stored in their warehouses, and speedily put onto a ship for victory points.  Neat auction/management game where players either claim and action an action card each round, or initiate a bid on another player's claim.  Lots to carefully consider, including both your own and your opponent's interests.  Definitely a gamer's game packed into a small box.  Early impressions very positive.  Later impressions negative!  Too long, too same-y, too much kingmaker at the end of the game, and the English rules too confusing on critical points of the game.  Good try though.

There is a three-step process here to play your cards.  First, to get them into your hand.  Then, into your warehouse.  Then onto a ship.  It's a bit flat and tedious, but there is some uniqueness in the ability to bid on cards people have selected already.

I really enjoy this Phalanx/Mayfair release, as there are some interesting choices to make as the dealer for the round chooses which types of cards (goods/storage/shipping) should be available for auction for the round.

RATING: 5.5
The game is OK.  I like the analogy of it described as a complicated version of Splendour. The objective is to 'buy' the ship cards with various goods, but players are required to first spend money to put the goods into their warehouse.  Somewhat jarringly, they can receive goods cards for free, but have to pay to put them into their warehouse, where they can then be used to fill the ships and take the ship card.  A key difference however, is each round a player can interfere with opponents' choices, by bidding on the card their opponent has just claimed. If the opponent still wants it, he needs to outbid and then pay the cash to the player who placed the (usually) highest unsuccessful bid.  But if no one had bid for the card, he would receive it for free.  

Interesting, but arghhh! None of this makes any sense intuitively or thematically, nor even does the turn end trigger (when 1 ship is left), nor even the title itself (as the last ship disappears/sinks?).  Perhaps this is a translation of something.  There are a lot of little decks meaning all the mini-cards need to be sorted prior to play, but there are less decks than Dominion - though that game has a proper organiser.  I do like the large amount of hidden information in Before the Wind - always good for bidding, but all the effect of bidding is eventually just more points.  There are a few other things to be gained (money, blocking oppoinents and a few temporary special abilities), but overall the game runs too long for what it is.  I'm a bit on the fence - I think I like it, but I just don't think I want to play it all that much.  Maybe it's the art and colours.  I've tried it 4p and 2p and the latter didn't really work, so I suppose 3 is the sweet spot.

Another thing - this game screams out to me that it needs a re-theming, a new title and new art!  The art is good, very elegant, but so boring and unispired for this game and even the theme.  I sense they were looking for a still-life representation of the 17th century Dutch golden age, but the cards are so muted in deep blues and parchment-coloured hues, the ships, warehouses and action cards are silent and absent of people and the ships at harbour are all forlornly vacant, dark silhouettes reminiscent of the Flying Dutchman.  I'm not really sure I understand the theme perhaps, or else I didn't feel it came through at all - especially receiving the goods for free, but having to pay for storage, but then getting free shipping.  As well, I would have preferred that end game money somehow factor into scoring, as scoring can be very swingy.  The game can end quite abruptly (some ships are worth 2 pts, some 5, but most are in the 16 to 18 point range), but I guess that's like Splendour too ;^)

[5 plays]  Good clean evil fun.  The more players, the more interesting and active the blackmail round becomes.  

Tried this once with 2, and did not like it as a 2-player.  I think the main problem is that with only 2 cards, and having to take them from different stacks, it takes ages to get anything done, and the game really drags.

Do you like games that require ruthlessness and cunning and are unforgiving of mistakes?  Do you like looking at your opponents' faces when you shut them out of a resource they need? If so, this is the game for you. 

What makes it so ruthless is that the start player gets to determine which resource cards to make available for bidding (and will try very hard not to put up what you need) and then players select actions they want OR offer another player money for the action they selected, ie, a bribe. That player must accept the bribe or pay that person off (assuming they have enough money). Thing is, the bribee doesn't get to select another action that round, so they're shut out from actions.  Your money or your action, sir?

Similar to Goa, the power shifts as players pay each other off. Money is hidden so you need to pay attention to who's collecting and get a sense of what a good bribe is.  And as some action cards require money to be activated, you need to ensure you have enough money to make the bribe as well as activate the card. Otherwise you look (and feel) very stupid. ;p)

There's a standard euro process of A to B to C in getting goods, putting them in storage, and then shipping them for VPs. Trying to execute the process with other players taking cards from you and blocking you makes this game what it is.

I recommend this as a tight, tactical game of jabbing elbows at each other, but you better have an evenly balanced group and you better pay attention to your opponents while playing. This is not multi-player solitaire!

Three hours but loads of fun. It is amazing that here is yet another game of filling warehouses and shipping goods with some special actions thrown in; haven't we seen this before so many times and yet... yet another brilliant game appears. The balance of options, the money flow, the special actions themselves, everything seems perfectly balanced. One minute you seem to be in a hopeless place, then suddenly all is right with the world. I think this game's special trick is the way the bidding to get chosen actions works. If you pick a card, when my turn comes around, I can offer you money for it. You can pay me off or accept the money, but we are BOTH out of the round. This creates some very tricky decisions and we had a whale of time. Very very nice game and I strongly recommend it. Nice graphics too. ***  Played again, a faster game, still great fun, lots of choices, and I WON!! A very tight gamers' game, put it on your shopping list.

Only one play late at night at Origins...  We were learning the system but I really liked it and love the look of the cards, very nice artwork and a beautiful nautical theme.  The old ships on the cards pulled me into this purchase.  It's a game about buying and shipping goods, with decisions about when to add goods to your hand and when to take money instead.  You pick up goods for free but pay to add them to your store house.  Certain goods spoil at the end of a round if not shipped so you can mess up other players by loading several ships quickly.  If you load a ship you keep it for its victory point value (bigger ships need more goods but are worth more VPs) and the game ends when a set VP level is reached.  It's a nice break from all the games with wooden cubes.  Lots of cards but don't let the economic theme scare you, it's an easy rule set (you'll catch on after one round) and I look forward to more plays.  It's an 8 for me after a learning round, and it has sparked my interest- which is a good sign.  The visuals of the game and the theme have a positive impact on my rating, you may not respond to it as I did.  If you play it you will want to eat cheese... 

Played more, works great 2 player, I'm bumping it up to a 9.  Gets better as the mechanics become second nature.  Reminds me of Medici in that you are constantly evaluating and guessing at each cards value.  Like Medici, the cards are worth different amounts to different players.

A card game about collecting sets of goods to then load onto ships for victory points. Doesn't sound very exciting? The theme is anything but fresh, that's for sure, but it's the action selection mechanism that makes the game.

Each turn turn, the start player reveals as many available actions as there are players. Then, each player selects one of those actions to use. If it is still available you simply take it, but if it has already been taken by another player you offer a bid for it, and the player who has the card can either accept the bid and forfeit hi9s action this turn or match the bid, pay you, and keep the card.

That kind of bidding often borders on extortion. (Who am I kidding? It is extortion!) The one possible flaw is that in many cases the best action is to deny the other players what they need, and I'm not usually a fan of games where delaying everything is the way forward. They tend to go on for much too long. I didn't find that to be a problem with Before the Wind, though. The turns still move along crisply, and the strong interactivity keeps it from getting stale.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Fun game with interesting mechanics, but it induced a lot of AP for us.  It's hard to get a handle on what you should be bidding for things.  It's also hard to formulate much of a strategy because you don't know what actions will be coming up in the future and it's easy for your opponents to thwart your plans by competing for your action and/or attacking you with a warehouse trade.  In that sense, it's very tactical.  If you end up short on either goods or money, you could end up with little to nothing to do for several turns, which just isn't fun because there's nothing you can do about it until those cards come up again.

Played once.  It was okay, but flat and uninspired.  I doubt I'll play again.  The game drags on too long without anything new or exciting happening.  Also, the "swap a good with an opponent" card absolutely does not fit with the rest of the game, and threatens to ruin what little enjoyment the game contains.  A near miss.

As we've come to expect from Phalanx, the rules bungle a critical point.  After you have selected a card, you may not bid in auctions for the rest of the round!  You will either end up with the card you selected, or the money someone else has paid you to wrest that card from you.  Nowhere in the rulebook is this explained, it is merely left to our imagination.  Example, in a 4-player game, players A,B,C,D.  A selects a card.  B selects a card.  C wants the card A selected, and makes a bid for it.  D may now make a competing bid for that card, but B may not bid.  Phalanx, please start blind testing your rulebooks, which are the worst in the business (see also Revolution: The Dutch Revolt, Age of Napoleon, Heart of Africa, Italia, etc.).

Rating after one 2player game. Boring experience, no interesting options. Dull gameplay. Just a repetitive "take goods, store goods, ship goods" sequence. Not a breathtaking new concept for a 2007 game, isn't it? Furthermore you have constantly to look up what the pictograms mean (red actioncards) which means "ergonomy issues". The contra-bidding auction mechanism blocks efficiently a two player game, as a result, it drags on for very long and could therefore be considered broken as well. Maybe it's better with more players but honestly, I am not motivated to find out after that bad experience.

It has a slightly original way of acquiring cards, but a completely unoriginal theme of "shipping goods for VPs". Very nice artwork, despite the dull subject matter. And there is not much beyond that. Although there are some subtle tactics, it is one of those games that give the players an illusion of control but feel quite random in the outcome. In my only game, a complete newbie won, more than doubling the points of the second player (me). And the end did feel abrupt, as other people have commented. There are some special cards that mess with other players' strategies, and the one that allows exchanging one good with an opponent is particularly annoying and out of place. There is also a production flaw, in that the player mats (warehouses) are much smaller than they should be.

similar to other games where you're collecting resource cards to achieve some other goal.  What sets this apart is the bidding portion is an extortion game.  offers are made to buy card from active player.  that player has to either take the money and give up the card, or pay the money to keep it.  creates some great unkind player interaction.
3rd play was two player - better to play medici vs. strozzi with two.

The auction mechanic is very novel and interesting, and the rules are surprisingly accessible and simple. Shifting goods from hand to warehouse to ship is quite engaging, and playing the other players is a blast. I wish it were a tad shorter, though.

Another (somewhat unknown) great game in a small box.

While it's about getting stuff, putting it in your warehouse to ship it out later, this is a very tight and cutthroat game! It sounds like something a thousand other games already do, but this works different and definitely feels different, which makes it despite it's theme (which I don't mind) a very nice game.

Good stuff for a small and cheap box full of cards.

Was merchant shipping really this hard? I suppose cheese must have fetched a fair price in the colonies... :)

An interesting mechanic that combines regular auctions with a heavy take-that mechanism. This part of the game is really interesting. Problem is that everything you do with the cards gained from the auctions is so hard that it feels a bit too much like work. The very old and worn-out theme doesn't much help, either. If this had a space- theme I might raise my rating by a full number!

Fantastic game with gorgeous artwork.  Love the extortion mechanism and the way it forces you to rethink your tactics when the action cards get bid on.  The feeling you get when you snag two ships instead of one and cause the other ships to sail away is priceless!  Just bought a second backup copy, I love it so much.

This is a card game that seems to expands upon the Captain Phase in Puerto Rico. Players acquire goods, which they must then transfer to warehouses, which are then loaded on to a number of ships, for victory points. The more complex and larger the load, the more VP. When a sufficient number of ships are loaded, the fleet sails, possibly preventing some players from getting VP. The active player chooses exposing cards from one of three decks: goods, warehouse actions, and shipping/income. He/she must choose carefully, as they want to get cards that give them the advantage, while placing the others at a disadvantage. However, any card selected by one player, can be bid upon by another player; the card-owner can either accept the bid and relinquish the card to the other player, or match the bid him/herself. In this manner, players can extort other players, making them pay dearly for cards they wish to play! This seems to be the heart of the game, which is otherwise very straightforward and simple.

Update (08/26/10) 2 plays: There is a reason why I HATE narrative rule books and long for the rules format of AH's X.X.XX bulletized format. It looks like I messed up two or three rules from the first play, and this time resulted in a disastrous 4x restarts! 1) The starting player can only take a max of 2x cards from each of the three decks, 2) The rule regarding the selection and bidding of action cards was extremely confusing, and 3) We were not sure if a "safe" card could undo another safe card played previously in the same round. There were several details buried within the narrative rules format that were easily overlooked, but would have been plainly obvious (and easy to locate) in the bulletized format. The rules confusion almost broke the game, and the reputation may have been irrevocably damaged, such that this game may never see the light of day again. I hope we can forgive and forget, as it seems to be a very good and fast-paced card game.

* * *

After reading the rules forums, I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks the rules are poorly written. During our 4x resets, there was a great amount of contentious debate about the rules interpretion, so much that at several occasions I was ready to just drop the game there and then. So, my advice is to read the rules AND check out the rules forum before your first play.

Description: A game about merchants shipping goods.

Pro: I-cut-you-pick auction dynamic. Gift-stealing style action selection. Urgency added by goods spoiling after each round. Three action card decks add specialization and variety. Combines many unique mechanics into an intriguing game centered around player interaction. Requires significant strategic planning to make progress (planning at least a few steps ahead). Other players can stonewall a leader by choosing not to draw a certain type of card (e.g. shipment cards).

Con: Light theme, pasted on mechanics. Not suitable for casual gamers. All players must be roughly equivalent in skill to balance the game. Warehouses should have been full player mats or non-existent, small central square doesn't work well.

First play with 3. Before the Wind has some original rule mechanics, very good quality components and requires a significant degree of tactical play. I enjoyed this first game, though it lasted far too long at almost 2 hours; the end game, in particular, dragged out as each player was in a position to win with one more shipping and so we all focussed on trying to delay the other players' plans.

The auction mechanic for the card is sweet and provides an unique feeling.

Is this the worst named game of all time?  Arguably.  Not only does it invite juvenile references to flatulence, it also tells you nothing about the game.  That said, there is some real innovation in the card drafing system used here.  It is well worth a play on that basis.  But, it also has some notable problems.  First, while the artwork is atmospheric and reminiscent of a harbor scape from a Dutch master, it definitely puts form over function.  Secondly, the game ends when someone reaches 50 points.  The problem is, most players are likely to enter the final round within 10 points of 50.  The final ships tend to be between 16-20 points.  So, that makes the final round a race.  Unfortunately, while there is some control to the race, it has a very arbitrary feel to it.  So, the game fell down on the end game for me.  Lastly, everyone who played it seemed to feel it went on a tad long for its own good.

Tight game requiring good play to do well. The mechanisms for the drawing (and subsequent auctioning) of each round's new cards makes this a lot less dependent on luck of the draw than many card/auction games.

You need a good understanding of what you want to do and a reading of what you think your opponents want to do. Timing is very important, both in terms of making the most of the turns in which you are the lead player, and in terms of planning for the end of each round (which shakes up the game situation a lot).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
We still have to iron out the 'face up'-'face down' nature of the cards that are picked (i.e.-if a card is passed over is it turned face down?), but even so... the game plays great either way.

I like money games and trading games, and this game scratched that itch perfectly.  The auctions can be cutthroat and money changes hands frequently.  It's very rare that you get a card for free and money is tight... you have to pay to take goods into your hand, then pay even more to store them in your warehouse.

You only get Victory Points for shipping, but you lose even more due to spoilage if you don't.

A great 'screw your neighbour' game... a small box with a 'big' game that easily rates an 8.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The interaction between the players on this is superb. Highly recommended with 4, otherwise, table something else. 

On your turn you may choose to view a number of cards equal to the number of players.  These cards may come from three different decks - Goods, Storage, and Income/Ship.

You may then choose one.  The next player chooses one, and so on.  The great interaction is that a player may choose a card already chosen by a previous player.  When this happens, the remaining players who haven't yet received a card may place a bid.  Once all bids are placed, the owner of the card chooses one of the players' bids and either pays them the bid to keep the card OR accepts the bid for payment of the card.  Each player may either colelct money from a bid OR keep a card.  This gets very, very interesting once a player or two is low on money.

Admittedly, it plays a little long, but just a little.  The mechanics and fun factor this provides is worth the time investment though.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.9
With 3 players, this is a very "tight" tactical game without a lot of room for error. The "Auction/Bidding" mechanism very rarely involved an actual conflict between two bidders. I expect that it would be much looser and less predictable with 4 players.

There's a minor problem in the English rules: you can't bid on a card if you have a face up action card in front of you (in addition to a face down action card or guilders).

It took some work to get this to the table - I guess the title and artwork don't stand out.  I personally really like the artwork style - it looks like a game for adults that is more evocative than illustrative.  Still, the drab theme and plain illustrations mask the evil nature of the game.  The game is all about extortion - trying to get the most money out of your opponents as possible.  If someone is getting by without having to pay very much, that person is most likely ahead in the game.  

I admit that the game drags out a little too long, hopefully this can be improved with experience.  But I felt engaged throughout the game, which was full of laughs.  One thing to remember: never let anyone know how much money you have.  One player revealed the amount of money he had in hand, spent it all, and then lost the card he acquired for $1 by the next player!

Those who complain that it goes on just a tad too long for what it offers, may...may be right.  If the game does go long for repeat plays, consider cutting the game down to something like 2-3 turns (ships leave the docks).  Who knows, maybe that will help.

There are interesting mechanics but the game is so broken. One of the broken element of the game can occur if you end up one turn not having any food. If it occurs, you lose a complete step phase because other players will not draw food cards anymore. Instead, they will draw 4 conservation and then 4 ship cards, which are useless to you, before you get back to food cards. So you basically lose 2 turn doing nothing. 

My friends said that you can still challenge people for money, but the problem is that money will not compensate for the cards I don't have. It's not like if I could play X$ to draw a card. So even if I had 50$, it would not help me at all winning. So my suggestion is that each turn, there is a set of X-1 ( X=nb of players) cards in each category placed face up for the auction.

It seems this game could be played offensively and progressively, or it could be played defensively.  It is really a lot of work for what was projected to me as a "light game" and although the mechanics and game seem okay in and by themselves, it didn't really seem all that much fun to me.  Maybe it's just not my cup of tea.

RATING: 6
I can understand where people are coming from in that the game does sometimes get a little long and repetitive for what it is.  Despite all that, I still find it to be an enjoyable game that involves a fair bit of decision making and some confrontational play in bidding on an item that an opponent selected.  The start player has a lot of power to determine what a round will look like as s/he can pick 4 cards (in a 4 player game) from 3 different stacks and each stack allows a different and necessary function to occur.  Choosing not to make a card available from one of the three piles can effectively slow down an opponent but may also result in having that opponent make you pay for your card.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating after 2 player games only:Playing it with only 2 players works pretty well. I especially liked the different strategical possibilities that the play of special cards provide, making the game quite complex and suspenseful. The only downside is the time that it requires for what it actually is. However, this can be easily altered by lowering the amount of victory points that are required for winning the game.

a fabulous card game that looks more complex than it really is. You draw actions then everyone takes one or bids on one. If you receive money or an action you are done for that phase. Put goods in your warehouse (action), then sell to the ships (action).

You need to keep in mind what everyone else is doing so you don't give them the chance to get a leg up on you.

Loved it, and considering I sort of randomly purchased this, I am extremely happy with it.

After two games, I rate this a 5. I find it too long and repetitive. There is no progression, except that you may have a few cards saved between turns. You are not improving your capabilities, the ships do not develop or anything like that. Perhaps if you lower the goal, e.g. to 40 points for 3 or 4 players? Also, the cards are slightly dull and confusing. I´m not sure I´m going to keep my copy.

Seemed like I was always on a different part of the game (needing goods, warehousing, or shipping) than everyone else, so no one flipped the cards I needed.  When it was my turn I would take the card I wanted and inevitably someone would try to get the card from me, even playing the "this is mine" card on it.  A long, tedious, ultimately frustrating game with dark, depressing art.

6 rating based on one play.  I found the game a bit dry especially as we were playing with 1 very slow participant.  Three times during our three player game we were forced to take a storage card which we couldn't afford.  For some unfathomable reason, I couldn't find any rules which dealt with that issue.  I missed the answer in the rulebook...  

Even with the misplay, I certainly see scope for clever play and our game was extremely close with the winner scoring 51 pts and second place scoring 50 pts.  I bought this on the strength of the reviews in Counter magazine but I haven't seen the same light yet.

Ok  - so I reread the rules and the storage action is optional... this will make the game so much better... lol  I am sure my rating will go up from here.

Played three-player games, seven times, and a four player game, twice. I found the length of the four player game overstayed its welcome. Dreary and confusing artwork, the theme is quite strained in some places. Why do I pay to put goods in my own warehouse, yet pay nothing to put them on a ship I don't own? Somewhat tedious and over long with more than three players, and a silly name to boot.

A slow moving game where players draft/bid on cards to gain goods that will eventually be loaded onto ships and delivered.

It really comes down to timing and bidding just the right amount.

A játékban egy sajátos licit mechanizmus segítségével teszünk szert akció kártyákra, amiket végrehajtva tudunk árukhoz jutni, árukat elraktározni, majd a raktárunkból hajókat feltölteni. A játékot az nyeri, aki a hajók feltöltéséért járó pontokból elsőnek éri el a megszabott mennyiséget.

Downgraded from 8 after a few plays.  This game is paradoxically too long and too short - too long for the interest it generates, and too short to get anything meaningful done.  Between the excessive number of "special" cards and the small number of ships to be filled each round, there is too much luck and screwage to be able to plan.  A shame, since the artwork is really fine and the "extortion" mechanism is very interesting.

I was surprised how much I enjoyed this as it could be quite maths heavy, but I was able to play reasonably well on instinct. Feels like a more advanced version of Medici vs Strozzi, with more players and options. It plays a touch too long, but it didn't bother me as much as I'd normally expect. Maybe I was just in a good mood because barely themed guff like this normally makes me spew bile!

Az akciólapos licitálós kör ötlete egyszerűen zseniális. Adnék annak egy Béke Nobelt, aki ezt felvetette (nyilván nem, azt érdemelne utoljára). Ha ez nem lenne a játékban, szürke közepesnek értékelném, így viszont egy erős 8-assal indul két partit követően.

Ja, és csak ketten próbáltuk (eddig), bele sem merek gondolni, milyen kemény lehet négyen.

A játék röviden: kisebb és nagyobb méretű hajókra kell behajóznunk különböző árufajtákat. Három akcióféle van: áru(k) felvétele, behajózás/pénzhez jutás és raktározás.

A kezdőjátékos választ ebből a három típusú akcióból és felcsapja a legfelső lapot. Ezután választ akciót a felcsapottak közül, a többiek viszont rálicitálhatnak (ha akarnak) az akciókártyára, ha inkább nekik kell. Ilyenkor dönthet a játékos, hogy elfogadja érte valamelyik licitet, vagy ha nem, ő fizet valakinek a licitnek megfelelő összeget. Szóval garantált a kalamajka.

Az áru útja: előbb beszerezzük (kézbe kerül), majd onnan letesszük a raktárba (jó pénzért lehet ezt megtenni) és végül a raktárból lehet felpakolni a hajóra. Persze vannak spec. akciólapok, amik tovább fokozzák az izgalmakat.

Minden telepakolt hajó valamennyi győzelmi pontot ér (kisebbek 10 alatt, nagyobbak akár 18-20 pontot is). A játék akkor ér véget, ha játékosszámnak megfelelő GYP-t elérte valaki (két játékosnál pl. 60 pontot).

Egyszerű, nagyszerű, élvezetes. Megtartjuk.

Indigo Potter touts this as a good auction game for 2 players; I'm anxious to try it out.

Good first impression. Found that we were doing at least 1 rule wrong (you CANNOT keep basic action cards in your hand from turn to turn.) It's a potentially nasty little game of bidding, resource management and negotiation. I'd like to try it with more players.

My wife says "I like it more than that other shipping game." Which game is that? Le Havre.

Really an excellent, nasty game. I'm surprised it isn't rated higher. I guess because at a glance it looks like another generic eurogame about shipping. It's actually tense and full of interaction.

Played a 4-player game. Impressive as a first major release from the designer, but the game went a bit too slow for my taste, and I felt it overstayed its welcome in the end. Acquiring and shipping a good takes at least 3 turns  - getting the goods, loading to warehouse, and then shipping - if you not only get the right cards, but also have enough money to load the goods AND defend your card choice. Considering that the money can be very tight, I think this process will usually take somewhere between 4 and 5 turns, which, combined with 50-points goal, felt slow to me. Maybe having a separate source of income could have helped speeding up the game.

Reading through other reviews and comments, I guess our foursome did well on a first play (English Mayfair) of this challenging but repetitive auction game, only having gotten one rule wrong*, and a good time was had by all**

 * we allowed people who already acquired a face-up card to join in on bidding
** only I didn't like the game that much

-----
on a 2nd play, it's just an old curmudgeonly euro, can't hold a candle to any of the modern insta-classics (Glass Road, Madeira, Panamax, Grand Austria Hotel)... but there might still be a place for this "serious Knizia" type game... [size=4]just not in my collection[/size]

After two 3 player games of Before The Wind, I'm not quite sure what to make of it. First up, it's long, for what is essentially the same drafting / extortion mechanic. And yet I was fully engaged throughout. Perhaps it didn't seem repetitive because your individual game state kept changing, with your focus moving from one deck to the other.

The game is one of either providing viable options to other players so you can be left alone to do the one you want (especially if you're cash poor), or denying good options to other players (where you typically get stung for some cash). Choosing how far to go (ie how much cash to extort, or pay for that matter) is continually variable as people's fortunes and desperation change. I think this may be the key to the game's ongoing replayability. After all, extortion can be fun, but it can be painful if you get it wrong, so "responsible extortion" is the motto to live by.

I've seen a come from way behind win, so it's not a game of just efficiency. The luck of the cards can be crucial in determining whether you're moribund for a few turns or not. At those points you have just to suck it up, cash up, and wait your turn to strike. There's enough turns in the game that this should happen to everyone. One fear I have for the game is that it will often be so close at the end that it gets to be a luck-based win (eg you draw specials when you need to draw ship cards!). But we'll see. I also fear chaos in the 4 player game.

Really, really impressive first (?) game by Torsten Landsvogt. At first I wasn´t too excited about an almost pure card game (but there are more than 250 cards included). The graphics are very good, too. Although the actual rules are short (4 pages) the game is deep - to my mind a gamer´s game. I also like the "timing" tension; the fleet in the harbour will leave at a certain time so you need to find the right moment to transfer your goods to them (otherwise a large amount of goods will be rotten).

Takes a little getting use to, since it is not clear at first what everything is worth, but hang in there. After a few rounds, you can really start to see how good the game really is and how original some of the mechanics are. Can be frustrating while waiting for someone else to flip the type of action card you need, but this is under your control to some extent and even if you are stuck, you can always hinder others and steal their money. An impressive first game from Torsten Landsvogt.

This game felt really strange to me.  Each person chooses one item, and if someone else wants that item, they can make a monetary offer for that item instead of choosing their own.  You can either accept the money and give them the item, in which case you just get money, or you could pay them that amount, in which case they just get money.  I found that it was a little too easy to screw players out of what they needed, and spent several turns having my stuff snatched away from me.

Boy, is this game ugly. I was turned off by the graphic design and art, but there are some really interesting things happening. Players are collecting goods to ship them for points, in a race to a threshold of points. Each turn, the start player flips over a number of cards. She bids on one of them. Other players can then take that card and pay the first player the amount she bid, or take one of the other cards for free. If the first player wins the bid, she pays the bank the amount bid. This makes for some really interesting choices, wherein players are evaluating the value of a card not only for themselves, but for the other players at the table. My one play was two-player, and while it worked fine, I can’t help but feel that 3-4 might be even better.

I have only played it twice, that is why it isnt ranked higher yet. It probably will with repeated play. It is a really good game with a slightly dull theme... but I like cheese:-) This game is highly underrated and I think it would have gotten much more attention if they changed the theme and made a proper board game out of it instead of the card game it is now. And the warehouses.... is it a joke???

RATING: 6
Surprisingly interesting, somewhat evil game based around a brilliant bidding mechanism. Players race to go through various steps to get points, and take turns deciding which steps are up for auction. Tense, interactive, chaotic yet elegant, with plenty of laughs.

The game does drag. A lot. It would be hard to get everything lined up to score points even if you played it solo, and with every player trying to block you every step of the way it becomes a very difficult struggle. Powerful cards, unlucky draws or bad timing can set you way back.

You're spending a lot of time waiting for an opening, waiting for the cards to fall your way, waiting for a moment when your opponents are unable or unwilling to stop you from scoring. This 'waiting' isn't normally a problem, because you always have other things to do: hindering your opponents. It does result in repetitive play and a long playing time.

Ultimately, players are basing most of their decisions on what has the highest chance of hurting others and the lowest chance of hurting them, instead of what could be helping them the most. You have little control over your own situation.

I have fun playing this, and a lot of respect for the design. At the same time, I'm somewhat glad when it's over. It feel it will take a lot of effort to really get to know this game, and I'm not sure if it's worth it. I can't see it hitting the table often.

Before the Wind could have been an 8 or a 9; there's a lot to love here. But I simply can't see myself wanting to play this again, choosing it over other games. A long playing time and a lot of work, combined with lack of control and a repetitive feel kills it for me.

The action selection is interesting but very counterintuitive (you offered me 5 to buy my action? Nope, that other guy offered 3 so I'll pay him and keep it) but the main problem was that the game ran much too long. At 45-60 mins it would have been a fine, fairly interactive auction card game. At 2 hours (including rules explanation) it was a grind, and we actually called it after three rounds even though no one had quite reached 50 points (49 and 47 were the top scores). Would like to try again before I write it off though, there were some good ideas.

RATING: 5
One 3-player learning game. Felt like a longer and more difficult version of Splendor where the screwage is more blatant. The game plods along where too often I found myself 'in irons' with nothing useful to do due to a lack of money (and woe to you if the other players know this, you will get auction screwed over and over) and the intentionally limiting card draws by the other players. Add spoilage to this so that it becomes a grind to score points towards a finish that is satisfying only in that it is finally over. Not really what I want to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
At first glance - does not look very interesting. 
It uses a card drafting mechanism to get goods in hand, then to the warehouse, then to ships for scoring. The middle move requires money which is brought into the game from the shipping cards. 

The game is much better than it sounds. It is a tense game that provides quite a bit of player interaction, frustration and flexibility in your plans. You must be aware of your opponents needs and plans as you do your own. 
The play includes a lot of jostling for position and a wonderful extortion element. When it is your turn to choose an action card you may offer money to opponent instead - he then must pay you what you offered or surrender the card to you. Other players may offer less or more money as well. Sometimes you grab a card another must have so you can get money others to prevent an action. All this leads to EVIL game play - (evil in a good sense highly competitive rather begger thy neighbor).

As the start player you choose what cards are offered, opponent must have a shipping card and you don't oops that may not be offered. You really need a shipping card two may be offered and you take the one you think you can keep.

Which goods to collect? Do you go to beat another player to the punch and do the same goods? Do you go for different goods so you can ship elsewhere. 

There are quite a few decisions that you have to balance as the round progresses.

Looks to play well with both 3 and 4 players.

First impression:
One interresting game from Phalanx. There is a lot of interaction between players. You can easily screw up you opponents by bidding on the cards that you know they want baddly in order to steel the cards away from them or to gain money. You are always on the look out for your opponents next move. The rules are simple and well explained. The first two rounds can be slow but the paste will speed up the more you get familiar with the mecanics. One down side, the material is super but a little bit dark. The cards are easy to understand.

Première impression:
Jeu intéressant de Phalanx. Il y a beaucoup d'interaction entre les joueurs et vous pouvez cochonner vos adversaires en misant sur des cartes que vous savez qu'ils ont besoin afin de leur voler ou pour acquérir de l'argent. Vous devez vérifier en tout temps les actions des autres joueurs. Les règles sont simples et bien écrites. Les deux premières rondes peuvent être lentes mais le rythme s'accélère lorsque l'on devient plus familier avec la mécanique du jeu. Les cartes sont simples à comprendre. Seul point négatif, bien que le matériel soit beau, les cartes sont légèrement sombres.

Plenty of tricky decisions to make - take a card or bid for someone else's, select cards from the draw deck that others want in the hope they'll leave the card you want alone, or deny them useful cards.  Some reservations about what I found to be a slightly clunky and repitious scoring system where players lucrhed from one score to the next.  Still, the finish was tense and I'd definitely play again.

Rating after a single two-player test-drive.  I liked the game, though it's clearly not ideally suited to two players, so I'll want to get it on the table soon with three or four.  Our two-player game ran a little long, so I'm hopeful that it will run 60-75 minutes.  Though it wasn't apparent with two, the "white elephant" sort of system for getting the action cards seemed a bit like the one we recently experienced in League of Six, but maybe a little cleaner.  Again, it won't be obvious what this game really is until I play with more, but it's earned that chance.

Au départ, un jeu qui semble assez classique : on doit collectionner des ressources d'un certain type correspondant à la cargaison demandée par des bateaux prêts à partir.

On gère les marchandises en trois temps : pioche, rangement dans l'entrepôt, expédition, correspondant très naturellement aux trois paquets de cartes action.

Le mécanisme de pioche est d'une rare subtilité, et le système de négoce, calqué sur celui de [gameid=66], n'en est à ma connaissance qu'à sa deuxième utilisation dans le cadre d'un jeu. 

On termine par une durée et une interaction parfaitement équilibrées, et on obtient un jeu d'une rare qualité, et ce jusqu'au matériel : parfaitement dans sa gamme (taille de boite, prix, qualité des cartes), illustrations très classieuses.

Bref, tout bon.

RATING: 5
Runs perhaps a little long for a mechanic that repeats itself over and over again. Still, there are interesting decisions to be made and the game keeps you thinking without burning the grey matter to a frazzle. Reminds me of Ra in that you're bidding on goods, actions, special actions during your turn and all the while keeping an eye out whether the ships will be sailing before you get your goods in the warehouse/sail your own ships. Begs exploring further - I'm thinking that the extra playing time with four is worth it for the increased interaction - there's always the option of reducing the required points if you need a shorter game.

RATING: 5
I was specting more of this game.  Players are traders looking for victory points for putting their goods on ships.  To do so, they have to achieve the goods, be able to store them in their warehouses, and then load them into the boats.  The game doesn't have too much tension and it is very luck dependant.  It isn't very original, cause players get the constant feeling that they have done this before.

Before the Wind -- Played once; four-player.  I'd rate this higher if the end-game didn't feel so truncated.  It's "processional" feel (lack of beginning, middle, and end) was not really a problem when compared against the interesting gameplay (particularly, the thematic "rotting", and the card-claiming mechanic).  Our group's issue with the game was that when one person ends it, only one other can possibly pass that person.

Kereskedős, alkudozós, kihajózós játék a Before the Wind. Komor, minden kártya sötét, a hajókártyákon alig láthatóak a számok, de legalább a pénzek is kártyák benne. A kivitelezés nem igazán jött be. A játékosok árukat szereznek, azt elraktározzák, majd hajókra tetszik fel. A játék érdekessége a körönként szerezhető kártyák vagy pénzek. Mindenki választ a játékosok számától függően felfordított kártyákból vagy egy már más játékos által elvett kártyáért ajánl meg összeget. A kártya választója dönthet eladja-e annyiért vagy fizet érte annyit a pénz ajánlójának. Ezzel még nem is lenne gond, de ha több ajánlat van, ami akár megegyező is lehet, akkor a kártya választója dönt kinek fizet vagy kinek adja el a kártyát. Jaj, de rossz ez, a királycsinálást még nem láttam játékban ilyen nyíltan megjelenni. A játék a kvázi könnyedsége ellenére számomra túl hosszú is. Az másik játékossal való lapcsere kártya pedig az egész számítását áthúzhatja egy játékosnak. Kicsit úgy éreztem nem igazán tervezhetek előre, bárki elvehet adott árumat és semmit nem tudok behajózni. Nagyon nem jött be a játék, objektíven sem tartom jónak sajnos.

This is a game that has more to offer than meets the eye at first glance. The auction mechanism has such a nice special pinch to it, which makes it extremely interactive and challenging. We had a marvelous game with 3 players, which was really tense until the very end and we had a lot of fun "teasing each other".
I hope the author will have it reprinted with a completely different theme and maybe even as a board game.
Also I guess it will be not quite as good if only played by two players.

Finally someone decided to create a game that revolves near entirely around extortion.  Keeping that in mind, there is a real system here that is more than just drafting some cards that help you achieve your goals.  First as the overseer, or what ever you are as the start player you draw from three different decks that each control the types of actions that your fellow players can take.  This game is all about allowing others to move forward sub-optimally without punching you in the gut.  If you don't give other players what they need your selection will seem the best and then others can put you over a barrel or at least make things very expensive.

This is a beautiful system that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Certainly this is a tactical system, but you must have a plan. The card reveals are exciting and you must constantly re-adapt your strategies.  Much of this game is timing, figuring how to position everything to work, and walking gently, that and trying to foil other peoples plans as much as possible while helping yourself.  Up until now this kind of system would require a take that mechanism to create this kind of interaction, but the beauty of the bidding for another's possessions really make for an elegant and clean environment.

I should mention that the game is far from being short, but I was engaged all the way through it.  I'd imagine with three players the game would be a little shorter, but as the interaction was high and the options to play with kept me enthralled I felt it was worth the time.

I was disappointed that the preservation action didn't apply to towels. I know they don't spoil but I really wanted to make towel jelly.  Mmmm, Towel jelly.

I should also mention that the art direction on this is fantastic.  Everything is gorgeous.  Dark and stark, but really appealing, and clear.  Perhaps, I'm jumping the gun by giving it a 9, but I love this game. UPDATE: Still love it.

This is actually a pretty clever game and I like the theme.   It has served well as a game I can stuff into a baggie, throw into a suitcase and bring out in the hotel room when I'm visiting folks.  It's quick, fun and has just the right amount of "take that".

RATING: 6
1 play, 3er game. Probably better with 4? There are some interesting decisions here: which action cards to flip? how much to offer? Whether to accept money of pay it to keep your cards? when to play the special actions? how to time it so YOU are the one to get past the VP goal to end the game. Each turn moves along fairly quickly, but the game lasted too long -- 75 min. And with just 3 players, there didn't seem to be many choices during the trade actions phase (similar to 3er Oasis). 

The idea: obtain goods (from bank to your hand), place goods from hand to warehouse, and ship from warehouse to ships waiting in harbor. All driven by action cards, which are acquired in a sort-of auction. Ships accept particular combinations of goods and are worth 2-20 VP. Game ends when any player gets to 50VP (60 in 2er game) -- player with most VP wins.

I don't especially like card games. This one is fun enough for being played from time to time.

Simple auction game that should be played with 4 players only. It works pretty fine, it's easy to learn but it also drags a bit too much. A possibility is to reduce the objective of the game in points to reduce the time of play.

The artwork is beautiful although not very clear and functional.

Surprisingly good card game by Phalanx. The game presents you with clear logistic puzzles: purchase goods, store them in your warehouse and ship them. Except that other players also dictate whether you can buy, store or ship and may even outbid you.
There's a lot going on, which I like a lot. I just wish it was bit shorter than it is. This wants to be 45-minute game, but it usually goes on well beyond the 1 hour mark.

[u]Key Words:[/u] Trading & Shipping Goods - Card Game - Extortion mechanism - 2-4 Players - 1h

[u]Summarized Opinion:[/u] Not a bad game with an interesting extortion mechanism. Will not get played much as I'm lukewarm and the wife doesn't care for it much.

[u]My Rating Explained:[/u] Ok game, will play sporadically if in the right mood.

[u]Verbose Assessment:[/u]

This game had a really bad start because of some ambiguities in the [French] rules. We weren't sure how to play the special action cards which led to frustration. Once the good ole 'geek shed light on the issue we played it right, but it had already kinda soured the game on us.

It's basically a game about buying, storing and shipping goods (not an original theme, which doesn't help its cause), where the meat of the game is in the auction phase. Players can either reserve a card on offer that turn, or make an offer on another player's reserved card. That player then either accepts the offer, or [i]must pay the amount offered to that person.[/i] This is the 'extorsion' mechanism I mentioned in the key words. 

If you accept, you get the money, but no goods that turn. If you want to keep your goods, you have to pay up. Running too low on cash is a killer in this game as everyone can simply buy your stuff off you for a pittance.

My wife is as cut-throat as any gamer you can name, but she doesn't like the nasty tight-rope walking that is estimating values of goods in this game. Together with the bad start this game took, I'm not sure if I'm going to keep it, even if it's not a bad game in itself.

RATING: 7
Before the Wind is an interesting auction game because it forces you to decide between taking the largest value or taking a lesser value to deny someone the good they want.  It's quite a neat system of extortion which works very well.  The game isn't complicated, but there are a ton of cards to keep organized.

RATING: 5
This is a really tough one for me to rate. On the one hand, it's a clever, challenging and somewhat brutal (in the good kind of way that, say, Taj Mahal is with tough players - it forces some great competition). The auction/extortion mechanics, in particular, are pretty cool. However, with experienced game players prone to playing defense, this game seems to lock up, where nothing gets accomplished by anyone for long periods of time, especially if the ships that happen to come out all require a lot of one particular commodity. Between the swap goods and other special-action cards, some defensive play and a bit of old-fashioned stubbornness, Before the Wind can grind to a near halt, and we've easily doubled the advertised 75 minutes with just three players, not because of slow play but because of an inability for anyone to make any headway. In the end, although it's an interesting game, the tendency of Before the Wind to act like a ship in irons and stall out at times consigns the game to the trade pile and will almost certainly keep this from being played much.

Auction game = boring, although I must admit that the auction mechanic here is unique and interesting. (You can bid high or low on a card, and the active player may either pay the price to keep the card or take the money and give the card to you, and also the active player is not obliged to accept the best price, so there is a lot of room for decisions).

Another game by Phalanx and this basically means that it's got some really cool ideas behind it, a good theme, top notch production all wrapped up in a game that's at least OK. Seriously it's definitely original in some aspects but there does seem to be a bit of a lack of tension that I feel in a lot of their games.

I played a four-player game of this.  It's funny that it comes in the exact same box as Pingvinas but is incredibly deeper. I definitely enjoyed this one, and hope to try it again sometime... and am considering picking up a copy.  I'd like to see how it works with just 2 players, I'm curious how the bribing/extortion mechanic would translate, if it's like Goa then it should scale well. Interesting game that had definitely flown under my radar until now.

Excellent game. Simple rules, a lot of strategy. All the time, you need to be aware what is the value of new cards for other players vs you. Very clever bidding mechanism. Of course the game can suffer from analysis-paralysis if played with the wrong group of people, but in general it goes fast. The end of this game is a little "strange", but oh well ... the important thing is how you get to the end and not so much how it ends.

RATING: 6
Got for $3. Straightforward (conventional?) game where players need to get goods, store them, and ship them for VPs. Actions are restricted mostly by drafting of one card per player each turn. The start player of the turn draws from three decks (each deck corresponding roughly to a type of action) a total of one card per player, and he gets first pick.

The entire twist of this game is that a player can try to take an action card chosen by a previous player. Basically he offers some money, and that player must either take the deal, or pay the same amount of money to the inquiring player. In either case, the player who gets the money does not get a replacement card and basically loses his turn. So, there is real danger in offering too little.

A side-effect of this is a "poor stay poor" problem. If you run out of money, you cannot defend yourself from absurdly low offers. You'll have to take any offer that exceeds what you possess. That's interesting, but not really a good feature of the game.

So, I'd say basic strategy is that the start player draws cards from the piles so that he can get whatever action he is looking for, while the other players either get actions they can't currently use well, or else perhaps they get something designed to placate them and dissuade them from trying to steal what you want.

I didn't find this game very interesting, though it doesn't seem fundamentally flawed in any way. Playing this vs. Puerto Rico would be a close decision for me. But I'm not sure what justifies this game's existence and for that reason I only give it 6.5.

Also: The rules are quite unclear in places. The artwork is dark, and samey among the various decks.

...The game seems uninteresting because the decisions seem too straightforward; players' "positions" don't really change and long-term strategy is limited. I find myself wanting to answer why I rate this lower than Santiago de Cuba, and it might just be that BtW is more work to play.

Before the Wind is not a game for those that like to feel like they've accomplished a lot in a short period of time. This is a shipping game with no extraneous elements. There are some goods, and there are some boats, and you're going to spend up to 2 or 3 hours figuring out how to get a handful of goods on to those boats so you can win the game. There is a simple innovation on drafting which makes this a completely enjoyable process and great game however. The start player flips over one action card for each player from 3 action decks, and then those actions are drafted. However, you have the option of either taking an action outright, or making a bid on a previously taken action. Following players can make counteroffers, either higher and lower, and the owner of that action has to decide whether or not to take someone's money and give up the action, or pay a person to keep it. This simple system offers up a whole game's worth of difficult decisions and delicious player interaction. 

Sure, the name is silly, but it's the only downside. The art is great, the price is right, and the game is fantastic.

In most ways, this is your very basic Euro.  Turn up a limited amount of actions, and each player chooses one and executes it.  The hook with this one is that if you don't think any of the remaining actions are that good, you can instead select an action that somebody else has chosen and state a price for it.  That person either has to pay you that price to take the action, or give it to you for that price.  Very simple, but it works quite well.  Guilders (the currency) are always in short supply, and if you're not careful, it's easy to burn through them too quickly, and be left with no leverage to pay people to take actions.  

The game has good tension and lots of interaction, particularly for how Euro-ish it seems out of the box.  Much better with four than with three.  Unfortunately, there's something about it that doesn't quite work.  Every time I've played, it never quite clicks.  It feels like it got too stripped down, then additional gameplay elements got tacked back on, like the differences in spoilage, and the special cards.  The extortion mechanic should be great, but its just not [i]quite[/i] there.

Buy goods, store them in your warehouse, send them off on ships that match exactly for points.

Neat auction mechanic in that you can bid on an item that someone else has previously chosen. If they want to keep it, they end up having to pay you the price you were willing to purchase it for.

Not the greatest with 2 players, but I found it was still fun because of this extortion mechanic.

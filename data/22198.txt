Nice package, but nothing stellar on the game-play front, but then I've not played it often enough (and it didn't seem to work very well for two). But, like I said, very nice package, so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt for now...

RATING: 6
This Knizia card game is a light area majority game with some special powers and a good scoring mechanism. That being said, there is really nothing special about it. I will play again, but only with 3 players. 

I think if I had played this when just starting out with games, I would appreciate it much more.

Polish version "Pan tu nie stał (completely different theme). The theme (most importantly? + 0.5 to my rating), ease of play and fast pace of the game make for a very enjoyable experience. Bravo!

RATING: 7.5
Great Wall of China is a game of brinksmanship.  It's easy to get into a bidding war, and someone is always going to come along to prevent you being uncontested unless you can somehow table-talk them out of it.

The "special" cards go a long ways to making this game interesting.  Having sets of increasing power, being able to nuke an opponents card, and "depowering" all cards in a line provide interesting tactical decisions.

Somehow I always seemed to want tokens that others wanted.  Once you get behind or lose an expensive battle in this game, it seems like the pressure comes on to win one, which leads to more very expensive losses.  It is probably better to keep playing "against" the same person each time, trying to beat them, as you will both get worn down and so you are more likely to win rather than playing each round against a different opponent so they are always fresh.

From the Reviews: Why I haven't I bought this one yet I do not know, looks like a great, light, fast 2-5 player filler, which is just about a perfect thing for the Las Cruces Boardgaming group when we have several tables going on at once. Comments point to poor play with 2 players.

[b]After 5 plays:[/b]
This card game is one of the games that I cannot make an opinion about. It fails with 2 (it's mostly about the luck of the draw), but after 1 play with 4 I can see it becoming interesting (it turns tactical). I am waiting for more plays with more than 2 players, in order to have an opinion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game can get nasty: you have to know when to concede. Better with more players. But it's a really fun game. It feels similar to Samurai but lacks the annoying don't-play-second-to-last aspect. 

I love this game but nobody else does :(

Fun, short filler. Reminds me of Samurai. UPDATE 1: Not sure if this is worth keeping in the collection since it's really not memorable. I keep trying it out to see if it's worth it and then forgetting what I think about it. UPDATE 2: Yeah, definitely not memorable, and thus maybe not worth it. I've demo-ed this game several times and I still can't recall enjoying it! Nice card design backed by the Knizia name. UPDATE 3: Quick little 2-player game. 2015 UPDATE: If I have to keep reminding myself that I liked this one but not feeling motivated or interested to play it...

A neat game of hand management and efficient use of your resources (cards).  There are some nice tensions between picking up small rewards cheaply and fighting for larger ones, and around whether to deplete your hand to grab an opportunity now at the risk of losing out later.  The artwork in my Kosmos edition is merely functional and the card quality is not great.

I playtested this game.

{1 play, 4 players} Kind of a Samurai/Loot hybrid, but still its own game.  Once again Knizia mines his old ideas, mixes 'em around, adds stuff, and comes up with another solid game.  Rating may drop after more play, but I was really taken with it right out of the chute.

RATING: 6
the comparisons to samurai are valid.  compact box, simple rules, quick play, and it did fine with 5 players.  seems like it might go as well with less, although i like the idea of so many others being able to keep leaders in check with whatever they draw.  with 4 players you still play with the same amount of zones.  initially impressed with the game, but not so inspired for repeat plays.

Standard Knizia fare of mechanics with a theme for the cards and box cover. I feel that this one fails in that two players will end up either fighting over a set of tiles to the exclusion of others or simply avoid each other. A third player will get a free ride while four players can end up as two two player games.

RATING: 6
This seems almost like a re-theme of the game Loot, but with a few special cards added in.  Still I like this game better because of those special cards and the ability to do multiple actions in a turn.  The biggest drawback in the game is that some people (my wife and mother included) have issues understanding the way you can compete for the second tile in a wall section.  Subtracting the tile won from the cards played confuses the issue considerably.  I still enjoyed the game, though, and will definitely play it more.

Light fillerish-type game from Knizia and it feels like a Knizia game.  Just a bunch of cards and tiles with numbers, used creatively with a few of the cards being special.  Majorities win tiles for points.  Nothing special, but okay.

RATING: 7
Provisional rating - might change with more plays.

I don't really think this is that similar to Samurai - other than the theme. It feels more like Taj Mahal to me - you want to claim a wall (or suit in Taj) cheaply as possible and you really don't want to get into a battle with an opponent as you both waste cards (especially the loser). Quite like it as a quick filler - but I have reservations about the end-game, you can be in a kingmaker position where the cards you play at the end don't really help you at all but can have a negative impact on your opponents. The victory chits are hidden (but trackable for those who like that kind of mental challenge) - so possibly your choice could be based on improving your position ... 

*** Update - played it more, like it more, Kosmos version is much nicer than the FF one, although the card stock is thinner [so I got that version]

Personally, I like this game but I have pulled it out a two different occasions and no one has felt similarly.  Some of the mechanics are a little weird (hey, it is Knizia) but I like it as a filler.  There is enough strategy to make it a little interesting but there is also a significant amount of luck of the draw.

Adquirido en la bsk. Cambiado a Felo por un Alhambra (junto a un top race). Recibido el 8/10/10

Los jugadores compiten por unos marcadores de prestigio en la construcción de secciones de la muralla china. En su turno el jugador hace tres cosas: 1º comprueba si recibe algún marcador, 2º juega o roba, 3º juega o roba (excepto caballería). Cuando juegas cartas, se puede jugar cualquier numero de ellas, siempre que sean iguales.

Reglas sencillas, pero algo de chicha. Es muy knizia.

Cambiado en Nov2011 en la bsk a jankovicz, junto al catán de dados y el BoomTown, a cambio de un Battleground para jugar con Alejandro. Me dió un poco de pena deshacerme de él.

Pretty light but with an unintuitive mechanic for winning the scoring tiles. I didn't find this to be much fun as how well you do is all down to who decides to pick on you and if you get into a fight for the tiles and others are unopposed, they'll do much better.

A surprisingly good little Knizia filler. 

The theme is...as usual, not terribly strong. But who cares?

The components are nice. Good quality cards with evocative art. 

This game feels a lot like Samurai, in a quicker and tighter package. If you could draft your starting hand it would feel even MORE like Samurai. 

Still, I'd rather just play Samurai, but for something easily portable and playable in a short time span, this is a good choice. I'd be willing to play any time.

I can't believe I waited to try this. I really like this game. To me it hits the perfect balance of fairly quick card game that's easy to explain, but has interesting choices/decisions (along with games like High Society and For Sale). It captures the battle element from games like Taj Mahal and Condottiere and boils it down into a tasty nugget. And it has a great unique machanism, in how the "first" winner of a battle gets to choose one of the two point tokens for the battle as a prize, but can still compete for the 2nd token as well, but his strength is now reduced by the token he selected. Which means that he can take the big one and go home happy, or be greedy and take the smaller one, thus reducing his forces less, and hoping to still be strongest even after the reduction to claim both tokens (also the remaining larger token). Watch out for the big fights! While bickering over a wall section, others can snatch up multiple smaller sections for very little investment! As a bonus, plays very well as a two player.

RATING: 4
The first game I played this wasn't a success, and I immediately sold on the game as a consequence. The second time I played it, some years later, I realised I had been a little too hasty. It's not quality stuff, but it's not as bad as I had previously thought. It's a numerical game, totally in line with Knizia's famed lack of subject matter, where players try to 'influence' two point tiles, but can only claim them if they still hold the most influence at the beginning of their [i]next[/i] turn. It's a simple scheme which might have been interesting if it allowed for more complex protection patterns (as for example seen in Reef Encounter), but regrettably that is not the case in GWoC. What players draw from their personal draw decks influences their tactics considerably, and those cannot be planned for... until the game nears its end by which time seasoned card counters might have the advantage. But at the same time you might be too late to change your position for the better in a decisive way.

In summary: better than I remembered it, but not by much. Still, the game's rate earned 1 point.

If you cannot let go of sunk costs, you will lose this game by getting in a huge, unproductive battle over too few points to matter. But if you consistently are willing to abandon sunk costs, you will lose this game to those playing more aggressively.

Having an idea of the distribution of point tiles is rather important; it's frustrating for newer players if they fight hard for 4 points only to see 7 and 8 point tiles come up once their hand's depleted.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Components: Functional tiles. Nice cards with clear iconography.

Experience: Not terribly engaging with two players, but I'd be willing to try it with more. There is a certain satisfaction to the two actions, and being able to play sets of cards. I enjoy the mechanism by which a player's total is reduced by the value of their claimed tile.

RATING: 4.5
The game play is somewhat interesting once you've taken the time to get past the initial unintuitive rules.  I expect a bit more simplicity from a two player game.

My wife strongly disliked the game at first.  There were too many confusing elements.  She kept forgetting that the first token taken counts as a negative towards your point total.  She kept forgetting when to check to see if someone could claim a wall.  She also did not see much interest in the game play.

I somehow convinced her to play 2 more times.  After each play, she stated that she would not be unhappy to never play the game again.  I wanted to get past the initial strangeness of the rules to see how the mechanics worked.  We've played three times now, and Karen still has no desire to ever play it again.  I could play it a few more times.  There are some interesting things at play, but the game is not interesting enough for me to recommend others to get past the strangeness of the rules.

RATING: 7
Players represent overseers during the construction of the great wall of China.  Each player plays with an identical deck of 30 cards.  The cards represent a section of the wall (in their colour), along with a value and possibly some sort of special ability.  On a turn, players take two actions - an action can be to draw a card, or play one or more identical cards against a wall section.  Each section has two victory point chips on offer (valued between 1 and 8).  When a player begins their turn, they check to see if they have a simple majority in card value on that wall, and if so they can claim one chip.  When both chips are claimed, a new wall section is begun.  The catch is ... the first chip claimed counts negative against that players cards for scoring of the second chip.  Delicious problem - what do you do with a 1/7 split - take the -1 and try for the 7 as well... ?  Typical Knizia - very simple but tends to make the brain ache a little.  Samurai with a pinch of Taj Mahal, wrapped up in a tiny box.  Good game.

It seems to be very good for two people but might be even better for three or four.  The directions seemed to be overly complex and/or not well written, but they start to make sense as you play. My only complaints are that you spend a lot of time recalculating the score on each wall and with two people you often end up with a pissing match on one wall because of a large point spread on the tiles.

Reminds me a little bit of Condottiere.  Haven't played this enough and with what I would feel to be the ideal number of players.

Score could increase with more plays.

A very interesting area control card game. Simple to play and comes handily in a small box. Classic Knizia with lots of interesting decisions to make and deep strategising and second-guessing. The theming is good as well: placing the cards in rows which form walls and the victory point chips, with the Chinese characters "jiang shang", which means reward. A very nice touch. UPDATE: Slightly disappointed that the FFG version does not have the "jiang shang" characters. It has "di guo" (empire) instead.

Yet another Knizia filler, with a winning dispostion.  Player count seems like it would change the game some - I thought it worked pretty well with five.

Too short, but otherwise fine, although not up to some of the Doctor's other fillers.

Another tight simple numbers/majority-scoring game from Reiner Knizia, with some simple special actions thrown in. The only fun I got from this game was the table talk. One reason I'm down on it is because we played a 3player game, and I think it fails there. Players A & B fight each other, Player C cleans up. The game itself was very limited, very restricted and not exciting at all. It was as if Reiner pulled a bunch of mechanism from a bag, sorted them into a game, tweaked the numbers so it was tight and let it go. Not bad, not awful, but not much fun either. The theme was irrelevant, the graphics okay. But I would try this again with 4 or 5 players, it's not poison. *** Blimey, how one forgets! It shows how anodyne and unremarkable this game is, I totally forgot I'd played this before. Played as a 2p game today, just as dull. it's just another Knizia scoring mechanism with a theme tacked on. My Kosmos edition has flimsy cards too. I'm going to down-rate this from 6 to 4. Ye ghods.

Rating based on 1 play.  I'm not sure how I feel about this one.  I like the character's special abilities.  Yet... something left me feeling a little cold.

Update:  I liked this when it was new, but today I'd rather play other things and it never comes out.  It's forgettable.  Rating went from an 8 to a 6.

I really like this card game.  It does feel like a card version of Samurai and it benefits from a quicker set up.  Of course it doesn't look as beautiful as Samurai...  It's a winner and I like the fact that it can work with 2 to 5 players.  I also enjoy the separate draw decks.  It's simple but tense and loads of fun.

Quiero darle más partidas y ver cómo evoluciona, pero en principio me ha gustado. Tiene tensión y decisiones complejas. Un auténtico Knizia de los que tienen muy pocas reglas y más profundidad de la que se presupone en un principio. Su defecto es que quizás sea algo árido.

Even a euro fan has a bias against loosly pasted on settings and theme.

Not a bad game, but like other Knizia card games (Knights of Charlemagne comes to mind) this one is pretty ho-hum.  Is it as good as traditional card games like hearts and spades...I think not.  After a 2nd play...I'm warming up to this one a bit (I tied for first in a four-player.)  I couldn't pass on GWoC at 75% off at Barnes and Noble.  I gave my copy away to friends in San Antonio after teaching them the game.

I can certainly see where the "Samurai - the Card Game" comments come from; in play it reminds me of Taj Mahal where it is easy for 2p to get involved in a fight to the death.

While the game wasn't too exciting with 2 players, I can see this being a good game with 3.  The special cards give the game just enough variety to save it from being another bland Knizia design, and I like that you only play through your deck once.  The artwork and production is nice.

One play with two, two plays with three. A distant relation of Knizia's Samurai, with a hint of Scarab Lords. It's a little more involved than most Knizia card games, and it packs a nice punch for the amount of time it takes. The key rule is that you can play multiples of a particular type of card in one action; this means that the bigger your hand is, the more power you have, but if you spend too much time drawing cards your opponents may be able to win tokens cheaply. It's not a heavyweight, but there's more game here than the small box would suggest.

The three-player game was better than the two-player game, I think, but I'd like to try it again with two sometime.

Fun little filler game that gives everyone the same deck of cards (but obviously, the cards come up in a different order for each person). It's all about optimally using those cards,  managing your hand so that you constantly have cards to play, and not overstretching yourself (i.e. using too many cards to capture points), while letting other players capture points while using relatively few of their cards.

Played once with 2 and once with 3.  I thought it was great.  I love the different card effects, and the bluffing you can pull off (pike-men are a good deterrent).  I also like the hand management aspect, and the way the noble and dragon cards and make several 1 cards more powerful than a 3.  I also like the timing involved, knowing when to pull out you big guns to grab the high points.  I think it's important to not get hung up on conserving your cards, rather you should be trying to burn through them as fast as possible to end the game.  As far as a kingmaker situation, we played with victory points face down, so unless you're tracking that information, I don't see how that's a problem.  I guess if one player decides to fight with another and leaves the third player alone, you basically hand the game to the third player, but that's not the games fault.  I rate it an 8 as a filler after 2 plays, and it was surprisingly good with 2.

Very good game but I'm disappointed with the Fantasy Flight version although others thought I was crazy. I like the Kosmos version, especially considering how much we are paying for a rather cruddy Chinese production. Fantasy Flight usually rises above those issues and pulls it off. But the game itself makes it worth it. You've got to really struggle hard where to choose your battles and where to cut your losses and take the lesser token, if your lucky enough to still get it. Very Knizia and very good.

1 Play 2 players  Solid 2 player game, but I suspect it plays entirely differently with more players.  With two players you might as well just play with open scoring as it is very easy to track differences in points.  Also, with two players, it is really a matter of tracking the cards your opponent plays.  Seems extremely similiar to Sumo (an online variant of En Garde by Knizia)  With more players, this would become harder to keep straight (points and cards).  Should be a good filler, suspect that this rating will go up.

Lo adquirí para rellenar un pedido de Alemania y me arrepiento de no haberlo estrenado hasta ahora. El juego fluye sólo con leer las reglas. Podría decirse que es un “Samurai: el juego de cartas”. Buen filler, aunque algo flojo para 2 jugadores (prefiero Battleline). Más sencillo que Colossal e Ivanhoe. Buena idea la del mecanismo de reclamación del primer marcador de puntuación (te resta influencia por si pretendes reclamar el segundo). Así te cuesta más y favorece al jugador que va perdiendo. Claro y asequible para los no iniciados.

1st played 11/01/2007. Takes <10min to be taught and ~30min to play for 3. Each player is dealt a hand of 5 wall(1)/gate(2)/tower(3) cards from their personal deck of 20. Cards are worth 1-3 points. Special cards: Noble(1) makes all cards of value 1 in that row. Dragon(1) covers another card. Calvery(2) does not cost an action. Infantry(1) is worth more with multiples. I.e. 1=1, 2=3, 3=6, etc. There are three prestige rows (two tiles/row) which to build your wall cards. Prestige value range from 1-8. You decide which prestige row to win. If you have a majority at the begining of your turn, you chose a tiles and place it on one of your cards. This causes your card to be minus the tile value making it harder for you to get the 2nd tile in this row. Once both tiles are claimed then the row is cleared and tiles are disperse to winners for scoring and new tiles are placed. Next you can take two actions. Draw a card or place as many like cards in one row. Either can be done twice. Game ends either with last tile or card drawn. One last round is finished and tiles only count if off walls. The balance of luck/strategy seems to tilt to the luck with conflicts between some players can leave others the victory. Worth a play, however I wouldn't recommend it for purchase.

Jun08: And another near miss from Knizia.  I may try it again, but it's just not doing it for me right now.  We played one game with a full compliment of 5 players.

The decisions were meaningful, but it felt like too much of your fate was in the hands of the other players.  If they let you have points, then you got points.  Most of the game I just spent trying to get cheap points where other people wouldn't fight me.

I do really like the "drawing is an action" rule and think it needs to be in more games.  In the end though, I almost think I have to give the nod to Samurai as my favorite of Knizia's "Influencers".  I really like the spatial reasoning aspect, and King's Gate just has far too many exceptions and horrible art work.

Though it's not a traditional "trick-taking game," and it removes one of my favorite mechanisms(turn order conflict), I find the addition of the option to fight over multiple tricks that vary between high/low risk/reward options, and fighting for them over multiple rounds in a game of chicken to be more interesting than standard fare. There is a potential for strategy that most trick-taking games lack.

Bokkensprong, 16/03/12 met Ward (7j), Victor (10j) en Roel. Roel is halverwege gestopt, waardoor we het spel niet helemaal konden uitspelen. Misschien is het spel leuker als het wel kan worden uitgespeeld.
Eigenlijk een kaartspelletje met stukken Chinese muur met punten op, Chinese krijgers, paarden, etc. 
Twee acties per ronde, vb. 2 kaarten spelen, 1 kaart spelen en 1 kaart nemen, of 2 kaarten nemen. Wie in een van de rijen ("muren") aan de leiding staat, wint een puntentegel (die wordt afgetrokken van de waarde van de rij).

As a three player game, this is susceptible to two people fighting it out over one scoring tile while someone else cleans up elsewhere. But that's a failing of strategy, not the game, and I think the mechanics are really quite fun.

I'll pass on this one.  All of what I hate about area majority without the same kind of interesting decision-making that an El Grande has.  I'm almost never in the mood for a game which revolves exclusively around confrontation without giving me the opportunity to build anything.  Win or lose, and I've done both, I'm not in a good mood after playing this game.

At heart it's a Knizia auction game sharing elements with a number of his other designs (hello Samurai!), but it still works well. Plus (being a card game) it's portable - just the ticket for shoving in a rucksack or cycle pannier bag.

Play cards to build "walls" and claim points if you dominate.  Decisions involve: 1) the trade-off between claiming the high or low scoring token first for each wall. 2) Deciding how much to invest in any wall rather than build to another. The "special power" cards are well thought out and add enjoyment. Card counting crucial, if that matters to you. A good game, but missing that "je ne sais quoie" that makes you crave it. I like the similar Blue Moon City and Samarai better.

This game needs at least one play to get a grip on the distribution of victory points and knowing when to go for a fight and when to settle for second place. Rather aggressive card game which will suffer from inattentive or kingmaking players when taken serious. It lacks something unique to make me want to play it again but I wouldn't oppose another try.

A very intriguing trick-type game. You check each trick at the beginning of your turn, like in Loot. The deck composition has just enough going on to make for interesting play. Feels almost like push-your-luck, except that your luck is determined by the other players choices. Overall I get a feel similer to Coloretto, which is one of my all-time favorite short games. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Yet another light Knizia filler that offers some interesting decisions.  There are many things that seem familiar from other Knizia games.  The cardplay reminds me of Ivanhoe and even Taj Mahal, in that it can be costly to get into a battle over one little token.  The way that your lead must remain until your next turn actually reminds me of Easy Come, Easy Go.  The numbers from 1 to 3 influencing certain targets can't help but remind me of Samurai.  But it's fun to see how such a simple idea and such a narrow variety of cards can come together for an engaging game.  I'm not sure why they changed the artwork from the Kosmos version, it seemed perfectly fine to me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A bit of Taj Mahal and Samurai in a card game. It sounds really good (I like both those games), but there's just no competition in the game. Its too dependent on the card draw. There isn't enough room for clever card play.

Note: FFG's version is a horrible step backwards compared to Kosmos. Kosmos cards have "meaningful" symbols on the cards identifying its special ability. FFG's is just terrible.

It's a typical Knizia card game like Schotten Totten, Tabula Rasa or Lost Cities. At the same time, it works like a somewhat lighter cardgame version of the combination of Taj Mahal and Samurai. Nothing really new but it doesn't mean it doesn't work very well. (update: it's 'not bad' with 2 but a lot better with more. The rating is for 3 or more players.)

[2008.Feb.19] Another Knizia tile laying-like game. The good Doktor always seems to know how to constrains each player's actions, so that everyone always seems to be just 'one more action' away from pulling off that killer play. Simple-to-play, hard-to-win.

This game is a classic Knizia brain burner, though I don't strictly mean it in the sense of a compliment. The idea is great, and the mechanism is clever, but it really takes a few plays to get your head wrapped around all the intricacies of the strategy.

RATING: 6
We're always looking for another [GAMEID=50], an enjoyable light "airport" game.  When we saw [GAMEID=22198] during the Barnes and Noble sale, we picked it up.  Being a Knizia card game, this seemed like a natural cousin to Lost Cities.  The Asian theme was also a plus and the cards and artwork were great.

Although I explained the rules from the book, she had a hard time understanding it until I explained it as an auction game where you're bidding for each point tile.  In that way, the game made much more sense to her than the straightforward mechanical explanation in the rule book.

However, the game just didn't work for us with two player.  I guess auction games typically don't really work for just two players, so maybe it's not too surprising.  Since there are only two different groups of tiles to bid for in the two player game, and you can play on both, luck plays a big factor---the game usually falls to whoever gets the better cards.  This game probably plays much better with more than two players---with more tiles in play (but still being limited to two to bid for), there are a lot more chances for strategic cooperation or conflict between different players.  There are more chances to try and sneak onto some tiles while the other players are distracted.

A surprisingly good game. I acquired it almost by accident and couldn't really imagine how the game flows by reading the rules alone... After playing it, though, I must say that this is another example of good Kinzia-design - sure, the mechanics aren't very original, but the game is smart and plays like a far less chaotic Condottiere. I like it!

A Reiner Knizia game, but not one of his better ones.  You are playing cards competing for point tiles and you need to be in the lead at the start of your turn.  You can let select a tile which reduces your power, but you can keep trying to take tiles and commit to one group.  When both tiles are taken, the cards are cleared and new set of tiles are set out.  There are special cards with different powers.  

I found the game boring.  I would play as it is over relatively quickly but there are a lot better filler games.

Great Wall is one of my favorite filler games, although I haven't played it enough to fully appreciate it yet. The mechanics are different, the play time is appropriately quick, and it features a good level of player interaction.

I particularly enjoy the dynamic of not knowing precisely when to go all-out and commit to a particular wall entirely, and when to sacrifice your investment in favor of mitigating your losses. For a quick game, the turn angst quotient is good.

Played four three-player games.

Never get involved in a land war in Asia, they say. Competition is bad for everyone involved, and there doesn't seem to be any good ways to avoid it. The combination of hideously expensive resources and a harsh punishment for being outbid, either arbitrarily or because you're in the lead, doesn't appeal to me. Compared to the vaguely similar Taj Mahal, this system feels one-dimensional and more masochistic than fun.

Really neat filler. If Battle Line is Knizia's take on Poker, this felt like his take on Rummy. There's a bit of an area control element, but I like that you're able to play sets of the same cards so long as their rank is the same. I'm surprised that this one doesn't get more love, as it's actually a pretty fun little game. Lots of tension between going hard for walls with a lot of points, or spreading yourself out and hoping for a piece of the pie. Highly recommended.

RATING: 6.5
Each player has a deck of cards ranging from values of 1 to 3. Pairs of chits, containing VPs ranging from 1 to 8 are flipped up. Players compete by playing down cards to gain control of the chits. The only trick is that the chits are not awarded until both can be taken. The person taking the first chit with the higher value of cards will then have the chit's value deducted from their card's value. The cards also have special abilities, such as covering up an opponent's card, or taking another turn. Quick and fun filler. 

The mechanics are fun, and it is a clean game. As a strategy game, you may get picked on by other players in competition for chits. You could argue, well, then try for lesser value chits. But with a large number of players, no one is going to let you have anything for free. May work best with 4 players, and could be crowded with 5 players.

Very interesting little Knizia game, a card game area control. Can get cut-throat once people have invested too much pride and cards in a single row - heart beats head. The game's a bit too dependent on luck of the draw but good all the less as a filler.

Lame filler that seems okay until you get to the horrendous endgame, which can easily result in lots of points being given away for practically nothing after 40 minutes of intense squabbling over smaller amounts.

RATING: 5
Like almost all Knizia games, it is and it feels totally abstract. Like almost all Knizia games, it works and it is not a bad game, but also like almost all Knizia games, it's nothing special.

It packs though a bit more meat than the average filler. Sadly, the lack of theme, the poor production and the gameplay will not make it a popular choice. 

My biggest issue with it: it promotes running away from conflicts.

It reminded me of [thing=112]Condottiere[/thing], but it is not nearly as fun.

Quick, fun, relatively easy to get into. Runs into the problem of being almost too light and quick and yet not being a casual non-gamers beer and pretzels game.

I want to like this more than I do. The gameplay feels about right, and has a solid, if typical Knizia-ish, ruleset. But I just can't see the game in it yet. I'm willing to give it plenty more chances, though; surely you need a thorough grounding in the card powers and distribution to make the most of the game?

RATING: 6
I think the rules are well written but not well organized. I checked the Fantasy Flight website to find two errata in the rules book, plus a helpful illustrated example of play. Then played two games by myself to "get it." 

I can definitely see that this is a game that's more interesting with upwards of 5 players: 2 is too limited. 

A "medium-well" Knizia design. Reminds me of "Knights of Charlemagne," a game I prefer because it plays well with three players. 

At the same time I find it rather dry to play and in that way too indicative of other Knizia designs (or others in a similar vein). On that basis I prefer "Knights of Charlemagne," for example. 

Bought in July 2007 and later sold.

Play cards against score tokens and hope you're in the lead by the time it gets back to you. It feels like Taj Mahal lite - ie don't get into wars with anyone if you want to do well - blended with Samurai with the special card abilities. As a filler it's fine.

Based on one play: Build a wall where you have the most parts. It is player versus player, but the goal is to have the majority of the wall on your turn. Plays well, not a huge amount of strategy. Worth a try.

Interesting game. Players add cards to four segments of the Great Wall, and can claim points if they have the best contribution to the segment at the start of their next turn. However, previously claimed points count against the worth of the contribution.

RATING: 7
On first play, all four players strongly appoved of this game. 

It consists simply of five color-coded twenty-card decks of cards (one for each player), and some chits, no more.  Knizia knows how to create a card game. Strategy is deep (I think).  A great small-box Knizia.

BTW, this is [i]nothing[/i] like Samurai in actual play.  There are critical differences.  In Samurai you know exactly how many spaces surround each figure. In Great Wall you can keep fighting, probably uselessly, for some chits.  This changes everything: you must know when to withdraw.  It seems to have been developed from Loot.  It is much more interesting than loot, and easier to play also. The five decks clarify ownership of cards in play, and the double chits making decision making more difficult.

RATING: 7
OWN Jan/07: unplayed.  After trial run, it definitely has a feel of Samurai in the limited, same-deck cards, and the abilities of those cards.  However, the progress checking feels more like Taj Mahal (am I winning RIGHT NOW?).  The token claiming (with negative points assigned from 1st one, to handicap further chances on the 2nd, and to probably push someone else into the lead now) is just completely new to me.

TRY Feb/07: Liked it on first try (4er; learning game).  Rating may go up.

RATING: 6
The two player game felt kind of unexciting. The three player experience proved to be much more interesting though. With more than two players one must pick one's fights and passive aggressive card play forcing other players to act comes into play.
As has already been pointed out, the experience when playing Great Wall of China carries many similarities to a simplified version of Taj Mahal. Mechanically it's different and simpler, but the effect is somewhat similar.
As a simple card game, Great Wall of China is a nice filler.

Basically it's Samurai: The Card Game in which, instead of "bidding" for one or two Plexiglas figures, you are bidding for one or two numerical cardboard chits. The innovative catch-up mechanic is that the highest value chit is a)subtracted from the winning bid (making it difficult for that bidder to claim the second token)and b) placed on one of the winner's wall cards to prevent opponent's dirty card play of the dragon wall. As befits the theme the play is linear so lacks the subtle spatial considerations and visual attractiveness of its predecessor.

A quick and decent new Knizia card game. Reminds me of Samurai, and I even think this was an attempt to produce a card game version of Samuria. But don't expect much similarities and don't expect anything as great as that game.  However, as a quick filler it is very good - creates tension and provides interesting and sometimes not so easy decision making. I think it is best with 3 and gets too chaotic with more.  I've not played it with 2.

I put this in the same category as games like Coloretto and Poison, but it's better than both of those games, although I don't think it scales to 4-5 players as well as either of those two games.

I played this game before I tried Samurai. Now that I've given both a shot, I keep thinking of Great Wall as Samurai's Mini-Me. Maybe it's the Oriental theme, but the cards just seem to say "Samurai! Samurai". It's fun nonetheless, and it stands on its own well.

RATING: 6
Good example of a Knizia-by-numbers game. Solid scoring mechanic, like all Knizia releases, but very light and not a whole lot of interesting decisions to be made. This is OK for a family card game, but it is rather dry too. Only played with three, but with five I could imagine the constant counting may get a little annoying. Like T&E card game, it isn't overly elegant, but at 30 mins it makes for an interesting, if unspectacular diversion.

Knizia's take on Condottiere. A solid filler, and a good addition to the increasingly impressive FFG silver box range. But, I can't imagine why anyone would buy this over Condottiere from the same range.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Sort of a one long hand of Condottiere but everyone has the same deck of cards - which might be better, or might not. Fairly enjoyable, but game final round ending needs to be modified - otherwise a big advantage to the player to the right of the player who first went out by using all their cards. I like the small package and it plays in a good amount of time. Worth the effort really because it does what the game intends to do - provide fun with player interaction in a reasonable amount of time with low level thinking, but with some decent decisions to be made. Not bad at all.

Played this game yesterday.  It was quite fun.  We played with 5 players, and had a number of people fighting over very long walls for 8 points, and had a few people slip through the cracks to grab a 6 point wall for almost nothing.  

We have played this game a number of times now, and our strategies are evolving.  We have people playing for the low point token in an attempt to collect both, people drawing HUGE hands of cards and playing for the end points, and people trying to sneak in to grab little 3's and 4's here and there.  This is a hugely popular lunch game right now.

Shades of Rummy and Coloretto in here, but this really is a trick-taking game, albeit with multiple tricks in play. My first play was enjoyable, and this is shaping up to be a solid filler. This game seems very dependent on you keeping the player on your left in check, and metagaming this.

Cardgame with a Loot/Coloretto feel to it. The choice is often whether to pursue points for yourself or upset someone else from getting cheap points.

My rating is based on two player games. These seem to work, until you get to the endgame, where whoever gets to play last will get a huge advantage.

Yay!  Finally a Knizia game I like again.  It feels like it is a rare treat when it comes around.

This has a fun system that pushes players against each other.  I like games that fight on multiple fields and this does it nicely in a small package. I like the small acts of aggression.  Sometimes you get silly and fight too much giving everyone else a lead.  Much of the game is knowing when to bail out, and that makes for some fun choices.

RATING: 6
1 play. Each player has an identical set of cards numbered 1-3 (I think), some of which have special abilities. Start with a hand of 5 cards. Randomly draw 2 pairs of scoring chits. On your turn, either draw a card of play. If you play, you may play either a single card, or a set of like cards (of any number). Cards are played next to one of the pairs of scoring chits. At the [i]start[/i] of a future turn, if you have the majority of points, you may claim one chit. However, the claimed chit then counts against your total if you're trying to claim the second chit of the pair! [Our game gets an asterisk - I was apparently not clear to Mary about this key rule!] When both chits are claimed, you randomly draw another pair. Continue play until one (or was it both?) player plays all his cards. High score wins.

This was a pretty nice game where you push each other into overcommitting; you have to constantly decide on when to give up on a chit or two. Unfortunately our first play was marred by a rules issue, so I'd like to try it again. For now, just a 6/10 but would likely go up.

The order of play can be too much important but I still like it enough to play it time to time because it's quick, it has some good tactic and stratecic feeling. It has luck involved and that's something we should be aware of when playing it.

A bit like Samurai in tis points-based area control mechanic but without the 6-space limit inherant with the hexes.

Quite intense with 2.  Good with 3, and has some very tricky decisions with 3 since there are often times when someone has to decide to get out of a bid war--which is painful because you've committed good cards, but if you can do it at the right time, it can often be the biggest step toward a win.  

With 4 or more (why?) I grow rapidly less interested in playing because the landscape will change far too much between your card plays, which in turn means the game becomes more and more random and uncontrollable.  Your plays mean little because you probably wont have any effect over anything specific once you drop your card(s). yuck!

Small footprint means even if you don't play all the time (and I dont really think there's enough here to play that frequently) you can still easily keep the game for the times when you want to play.



Fun game!

I really liked this game.  It is set up sort of like Samurai meets Taj Mahal, with players using the pieces from Samurai to play chicken for pieces like in Taj.  I tend to be good at this kind of game, so that may influence my decision, but I liked this game a lot.  There is great tension in trying to gain the tile that you have already put resources into getting.  Like Taj, knowing when to pull the plug on an endeavor is key.  The aesthetics are nothing special, and the concept is a bit dry, but the game itself is well put together for a short, tension-filled game.

[FFG 06 Edition] {China; bidding; optimal 3-4p} GWoC is another nice tactical card game from Knizia.  It is somewhat similar to Loot! in that players need to smartly decide whether to withdraw or to continue an attack.  GWoC is easy to explain: simple rules, easy scoring rule and only 4 function cards. The price is reasonable given the packing, card quality and tokens. A minus is that the pasted theme makes little sense.

GWoC is not brain-burning even though players have to make correct decisions because they only have 20 cards to play.  Maintaining a good balance of hand is quite important; many players lost in GWoC because they used up their hands too soon and then have only 1 or 2 cards to play each turn.

I admire the way Knizia designs function cards; he can usually add function cards to an ordinary card game to make it more fun, tactical without destroying the balance.

Nonetheless, I think GWoC is embarrassing for the target audience.  Gamers will find it too chaotic to control and general players will find it too dry to play.  It is a solid game but it is not great fun and it sometimes is dry.  It is deeper than Loot! and Circus Flohcati but I think those games are better choices as a family card game.  It will not be a special game in my collection. However, I would keep it because I like China-theme games. I like the illustration of cards, which is attractive.

After playing a handful of 2 player games this felt like one of the worst Knizia games that I had   bought. Most of the time it's a no brainer about which option to choose. I also dislike the way players can continually slog it out adding cards to swap the lead before someone gets a lucky draw to win the round. Balloon cup is a much better game that for 2 players. There was much more decision making in the 4 and 5 player games that I played afterwards but I feel this game is still lacking enough depth or control.

A Knizia style card game by Knizia, the theme is pasted on, but in this case quite OK. It does feel a bit like a card version of Samurai. I'm a bit unsure how to rate this yet because our first game was rather slow, but it looks like a strong 7/weak 8.

This little card game has some similarities to both Samurai and Loot, yet is different enough to have a distinctive feel. It has the nice quality of being just heavy enough without burning your brain. And unlike what other people here have wrote here, I feel that what you should do on your turn is not all that obvious. The playing time is just right too (about 30 minutes).

Great Wall of China is a game where you are trying to compete for wall tiles by playing cards beneath those wall tiles.  

You have a deck of cards with values ranging from 1 to 3, some of which have special powers.  Every turn you check if you've got majority in a wall, and if so take a tile.  Then you play cards to a wall segment.

The game suffers from a flaw at the end of the game.  If wall segments clear on the last round, players may end up getting high value replacement tiles that they can snap up without competition.  I think this is one of the few games I'd want to house-rule due to this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Good game, with high level of interaction and room for smart plays. Since everyone has the same deck, knowing what has been played can be key, but while a sharp memory can be useful, isn't the key to winning. The key is to know to pick your battles - when to put pressure, when to back down and wait.

Great Wall of China has a nice amount of replay value, even with everyone having the same deck, as the draw can, and will, change from game to game, and also the value of the prestige tiles will be different.

Plays better with 4 or 5, and, putting aside some AP, it plays quickly even with these numbers of players.

Another solid design by Knizia.

my edition is a re-themed version of a Chinese Wall. instead of building a wall you fight for influence in queues to different shops during the communistic era in Poland. it's a nice theme, but i would only play the game with somebody who remembers the times (not that i do, i'd play it only with parents or some non-gamers from that generation)

Just when I thought I have had enough of Knizia, this game is a little gem. I am a fan of Samurai and this game reminded me of Samurai quite a bit. The hand of cards that you draw from similar decks for everyone is reminiscent of samurai. So is the fight for tokens or pieces on the board. 

I enjoyed the special powers for the cards as well and the cavalry really makes a huge difference in tight races.

About the only thing I am not too happy about is the ending for the game. It is a little uneven.

On further plays, I really dislike the end game scenarios. It is EXTREMELY uneven. I feel as if the new tokens coming up would cause a lot of grief. The end game scenario needs to be fixed in this otherwise decent game

Much better than I expected.  It works well, even if it is ALL MECHANIC, like Loco or No Thanks!.  It reminds me more of a Korsar variant than a Samurai card game (as some people call it).  For a lightweight filler, the people that I'm playing with sure are taking a lot of time processing their next move.  Most of the time, for me, the actions in this game seem pretty obvious--either this or this, or maybe this.

Played with 3, won handily because the other two players got into a ****ing contest.  Didn't like the game as much as Korsar/Loot, perhaps because the fixed number of walls seemed more constraining than sailing a variable number of merchant ships, or perhaps just because 3 is not the ideal number of players for the game.  So, a provisional 6 rating.

Reiner Knizia can develop amazing games.  Reiner Knizia can also develop annoying math-y drivel.  This title is definitely drivel.  If you took [gameid=3], made every figure the same, took out the interesting scoring and the vicious timing, and allowed people to play as many tiles as they wanted on a city, you'd have a good idea what this is like.   I like Samurai, but this game is uninspiring crap.  Leave it on the shelf in favor of his other, better titles.

Я не знаю, что все так недолюбливают эту игру. Только за то, что это очередной закамуфлированный абстракт от Райнера? Проще надо смотреть на вещи.
Довелось поиграть вдвоем, втроем и вчетвером. Больше всего понравилось втроем: игра осмысленней, чем вчетвером и не столь прямолинейна, как вдвоем. 
Самое главное - прочувствовать стратегию, а не тактику. А стратегия в этой игре (если не вдвоем) вытекает из правила вычитания силы секции стены для игрока, взявшего первый жетон, на величину этого жетона. Так вот, залог успеха - это подбор вторых (меньших) жетонов малыми силами, пока другие бодаются за крупный жетон на другом участке. Далее создается card advantage - длинная рука, которая позволятет во второй половине игры забрать пару-тройку старших жетонов и попутно м.б. еще какую мелочевку. Все. Игра сделана. Последнюю партию я выиграл этим способом с отрывом в 11 очков!

Knizia; Card Game; The Chinese Empire is threatened from the North, and so the Emperor orders the construction of a great protective wall. Each player has a set of cards in his color: seven wall cards (worth 1 point), three gate cards (worth 2 points) and one watchtower card (worth 3 points). Additionally, each player gets nine more cards of varying point value and which may also allow special actions to be carried out.

Great Wall of Chicken, is more like it.  How long are you willing to fight for a given set of chips, and how many cards are you willing to commit to them?  That you only evaluate the progress at the beginning of your turn makes for an interesting twist, but I think we were playing our first game incorrectly.

As you may expect there is some counting necessary. Use your deck to control the walls and gain the points. The 'do should I come first or not' and then 'should I take the 8 or the 3' gives a good little twist to the 'bidding'. A clever filler which is more than a filler really.

Chinese themed card game where each player with identical decks play sets of cards as a bid to win tile points. Characters on the cards may have changing effects on the bid values using the monk, dragon, or warriors. Interesting twist where locking a tile counts against your bid total. Hand management and card counting as rounds are completed with remainder of decks. Reminds me of Loot.

At first blush, feels like a combination of Samurai (individual player decks, a few pieces with special abilities, played to locations for effect) and Condottierre (vying for control of VPs instead of regions). Some interesting concepts, but the brinksmanship can reach levels of absurdity. In our first game, only 5 wall sections scored, so only 10 of the scoring tiles were even in play as no one wanted to yield a section. Biggest disappointment, however, was the strong kingmaking endgame. When the last player took her last turn, her card play could not win the game for her, but since she had to play somewhere to perform her actions, she was forced to decide who would win -- tie a section of a wall and allow no scoring, letting Player A win, or win the lower VP chip on another section of wall and allow Player B to claim the higher value token and win. Very disappointing, as I can see this happening frequently (especially with fewer players).

For its short play time, this game packs plenty of torturous gambling against the other players' secret situations.

Can't get enough! Even though this game makes your heart ache, you still want to push through and know more of what will happen, and you will try your best to make your characters alive because you'll get attached to them! You'll also feel sorry of what you did and the past that affected other people. The PC game is great and this board game is really very well made that it captured the same things you'll experience with the original game! It will give you lots of emotions and each time will be a great experience!

Would probably play better as a Fighting Fantasy/Choose Your Own Adventure book than a board game. Ideal for those who feel the need to wallow in the emotions of loss/grief/hopelessness et al. Great components and miniatures.

This War of Mine pitches players into a desperate situation; a city under siege, food and other supplies running short, and an increasingly hostile population to deal with. Members of our little group of characters may end up in a pool of blood or run off in desperation. A vividly written story book and a plethora of cards deliver shocks and occasional horrors. If your little band survives a while, a really strong narrative will build.  I found playing TWoM as immersive an experience as I’ve had with cardboard and plastic.

I do have some reservations.  In future I’d play with a maximum of one other player.  There just isn’t enough for more to do.  The game’s method of scattering rules here and there in the story book is really unhelpful.  There are decisions aplenty for players to make, but, as befits this setting, bad luck may kill your characters no matter how well you play.  Many will find TWoM too distressing or too random.  Although I admire its design, it isn’t a game I would choose to play often.

The artwork conveys the desperate semi-ruined city really well.  Production quality is good.

Interesting game. 
It succeeds at transfering the video game in boardgame. Some interesting mechanics.
The con: highly luck dependant. A lot depends of the roll of a d10. Compared to Robinson Crusoe, you feel like you have really little control here.

I've only played solo so far, but this game has absolutely blown me away. It tells a good story and has a very important message, but without sacrificing gameplay. Though your available actions through each phase are simple in terms of rules, the decisions you have to make are always tough, and usually a case of picking the "least bad option" rather than a good one. Deep, challenging, and so enjoyable. Love it.

Initial Impression: This is an impressive game design. The artwork, in particular the board, effectively captures the grittiness of the videogame which it's based upon. This is an extremely truthful conversion from digital to cardboard format. The decisions are tough, time and resources are limited, and you are basically struggling to survive for one more day. The rulebook format can initially be a little confusing but if something doesn't feel clear, it's probably because you skimmed over it in your eagerness to experience the game. And in the end, that's really what this game is. An experience. I suspect, similar to Robinson Crusoe, this game would work very well as a solitaire game.

It's hard to say I "enjoy" playing this. I like the game, but joy is no part of the equation. It's brutal, emotionally taxing, grim, and does exactly what I think it's supposed to do. I like how dark it feels, and the way it captures the worst humanity has to offer. This is a must play, but it is not a happy experience. Kind of odd that way.

I have high hopes for this game. Probably the most expensive Kickstarter game I've backed till date (and I didn't have any add-ons). I'm intrigue with the theme of playing as civilians trying to survive in the midst of war instead of being the typical war game of playing as soldiers. Another plus point is that it supposedly can learn while playing at the same time. 

UPDATE: Decided to sell it BNIS as I don't think it's my type of game. Most reviews actually even state that it's an excellent solo game or a good cooperative game for only up to 2 players.

A member of our group got this via Kickstarter and we played a 6-man game last night. Well, we attempted to play it; we bailed after 45 minutes or so as 3 of us really weren't digging it at all. From my score, it should be clear that I was one of these people. 

It's a game of minimal player action with far too much referencing of story texts and precious little to get me invested in the theme or general gameplay. For the most part it was as though the game was being dictated at me. Sure I could choose an option or two from a card every now and again, but I didn't really care. It's a single-player game spread over several players (unless playing solo) and it didn't work for me. I was thoroughly bored.

I am not a huge fan of playing solo. But after 3 solo campaigns in this war of mine, I must say this one f*cks u up. I especially love it when my life is just hanging on a small thread and fighting to survive just a couple of more rounds, its breath-taking. For me it doesn't matter if I win or lose its the experience that I'll remember.

Kickstarter edition

They tell you that can open the game and start playing right away and that's what I did. The first round was pretty slow because of all the little text parts that you had to read between the actions but the second one went pretty fast...until the game was over.

I lost my first game due to a few risky decisions that I tried rather than playing it safe. But still, I've read a lot of different cards and stories.

The game is really good. From a first impression. I have to play this several times before I can give a complete feedback but from the first playthrough it is really cool. Harsh and intense but still well designed and even better written.

The components are great. The realistic but still drawn artwork is really good. The plastic pieces are well made (the wood piece is too shiny for my taste). Only the cardstock might be a bit sensitive. But we'll se how it lasts after a few games.

The only negative is the layout of the rules...more specific: the idea of spreading rules and FAQ around the book of scripts is not very good. Yes this prevents the players from reading everything right at the start and helps their system of learning the rules and the game as you pay but I'd prefer a clearly structured rules reference at the end of the Journal over this layout.

Best solo game I've ever played and one of the most compelling games in term of narrative, intrigue and problem solving I've ever played.

The rules-referencing are a big mess. I see what they were going for with the journal; a way to slowly introduce the player to the basics but leave the rest out to be learnt via experience. So far it has only brought me levels upon levels of confusion and annoyance, especially with the "Advanced Rules" hidden in the Book of Scripts. Thank god I found a custom file with most of the hidden rules listed. 

There are two different responses to this deliberate design of Information Absence ; either it creates excitement, intrigue and mystery, or it creates annoyance, frustration and a sense of defeat. For me it was a mix of both but tilted towards the negative and annoying.

Small design gripe: the Colors deck should've just been a die.

don't let the "rule book" pulled you away.  BASED on ONE game (our 1st game :D)short version:
Pros: great game, components good quality, gameplay good challenge, fun and engaging. TONS of narrative. (note we are playing without "passing" the journal, is just 2 of us, so we just decide together about everything and play full co-op :D ). extremely high replay value. 
Cons: really hated the way they "hide" the rules all over the script book, but nothing that fans didn't fix with a compilation in one document of all this "faqs".  Also I wish that some of the scripts were less "rolling D10" and more "decide among options" and the fact that "so many" scripts are just narrative and "back to game" with no effect can be a bit meh. (maybe 1 game haven't give me a real impression)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.2
This somber game is a work of art and genius. Yet it's grueling, punishing, and not exactly "fun" in a traditional sense. It also suffers from the immersion breaking apart occasionally due to a huge amount of bookkeeping. 

Still, the experience is something else and this is a game most people should play at least once. I've found it actually affecting my outlook on life and it's birthed some genuine profound moments that make me want to be a better person. That's about the pinnacle of what this hobby can accomplish right there.

An experiment in ease of play...

Fine for a session or two, but the rulebook/reference guide simply doesn't allow for quick play after a while.

With a little bit more time spent refining the rulebook itself and possibly speeding up the game, this could have been good, as it is, it's adequate but unspectacular.

RATING: 10
This is the first time in a long while I've given a game a perfect score on any site, on any forum, or in any conversation.
The intricately weaved storytelling and complex ruleset is surprisingly easy to grasp, and the game manages to take the best parts of other games, and combine them with its own innovations.
It may not be ten-star-worthy for everyone, (which I understand fully) but this is a game that I will always enjoy picking up and playing, either with a group of friends (all of whom will need a hardened resolve to deal with this game's solemn to crushing tone) or by myself. For me, it just manages to hit the right notes.
The systems in the game are heavily influenced by dice rolls, but It's done very tastefully, and in a way that doesn't make you feel like you couldn't have stopped the outcome. There is definite rationing, skill, and planning required for this experience.

I love the video game. But I was so disappointed by he board game. The game structure makes no sense, it is so annoying to pass the book back and forth. I hate it. There is no scaling, unlike the video game. I was glad when the game characters killed themselves because the game finally ended. (Rated it a 5, as it might still be passable as a solo game. But even then, just play the video game. It is sooooo much better than this. Experience as a coop game is a 3).

I kickstarted Collector's Edition. I don't think I've ever received so much value for my money. A board game of the highest quality in components and in gameplay. I would say not just an ordinary game, this is no fun game for parties. This is highly themed, atmospheric and real game that drags you into it's world like no other. Experiencing the everyday struggle a group of survivors has during a war. Recreating this feeling through a board game is probably one of the hardest things ever achieved in board game history. I admire the team behind this game. And I cannot mention the involvement of Michal Oracz, a true board game genius, creator of one of my favorite games Neuroshima Hex. I can highly recommend This War of Mine, not just as a board game but also as an emotional experience. I love the new mechanics introduced in this game, I love the book of scripts and the decisions you have to make in your every move.

I have played several games by now. Love the thrill of uncertainty, continuous struggle to survive and internal conflict when stories of characters are being revealed. 
The game is really difficult. I'm quite good at planning ahead and not afraid to take the risk, but the game can be really stompy - wipe any plan and then snowball you to the miserable end. 
However this is very good educational aspect - to try to deal with misfortune and bad decisions which always hurt you in this game. 
This war of mine - the game which shows you what do you never want to witness in your life. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
First impression: Feels real. Hard decision after hard decision. Sometimes it dosen't matter what you do, just like in real life not everything is up to you. Life might just hit you straight in the face and you can do nothing.

Update: After a couple of tries and not getting past day 3 it's starting to fall apart for me. I wanted it to tell me a dark story but the game is to hard to enjoy the story. I dont really care what happens to the characters if i know they will die next day. I don't care what happens to the starved children i meet becuse i know that my characters will die in a day or two and i have to reset the game. It should have been more balanced in the start. Have not really gotten anywhere in this game.

The game is very dark, but intriguing. You have to do awful things to survive, but that is what war is for many people.
My main problems with the game are three:
1) The game is mostly decided by lucky or unlucky dice rolls with too many random events.
2) The game seems to be to hard to beat (played it three times in a row, lost three times). I'll give it another shot.
3) I might run out of motivation to play it, because it is very depressing on its own. Only thing that keeps me motivated is the drive to beat the game just once. Once it is done I am quite sure I will not play it again very often.

A grim game that accomplishes what it sets out to do-- portray the horrors of war. Unfortunately, I think it accomplishes this at the cost of being a good game. Too much relies on luck that can't be mitigated. Drawing a series of awful cards and events is thematic, yes, but it doesn't make for a good game.

One partial play that was worth it for the uniqueness of the experience. Not sure it's a game I would want to play more than, say, twice, but it's certainly something to experience. 

I'm not sure how much of a game this is vs being a simulation of the horrors of war. That's neither good nor bad but a matter of taste. In our play, we had some terrible things happen and we made choices as how to react to them (we chose to be kind), but the result was nonetheless terrible with a note to "Now resume the game" with no change in game state. 

Huh? No change to the game? So our decision didn't matter from a game perspective, it was just story? I appreciate the subject matter and I do think it's worth experiencing as I said, but it's an authentically dismal experience that doesn't leave me excited to come back and try to have my people do better. Maybe if there were more game here I'd find it more compelling for repeat plays.

RATING: 3
To paraphrase the Hemingway quote the authors of the game seem to be fond of, this is a game in which you'll die like a dog for no reason at all. There's a ton of randomness and it's totally unfair. You will lose games (perhaps even longer campaigns) because you didn't find what you needed while scavenging and you have no option to trade. You will lose because one of your guys will meet armed soldiers that attack automatically and get killed by them, plunging everyone else into depression. You will lose because the only guy you had who did not suicide, run away or die of starvation will get killed by a sniper while looking for help.

I loved the video game. I had high hopes for this boardgame. But TWoM:TBG is nearly unplayable. Your choices almost never matter, with the exception of the uninformed ones that will probably kill your characters. I'm just tired of resetting everything because a random even over which I had no control made me lose. Sorry, but in my opinion this is far from being a good game.

I really enjoy suffering through the mind-bending experience that this game brings to the table. It takes a little bit for everyone to understand how the 'turns' work, but after a little while, it flows rather beautifully. Best with 3-4 players that know each other well.

I can't quite figure out how I feel about this game. It is definitely innovative and its unique theme makes it an unusual experience. But after multiple plays it starts to feel a little "samey." I think it just needs a small expansion to boost the number of characters and cards and it could be much more replayable. All that said--the first few plays are quite amazing.

This is just a little bit too gritty and in your face for me. I can see the potential but I am not sure I am 100% ok with the subject material.

It's a bit strange that you do not each control a character, especially when you play 3 characters and 4 players and each turn is very long. Indeed we only played a single turn before I was too uncomfortable with one of the particular events that occurred. 

I would like to play again, but this time I will be going in with me eyes open to some of the truly dark materials within that may come up.

Una especie de Robinson Crusoe oscurísimo con las encrucijadas de Dead of Winter. Es inmersivo, narrativo, duro y largo, siendo estos adjetivos positivos. Para mi es un solitario. El juego no da tregua, todo el rato estás sufriendo para superar el día, para conseguir comer, para sobrevivir... La ambientación es muy buena y realista, las encrucijadas fuerzan a tomar decisiones muy duras... Juegazo, aunque no para cualquier momento

An incredibly thematic game which does not hold back on the punches.  It's very difficult to survive, but that's appropriate for the theme. I really love the book of events which sometimes has engrossing stories and sometimes even adds new gameplay elements and components.

The game plays long, but the option to save mid-game is included and the game is interesting throughout all of the playing time.

The rules are clear and after a few rounds I had the flow of the game mastered and could concentrate fully on the decisions and the story. Great stuff.

Really good "game" about the living in a besieged town. It is more simulation than game and everytime you play it is different.  The game ist depressing and you are managing the lack of stuff. It is very hard to not lose a character. But you can get new characters throughout the game. The boardgame covers the videogame nearly perfect.

This game ist not for everyone! The target audience is small. You like it or you hate it. Nothing between.

Players 1-6 is a joke. Don't play it with more than 2 players. It is basically a solo game. It works fine with two players. Especially that you can talk about the experience. If you want to play alone you better go with the pc game or app on your mobile device.

Gameplay is really immersive and superb. I always play with the "memories in the past" and "heart of the city" expansions because both expansions didn't add too much complicated rule while they add more variety of narration on both inside each character's mind and their community's point of view.

Rightfully called "The Schindler's List" among the board games, this is by no means a 'light' game: Not in theme, not in game play. But what a wonderful coop it is, one of the very best I ever played. Very thematic, immensely rich without being too fiddly, as hard as a coop should be.

It is not surprising that this game has provoked the most impressive board game review I ever read. If you want to know what this game really is all about, read this: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1816826/war-mine-review-survivor-siege-sarajevo

Played and then traded away.  As a solo experiment, it works.  It's very hard, it's tense, but it's also exhausting, and that's not just because of the theme.  The game is a bit of a slog and there's a lot of maintenance of tokens and health and supplies, etc. 

I enjoyed having it, and I hope whoever took it off my hands feels the same way.

Kickstarted. Awaken Realms did an amazing job with the production of this game. The components are great. Great solo experience, and I think two players is probably the maximum for this game. It really depends on the group. There are tough decisions and the odds are certainly against you. The game is very engaging and is a bit of a puzzle, with the understanding that at any time things can (very likely) go terribly wrong. The theme is dark, but it's worth thinking about in this day and age.

A brilliantly thematic game that is taxing, thought provoking and very atmospheric.

A great solo or couples game and especially good for educators to use as a tool to promote discussion.

First off, this game is not for everyone.  There is a level of complexity and intensity that is going to turn some players off.  That being said, I still have to give this game a 10!

Additionally, this game make a unique statement about realistic decision and realistic perils that no other game dares to do!

Rahdo sums it up pretty well. It is an excellent game, and I am proud to say that not only did I buy the video game on Steam, but also donated to war child charity. I look forward to buy this one too... they unfortunately made the mistake to put miniatures in their game which cost a lot of money to make the mold (2000$-5000$ per mini). I would be content with beautiful drawings of each characters on a 4 cm x 4 cm tile (or maybe bigger).

I look forward to see this game finished, it has great potential.

Can't wait to see a french version, much clearer and colourful than english.

Oh! And my vote for 16 years old and up is simply due to the harsh situations that the characters go through and encounters. They are really tough stuff to read and take for certain people... but that's what I like about the game, it shows us the horrors of war.

RATING: 7
This is a long game... We spent 4 hours ending up dead half way to the end.

I really like the mechanisms and the theme. Although I felt that I wanted more of the actual choices in the story. A lot was spent on exploring locations with no real options.

It feels really hard, you can die in so many ways.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
What an excellent game for 1 player. Despite being for 1-6 players, I find it hard to imagine a group of people sitting there and enjoying their time together being depressed about the horrors of war.

That is why this is such a great game for playing solo - it makes you think about serious stuff, and have really crucial moments for your characters in your decision making. This is a resource management game where the objective is to survive - and bad stuff happens all the time in this game, so your characters will always be on edge.

The rules are not the strong point of this game. The designers thought it would be a good idea to chop down the rules in several sections of the script (it's NOT), and failed to mention how several things in the game work (ie can I skip the Scavenging phase? What are the yellow numbers in tokens, are they the number of items - only to find out on my own that it could only be the price - or what does the "/" mean? Is it "or" or "and"?) All in all, the rules assume you will know stuff and that is a HORRIBLE experience. It made me frustrated every time I found myself confused on what to do not because of the decisions I had to take, but because I didn't know the rules.

But once I learned how to play the hard way, the experience was great - I had a lot of fun playing solo.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I think I'd feel a lot more positively towards this game if I didn't have Kingdom Death: Monster. A lot of stuff can and does happen, but it's all rather samey and grindingly attritional. This does not communicate to me the horrors of war, but rather the banality of bookkeeping.
There are some clever bits, and the game does have a fair amount of personality--but once you get some home improvement done, you're mostly just heading out for some wood and water and and weathering the events as best you can.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Not really a game. It's more of an experience. You have no control over anything. Roll the dice, draw a card, read the text. Add a heavy dose of fiddly book keeping..

I've read tons of comments about how this breaks boundaries by educating people of the horrors of war. Sorry, but I don't see it. There are tons of excellent books and documentaries about that. This aspect gets lost in TWOM since all the text you read is about horrible events and the writers have failed to make anyone care for the characters. There is no character building or anything to make us empathise. So choosing from "a girl is raped - will you save her or not?" is ultimately very easy because there is zero emotional attachment to these characters who live in what resembles a snuff film. And in the end such decisions won't even matter because at any time you can roll bad or pull a card that essentially says "game over".

I haven't played this yet, but if the board game have managed to capture even some part of what made the video game so good, then this is brilliant.

This is such an easy way to entertain the Players with just as much rules as really needed at a given Time! And the Story System guarantees for high replayability cause you only got a predefined amount of days where only a bunch of storytwists can and will happen. Those Story moments are randomly packed via search Cards and corresponding color coded Cards that grant for completely unique game sessions everytime you start anew! Awesome done! Really like it a Lot.

And best of all due to the fact that rules arent as omnipresent as in other Games this one can be played easily with non-boardgamers as well!

If you have any interest in Story telling games with social and moral aspects alike pick this one up it wont disappoint you! Furthermore here it really doesnt matter if you "win" the Game for the enfolding Story is what makes this Game a "win" and all those moral decisions that come along with those stories.

Awesome game!

Cheers and have a blast
A very pleased and passionate

Initial experience playing only solo is an 8. Really need to get some more play in with this one. I like how easy it is to jump in and play it. Have the KS stuff, but haven't used it.

TWoM is one of my favorite PC games due to the theme and survival elements. The board game does an excellent job of representing the same theme in its own, different, way. 

My initial impressions are that the Kickstarter additions are not at all necessary, and certainly aren't worth the inflated aftermarket prices.

Really, really solid coop experience. It's a grind for sure, and it's a little more plodding than I had hoped, but the systems all work really well and it is an excellent translation of the digital experience (which I was a huge fan of). Rating based on one play, and I could see it either going up or down based on if pace improves. (The amount of upkeep somewhat bogs down the turns). The journal style, learn as you play instructions worked great for a first play, but a reference sheet for later rounds/games would have been nice.

Some folks are ranking this poorly just cause they are annoyed They have not gotten their KS pledge yet. I hope they change their score once you actually play it because this game is amazing. Easily top 5 game for me. What it does it does so well, so thematically, and with so much narrative it's insane. As far as the 'rulebook' deal goes, the journal concept works brilliantly with this game. You learn 90% of the game in 5 pages of lovely designed and well thought out rules. Even the 'bonus rules' you look up in the script book really are simple and easy and intuitive. It also adds to the theme. This is purposeful. The characters don't know what they are doing when they start out. They have to learn as they go, you get used to the concept of scripts and you discover new ideas, options, and strategies as you go just like the characters in the game do. This experience would be diluted with a traditional 'rulebook.' If you want a 'cheat sheet' the BGG files page has several. This game is an experience, not a simple euro where you shuffle components around. Just forget everything you think you know about board games and just let this one play. It can be so rewarding.

This is the only game I have ever played where I really cared what happen to the characters. I mean, I know we all kinda care but in the end we think "ah, it's just a wooden meeple". In this game however, I felt emotionally invested which brought the engagement level up very high. I've not felt that way playing a game before and it was great. Plus I think the component quality and stories were well done.

Me: This Kickstarter game just arrived! It's supposed to be a gut-wrenching simulation experience of surviving as an ordinary civilian in a war-torn city  providing not only revolutionary storytelling, but some awesome gameplay to boot!
GF: Wow, let's try it!
.....30 minutes later.....
Me: OK, I think we've got everything set up correctly. Let's break open that Journal.
GF: What about the rules?
Me: Apparently, this teaches you as you go, so no need to learn anything beforehand!
GF: Cool!
.....First random event draw of the first round.....
GF: Did one of our three survivors just die?
Me:  ..Yep, I think so...well, I guess that's thematic?
GF: Sure, yea...
.....Meat of the first round.....
Me: So if we move that guy there, we can remove the rubble and access the rooms behind it. What do you think?
GF: Does that count as one action or all three?
Me: Oh, good point. Let me check.
.....10 minutes later.....
Me: Hmm well, it doesn't actually say...one of our people already died so why don't we just say it only counts as one?
GF: Fine.
.....Clean-up of first round.....
Me: ..And give water to each survivor so they stay hydrated.
GF: We don't have any water.
Me: Wait. Isn't that survivor already at max "thirstiness?"
GF: Yes...
Me: Was there any way we could have gotten water that round?
GF: No. What happens if we can't give her water?
Me: I'm sure it says in here somewhere... ... ...she dies.
GF: She dies?
Me: Yep, she dies.
GF: And our last survivor is now at max "thirstiness?"
Me: Looks that way..Should we play the second round?
GF: I think we got the point.

And that's the story of how This War Of Mine: The Board Game was unceremoniously put up for sale on eBay.

The game is fun as an atmospheric game like ToAN, but unlike that one you really have to exploit the game mechanics in order to stand a chance which detracts from the experience. Still better than Robinson though as it is less lucky.

Lots of holes in the rules. Neat idea, but not well executed.  Components are fine but nothing special.  Story is a bit underwhelming compared to what the theme could offer.  Story writing is similar to Twilight Fan Fiction (hey they got 50 shades of grey so that isn't entirely a cut down but it is not my cup of tea). The play is a bit redundant and there are very swingy moments where everything is fine and then the next turn almost everyone is dead based on a card.  Not terrible but not something I need to keep or want to play more than once a year or two.

KS. Met the guys at Essen 2016 for a long session.
As a board game it is an astonishing achievement. To tackle a subject like this and make it accessible is no easy feat and playing it is not a 'comfortable' experience - it's not supposed to be!
The rules let it down somewhat (which is why i have only given it a 9.0!) but there is lots of advice and some very good pdfs on BGG to sort (most of) the ambiguities but it can be a bit of a slog sometimes to find the best interpretation.
The stretch goal packages and add-ons are just amazing and give so many extra options that the longevity of the game as a whole is remarkable due to the sheer variety.
The game is difficult to master but persistence does pay dividends because forward planning becomes a bit easier the more you play. However, quite literally, damage limitation from the random events and bad dice rolls can scupper the best of plans and then the game leaves you with some very, very, difficult choices which will nearly always be different from game to game.
An amazing game and a much more immersive experience than the computer game which was also very good.
But its undeniably a tough thematic experience which many will shy away from.

RATING: 10
Played solo, I won't comment on my thoughts about larger groups as it's obviously not fair. I could see this game having a massive emotional impact on players. It's the most immersive game I have by far, detail is incredible, and I think it achieves its goal of creating emotional reflection.

It's very hard, and very deterministic, maybe too much so for some board game folk. But it's an experience worth at least trying. From a perspective of personal reflection, this is the best of what board games can achieve and i would imagine would be great played with friends who are up for it.

First impressions after a play of a single night.

The novelty of the rulebook (you encounter rules as you play the game) is interesting, and would work much better if there were a proper, separate rule book. But I still don't think that it's a good way to present the rules, because many (all, so far) of them are much more detailed than you need just at that moment in the game. So the game stalls while you plough your way through several paragraphs on text that will be important at some point in the future. So better remember where you read it, pal. Ugh.

You make many choices without realising their significance - or knowing that they're significant but with no way to guess what impact they will have on your game. You can say that's simulating the uncertainty of the people in that situation, but that's nonsense, because the next time you play, you will take the same decision in full knowledge of the implications. So does that mean that the game can only be played once? Naa. And some of the decisions are game-ending, so it's that serious.

Don't get me wrong - I think that the sense of uncertainty and tension is excellent, but it's really hard to believe that I won't play very differently in the next game. Not because I have a better strategy, but simply because I know the mechanics of the game better. "You must do X now, because there's a very high probability of Y happening and you are going to need Z to survive." Reminds me of those old text-based dungeon crawlers from back when computers weighed as much as a small car.

There's an uncomfortable amount of ambiguity in the text of the cards. We spent quite a while parsing and reparsing to try to understand what was intended. I know that players are supposed to make their own decisions about the meaning of the rules, but in some cases it just feels annoying and sloppy. Why have a card that causes the game to stall for 5 minutes while you try to work out what is intended? This is not a mechanism to increase player involvement, but lazy proofing.

So. Having survived the first day with all the characters alive and hungry, what do I think?

1. Both my companion and I agree that this is really a solo game. The advantage of playing with more than one is not obvious. 
2. I'd be very surprised (and happy) if my companion plays the second day.
3. I'm very interested in the game, and will definitely try to get through to the final objective - or at least the first.

When I play new games I usually go to BGG for rule updates. One of the files on BGG contains all of the rules including the "hidden advanced rules". I haven't read any of them, but their existence gives rise to a question: why? Is this mechanic intended to turn the game into a kind of legacy game? 

It should be made clear on the box that the rules will change as you play, not half-way through the development of the game.

The designers intend players to find hidden rules as the game goes on. It means that it's designed as a solo or legacy game.  If it were designed as a co-op you'd expect to play it with different groups, including people who've not played it before. This is only a coop if an experienced player who plays with new players either "forgets” the advanced rules that they know (some of which might be life-savers!) or tells the new players about advanced rules that they haven't yet encountered. That's an obvious consequence of having hidden advanced rules, not something that can only emerge during play testing.

Tells a grim story with solid mechanics. It is only a bit questionable if this is a game at all (well, yes it is resource management game with HUGE RNG-factor). Also doesn't suit too well for multiplayer gaming unless all are prepared for sharing an experience instead of game.

In the pantheon of hard co-ops, this one lives up to expectations. My only critique is that there is still too much dice rolling, and since dice hate me, I may never win this particular game...
Still, it is phenomenal. A rich simulation of living as a civilian in the midst of war. The replayability is vast, and the decision space equally ginormous.

Cywile chowają się w budynkach zniszczonego przez wojnę miasta. Na zewnątrz wojna a w środku walka o przetrwanie i trudne wybory moralne. Na radość płynącą z gry bym się nie nastawiał. Gry w wersji angielskiej trafiają już do wspierających, polska będzie w ciągu 2-3miesięcy ale równie dobrze może być to grudzień 2017 Produkcją zarządza Galakta ale druk międzynarodowy więc wszystko zależy od najwolniej tłumaczącego, a jest co tłumaczyć.

RATING: 4
As a huge fan of the video game and with a theme that was right up my alley, this was  quite a disappointment. I didn't feel the same heavy emotions like the video game probably because you're dealing with confluted rules, cumbersome cards, messy maintenance it makes it hard to feel for any of these characters. Constantly chucking random dice rolls, dealing with the same unevental events, objectives. Yes the scripts are the best part. But this tries so hard to be a game and well you're truly surviving off of luck and little strategy. I'm a much bigger board game fan than a video gamer and well I would much rather play the Pc game over this anyday. Want a solid survival co-op game play Robinson Crusoe instead.

Initial Impressions: I thought I was mentally prepared for this game. After all, I generally like pretty dark genres of tv shows, and I like hard co-op games. However, This War of Mine being so dark in a very realistic, non macro setting really removes the abstraction that this is game, preventingmy normal "this is a safe space to experience such dark topics because it isn't actually happening to me" to manifest.

This depressing nature is enhanced by 2 factors: that as your people become worse off they slowly lose actions, and the high level of randomness in the game. While say Robinson Crusoe makes you feel helpless if you don't get a good start, the certainty of the benefits of most actions still gives you a sense of control (whereas in say Ghost Stories there is a fair bit of randomness, but at death's door your team still works about as well as when at full health).. Here, it feels like you are slowly dying, and you aren't sure what you can do about it.

That's not to say the randomness is necessarily bad. While the range of how good or bad some actions are can range widely, what exacrly happens to you fits really well with what you would logically expect to happen, e.g. if you send people out scavenging you might find a cache of resources, or have your characters run into a gang and get beaten up. In short, the game puts thematic immersion above all else.

I'm a little bit leery of how many of the exploration cards you go through each game. That, combined with if the story paragraphs and chapter objectives start to feel samey will probably determine long term replyability for me.

Not a fan of the learn the rules as you play rulebook, although it shouldn't be too difficult to just read it in its entirety before your first play.

Overall, I definitely like this game and it gives a thematic experience unlike any other . However, I probably will only be able to pull it occasionally considering the gravity of the topics it covers, and note that while I think there is strategy and that this isn't just a total dicefest, the certainty of any single action is quite low. It appears more to be expect failure, just mitigate the losses.

Mechanically interesting and great storytelling game about trying to survive a real war. Like in the real world, life (and the game) can be unfair at times. I can understand how this could rub gamers the wrong way and obviously the theme is very dark, providing very little hope. However, I find it fascinating to explore. I would add another ".5" if it weren't so brutal as a game. I have yet to reach chapter 3.

Kickstarter Feb 2017.  Good but dark theme.  Although at first I thought the game was just depressing and contemplated selling it, I'm now convinced it's brilliant, and can really be fun when you do well.  Still haven't tried the sewers and tactics expansions, or the children, or the desperate measures, or the advanced board, or the farmers, or the dog/cat, or "our street".

Perfect mechanics and incredibly thematic gameplay. The length of the campaign mode (the only type I've played so far) is not too short. It takes about 4-5 hours to complete and I'm very happy about that. Like I said, really thematic. It would lose that all if it could fit into an hour or so.

[b]10: Outstanding game. One of my all-time personal favorites.[/b] 
At its core, it's a worker placement game. However this is what First Martians [i]should[/i] have felt like if FM was not a sterile, what's going to break this turn, convoluted mess. Playing this I had flashbacks to our visit of Dubrovnik, Croatia on our honeymoon, where we visited an independence museum, where there's the incredibly moving picture of a 3 - 4 year child hauling water for their family in the city while it was besieged by Montenegrin forces. 

It's dark, gritty, it sucks you in, the learning of the game as you go is right out of the video game and actually works. If you aren't told to do something, don't do it, probably the single most important "rule" in the journal. You can see the world and characters start to deteriorate, the events play out in your head as you go along, this game, for me has the "it" factor. 

War sucks, sometimes you can't control everything, but the story that is told here is amazing. Simply put, I really love this game.

This is a hard review for me to leave, and it's pretty lukewarm?  I might edit later?

I love this video game.  I especially love playing with the child characters, as heartrending as that makes it, because of the added realism.  I'm an historian, and I specifically study children's experiences in early America.  Children in war time is a horrible but important topic.  

I've played literally at least 80 hours of the video game.  I play it by myself.  I lose myself for hours.  And it destroys me, but it's just me.  I'm able to just burrow on in.  So, I think that's the first reason I don't really enjoy the board game.  Even when it's only my partner and I playing a two-player game, the dynamic is different.  

Additionally, I think that the rules of the board game changed a lot of what made the video game so accessible.  It's a hard topic, so the rules need to be extra clear and simple so that the focus is on surviving the war.  That's why the point and click works so well for the video game.  Also, the board game made things like water and food much less accessible than the video game.  And yes, things should be hard to access.  It's a Civil War.  But I thought the rarity in the video game was much more valid, and allowed for harder decisions when you found food while scavenging.  The board game makes it harder to find food in general.  In your house, scavenging, and when rolling to find an extra scavenging good.  I'm really not impressed.  It's not engrossing for me, it's off-putting.  Not because of the topic, not because it's a war.  Because of the mechanics.

A great solo game with elements of worker placement, exploration, and character management. However, the Book of Script elevates this game from being merely great to truly mesmerizing. Nothing else plays like this in the boardgame world, it feels like playing a narrative video game (this game has even more variation than most narrative video games!).

Sure it's brutally hard and, often, very unfair, but that's war time for you. This game is an experience you should not miss.

Be warned though; this is not an easy game. What I mean by that, is that it is easy to learn. But it is quite hard to actually survive until the end. The mechanics are very good; game plays smoothly. And the stories are very well written. Some choices gave me shivers and some are burned into my memory. All in all an very unique, very good game. But probably not for every one.

I have not beaten this game once, but the narrative is so good.  I once lost in two turns due to a bad draw of weak characters and an event draw of double night raids using the advanced rules where I was attacked four times.  I'm afraid to ask my friends to play this.  I love the individual deaths, but this game can be extremely ... depressing.  Throw in some Portis Head and Cure, and you'll join the protagonists in certain death.  Yet, I really love this game.  As a military retiree, this hits a lot of check marks for me in realism.  This doesn't always feel like a game.  The variety of interactions is so realistic that I feel this should be an instruction tool for Americans with no clue what many countries and refugees go through.  The next time some raiders take my hard earned guitar, I'm gonna go on rampage.  The setup time is pretty good compared to several games with this many chits too.

What a brilliantly slick production! We got absolutely pulverised by this on or first play, but it was still a great ride to our horrid deaths via starvation.

My only criticism is that it's really a single player experience. The "pass the book" mechanism doesn't really work. Still, if you have a team who aren't going to be railroaded by one strong personality, discussing the possibilities as a group before mutually agreeing on all decisions is a good option.

This game is dark and rather complex, but with an easy to follow guide you can get playing rather easilly, and then add layers of complexity one by one. At first it seems a little overwhelming, with ALOT of different cards and ressources, but when you get started it turns out not to be that bad.
It surprised us how invested you get in the fates of your survivors :)

Great adaptation of the video game. Pretty much everything is here with some slight tweaks. The daytime worker placement-like phase is neat, and the book of encounters here is really well done. The only part that really bugs be is the fact that this is so close to the video game that I don't know why I would ever not just play that. Plus this game is essentially solitare anyway. Still, the designers sound be commended for a worthy adaptation. I only wish it wasn't so meticulous with performing actions and manipulating components.

Traded.

Not a fun game, every moment is drenched in soul crushing sadness and relentless gloom. We played it three times and found it absolutely impossible to do anything other then slowly die, sometimes without any chance to do anything else, the card said a player was dead and that was that. It gives an insight into what people in war-torn countries have lived and died through but was far to depressing to be any fun at all. I'm exceedingly happy to be rid of it.

So this game is a little hard to describe. The game play is pretty easy but with hard meaningful choices. You and you friends take turns making choices for a community. You do not play as an individual character. While he game is fun if you like sort of experience . The game is very sombering , its not a joyful or funny game. You have to make pretty messed up choices .

Too much randomness and way too fiddly. It feels like it was designed by video game designers who were loathe to give up any control of the AI. So many decks of cards. It felt clunky and not very elegant. So much dice rolling. I'd try it again to see some variety come out of it and explore the narrative a bit. But I just didn't find it to be very fun or interesting.

Pre-order cancelled. Too many alarm bells being set off - idealistic, sentimental twaddle, more about "moral" judgements than survival. What people say they'd do in a war zone whilst surrounded by comfort and security vs what they'd really do when it has come down to a simple you or them (or even just being given the freedom to act in an arena where law and judgement have lapsed wholly) - well, hopefully none of us will ever have to put that to the test, but it's never pretty...

This is a solo game, I have no idea why they wrote the numbers 2-6 on the box when we do not even get our own survivors. We just randomly pass the active player.

The game is missing a turn order overview, it's a bit annoying to turn the rulebook pages again and again to make sure you don't miss a step (at least during first plays).

...and it's sometimes very fiddly: you draw a card that says "read a number somewhere else, then open the storybook at 660". Then you have to check again where you are, then read on page 220 in the storybook, then you may take a loot card from another pile and proceed with"... 
Stuff like this happens quite often.

Other than that, pretty brutal and punishing game, both in terms of story and gameplay.

I'm not quite sure what to think of This War of Mine: The Board Game. It does capture the same feeling as the video game. War sucks. Big time. And double that if you're a civilian caught in it. And in this game, you are. You are stuck in the ruins of shelled building with a handful of survivors, just trying to make it till tomorrow. Day by day.

And this is where it gets a bit weird. Or special, depending how you want to look at it. The game has got this choose your own adventure feel in it and you manage a base and a group of survivors on the side. There's a thick story booklet, stacks upon stacks of cards with locations and different kinds of events and challenges, and a promise of a mindbending amount of bittersweet stories that may unfold. So it has got that going for it. However, the game is very random. I don't think that's a problem normally if the game plays fast and engages the player in one way or another. TWoM: The Board Game does that, it plays fast (at least if played solo) and it engages the player, but I think there might be a problem with how that combines with the managing aspect of the game. Careful choices can be made but no matter how you manage the situation, the game can swiftly end in figurative (or literal) rocks fall and then you die situation. And that can feel a bit aggravating. And it did for me, after hours of gaming.

But that's war for you, it isn't fair and it is chaotic, and in that sense This War of Mine is thematic and realistic through and through. But then again, thematic and realistic isn't always a good thing, and I've got very mixed feelings regarding how This War of Mine, either the video game or the board game plays. For the benefit of the video game, I've got to say that everything is automatical and instantaneous, while the board game isn't. And that's the main difference, making the video game the superior experience in my humble opinion. But let it be said, that the video game isn't quite my cup of tea either which makes me eye the board game very suspiciously.

Also, this is a solo game that masks itself as a multiplayer game. Having additional players literally means nothing else than having company to talk with while playing. So, dunno. I'll give it a 7. Not bad, not something I'm crazy about. And I sort of want to play more but simultaneously I hate it how close to life this game is. Things just happen, what the heck.

After being tantalised by months of BGG chatter about worries of KS delivery dates, retail release dates, etc, I got a call from my FLGS advising that they had a copy for me.  Hurrah, it's arrived!  Hurrah, it's worth the wait!

In the first week I played this through solitaire six times, finally winning on the fifth attempt.  I was a bit sceptical of the 'play straight from the box' claims and even a bit disappointed that there was no rule book to pore over (I love a good rule book).  However, once I'd got used to learning the rules as the game unfolded I found that it really worked; apart from having to refer to the few rules dotted throughout the Book of Scripts at intervals (why are they not all together?) I've genuinely been able to play the game as intended, following the journal to guide me through each day.

As advised in the game introduction and in several threads on the Geek, one of the keys to getting the most out of the play is to become immersed in the story rather that merely going through the mechanics.  Certainly in my solo playing I've followed this maxim and it's added value to the game and made some of the choices more difficult, particularly when the wording of the decisions to be made can make you feel rather heartless and lacking in compassion for people you meet in the text.  And don't think that there's no down side to stealing all you want from the needy and defenceless: often, these actions increase the misery rating of your characters (misery is difficult to reduce and, for the less hard-hearted characters, easy to acquire).  A misery rating of 4 is just as much an end to your character's life in the game as a 4 rating for wounds or illness.

For the time being the delays on this game have cause the current rating to happen. Issues with delivery and errors have resulted on failed promises that are always renewed with statements such as "in the next two weeks" , "in the next two days" or "in 2-3 days".

One entire game requires several hours, you may be able to "save" the game by listing down what's on the board or taking pictures.

What I love-hate about this game is the encounters through the book of scripts. At night, if you have characters going out to explore to try to find for stuff, you may and most probably will have encounters through the book of scripts. Some encounters require you to make decisions. 

Depending on how "deep" you are into the theme, the game attempts to test your morals against your need to survive.

The one I could remember clearly was that I saw a box which some kids were messing around with, there is something inside which is clearly useful to me but I've decided not to take it for myself and my group. 

That made me think, "If I was put in a situation like that in real life, would I have taken the box?". It might be possible but I wouldn't really know until it really happened. 

Because unlike in the game where it's just status tokens that you need to lower by getting resources, I would most probably be really feeling fatigued, hungry, ill, lost, alone etc in a real war.

If you are not that "deep" into the game, this is just a resource management, push your luck game, similar to some other co-operative games. Do they have enough to eat/drink? Do they have enough weapons to protect themselves? Do they have enough rest? etc. Do I want to continue searching the place when I'm already making so much noise? Do I want to risk strangers finding me searching/stealing "their" property/belongings?

This game was obviously a labor of love, and I can respect the work that went into it and the designer's ambition. And to some degree, I think this game has the potential to be the type of game that really pushes other designers in new and exciting ways. 

However, playing this game is a random mess, and no matter how well off you are, one bad draw can ruin you. And here's the kicker: almost all the draws are bad. Moreover, this game is as dark and gruesome as you've heard, but I never had a moment of empathy for my little plastic figures or the tails I read while I was visiting their world. In fact, I never reached a point where I felt like I was in a world. I always felt like I was pushing around bits of plastic and paper on cardboard. I was hoping to escape to a new experience, to a new type of board game, but perhaps my hopes were too high...and maybe that's not entirely the game's fault.  

The last straw came when my survivors disappeared because they didn't get enough coffee or cigarettes. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!? It's a friggin' war zone out there and I am losing survivors because of a lack of luxury items!

At it's best, I thought this was a nice, but extremely frustrating solitaire puzzle. At it's worst, I found myself staring at other games on my shelf, wishing I could push This War of Mine off the table for something more palatable.

I *love* paragraph games! But this doesn't use the book as often as the only other paragraph game I've played -- Tales of the Arabian Nights. This is unfortunate as the non-paragraph part of the game feels like a generic co-operative game.

It's the only co-op game where I don't care if we collectively lose. Considering the theme, it actually makes a lot of sense that we will more likely lose than win.

A great mystery, but I'm still on the fence with limited plays about whether it is a good game. The massive book of scripted narratives are enticing… making you wish to explore even when it is not the sound strategy. I have not won the game yet and defeats have been sudden and brutal. The dark, nihilistic theme may not be to my taste.

This is hands-down the most impressive board game I've seen to date. The theme is so perfectly embedded in every aspect of the game - from the intricate mechanics and behavior of the characters, to the last event card and equipment token. The really amazing part about this game is how you actually "grow" while playing the game - you start literally not knowing what's going on. You make choices that you do not know their exact consequences, and just have to trust your best judgement to tell you what to do. "Should I bring back more food, or should we trade it for some meds?" - the rules don't specify what every single token does, and you just have to make the decision that makes the most sense to you at that point. As the game evolves, you gradually learn how everything works, what is used for what, and how things are tied by cause and effect - you become a more experienced survivor in this world. This game is like no other in the experience you'll get - it's a deep, rich, evolving, even emotional ride. 

The game itself has its own pace. It's a journey of survival that you play over multiple sessions. Each "day" can take 40-60 minutes to play, and there are 10 days in a full game - we like to play around 2 days each session and that's plenty for us. It's a slow, but also very engaging game. Don't expect instant adrenaline rushes here - the game is a continuous chain of events, encounters, highs and lows. Playing one day takes time, and you'll have to make multiple difficult decisions on the way.

There are two issues with this game which prevent it from receiving a perfect 10 for us:

1. The game is not a very good multi-player game. It's really a solo game, where players just take turns making the next decision. We play it mostly 2 players, and so far, we could not find a really good way to divide the decision making among us (the approach suggested in the rulebook is way too much of a ping-pong for us, so we tried unifying steps in different ways - nothing really caught on). What we ended up doing is just discussing each decision, then taking the one that we agree upon. So far it's worked ok for us, but it's not an optimal system, and it definitely does not scale well to more players.

2. The "learn as you play" approach does not work at all. The idea is great, and is obviously inspired by computer games where you just follow a quick tutorial, then jump straight into the game. The designers clearly tried to recreate this experience in a board game - a brilliant, and extremely bold move on its own right - but unfortunately, the result is pretty poor. The short rulebook (aka "journal") is quite deceptive - "just read a few lines, then play the next phase" - that is not true. In fact, once you read those few lines (which are not enough to understand the rules), you are directed to continue reading an FAQ entry in the book - which can be twice as long as the journal. Only after reading both the journal and FAQ do you actually understand how to play the next phase and can continue with the game. This is tedious, slow, and makes the first few rounds quite boring - you are essentially reading a full-length rulebook WHILE you're trying to play the game. We did not enjoy it at all.. We finally concluded that one of us (me) should just read the entire journal and accompanying FAQs, then proceed to play the game. Things became much better after this. This game desperately needs a "real" rulebook that explains all the rules and is easy to navigate, particularly considering the number of phases, actions, procedures, and other moving parts the game has.

Summary: This War of Mine is a hallmark in board game design. It's a unique, very creative, and extremely ambitious project that has (mostly) been done to perfection. There is nothing like it out there. As far as pure gameplay goes, there are surely better games with better mechanics. Just for gameplay I would probably rate this as a 7.5. But this game does not compete with any other board game - it's a holistic experience of story, game play, tough decisions, and incomplete knowledge, all joined together to recreate - if just a small, small bit of - a war zone reality at your home. It's an amazing feat of board game design, and easily deserves 9/10 for what it is and what it does to board gaming overall. It's a masterpiece of a board game. Very well done.

After three play throughs, still no victory but came close in last turn on last game.  Really impressed by this game and how cool it is.  Seems like there's enough content to support many playthroughs, so haven't had too many duplicate events yet, and haven't had to dig into any expansion yet to add variety, though started using Heart of the City, which adds great story content and decisions.

My favorite solo game right now, and enjoyed the game with +1 person.

-AND- Many plays later this game is still different every time.  So much story here and very difficult to win, which I like.  Just when you think everything is fine, the story throws a wrench into your best plans and you're back to survival mode.

Wow, this is one hell of a game... while I would like to say it's fun to play, that would be wrong. This game is amazing, in a dark way... on my first play through we were instructed to look up the Srebrenica massacre and already knowing about what it was I was taken back to when I heard about it and what atrocities had happened then... even with such dark imagery, I still found the game to be one of the best I've played in quite a while. It made me remember... and made me more invested in keeping my survivors alive until the end...

選擇的未知性和生存的急迫性使遊戲節奏的緊湊

遊戲的隨機性和玩家預先做好準備的策略性有著很棒的平衡
這點在靠骰子的遊戲裡十分少見

僅適合2-3人遊玩，4人以上將使遊戲變得冗長 反而難以投入

Why a 10? Because that one is currently not on his right ranking place...a huge work!
Of course, it is very very hard...my heart beats faster than usual during all gameplay, maybe exept when you come back from scavenging with for exemple coffee, cigarettes (no fear when drawing the fate card)  a broken weapon that you can fix or a chem for the trap you have built because you really MUST eat now ....well that depends a lot of things..you will have to accept which mistakes you have done even if you were in this session for several hours, and as it is a game, you will be able to come back to life, stronger...
This one is so pleasant to play, the graphics helps, the replayability is enormous according to thousands of scripts to discover....a bit of luck will also help, as in real life.
I will buy every expension for sure. Moreover but it is personal, it helps me to improve my english....I don't want to wait for the frog version :). Heart stroke 2017. Enjoy it!

[2017-12-11]
A játékban civileket irányítunk, akik a háborút próbálják túlélni egy házban és környékén. A házat fel tudjuk fedezni, ahol dolgokat találhatunk a túléléshez, a környéken különböző változó helyszínekre mehetünk el portyázni főleg élelem és víz utánpótlásért, de mindig hagynunk kell örzőket, akik a menedékünket védik éjjel a betolakodóktól. A játékban kártyák adják a változatosságot, illetve a Kaland Játék Kockázat könyvhöz hasonló lapozgatás. Izgalmas, jól megoldott a portya rész, ahol mi döntünk mekkora kockázatot vállalunk a kutatás hosszúságával. Nagyon jól kitaláltak a különböző karakterek, akik közt van sokkal jobban és szinte alig használható is. Mivel egy szkenáriót próbáltam, így a többi változatosságáról nem tudok nyilatkozni, de csak így belenézegetve nagyon érdekesnek tűntek. A játéknak egyetlen nagy hibája van, ez 1 fős, maximum 2 fős játék, ahol az egyik játékos a lapozgatást végzi és a sztorikat olvassa. Nehéz több játékos esetén elosztani a feladatokat, mert a karaktereket nem lehet, hisz számuk folyamatosan változhat a játék során. Az első küldetésben a feladat, hogy a 10 kör után legyen egy túlélőnk megfelelő kondíciókkal. Sikerült most nyernünk, de előtte 4-szer nem nyertek a játék bemutatói, tehát nehéz játékról van szó, aminek hihetetlen sötét, borús a hangulata. Nem ismerem a számítógépes játékot, de azt el kell ismerni, hogy rendkívül kidolgozott játékról beszélhetünk, ami teljesen jól működik, de csak 1 vagy max 2 főre ajánlom. A pontszám bőven lehetne nagyobb, de én a többfős, nem ilyen típusú játékokat kedvelem, tehát a maga nemében ez 8-as, 9-es játék is lehetne.

Really good game! I do miss a rulebook tho. The game says the manual is the only thing you need and the game teaches you everything else but i find it very fuzzy with alot of rules.

Heavy theme that surely DO NOT fit alot of players.

Whether you win or lose feels completely coincidental. 

This "game" is entirely random and completely depressing. Every decision you make, every action you take is completely out of your control, decided either by a predetermined outcome, or a roll of the "Fate Die." 

There is no traditional rulebook, instead you learn rules as you play through the scenarios. It could have been an interesting idea (there are thematic reasons for this) but all it does is make looking up rules impossible, you will run into situations where you don't know how to do something because you haven't happened upon that particular rule yet.

"This War of Mine" is an interesting experiment in interactive art. Unfortunately it's not a good game.

This game seems fascinating.  Like Tom Vassel said in his review, this game is a work of art - similar to a movie like Schindler's List.  Most will see it and be moved, but will likely not see the movie again.  Some like this sort of thing and may see it again.  The idea of a rulebook that tells you only what you need to know in the moment is VERY intriguing to me.  I can see why some may be put off by it, simply because it is such a different approach from what is out there today.  I would really like to play this game cooperatively or in solo mode.

This War of Mine is a peculiar beast. It certainly strives for profundity, it's stretching its arms all the way up to the top shelf, yet it's such a brittle experience, equal parts compelling, broken, profound, infuriating, and overreaching. There's a lot to like, and some meditative moments to glean, but it's only successful in part.

I wouldn't recommend it for more than three players total, and even then I think it shines as a solitaire title.  But wow.  They really nailed it.  The Book of Scripts was either going to be wonderful or a disaster, and it's absolutely the former.  The theme and the mechanisms blend beautifully to create haunting, memorable, and unique tales of death and survival.  I'm really glad I took a chance on this one.

Went in with a late pledge since I missed that they confirmed full translation at the end of the campaign (I wasn't too enarmoured with the mixed language situation during the campaign). The theme is what gets me interested. And since it is a kinda-coop game (well, it is coop, but you play together, passing the decision "token" around, and not alongside each other), so has chances to get out in our game group.

Played once with 4 players, it seemed like a pretty interesting game, with some interesting new mechanics added on to the survival genre.  

However it definitely felt like a solo game with silly "turn order" rules built in to sell it as a multi player game.

You effectively get to play one phase of the turn, which you usually talk through with your table mates, so essentially you are all just co-oping the game, without controlling your own characters.  You all control everyone.

In short it seems like it would be a fun game to solo a few times, but not necessarily something that works great in a group setting.

RATING: 10
First of let me say that I am a game who quite frequently states that I do not like Co-op games. I just don't. They are fine for some people just not this people. Given the subject matter of this game however and the goals of the designers/publishers to create a narrative drive gaming experience I was intrigued by it.

I can honestly say that I feel this game has delivered on creating a dark, and oppressive experience.  This game takes what Above and Below thought it was trying to do and excels by leaps and bound beyond that. Nothing against A&B but I found the "stories" very generic and boring after about 3 plays.  

This does definitely mean that this game is NOT for everyone, and I won't want to play it all the time even myself.  But when in the mood for it, I can't imagine any other game even coming close to creating the atmosphere and tension that TWoM has so readily delivered. 

I would like to further add that I am a fan of games made for adults.  Most all of the movies I watch are R rated movies.  My favorite shows come from networks like HBO that have an adult nature and don't shy from harsh language and subject matter. I am an adult after all and enjoy films by Quinten Tarantino.  TWoM falls into this category nicely.  Not all games have to be "Family Friendly" and this game is definitely falling into the "R" rated zone and I approve.

RATING: 9
Kickstarted.

This is a tough game.  With that said, I still enjoy it.  The story telling is good, although can be bleak and dark.  Your characters can and will die which is why they are controlled by the group and not individually.  There are difficult decisions to be made.  Who gets to eat/drink...who sleeps and who stands guard...who goes out scavenging...decisions to be made during the stories.

There is definitely luck involved.  But it makes sense to me because it's a game about survival and luck can play an important role in that.

I like the push your luck style scavenging.  I like that I get to build equipment in my safe house and use that equipment to make/gather things that are essential to my group's survival.  I enjoy the stories although they can be depressing and sad.

I applaud the creators for making a game that depicts a more realistic tone of war than just the glory of battle.  This game is not for everyone but it can be fun and challenging and at least for me, causes me to think more about the effects of war and how it influences more than just the soldiers.

This game isn't as pick-up-and-play as advertised, which was a bit frustrating for us. But, by the third day, I think we had a 90% hang of it. (We still don't know how many wounds bandages can heal).  As a solo gamer, I would recommend playing this with more than one player.  Making group decisions and watching everyone's reactions to the scripts are awesome.  The game is not for everyone, but I really enjoy it. Setup isn't too bad. Gameplay is smoothe.  A lot of luck,  but that luck is based off your decisions and their consequences.  The expandability is also pretty cool and I'm hoping for more content in the future. Most importantly, I got the entire game + stretch goals and current expansions to [barely] fit in the box.

If I was rating this as a single player game it would easy get a score of 8, but at the advertised (1-6 Players) this game fails. playing with any other player count then 1 just feels like you are taking turns playing a single player game or giving advice to another person playing. This game is long but that is not something that I would normally fault a game for I love long games but when you are literally doing nothing other then maybe some advice for the person who's turn it is to play the game it is very boring. 

By this games rules you could make any solo game 6 player, you just have one person do the draw phase, then the next player play the cards, then the next player resolve actions etc. it just does not work. If you are looking for an awesome solo game this is it but don't bother if you want to play with friends.

An ambitious game that often achieves success in it's purpose. It's only downfall is that it's one of my more "fiddly" games. I have only played solo so far, and it is outstanding for that, kudos on the Save system, although rather basic, it works fine. This is an extremely long game, with many difficult decisions to be made and a dark, but realistic theme. It really draws you in. Definitely recommend if none of those things worry you.

This is a solitaire game by design. By allowing each player to make decisions for the group at different times during the day(turn sequence) the focus is shifted from players controlling individual survivors to being stewards of the group. Personally, I felt like my investment in their stories was diminished because of it. When a survivor perished, one of our remaining members would go outside and conveniently find another to take their place. 

I found reading excerpts from the book of scripts tedious when there were no decisions to be made. This design offers a fair amount of decision points, but I didn't feel like there were enough to satisfy a group of four players. My rating is as a 3 as a multiplayer game. There are some great ideas here, but this isn't a game I would be anxious to return to the table.

Everyone should play this game. Of course it will not be a happy game but it is worth to think yourself into the place of the characters. The experiences created are multi-layered as you imagine what you would do surviving in a war torn city. The game doesn't just state that war is horrible, it let's you feel the consequences from a whole different level. I also played the computer game but it didn't touch me as much as the board game did. I would strongly suggest to play that game in school with young adults to keep awareness about the monstrosity that lies in war. With the journal they created this game can be easily experienced from a broader audience. Highly recommended!

The story told by this game is great, the book of scripts is full of tough moral dillemas. The overall table presence of this game is stunning, the artwork and the board are just superb. 

The only caveat is that the game is a too long for my liking (mainly due to the search phase that sometimes may drag). Other than that - great stuff. Highly recommended for everyone who loves story driven cooperative games. But I warn you - it's really hard to beat.

Extremely unhappy with Awaken Realms shipping and production. Would not back one of their games in the future.

Its mainly a solo game even though its marked a multiplayer game. Feels like the video game. 

You'll play the game a few times but after that it'll sit on the shelf collecting dust. It'll be very hard to get this game to the table often because of the dark theme.

Probably the only time you'll want to play this is if you are in a depressed mood.

Suggestion is to play this at a board game cafe.

Played the app twice, finished it on the second run.
The boardgame is rather faithful, hate the "rulebook". Mini's don't seem to have a real function, i'd rather have seen 3d resources. Basically it's an OK experience, but I don't see it as a coop with meaningful choices for more than 1 gamer. If I have to play solo I'd rather play the app, less space, less rules issues, and wel less luck (IMHO).

I admire how the devs wrote the rules: you can set the game up and start playing. Then, and hour or so later, you'll finish the first turn, cursing the choices you made because you didn't completely understand the mechanics of the game. Bottom line: the rules are terrible.

The gameplay, however, is enjoyable. I think it probably plays better as a solo game, but I enjoyed the two player experience.

The spacial aspect of the game (moving around the house and building items) is probably my favorite.

In the end, the game is a role playing game. If your group is unwilling to do so, the game will lose it luster sooner than later.

This is a tough experience if you hope to hold on to your humanity; saving someone can kill everyone in your group.  It'd pretty intense and a must play for anyone who enjoys being pulled into a story.

Only drawback, the non epic conclusion when you survive the game (and its limited replay-ability). Before playing the game i read the rulebook, and thought it was problematic (at least), then i played the game and it was just fine, almost all the info was on the cards. Maybe they could have the FAQ and the advanced rules at the end of the Journal (rulebook), it would not give that many spoilers and it would be easier to follow on.

I don't know if any game has ever stuck in my thoughts as hard as this one. What an absolutely amazing experience! So thematic, so captivating, and with stunning components. I love the game, and its gripping, stunning, and sobering narrative.

This is easily one of my favorite gaming experiences of all time.

!!! GENIAL !!! Asi, directamente, en mayúsculas. Tras un par de partidas introductorias de un par de turnos para ver mecánicas y componentes nos hemos metido de lleno con el juego. Una pasada, super-inmersivo, elegante en su desarrollo, fino en sus mecánicas........ y sencillo de jugar y difícil de dominar. Una gozada y muy rejugable

Edito: tras 5 partidas, todas ellas acabadas en derrota, me reafirmo en que es una maravilla de juego. Según acabo una partida ya tengo ganas de empezar otra

As many people said, this is not a game to just have fun with your friends with its dark background. However, it does not mean it is not an excellent game. You need to plan your actions carefully, and make hard sacrifices like leaving a bandage behind to get more food back to the home. Only thing I did not like is the luck factor on food traps or special items in the scavenging areas. 
Many people should play this game at least once to see the struggles and hopelessness of a civil war. The game succeeds in giving that and although it is not kid friendly, if you have teenagers, game will definitely show why people do not want to go into war.

-Love the game as an experience, however friends do not appreciate it as much as I do (Game is not for everyone).
-Alot of dice rolling and you are at the mercy of luck of the draw, which is not desirable in such a lengthy game.
-Very punishing game where you can do very little about.

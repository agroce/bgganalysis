Two things came out of my plays:

1) The visual element of predicting where your ultimate pathway to victory might crop up was a great challenge and I really enjoyed that.
2) The rotational element is bittersweet; I found that often I would want to setup a move that is coming, only to sit and tussle back and forth over the same region as someone else with them undoing what I'd done.

Overall, an enjoyable game, and I'd totally play again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to play.

Easy to see what your opponent is going for in the first few moves. If it lasts past 12 or so plays the options increase greatly and you really have to think through a lot of options before you take your turn or else you'll lose. Don't ever let your opponent get 3 in a row or you're in trouble. Games are over in 1-5 minutes. Nice little strategy game.

It's like tic-tac-toe but 5 in a row and an ability to rotate the quadrants.  A great game for keeping guests' kids entertained when we have guests over.

I think 5 is a fair rating for this.  It is a very simple mechanic abstract x-in-a-row game.  The quadrant rotations are cute, but not that awe-inspiring and really only lead to very specific tactics.  There seems to be consistent enough play to make it dull after a while.  Definitely no higher than a 5.

Quick & simple abstract that is a fossil from my pre-BGG gaming days. I like that it can be played with another player while someone else is setting up a big overhead game, and it's no major loss if you abort a game (or wait 30 seconds to start the main course) :D

Pentago est un jeu suédois composé de 4 carrés de bois présentant chacun 9 alvéoles (3x3) Ces carrés sont eux-meme disposés de facon a former un grand carré de 6x6. 

Deux joueurs vont tour a tour placer une bille (noire ou blanche) dans une alvéole libre, puis ils vont faire pivoter l'un des carrés d'un quart de tour dans le sens de leur choix. La seule restriction est qu'il n'ont pas le droit d'effectuer le mouvement exactement inverse du joueur précédent.

A very good "coffee table" game to get people involved in abstract strategy games. The rules are simple, but the strategy is much deeper. Comes in (block/base): birch/black, red/black and oak/oak. The oak board has been discontinued.

RATING: 7
Normally I prefer games be made of wood or something heavy, but in this case the red plastic version seems much better made and travels well.  The board doesn't come apart like the wood version does, and stows away with its plastic cover, which can be turned over and used to hold the marbles while playing.  The whole thing will fit into a cheap iPad sleeve for safest storage/transport.

I haven't decided how much I like this game so far.  I will give it a "7" for now, since I am usually "willing" to play.  I guess because I have only played it against my 8-year old daughter and her 10-year old friend, it is hard to decided if I like it or not - it seems too easy.  A little bit of depth and strategy, but there is a distinct advantage in going first.

I guess it could be compared to "Connect Four", but I thihk I like it a little better.

Certainly a quick game, unless you play against an AP'er who thinks WAY too much.

Tic Tac Toe with a twist.  I loathe TTT, but this game is enjoyable.  Nice abstract in which each player attempts to get 5 marbles of his or her color in a row while twisting one of the board's 4 quadrants 90 degrees each turn.  I like the simplicity of the game for kids while at the same time giving them practice visualizing how the landscape of the playing field can change with just a few turns.  Good logic practice for kids, decent game for adults too.  With the snap-on cover (Mindtwister version), this game becomes very portable and self-contained making this a good option to take to a restaurant or somewhere you'll have a wait.

(As of [b]?[/b] plays) The rotation mechanic is innovative and adds increased interest to the standard "Connect X" genre of games, but the novelty wears off after a few back-to-back plays. The wood version looks classy on a coffee table or shelf, though, which can entice non-gamers to give it a try.

This is a fun little two player strategy game that I found at Hobby Lobby on clearance of all places.  Its basically tic-tac-toe, except that you need 5 in a row on a 6x6 grid.  And to make things more interesting, its made of 4 adjacent 3x3 grids.  Every turn, you place a marble AND rotate one of the 3x3 grids 90 degrees in either order.  This requires some fair spatial reasoning skills.

The downside is that I can only play two or some games at a time.  My brain actually starts getting fuzzy if I try to play more. (and consequently, I can't win a game after the second one to save my life)

I only gave this a 6 because, after 10ish plays, the strategy does not spiral off into infinite depths like in chess (for example). That might be a plus for some, but it does mean that the game feels solvable after a while. Still, the board was high quality and the idea is clever.

Very easy to learn.  It plays quickly.  Not a bad game, for sure, but a couple times the winner almost won accidentally.  I'm not sure I get the strategy.  Also, it seems that when one person is about to win, there is this constant trade-off of turning a block one way, the next person turning it back.  The bits are pretty nice, but the wood quadrants in the set I got were totally unfinished.  Were talking splinters, here.  I'm off to buy some sandpaper!

For what seems to be another lame variation on five-in-a-row, Pentago actually is a satisfying spatial abstract.  The idea of having four quadrants to work in or rotate makes this type of game shine above its similar competitors. Still, a rather light abstract but one that I think would be good for anybody who enjoys spatial abstracts.

RATING: 3
A game to get five in a row, Pentago is a quick and simple abstract that is a fine game. Not very deep or crunchy, its most memorable part is the rotatable quadrants on the board. It is enjoyable, but classic Pente offers a better experience of connect five, and other more strategic abstracts offer even more.

RATING: 7
This is a tic-tac-toe style game but it's way more fun than expected.  Because of the rotation it's really hard to play defense and it really keeps you on your toes.  Lots of surprises.  It also plays very, very fast.  My wife prefers this to abalone but I'm the one who decides the ranking.  Great components but terrible quality box.

We've only been playing it for a week or so, but my five year old will win the game on a regular basis. At five the offense/defense is tricky and she can never quite focus on both at the same time, but she still likes it a lot (it probably helps that she can beat adults at it fair and square).

A really solid abstract strategy game.  Essentially "connect five" where players attempt to place five of their marbles in a row.  The "twist" is quite literal, however, because after each marble placement, you have to turn one of the four play sections 90 degrees.  You can literally learn to play in seconds, but there is still quite a lot of strategy and technique involved that give this game some legs as well.

It is similar to tic-tac-toe, Connect Four, and Pente.  The winner must get 5 marbles in a row.  However, after placing a marble, players must rotate a game square 90 degrees.  Consequently, the game board keeps changing.  It's a nice little twist, pun intended.

Overall, this game would be better as a mobile app than a board game.  When I want to play a in-person game with someone else, I don't think I would reach for this, even as a filler.

Fun, short, abstract game in which one must achieve five marbles in a row on a small board divided into quadrants of 9 spaces each.  The game obviously rewards experience with the victory patterns and the "look-ahead" becomes significantly easier with repeated play.  On a small board of this size, someone might even be able to master the tactical possibilities with a lot of play but I will never get that far.  Wooden components and marbles are very nice.

An okay, and quick, two-player abstract game. Feel free to make your own version out of cardboard, using go stones or checkers pawns.

Othello has the tagline "Seconds to learn, lifetime to master."

Pentago just body slammed Othello.  It's quicker to learn.  It's quicker to play.  It is a blast.  Many upgrades to Tic Tac Toe have been tried (not that Connect Four or Global Thermonuclear War are bad) but this does it just right.

Very quick games, stupid easy to teach, and encourages strategic thought. If you're not observant you will be caught out with an opponent's carefully considered plans. Connect Four on steroids, basically.

When I was first given this game it was quite fun and challenging but eventually I stumbled onto a glitch that pretty much ruined the game for me, I will still play everyother year or if someone brings it up and wants to know what it is, and I am not about to get rid of it, but I no longer "want" to play it, if that makes any sense.

We bought this on a whim - and love it.  It's very portable to pubs/restaurants, which is always a plus for us. I like the depth of this game despite the simple rules.

I have both the wood edition and the red plastic CE edition.  The CE is probably my favorite just due to the portability.  The top snaps over to keep all the marbles secure, and the rotating plates are permanently affixed to the board - very high quality.  If you're never going to take this anywhere out of the house, the wood version is beautiful and very solid.

I had high hopes for this elegant abstract with a neat pivoting mechanic.

Quite a fun little game.  Definitely has that "just one more" feel to it.  Plays in less than 5 Minutes, so fun if you are waiting for others.  I own the wooden version, which is pretty classic looking.  Not sure deep, but still quite a bit of strategy.  Highly recommend.

Pentago is a 2 player abstract strategy game with the goal of getting five in a row. The rules are this: on your turn, place a marble of your color, then rotate one quadrant of the board 90 degrees. First to have five in a row orthagonally or diagonally wins. That is all. It’s dead simple, but makes for a fun little puzzle. Games play in less than five minutes, so matches of multiple game have already become the norm. Pentago has also really caught on with my kids (9 and 7), so much so that they’ve even played some games on their own. That definitely makes it a winner in my book.

"Seconds to learn, years to master"

*edit

"Seconds to learn, days to master"

But really, it is a neat game and does teach spatial relations. First you learn the symmetrical ways to win, then the asymmetrical, then how to block, then how to use the rotations to win multiple ways so that your rotations can't be easily blocked... it's cool.

The reason this game is great - is that especially the wooden version - can be left out on a side-table to give guests something to do while you cook dinner or kids something to do other than watch TV or glue their faces to their smartphones. Go to Ebay and find some vintage marbles to make it even cooler. Bumblebees vs. snotballs... aggies vs. corkscrews. Your friends will have a nostalgia meltdown when they see the marbles of their childhood on a nice satin-finished wood game.

Abstract games are not my favorites, but I really like this one. It's pretty simple but deep enough and plays very quick.
There are only 4 ways of aligning the 5 marbles in a row to win, the gist of it is about deceptively setting up one of them while foreseeing your opposite intentions.
A nice mental exercise that doesn't require too much dedication.

RATING: 4
Pentago is an extra length noughts and crosses. It is played on a 6 by 6 board and players must achieve lines of 5. The 'twist' is that players may move the board as well as the pieces. At the end of each turn they take one quarter of the board and turn it 90 degrees. 
This is easy to learn, quick to play, and fun for quite a wide range of players. So why so low? Well, the depth is mostly an illusion. That board twisting thing sounds crazy but the opponent will always just turn it back unless you've made a mistake. So its impact is limited to one turn. Once you've got your head round that the first player advantage becomes enormous. So in the end no more real depth than connect 4 or similar games.

I don't think it's Pentago's fault, but I just don't enjoy it as much as many other abstracts. I can't put my finger on why. I imagine that it's just the flashbacks of suffering through Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect 4.

That all being said, spinning quadrants of the board is a clever mechanic.

RATING: 6
I would always rather play Pente, which this weakly resembles. It's too small and narrow a space to be that interesting for deep analysis. And the ability to undo the previous player's turn with the exact opposite turn makes the first player's position overly strong. I highly doubt that first player can lose (with decent play).

Still, it's fun for the first dozen or so plays, and would be a nice diversion for the less mathematical who still like quick abstracts. The win sometimes seems like a surprise to those unfamiliar with the game.

P.S. First player advantage can be equalized by second player choosing what color to play after first player makes his or her first move.

An interesting take on tic-tac-toe but I usually get thrashed at it because I can't spatially evaluate all the developing patterns especially when each field can revolve. I'm guessing others have figured out winning strategies but that would become too "chess-like" for me...I prefer a lighter and less strategic path albeit the losing one most times. A fun game really as a light play, probably not my cup of tea with a heavily strategic opponent though.

Good light little abstract game.  The rotating board is where this shines.  It adds an element where you must think a few turns ahead and observe the traps your opponent might also be trying to lay, this quality elevates it from a standard "connect 4" style game.  The quality of the board and locking lid are quite well designed and produced.

One of my three favourite 1v1 ... Brilliant 5 in a row idea , simple placement with a lot of strategy (no luck at all )
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
There is some strategy here, and it certainly has the feeling of a game I'd like to play a few time in a row against the same opponent, but there isn't much in the way of excitement or tension. The game is almost too short to warrant deeper study. Play can be devilishly quick if you're not paying attention, but even with evenly matched and experienced players, the board will fill up fast and therefore bring the game to a speedy resolution. What I do like is the basic cleverness of the game, with its rotating board segments. However, even there, limitations abound. The four centermost spaces on each segment are very powerful because they never change position. This leaves the board feeling even smaller than it already is. The problem is that, at its heart, Pentago is an elaborate game of tic-tac-toe. Full credit for making the concept work so well, but how much do I really want to seek out another game? -- unfortunately not very much.

RATING: 4
This is an interesting "twist" on classic tic-tac-toe, sort of combining in with five in a row games.  Still, despite its cleverness, in the end it's just a combination of tic-tac-toe and a five in a row game.

 Simple, elegant Swedish game that's deceptively deep. Similar to Pente (hence the similarities in name) but plays much quicker on smaller board with rotating quadrants.

Fast, portable abstract game. It's like a more advanced tic-tac-toe. However, it also seems like it could become repetitive after a number of plays.

Another solid 2-player game of getting 5-in-a-row but with a twist - literally. Takes good thinking skills.

Beautifully presented game, will look good on the coffee table, but not enough depth to hold interest. It encourages forward thinking, but personally prefer longer gameplay.  I thought it was expensive for very short gameplay with poor longevity.  I originally marked it at 5, but have more recently found that it is the last game I will pick up.

Conceptually cool, if somewhat dull in execution.  I could tell the Kidnomad wasn't really giving it much thought, and neither was I.  After one game he started brainstorming alternate rules: never a good sign.

Very fun, as long as you do not play it too frequently. Pentago may not be the game of choice for those seeking for a demanding mental challenge. Nevertheless, it's certainly not dull or trivial. Part of the fun is the unawareness of your opponent's plans, due to the amazing rotating mechanism. Once you get used to it and realize patterns, it loses a bit of its charm (but not too much, it's still a good game). Besides, the box is quite portable (albeit a bit deep, corresponds roughly to a stack of two Kosmos 2-player games), and the wooden components are great.
By the way, my copy (german edition by giseh, comes in a blue box)  came with bags instead of trays for the marbles. There's also no strategy guide included, just plain rules.

It really is as easy to learn as is advertised.  I haven't sat down to really dissect the game, but I worry that the emergent depth of strategy that is so enjoyable won't stand up to real scrutiny.  As of yet, however, this seems to be a great little abstract that packs a disproportionately big punch.

An abstract strategy game with four 3×3 grids arranged into a larger 6×6 grid. Players alternate placing marbles on the board, one player has white marbles and the other has black marbles. The first player to get five in a row on the entire 6×6 grid wins, but there is a new twist: Every time you place a marble you also turn any one of the game’s four boards (3×3 grid) 90° in either direction. The ever-changing game board makes the game all the more challenging. See Pentago XL for its four-player successor.

RATING: 8
The classic first edition of V:TES.. I still always refer to the card game as "Jyhad" ([size=7]I don't know why they changed it, but I guess the name was somehow thought to be politically incorrect or something.. or perhaps they just wanted to associate it better with the [i]Vampire: The Masquerade[/i] brand..? [/size] Anyway, to me, "Vampire" refers to the RPG and "Jyhad" to the CCG). A great game.

RATING: N/A
One of the best CCGs ever.. Thematic, strategic and fun. Used to play this a lot in my teens and occasionally later. Still have a bunch of old decks lying around.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
One of the greatest CCGs of all time. Wonderfully thematic. Controlling your vampire minions is fun and they feel like they have their own personalities. Really interesting to play with a lot of playes as all kinds of backstabbing and scheming add a lot to the game.

I rarely play this now, but I loved it when I did. It's long, a little complex and has player elimination, but despite this it's a wonderful game with tons of flavour. The political aspect of the game, combined with the predator/ prey mechanic, make this easily the best of the CCGs

Vampire CCG. Quite complicated and obviously a very dark theme.

RATING: 5.5
An extremely slow ccg developed early in the big ccg boom. Jyhad/Vampire pioneered some interesting mechanics and feature top notch artwork. The game really shined in multiplayer, though this often took far too long to play.

Simply put, the best CCG of all time. Two player games are all well and good, but games are made to play with multiple people. VTES is the only CCG intended for Multi-Player play, and this game is better with more players.

The combination of mathematical, social, strategical and tactical skills needed to play this game with the best makes it incredibly good. The drawback of this game is the steep learning curve. But if you have the mettle to climb that hill you will be greatly rewarded.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very good game, but it has too much errata. With complex rules and tons of errata this really needs determined players to make it work. With it's many flaws this is still the best CCG I have played. It's just damn hard to learn (and teach) this game. Not for casual play!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
For a while, this was the only gaming I kept up with.  Definitely, in my opinion, the best CCG ever produced.  And decently long-lived.  After Wizards abandoned the game in the 90's, White Wolf picked it back up and released another ~20 expansions from 2000 through 2010.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The most sophisticated of all CCGs.  Magic: the Gathering is fun, but it so supersaturated with cards that it's not the same game as it used to be.  V:TES is more political and strategic than Magic, which is action/tactic oriented.  V:TES Games are long, but in a satisfying way.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I remember playing this and really enjoying it as a multi-player game.  I feel like it would need quite a bit of work to be enjoyable nowadays... but who knows?  With luck, maybe we'll find out someday.

RATING: 10
Something totally different from anything else in my humble collection. This is the only CCG I've ever played and propably the only one I'm going to try. Very entertaining. I love the whole deck designing process. Got hooked pretty badly. Gets a little expensive along time...

Update after 5 years of playing. Still rating it 10! Weekly games, tournaments etc. Loving it every day!

This is the type of game I would probably get really obsessed with if I already wasn't a major magic player in a previous life. 

As is, it feels like a cheap knock off with convoluted symbol-based rules.

RATING: 6
The CCG closest to a board game feel, but too long and with reams of errata. I was mildly tempted by the latest edition, but I sold all my cards long ago.

RATING: 5.5
The most boardgamish of the whole CCG patrol, VTES suffers most for being not a CCG nor a boardgame. A game can last 150 minutes. You need four other people to play. But you need chase rares too, and there's no limit on the number of copies of a card in a deck!

I rescued 319 unplayed Jyhad cards (1994 Limited Edition) from a local store.  Ten of them are rare, with 65 vampire cards, 54 of which are unique characters.  A 48 page rule set is included.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is the best collectible card game ever devised. It's not luck-based (a game takes long enough to be able to play out the strategy that you've built your deck on), it has diplomacy and strategy, many ways to win a game, and has a great balance between becoming powerful and weak at the same time (by using your own life counters to play cards).

I played when it was Jyhad too.  I miss these card games... When I own a house?

A CCG that offered something different to Magic. A multiplayer negotiation experience with nice resource management mechanics. Sadly, as it happened with many more games, expansions killed it with a lot of unbalancing cards.

I remember playing this when I first moved to Washington.  Work had thankfully provided me with housing for the first month or so.  There was nobody I knew around in the hotel I was at for the first few weeks, so at night after work I just quietly played the game against myself to see what it was like.  Fond, quiet memories.  I haven't picked it up since moving to more permanent quarters, though.

This game was nice a change after MtG, multiplayer with more rigid rules but more variability in the deck building and playing style. Also a good player knows how to talk politics and get others in temporary alliances with him.

I have a voting and guns oriented Toreador deck that would need a lot of work on it. I have even participated with it in the finnish national championships of V:tES in summer 2013 (lost all plays though).

RATING: 9
Vampire: The Eternal Struggle is my favorite card game ever printed. The only reason I didn't give this game a 10 is that playing with less than 4 players is not very good. This is the game that Richard Garfield made after Magic the Gathering. It is a heavily social game, with importance on seating order and cross-table partnerships. You didn't need a ton of crazy rare cards to be competitive, either. With 2 starter decks, you could make a very good deck. It was a unique and engaging game, and even years after being out of print, it still has an active tournament scene.

RATING: 9
The running joke in our game group is "Let's Play Vampire!" but we never do. I really need to get them to play this.

Vampire is a hard game to teach and to learn, but once it clicks it's very good, even better than Magic for larger groups. An elegant stealth system, a brutal combat system, and a multiplayer-focused voting sytem all help make the game incredibly interactive.

Some of the art is just terrible though.

I've only played a single game of this, and that was with a friend's demo decks. The mechanics are definitely interesting (this is Richard Garfield we're talking about here), but this game is just about impossible to get into at this point since I think it is currently out of print. Maybe they'll release a new version?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
When it came out I thought Jyhad was far superior to MtG, basically because the game was quite playable straight from starter decks.

We always played 4-5 player with starter decks only and it was pretty satisfying, albeit slow-paced (because of the lack of any deck optimisation).

Wouldn't touch it now.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Though the base game (Jyhad) has some printing errors and cards which are not always that clear to understand it is a great (ccg) card game and probably the best multiplayer card game I ever played. The game realy shines in a 5 player game but 4 player is also very enjoyable.

This is how it began. Jyhad feels and probably was the beta to V:TES. Wording wasnt' fixed, printing errors with colours and icons on the cards. A bunch of erratas. (Even the name was changed to Vampire: the eternal struggle. Was Jyhad too offensive? lol But the game was allready there and tha'ts what counts.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The best and deepest TCG ever in my oppinion!
V:TES has deep rules, beautiful combat and politics, fast pacing (althoug games tend to go long. 60-120min) and the characters and artwork give you a sense for the World of Darkness that can take you all in.
The learning curve is very steep. But worth it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
When White Wolf took the wheel in their hands things started changing in a marvelous way!
Most obvious where the card and Icon design changes. I didnt like it at the time and its still a factor of confusion for new players.
But the good thing was that suddenly, with every expansion new faces of the WoD and Vampire Society were included. Like the Blood Lines, the Ebony kingdom, other supernaturals, Hunters(!!!)
The gameworld has by now become so vivid that V:TES completely satisfies my need to play the Pen and Paper version of the Bloodsuckers.

I LOVED PLAYING THIS GAME IN THE 90s!!! I developed a "Self-Help" deck that removed all cards with titles that seemed like a negative personality trait and it was the most interesting game I ever played. I was an ego-less Methuselah that spent the whole game competing over vampire influence and re-directing attacks. I almost won, except I had nothing in the deck that would actually fight off a direct attack once we were down to 2 players. COOL GAME.

Eternal is about right for the length of the game, with more than three players. With more players downtime can strain even the strongest boredom threshold.

RATING: N/A
IMO, a fundamentally better - but harder - game than M:tG. Hindered by the requirement for 3+ players... and even more so by its early-day sales of fully random decks; in M:tG, such things could limp along, but in V:tES, they're nearly unplayable.

[Keep in mind I stopped playing M:tG in the 90s and V:tES around 2002. Both games have likely evolved since then.]

Nostalgia for this game has had me purchase many thousands of cards over the past few years. One of the finest player communities I've found atop a game that is a ravening, bloated mess, and all the more fun for it's inconsistencies and oddities of design. Look for Facebook groups and get engaged if you want to play this game- the communities are still kicking.

RATING: 8
Not an easy game to get into, but with some patience (or some help from current players) you'll be able to get the hang of this excellent game. 

This is one of the most social, multiplayer CCGs I've ever seen and the table dynamics really distinguish it from its peers.

RATING: 7
Lots of Jyhad cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The best multiplayer CCG ever created. The only other game coming remotely close to the VTES is Dune the CCG, but that one is almost completely forgotten and much harder to obtain (not that getting a decent VTES collection is exactly easy these days). Hopefully, we would see the game transformed to a LCG format at some point in future.

Update: Rating lowered. Despite being the best multiplayer CCG, the game suffers from critical problems:

- far too large card pool, significant part of which is worthless cards that are never used in either competitive or noncompetitive environment

- too many niche mechanics

- generally imbalanced across disciplines, clans, archetypes

After all, it is not really surprising the game has not been (and would never be) resurrected in an LCG format. It is a relict of the 90s, excellent in some ways, but hopelessly outdated in others.

My favorite among the CCGs.  This game is way better than Magic.  However, it still suffers from endless expansions and keeping up by spending more on cards to add to a huge collection.

The game was fun to play for a couple of times.  However, If you get behind there is no real way to get caught up.  Our game group has found that if you are behind by the half-way point, you are not going to win.  We prefer a more balanced game.  Also, it is another collectable game to kill the wallet.  Overall, it was fun for a play or two, but it did not keep our interest.  Someone into collectable card games would probably appreciate it more.

Had some of the best and worst of CCGs. In the good column, it was made for multiplayer. It used a novel attack left/defend right mechanic. The ability to direct attacks otherwise was a special and could really manipulate the game! Best of all, it had muliple things to vie for such as deadly fighters, political positioning, and so on. But it also tended to be slow and not particularly exciting... and the whole system of matching your vampires disciplines felt like an accounting exercise just to copy the RPG it was based on.

A recent acquisition (Jan 2005) after I promised myself I wouldn't be lured into any more collectable card games. Dammit. Only played with the starter decks so far.

RATING: 8
Had great fun with this game in the mid 90’s.  Offered more interesting gameplay than Magic, and the vampire and combat themes are well integrated.  It has some problems: the game takes too long, is slow-paced, and certain strategies are (were?) far too powerful.  Also, once a player is very reduced in blood pool, his ability to do things in the game is reduced because the blood pool is used both as health and mana, leading to some stagnation and overly-defensive play.  But the fun mechanics, variation, and style make up for it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I don't want to admit how many deck I purchased, but I loved this game for both the mechanics and the art.  I tend to favor less luck in games than Garfield, and found this game works really well without shuffling, so long as all players have access to the same libraries.  (We didn't have as much time to play as I would have liked, and that tweak allowed us to fully express strategies in every game, modified only by the opponent's strategy/sequence, which still produced fun, unpredictable games!)

An old CCG.

Interesting vampire card game. I love the theme of this game. Would probably of got into it it if I had players to play with at the time it came out. At the time, the people I hanged around with was mostly Magic: The Gathering and Warhammer 40, 000.

My two cousins showed me this game. I found the mechanics of interesting. Too bad this game is hard to find. I wonder if it's possible to get a complete set.

I might look into one day.

*UPDATE*

Recently got a complete starter box of Jyhad which include 10 starter decks.

*UPDATE 2*

Now own more Jyhad plus cards from expansions.

Approximately 1,000 cards. I haven't counted them, but based off of another user's measurment of 1.25"=100 cards, I am estimating that amount. Approximately 20% are Vampires. I used to play when this first came out. Includes cards from the original V:TES, Sabbat, Ancient Hearts and Dark Sovereigns. GM me if you want specifics.

**UPDATE**
Actual count: 1,055 cards of which 240 are vampires.

I have over 16 inches of cards with the following ready to play, pretty competitive decks: Toreador, Ventrue, Tremere, Malkavian, Gangrel, Princes (all votes and princes), press gang (cheap vamps), babes (all female vamps), and Brujahs and guns (lots of weapons). Plus have an unspoiled starting deck (unmixed from when I bought it) and 6 inches of un-decked cards. Most of the cards are Jyhad backed and are in very good to unplayed condition. The collection was mostly hand created so there are not a million commons and few others.

Best multiplayer ccg ever, great combat system too.
The only CCG that allows players to play in  all tournaments with any published set. No worries about formats or card restrictions. Very few cards banned.

RATING: 6
This game can take a LONG time to play if with many players.  If you're a fan of White Wolf's Vampire RPG, you ought to try it.  Subtle, and there's always lots to do on your turn, which can lead to a lot of downtime with more players.  Captures the feel of The Masquerade.

I got heavily into this game while in college (as part of my snubbing of MTG).  It was a blast. I loved every minute of those two hour games, though it took a while to finally figure out what I was doing.  Lots of interaction, both on and around the table.  Certainly left with a sense of accomplishment at the end of the night.

RATING: 2
Supposedly, V:TES is an absolute blast if you play it with a group of more than two people.

Sadly, I never got to experience it that way.  In a two-player setting, it was functional, but only barely, and the political aspects of the game were completely absent.

RATING: 7
This is a really evocative, thematic CCG. I never played any of the World of Darkness RPGs, so everything in this CCG was new to me. It has a different feel from Magic: The Gathering but of course it owes a great deal to MTG's design.

RATING: 6
I love ccg's.  This one's fun, but it tends to run a bit too long sometimes with a lot of see-sawing in terms of advantage.  Thus, it's rated lower than Magic and Middle-Earth.  Haven't played in a while, but I would like to get back into it. Better with more players.

RATING: 9
Since I have played many card games (from Magic: the Gathering to Rage!) I can hardly say that Vampire is the best game of all. 

A game suitable for two players as well as for seven must have a strong and confidence rules system. It works perfectly and is quite fast and funny when you master the basics.

The estrategic options shown by Vampire give the players many way of winning a game. Bleeding with massive vampire attacks or with the voting options just put the eye of the game in how you manage your blood and how many "vampires" you need to summon from your crypt.

A game that you enjoy from the very first play and, years later (yes: YEARS later), still surprising the players must be good.

A lot of interesting mechanics despite the vampire theme, but often proved quite rare getting anyone else interested or willing to spend time on a game.

Stealth in the early versions however approached or exceeded being a broken ruleset on most occasions.

RATING: N/A
Really enjoyed the mix of political & schemes mixed with combat on this. Would really enjoy this coming back digitally on pc/tablets/consoles as it's quite fun & different for a CCG with a ton of exquisite theme of vampires fighting for control of a region.

A great multi-player CCG, probably one of the finest ever designed.  Takes a lot of time, though (120 minutes?  Uh...)

We once played an 8 player contest that ran for over 5 hours.  Loved every minute, though!


EDIT:  My collection of the base set is COMPLETE!  Wow, that only took 13 years.  


EDIT:  The lion's share of these lost due to water heater leak.  I am gifting my collection to a friend, because now the set is incomplete due to a few cards actually being in decks at the time they were ruined.

Interesting first try at a CCG larger then 2 players. Waaaay to much trying to happen here. It's an elimination game so when your out the game could easily go on for hours why you watch. Lots of deal making for votes but still just to clunky. But it did capture the feel of what Vampire the Masquerade was going for at that time so kudos for that.

RATING: 7
This game is incredible, but you MUST play it with the right people. I got alienated by a former national champion in my local league and one of his buddies who whined like children whenever things didn't go as they planned. They caused the group to break up a month after they joined it, starting more table arguments than I had ever seen in my life. Still got the cards... looking for new groups to play with, or a new home with people who want a fast playable collection good enough for building a few competitive decks, whichever comes first.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
After several more plays, I daresay its one of the best CCGs out there. Still cumbersome and more complex than your average CCG and longer playing time(i've seen a game go for 1 hour) but its very very tense and very atmospheric and the cards are well though out and great art too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Have always enjoyed this more than Magic, due to the less expansive cardset, and the political aspect which makes the game far more tactical, and less dependent on the particular decks brought to the table by players.

RATING: 6
I am not a vampire/goth enthusiast and do not play the Vampire RPG, yet this *is* my favorite CCG; I feel the Jyhad game engine is the best CCG ever designed, and it plays well with any # of people. Since you almost always keep 7 cards in your hand, it doesnt have the frustration of not being able to do something because of lack of cards. The combat rules are simple, yet more full than &#039;I damage you x points, you damage me x points&#039;, by taking into account range, and type of weapon damage. I only wish I could find more people interested in Vampire, than in MTG.

A hybrid of a story-driven RPG and a CCG - an odd match that doesn't work for me.  Slow paced, unwieldy, and suffers from all the usual awkwardness of multiplayer CCGs.  I've heard a lot of praise for the art on the cards, but I always thought it was mostly awful.

I would have liked to play this game more, but my group wasn't keen. There's no point in beginning now, the sheer amount of expansions makes this title an "avoid at all costs" game. That goes well with all the other CCGs.

To me, this is the best of the best in CCGs.  The gameplay is tense and the decision making can be brutal.  Countless strategies can be used.  This really is a first rate game.  Most cards are from original Jyhad version, have lots of card from some of the early expansions as well.

The only CCG I play, though I haven't played much since moving from Seattle. It is incredibly complex, with a high barrier to entry in terms of understanding the cards. However, it is easily the best multiplayer card game in existence, with so much political back and forth and is incredibly strategic. 

I'm basically an ANR junkie these days, but VTES is still a fantastic game. Wish I had time to play it more.

Bought some Jyhad back in the day, then sold all of them. Found a bunch of precons from a sale and taught the wife the ropes. It is a very fun multiplayer CCG. Heartily recommend grabbing a few precons if you run into them for cheap and sucking blood with your friends.

RATING: 6
Vampire was fun but had a lot of the problems common to Magic and other CCGs of this vintage, plus a few unique ones of its own.  The multiplayer was really good, it was probably the best implementation of multiplayer CCG at the time.  The only problem with it was who you were up against at the beginning of the game depended on seating order, so the beginning of a duel looked a lot like a game of musical chairs as people awkwardly jockeyed to sit somewhere advantageous.  It also took really long for a CCG, easily twice as long as magic.

I have to many cards and it does not become more interesting. For some reason the game engines all seem alike.
For expample, if you want to build a corruption deck, it will have to become very specific otherwise it will not work and you'll be blown away by Tremere and Brujah or voted to death by ventrue. This has the effect that you can only build one or two types of corruption decks.
a bit anoying. Also the basic cards that you need are so frequent that it becomes boring (wake, ivory, skin)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This game may be terrible. Yet, I play it relatively often. The key to enjoying it is to play it with people who aren't the general VtES community which is largely composed of pretentious, cliquey, pains in the ass. I like the many routes to victory and the diversity of clans. I really hate the tournament level play, primarily because it eliminates most of what I like about the game.

VTES is one of the best multi-player political card games.  I’ve always been a fan of vampires and of white wolfs take.  Took years to adjust to how different it is from MTG, including slower pace and longer game times.  It plays a bit more like a board game with CCG like pre-game.

A really good cardgame for five people. Intense, political, a huge variety of working archetypes and yet a generalist toolbox deck can function as well. Down sides are that you really need five to have a proper game and that is takes usually up to 2 hours with player elimination possible very quickly. 

Would not always play, but with the right people who have invested in the game it can be fantastic and magical even when you are doing badly, indeed some of my most memorable moments have been from games where I've had abysmal positions and yet have managed to leverage some gains out of the table.

The best CCG going, multi player & multi strategy.  I have played it since 1994 when it first came out, and have enjoyed every game I have played (360 plays and rising).

This is by far the best multi-player ccg that can be purchased. I've been playing since it was brought to the market in 1995 and is played more than any game I own. I run the play group for VtESinLA.org and we play every other weekend for about 12-15hrs and avg. 10-20 players on a regular basis. This game has been reinvigored since White Wolf took it over from Wizards of the coast, and has done a remarkable job in keeping the players happy with great new expantions. The game is VERY complex, a LOT of cards to learn as well as it's fare share of eratta, but if you like multi-player CCG's and you are not playing VtES, you are robbing yourself of the the best CCG ever made.

Just my 2 cents :)

I always had fun playing this, though nowadays it's just my wife and I who play it, which isn't as much fun as a larger group.  I do still enjoy just playing with the deck construction and strategies, though, so even though I'm not still playing it, it still gives me some enjoyment.

Of all the CCGs I have, I own tons of these cards (Jyhad & VtES), know the rules & have NEVER played a game.  But I've built many decks--many, many decks.  I want to play this game--I really do!  But of my gamer friends, none seem to be interested so my cards sit; waiting to be shuffled & dealt into hands.  I base my score on the rules, card mechanics & art.  It is the one CCG that dies, resurrects, dies & keeps rising from the grave.  It truly lives up to it's theme not only in gameplay but in it's history as well.

This is a pretty unusual ccg, as it is pretty heavy and best played in multiplayer format. Usually 4 people is best. All of my cards are old. I played it back in the 90s a little bit, but not since then. I see it at Gen Con every year and think about playing it some more, because I do remember that I liked it quite a bit.

The best multiplayer CCG, but you need at least 4 players to really enjoy it. The game is at it&#039;s best with 5-7 players. Two main reasons for this to be the best multiplayer CCG are: 1) you can get a good deck without spending too much. The best cards are common or uncommon, and the rare cards are mostly just funny and wierd. Often a good deck can be build only using cards from two pre-constructed starter decks, at least with Camarilla Edition starters. 2) it&#039;s very well balanced, there is no such deck that is always victorious, every deck always have a weak point too. Therefore the game is interesting even before the actual game begins, since the seating order really makes a difference.

Played many times in college as "Jyhad".  Great game with the right group.  Not so great with newbies and you have to explain everything as it takes away some metagame.  We played this a lot to show we weren't MtG sheep.  Lots of fun while drinking Black Russians or Kahlua late Saturday night.

When you can win the game, without knowing what you do, the first time you play, it tells you that the game might not be that good. I don't like the flow of the game and the cards. I don't like the fact that you must sacrifice life points to put people into play. I rather play nobody and be able to hold 30 turns instead, the game will end sooner.

There are still some interesting mechanics for example, I loved the voting mechanics. I also loved, in multiplayer the circular attack pattern: You are hunting a player and being hunted by a player. Nevertheless, there would have been far better ways to make a game of influence at the vampire court.

Finally, it would have been wonderfull if they could have made a game compatible to be played with mages and werewolf. I would have played mages for sure.

I played this hardcore, in tournaments, Gencon, etc. back in the mid 90's  The original Jyhad set was an excellent game except players could get ousted from the game very quickly and then have to sit around waiting for the next one. With the V:TES reprint, expansions (and lack of playtesting thereof) and tournament play the game was ruined. Utter rule lawyerism, exceedingly degenerative deck design and waffling by a seemingly headless design team for the expansions spelled the end of the game for our group. Another issue is that the best decks have not simply 10-15 rares as in most ccg's, but upwards of half to all of a 60 card deck will be rares, 20 Nephandus the mage, 15 Kiss of Ra, etc.  So the game has worse card economy than Magic, due to the lack of identical card restriction. Buying the game, especially for those of us that started with Jyhad, was an exercise in utter frustration: changes to card backs, incessant reprints in newer sets. Love most of the art though, it's scary!

RATING: 8
This game was a blast! I loved playing this game. It too suffered from the CCG boom/flood of the early 90's but was still a great game to play. It was one of those CCG's that you didn't need the super rare $chinga$ cards in your deck to b e successful. Unfortunately, this is the game that crushed my competitive spirit, as it was during this game I saw the ugly side of competitive gaming. That was the day I said "fuck it".

I hate CCG's but this is a true masterpiece. I guess this is the only CCG where you can win with a terrible deck or just by good talking and manipulating. Seriously about the games - Ive seen a lot and I played a lot but I cant even imagine a better game. Also the best combat sytem Ive seen in board and card games.
Of course i understand some bad ratings - game is complicated, requires 4 or more players, also you need to like World of Darkness.

I was deep into magic at the time (94' I think) and was accustomed to buying stupid amounts of cards and piling them into boxes.  My magic group briefly flirted Jyhad but gave up on it quickly.

RATING: 5
The best multiplayer CCG ever made, and great in friendly as well as competitive environments. Back when I played, it would have been a 9. I rate it a 5 because I don't play CCGs/LCGs anymore, but if someone hands me a deck I'd consider playing.

The predator/prey mechanic is simply brilliant -- every player has an incentive to interact with at least two other players every turn, and their interactions affect everyone at the table as they see who's going to fall next and plan accordingly. All of the core gameplay is enjoyable, and it bucks a lot of trends in Magic -- there's no arguing about timing, and having no four-card limit opens up all sorts of possibilities.

Like Magic, the main reasons I stopped playing Jyhad/V:TES were money (too costly to keep up with new releases) and the lack of a strong local player network. I went out with a solid performance in a GenCon tournament just before they restricted Misdirection, and I probably won't come back to V:TES -- but I do miss it.

Interesting and engaging game which does it's theme brilliantly and which introduces novel political and negotiation elements to the CCG genre. It plays almost like a multi-player conquest board game - people sit round a table, trash talking and biting chunks (literally, in this game) out of their immediate neighbors. Has downtime issues because a players' turn is often only of interest to those direct neighbors, and that in turn reduces the people round the table for those not engaged to talk to. I also have a faint distaste for CCGs in general. But this is probably the best one I've tried.

A beautifully deep multi-player CCG. Functions best with 4 or 5 players, do not attempt with more, playable with 3 and requires specific decks to work well with 2 players (it's far from unplayable but the meta-game is skewed strongly toward direct attack decks with lower player counts). 

The biggest strength of the game is the deck interaction with left/right binding between players. The extreme environmental variation leads to less reliable 'best decks' and low (for a CCG) application of group-think to individual games. There is a requirement for reasonably equalised investment in the game's outcome in order to get the best out of it- the tournament scene, although small, exists to moderate this in the most part without reward influencing behaviour. 

The latest sets play faster out of the box and well laid out. Unfortunately there is a brutal amount of errata on early cards.

The best multi-player CCG ever made.  Thematically very strong with an interactive, exciting game play.  IMO the Jyhad (original set) is all one really needs to play and enjoy this.

This is by far the best TCG I've played. The artwork may not be to everyone's taste. And the same goes for the theme. But the gameplay is magnificent. Especially the fact that you can play this with more than 2 players. I played this game with friends when I was in college. We played it a lot and it never got old. Only stopped playing because after college we all went in different directions. This game has more depth than magic.

We got a bunch of packs and starters for nothing because this card shop I worked for got them to use to demo the game. But little did WOTC know that besides a few Magic players in the area it was literally a baseball card shop. So we kept the cards and played one big group game. It was kinda fun, a little hard to grasp. We went back to Magic the next night and never looked at the cards again. I have no idea what happened to them.

RATING: 8
This is the only CCG I ever bothered with because, at least for a while, it was the only CCG where games (and by extension, tournaments) could be won with decks built by commons and uncommons.

But that was not the strength of this game. The real strength of this game was the absolutely brutal metagame. This was like M:TG with a hardcore negotiation component. Games would be filled with deals, alliances, betrayal and backstabbing. And all of this, of course, fit wonderfully with the World of Darkness vampire theme.

Sadly, in the past five years, the game went down the path of all CCG's - new expansions came out that were essentially attempts to expand the customer base and make money, and in that moment, rules changes were made and cards were printed that undermined the game. Suddenly it was more about who could obtain those game-winning ultra rares, and not about who could build the cleverest deck. And the rules changes, which restricted how decks could be built, or added unnecessary new mechanics that undermined the original game, were the final straw.

I sold off my collection of about 5000 cards back in 2004 and haven't looked back. I sometimes wish I had kept some of my better decks--it was great fun playing my Assamite untap & rush deck (Fatima with an Assault Rifle and Freak Drives) and my Harbinger Slaughterhouse deck and my Lasombra slime deck (classic stealth bleed, bleed bounce,  agg. damage for combat.) Still, there isn't really anyone around that I could play it with. And that's just fine.

This game being collectible means the gameplay is fundamentally broken.  The process of figuring out what combinations are better is a puzzle not a game.  Sitting by yourself constructing a deck is the definition of solitary play (a puzzle).

Beyond that the business model of collectible games is deplorable.  It is a form of gambling targeted towards children.  It adds no benefit to the gameplay is done specifically to milk as much money from people as possible.

We had a bit of fun with this - gleefully mixing our old Jyhad sets with the later V:TES boosters - but the theme got old pretty soon. Our Vampire RPG campaign suffered a similar fate. I suppose we were a bit too old for the angst.

Deck construction was a blast, though, with real opportunities for innovative strategies.

RATING: 7
A good game of vampires and vampiric control. I like to play it once in a while, but since I&#039;ve stopped TCG&#039;s I don&#039;t like spending time constructing new decks... and the gameplay of this game is very dependent on changing decks and surprising your oppenents
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A cult classic amongst CCGs. Highly revered for its focus on multiplayer and its implementation of the VTM theme.
You play as an elder vampire waging a proxy war against another elder. Victory is decided by depleting your prey's (player to your left) "pool" of resources while at the same time protecting yourself from your hunter (player to your right) which should clue you in on why the game excells at multiplayer as you'll quickly be forming alliances with other players to watch their backs in exchange for their help.

This is lost when playing 1-on-1, but the game is a viable two player experience, it just changes the vibe a bit and is obviously going to reward direct confrontation over political backstabbing.

Downsides are the iconographical design choices (what did the thing with the squiggy arrows mean?) and the rules overhead. The concept of action stealth & interception, every discipline having its basic and superior version and a lot of stuff that is heavily dependant on your knowledge of the core material (Diablerie, why a Justicar gets more votes than a primogen, etc.). This is not a newbie friendly game, it is going to take more than a few tries to get into it for anyone not heavily invested in the theme.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of the most enjoyable games I played during the CCG period of my life. I'm a roleplayer and a sucker for the theme, and the whole must-attack-the-player-to-your-left thing is pretty interesting. The combat between vampires is really the highlight of the game - it feels really visceral and tense.

Unfortunately, the game is very aptly named: in our group things tended to slow to crawl as the negotiations really ramped up, with the result that games just lasted foreverrrr. And the player elimination always left a couple of people slogging it out for the title while everyone else twiddled their thumbs. 

Still, I've had plenty of good times playing this one. With the release of the ready-made clan decks, we've had a lot more fun just playing with these non-streamlined decks than we ever did playing the with tricked-out personalised decks back in the day.

Another good CCG that I no longer play :-(  I was disgusted when they decided to rename this game and changed the cardbacks, thereby rendering my collection worthless -- F.U. WotC!

RATING: 2
It feels too big of a world for beginners. It took me forever to learn the rules and it felt way too heavy for a card game. It seems this game would've benefitted from some streamlining. Also, it irritates me deeply that the game allows EVERY SINGLE ACTION to be blocked. Ok, not all, because you can do one thing without any blocking, but this is the smallest part of the game. This mechanism feels incredibly frustrating and annoying.

Also, the theme is not very attractive to me, but that's very personal, so not a big deal.

RATING: 9
The best multiplayer CCG.  Has grown a little heavy with age (and it didn't start light!) but well worth the time.  Biggest flaws are fairly long play time, player elimination and high complexity.  Usually some players are stuck in a slow-death position too, which isn't a lot of fun.  Best traits: excellent multiplayer structure (inhibits, while not preventing, leader bashing), generally excellent art, very strong thematic elements, cinematic quality to the fights (not just random card effects), multiple strategies to victory and no "mana" in-hand.  If you can't get behind the story, you will probably hate this game.  But if you can, and can deal with the game's negatives, then it's outstanding. This is the only CCG my group still wants to play.

I never liked the RPG, but I loved the card game. I tried it with lots of skepticism (it seemed one of these games that tried to drink from the fame of MtG), but I was surprised to find a strategic, fun and somewhat deep game.

I had very few cards, not even enough to have a decent deck. Now I wished I had more interest in this game (even though I fear I would have discovered it was not as good/fun game as I think now).

I played when it was first published (its name was Jyhad back then). Probably they destroyed the game with the many addons that came later.

RATING: 5
Only played the once, with 3 players, and was underwhelmed. The idea is that you use your blood pool to get out units, but if you lose the last blood in your pool, you die. So you can't get out too many units. Lots of small units seems to be key as the chump units help you do multiple attacks, some of which will be undefended. You attack the player on your left, leaving units behind to defend against possible attacks from the player on your right. Or not. This circular roundabout is my main problem with this genre - things can be slow and stalemate-y because the format encourages you to just commit to defense and let other people attack and wear each other down. Leaving the last one standing. There's no doubt some interesting deck-building you can do as lots of event cards provide extra oomph to vampires with the right attributes. The artwork is dated and seems amateurish compared to what FFG are doing these days though. The game-play is one of a simple put a unit forward, put a defender forward (or sacrifice a blood from your pool), assign damage simultaneously after card play. Not too much to get excited about. All of which means I'm not much enamoured with the idea of exploration.

An ageless masterpiece.
Simply the best multiplayer card game I played and one of the best multiplayer games I played.

I completed the first old set, Jyhad (in more copies) and I created 21 themed decks - 3 per clan - for playing with friends. The game is incredible, at his best in multiplayer (5 players is the top), with an elegant mechanic and a deep, strong theme, rich in details and perfectly implemented.
Deckbuilding is IMMENSE, absorbing, immersive. No cards limit... and incredibly well balanced. Simply astounding.

For me the best CCG together with Magic - TG and one of the best horror-themed games ever.

RATING: 6
mostly, a piece of trash.

Meant as a multiplayer game, with rules to force you into attacking only 1 player. Yet these rules are not done well enough, as all other players in the game can affect a single player negatively.

Too much reliance on other players to do "their job" properly in the game. You ultimately have little ability to control the game if your partner player is not playing well.

Card powers have way too much variance.

The timing and reactions to card play is not consistent. Some actions that are played as reactions to someone else's actions are lost if countered, yet others are not lost.

Card text is not complete or consistent and leaves you needing to fiddle through the rule book for meaning.

The game has an enormous amount of down time both between turns and between games. A huge problem for a multiplayer game. With games running upwards of 3 hours, a player eliminated in the first 30 minutes would have over 2 hours to wait until they are playing again. Not at all a fun game for a group to play.

A very poorly designed game that after so many years still hasn't fixed the most basic problems. I imagine the only reason it has stuck around so long is the typically fanatical devotion of 'vampire' fan boys.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
The best 4+ player CCG out there.  Only length and learning curve keep this from being a 10.  The subtle art of balancing an attack-left table so that everything breaks in your favor sets VTES apart from the many multiplayer games where everyone just chases the leader.  The combination of varied deck-types, tactics, and diplomacy is excellent.

RATING: 5
Rating after 14 hours of play. Terribly disappointing. What I'd heard about this game for 15 years did not prove itself in play. When did WoD vampires turn into a hack'n'slash? It did not seem the political/diplomatic lives of vampires were viable at all, and it boils down to who has the sickest repetetive/abusive combat/discipline cards/combos. 

After more plays, the game is proving just too mean-spirited for me at this point in my gaming life. There was a time when unbridled aggression between players was a thrill - now it's just unpleasant. I'm not interested in a game that encourages players to team up on one player, and 4 hours of take-that, where you are only actively playing about 10% of the time is simply not worth the significant time investment (3 hours+ per game with 5 or 6 players). This game, by design, [b]takes too long to play.[/b]

I'll quote Richard Garfield on cardgame length:
[i]"It is vital that trading card games not be long. A large part of the appeal of the games is that when you replay them with small changes to your components that they play very differently. If my time is exhausted after one game then I can't really appreciate that."[/i]

I would actually compare Jyhad most with Spellfire. They both are about the same age, with similar amounts of too-many-expansions that threw too much crap into the metagame, and have fairly baffling rules adjudications, even for expert players.  

Thematically, the card game breaks the fundamental connections to the WoD by not allowing princes/politics to stand against combat power. A 2-life wussie vamp can easily spank a 10-life elder vampire's ass in one turn with all the cycling of combat cards, and more importantly can stop the elder from doing even one political action, because he can actually react and get the elder in combat thereby rendering the political aspect of the game moot.

I've been playing Vampire since it first came out way back in '94 and i think it's a great testament to the game that it can still suprise and delight me after all this time. I love the fact that there is no 'killer' card, that whether you win or lose isn't dependant on a single card draw and the high level of player interaction. There are too many strategies to count and it has a great theme (and i'm not normally a fan of Vampire type themes)

Without a doubt the most perfectly balanced CCG there is! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
My favorite CCG (even though I suck at it). The mechanics are great, there is a lot of politics going on on the table and the game is so much fun that the fact that I've never won a single match doesn't even matter.

Also it is VERY well balanced for many players. Actually is the only card game that achieves this IMO. Even if everybody on the table decide to gang up on one player it's not possible to completely stall him. All other CCGs (that I've played) are tailored for duels, really.

Update(8/08): A very deep CCG that is tough to learn and only really shines with at least 4 players.  The (3) rating is a declaration that I honestly have no expectation that I will ever play a game of this again in my lifetime. The effort required to re-aquaint myself with the rules and cards enough to put together enough decks for a group of players to play is too much of a barrier to bringing this one out. Brilliant game back in the day though...

One of the best CCGs available, it's relatively inexpensive and presents a game dynamic that is unique and outstrips all the others I've played. 

Of particular interest is its huge potential for tactics and strategy at all stages of the game, from deck design to execution. During execution, diplomacy is a key component, and it's built right into the mechanics of card play itself. 

A truly masterful game. Its only flaw is the moderately high learning curve.

Anyway, for what it is, it's probably pretty good.

Like Magic, we got sucked into this.  The games were long and it was really painful to loose when certain cards didn't show up from your deck.  Like Magic, disputes over rules ruined games, and the collecting was getting expensive.

Oh how I loved this game back &quot;in the day&quot;. A much better game than &quot;Magic&quot; - though curiously wasn&#039;t that successful in my place of residence. I&#039;m a fan of the RPG as well though, so that could be some bias there. 
But I always thought the addition of &quot;unique&quot; cards and the fight for then made the game really interesting. Jyhad didn&#039;t have the &quot;greasy geek&quot; factor that Magic had either ( although it DID have the top-hat-wearing, white-face-painting, leather-pants-wearing goth geek factor - which is almost worse ... )

This is one of the best CCGs, the best multiplayer CCG, and Richard Garfield's greatest creation. The game is a rich simulation of the original World of Darkness, and a very addictive and immersive gaming experience. The political element of the game is great, and the combat system is complex but entertaining. 

It suffers from the same problems as all CCGs, with bad rules being permanently out there on the cards, as well as being abusively expensive and giving some advantage to players with extra money to spend.

The best CCG I have ever played.  Deep and satisfying multi-faceted multiplayer card gaming at its best.
The only downside is that you need a few other players to make it shine, and that's not always easy to organize.

Its no MTG, but a solid CCG.  Strangely they came out with two editions that did not match, had separate backs. (Jihad and VtES)

This one hasn't really bit me (pun very much intended); it takes more time than I'm usually willing to give a CCG and I frankly haven't found it to be that entertaining. Probably more fun if you're a fan of World of Darkness.

I haven&#039;t played this one very much, but I did like the mechanics and the gameplay. As a CCG it would require lots of time and effort (deck building, trading and playing/testing) and of course money to get the most out of it.

Played the 3rd edition sabbat only version and was playing a starter themed deck in a 4 player game. It took almost 4 hours with explanation and I didn't really do anything until the last hour. Copious amounts of downtime between turns. My 4 rating means I will give it the benefit of the doubt, based on that last hour of play and give it another go in the future.

How goth art thou?  Designed by Richard Garfield of Magic and Robo Rally fame, this one has stood the test of time.  Great multiplayer action - and with preconstructed clan decks, the cost of entry of starting on this game is pretty low.

My favourite all time CCG haven't played it in years still have very fond memories though -  beats Magic hands down. Will be playing this again very soon. New decks are in the making as I type.

RATING: 10
Best CCG ever made in my opinion.  As MtG continues to strive for that all mighty dollar, it has pushed me and others out.  But V:TES has stayed true to its origins even with all the recent new expansions, (except for the Hunter expansion, we won't mention that here).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Lots of play time invested in this one. The game had a lot of depth and its inclusion of multiplayer aspects from the ground up made it particularly appealing to my group. Unfortunately, where some lousy CCGs have survived in my collection, my cards for this game are long gone :-(

Long. Like...4 hours. For a single game.  In the time it takes to play this once, you can play 4-8 games of Magic.  That aside, it's a lot of fun. It just requires a lot of forethought and planning.

Boy, did I buy a lot of cards for this game.  Why?  Was I really that stupid in college?  Thinking back on it, it is really not a good game.  I don't remember the multi-player aspect shining the way people said it did.  Just not a good game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Especially great with four or five people.  Then the mechanisms of directed actions and political actions became vital and fascinating.

Great art, great flavor, and solid gameplay, if perhaps a little too ambitious for its own good?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Really good CCG. Lots of negotiation and interaction between players. Combo or killer decks are not necessarily the best due to the "table atention" that they withdraw.The main strategy of a deck is usually built around common cards with a few rares as tricks.

However, has the common drawbacks of a collectible game like the need to stay up-to-date, which means high costs and continous checking of new releases
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
V:TES is so rich and varied an experience, the best multiplayer CCG by far and the best gaming experience of my life so far. Errata does hinder new players understanding of mechanics and card interaction but that is getting much better. Find a good playgroup and never look back.

RATING: 10
By far and away this is one of the best games I've ever played. A truly multiplayer CCG, this is in my opinion Richard Garfield's masterpiece that is very rarely mentioned. Such a shame!

The meta game that develops as you learn this game is remarkable, and the player interaction has both subtle and overt elements, and makes for a very entertaining session.

A truly great game, and one that all card game fans should try at least once.

RATING: 7
Probably one of the best of the CCG design ever put to paper.  The problem comes mostly with the players.  Finding intelligent non-goth wanna-be's to play with is difficult.  Those guys don't invest enough time in the political infrastructure needed to make the game worthwhile so you end up with a Vampy version of Magic, and if that's all you've got you might as well play a killer game of Magic.

RATING: 7
It has been many many moons since this hit my table, but when I played it I was a huge fan of this game.

Richard Garfield, not surprisingly, did a great job of infusing this game with thematic elements that make you feel like you are involved in the backstabbing world of Vampire politics.

Each Clan of vampires has very distinct capabilities and winning strategies, making for a facinating game where each side has the same goal but different paths to victory.

As a multi-player card game, this offering really stood out above almost anything else I had played.

Highly reccomended for CCG players who like to game with larger groups of players.

Vampire theme rocks. Artwork is perfect. Game is pretty long and it has a very slow tempo. I would start playing Vampire again if I find a gaminggroup that plays it.

This is the best CCG that I have played for player intereaction.  The idea of having to oust from the game the player to your left whilst at the same time the player on your right is trying to do the same to you can result in some interesting changing alliances in a game with several players.

I've now played this once with three Camarilla Edition starters. My friend playing the Malkavian wiped the floor with my Brujah and my other friend's Ventrue.

I'm a big VTM rpg fan and mainly started getting this as part collector. I couldnt get any of my Magic playing buddies to try it, so i had a RIFTS group intrested and we got to play it for a month. It's kinda fun but you need enough people to play and we just thought that the rules and play were a bit thick to get through. I never got any other cards after the Sabbot.

A five player circle jerk, yes, but a good one at that. Games can take forever, and often times you lose to no fault of your own, but due to conditions that were not your fault but ANOTHER players mistakes, but that kind of adds to the socilization aspect of this game.

Played a lot of times (with 2 to 6 players, mainly with 4 or 5 though). My favourite multi-player CCG, even though I had no particular interest in the theme beforehand, having not played any RPG in the WoD. Lots of deck-building options and an interesting gameplay, but my interest has waned a bit with too few playings compared to the rapid releases of numerous expansions.

The vampires and the different clans are cool. It's hard to build decks since I don't have that many cards. Also there is a mechanism with stealth that gets countered by intercept, but there is almost no intercept in the game. The best part is that you manage your blood, go hunting , bleed your prey and that your vampires can do all that stuff. But it's certainly not the best cardgame there is a little bit mediocre even.

RATING: 10
4/24/09 -- I love the deck-building component of CCGs.  Aside from RPGs and miniatures games, they're one of the few types of games that offer an extra-curricular activity outside of the game itself.  Deck-building in Vampire is very challenging; among other things, you essentially build two decks (Library and Crypt) that must act in harmony, and, with no cap on how many of any given card your deck can hold, you must factor quantity into your card choices.

But deck-building alone is not enough for me to be interested in a game, and the actual game-play is where many other CCGs have fallen flat for me.  Usually, for one reason or another, most of your plays in a CCG are fairly obvious.  The game-play in Vampire is not lacking, however.  The in-game choices one must make to play Vampire well are comparable to most any board game, with many layers of subtlety.  Diplomacy is also present in just the right amount (just enough to be interesting without being the focus of the game).

So, with Vampire, you get an intriguing game that you can tinker with after your friends have gone home.  There are very few other games that can offer you this level of immersion.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Ignore all the wafflings like 'for art fags, Malkavian decks are unbeatable, it's broken' etc.  This game has to be the most diverse, balanced and interesting CCG to date.  With SO many options it hurts, and there never being an 'unbeatable' deck type, it's great for new and old players alike.  The reasons it drops a point for me are - they changed the back of the cards (years back admittedly), there is LOADS of errata (you need an eidetic memory to keep up - or ploughing cash hand over fist to get the latest editions) and finally the new HORRID card layout...  Apart from that it is brilliant, utterly brilliant.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Probably the game that I have invested the most time and money in. I still own over forty thousand cards from various expansions, and have tens of constructed decks.

The local scene slowly died, and with my overloaded work schedule, I had to kind of give up on it (it has also apparently been shut down by White Wolf, so...).

I would still gladly get out my cards/decks and play if the opportunity arises...

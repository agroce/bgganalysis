Don't help you kids!  Let them tell you what to do in this one.   It's brilliant because it will teach them deduction through just playing it and losing a few times.

Great game for when your 5 year old wants to play, but you don't want to coach their turns.

RATING: 6.5
Kid's enjoy the gimmick to determine whether the clues are applicable to our thief. The dice rolling approach is fun and adds a bit of random luck to the game. I would say the game is easier than I expected for them. My kids are 7,6,4 and 2(although he doesn't play) and the 7 year old has no issue understanding the memory aspect and applying what "we know" to new suspects. They enjoy the game. With that said, the kids almost always beat the fox--I do wish it was a little more difficult to keep them interested longer term. We do modify the rules to make it harder, start with no suspect cards, fox moves 4 spaces per every roll prompting etc. Overall the game is enjoyable, but it's definitely more of a stretch / learning experience for the 4-6 year olds.

This is a great game for kids. I bought this on a Vasel recommendation who has many. It was an immediate hit with my 6 year old and he immediately asked for repeated plays over many nights. Its now a family game night staple (and he also like forbidden island & geister geister). Played this now also with friends of his who also have really enjoyed it. If your a parent, buy this game for your kids.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This combination "Clue" and "Guess Who" game is fun for kids. With an adult to help with the logic, you will probably win most games, so there are variants to move the fox 4 or 5 spaces every failure, instead of 3. The latest printing of the game does not include the confusing green/red options; only green shows when there is a match.

UPDATE: 13 plays in I upped the rating by a half star to 8.

Excellent kids' game.  Not something to play with an older crowd, but if you have young kids (4-8) to play with, this is definitely something to look into.  It's a cooperative deduction game of finding clues and suspects to catch a pie thief, and then deducing who the culprit is before he/she escapes.  Dice rolls are a key feature, as bad rolling results in the culprit moving closer to the fox hole, while good rolls help you find new clues and suspects.

Rating as a kid's game. Excellent cooperative deduction game for kids! Has Yahtzee-style dice rolling as well. My 4 year old grasped the various concepts pretty quickly and really enjoys this. The components are also quite good. My only gripe is some of the elements you need to look for on the suspect cards (like wearing a flower) can be tricky to spot and potentially easy for a small kid to miss. Highly recommend this one to parents who want to play a game with their 4-6yr olds that teaches multiple concepts.

Looking at this purely as a kids game, it fantastic. As well as the usual lessons from a co-op game (working together, turn taking) it teaches the basics of logical deduction. The game is also high flexible depending on who is playing. For example, you can have the clue tokens in a pile, and just choose one when you land on a  clue square (as the rules states), or you can place them on the board (either face up or face down). You can  also change how much the fox moves to give you less/more time. Love this one.

Best 3-5yo game we have played, bar none.  If anyone knows of a better, please let me know, because it would be an insta-buy.  For us this is head and shoulders above anything from Peaceable Kingdom (Count Your Chickens, Hoot Owl Hoot, Dinosaur Escape, Race to the Treasure) or any of the classics.  Amazing Labyrinth is excellent but we mod it down...not quite ready for the full spatial-visual experience.  Trying TTR FJ next.  We've owned Outfoxed for about a month and probably have 25 plays...we all keep asking for it :)

RATING: 8
A great cooperative deduction game for kids with a neat little clue finder to help you eliminate the suspects. Very simple rules that my 6 year old and even my almost 3 year old was getting it with some help. On your turn you roll 3 dice 3 times and try to get all of the same symbol (that you pick before you start rolling). These will either let you move to try and find a clue or uncover 2 more suspects. Based on the clues you can eliminate or confirm suspects and get down to 1 and you win. If you don't get your roll right, then the fox moves 3 spaces. That may be the one downside is there are so many spaces for the fox to move that it is almost too easy to get to all the suspects and enough clues to narrow it down. None of our three games were ever close to the fox getting towards the end. Otherwise this is a very fun cooperative game to play with my kids and definitely think it is one they will request again.

This is a great co-op game for kids. I'm not sure how you could possibly lose this game unless you make up some different rules (like moving the fox 5 or 6 spaces every time or insisting that you have to get matching paw prints on the dice). Kids like to win though, so that's ok. My kids love this game.

Keeping in mind this is a kids game:

Love playing with my 4yo, or even with my wife. The simple way of ramping up the difficulty makes that possible. Nice art work and components (which seem to be hallmarks of Gamewright) combine with solid mechanics, co-op play, and a gentle narrative for a nice family gaming experience. Def recommend.

[b]KIDS GAME:[/b]  This is a [b]great[/b] kids game.  15-20 minutes, geared toward younger kids (5-7) but big kids can dig it too.  Co-operative / deductive reasoning.  

Players are trying to deduce which fox stole the pie.  Roll the dice to either look for clues or suspects, but be careful, if you roll poorly 3 times in a row the fox gets that much closer to getting away!  It has the perfect amount of tension, and the kids seriously LOVE using the "evidence scanner" to check the clues.  Fun for the kids [i]and[/i] the adults.  

9.5 out of 10, kids rating.

What is basically "Guess Who?": The Cooperative Game is certainly more than the sum of its parts.  It probably doesn't have a long shelflife since its a bit too simple for my 8-year-old and yet too complicated for my 3-year-old.  I find it works very well for the 4-5 year set, which is sometimes a hard group to find *good* games for.

As a game for kids, or kids playing with adults, Outfoxed is relatively fun and interesting. I have some doubts about the durability of the Thief cards over time because they cannot be sleeved.

Have a few plays - great game!  Arya, at 4 years old, is able to interpret clues correctly, based on color, with no hesitation on whether it means the suspect is wearing or not wearing a scarf, gloves, hat, etc.  Really happy with this game!  Sits along side Enchanted Tower as the best games for Arya at 4 years old.

I bought this hoping it would appeal more to my 3 year old daughter.  She does play the game but gets bored after a few turns.  Revealing clues and suspects she likes a lot, but she has little patience for waiting for her turn to come around again.

Her turn is delayed by her older brothers, 6 year old twins, they really love solving the mystery and catching the pie thief.  They adore matching clues to suspects and always get excited when more are discovered.

10/10 Rating from our 8 Year Old.  His favorite game by far and the one that made him proudly declare that he loves boardgames!  Cannot recommend this game enough for families with children 6-9 or so or any family looking for a first deduction or cooperative game.  Our son was really interested in exploring other games of those two types after playing this one.  He likes this game so much we have played it 3 or 4 times in a row on occasion.  It only takes 15 minutes so even at 3 or 4 plays its an hour.  It doesn't manage to be annoying like many children's games are.  It has a nice gimmick with the clue contraption that doesn't feel gimmicky and really works in the way the game was designed.  A few people complain that the colors seem backwards but we didn't find it that way at all.  My only wish was that there were a more advanced set of cards or something to that effect as the only way to make the game harder as-is is to move the fox more spaces per turn.  The deduction in this one is pretty straightforward but still more advanced than a game like Whowassit! and considering how inexpensive this game is versus a game like that one I cannot imagine anyone not picking this one up.  I like the card art but do find the board itself a little bland in appearance.  It fits the art style but cannot help but think perhaps this is the reason its not in every Target across America.  It really should be I'd put it in the top 10 board games for kids. Ever.

In Outfoxed, you move around the board to gather clues, then use the special evidence scanner to rule out suspects. You have to work together quickly because the guilty fox is high-tailing it towards the exit! Will you halt the hungry hooligan before it flies the coop — or will you be outfoxed?

Outfoxed is a great family game for young children. The outwork is outstanding and the deduction part is really fun using the clue tokens and the cardholder to see if the thief wears the clue. Very nice design.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great deduction game your young kids (4-6 yr olds) and but for anyone older the deduction elements are too easy and then it is simply the luck of the dice roles that determines if you identify the guilty fox in time. The inclusion of a second harder "suspects" deck (one containing more overlaps in terms of items) to make the deduction of the guilty fox harder,   would provide more lasting appeal for kids and families who quickly get the base game down.

This is a great game for kids of the right age... 

Our 5-year-old twins loved it immediately, and they are still enjoying it now - months later. 

The clue system is what makes this game special.  It is a really neat way to teach the kids deduction skills.

Actually, the overall design of this game is so elegant... kids games have come so far since I was playing the Smurf game as a kid!

If you are on the fence, get this game!  It has an honored place on my list of games for which I have many specific memories of playing it with the kids and having a wonderful time together.

A deduction game? For familes? That's co-op? Well spank my bottom and call me charlie. 

Outfoxed is a clever little game that teaches children as young as 4 concepts like simple deduction and push your luck.

You are part of a team trying to determine which fox is the naughty burglar before they escape

Players must choose before they commit to rolling dice whether they will reveal move suspects or some clues. Revealing a suspect is as simple as turning over two suspect cards but for a clue you must move to a unrevealed clue, place in the plastic contraption of truth (into which you place the thief card at the start) and it cleverly tells you whether the thief is wearing that item or not!

Great for kids and families to play together but is too easy to play with out kids.

This is a game for children, but that isn't why I give this game such a low rating. The game is entirely too easy to win. Maybe that's the point, and maybe my experiences with it were really favorable, but even when moving the fox 6 spaces on each failed roll, he only moved 2 or 3 times the entire game.

My daughter LOVES this game. It is the first co-op game she has played and I think that that is why she likes it so much. The deduction is a little to simplistic for adults though, so that brings it down. Always happy to play the game though. Beautiful artwork, and simple ruleset.

A good solid deduction game for the younger crowd. Even my two year old can play this just fine with a little help. The biggest faults here are that gameplay gets a bit repetitive and it's much too easy (the fox is lucky to get halfway to escaping). But it's one I'm usually up to playing with the kids and that's better than most games in the 5-and-under demographic.

5 is a top rating for me for a children's game, as that rating says the game almost stands up with adults. This does a great job of taking a mediocre educational game in Guess Who and turning it into a fun co-op. It requires a bit of memory concentration to win now and it provides some cheer/groan factor with the dice. For adults, the game devolves into how lucky you get re rolling 3 of the same kind after 2 re-rolls. Each time you fail, the Fox aka Midnight Party's Hugo aka the loss condition moves along, but if you succeed you get information that helps you eliminate suspects. If you succeed faster than you fail, you win. Otherwise you can still win by taking a guess between those that are left once you're about to lose. There's no clever or interesting decisions, just the luck of the dice and some memory, but there is a "clever" mechanism which reveals information, like whether the suspect is wearing glasses or not. Anyway, if my kids were young again, this'd be a great pickup, but we've outgrown it.

A very cute game that introduces deduction to children. As you move around the board you gain clues as to who is the thief using a very well designed clue indicator. Then you eliminate the non guilty parties as you get clues until you come to one guilty fox. The children love the clue indicator and removing those who are innocent. Plus they play together which adds a sense of team play to it.

As my 4yo son gets upset with failing/close to losing in Chicken Cha Cha and Phara-oh-oh, I sought out a co-operative design to hopefully softlight his negative thinking and feeling (which may come from his competitive older brother) by sharing the losing/failure with me as well. Seeing and hearing lots of positive praise for Outfoxed and seeing it was for 5+ made it almost a no brainer.

However, I had to mentally convert the gameplay to his level of compre(hen)sion. 

Simplifying the language initially meant I used 'looking' or 'walking' for him to choose which symbols on the dice he wanted to come up on the 3 rolls. Sometimes he'll try to roll for a fourth time, and typical with the die rolling mechanism unless you are mentally or emotionally invested it the outcome, he disengages when it is not his turn to roll.

 Admittedly he wasn't ready for the concept of figuring out the thief or tactical decision making in speeding up the elimination process. Initially I empathised with Tom that the use of red and green dots were confusing, but now using the red for stop (on the table) and green for go (into the box) reduces the need to say who was or wasn't wearing what which makes for confusing conversation. I like the social and co-operative aspect as well as the mystery of who stole the pie, plus the drama of getting 3 of a kind; my son likes the sliding door gimmick, the fox, dice and places on the board.

I think this is a brilliant kids game. It's a co-operative mystery game, and you're trying to figure out which of 16 foxes stole a pie. You do that by either gathering clues or revealing suspects, with each clue revealing whether the thief does or does not have a certain article of clothing or accessory. After gathering enough evidence--i.e., you know they have a cape and a monocle, but do not have gloves, a cane, glasses, or a scarf--you can guess who the thief was. 

You learn these clues through a neat little plastic doodad that reveals localized information, and my son enjoys using this a lot; I'd imagine most kids would. 

It's a light logic puzzle, and it's also a good intro to the Yahtzee-style dice rolling thing that shows up in lots of other games.

RATING: 7
Brilliant for younger kids. All Thief cards are coloured wrongly in our opinion. We have since covered all options with red and green circular stickers and removed the blue circles. We felt that red would represent "no" and green represent "yes" as a more accurate alternative. It has worked well.
House ruled: The fox moves 4 or 5 spaces per turn but starts on the first square.

Based on play with a 6, 5, and 4 year old.

Definitely needed to "run" the game for the kids, but they loved it and got the basic concepts very quickly. A bit easy (we haven't lost in 5 plays) but that can be adjusted by moving the fox faster. It feels like it needs something else to be more tense, but the kids don't seem to think so. They wanted to keep playing after each play, and all the little details make it replayable. As far as kids games go, this one is a winner!

Outfoxed! is a great game for young children that promotes observational skills and deduction skills.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This is seriously the most fun kids game I've played with our kids in a long time. It's an incredibly clever game that teaches mad deduction and memory skills. We've played it many times with our kids, and it has yet to get old. The replay value is very high as each game is different. It's almost like a kids version of Clue. 

Outfoxed is a cooperative game where each player is a detective working together to catch the sneaky fox who stole a pie. There are 16 suspects placed around the board face down. Each turn, a player may choose to search for a clue (if she lands on a paw print) or reveal suspects. If revealing suspects, she turns over two of the 16 suspects which then exposes certain characteristics of that suspect. Searching for a clue is the fan favorite. You get to place a clue marker into the super cool decoder. It then tells you whether the thief is wearing that particular item like a monocle, an umbrella, a scarf, a bag, and more. If you have enough information to rule out any of the visible suspects, you get rid of them and are that much closer to figuring out who the real culprit is! 

The element of luck comes into play when you need to match all three dice to the declared action you plan to take. If you don't roll well, the fox gets closer to his escape hatch. If he escapes, everyone loses! 

This game is great at teaching kids memory and deduction. When we were first teaching our kids, whenever they would expose a new clue, we would say, "Is the thief wearing gloves?" (based on the decoder results), then, "Is Mary wearing gloves?" (based on an exposed suspect), followed up with, "Then can Mary be the thief?" They would answer each question with a yes or no which led them down a basic, three-step deduction sequence. Pretty quickly, we could just say, "Okay, what do you need to do?" And they would either leave the suspect or get rid of the suspect depending on the clue. 

There's a fun game we like to play at parties where each person draws the name of a different person in the room. You then have to remember each "new" name to strategically get three people on your team into the designated winner spots. It is really hard playing consecutive games because you have to wipe your short-term memory clean and start over each game because everyone's fake names are different. I found that to be the case on a much smaller scale with Outfoxed. For the first portion of a second or third game, our kids would often give clue answers from the previous game because that's what they had downloaded into their memory bank. However, while this presented a small challenge, challenges are how kids learn and develop, especially when it comes to memory. 

Overall, I give Outfoxed a very high 8.5 as a family game that is fun, that teaches skills, that is interactive and cooperative, and that has a very high replay value. 

As a very random side note, I like how Gamewright has you choose who goes first. Outfoxed says the person who last ate pie goes first. I've seen others that say the person who last played tag or whoever most recently used dental floss. Adults may see this as silly, but kids love it!

This is the first game I played with my 4-year-old daughter that she actually kept asking to play again over and over. She likes that it's cooperative and she's been into playing "detectives" lately, so she likes the theme. 

I enjoy playing it, as well, but it's obviously a kids game. We both like the artwork very much, and the components are high quality. 

Hopefully, she'll ask to play it some more.

My kids ask to play this every now and then.  When I asked my eight-year-old daughter why she liked playing, she said she liked having the choice to search for clues or reveal suspects. She also said she liked guessing who the theif is. She said she also likes it when we challenge ourselves by moving the fox four or five spaces each time. 

Personally, I find it boring for a kids game because there aren't any interesting choices to make. When playing with young kids, I much prefer Camel Up. Catan Jr and Party Sushi Go are also more interesting.

Clearly a game for children, Outfoxed has become my daughter's all-time favorite game.  This was evident when we found a copy sitting on the shelf at our favorite local watering hole, and my daughter's jubilation was observed by everyone there that evening...  :)

The foundation for Outfoxed is a dice-rolling luck game, where you basically get about 10 failed rolls until the game is lost.  This may not leave a lot of room for strategy, but the challenge to Outfox - for the kids at least - comes in deciphering the clues and determining which of your revealed suspects is "safe" and which is indeed the thief.

This was a gift to our five-year-old for her birthday, and she picked up the concept within 2 plays.  Now, with several playthroughs under her belt, she's telling her MOTHER who's safe the moment cards are revealed, even quicker than my wife is able to piece it together (which is hilarious in of itself.)

It's only a matter of time before my daughter will be whooping our butts in "The Alchemists," I'm sure...!

While the strategy is shallow, this still gets kids thinking, and that's exactly what I was looking for when I purchased Outfoxed.

Very simple and fun family game. This game does not try to disguise the fact that it is a children's game but don't let that fool you into thinking it can't be fun for adult gamers. There are ways to increase the difficulty such as increasing the fox figures movement or decreasing how many suspects you reveal with the suspect action. Overall fun family game/filler but this game is not a heavy game in the slightest. All components are really nice as well, it is a great looking game!

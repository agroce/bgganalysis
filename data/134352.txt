Well you will know your fellow partiers mighty well after this one. Diplomacy-esque, but good anyhow and one of few traitor games I actually enjoy. Ymmv based on who you're playing with. Quick, fast-paced, with tons of variants to keep it interesting. Recommended by Matt C.

RATING: 6
I like it for when I have more than 10 people (otherwise I'd probably just play ONUW) as there is some really interesting strategy that pops up in the room movements and conditions. In particular, this is much more about trust and information trading than it is about lying or bluffing and I find that to be an interesting game space to investigate with lots of people (which is why I find it most interesting at 16+ people). For example, sharing cards with just one person and then using what information you get to trade with other people (and using what you get from them to trade and most importantly/interestingly; verify or cut deals based upon) is really at the heart of the game and what it does well IMHO. 

The bummers are getting a good play space, enough time to adjust to the game each session, and sufficient people. Really needs to be done as a solid evening of 6 or 7 games back to back. In addition, I find a sizable minority of people are more interested in either a bolted on Werewolf behavior (of no sharing and deducing based on body language only) or pure information collection (where not sharing your entire card brands you as a useless heretic) which sort of hampers the game. A great convention game, and one I specifically seek out at cons, if you can just get people who are savvy about it instead of merely tourists...

AMAZING PARTY GAME!

Played this at a family gathering. Had about 15-25 people involved over the 5-10 games played. Such a blast. Each game gave something different as I would introduce new characters with each game.

This is definitely a family staple from now on.

Two Rooms and a Boom is a pretty decent social deduction game that improves on Mafia/Werewolf to make for a solid filler for 12-20 people. Social group games like these are usually very low on my list, but Two Rooms and a Boom fixes some of my key complaints with the older games of its type. 

In Two Rooms and a Boom, the Red team and Blue team are trying to figure out who is who. The Blue team has a president that must be protected, and the Red team has a bomber that is trying to get in the same room as the president. At the end of each timed round, occupants of each room will vote who to send over to the other room. In this way, the bomber will try to get next to the president and win the game for Red. Blue wins if the president ends the last round in a different room than the bomber. 

TRaaB fixes my key complaints about Mafia/Werewolf: first, "villagers/commoners" have something to do even if their role isn't particularly special. While Two Rooms has special powers just like Werewolf, even the villages in Two Rooms have the opportunity to vote on who to send to the other room. They're just as involved in figuring out who is red and who is blue as the 'special roles' are. Secondly, there's no way to die in Two Rooms, so you'll never be sitting on a couch wishing that everyone else would just finish up already. Finally, there's no narrator in Two Rooms, so you're not subjected to lame storytelling -- instead, the whole game is driven by a timer. 

I quite enjoyed 2 Rooms and a Boom. It's easy to print and play, and I've even made my own custom retheme based on the Russian Civil War. It'll stick in my collection as my one large-group deduction game. If you need a group party game, get this one (or check out [thing=176558][/thing]). Avoid Werewolf and Mafia, whatever you do.

First plays were at a senior game group (19) of my church, and most of the players had never played any boardgames. But the game was well received among the seniors, even though some of them had difficulties in walking through the rooms (but eventually they enjoyed to be the hostages!)

I think this is a convention game which I've yet to play at a convention but it's definitely one for a large crowed (16+ I would suggest). I'm just a little disappointed by it overall though because it doesn't feel like there's much to do other than try to figure out who the main players are and hide yourself if you are.

RATING: 7
1st plays: I see why this game lives up to the hype. It takes virtually no time to teach and play, it works with a huge range of player counts, and with all of the different roles there's an infinite replayability. It stands out against Avalon in the sense everyone gets a role, but I don't think it plays as well with 7/8 players.

2nd plays: As open and cool as this system is, I really think it would shine with 10 or more people, and 10 people is not a common player count for me. What happens in the rooms, with the co-revealing and everything isn't quite compelling enough to be a truly top tier game. I still enjoy it, but it's not my go-to game.

Print and play version by the publisher. This game has been a HUGE HIT. It is our go-to game for groups of 8+. We've played it with groups as large as 15.

Pros
- Short playing time
- Plays up to a lot of people and still fun
- Allows different ways to victory by telling the truth, lying, being private or public, etc.
- Very social game 
- Shouting and whispering and fake outs
- A LOT of roles so it'll be hard for the game to get boring with so many different variations
- Two rooms gimmick makes it very different 
- FUN! 
- You can balance the game however you like if you want more sharing, less sharing, more talking, less talking, etc. 
- FUN! 

Cons
- Need 11 ppl to have color sharing and make the game actually worth playing
- Requires people to follow the rules and be aware of all the roles in the game 
- Someone has to keep track of time in each room and be able to take charge when the timer runs out

Nice twist on the Werewolf hidden roles game, where 2 groups, devided randomly into 2 teams 'democratically' exchange members between themselves for a few rounds trying to gauge who is who in terms of roles. Depending on whether the President and the terrorist are on the same or different groups by the end of the game decides which group wins. The game until the last exchange is interesting, everyone trying to get who are the president and the terrorist. The thing is that once you have them and they are on different groups before the last switch, it all becomes a 50-50 percent of win/lose since once team does not know who the other team has picked for exchange.

The Werewolf killer cometh.

This game excels with large numbers of players. The first game I played had almost 25, for instance, and it was one of the most fun games I've ever played. The amount of backstabbery, politicking, and over-zealous yelling is great! These are the games I play tabletop games for (although I guess this is technically only a party game). 

I'll write a more detailed review once the official version is printed, but good God, this game is glorious!

RATING: 6.7
Watching people try to figure out what to even do in this game is great, and for a while i wondered if it would replace werewolf for me. I think that it is a bit too open and unstructured for my tastes. For it to form structure it almost requires intense groupthink, a sort of "build your own social contract" environment, which is super interesting... but I still find I wish there was more to do? I think for individuals this game can be more interesting than werewolf, but its drama is mostly wrapped up in one moment at the end, which I dislike. Plus the retail games scattered thematic elements are super meh, I would have preferred a straight cold war theme, honestly,

What a fun game!  First and only experience so far was at BGG.con 2015, playing a set of 30 player game.   Very interesting how all of the roles interact with one another, and some of the double-think that goes on.   I love social games such as this, and wish there were more.   

Probably will not purchase this, as I can't imagine ever having a group of the right size to play it.  I would think that the larger player counts would be much better games.

Rating is VERY tentative. So far, we've only had the opportunity to play this once - we played 3 games, two of which didn't include any special roles, which is not a very fun way to play and can easily lead, as we found, for the red team being able to lock down the president and bomber for the win.

Once we played with the special roles, however, we realized that is really the heart of the game. This game is almost just like a toolbox where you can make tons of your own little bluffing games by adding in whichever special roles you want. It's a super fun activity for a large group that will provide a ton of of laughter. Most games seem like they would just come down to the "are they bluffing or double bluffing?" guessing game at the end, so it doesn't feel as "gamey" as something like The Resistance, but it feels a little more substantial than Werewolf. Looking forward to my next opportunity to play!

It's just not that interesting. There's no real sense of tension or detective, it just comes down to 'show me your card'. I also get the feeling that all the different roles are 'rulesy' and force players to spend a lot of time getting the rules re-explained. By the time the third round hits, it's obvious who is going to win, or it's going to come down to a simple flip of the coin as to where the president and bomber are. There are better social deduction games out there.

This is the first time ever I haven’t rated a game even though I’ve played it! The reason is that it wasn’t a success, but it definitely was a result of us having never played the game before and the fact that we played 3 rounds with just 9 players… Most of us agreed that the game would probably have gone over much better if we had played with 20+, which we will try next year at the con. If we can manage that, we can also include some more roles which will definitely help the gameplay tremendously as you would then be able to show your role or just your loyalty (color) to a few other players. More deduction, bluff and meta-gaming would definitely have improved the game. The game itself is actually quite fast (10-20 minutes or ), and I definitely think it would be a huge success in the right crowd – then it could definitely get a rating of 7 or so, but the actual game I played was probably more like a 2 as it didn’t work with so relatively few players. Too bad. I look forward to play it with 20+! Unfortunately, it hasn't happened, and as my first experience kind of sucked, and it's almost impossible to get to the table, I've decided to rate it after all (but not as low as it should probably be, consdering the lack of excitement on my first playthrough).

Best with 10, 14, and 18.  Very good anywhere between 8-18.  Loses some of its luster at 6-7.

Fantastic hidden loyalties social deduction goodness.

Update: after playing this on the BGG PBF forums, I upped rating to 9. There are a ton of brilliant ideas here.

Update: Damnit, the more I play it the more I like it.  Upping to 9.5.  It really is great.  In a crazy sort of way.  It is very fun in the PBF format because it turns a light, quick, breezy game into a much more interesting analytic affair.  Surprisingly, with the right combination of roles, I think it works quite well in both formats.

Update: This game is so strong.  The codeword is "SOSTRONG". GeekMail this to JeffProbst61.

This is a form of "The Resistance with information". One of its core mechanics is that you can mutually share your role card. This adds a new level of information to analyze, rather than basing guesses on shots in the dark.

To prevent overanalysis, it also has a time limit so it's forced to play in 20 minutes or less. Further, no player elimination. These are all big benefits to me.

Start with only the very basic roles -- the game plays well even with those. Don't touch the intermediate or advanced roles until many games later.

I have been dying to play this game, ask any of my friends what I have been talking about non stop for the past month.  Finally got to play with 8 people on Easter.  We played for several hours and lost count of the number of games.  Everyone had a great time.

It's so great when everyone is laughing and someone is like "man it would be cook if a card did this" and bam I have a card that does that!

My only concern is that with repeated plays it may become less exiting as the novelty wears off.  But at this moment all I want to do it play again, and I have nothing but praise for this game.  I hope it doesn't because this game is fantastic.  I will be keeping my copy in my car at all times in the off chance I can get enough people to play.

This has easily become my favorite large group game. It thrives where other party/social deduction games fail for me. For one thing, I am a terrible moderator. Especially in larger groups with tons of roles and a specific wake-order (ala Werewolf). The game just ends up being more stress than it's worth. And quite often in my groups many of the players are new to the games so there is a lot explaining, a lot of downtime, and then a lot of bored players who have been eliminated. 

What I love about 2R1B:
*Fast game play--for me this enables me to try audacious strategies because if it doesn't work out I know I'm only 5 minutes away from another game and another role. Even if I'm not digging the current game, I don't have to wait long to get a reboot. This takes care of many problems including player elimination wait times, role assignment frustrations, and so on.
*Unique mechanics--I love having two separate rooms and how much that adds to the strategizing. The flexibility in how much you reveal also gives a lot of room for fun strategies. No moderator!! No elimination!! 
*Easy to learn--you can teach just about anyone to play 2R1B and I like to teach by playing when possible. This game is especially good for that.
*Quality--I just received my official copy of the game and the quality of the cards, box, and artwork is just awesome. 

Love, love, love this game!

There really is no gameplay in this. No deception. No lying. NOthing really to figure out as everyone just tells each other (or rather their friends) what they are. People really strut around thinking they are awesome for "being good" at this "game". Seriously superfans of this game may just be the most annoying people on the planet.

This works only when there are >10 or perhaps much more people, which is rare. And there's Werewolf which might be preferable. This doesn't justify owning a polished copy, could just do a simple PnP, which is also nice for customization.

Its hard to rate this using BGGs system.  I would never try to shoehorn this into a game night with 5 or 6, but if I was at a party with 10 or more people I would always want to play this.

RATING: 8
I can't help myself, I love social deduction games.

I think I stumbled onto this one via BGG.  It was also my first Tom Vassel video that I watched, oddly enough.  

The good:

Can work for large groups--10, 15, 20 people.  
It's fast (typically no longer than 11 minutes).
No one is "eliminated".
It's unique--unlike any game I've played.
Physically using two rooms is cool.
Sometimes variables move so fast I don't know what's the best strategy.
Cards a super sturdy--plastic.  
Non-gamers can have fun enough to play a few games.  

The bad:

Three games (tops) and you are done.

Some of the roles are lame--like throw them away because you will never use them. 

It's replayability with the same exact group is low.  Once you master a few concepts with the same people, it's harder to manipulate the game.  You must keep altering variables by adding and subtracting roles.  

You can often come up with the same question on the last trade, "Are they going to leave the president/bomber there or send him over here?"  Which really makes so much of the previous rounds kind of pointless.   To be fair, this isn't always the case.  
There are lots of time when misinformation or lopsided information spices it up.  

When the leader of each room ends up on the opposite team (which usually only takes about 1 round to happen), there is no need for them to "negotiate".  

Tips:

We've played with 5 rounds before, and it seems kind of pointless, even with a large group.  We typically only play three rounds no matter the size.

I wouldn't play with more than 20.

Lo más complicado de este juego es conseguir reuinir a un grupo de gente para jugarlo... Hasta que no hay 11 personas, el juego no empieza a tener gracia. De 6 a 10 se puede jugar, pero queda muy descafeinado todo porque hay reglas que no se aplican.

My biggest problem with this (and most light social/party/deduction type games) is there's always someone pushing to repeatedly play, eating into time that could be spent playing proper boardgames.

Can be a lot of fun if you have a large gathering. I wouldn't recommend playing with less than 12 people or the game can be sort of awkward. 

There's plenty of variety here with so many different roles but teaching the game can be difficult the bigger the group gets. Speaking of, it is very difficult to "police" this game as anyone in a group of 12 to 20 people can easily forget or mess up something and end up breaking a rule. Fortunately, it rarely ruins the game.

As far as I could tell, about 8 people out of 25 got to play something recognizable as a game. The rest of us were room meat. Even when my teammates knew I was on their team they didn’t need to involve me, and in fact could only risk their advantage by trusting me.  I understood their logic so, no hard feelings, I sat down and took out my phone. I also understood, beyond all doubt, that this is a uniquely shitty game.

RATING: 7
As with any 'social' party game, the mileage on this varies depending on who you are playing with.

We have played this a number of times, and it's always been fun.  Not the most consistent game around though, as some games actually feel like there is too much time in the rounds instead of it being a tense time limit.  We have played some a few of the special roles, but I can imagine it gets more interesting when everyone has a motive beyond just 'winning' for their team.

Edit 2018 : Droppig this a bit as, even more than other social games, you really need the right group. Some friends will actually avoid game nights if they think that this is even potentially on the menu. Makes people really uncomfortable if they don’t enjoy the experience of social deduction.

Idea
Each player gets a card that specifies a role in a two teams or a personal goal outside team.
Blue team tries to get "president" holder in a room without a bomb. Red team tries to get their "bomber" in a room with the president.
In few rounds exchange people between two rooms. Leader decides who will go.
Try to figure out whom to exchange by changing either color of your card or whole card.
You need to exchange right people to get your team member as a leader to control exchanges.
Also each team has special cards that can affect game to make it more special.

Partygame, needs alot of players to work well, like 10-15+. We had almost 30.

Just got my hands on this neat looking, large group deduction game. From what I've read and watched online, this game has potential for me! Can't wait to do a run-thru with a group of friends. The concept sounds awesome to me... physically splitting the group, hostages, voting for leaders, hidden roles, explosions, presidents, zombies, and sooooo much more. What could go wrong?!? Also picked up the Necroboomicon expansion to add 9 more characters designed for lower player counts as I typically don't exceed 7-8 players in our play group.

These cards should be the standard!!! Plastic cards all the way!!! I play poker regularly and using professional plastic playing cards has made me become somewhat of a playing card snob. If you've never played cards with KEM's, Modiano's, or Copag's I HIGHLY recommend them. Anyways... my point is, ALL board games (within reason) should think about utilizing PLASTIC playing cards especially if they are role cards or, will be touched and used on a regular basis. Just my two cents though :P

Tired of these werewolf-esque games were players go about guessing who is who on next to no information, layer this with a set of gamey effects and you get a room full of giddy dorks who enjoy having an excuse to be social and myself wondering why not just skip the Boom and have talk about something else over a beer.

About as dull and uninteresting as it could be and still have any hint of being enjoyable. The concept is novel, and I really rooted for this to be good. It ends up being clunky, with no great interaction or fun really. 

It does play quickly, kind of. The set up time often greatly exceeds the play time. I guess if you ever didn't have to teach new people the set-up time could be reduced.

Great social deduction game!  We really enjoy this one, it  always gets asked for at family gatherings.

Homemade version, plus the official published version.

See my review: https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1482647

Social deduction game with two teams, one has bomber, the other has president, and at end of each timed round a few players chosen by leader switch between two rooms; Red wins if their bomber is in the same room as the president; Blue wins if the president is in a different room at game end.

Best with 10,14,18, because then you have 5/7/9 in each room.

Very cool concept, but it was pretty awkward. Without a built-in incentive or forcing function to share cards people either didn't share and had too little information and awkwardly chatted in a room for minutes at a time or over-shared and everyone figured out everyone else's role very quickly.

This game could be substantially more fun with more people (uncertain) but in the 3v3 that we played, we ended up with each team by itself in a room in 4/5 games. This was a disaster - as 3 of those games came down to a pure coin flip of guessing who the other side would send over. Not ideal.

The only game I would take out if I have a party of +15 people, and for it's the only game who would get 20 people to play. Fun social party game if you have a large group. I would not play < 14 people. Buy the game if you don't care much about results. The gameplay is funny and fun. But on numerous occasions, it's hard to not end up with two rooms being completely blue and red dominated, and the result ended up being a 50/50 at the end. Need to play more to see if there's a good strategy to avoid this flip of a coin ending.

A simple game that can cater to an absurdly large group. The core of the game is solid and leaves a lot of room for the players to interact.

Yeah. So. 
The Resistance was a major sea-change in games of this ilk, where information enters the system so you can start making informed decisions. I feel like many recent games have started undoing this advance (the One Nights, Two Rooms). I end up feeling like I don't have any agency, and thus have no incentive to participate.

RATING: 2
Like many social deduction games, this one requires a group of very committed players to make the game work. If you have even one weak link, the game falls apart.

Updated: this isn't really a game. It's an activity. There is no real strategy. It's just an exercise. I'm not even sure if this counts as social deduction since social deduction belies an entity as a game--which Two Rooms and Boom is not.

And the best, this can be played with huge groups of nerds!

One of the only games you can play with 15+ people. We played it with 20 people, which is a really good number for this game. Many interactions can be hilarious, yet it is not always easy to get the combination of cards right, and the people who play need to be ready to get social and play a bit of theater and/or strategize together. The manual could focus more on how "difficult" certain roles are and how much experience you should have to include some of the cards.

I love these sorts of games for large groups and it seems like a fantastic alternative over a player-elimination game like Mafia or Werewolf.

I have had some difficulty with players wrapping their head around what the different dynamics really imply. While in many ways it is a simple party game, not everyone will get it.

Played a pnp version New Year's Eve with the recommended minimum of 11. Works well with President, Bomber, Doctor, Engineer, 2 Spys, 2 Shy Guys, 1 Gray, and 1 normal citizen of each faction. Had one somewhat dysfunctional team however that knew who the bomber was but couldn't figure out they should send them into the "blue room" in the last round. The "blue" controlled room overestimated the "red's" incompetence and sent the President to his demise scoring a victory for the reds. Lots of fun, but don't know how many times you can play this game. Waiting for original kickstarter cards which have taken forever. While the kickstarter inventors are charming ... the time lag for a few simple printed cards has become over the top.

This just really didn't work for me. It seems like some of the unique roles don't actually do anything, in particular I can't see how either of the instant win cards for blue or red should ever actually work out. It also seems like the whole game is in distinguishing the spies from the coy people. If the spies can't do their job than there's really no information to be gained about the opposing team and then the game should come down to a coinflip. Unless there's peeking going on, but then it's just another kind of bad game.

If you like hidden information deduction games, you should really give this a try, notwithstanding my lower than average rating.  The problem I had with it is that I could not remember the information I had gotten from people, especially when lots of special roles were in the game.  I played with groups that numbered from, I think, 15 to 21.  If I had a better memory, or if I played with smaller groups, I might like the game more.  I thought about taking notes, but didn't.

Gameplay: Great party game of hidden roles that facilitate great player interaction.

I admire the idea of the game, but admit that I probably haven't found/created the right group to play it yet. I can see that it would improve dramatically with repeat play and expert players. But you need a fairly large regular core group of players, which I simply don't have. But the idea is unique and it makes me want to develop expertise in the game.

Fun, fast, social deduction game. I've played lots of social deduction games but this one probably has the least amount of 'deduction' involved.  The games I have played have turned more into political/strategy type games in picking the leaders and placing the people while trying to figure out who to trust.  If you have 10-12 friends around I highly recommend this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
There's not much strategy involved. Often it basically comes down to a coinflip for each team when the have to decide at the end of the last round whether they want to send the bomber/president over to the other group or not. But it's fun nontheless.

My one online game of this was the virtual equivalent of being pressed up against a wall at a party while everyone else starts chatting away in a strange language. This was in large part the result of a combination of unfortunate circumstances, but even when trying to look past these things, the game doesn't really present itself as very interesting. Online I would just choose Werewolf every time. Playing face to face is likely much different but comes with its own set of practical complications.

A friend and I played my print and play copy with 10-15 strangers till 4 AM Friday night, then played an even better copy with 25-30 people including the actual game designers till 3:30 AM on Saturday... BGG Con, I love you.

Update: I have played my print and play copy with my local game group at least a dozen times since and it's always a big hit.  It has so many advantages over werewolf, no player elimination, guaranteed 15 minute game, no need for a moderator, or rather the moderator can play with everyone else.  This game is fantastic.

Second Update:  This is a great little game with a huge upside but the kickstarter is a disaster and the designers have lied to us (backers) repeatedly throughout the process.

Final update: The designers eventually made good on the kick starter, the versions the backers received is excellent quality.  The game remains fun and interesting, the final version is very appealing and brings more eyeballs to a game that gets better with more players.  Win-win.

[PNP] There is a lot of roles in this game and they make the game feel different each time you play. I just print the ones I like and play with them. The hostage change is really fun and sometimes really fun things happen like when you know that you will lose you can make a gray character lose by sending them over since they didn't help you or in one game the doctor and the president was sent every single time to different rooms and they could never meet. When they see each other on the hallway and facepalm it is quite funny. A fun little card game that really shines with 10+ players.

RATING: 10
I played it many times with huge group (around 14-20). This game is better than what I think it would be. Bought this on kickstarter with the expansion. It turn out to be my favorite 10+ players party game. These are the reasons why I like this game:
1. Simple concept: This game is easy learn and understand. New players might feel lost for the first round. They have no idea whats the goal of this game,but I guarantee they will get it after a few rounds. 
2. Suitable for everyone: It is really for everyone. It's better if you have a diverse group.  If you have someone who likes to lead, someone who is quiet or even someone who hates board game, this is the perfect. There certain roles in the game that need a good leader, or introverts. I played with my church youth group and they love it!
3. Fast and short playing time: This game is short. If someone who doesn't love board game, just ask them to participate one game. It won't take more than 15 minutes to play this game. 
4. Variety character: The characters are very diverse. You can put in simple characters for the first round and add in more characters as you play. I recommend introducing 2 characters for the next round. 

Overall, this is a game for everyone! You will be surprised how much my friends love this game. This is "Must Buy" if you are planning to play with a large amount of friends. I do recommend to buy some card sleeves to protect your card because this  game is not going to sit on your shelf!

Another social deduction/hidden role game. This one supports a near infinite number of players, and doesn't suffer from player elimination. Two opposing sides, one with the president and the other with the bomber. Bomber team wins if they're in the same room as the president. President team wins if the opposite is true. Additional role cards allow for other actions to take place during the course of the game, such as having the bomb maker meet with the bomber to arm the bomb before the end of the game. This fell a little flat for me, as I felt no real obligation to share any information to anyone and the game forces oversharing in some situations. Still, I love the style of game and would play it with a big group if I had the chance.

- I am playing the game with a group and I do not care whether or not that group wins or loses.
- I noticed that if I did nothing except move when required that I'd win half of the game. A game where I can do nothing and win is a game that lacks meaningful decisions.

It's an easy to learn, short, social deduction game that plays a large and wide range of number of people well, but it's just not my style of game. I guess I'm just a bit too antisocial to try to go around trying to figure out who everyone mostly by asking around, what they say there are vs. their tendency to lie and facial expressions when saying so, etc. and therefore, while I know there is more to it, to me I could tell just as much by doing a coin flip.

But it's not just nostalgia giving this a place in my top 50. It's an excellent game for groups that like social deduction game but have a significant percent of people that don't like to lie. Because you can go the entire game without ever lying, and it can be a valid strategy (unless you're the demon, of course).

While it's hard to keep track of everything (and only gets worse the more people there are playing), it's a lot of fun. I prefer it to something like Werewolf, since cheating (which is so easy in Werewolf and seems to usually end up happening) doesn't really kill the game. In fact, if someone "cheats," it's probably your own damn fault and you have nobody to blame but yourself.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I think this is an interesting attempt to add variety and information to the Werewolf style of game, but I am not sure it really works for me because it seems like there is too much information at times and the game quickly becomes the "poison cup" scenario from the princes bride where everyone has all of the information except for what the other players will do with that information...

There's a bit of spin-up time with a group of first-timers, but once spun up this is a brilliant, endlessly variable social game that, unlike EVERY other social game I've tried, makes me feel like I can contribute and have a chance at winning. Everyone was confused after the initial rules run-through, but one play with no powers (just key roles and "team" cards) cemented things, and the next two games went smoothly.

It's a hell of a tense 10 minutes. With 9 players, the 3-minute round felt luxuriously long compared to the compressed 2- and 1-minute rounds, but none of the rounds offered enough time to accomplish everything we wanted to do.

Needing two rooms and a decent-sized group is the thing that will prevent this from coming out as often as I'd like (heck, it prevented me from playing it for 3 years!), but I'll rejoice at every opportunity.

RATING: 3
Let me preface this by saying I like social deduction games.  Having said that, I dislike Two Rooms and a Boom.

Like so many other games in this genre, the game begins with players getting a role card.  Players are divided randomly into two teams - red and blue.  The teams are mixed with some of each going into one of two adjacent rooms.  Then the game starts in earnest.

Players start sharing (or not) information about themselves with each other.  This can be either which colour team they are on, or even showing each other their entire role card.  This is done over four rounds of decreasing duration.  At the end of each round some players are exchanged between the rooms.  The blue team has a president role, and the red team has a bomb role.  If the two are in the same room by the end of the fourth round the president is assassinated, and the red team wins.  If not, the president survives, and the blue team wins.

This sounds good in theory, but it falls flat in reality.  That's partly because there is a reluctance on behalf of players to share too much information.  Other problems arise out of the exchanging of players between rooms.  It's very possible that you get stuck in one room with little to do but wait out the game.  Another thing that tends to happen is that teams clump together.  So, you get most, or all, reds in one room, and most, or all, blues in the other with players doing nothing.  In this way the games is either too confusing, because there is too little information to go on, or just boring because there is nothing to do.

I found the whole experience to be lackluster.  There are lots of good social deduction games.  Play any of them instead.

RATING: 10
Best game of 2013.
How many alternatives for (10p+) Mafia/Werewolf do you know of? Yeah. Lower player counts have been nicely covered in recent years by masterpieces such as Resistance and recently One Night Werewolf, but there hasn't been real modernization for large player counts. Well - now (or soon) there is! No player elimination and 15min playtime (~20min if you count rule explanation and random delays) make it a winner. Two Rooms and a Boom will be a future classic once it actually comes out and makes it to shelves of gaming stores.

RATING: 7.4
PnP version.

PROS :
- Perfect ice breaker game to start the evening. 
- Perfect for larger events with 10+ players.
- Exciting endings that will create a huge reaction.
- The whole two room setup generates this great ''super secret plotting'' experience.
- Anyone can interact anytime with anyone in the same room, so there's no 2-3 people doing all the talk, like you'd see in Werewolf.

CONS :
- It takes a little time for people to catch up with the unusual setup and rules (voting the leader, showing only the card color).
- With the basic setup, frankly this doesnt work very well as a deduction game. After both rooms figure out who's where, the last hostage trade is basically a coin flip.

Even with some flaws, this game's a guaranteed fun and short experience with an exciting ending.

Kickstarted and later got to play this at GenCon. My experience of this game was one of the worst gaming experiences of my life. I will never play it again. At this point I'm tired of talking about what was so excruciating about the experience... I'm happy that other people enjoy this game but I'd rather play resistance or one night ultimate werewolf any day over this (I'd rather have bamboo shoved under my fingernails than play this game again)!

Decent social deduction game and cool in that it probably is best with more players rather than less. It can play up to 30! That being said, it's probably not my type of game. With so many people I just felt like a cog in the wheel. Many of the decisions I made had little or no consequence. The people with the power are often the ones with the loudest voice. That's never going to be me. In that sense it's like playing board meeting the game. Lastly it's very possible that the bomb goes off with many of the players having never figure out where it was (who had it).

Wheeling, dealing, deducting, and manipulating. If you have a group of 10 or more there is a lot to like about Two Rooms and a Boom. Played with two teams, in two separate rooms, you must figure out who is on your team, who is the president, who is the boomer. The you have to keep them separated, or get them in the same room, by the end of five rounds. There is a lot here in this little game. The level of scheming this game is capable or producing is intriguing. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
In my opinion this game is more similar to Space Alert than to Werewolf (and The Resistance etc.). In the latter games one is never sure about who is foe or friend and so one plays by and for himself during the game, even if having common objectives. Instead in this game when one is certain that a player is of the same team, one can work together, really working cooperatively towards the same objective (unless it is a spy, one has to be careful even in this game). This feeling of team work is very beautiful.

It is true that this is common with other cooperative games. But there are some important differences: in this game one has to discover the allies; besides the team is divided in two rooms and there are added difficulties in communication because of this; last but not least, there is time pressure, there is a timer going on, so there is no possibility for a stronger player to influence the team strategy, as in other cooperative games, simply because there is no time for it. This is what this games has in common with Space Alert. But here there is another important difference: the cooperating team is not working against the game, but against another team, people that react to your plan in intelligent ways.

The way one can form the set of cards to be used in each play allows huge variations: each set of cards is almost like building a new game (there are very nice strange characters, some of them having personal objectives and changing completely the way the game is played). I find this very nice.

My rating is still temporary, I have to play other times for a preciser rating  (not always easy, because the game is best with large numbers of players, difficult to organize). I have played in one evening with a group and it was wonderful. Then I played a second time with another group and it was a bit less nice: I think that the mood and abilities of the people playing can greatly influence the enjoyment one can have in the game, but I want to play more to give more precise opinions.

What I can surely say already now is: this is a very nice game!

I had high hopes that this would be a great group game, but I'm finding it terribly difficult to get to the table.  It's too short and unstructured for my regular gaming friends, and requires too many people to play regularly at home.  It would make a nice ice breaker at a party, but Codenames is a better fit and easier to explain.

RATING: 4
Played a 20er and a 14er. Not many games that you can say that about. It's a great icebreaker or ice-thawer, the latter because you end up having to work with people you may have otherwise studiously avoided all evening long since you're a catty bitch, but your drive to do well in the game overcomes even that. Both games ended in prisoner's dilemma scenarios, so from a strategy standpoint it doesn't add up to too much, but the fun is in the playing.

It seems like this descendant of the Werewolf/Resistance line should be more than it is. In theory I imagine people walking around cloak-and-dagger trying to discern information about everyone, but in practice it always just ends up as a coin-flip as everyone knows who everyone is long before the final round.

It really only gets play because it can handle a large group, and really Werewolf is superior even with player elimination.

Although this hidden roles game had a lot of hype building up to its release, after the massive delays and drama that followed in its wake, the game that finally released to the public is certainly enjoyable, but really offers nothing new for the genre.

Can't understand the low rating on this game from the community. This is the next evolution of social deduction games. Some of the roles work better than others but the core concepts are pretty darn good. After each game we discussed outcomes and potential future strategies. It really worked no matter your personality, shy or outgoing. Constantly wracking my brain on this game on what combo of cards could make it more interesting. What makes resistance interesting is that in between rounds there is some bit of information reveal to help provide clues. This game so often seems to devolve into party lines being formed and perfect knowledge of allies and imperfect knowledge of enemies, a controlled room scenario, where the last round is the tired poisoned wine scenario, a guessing game of which glass is poisoned, i.e. do we send the president away or double bluff and keep him here. Perhaps if between rounds there was some sort of information reveal as there is between resistance that could add a new wrinkle to the game. The roles are really neat, but some of their executions are awkward, such as the hot potato and zombie, how to make it not obvious that you have swapped cards? how to make it not obvious that you have been zombified to other players? I still enjoy this game immensely but i see its flaws and want to fix them.

There are very few rules, two teams are split it between two groups, you don't know who is in the room with you but you discuss and trade one hostage with the group in the other room. The blue team wants to keep the president alive while the red team needs the bomb player to end up in the same room as the president. There are some roles that can be added but basically a discussion game with few actual rules. It was not very fun and after two games we had enough, especially since we already played and did not like a similar game in the past.

A social deduction game that can be played up to 30 people.  A great convention game or game for a large gaming group.  The game group is evenly divided into 2 rooms after which time they look at the role card they have been given.  In the basic game, players are either on the red team or the blue team.  One character in the blue team is secretly the president while one character on the red team is the bomber. After a series or rounds, the blue team wins if they manage to keep the bomber away from the president.  The red team wins if after the rounds the bomber is in the same room as the president.  During rounds, individuals can discuss freely with one another, but after the round ends, each group must send one or more hostages to switch sides. With a large number of players roles can be added which add incredible variety to the game.  If you like social deduction games, this one is great.  What's more....the print and play version is FREE!

Played it twice, with 8 people. I had to explain it, while the other players were not all fluent in English, and I had never played the game before. I don't think I did a bad job, but still it was a confusing mess, and that was with just the basic game and 3 rounds. Most people had no idea what they were doing and I had to explain simple concepts like the victory conditions or co-revealing several times during the games. It didn't really work, although it did have people literally rolling on the floor laughing. But when the bomber opens by revealing their card to everyone in the room and the president doesn't even realize they are the president until the end of the game, it's not much of a game.

Hopefully next time I can explain it better, play with a larger group, and introduce some special characters. I have the feeling, though, that like werewolf it works better in theory than in practice. And like werewolf, you will mostly play it with mixed groups, while it would greatly benefit from a group where everyone plays at the same level of skill, initiative, desire to win, &c.

Played three games with varying roles, ten people.

I find that the fact that private conversations are allowed can make, and does make, smaller groups way less fun. At one point I was the only blue person in a room, and so the other four huddled around sharing information and laughing about their presumed win, while I sat there bored and alone. Pulling someone aside to whisper in their ear does not make an enjoyable party game. The numbers you need for a dynamic game (apparently 14+) is impossible to get, and there are at least dozens of unique roles, and this essentially indicates there are thousands of combinations, many of which are probably terrible, and only a few combinations that really accomplish what this game set out to do.

Add that all the art is grainy photographs, and the dozens of unique roles are... dumbtarded, and it does not make an appeasing game to play. Maybe if I had dozens of friends..

Probably the best game for 11 or more players, I still just don't enjoy large group games as many players just don't get to be that involved in what is going on. This can be fun if everyone in the group is enjoying it, but even one or two who aren't into it can sour the experience. While this is true for most games, with the very quick real time aspect of Two Rooms and a Boom I just find it takes a very specific group to really make it shine, and that can be hard to put together. Generally will just want to split into two groups to game rather than play this.

Sept 2017: Downgrade from 10 to 4. Gave this to a friend. My gamer friends don't want to play it, and it's too much of a hassle to play with my non-gamer friends. They find it a novelty to move back-and-forth, but then afterward they insist on playing something less active Codenames or Spyfall.

2016-07-04 Obsoletes Werewolf. I gave this a 10 as it dramatically reversed my attitude toward social deduction games. Fixes everything that breaks this game:
* No need of a non-player host
* No player elimination
* No silly eye closing phase
* Does not drag on and on

Surprisingly much simpler than most social deduction games!

Best part: it's so much easier to make threats as the consequences -- getting sent to the other room -- is not as awful as being eliminated from the game.

Note: Make sure you add some character cards; the basic game is either too bland or to difficult for players to deduce information.

This is a social deduction game that my large extended family absolutely loves!

RATING: 6
Do not let my rating of just above average subtract to considering this game. It is simple to play and gameplay is quick. Hell, you do not need the actual game to play. A deck of playing cards for each different Role will suffice.

A bluffing/social deduction game where each of two rooms has a "group" of initially mixed and unknown roles in it - good guys and bad guys.

Players will choose to reveal their role to select other players who then will carry the information to their own team, but the difficulty is that what happens is voted on which majority wins. So if you are a lone bad guy in a room full of good guys, you are at their mercy of decision making (vice versa too).

The flaw of this game is it more often than not dissolves into a 50/50 win/lose situation where it is honestly just luck. Not much can be done about those situations either.

Despite this, 2R&aB is a great game to pass the time.

A more politically incorrect version of Werewolves or Mafia. Delightfully twisted with the right crowd. Highly customizable. A little something for everyone! So many variations in how to setup each game and almost every one I've tried so far has been a blast.

Playing this too much with people who are not skilled at deduction games pretty much ruined this one for me. Plays went way too long after the game stopped being fun, and when everyone reveals who they are within five minutes of starting the game, it just becomes a measure in game theory. I would much rather play Resistance or another social deduction game.

We played a lot of this at Origins the first year they were there. Then the kids came in droves and just spoiled the experience. Too many roles used in one game spoils it as well. The core set with maybe one added power is the way to go. They just over saturated each gamer with way too much chaos. Deadened the experience for sure.

RATING: 4
there simply isn't enough information injected into the system up front.  The only information is what players mistakenly convey, plus some getting lucking on whom you exchange information with.  All too often, a majority of the players have no opportunity to really participate.  Some people still enjoy the chaos, but I found it to have an echoing lack if agency, choice, or interest.  You might as well deal the role cards into two random piles and see who wins.

In this regard it is too much like Mafia/Werewolf, and not enough like Resistance or Spyfall.

Pointless - this is more an social activity than a game.  It likes Resistance but with added mechanics based around revealing part or all of your identity and then arguing about why a player showed some or all.  I guess all conversation in one room is supposed to be open, but it's easy for pairs or small groups in one room to reveal information that other players don't hear or see, so the "game" falls apart.  I've become less and less a fan of The Resistance, so I'm biased against this type of game, but I can't see a Resistance fan ever preferring to play this game instead.  Just because a game can play up to 30 players doesn't mean you should play it.

Novel the first time but got old very quickly. Apparently it's a lot of fun if you get one of the many special roles but I've always been stuck with the bog standard powerless role, which is boring as hell. With that role, you can't contribute anything to your team because you have no powers and no leverage. If you're dealt that role you might as well slip out for a pint, because you're effectively out of the game immediately. Needless to say, getting that one every single time is appallingly tedious. 

Even if the other roles are fun (I don't know whether they are or not), having a role which is so useless and redundant, and yet can appear so frequently, is a major design flaw which should have been spotted long before release. 

Two Rooms is one of the very, very few games I actively try to avoid having to play.

Not bad for a large group game, but as with any of these it is very group dependent.  I feel like the first half of the game is trying to get a feel for people and then the second half just devolves into double think trying to send the right people to the right place.  Often our games just ended up with 1 major decision at the end (did we send the prese or not)?  That wasn't quite enough for my tastes.

There's an odd feeling about this game, I'll happily play it but the outcome always comes down to what seems a 50/50 choice about the final hostage exchange and whether the President and Bomber will be in the same room.

Alan and I designed this game specifically out of our love for other hidden role games - with our primary frustration being that as we are huge evangelists for those games in our gaming groups, we are often the one's who end up running them. We wanted to create a hidden roles game that the moderator could play. Not only that, but we realized that the more you played, the more likely you were to die early on in elimination games, so we also wanted to create a game that everyone would always get to play straight through to the end. And that's why we created "Candy Land."

It's a party game

It's already starting in the hole no balls and two strikes.

It's a decent enough game with the right crowd.  You gotta know the people playing.  It makes for a tough ice-breaker with a new group.  As a gamer, I'm generally on the extreme ends of the social spectrum.  I'm either really loud, or really quiet -- and with people I'm just meeting for the first time, it's usually on the quiet side.

Moderately interesting Werewolf/Avalon style game. It's pretty straightforward to play, but I'm not quite sure that there's enough deduction out there to really make it compelling. It's much more a 1-on-1 trust thing until you gavalanize a room, at which point it becomes a battle of wits. Nevertheless, it plays fast and I enjoy it more than Werewolf, although less than Avalon.

From the moment I stumbled upon this game while looking for party games on BGG I was hooked on the concept.
It's simple enough to understand and carries in spirit many ideas from other games such as Werewolf, Mafia or my personal fave, the Resistance. For me, the biggest factor was its replayability, no-elimination (certain role cards may allow this if you choose), its relatively short play-time and the sheer number of people (6-30, perhaps even more) that can be included in a single game!

If you absolutely hate games that are social and that require plenty of interaction, then this game is NOT for you.

The only problem I found was knowing how best to teach a completely new group how to play it. For non-gamers, this is a doozy. However, when there are experienced gamers, the concept always appears open to exploitation or imbalance to them and the at-first awkward mechanic of card-revealing doesn't make sense.

I'm glad to report though that in my groups this game has definitely taken off though it took maybe 2-3 basic 6-minute playthroughs with no special roles for people to understand the virtues of the card-revealing mechanic.

The most important thing I found was to emphasize that though it is a team-vs-team game, the card-revealing allows every individual to form their own strategy in order to gain the trust of, or identify other individuals in the game. These individual strategies can then come together in the grand scheme of things to shift the balance of power from room to room.

Perhaps the biggest challenge for this game is that it is very much a huge party game at its core and so players will struggle to get the game when its played with the minimum 6 players as it ends up being rather calculative and almost seemingly pre-determined; that is, less fun. If you find yourself, with a party of 10-30 people though, give this game a shot!

A great social deduction game for up to 30 players! The first game may be a little slow with just the main roles, while players don't really know who to talk to, but once you introduce more roles, it blossoms into a fantastic game. Really needs 10+ players to shine, so it's hard to get a play outside conventions.

Moderated two games this week of about 20 people. It was so much fun just watching, and 95% of people enjoyed it. Really a great opener for a casual board game group that gets everyone moving a little and talking. Basic game without advanced roles gets stale, but there's plenty of variety in the advanced it's a non issue.

Update: Got to play the next two and it was a blast! I got hot potatoed and switched teams after I got rid of it all while holding the leader card. I was able to work both sides and win.

Played a handful of times at UK games expo 2014. Seemed like there was more "social" to this than "game". The basic roles (bomber, pres, shy) didn't really give enough interaction to unlock the game and allow informed deduction, so the game just turned in to shouting dominated by alphas. Having said that, it was fun and I would probably play again given a chance and a smaller group (we played with 30).

Played a fairly simple introductory game and really enjoyed it. I'll need to play it more to really get to grips with the quality of the game but finding the requisite number of people is always hard. Anyway the game works and the atmosphere is great but I worry that for any individual player there can often be next to nothing that they can do to influence the game.  17p x1

Much improved with better role selection. There do seem to only be a few interesting roles on offer and the dilution that would occur with more than 20 would worry me. 
Still hard to get played. 12p x2

I don't usually like hidden role games like Werewolf or Resistance, but I'll give this one a relatively high rating because it can play fast even with a large group.  My biggest complaint is that at least half of the games I played devolved into a "Princess Bride" situation where on the last round the red team controlled one room with the bomber and the blue team controlled the other room with the president.  Then the blue team wins of neither team or both teams send the bomber/president, but the red team wins if only one team sends the bomber/president.  I also didn't like how you could get trapped in the minority of a room and be stuck there the whole game with nothing to do.  These complaints were based on games with around 10 people, so I'm hoping these issues decrease as you add more people.

This is a game for those people that have played Werewolf and similar party games where deduction is a major element. Because when you get to freely show your role cards to others, it's a really subversive moment that feels cathartic. For people that have never played those big group social games, this is not the introduction I'd give them as it doesn't exactly break the ice before shoving you into a group. Lots of confused looks and nervous glances as they try to figure out what the hell is actually going on.

I enjoyed playing it a few times, but it really is a game of shrugging your shoulders and randomly doing things. Too few roles, and the game is a little stale. Too many, and the game is just bonkers nutzo. Multiple winners, neutral parties, abilities that contradict one another.

I know a few people that would FUCKING LOVE this game. I also know a few people that would HATE it's guts. Me, I just sit somewhere in the middle, a game lover that soberly recognizes the cool social twist, but doesn't fully enjoy the execution.

Really, it came down to double guessing where the other room was going to send their bomber or president. So (at least with 10 players) it plays out like a quick social puzzle and then a quick "battle of wits" between the two rooms.

Kind of fun, but not the greatest thing in the world. The production value on this game is great.

Infinitely superior to Mafia, and better than most of its descendants, The Resistance included. While it's still ultimately based on reading social cues, the imperative to gain and maintain control of rooms, and having specific objectives beyond determining who's who, create at least the illusion of tactics and strategy. Plus it's interesting that everyone's in the paranoia business, not just the good guys.

My favorite "Big Group Game". It can hold well into double digits, and manages to do it well. I do recommend a moderator if you go above 30, but not mandatory.

Chaotic mess of an experience that I wanted to be over much sooner than the 15 minute play time.

Two Rooms and a Boom is a party game. And is a game that will play best with a lot of players.

The basic game is simple. Players are dealt out cards that are either blue or red. Randomly one red player gets a bomb card and one blue player gets a president card. Players are randomly put in one of two areas (rooms) and know nothing about any other player.

Leaders are elected by simple majority and anyone can call for a vote at anytime. Voting simply consists of pointing at who you want to be leader (or just not pointing at anyone). At the end of five minutes the leaders are called aside and they nominate five players to switch from their team to the other team. After another four minutes teams switch another four players, three minutes three more players, etc. At the end of the last round, if the president is in the same room as the bomb the red team wins and if not the blue team wins.

The game is all about trying to figure out who's who and who you can trust. Players can show their cards if they wish, show the card without revealing the role or just refuse to show.

The advance game introduces other roles. Like that the president has a heart condition and has to find and identify the doctor, or that the bomb is defective and has to find and identify the engineer. And then there are roles that are neither red or blue like the victim and survivor, one of whom wants to be on the team with the bomb and one who doesn't. And there are a ton of possible roles... like devils and angels who both are compelled to answer any questions but must either lie or tell the truth all the time.

I had a blast playing this game. It was a ton of fun. We played twice, once with the basic game and once with the advanced. In the second game I was the victim and wanted to die in a fiery explosion. I refused to show anyone my card, but convinced a blue angel I was on the blue team, which then convinced everyone I was blue... asked the blue devil which player wasn't the president... thus identifying him. Then I told the red team I was really red and established my credientials by ratting out who everyone on the blue team was. They already knew the blue president, so when I revealed his identity it was a pretty strong sign I wasn't blue. I then got myself transferred to the team with the bomb and even had him lobbying for me to be leader. But time ran out and they transferred the bomb away from me. So I didn't get to die as the ultimate victim. But it was a whirlwind of negotiation and manipulation which was hilarious.

The funniest bit was that they specifically revealed all the roles at the end of the game, showing me as the victim, but several red players greeted me the next day and still believed I was on their team and how sad it was that "our team" hadn't won.

I don't know that I'll get many chances to play this, but it was one of the funniest games I played all weekend. It's more of an experience than a game, but I loved it. It's also a great game to play at a convention. You get to meet and know a lot of people really quickly. After playing this I was constantly running into people I knew all over the convention.

Fantastic social deduction, hidden role game that gets people out of their seats. Some may have issue with the theme, but man does it add a lot of great tension. If you like werewolf, you'll love this, and it can be played by any larger group of people, gamers or not.

My new favorite party game. Everyone seems to enjoy it, and there are so many roles.

I don't like how some of the roles are dumb or useless. Hope they make an expansion.

Have played this twice at GenCon with a big group, and the hour just flies by.  So fun to allow alliances to form, and to see how people are singled out and not trusted.  Can't wait to play this with my students.

Playing this for two and a half hours straight at Origins was one of the highlights of the convention. This is the ultimate in social deduction games. The ability to show your card to others is what sets this game apart from others, and the game has an undeniable fun factor and addictive quality that makes this fantastic for large groups. I can definitely see a party being planned around this game.

Social deduction game. Certainly not my favorite of that genre. Thrives on chaos and I don't do chaotic games. Seems like a game I would like more if I had been drinking a beer. Not many components and it's easy to grasp. Good with more people.

I've only played this once, with people I didn't really know that well, so it's hard to judge it that well.  I couldn't read the people I played the game with well enough to be effective at anything, but I'm not certain that the mechanisms give you enough time to really work out who's who, and how to manipulate the votes to keep the right leaders in charge.  Given this number of people and the desire to play a game like this, though, I would probably play Werewolf instead.

RATING: 9.1
The everyman's bluffing game. You can customize this thing to be whatever you want - make it all about the weird roles if you're the guy who loves things like Tanner and PI in ONUW, or make it a straight Red vs Blue. There are even other objectives that no other bluffing game does, like trying to get certain specific people to cardshare with you. Or you can go totally off the rails and make it about turning everyone into zombies. Whatever.

The only downside is that you need at least 11 people for it to actually work. If you get that many, it will be one of the best game you'll ever play.

This is always a hit at our big event game nights. Sort of like a full session of werewolf, but with no down time for anyone as no one is eliminated until the final round. The basic set-up with just a President and a bomber is not all that interesting, but the addition of roles like doctor, engineer, President's daughter and the like really get things moving. I don't generally love party games, but I have to admit this one is pretty fun. I don't think I like it quite as much as Werewolf from a deduction standpoint, but if your group really has a problem with player elimination, try this one out.

UPDATE: This one is now in freefall. After playing it quite a few times, I've come to realize that there isn't much of a game here. There is a lot of running around to get information, which is fun...but that information is largely worthless, as the last turn player swap devolves into a coin flip, every time. Will they send the President? Should we send the bomber? Will they cross in the hall? This would be amazing if it was one of many potential outcomes, but it's not. The exact same moment and the exact same decision, happens every game.There are only two rooms, so there is always a 50/50 chance of winning or losing, regardless of what information your team has gathered. I've peeked behind the wizard's curtain and now I know all of the choices this game offers are mere illusions. Do yourself a favor, just flip a coin, call it and move onto something more productive.

I've only played this with 6, so many of the game's options for larger groups were closed off to us. At first it was just OK, when we were all trying to bluff or stay cagey. With so small a group, most lies get uncovered pretty quickly. But then we started using lots of grey roles, stopped trying to bluff, and started playing it as a negotiation game. We formed alliances, traded votes for favors, and stabbed each other in the back. Lots of fun. Looking forward to playing with more and trying out more of the special roles.

Secret Identity game played in two rooms; one team has a president, one team has a bomber.  Game revolves around trying to get them into the same room (red team) or different rooms (blue team).

So much variety, and the fact that the game has been free to print and play the entire card collection is amazing.  It is a very unique game compared to Werewolf and Resistance, although it does require you to have either 2 rooms or a room large enough that 2 groups can't interact with each other, such as a bar.

The premise of 2R1B seemed so interesting and I wanted so much to like it. I gave it many tries in a variety of settings (strangers at a con, with friends who are very experienced social deduction players, in my usual game group, etc.)

I have two main issues with it:
1) it's easy for a few very engaged players to take over the decisions in each room while others can basically just stand around bored
2) usually it's come down to the President in a room controlled by one team and the Bomber in the other room controlled by the other team, then a coin flip on who is sent over or not.

The special roles add some new loops and layers, but not nearly enough to save the essentially uninteresting gameplay.

Not sure that rating is entirely fair as we played too few rounds, they were too short, and there were next to no special role cards to give people some mechanics to work with for their bluffs... or lack thereof.  But I think I saw enough of the game to know that I won't like this as much as other social deduction games simply because half the information is in the other room.  Not something I'll necessarily avoid since I'd like to see a properly played session... but not something I'll be seeking out on purpose either.

Played two rounds with about 8 to 9 players.

This is a game with more people means more fun. Definitely a solid game.

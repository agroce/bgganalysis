1 play with 4. Dynamic area control game with several ability to develop for your tribe. Somewhat similar to Vinci or Small world, due to the abilities and the way combat is handled. However different enough to stay in the collection. Some luck comes from the card draws but they are hardly gamebreakers. In enjoyed it but thr first game went too long for my gaming group (3 hours). Compared to how meaty it is, the rules are not so complex and the iconography is rather clear.  

If you are in the mood of playing a game about ancient history in a reasonable time frame, pushing cubes on a map and developing abilities, do not go further.

This is very much a game you won't do well at the first two or three times you play, unless by chance against naive opposition. There are some basic design faults on display. A minor act of an adversary may have serious consequences, both good and bad, which points to a major random element rendering your own deliberations pointless. Zeus cards can also be profoundly good or bad.  Therefore I wouldn't bother planning your own turn prior to it. The lack of utility of the cavalry tile is a trap for the beginner. Its debatable whether or not the game lasts long enough, and this is a factor determining whether or not you can come back from those likely reverses. Winners and losers are a tad too predictable too early. Olympos seems smooth and elegant, but it is rough and crude.

Neat little game.  Doesn't feel entirely new, but it keeps the core structure very simple: expand or develop.  The "god" cards really keep you on your toes.

Minor gripe: there are a lot of different cards and tiles with pictograms to reference...with more plays, I'm sure it would be easier, but right now it's a pain.

1st Play:  I had hoped for more.  I really like the time-action mechanic that is employed in this game and in Thebes.  The idea that some things take longer than others, and you can string together actions strategically is very cool.  At the same time, there wasn't a lot of interesting events, and we had to refer to the rulebook a lot more than I expected.  It's very possible the game will be a lot better the second time, but based on the first impression, meh.

2nd play: No second play.  The game really didn't feel very civ-sim like, and the choices were interesting but without any real tie in between in-game mechanic and advancement of the civ.  Techs had no name and were simply "Sword" or "2 Swords", and Wonders didn't even have that much.  Part of the appeal to civ games is that the moving pieces be interesting and have a character to each of them.  This didn't have that and it sealed the deal.

RATING: 7
A surprising number of interesting aspects are fit into this roughly 90 minute experience. The game plays fast and tense while accomplishing a lot. I especially like exploring how the different techs work together, which are distributed randomly in different permutations by row every game making the tech columns offer very different cost-benefit scenarios.

I've kept a consistent record of not winning this game while still having fun with it. It's funny how you can feel like you're succeeding at your goals while not actually winning because others beat you out by succeeding in their niche just a little bit more. It is very tightly balanced, which is a plus.

However, I feel like the combat holds me back from giving this game a higher score. I always want to build up my budding civ on the map long-term, but that's just not what kind of game this is. The map is really more of a giant wrestling match in order to control the right resource combinations to pay for tech advances at the right moments. You're constantly shoving each other around the board, gaining and losing resources.

Finally, I really wish there was more variance with the "Zeus" cards that can randomly screw "un-pious" players from time to time. They add an interesting element to the game, but they have a larger impact than I think they should. I would prefer it if there were some more cards that made the games more unique and the effects less consistently strong/predictable.

I cannot imagine why I would ever want to play small world (or most any other civ game) again after playing this. Yeah, it's very distinct from SW but you can tell it was made by the same designer, and hits many of the same area control buttons. The civ game is completely pared down with nothing extraneous, includes combat but makes it so the loser doesn't feel incredibly punished while still being useful for the aggressor, and has the great feeling of not quite being able to do everything you want to do. Very great little game

As in Philippe Keyaerts' earlier designs Evo and Vinci/Small World, there is conflict in Olympos.  However, it is not the focus of the game, being highly abstracted and infrequent - and nobody dies.  At heart, Olympos is a civ game and grabbing land is mostly a means of gaining resources to develop your people.

A great variety of discoveries offer a wide range of benefits, but it seems clear that two are more important than others; swords (military power) and Zeus tokens.  Without swords, be prepared to be a migratory people.  Without Zeus tokens, be prepared for punishment beatings from the chief deity. A randomised set-up adds much needed variation in the costs, one-off benefits and alignment of the discoveries.  Turn order determined by time spent is becoming a familiar mechanic, but it again works well here.

Olympos moves along at a decent pace, despite some fiddliness around constantly adjusting your resource chits.  It offers some not too difficult decisions and delivers a fair bit of interaction.   Quite enjoyable. 

Some of the iconography, particularly on the Zeus and bonus cards is opaque.  Be prepared for frequent references to the card descriptions in the rules.  The artwork on the developments and Zeus cards is nicely done.  Production quality is mostly up to Ystari's usual standards, although the flimsy card to place the discoveries and wonders on was a disappointment.

RATING: 6.5
Fairly straightforward game of settling, conquering, and developing civilisations. Nice theme and turn order mechanisms. Not sure I like the back and forth possible in the automatic victory to the aggressor given in every combat. In my first game the feel of it changed dramatically as we approached the end-- lots of AP, lots more aggression, harder to plan. Would certainly play again and be interested how a different play turned out, but didn't strike me as exceptional.

I loved this game the first time it hit the table, but my feelings have diminished with repeated plays.  It does give the same feeling as Keyartes' Smallword masterpiece but with technologies instead of racial powers.  I think the downfall of this game is a lack of replayability, especially when you compare it directly to Smallworld.  Still in my collection for the time being because its just such a beautiful looking game, and I'm a sucker for anything set in ancient Greece.

Lots going on here, and I do love the art which is beautiful.  This game feels like an exercise in throwing in as many standard euro mechanics in the hopes of selling games. This is cookbook game designing.  It works well enough, but it doesn't feel fresh, interesting, original or worth playing much, at least after one play.  Thematically, it feels very derivative.  It is an admirably short game.

Really, really want to play this more.  I enjoy the simplicity of play and the 'clock' that everyone works around as a very excellent base mechanic.  Discoveries and the randomization of their sequence is also a very interesting way to keep the game changing.

I'm curious if there may indeed be emergent strategies, but so far, the game seems just as fun with 3 and 4 players (I wonder if 5 is too crowded?) and the games have been close.  As much as you think you might be out, the end-game scoring seems to do an excellent job of rewarding your strategy.

First Play: I'd absorbed the rules and played with three other newbies. Although the rules are straightforward they take some explaining and the player aids here on BGG are essential to enable players to see what the discover tiles can do.

WE put the map board in the center and discovery board to one side. In hindsight I think it should be the other way around, there is more detail to absorb with the discovery costs than anything on the map.

Once explained the game flowed very nicely with only a few halts to check rules (mainly the god cards).

Finally we all finished within 5 points of each other, very tight despite some very different strategies. I look forward to playing this again.

Second Game: Yes this is a grower. The need to be aware of opponants actions is paramount. One to keep in the collection.

A reasonably well balanced "collect the resources and build the buildings" type game with a Thebes type time track measuring off your actions.

I can hardly believe Olympos was made by the same author of Small World: indeed, while Small World is so much fun and social, I found Olympos to be just another long, boring, fiddly, soulless and unoriginal eurogame looting from a moltitude of other successful games (besides the obvious Small World, Cyclades and Seven Wonders come to my mind) with poor results.

The theme, set in the classic Greece, blindly follows these last years’ trend - which has been re-discovering (and, sadly, re-inventing) the Graeco-Roman pantheon and mythology - but adds nothing to the game: you immediately feel the theme was simply stuck to the mechanics, for it could be about everything else and work just the same. Moreover, none of the cards and tiles feel thematic: rather, most of the drawings look like they are random free-to-use cliparts taken from the Internet and roughly assigned to this or that «tech» just by resemblance.

What really kills the game though is the endless gaps between turns: whenever you manage to make a good move and buy something worthy then you find yourself waiting ages for your next turn to come, with the only result of making you even less involved in such a boring game.
The real challenge while playing Olympos is to keep awake until the end.

The theme is kinda detached from the gameplay, but I really dig this game. Attacking doesn't really hurt anyone, which saves this game from being a simple Risk-ish free-for-all.

RATING: 5
Olympos is a fairly unimaginative civ game that fails the few times it tries something unique.  The barebones game of moving and creating settlers and the tech track are fairly mundane and obvious.  To obviate the player-bashing endemic of the genre you do not lose pieces when attacked and in fact get some extra time.  But attacks always succeed so much of the game is about manipulating time such that you can take the necessary resources and a discovery without anyone interrupting you.

Couple this with a tech track that rewards you for discovering the same column and it's a recipe for disaster.  There is no way you can align your tech needs and stay mostly in the same column, especially considering how long it takes to discover.  The idea of balancing pressing needs with later wonders might work in a different game, here it is but frustrating.

Finally the designer added some cards.  Destiny cards are alright, though a little swingy because they can be worth 1 vp or up to 4 with the appropriate board position.  However, the Zeus mechanic is punitive and arbitrary.  The granularity of Zeus symbols is large and the opportunity cost for getting them nontrivial.  Furthermore, their effects are range from doing nothing important to wiping out a player's entire hand of Destiny cards.

As you can tell the game is very chaotic with little room for long range planning or building up board positions.  Despite that it is fairly calculational as you tally up your time every turn and try to figure out how to get multiple turns in a row.  Overall, a dud.

Also I should note the terrible iconography.  The tech symbols are basically useless (wtf does an equal symbol bring to mind), the destiny cards are similarly unhelpful and finally the Zeus cards have no text and look quite similar so you end up paging through the rules for them every time.  Really appalling stuff just to be language neutral, but ends up more like awful in any language.  Oh yeah and the map is ugly and the resource symbols are too hard to parse on the board.

2011. A set collection and territory control game in which timing really matters and that's a bad thing because you only get one action per turn (e.g., claim a technology tile, conquer a region, etc.).  The net result is annoying pissing contests where an opponent takes one of your regions leaving you without the necessary resources to claim a tech tile so you have to spend a turn getting it back or conquering another one and hoping that nobody steals from you before your next turn; the problem is that with only one action per round you cannot take something and use it on the same turn.  This tug of war just isn't fun.  Particularly because in the meantime, another opponent not involved in the pissing contest can gain ground.  This is amplified by the fact that everyone starts at the top of the map and moves downward, creating immediate tension/strife from stepping on each others toes while marching a turn at a time toward less contested areas at the bottom of the map.

I'm a big fan of the Thebes time mechanism, but I'm not sure I like it used for a combat system like it is here.  While some players may be more efficient at war, any player can always defeat another and take a key resource that was needed for an advancement on the next turn.  This can be very frustrating if it happens a couple of turns in a row.

The german translated rules are a mess. No one can play this game right in the 1st match. It wasn´t mentioned there, that every player gets an action card, which reach the Zeus sign. We had to work the rule book sentence by sentence and the icons on the cards are not real logical and often it leaves the questioner with undefined words. I wish there comes a player aid within and the english rules wasn´t included like some other publishers often had done. There are 10 games published before, where the iconography of the Action cards is better solved. 
The game itself is ok, i liked it and compare it with a kind of Vinci is mixed with Puerto Rico (without role selection)and Prince of Thebes. Together with the rare Oukoimene Expansion, which adds a bit tiles and flavors to the greece peninsula.

Two plays, I rather liked this one. It's still an Ystari game, so it's a bit of an over-chromed monstrosity with too much public information leading to potentially serious analysis paralysis issues and not-great theming, and yet, for all that, for still being recognizably Ystari, it's as good a game as I've ever played from them. Nice tension in the choices of tech, a nice flow with the Thebes-like time track, and the game tension is well-meted-out with too much to do in not enough time. A simple and obvious "trick" to making your game work is to make sure the game ends with plenty of opportunities still on the table, something that too many designs haven't grasped but which Olympos basically gets.  The analysis paralysis may end up killing it before to long, but in the mean time I'm enjoying it.

Not in the same league as Small World, though, if only because the colorful races in Small World allow for a great deal more personalization and engagement, while Olympos' flavor is less immediate.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A pretty cool simplified civ game.  You can definitely see the parallels between this and Vinci/Small World, in that each players civ is going to have different abilities as you move through the game.  However, here you decide how you want your civ to develop rather than deciding from pre-built civs.

Boiled down to its basics, in Olympos, you're taking over countries on the board in order to use their resources to buy various advancements for your civ.  These advancements might make increasing your population cheaper, help you travel more quickly, allow you to conquer more territories more efficiently, curry the favor of the gods, score you points, etc.

One drawback of the game is that while they did some small things to keep the game variable from game to game, it felt very samey after just 2 games.  It looks like the expansion will fix this, but I really wish more variability had been packaged in the base game.

When it's all over with, you total up your points based on various aspects of your civ, and see who made the most glorious civ!  Overall, a pretty cool and simple civ game that I dig.

A good game, for the moment I stand by my review with just some additional plays. I would not play this with 2p anymore though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I probably like the idea of Olympos more than the game itself. It is a short civ-game with very simple rules; you basically move a guy on the board, thereby securing an area with a resource, or you use some of those resources you have claimed to develop technologies which grant you various abilities. It plays in about an hour, and military isn’t a ”OP strategy” as it is in other civ games… Because basically the attacker always win and conquers the area; the cost of doing so just varies depending on the number of military symbols you own. Still, in my second game we realized that it can be very difficult to come back and win if you get attacked and lose a lot of areas… Because then you will have very few resources left and it will take a couple of rounds to recover, so in that sense I’m afraid I don’t like the way military is handled in this game.

However, there are also a couple of good things to be said about this game. First of all I like the various strategies which stem from the differente techs. For instance you can buy a tech which lets you move cheaper across sea, which means that you’re likely to pursue a strategy where you’re heading for Atlantis to get star tokens and maybe build some wonders. A lot of swords means that you’re likely to attack the other players a lot and benefit by them losing the resources. Or you might get a lot of Zeus symbols in order to take advantage of the Zeus cards. There are also techs that give you bonus points for e.g. the number of swords, the number of tokens, the number of tech tiles etc, so there are many paths to victory! The setup of the tech tiles is random each time, which is genius as there is no “best” pattern to pursue!

Another cool feature is the way the turns are resolved; you don’t just take an action in a clockwise direction, no, you take an action, and that action costs a number of action points. You move your marker that many spaces ahead, and then the last player is always the one to take the next action! This means that you can take a huge turn or develop a tech etc., but that means that it won’t be your turn for a while as the other players might take some less expensive actions. The timing of this is critical due to the Olympos/Zeus cards, which was something I enjoyed quite a bit! My rating is good right now but will probably drop in the future as I just don't see the staying power.

Uses the 'time spent' mechanic from Thebes and Tinner's Trail and set collection and 'technologies' from any number of games; so nothing particularly original. Players that get involved in feuds over territory stand no chance of winning. The game simply isn't long enough for that. Every action has to count which means that to play well players need to spend ages studying all their options and then studying again after someone mucks up their plans. No, thanks.

Good game with a nice time track mechanic that really adds a good balance to the choices that are made. A very cool tech tree to grow your powers, and the powers all seem really cool. The downsides that could effect gameplay are king making and AP. However, the game does not take long to play, so it's much easier to get out and play.

Rated 8 after one play. A civ-lite game in about an hour and a half? Not sure if people will consider this a true civ-lite game, but there's a lot that I enjoyed about this. It's area control, resource management, and a tech tree in a pretty nifty package. And, I at least found the technologies fairly thematic. Combat, however, is very abstract. Instead of the casualties of war, what you really end up doing is pulling resources away from other players, which limits their tech ability.

In a three player game, there are some "sharp elbows" as players vie for different resources. Holy smokes, I gotta imagine a five player game is rough. Four might be the "sweet spot" with this one. It's quick, it presents plenty of decisions, and buying technologies is fun!

There's a lot of mechanical integration cleverness in this ultra-euro-ish I-Am-A-Eurogame eurogame from Europe. I'm the wrong audience--jaded, crabby, testicular, I'm not enthusiastic about cyborg erotica "victory point engine" competitive game puzzles in general. I don't enjoy counting and recounting icons and examining (and reexamining) a factory shopping menu. When it's my turn, I've preplanned my simple machine and I take less than 30 seconds to choose, my opponents (who like the game) take 10+ minutes. However, I might sourly be willing to play to return the favor of folks who play the games I suggest, and see the careful and  building their intricate lace of VP-building logic calculas. elaborate intent of the design. Plenty of people love it, so that shows something good.

Interesting light war game. I'm not sure I like the mechanic where the defender always looses, but then again, it is similar to what we experienced on Small World to a degree. The discoveries are interesting, and the Thebes-like time mechanic is always neat to see, but nothing super great here. Also, the theme is absolutely pasted on. Zero flavor.

I've only played once, but I felt rushed. Not that the other players were impatient, but it's one of those games where there's a HUGE array of choices of stuff you can acquire. And they all have different costs and benefits. I'm finding that I'm not a huge fan of such games. I like, for example, the change in Rise of Empires from Struggle of Empires to make only a reasonably small number of items available to acquire each round, rather than the full assortment. I also was slightly disappointed with the relative minor significance of the map itself. And finally I don't like how the last player chooses which regions are not in play. I dont like one player making that decision in isolation, nor do I think it's an adequate consolation for going last.

RATING: 7
Looks interesting. First reports appear to hint at a game which is to Vinci as Tikal II is to Tikal, but then in the parallel universe where Tikal II would have worthwhile gameplay. But we'll have to wait for the rules to appear, for I'm worried that the announced 'replayability' is in fact window dressing for 'shuffle a deck of cards around'.

[b]After first play[/b]    It's always interesting to compare pre-game opinions to after-game impressions. In this case I'm happy to report that the above paragraph is not far from the truth. The concepts of expansion and territorial occupation, plus the very look of the map indeed remind a gamer of Vinci. But the very speed of the game, including the tactical manoeuvring and the concept of wonders and discoveries, is new. It's fun to see how after a while players begin to economise their time because they don't really want the game to end. And sometimes they may even want to abandon territories because their resources simply aren't up to it. 

That all said, a few negative comments. I dislike the form the condemnation of territories has been given. It's hard to see the small crosses on the small tokens, and they blend in with the background far too well. The game should have come supplied with a number of wooden X's which pop off of the board immediately. Point 2 is the lack of player aids, although I concede they aren't really necessary after a while. The final point is that I'm not convinced about replayability. Of course the game is very variable, but how this changes important tactics is something I'm not entirely convinced of at this moment. That said, the game is quick enough that it's probably not that much of an issue considering the time the game will spend in my collection.

[b]Update[/b] The game already improved noticably after I purchased some wooden bits to clearly mark condemned territories. Far harder to 'fix' were the general ideas on how to play the game. If you play Olympos as a quiet civilisation builder, the game breaks down frightfully easy. Players create little pockets of influence, get their hands on wonders and discoveries far too easily, and just walk away with victory. The only way to play the game is to be agressive from moment one: if you see someone collect a few resources too easily, hit on him. Double resources, even more so. Cavalry? Get cavalry yourself (if available) and stomp him again. Loss of a resource chit (while you gain it) is worth the conflict; and really, [i]do[/i] grab those swords. Don't try to grab all sorts of cool stuff before someone else can: if you are too far ahead of the pack, it will take too long before it becomes your turn again. Keep up with the others until the game is half to two-thirds done. In any case, when played like this the game's balance reasserts itself, and that is a Good Thing. 

Unfortunately, since this is the only way to play the game, the game's variation comes in from condemnation of areas, and the arrangement of the discovery tiles. While it shifts the focus every time, I'm not convinced the overall feel changes from game to game, as there is no way not to play this game peacefully. I think that the Oikoumène expansion will aid greatly in staving off boredom because it introduces more variability in the 'tech tree'. To date I haven't played with Oikoumène yet, and it wasn't until my play count was inching towards 10 that I finally understood the basics... but I think that expansion is one of the few which is actually worth their money.

The downside is that not playing Olympos according to the invisible rule book causes discomfort and disappointment. This is not a game for casual gamers. This is both a curse and a blessing. I count myself lucky that the proper way of play is easy to explain, and is easily seen to work, otherwise the outlook would have been a lot more grim. (Indeed it has been, for a while.) For now, a decent game of quick combat and point grabbing.

Fun euro-like civilisation building game which requires a little thought about how best to spend your limited amount of time to score as high as possible. Plays just as well with 5 as it does with 2 (official variant). Thought it might be a little hard for new players on the first game but so far no problems! Gone down well with my wife.

While not a bad game, Olympos is a thoroughly unexciting game.  The mechanism lifted directly from Jenseits von Thieben is easily the best part of the game.  The swing of luck from the event cards is huge - too huge - while the differences in time given by taken sword tech is pretty small.

Players are ancient tribes, invading Greece from Europe, expanding and developing their tribe.  A straightforward civilization expansion game where players spend Thebes-like time on a track to either move on the map, or develop a technology.  The player furthest back "in time" takes the next turn. Expansion and conquering is simple, and earns the resource token from the location.  Resources allow you to acquire technologies, which grant in game powers as well as credits towards high scoring wonders.  God cards assist the pious, and bonus cards grant powers and points.  When every player has used their time up, point are totaled and highest wins.  Smooth playing game, really enjoyed it.  You really need to have two or three plans in place to snag a wonder, as it appears difficult to win without one.  Liked this one, despite the various graphical disasters on the board and counters. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Olympos doesn't impress. It just dresses up a very dry free-for-all territory-fighting in a few fancy mechanisms.

Olympos uses the time mechanism from Thebes and an arbitrary menu of technologies. So as the game progresses  players customize their empires. 

It has a few cards-in-hand, so there is a tiny amount of hidden info, but it's predominantly all public information. So, like all these games it is very prone to overcalculation, and therefore analysis paralysis.

Fabulous game where your turns take a certain amount of 'time' depending on what you do.  The more you do the more 'time' you will use up and the nearer he game end it becomes.

It's been too long since I've played this one to give a good critique on it. All I can say is that I generally am not fussy on most of Ystari's graphic design and while Olmypos had graphic design better than earlier games from this publisher, it still didn't jive with me as much as other games. The time-track works as it does most games, but it's not as innovative as it once was. All I can really say is that this game just didn't really work for me and I can't really recall why. I remember thinking to myself, that I would rather be playing Keyaert's Small World instead.

By the designer of Small World, so had to get it.

The game is a lighter civilization game, and comparatively short--less than 2 hours.  

I first encountered the mechanic of spending time to pay for actions in Thebes, and enjoy this mechanic a lot.  I am told it also occurs in Eve.  

The graphics are nice. The layout changes each game and increases replay-ability.  The rules don't address all our questions.  Unlike Small World, the board does not change for the number of players, but instead the number of tiles laid out for the Discoveries & Wonders, does.  This game too, adjusts well to the number of players.  

With more players there is more conflict.  

I enjoyed this game, and when I want to play a short civilization game, would chose this one.  However, given the choice between this game and Small World, would chose Small World.

After 2 plays (4 and 2 players) :

A little bit lost in this straightforward game. Simple without simplistic, i think it is hard to follow a certain line and to keep it. Perhaps because there is an incentive to fight against your opponents as the game progresses (2 of each kind of territories are closed at setup and not accessible for the entire game). As a consequence, the ressources are tight, they change of hand and you often develop what you can not what you wish.

Developpement tree is not easy to read too and timing is very tricky to manage. Too many developpements and one can wait many turns until playing again : this could be problematic and frustating. Not an easy thing to balance.

Need more plays to master this game and increase my rating. For now, i think this is a solid and deep game with a good replayability and learning curve.

A very solid, heavy game from the designer of Small World with many paths to victory and strong player interaction with some abstracted combat. I like the way it uses the "actions cost time" mechanic used by Thebes. Fighting is relatively simple: I can take over your territory no matter what, but I pay "time" to get to your territory (more the further away it is) and additional "time" of an amount depending on which of us has more swords (strength). It can take a very long time to explain what the 30 or so tiles available to buy do, and how they affect one`s ability to build temples (one of the main ways go get points), but they are a cool element of the game. Luck plays a role in the Zeus cards that are triggered as various points of the time track are passed, but the mostly bad effects of these cards can be avoided if one acquires enough Zeus tokens. There`s a lot going on, and I was very impressed with my first play. However, I won't buy this title because of some relatively explicit unfortunate artwork.

I really looked forward to this one. However, when it finally got on the table it frustrated the hell out of me. If your component attacks you he will win automatically, therefore you can not make ANY plans that cannot be easily destroyed before it'S your turn.
It's like Vinci's/Small world "occupying the write spot at the wrong time" , only (felt) much worse.
Rating it 2 would be too rough after just one game, but still it's unlikely that I will try this again.

Megmondom őszintén, nem számítottam semmi extrára, csak valami szokásos ystari játékra, de ehhez képest nagyon kellemes csalódtam. Ugyan, utólag visszanézve egy-két dolgot nem jól játszottunk, ám mégis úgy érzem, hogy nagyon nagy mélység van a játékban. A szabályok nem túl bonyolultak, ám mégis elég sok opció közül választhatsz a körödön. Tetszik az időelköltéses körsorrend, a rengetegféle épület, a területszerzési és csata mechanizmus is. Egyedül csak a design, ami nem tetszik, mivel nincs. Az egész játék úgy néz ki, mintha valaki a prototípushoz netről letöltött volna gyorsan pár képet.

RATING: 6
Olympos' most distinguishing feature is without a doubt the time track, and while that in itself isn't particularly new it is used to good effect here.

The remaining structure of the game is fairly simple: Conquer territories, gather resources, develop achievements, build wonders. I cannot put my finger on anything that is wrong with the game (except for some of the graphics design, possibly), in fact the deterministic combat, the small setup tweaks to change the conditions a little each game and prevent any developments from becoming "the" path to take, and the various ways for players to meaningfully specialize are big plusses in my book.

Nevertheless, it does feel a little rote. There is little sense of actual, gradual development. Players just erratically lurch from one achievement to the next. It also irks me a little that minor differences between players (e.g. four vs. three symbols of something), something which comes about almost incidentally, can have a huge impact. It should also be noted that Olympos provides considerable AP potential.

The gameplay is quite interesting. But the downtime can be very long. If you make an action which costs many timesteps you have to wait until everyone has spent more time than you. If they all do only actions which don't cost many time or spend timemarkers that can last its time.

Quick playing civ-super-lite game from Philippe Keyaerts (Vinci/Small World)  Retains deterministic combat, however it's based on time spent, as opposed to army size. Quite effectively uses the time mechanic from Thebes to determine turn order. Instead of the rise and fall of different civs (Vinci/Small World), Olypmos lets you play one civ that develops over the course of the (actually quite quick) game. While the resource locations on the map are fixed, the discoveries board is randomized, making each discovery have a different cost each game. Further, depending on number of players, the player who goes last in the first round gets to choose a set number of territories to eliminate/block-off from play for the game. Finally, destiny and god cards throw in some events that need to be reacted to.

Plays well with 2.

If you like Evo and Smallworld/Vinci, you will like this.  If you don't like those two, this is not the civ game you are looking for.  It has mild direct conflict and many ways to score points.  The actions of the gods add some real chaos.  Proto, so unranked.

Fantastic game! 

Foremost, fantastic graphics, that allow you to dive into the theme. Really well done. They bring up the images of those times and encompass you with the feeling, you're actually there. 

Gameplay is very tense. So many options. Great options at that! You'd like to do everything, but time is of value. Literally, as it's used as money. Since every action costs time. And time is money. And we know we don't always have enough time to do what we want to do, even in real life. This game portrays that very well. 

You have to plan carefully. Be very adamant about your moves and think forward. Great mechanism of picking up resources and then losing them, when you walk away from a region. Like in those times, you're not going to carry everything with you, will you? Then you have plan accordingly. 

The Gods aspect of the game and some nakedness gives this game even a better feeling, making it even more immersive, as Gods are perfect creatures with perfect bodies. 

I can only recommend this game very much. Another great hit from the house of Ystari. AAA+

RATING: 7
Nice effort in the sub-genre of simple civilization games with Euro mechanics. Here the focus is on "discoveries", and the map is basically a way to take the resources needed to get them. Combat is abstract and deterministic, and not too frequent. The game flows well, making good use of the time track from "Thebes".

However, I have a feeling that getting swords and Zeus symbols may be too important. If you don't get any of the former, you invite other players' attacks, and without the latter, you are harmed by half of the events. Also, cards may be too random, as you often get a few you just can't use, but no card is too powerful.

On the production side, it's obvious that Ystari cut corners. Although the cards and tokens are of good quality, the discovery board is just paper, and the map board is quite small. It should at least be a little larger, in order to align edges with the discovery board, but ideally they should have been made as a single mounted board.

The main game is pretty much luck-free and not bad, but then we have those unnecessary cards that kill the game for me. Some tiles look a bit unbalanced and the space where you can get one god-symbol is pretty much overrun by the players, as it's the only of it's kind.

All in all, not really bad, but nothing I need to own.

Temporary, sometimes painfully, area control. Optimization with every move and all the time(heh).

A solid design which combines the time track from threbes with simple small-world-like combat and a technology tree similar to a civilization game.  Im not sure the Zeus cards or the destiny cards add anything to the game, other than a touch of randomness that no one asked for!  It is super well balanced, for better or worse.  Id like to play again.

The tech tree is pretty flavorless and uses terrible iconography where some words would be nice.

After one play, I liked it, but was a little turned off by the conflict (losing territories is painful, and really throws a wrench into your plans -- it's important to have swords!).  But I guess you have to remember to get an hourglass for losing a battle, which is a booby prize that we kept forgetting.

I'm not sure I like how much one's plans can be upset by a slight change in turn order.  You can think that you'll be the next player to get a particular territory or discovery, which will set you up to get something else, but then a player ahead of you manages to gain a bonus from a Destiny or God card which allows them to sneak in and take your target, thus ruining your whole plan.  I don't like it when a small perturbation changes the entire game flow.  But it's a relatively short game, so maybe it's not a big deal -- just lose and play another game.

Another flavor of Vinci (or Small World) from Keyaerts? Not exactly- while the base units and the combat are similar, this one is far more based on resource acquisition and acheivement than in turf held.

Players each take one color for their civilization, which they keep throughout.  The payment for each move is based on time, and like Thebes or Glen More the player who is farthest back in time spent moves next.

But enough final VP lie in achievements from your society that combat may not be the 1st choice on your mind.. . unless you really need that resource location (or if you can see THEY really need it).

I found on a 1st solo play (4 player) that the game seems to flow pretty well, and probably better withe 4 sets of hands.  There seemed like a lot to do each turn- and time is always a short commodity, especially near the end of the track, or when trying to avoid a God visit.

Starting this at a 7, with a great likelihood of this going up.  

This definitely continues to play as a nice Civ-lite, with some decent resource competition, a tech chart, beautiful art and decent theme, Keyaerts well-developed simplified tribal move and combat, combined with the 'Thebes' time mechanism.  I am liking this more as I get it out more - raising to a 7.25

It's ok - without being groundbreaking. The time thing is a Thebes rip-off but that's not a bad thing as Thebes is a good game.

Having this hit the table for the first time with 5 players was...something. Pulled out a victory and a lot of my hair getting there.

I love the AP allowance and plotting to do the getting when the getting is good. Spectacular concept for a 3.5X. The scaling to 5 players was nicely balanced (my closest competition was exactly whom I thought it was).

But this has got to be the first game that frustrated the chuff out of me for the physical mechanics of working with the board and chits themselves. So fiddly. The fiddliest. Discs freaking everywhere. Is that stack in the right order? Did you want to flee? Wait, did you give me that token? Hey, hey...give me a destiny card! What a headache. Impossible to play as fast as it theoretically should, unless you suck every bit of soul from the table and remain completely on task. 

I definitely do not hate it. Far from it. Going to approach it with 3-4 with a board that is cleaner. Have a feeling it will hit from time to time, as less on the board will mean less of a migraine.

A good hybrid game. Olympos is a nice combination of several game mechanics. Especially, the factor of time track mechanism is very interesting. However, the artwork of the game is so terrible. It is very hard to identify the game at a glance. Moreover, the attractive point, time track system, makes the game unfair often. There are very few elements to narrow the gap of time spending among players. The game is easily changed to the rich-get-richer and the poor-get-poorer aspect. It was not my cup of tea.

[b]2 Player Review:[/b]

It's such a pleasant and enjoyable surprise to find a war game that doesn't come down to random luck. I find nothing more disheartening than stacking a battle in my favor, only to loose from a bad die result. Olympos does away with random luck in conflict by using a brilliant always victorious mechanic from the likes of chess. This leaves the active player only to decide whether they want to spend the necessary resources to do so, or not.

The randomness of the Olympos cards and the tech tiles are a great puzzle to solve as you try to figure out what to take when, and whether you need to beat your opponent to what's available. 



[b]Pros:[/b]

- A game based around conflict that doesn't actually cause conflict between me and Yuki.
- Plays very quickly considering the amount of area control that is going on. 
- Tons of fun trying to combo area control with available technologies, while trying to block others. 
- Balancing use of time with the chance of a double turn is always a fun decision. 

[b]Cons:[/b]
- I actually prefer the game with two players, as more players increase the sense of being dominated. 
- Need the expansion for more tech choices, otherwise the game gets a little repetitive with the same strategies being used. 
- I wish the game had been popular enough to see other maps be made for some more variety (Though they probably would of had to change the name of the game, lolz).

There is quite a bit of setup considering the short play time of this game.  It's a light civ, and IMO, much more fun than 7 Wonders.  Takes about an hour to play, and turn order changes a la Tinner's Trail according to the time spent on your turn.  Very fun for the time commitment involved.

This is a very good game but what put it over the edge for me was it's simplicity and play length.  I think we didn't expect to really like the game when we played it in the Rio Grande demo area at the 2013 WBC.  However, we really did and I think that there was enough strategy in an hour game with relatively simple rules.  That combo is usually lacking in the strategy department for most other games but it really hit me here.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (October 2011)

It’s been a while since I played Olympos, so I don’t remember all the reasons why I didn’t like it, but I didn´t. It’s a Philippe Keyaerts game and I generally dislike his designs. The theme is pasted on and I didn’t felt I was doing anything with the Greek gods. When and if I play the game again, I will come back and properly comment on it. For now my desire to play it again is in decline.

I had low expectations for this title going in, and while I still don't like to think of it as a "civ game," it's not bad at all.  One of the better implementations of the time track concept.  I'm not sure how much I care for the volatility of resources (when taken away) - seems to reduce forward planning.  Then again there weren't that many attacks in our first game so perhaps I don't need to be so concerned.

RATING: 6
Decent Euro with tech upgrades and some interaction at least beyond nabbing tiles before others - although that's very much part of it too. I was annoyed to be "gotcha'd"' by the card that gives you an extra temple - that one seems way more powerful that the rest given it can grab you one of the big scoring points tiles which can be game-changing. It was in my game...it cost me the win. Not that I'm bitter....

Admittedly, I am breaking my own rule by rating this after just one play.  Despite its great art and some interesting game play mechanics/elements, it just can't hold a candle to Cyclades/Kemet, which have s common theme and gameplay elements, respectively.  Thus, contextually at least, it is not a game I will keep around.  

In our group's opinion, it bears similarity to Small World; a seasoned gamer familiar with Small World will be able to see Kayearts stamp here.  The symbology presents a slight barrier to the game flow, and some of the limitations (i.e. rules for play) of the game give it a restrictive, mechanical feel instead of a true civ- builder feel.  A good effort, but ultimately, not fun enough for us.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Disappointing after one play.  This is another attempt at a euro-wargame which falls too heavily on the euro side, stripping the thematic stuff out.  This is NOT a civ game - its a euro game with an ancient civ theme.  Cyclades is much the better civ game.  Tempus is also a considerably better civ game.  WAY too much of the design is devoted to forcing the players into 'agonising decisions', rather than let the players create the decision tension from their own interactions.

I can appreciate Olympos with a certain detachment but it's not my style of game.

Design-wise, the goal here is to take the "civilization" style of play (expand on a map, claim resources, develop technologies, build wonders) and heavily streamline it without losing replayability. Olympos does this quite successfully. The map will always be slightly different and the technologies will always assign to different costs from session to session, which some incentives to specialize along paths that are also variable from session to session. That's all very clever. 

Nevertheless the play itself feels tame. This is one of those games with a couple of important thresholds that players compare (favor with Zeus, armaments) - a symbol here and there have a big impact. There is quite a bit of mild optimizing but little sense of accomplishment. Building never feels like progress or payoff, just baby steps along the way. 

A game can either have robust dynamics or creative content within a smooth structure. This has functional content within a smooths structure and no engaging dynamics to speak of. 

"Functional content within a smooth structure" is more than some games can boast. The structure is well done. The play within it could be a lot more interesting.

Olympos takes the time mechanism from Thebes and combines it with a combo building civ game. The result is more pleasant and much more thinky than I was expecting from reading the rules. My concern that it will be a random who-gets-hit-the least fest was unfounded. There's a lot to plan for and in the end the better plan should usually win. But Olympos needs experienced players who know their options. Better learn it with three players as our five newbies game took well beyond two hours. The colourful graphic style didn't help in conveying the needed information although it is a step up for Ystari in appearance.

This game has its merits. The theme is boring and the artwork is uninspired, but the decisions are interesting and there is just the right amount of conflict.

However, there are three big strikes against the game. First, it takes way too long. If it came in under an hour, I would be more open to it in the long run. Second, the fact that you can get kicked out of power in a city on your opponent's turn but then come back and take it back on your turn feels dumb. Third, some of the cards are way more powerful than others.

If I was guaranteed that it was going to play more quickly, I would definitely like to try this again, but I'm not sure if this has enough going for it to make it stand out among a very crowded field.

RATING: 7.4
+ rather quick for a civilization game
+ beautiful artwork
+ a lot of freedom in choices (you can move as many spaces as you want if you are willing to spend enough action points on it)
+ not very agressive game but still plenty of interaction between players

- relatively long setup
- too many rules and symbols need to be learned for such a quick game
- not very exciting for me unfortunately, a large part of the game just felt like resource grabbing (and you can't be stopped from getting what you want)

In many ways a boring experience: all the information available game, where you have to figure (=solve) the tech-tree how to maximise your score, but in the same time other players can ruin your plan (without actually even knowing what are you trying to do). And when you include here a BIG usability issue and a lot of downtime = no thanks. Sorry, but this is not for me.

Players take actions based on their position on a time track, along the lines of Peter Prinz' Thebes. (Says Demaegd, "This is mainly a coincidence because Philippe designed this game years ago.") By spending time, players take actions, with the choices being expansion or development. Expanding brings new settlers onto the game board, which depicts Greece and Atlantis, which lets you conquer territories and thereby acquire resources.

RATING: 7.2
Good game. Nothing revolutionary: some basics from Keyaert's Vinci/Small world + the Thebes time track + usual civilization-building stuff more or less in a 7 Wonders way (resources, 'battles') + the usual Ystari (not wholly unnecessarily) overcomplicated "several ways to gain points, several paths to victory" special cards.

Played once, 4p.  Really, not a bad engine building, worker placement game with a time track mechanic.  Not very reminiscent of Vinci/Small World as well (which is good imho).  Rating is penalized by the imbalanced global event cards, which are either slightly bad for one or more players, or very very good for one or more players, and influencing who gets affected is tough and uncertain.  I thought the game would've worked JUST fine with this mechanic toned way down.

RATING: 8.5
A bit reminiscent of Cyclades in terms of map, theme, units & wargamy feel with lots of euro mechanics, etc.  The discoveries put a civilization type twist on things.  There's also something of Vinci/Smallworld with burning resources (actions) to compete for territories which you want to control.  Well designed & balanced with various paths & strategies, nice combos in discovery and a bit of random to mix things up.  Endgame really suffers from AP, so be ready for the last fifth of the turns taking half the game length.  Like anything wargamy, can certainly suffer from "bash the leader" & "I don't think I can't win so lemme screw your game".

After one play :

Unlike some other people, this game delivers what I expected from it. It has a mix of great mechanics (one of which is the awesome Thebes timetrack, one of my favorite mechanics), multiple possible strategies, pretty ok theme... If it depends on me I'll bring this to the table a LOT. 

The biggest downside I see is the potential for huge AP, but that comes with the game mechanics, and I like those so I guess you can't have both. But even for an AP game it's fast, so it's really ok for me.

Also I don't like the player colors, big contrast with the flashy colors of the board and tiles. Especially the gray, what's up with that...

For me this is Keyaerts' best game, and for some reason it doesn't get the justified positive attention it deserves.

And by the way, stop calling this a smallworld-like game, because it completely isn't ! Smallworld is overrated, Olympos is underrated !

The premise was good: A light civ-building with a map element and without a devastating war component. 

The best part about it was how combat was abstracted out: Attacker always wins, it's just a matter of how much time they spend to take over the territory. The Thebes-style turn order through the time track was also pretty neat.

The rest of the game wasn't very appealing though:
- Random god cards that help the leader or put those who need most help down.
- Random destiny cards that could have absolutely nothing to do with what you're doing.
- A static civilization board that everybody stares at in silence like Splendor.
- Players taking some of the resources you desperately need next turn without even being aware of it.
- Too much downtime (with 4), especially since your plans for the upcoming turn could be smashed in a second.
- Too long for what it was (it ended up being about 2 hours I think).

Move on. This is not the civ game you're looking for.

The AP prone should not apply. The rest of us will find Small World for advanced players with a pseudo tech-tree; the tree is randomized but only in the costs that you'll pay and given that the available board spaces change each game there is a great amount of variability in each play.

It uses the time mechanism from Neuland/Jenseits to magnificent effect. I especially like that each player has their own separate end game trigger (timing not condition) and that they immediately get one last turn; though they sacrifice bonus points to do so. There seems to be some room for brilliant timing decisions here.

A total surprise.

RATING: 8
Much better design and complicated compared with Small World. You need to balance a lot of things, not to mention the 'time-track' ? borrowed from Thebes. Rating is based on single game with the expansion (and played with the Spelibox variant), which is a must, in my opinion. I could never imagine playing this game repeatedly without the variation provided by the expansion.
See my comment on the expansion.
edited on 20/8/2012: Can't keep my mind away from this game! The game reminds me so much of TTA, in which 1 of my game-mates commented as 'controlling a spider moving'. Olympos is the more abstract but faster version. You need a bit of swords, a bit of zeus tokens, a bit of development to win. Let's play again!

Was there a theme in this game?

A lot of complexity and "things you should know to win the game", for almost no game fun (unless you enjoy buying tiles that hardly show what they are good for). Long waiting times, since there are so many things to take into account and you really have to wait till its your turn to make decisions, since others can make your plan impossible.

On top of that, the board from which you buy tiles is big and cluttered. You can hardly see, when you are on the wrong side of the table, what you can buy and what it will cost you -> Bad component and board design.

Very bad game that I won't play a second time. It's just a waste of time that I like to spend on much better games.

RATING: 7
Getting acquainted with Olympos with five players, none of whom has played before, is probably not the ideal entry, so my impressions from that one game are not all that trustworthy. That said, we all agreed that while the graphics of the board and the cards are both attractive and functionable, the same can’t be said for the development tiles and their storing board. Probably this becomes less irksome with more experience, but we frequently and fervently wished for bigger, louder icons and more subdued illustrations.

The game itself, a marriage of Jenseits von Theben’s timetrack and somewhat combative area control, is fresh and very well done. I especially liked the compensation for being attacked, which keeps everybody in the game even if they are picked on a lot. What keeps this from being more than an 8 for me (apart from the graphics) is the suspicion that the combination of the timing mechanism and a narrative arc where the big points tend to be made at the end can make for excruciatingly long final turns. But there is enough good stuff here that I’m hoping for this to be just an artefact of our inexperience.

After one play : it was pleasing, remarkably intuitive and challenging. My feeling, though, was that it's a bit too long (60-80min) for the kind of interest it offers (I'd suggest it's close to something like 7 Wonders, which is notably shorter in time but with roughly the same complexity).

Later, after a second play : This game has its merits, but it confirms that I don't enjoy P. Keyaerts' designs. They have too many variables to fit into my brains, so I can't set up a valid strategy. It's ok for a party- or strongly thematic game, but this is a Euro and I don't like not feeling at least partly in control in a Euro.

Rules make the game seem much more complicated than it is. However, it does have some depth and would like to play this one again. Very easy to catch on to in a round or two. Not really an area control game, even though areas can be taken from other players. More an auction/use your resources wisely/civ game. Thought this one was pretty fun. I was impressed with how successful a civ game it is in such a short playing time. Edit: I rate this one a 7, but I believe that the rating will go up with another couple of play throughs.

10/16/11 Played a three-player game. It had an economic and military aspect that worked in conjunction with the Discovery tiles. It didn't overstay its welcome. Though I can't say it broke any new ground. On the negative side, the rules explaining the destiny cards are inadequate. And I thought the lumber and grain symbols were too close to the same color for easy recognition. The lumber was brown, and the grain was golden brown. Plus the icons were so "busy" it was extremely hard to tell what they were without squinting at them. Why they didn't just use a simple sheaf of wheat for the grain is beyond me. Basically all the artwork had a overwrought quality. Anyway, I look forward to playing it again, with either 4 or 5.

Interesting mechanisms don't always make for an enthralling game. As a Ystari fanboy, and someone who likes the Keyaerts style of doing things, I really looked forward to this one. There is a lot to like - the cards tucked under the board, the Vinci-style move and combat system, the 'time track'... but it doesn't mesh as well as I'd hoped. One to play again because I had high hopes.

After a half dozen plays, this game is wearing a little thin. It initially felt easy to explain and somewhat interesting to play, but I've found myself less engaged in each successive play and question its playability at almost every player count. Five is too long and too chaotic, making attempts to be strategic quite tough. Military is probably dominant with three, scaring off the other two players and easily acquiring multiple wonders through conquering starred regions. The two-player variant is just too wide open and non-competitive.

So this game is best with four, but it's not special enough to advocate for it at such a specific player count. I considered pulling it every once in a while for variety, but that means there will always be a new player, and the game takes forever to explain, despite its relatively simple play. I'm glad to have traded it away locally, so I still get to play it but no longer need to bring/advocate/teach it.

(I also first played this immediately after the disappointing Rise of Empires. Here was a streamlined development track done right, so I was quite pleased. But that alone hasn't made for a fully compelling game.)

The search for the ever elusive 90 minute Civilization game is never ending, but one game may be taking the top of the heap in the mean time. That of course is Olympos! Yeah, you remember Martin Wallace's super over-hyped master of all psuedo-civ and complete let down, Tempus? Well, Olympos is what Tempus "should" have been. And there is no hype at all around it. Gamers are so fickle. Olympos is 90 minutes of complete mind-melting strategy machine. No, you can't drink a beer and chit chat about what your kids did between turns because you're working. This one you need a plan, a deep and well thought out plan, so of course it's a game that will need several plays just to figure out what the hell kind of stuff works. It's got a great Jenseits von Theben turn sequence where the last player on the VP track goes first, so a player could take several turns in a row before getting ahead of the other players. I only question if it'll be a game where after several plays if certain optimal paths work the best. I can't tell right now. What I can tell you is this is full of beefy goodness, and me being a self confessed Civ. whore, this really works.

One of my favourite games of 2011. It is fast, involves plenty of interraction and Has a different set up each game! The only downside is that with 5 players if they do not take their turns quickly then the downtime can be a problem.
The use of the time based turns track ( as used in Thebes) works really well and the game flows along as players expand their empires.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

A light civilization game. The map looks like it should creates conflict, but it discourages (just a little) to do warfare as you will lose action points. Different paths of victory, and you always feel like you need to hurry for doing things you want or else your opponent would take the opportuity, be it attacking the lands you want or developing technologies. 

The only downside is the icons, which is very confusing unless you print a player aid to help the players.

This game is the game I wish Small World was.  I love the simplified combat and area control.

Olympos makes use of a time track, similar to Thebes, and a resource "availability system" to pay for developments which is akin to 7 Wonders. Players expand their territories, gaining access to resources, which in turn allow new tech to be developed. Combat is very, very simple, and has minimal impact on losers. The different technologies synergise nicely, encouraging players to explore new combos and find different strategy.
Rules need better editing and proofreading, and Olympos desperately needs player aids.

There are qualities about this game that I really like: 1) There is a limited amount of time in the game for each player and actions take varying amounts of time; 2) battling back and forth between players uses up time, so it's got to be used judicially; 3) it's fast.  But given this, I have an unfulfilled feeling after the game finishes.  I probably need a few more plays and will perhaps take the game for what it is instead of trying to fit it into civilization mold.  It may improve over time as a light to mid-weight game.

underwhelming. It uses the Thebes/Tinners Trail time track mechanic. You either bring people (disks) on and move them around , or you buy a tile. The tiles either give you powers or victory points, and to buy them you have to control the appropriate territories or pay resource cubes. So far so good. Things I didn't like:
*Lots of direct conflict, players can choose pretty freely who to attack, and if you get attacked a lot that will neutralise any good decisions you make. You can make it more time consuming for others to attack you by buying tiles with sword icons, but buying that tile itself is time consuming. 
*Gods: basically random events that get triggered now and again and they reward/punish the player(s) with the most/least 'Zeus symbols'. They are not very powerful and I can't see how they improve the game. I suppose they add a small 'arms race' for Zeus symbols.
*Large tech grid: players can freely buy any tech they like (assuming resources), and then choose a small bonus from 2-3 options. So you have to consider which techs you want to buy before you decide where to move your people. I felt that there were too many good options and the broad decision tree is AP inducing. Also any disk could move anywhere on the map at any time.   
[ImageID=1032031]
*Scoring: there were no 'main line' scoring engines: you get some points for territory, some for techs, some from chips you pick up, some as multipliers on other things (like the Puerto Rico big buildings) and some from bulk-point tech tiles.

This game feels quick! I thought it would be about conquering territories. But it is more about developing and making an engine run. I thought it would be similar to "Cyclades" but it is more similar to "Pantheon" in that respect. The players are jockeying for good positions on the map to being able to buy the right "discoveries/developments" and "wonder". It can really hurt if some players team up against on e person and conquer all places someone is in. This might be a problem with additional plays. Still I like it, am happy having bought this and look foreward in playing it more. PS. The Zeus cards can be devastating! Don't underestimate them. :)

Based on one play: Using time you take control of areas on the board and using resources from these areas you get technologies that help you bend the rules. The basis of play is time and everyone has the same amount so you must spend it wisely and play always goes to the person who has spent the least amount of time.

Like Keyaerts's earlier games, Evo and Vinci/Small World, Olympos features trying to control regions on a map with your tokens using deterministic combat.  Unlike those games, however, most of the victory points in Olympos come from purchasing technologies; controlling the map regions give you access to resources with which to buy those technologies.  The techs themselves provide a wide variety of benefits, including moving and combat on the map, discounts on future techs, and, of course, victory points.  In any case, I thought that this was a good game, but didn't have anything in it to elevate it to great.

This game is kind of a mess. It's got excellent artwork on god cards and techs (and even some boobies and most of a cock! Tee hee!), but the board is dysfunctional and fugly. The protracted setup where one person nullifies a number of regions could really have gone the way of the dodo and I wouldn't have minded. Maybe with a modular map or just a smaller one. resources being split up by reusable and non-reusable was odd, especially since obtaining non-reusable resources was as hard/harder than getting the permanent ones.

One play so far and I found it to be a very frustrating  gaming experience. The problem for me with this game is that if someone takes that one resource you need to acquire that development/wonder, there is really no alternative, you can't just buy something else, because of the strict building costs. So you have to reconquer or go to an other region with that resource, which costs you time and by the time you have an other turn, someone else could have taken away that or an other resource need, so you have to do that again.

From my one play so far, I also believe that you can't win this if you don't have military power and I hate games where you can't win without that one thing. Hopefully further play will prove me wrong.

Second play: confirms my thought that you can't win this game without military power. The player without was slaughtered in this game.

3rd game: everybody understood the importance of military, which made of a more tight, less aggresive game.

This is a civ-building game that is fast to play but relatively deep. It is better than Vinci and significantly better than Smal World. (Both from the same designer.) the decisions are tough especially with the speed of play. There is so much you want to do but time, and your opponents, require that you make some tough decisions. 

The first game can be a mess. Learning what the various technologies can do is tough enough but then planning a long term strategy (in the first game) is almost immpossible. Just write it off as a learning experience. What is especially enjoyable is the need to plan long term. For a one hour game this is unusual. You cannot wait for your turn and then decide what to do. You need a plan from early on and then attempt to implement it. A very good game.

RATING: N/A
This is a nice civ-esque game, where you place and move your disks on the board to take territories, and then spend resources to buy upgrade tiles. The interesting thing that makes this game special is the way you do those things is by spending time. You advance your marker on a 'time track' and whoever is in the back of the track gets to go next. Careful players can line themselves up to take several actions in a row depending on how other players have spent. There is a lot of taking each other's provinces in this game, but a player's disks are never removed from the board, so the loss isn't overly punishing. It is possible for two players to conflict each other out of being able to win, and with 5 players the downtime between turns can be immense, especially if you take an action that results in a big time expense, such as buying a new tile. Additionally, the iconography is too small and unclear, which is frustrating as they really leave a lot of room for the beautiful illustrations in the game. Overall we enjoyed this, although I don't know I'll play with 5 players again.

Only played it once an we (not we but the rules explainer) got half the rules wrong or forget about them, so playing this felt like holding on to water with your bare hands. Anyhow, I liked the overall structure but I felt that there is not much there but the sum of its parts. Neat Euro mechanics with resource collection, a bit of area control, but again, not enough interaction to make it interesting. Taking over enemy territory is just as expensive for you as it is for the victim (most of the time) so it feels more or less like a bargain than warfare. The endgame feels a bit obscure, is it triggered, is it not triggeres. But hey, there is BOOBS in the game, amazing.

Uses a time track like Glen More or Tinner's Trail, etc. but this time it's a light civilization game where you expand, earn technologies and build wonders, and hope the gods will smile upon you and frown on your opponents. It's decent but not compelling. Expansion bits help a little and are nice to have.

Meh.

Yet another economic engine, resource management cube pushing Euro.

Perhaps the most clever part of this game is that the the cost of discoveries (special powers you purchase throughout the game, apparently a mandatory feature of all Euros) are randomized at the start of each game, which can potentially give a lot of variety to the game. In your typical tech "tree" Euro, the resource chain (i.e. you need resource A to get resource B to get resource C and so on until you get a victory point) is static. In Olympus, this resource chain changes each game.

Unfortunately, this variable resource chain undoubtedly causes a lot of AP. I don't mind AP if it involves trying to manipulate your opponents to achieve your goals. However, as in many Euros, this is about trying to figure out the system, not your opponents, which I find unsatisfying.

It appears to me that the Small World comparison comes from the fact that conquering your opponent's regions is similar; you need a fixed amount of action points, and it is deterministic. I thought this would have added a good deal of player interaction to the game, but this game, at its heart, is a Euro economic engine game, not a direct conflict game; you attack a player is a consequence of building your economic engine, not primarily to bring down your opponent.

A really interesting mix of different mechanics. The game seems simple at first glance, but the discoveries create some pretty intense strategy potential. There is luck involved in the destiny/olympos cards, but after a while players will know what to expect from these decks and be able to increase odds in their favor. I can see how Small World might have had some influence in the combat, but overall Olympos stands on its own as a very solid game. Watch the time track closely!

RATING: 5
Area control Euro game with a nice turn order mechanic: Different actions take a different amount of time and its  the player's turn, who has used time the least so far. With 5 players this mechanism can lead to quites some downtime, if you did a time consuming action, you might have to wait for several actions till it is your turn again. Depending on the areas you control you can buy technologies with the goal to build some wonders in the end. Random event cards (actually the order in which they appear is random) will boost/hurt players which are doing well/bad in a God's favor category. 

In total a sound Euro game, but for me there was nothing special about it. Ancient Greece/Rome is also one of my least favourite themes; so no bonus points from that direction. The art work did not change my mind on this either.

Prinz's time track based turn order in a civilization building game with troop movement, resource production capabilities (as in 7 Wonders), and conflict (the attacker always wins, but it costs more time points if he is weaker). Building discoveries (using your resource production capacity) is expensive but critical to progress along the technology track and expand your civilization more effectively.  Star acquisition enables the construction of wonders for end of game VPs. Finally, each time Zeus is passed on the scoring track events enter the game, helping the most pious and unleashing wrath on the least. Territories owned, discovieries, wonder points, and various bonuses (achieved through cards, etc.) are totalled for end of game scoring.

This is a medium complexity points scoring Euro. It borrows quite a few mechanics from other places, but remains essentially an optimisation game - gather resources, turn them into techs, use those to further develop resources and ensure all of this results in the maximum number of points. The games visual design is a little confusing in places and there are a lot of counters that seem to exist purely for book-keeping (and then surprising absences of counters at moments when you might want to book-keep).

Some of the comments here describe this game as unexciting, unfulfilling and bland. There is a game here that works well, but these comments are apt descriptors of an immensely disappointing experience.

I really hate to say that, as I had been looking forward to giving this game a try. It's unfortunate that one of the best mechanics (time track) is lifted directly from Thebes and Tinner's Trail. Everything else seems stale and slightly uninteresting. My view of this game would be comparable to something like Comuni, to which I say: yes... it's just another euro.

I'd like to give it a few more tries to see if my opinion changes. As pointed out by some, there seems to be a bias toward the military route: the weak will get picked on. As the game ran on, I couldn't help but think of something I'd much rather play: Cyclades. I reckon Olympos aspired to be a game like that but somewhere along the way fell short.

Plays nicely from 2-5 players, although when playing with the two player variant I'd remove the Nemisis Olympos card from the game because if it comes out late it's too decisive in a two player game.

Rules are clear and the game plays in about 60-90 minutes depending upon the number of players.

Like most of the offerings from Ystari Games there's a number of ways of scoring points here and there, but in Olympos it feels a little more structured.

Player interaction is nicely balanced with aggressive, yet relatively low aggression moves. Conquests always succeed, but at differing costs. The truly in your face aggressive moves are the snatching of development tiles and wonder tiles out from another player's nose. Good stuff.

There's a nice level of re-playability through the different board setup and order and placement of development tiles. Games are going to be similar, but not the same by any means.

My criticism of the game is is reserved for the lack of text on tiles and cards and use of icons. Sure it means only the rules and box has to be swapped out between editions, but at a huge cost. New players have to refer to the rulebook or self printed player aides for two sets of cards and development tile translations. After a game you won't need to do this anymore, but it kind of spoils the first play when players are already trying to come to grips with building costs and flow of the game and all the other first play learning that needs to be done. Resorting to purely icons on components doesn't do the game any favours. And that's a pity because it's a very good game. Nice player aides included with the game could be used to overcome this in future editions.

What if Thebes was a civ game?  Play Olympos and find out!

With five players, too long and with too much incremental grit in the system.  Not bad, just tiring; but then I find a lot of mid-heavyweight euros the same sort of tiring these days.  If I'm going to spend more than three hours playing something, I want to redraw the map of central Europe at least.

Olympos is an abstract civ-lite in which players quite literally spend their time conquering lands and developing technology. It occupies a niche as a combative Euro, as it is necessary to keep leaders in check by taking away territories vital to them. 

That said, the calculative mindset required to constantly optimise time really doesn’t click with me. Unlike the author’s lighter [thing=40692][/thing], battles in Olympos are purely deterministic with the amount of time consumed being the only factor in combat. The game is also held back by dull tech options as well as suboptimal graphic design on the map and territory tokens, rendering it rather difficult to read the game situation easily.

It’s a solid design, but just not what I’m looking for in a civ-lite game.

Always a bit wary of rating after one play but here you go: simple rules and mechanics that are actually fairly slick. But to four newbies the iconography of the board was a real hurdle to get over - Discovery Tiles aren't named and what they do is rarely clear. Familiarity would lick this issue but when the first play involves constantly checking the rules throughout a two-and-a-half hour session I'm not sure familiarity would ever be reached. It's a good game that is let down by the design of board elements, especially the Discovery/Wonder board. A shame as a more thoughtful design and I think this might be a lot more popular.

1 play, 3er

Should rate it a 4, really, but I could be convinced to try it again and it seems like it's a better game than that!

Interesting idea: expand in ancient Greece, develop technologies, build stuff, score prestige. But then you've got:
- random God effects that can really reward some players, punish others
- an ugly board, though the card art and illustrations are nice
- annoying icons for resources (not easy to distinguish at a glance)
- really annoying way to gain/lose resources; you can go take a territory for someone else, only to have them take it right back ... makes it frustratingly difficult collecting the combination of resources you need to buy whatever you're trying to buy! 

I might try it again if someone else were to bring it out, but I'd be much happier selling my copy!

--- Summary ---
The main board shows a map of Greece and the area, with 3 islands of Atlantis to the south. These are divided into regions, each of which produce a type of resource (Olympos also gives you a Zeus token); some also have a star icon. There's also a time track, with event spaces scattered throughout (place Zeus cards there) -- players place their tokens on the track stacked (earlier in turn order on top). A side board shows all the technologies and associated costs, divided into several groups (costs randomized within each group).

The player furthest back on the time track takes their turn. On your turn, either:
1. EXPAND. 
- Add a token either to the launching area in the north, or to somewhere you already have a token showing. Then, move that token to a legal space. If you end in a region with another player's token, place yours on top. Moving and conquering costs time (more if your strength is weaker): move your time marker forward appropriately. When taking control of a region, take a resource MARKER of the type there (from the bank if empty region; from the current controlling player if occupied).
- If a marker reaches an event space, player draws a card (gives you something, eg VP for fulfilling certain conditions, resource cube, etc.) which may be used at any time on their turn. If it was the first marker to reach the space, a Zeus event card also triggers. Many spaces also trigger when the last player reach them. Half the event cards are good (e.g., reward player w/ most Zeus heads a resource), half bad (e.g., player with fewest Zeus heads loses a card).
-- OR --
2. DEVELOP.
- Acquire a tech by paying the cost -- either by spending the matching resource CUBE or _having_ (but not spending) the resource MARKER. These give you various effects, such as:
... increased military strength
... Zeus heads
... stars
... VP
... reduced building costs
- These also reduce the cost of artifacts (high VP tiles, paid for with stars)

The game ends when the last player reaches a mark on the time track; get VP for having used less time at the end. Most VP wins.

I like how the combat rules allow takeover of an area but the loser isn't really punished, he can just move his piece elsewhere.  The special powers are nice and the area control is dynamic since what you need may change throughout the game.  A rare fast-paced civ game.

First impression was very positive. The artwork is fine, the rules are very well written apart from a few minor details and the interaction is neat. I like games that copy other's mechanics because it means that their designers are smart enough to reinvent something at their benefits. I want to play it again before rating it because I need to consolidate more my opinion. I got the impression that the game works pretty well with 3 and 4 players but have to check it properly.

The graphic design is a complete cluster F**k.

Poor colour differential where it matters on the techs and and resources and garish and unnecessary on the board. The board is so ugly that it took four of us 15 minutes to recognise it as a map of Greece

The different resource diagrams are too intricate for the size of the tokens as well. Why does this matter? Because the most important thing you will do in this game is plan your developments around your board presence - and if spend half of your game time trying to work out which little squiggle on the board matches another little squiggle on another board at the other side of the table the game fun goes out of the window.

The art has the same feel as 'Smallworld', however for less money SmallWorld is a much classier production than this game - better components and board

The game? I like the 'Thebes' time use, the rest comes to a crunching AP hell towards end of game as there is a lot of min mixing- which can be a waste of time as the destiny cards can be a luck fest - 'oh I got one that rewards the max of something i dont have and cant get', 'oh you got one that gives you 3 hour glasses for your wood'. Nice. Now i dont complain about the randomness in Pantheon but in a tech. driven, timing is crucial game I do.

The Olympos cards seemed to under punish the heathen and under reward the pious

Replayability? Garbage - the same techs get shuffled to cost different combinations of resources - a little like saying the 'Oakey Cokey' becomes a new dance if you put your right foot in before the left.

It's a deceptively simple game to learn despite all the iconography and moving parts, but like many games that hide their depth below straightforward mechanisms, it takes a game to figure out how it all works together.  Physically, the game art is beautiful while the components are quite average, although it would be nice if the icons were a little larger and able to be distinguished from opposite ends of the gaming table.  Thematically, it's a subject matter that I would normally find quite exciting, but it just doesn't come through really well in the numbers-counting game play.  So in the end, while I admire the game design, the elusive "fun factor" just wasn't quite there for me.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 6/10

RATING: 6
Fast-playing civ-lite with pasted-on theme. The best part about it is the "time track" turn order mechanism, where each action takes [i]n[/i] time and moves you ahead [i]n[/i] spaces; the player at the back is always the next to move.

There's a lot of randomness in the cards, and negative-sum combat for needed resources in a tight board can make it frustratingly difficult to do anything useful. It also seems like it runs too short.

Not a [i]bad[/i] game, but not one I'll go out of my way to play again.

[RGG 2011 edition] {Civilization; time-track, resource management, development; optimal 4p} I bought Olympos because it's classified as a civilization game; however, I think the theme is just ok.  Over the game, players are usually focused on the resources and tiles, rather than feeling of expanding / developing a civilization.

The game is solid and well designed.  There are nothing new in the mechanics.  The rules are easy to understand.  It is also interactive in resources competition, discovery tiles and wonder competition.  The game should be replayable due to the random placement of tiles and map setup.

I don't think this game is highly strategic (esp. with 5p); it's more about adjusting a tactic in times of competition and player order.  Nevertheless, players have form an idea of how to pursue prestige based on the initial discovery tile placement.

The Zeus is just too strong in a 5p game; esp. when the time track consumed fast.

The components are nice and handy.   The icons are easy to understand.  The illustration is good.  However, I think a player aid should be included to tell the end game scoring, which makes game play easier.

RATING: 8
Excellent replay value due to the initial set-up of the discovery tiles. The time track feature was in fact the one feature which was present in the first prototype version from the early 2000's ; it felt to me as a most original design idea at that time.

Disclaimer: I was playtester for this title in the early versions (5+ years ago), and then only briefly for the latest prototype version before the 2011 release.

I do not enjoy games where I can't plan my moves at all. No telling what the board will look like when it's your turn again. Anyone can take a crucial territory from you and your plans will fail. Sure you can conquer the territory back, but someone can take it from you again before it's your turn again to actual use its resource. 

Love the time aspect of the game. You can be able to take multiple turns before your opponents. But still, not my kind of game.

Brilliant game.  Should get more exposure, Like a gamers Small World.

Easy rules, deep, fun gameplay, does not go on too long but feels meaty.  Art is fantastic.  The meddling gods feel thematic, the battle for Zeus causes much tension, the time mechanism is brilliant, Just the right amount of conflict. The random setup will keep the game interesting over many plays. Have played 2-4 players and it plays great at all counts, best at 4 i think.  Would love the expansion.

I rather enjoyed the main mechanics of Olympos, an area/resource-control game that uses a similar time mechanic to that in Thebes. The available discoveries mesh well with the game, and seem balanced while offering very different strategic options. But the game isn't riveting and I never felt my choices were all that difficult ... you mainly just worry about whether another player is going to screw with your plans. And that, perhaps, is the game's biggest failing in my mind - I'm pretty certain that the player who gets picked on least is going to win just about every time. Olympos is a pleasant enough experience, but falls squarely in the good rather than great category.

Difficult to comprehend the slightly fiddly scoring until you've played it through, might be better with more plays.  Wonder scoring seems like it can swing the game too easily.  2 player variant doesn't really work due to the impact of Zeus cards when there's only two people in the running.

Incredibly fun euro that handles conflict in a very clever way - attacker always wins, but he/she ends up paying a high price to occupy the territory.  Feels fragile, but the randomness of the card draw/civ tile distribution helps counterbalance the deterministic combat mechanics.

Very satisfied with how quickly and interestingly this game played out. Everyone in our 5 player game really felt like they were in close contention for winning the game.

Nice Civilization building with a brilliant system for tracking turns and player order. The cards and arrangement of the progress tiles during setup provide just bit of randomness to make each play a different experience. The outcome may be determined more by the whims of the other players than it is by the player's own strategic choices.

Great artwork. The game is simple and plays fast. It has some interesting mechanics and I really like the time track that dictates turn order. Probably this is its best implementation in a game. The game can go fast (90 min) if players are familiar with the different developments. If not, it runs at 2:30 hours with 4 players. There is quite a bit of strategy and the luck that the gods create is actually quite entertaining. A very nice game overall. Definitely, it will earn its place in your library.

RATING: 7
Olympos is a civ-lite game with an interesting turn order/action selection mechanic. Every turn you take an action which costs time. You advance your marker on the time track and then the player whose disc is furthest back on the time track takes an action.

There's a board with provinces that provide resources. You can move markers onto the board, and then around the board, to claim control of those resources. You can spend time to take a territory away from another player. Resources allow you to buy technologies, which generally give you cool powers, points and some bonus goody. There are also wonders that just give points, but require you to subdue natives and/or build specific groups of technologies.

Periodically, as you spend more time, you'll trigger a way to get goody cards and trigger an event (which helps/hurts people depending on whether they've invested in getting "Zeus Masks").

The game ends when you hit a certain time mark, and then you have the opportunity to take one final action.

I liked this game a lot. The one thing I came away with was that I really should have spent more time figuring out what technology paths I wanted to take in the game. Rather than spend a lot of time getting bogged down in AP, I just sorta winged it, and that got me in a bind later on. I think spending a little bit more time on that will make the game more fun next time.

I'm not the world's biggest fan of direct conflict games, where players attach each other... and that's probably the thing I liked least about this game. I notoriously don't understand how to play that kind of game. Invariably, I just don't realize that I'm getting locked into a bad position until too late and then I flail around wildly and start a slapfight with another player... which happened here. (Sorry, Dave.)

RATING: 7
A good game with an interesting use of time - something akin to the one used in [thing=36946][/thing] where your actions take an amount of time, and if, after this action, you are still "behind" the others in the time track, you can make another action. And so on.

A fine set of decisions packed in a rather quick (60-75 minutes) game.

Initial rating. 

The first play was maybe a bit of dissapointing for me. The basic idea is quite simple, but there are lots of things to consider. Also, I think the graphical design could perhaps been better to help understand all the information. Anyway, potential AP risk in the game for sure. 

I think it is a quite nice concept itself, but don't expect any deep Civilization experience with this. Need to play to more to really see how interesting it is in the long run.

edit: rating up from 7 to 7.5 after more plays, I feel better about it. If players are playing fast, it can be a satisfying experience.

[+] not a complicated game once you know the developments and how they can work together, the time track is such a great underused mechanism; development are very costly so must be thought very carefully; some optimisation puzzle to find synergies between dev columns to build wonders
[-] with 5p too few scoring tiles, 1 or 2p will be stuck; not a great sense of achievement (seems too short)

RATING: 5
Not good.  Tries to be both a winner-take-all wargame and a tightly-balanced eurogame, but the combination doesn't work well at all.  There's a huge arms race involved in getting swords so that you can kick other people around the map..  The mechanic gives incentive to pick on the weakest players, because they are least able to defend themselves.  This is the kind of game design flaw that has mostly (thankfully) been left behind in the 80s, and to see it rearing its ugly head here is more than a bit frustrating.  It's not really fun for either the bully or the bullied.

Even worse, there's only the barest whiff of empire-building here.  In reality, this is a tile-purchasing game, reading an initial setup to try to get the most effective combination to the big points, and then using the map as a tool to get there.  Nothing about the map position or the tech tiles will make you feel like you're building an empire, as there's very little sense of progression from beginning to end.

To its credit, the art is wonderful.  There's a lot of art in this game, from the the technology tiles to the cards, to the board, and the coloring and composition is top-notch.  A lot of artistic care was taken with this game to make it look good.  It's a shame the game doesn't live up to the art's promise.

A marvelous game. My first game was explained very bad, I was last in 4 players and I loved the game. That must mean something!
It has everything i love in a game: simple enough (you just have to explain some cards and tiles at the first game but the rules are really simple); many aspects to consider and never to overlook, without being overly complicated like for example could be a Feld game. A good rythm.
Mechanics themselves aren't all original but are among the less exploited: the use of time is similar to Red November but here it is used as its best. I adore the fact that the attacker always wins, it just takes more time if he is weaker than the defender. This is a genial idea! 
You have many small turns, not a few short heavy ones and if you have a long downtime it's only your fault cos you played too much the turn before.

The only negative aspects at the moment are the graphics that is not very clear with the small white yellow orange brown cheats and the lack of a good way to keep track of points at the end. Nonetheless i feel to give this game a 9 because i really really loved it.

Replayability must be high because the important tiles are always shuffled but you have to keep concentrated on a column or two to acquire the monuments and your strategy will vary every time.

Wonderful!

[EDIT]: our second game confirmed this very high rating. this game is pure gold.

[EDIT]: after 5 games, it is still a wonderful experience. I can't understand why the avg rating for this game is just a 7!
The only real problem are components: colours are difficult to tell apart and the tiles board is made of a flimsy cardboard that will break apart soon. Other than that, this game is just great

Light combat area control. Starting in North Greece we migrate our civilization south to Atlantis. Occupying a region gives us access to resources or Zeus favor. Use resources to gain permanent advancements for our civilization.  Suffer or benefit from the whims of Zeus and destiny. I love how time is used as a measure of player turn order and the length of the game. Super fun. I normally do not like direct conflict but this combat system makes it so light and temporary. I guarantee you will forget to replace a resource when you leave a region.

RATING: 7
This is an interesting, fast-paced (AP notwithstanding) game, with plenty of parallel ways to compete, but plenty of opportunities for the players to be pounded by each other and by the gods.  As in [thing=60][/thing], [thing=40692][/thing], and [thing=97786][/thing], there is constant conquest with guaranteed success.  In [thing=92319][/thing], not only is your population a resource you must mind, but so is time, in the sense of a [i]time track[/i], as in [thing=13883][/thing] / [thing=30869][/thing], [thing=35570][/thing], [thing=12681][/thing], etc.  There are developments your civilization can make (e.g. military strength, or general piety) to facilitate aspects of the game for you, and the precise costs for those are randomized (within parameters) each game.  Additionally, high-point-value wonders' costs are reduced by first accomplishing developments that happen to be in the same column this particular game.

This is a solid effort, with plenty of replay value.  The beatdown from the gods for being least pious can feel excessive, but I can testify that being the butt of their joke doesn't necessarily keep you from winning.  Because there's more riding on it than [thing=40692][/thing]'s thin point-scoring mechanism, being conquered can also be more frustrating, but since your populace can remain, dominated, in that region, and uprising is just a turn away, again granting you access to the quarry, or whatever, that you were so frustrated to lose.

Finally, I'd been watching [person=12886][/person]'s art for this since before either the name [i]Olympos[/i] or [i]Atlantys[/i] were associated with it, hoping against hope that all these lush paintings would be for a game that was to my tastes.  Lucky me!

RATING: 8
Kickstarted for $41.
Tentative Rating based on 1 play with 5 players.  Really liked the game, but two slow and long with 5.  Seemed pretty easy to learn it from the rulebook.  Looking to try with 3 or 4 and solo.

Played with 3 and more snappy.  But still quite long.  At the start of each season the choice of actions is quite over-powering and AP kicked in.
But, upgraded from 7 to 8.

LIKE: Theme is very well implemented. I liked the options and the different cards from round to round.
DISLIKE: Keeping track of all the cards's powers and when to rotate is hard to track. Some randomness involved in how the show cards come out, but that's part of the game. Can be a little fiddly, I kept bumping my cubes off the cards. Lots of text on the cards, can be hard to read.

OVERALL: Fun game. I wish the gameplay was a touch smoother, I'm sure getting to know all the cards helps, but it is a solid game overall. Not a lot of interaction, except for the card drafting, so I'm unsure how much replayability it has.

RATING: 6
Some of the cards were funny, but they get old pretty quickly.  Not enough game to keep me interested and felt way too long (even though it probably wasn't).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
It is serviceable as an action selection game with some minor planning. The interesting aspect are the Network cards themselves which adds some variety to planning. There is competition of cards and the scores stay fairly close - although money management is critical which is often driven by timing of dropping out. So not bad overall, but not strong enough in variety of strategic lanes. Might have seen it all after just a few plays?

[u]Impressions after a too-brief two-season run-through[/u]: Great fun for the whole family -- everyone from myself and my wife through my ten-year-old daughter got it and enjoyed it. The "aging out" mechanic for the shows and the declining viewership is cleverly done. I had some questions about money being so tight, but that might just have been bad rules reading on my part (update: it was, we missed the ad income). With so few extra show cards per season, and since I'm anticipating rapid repeat plays, I worry some about replayability. Looking forward to next year's (summer 2017) expansion! Bravo effort. I'm a fan.

[u]UPDATED first thoughts[/u]: Runs a little long for what it is, which is frustrating. Considering giving it a try with three seasons (1-3-5) for abbreviated play at 5p. Looking forward to trying the 2p game to see if that fills a void. I still think it would benefit from extra shows (maybe 2x as many per season), but that may just be a wish on my part for a cosmetic sheen to keep the gags from getting stale. (In fact, more cards would probably upset the genre balance and make the 3/5 show bonuses harder to come by. So just ignore me and me dumb wishes.)

[u]UPDATED 2[/u]: Works great as a 2p. Interaction is limited, which makes it a little solitaireish, but that's okay. Repeated plays have sped up playing time, so that's great. Runaway leader problem? Not sure; we're still fine-tuning our strategies, so it's possibly a non-issue. Our last 2p game got blown wide open during season 5, ending with a 50-point spread (I win! yes, I'm awesome).

RATING: 9
Really fun game that plays surprisingly well solo.  The automa deck provides a pretty tense and realistic experience as you try and build your network before the cards run out.  The theme is fun and the On the Air expansion allows you to create your own shows, which can be as silly as you want.  I think this game will continue to expand as there is room for more shows, stars, etc.

Well-themed economic game.  Big rulebook, but not fiddly.  Played pretty smooth, actually.  The art is nothing short of fantastic.  Well-produced all around!

RATING: 5
1st play: Really love the theme, the mechanics correlate well to the theme  and it's fun to put together show lineups and all of that.  There are some complaints though that I have, which might go away with a second play.  I felt like I was behind and out of the game after the first round, and then due to luck in the final round, I caught up and almost won.  Also some of the show types seemed a lot better than others, and the jokey-ness of the shownames would probably wear off quickly.  These might have been first game learning pains, or might not have.

No 2nd play: Even tho I didn't play a 2nd time, I'm not sure it would have mattered.  Other than the one-time funny jokes, the game wasn't that impressive to me.

RATING: 9.5
#Tentative rating after 2 plays with 4 players with the vanilla game.

Really in love with the mechanics of the game, the theme and the humor. This is probably not a game for those that are looking for huge player interaction. It's more of a game of optimisation and economics where you're mainly trying to increase viewership based on the shows, actors and ads available. Most of the time you'll only be concentrating on your own player board. 

Components : 
- Box came a with a damaged back (poor packaging during shipping). In general, the material for the box could have been sturdier, slight dings on the edges too. 
- The box was big enough and will probably fit a further 1 - 2 expansions
- Player components were of really good quality. Cards, wooden cubes, player tokens, and player boards looked and felt like they'd hold up pretty well. 

Artwork / Theme : 
- Initially wasn't too excited about the art initially. but it really grows on you as the theme and the art really go hand in hand. A really big fan of the artstyle now. Kudos Mr. Heiko!
- The theme shines through brilliantly and you really get the feel that you're actively overseeing a low rate tv network in the beginning and by the end of the game, you're racking up huge number of viewers, just like a big network company. 

Gameplay : 
- As mentioned before, this is mostly an optimisation game. You want to rack up viewership and the key is to know when to discard aging shows. This mechanism works really well. Discarded shows go into the rerun section of your board and actors and ads that were associated to the show are discarded. 
- There isn't a whole lot of player interaction. You don't need to be hugely concerned with what other players are doing with their shows / actors. You can still screw over the other players by taking shows that would otherwise give them genre bonuses but most of the time to your own detriment. 
- That said, the choices you have each turn are really interesting. Should you take that really neat network card, or that show that will give you a genre bonus? Should you drop out early and take the cash / viewer bonus? Lot's of fascinating choices. 
- Network cards really add a different aspect to the game. Some are a little over powered I think (the end game scoring ones), but it's MOSTLY never an obvious choice to take a network card over another card. 
- Having the lowest points in the early rounds can prove to be beneficial as the lowest scoring playing gets to go first, potentially snagging a really good network card, or getting the genre bonus from an available show. 
- Money is crucial. Dropping out early can make a big difference as you won't have to rely on taking that many ads in the next turn. Also means that you can afford those expensive sport shows. Having little money is always a disadvantage (I think)
- Game time is around an hour and a half. Setting up is fairly straightforward. Took ard 2 hours to play on our first play through but we blazed through the second play. 
- Rulebook was very well written. But is a little too big for the box though. The edges were a little squashed due to this. 

Cons: 
- Didn't care much for the scoring track on the player board. None of us actually used it during the game. 
- Can't think of any other negatives (for now). 

Overall: 
Brilliant game! When we finished the first game, I think the general disposition was that of satisfaction. To rack up viewers and succeed in your mini plans is a very satisfying endeavour. Even those who lost thoroughly enjoyed themselves. We definitely will get this to the table more often. Highly satisfying!

Love the theme, which is integrated -fairly- well. Love the art. And the game itself is pretty teachable, and with few corner cases. And it moves pretty quickly.

While I didn't hate my play of The Networks, something nagged me about the game, which took me about a week to figure out. The problem is that shows you acquire have completely deterministic and fixed viewers (i.e. victory points), except for matching the show to the 'right' time slot in the first year (i.e. round) (which, granted, since the game runs only 5 years, is actually quite important). Why is this a problem?

1. NO RISK: Very unthematic when compared to real television shows.

2. NO INTERACTION/COMPETITION POST DRAFT: Also unthematic. All the shows live in their own bubble, without any reference to what other shows in the genre or time slot in the game. There's no sense that the is a common audience that we can all going after.

I think this is to reduce playtime, but still, disappointing.

3. NO SOLITAIRE PUZZLE: The real kicker. While I enjoy games like Glass Road and Isle of Skye, which are arguably a competitive mini-game (role selection and the tile drafting and selling rounds respectively) and a solo spatial puzzle pasted on , they are vastly superior for reasons. First, their competitive mini-games are more interesting than simple drafting drafting. More importantly, The Networks has no puzzle to solve. You just plop the right shows in the right slot with right ads and actors and your done. Since there is no risk you can do whatever as long as you meet the requirements, and since there is no competition with anybody else you don't can about what others are doing after the draft.

Thus turning the game into a boring game mostly about drafting the best combos at the right time, which found boring.

Solid game. It's fun to play but more like once in a while. Is pretty good solo experience but would say it's best with 3. 
Production quality is good but there is a downside as the game board(s) seem to be not primed well enough. I have a bit of colour loss on the board (black and grey) due to this and can already see that the boards will look pretty ugly on just 12 months.

RATING: 4
This game is not fun. It's multiplayer solitaire (except for drafting order) where the actions you take aren't interesting. Biggest problem: Pink "Network" cards aren't balanced. One card might give you 3 VP, or another could be easily used to get ~20 VP.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The Networks is a light-medium drafting game with an immersive theme, a well thought sense of humour and solid design.

The game lasts five "seasons", and the players are TV owners trying to lure the audience to watch their channels, developing every kind of weird TV show.

Most of the game makes thematic sense (except the lack of competition for spectators: everyone could potentially grow his/her audience at the same time, without any kind of "stealing").

The art is quite cheap, but it solidly conveys the theme. The graphic design is good enough to deliver information. The production value is not stellar, but decent enough.

Everything considered, The Networks is a quite good game, and I will keep an eye at the designer and publisher, waiting for their next project...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The networks is a easy game with a good integrated theme. The game is in the first place a combination game and I have the feeling that it is tested very well. Some of of network cards have a different comment when played later in the game , which gives a feeling that the game really developed during playing. Although the artwork is very structural and clear, I must admit I don't like the graphics. But besides that the Networks is a strategic game that also can be played with  occasional players.

Greatly enjoy the theme and humour. Mechanic is simple card drafting, however as cards have different value to each player, you should take this into account when deciding what to take now and what can hopefully wait. Yet to play the interactive, advanced or expansion yet, so plenty of room for rating to move.

from my experience:
the game feels like it's one season too long, also the fact that the last player can just scoop up everything that's left kinda screws the turn duration balance between players and makes it annoying for the others to wait. the chain effects of reaching 3 or 5 shows of the same genre does the same. interaction is basically zero, the game mostly exists because of the humor of the show-cards

This game presents a uniquely challenging economic puzzle as you develop shows for your network, cast them, and choose ads to run alongside them. You must also make the decision of when to syndicate shows and send them into reruns, and when to end your season and draw up your budget. These tricky sounding things are distilled to simple to understand actions, but the strategic depth of your choice of show, star, and everything else is not diminished. Not to mention the cards are very funny.

The Networks is a card game of picking up shows for your TV station and adding stars to the cast while raising money through advertising. The game is well put-together, albeit fiddly. There are clever ways that the cards are used, such as flipping them when certain requirements aren't met so they become less valuable. There are sets of cards for shows and for ads and for stars and network cards that give special bonuses. Each player has their own small board with slots for an 8PM, 9PM and 10PM show. Players take actions in order, picking up cards for what they need and the earlier to pass earns more money in that round.

The theme of the game is very well integrated and the titles of shows, stars and ads on the cards are very clever and fun. That part may wear off and I do think replayability is questionable in the long term. With 4 players, I think this could be a really good game to play several times.  I've only played it with 2 players which was okay, but probably not the best number and I'd like to give it a try with 4.

Sept 2016 - Enjoyed this one.  It's really a card game but it's very thematic with the titles, the mechanics on what you are doing, etc.  Easy to play but tough choices and some nice look ahead...are you planning on replacing a show in a couple of seasons when you know it is starting to fade then, etc.  My play was with two and planing again with five now which I imagine will make it tougher to get what you are looking for, the time slots to fill, etc.  

And heck, MOO TV!  It is the color I want, my favorite cat's name, AND has Wide World of Forks as a starting show.  :)

Boy, do I dislike the artwork. Yes, it fits the humor perfectly and I love the humor of the game. But the artwork is somehow too goofy. I'd wish for a somehow more ... serious one? I don't know. Stop asking me!
I just dislike the artwork.

But I ordered the game despite the artwork which turned the Kickstarter down for me. After I saw a few reviews I was interested and preordered it.

Great game. Super fun. Nice and simple mechanics.

This game's theme is great, and you really feel like you're trying to juggle a late night schedule, trying to keep your viewership and cash flow up in the process.

You start the game with hilariously bad shows, such as "Let's Pickle", and you'll build up your network from there, firing up some much more compelling shows, filling them with actors and actresses to bring in more viewers, and getting advertisers to bring in some cash.

Every show has a life cycle, so you'll be constantly trying to time the introduction of new shows to replace your aging ones, earning a few extra viewers for re-runs of the replaced shows in the process. However, you're of course competing against several other networks, so some times they'll beat you to something good.  Additionally, shows usually require you have some combination of star talent and/or ad contracts on hand to even draft them, and every show performs better in a certain time slot than others, so there's a lot to consider to make sure you're prepared for that perfect show for your network should it pop up. This introduces great tension, as you need to prioritize what you really need, and what you can wait on, risking it getting taken up by a rival network.

Overall, just really good stuff. A rare example of a game where I really feel like the mechanics and theme are interwoven.

Solo play: nice and relatively simple and quick. About 40 mins to complete a solo game. Random shows etc. means you need to develop your strategy on the fly. That said, Network cards that increase viewers are critical. That said, there needs to be a balancing act between how much cash or viewers to collect at every Drop and budget action. It's like a worker placement game without the workers ;)

Pros :
- Very thematic with an excellent art style.  Extremely charming. 
- Lots of humour and pop culture references.
- Quick turns, not much waiting between seasons.
- Card rotation is a neat addition to the game.
- Included solo-mode is always a bonus.

Neutral Considerations :
- Fairly straight forward, don't expect any brain busters here.
- Takes up a fair amount of table space. 
- Sleeving the cards makes the box a tight squeeze.

Cons :
- Fairly straight forward, don't expect any brain busters here. (I like em' complex)
- 5 (or even 4?) would make seeing the card offering hard.
- Could see it wearing out it's welcome after a few games, could be given more life with the new KS expansion.

A bit long with the full 5. But I'm not a huge fan of how cards are removed with fewer than 5. You're screwed if the cards for the genres you're going for don't come up. Clever system overall, and highly thematic (for a card-driven Euro).

Seems like things are well balanced.  It does not over stay its welcome.  Has a good 2 player variant.  It's only a slight variant and plays well.  The shows and actors are funny but some are a miss for me.  The network card (pink) are visually dull and needs some art.

Solid card-drafting game, with the pleasant necessity of laying tentative plans for an uncertain future. Player interaction is entirely of the "you took what I wanted" variety, which will appeal to some folks and not to others. (There are some higher-interactivity action cards included, but I haven't yet played with them.)

The humor on the cards is wonderful, and sometimes biting.

The game feels like it has no real choices, there seems to be one best choice every turn, and if you deviate from that, you are going to lose. It is also possible for a player to be completely out of the game if you make one bad choice during the 1st season (or if you are just the poor sap who only gets one show during season 1). 

Also, the jokes on the cards just fell flat for me.

A fiddly fairly average Euro saved only by a decent thematic overlay

To give context: I am a Eurogamer. [thing=72321][/thing] has been heralded as an accessible Eurogame whilst having the strong theme and context of an Ameritrash, but maintaining a thoughtful simple Euro mechanic.  I disagree.  Yes the game has a great accessible theme where you make programmes which, on first play, are amusing (though on subsequent plays this humour surely wears thin).  But the game mechanic is not simple enough for most families, being fairly fiddly and unintuitive, whilst it isn‚Äôt particularly deep and engaging for a heavier Eurogamer. 
 
The success of this game in the US tells me that accessible theme is important; perhaps Eurogame publishers and designers should take heed of The Networks by looking at the real world for thematic inspiration rather than always defaulting to Science Fiction, Fantasy, Cthulhu or History.

An excellent light-to-medium weight resource management game with a unique, lighthearted theme.  Players, as network executives, must decide between greenlighting shows like "Doctor What" and "Quiver," and hiring stars such as "The Guy That Dies In Everything" and "The Celebrity Chef," while trying to accumulate the highest viewership. I was taught the game at The Uncommons by designer Gil Hova.

The theme does the game a great service, but if someone pulls away early on it seems difficult for other players to catch up. Even when you draft cards before the lead player there are too many good options that you don't feel you're impacting that first player enough, or helping yourself enough, to close the gap.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
I enjoyed this one and it has a very unique theme and the mechanics do convey the theme, however I do wonder if it will date quickly?
The card art and the puns on TV shows names are amusing at first but will we even recollect what they reference in 5 years time? Not that I think I will even be playing this is 5 years time. 
It has a good few plays in it but after that I am not sure how much strategy and variation there actually is in this really rather multiplayer solitaire card drafting-set collection game 
I think it will offer a different game play experience at 3 players than the full 5 which we played and I will certainly try it at lower player counts. I am just not as enthusiastic about game play as I expected to be. 
Cardstock is very poor for the price payed for this and actually I don't think I like the art style.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I agree with another in my game group that this is a 'filler-plus'.  It is over in a little over an hour.  Played twice with 3 which I like.

I would start with the Network cards out from the very beginning, and possibly let everyone start with a network card, last player picks first, and then deal out a new set for the 1st season.

In my 2017 Gaming Hoopla play, one player had a poor first season, and was behind until the very end when he was able to jump from 3rd to 2nd.

With my group, I would potentially take out the interactive cards as we're not as 'take that' as others.  There aren't enough Interactive cards for everyone to really get a chance at harming others.

After seeing the upcoming expansion, it looks like that is the best way to play, as this game, while enjoyable, could get old fast since you're seeing the same shows that essentially do the same things over and over.

Donated to Gaming Hoopla library.

A fun little card allocation game. So far, I have only played it at 2 players. While, it worked at 2, I just dont think its optimal at 2. The turns were lighting fast, almost to the point of it being too fast. No time to really let things sink in. I also found this to be a tad on the fiddly side. The 2 player turn order track was quite annoying. Despite its minor flaws, I really enjoyed this. The theme was unique and fun, the artwork was charming at cute, the components were of high quality. I think the next time this hits the table, I will have more fun with it. I think it would be awesome to really sink your teeth into the theme, talk about your shows just try to be a little more leisurely with it. I think 3-4 players will be optimal for this. Cant wait to play again.

Fun set collection game. It's nothing new, but it is very charming, and the humor / pop culture references make it a fun, enjoyable experience with casual and regular gamers alike. My biggest gripe is that the cards are set up oriented in one direction (like many other games), but the text that provides specific and important information require that you pick up each card to read them. This creates some difficulty for people sitting sideways or upside down from the cards--basically, either the game bogs down because everyone has to look at the cards closely, or the people who don't get to see the cards easily will just have to deal and perhaps deal with a disadvantage.

These cards change constantly, which means people have to look at these cards each round, slowing down gameplay.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun & simple tableau builder. Despite the appearance, it is very easy to pick up & play. The theme makes it enjoyable and sensible as far as how the cards are layed out, with some amusing references to real TV shows. This could get a bit old if played a lot. The game could use more expansions (new cards to freshen things up).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This game is addicting!  I discovered it at Origins this year (2016) and I immediately wanted to play it again.

Maybe it's because I had just finished a rather heavy euro about competing art galleries that took 4 hours where I came in second, but immediately upon playing this game the weight and length felt just right, like the Porridge in the middle between too heavy and too light (often used to describe Porridge).

The best thing about this game is every action is so addictivly  satisfying, it really is fun to play even if you lose, which is so important in a euro.

Everyone I play with loves the theme - the humor is best the first time you see each card, but the charm of the game as a whole stays fresh.  It looks good, but under the hood, the game just works!  

I might raise my rating later, depending on the meta-game and what strategies develop - I am excited to discover how dynamic might be (time will tell)

I got to play this with the designer (Gil) at FALCON 2014.  It was just a prototype with no final artwork.  I'm sure there can be changes as the game continues to develop, but I feel like it is a very strong game with the rule set we played with.  An excellent economic game that almost anyone can relate to.  You are an executive making decisions on what shows to put in three available time slots.  There are different actors and ads you can have go along with your shows in order to gain income or viewership.  With the time moving element (shows lose viewership as they age) it forces you to plan out ahead and be aware of where everyone is on their shows time track.  Great game!  Probably one of the top games I played this year.  Really looking forward to the final development and eventual release.

Components: good quality
Complex: not hard to learn and teach
Weight: medium
Players: 4
Length: around 90 mins
Mechanics: set collection is the main one
Decisions: enough to have fun
Opinion: you try to manage your local TV setting a good plan in the prime time hours, so you have 3 slots at 8, 9 and 10 and you have to select the best shows.
First of all, the text in the cards is really funny, all of them refers to some TV series or some actor/actress.
Then about the gameplay, it is not a hard game, but one to play once in a while. Enough decisions and tense play while having lot of fun with the cards.
Played during 5 seasons, you have to select cards from a row or put them on your TV. You have shows, actors, ads and specials. Each show requires or can have, depending on which one, some type of actors or ads. Depending on your decision you will score and/or earn money.
Once the season ends, the age of the show changes what it gives, it could give more points on the second season or not, the actors could do it worse later...
Then you have some special cards than can help you with your shows, like doing a show with an actor not required, or ignoring the preferences of the actor.
In a nutshell, is a fast game with lot of fun, and with decision to be made throughout the game. In the end you will have a story to tell about your local TV and see if you have done well

Not sure why this one fell flat for me, but it did. I don't particularly care for the art style and while the cards had very funny titles associated with them, I think that would get old after just a couple plays limiting replayability. Furthermore, this game has a mechanic that I typically despise in games, which is the presence of swingy modifier (network) cards. I just don't really like games where you have to keep picking up cards and reading the details before you make a decision and where one card can swing a bunch of points each round (or allow you to steal an opponent's green room star). Thankfully, in this game there are only a few of those cards that come out every round and I'm sure that over time you will learn what every one of those cards does, but at the same time, the game didn't do enough for me to actually invest the time to find out.

The Networks is a very clever drafting game about managing a television network. A wonderful use of theme has you buying the rights for shows, cast stars and get ads for them. As the shows age they generally bring you less viewers, but you can always replace them with newer, fancier shows. The goal is to get the most viewers by the end of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
It took a few rounds to get in the swing of things, but by the end of the game we were hustling our ad revenue, dealing career ending blows to stars for slightly increased viewer numbers, and ruthlessly chopping shows still in their prime in order to take advantage of well-timed network cards.

We found we could go deep strategy or light, and wound up not fully understanding some of the cards in our first play but feeling like we didn't miss out by choosing to not utilize certain aspects in the game.

The boards and cards have a great balance of utility information and artwork, and we were able to cut back on our use of the rule book because the design breeds familiarity and ease.

The game wound up being neck and neck the entire time, with the winner only managing a two point win. Lots of fun and lots of amusement when announcing our new shows on our networks each turn!

Just a couple plays, but I would say the game really suffers from a lack of variety. What it needs more than anything is just more shows, and more stars. But the gameplay is simple, and it is a really nice, thematic engine building/maintenance game where you're trying to outmaneuver your opponents. Game is a little more cerebral than I would have expected, but more than lite enough to take it all in good humor.

The Networks was my first full board game that I backed on Kickstarter. The theme sounded unique, and I thought it might be something that my wife would enjoy. While it didn't go over with my family as well as I'd hoped, I've found this to be a solid game that I enjoy every time I get it to the table. Concerns about the short shelf-life of the game's TV show parodies are justified, though... after the first two plays they're just present, but still fun for new players. I find the game to be a good medium-weight game for an hour's play time.

A mid-weight, mid-to-high interest game. (I wish I could understand all of the movies/actors references!)
The "what will I get first because you'll take what I don't" aspect of the game is interesting (kind of a race but with a little less once-sided aspect). Scheduling shows offers a few choices (optimal spot or not? Replace it this turnor not?)
Money is very short, which is what makes decisions interesting.
Still, it feels like an easy-going game.

Aug16:

It was cute, and I'm glad I got to play it, but that is enough.

The theme carried a lot of the weight.  Beyond that, it was a solid card drafting game.  Wasn't much in the way of combos, mostly just steady point accumulation.

But the theme was really good and the game play wasn't actually bad in any way...

Really great theming and a true crowd pleaser. Quick to teach and get into playing. For my tastes there is not sufficient strategic depth to stay interesting - it's too easy to calculate optimum plays with little long-term strategizing. Network cards can be swingy in their power, compounding the luck factor. Fun for a few games, but right now I feel cursed that its the game in my closet that people who haven't tried always want to play.

I've played games where it felt like the other players were there for socializing while we all played our solitaire. The Networks was like that in some respects, but mostly improved on that feeling thanks to some of the (Network) decision cards and the timing of when you make certain moves being so important. Compared to Prime Time, another newer game in this space, The Networks had a more inviting scoring system & design. That said, like all TV programming games thus far, this felt like it was missing something. I understand the shows bleeding viewers as they age, but the fact there was no "hit" show that sustained beyond 3 good seasons was antithetical to the theme. What about a Big Bang Theory-type show that carries on for years? The dwindling returns made it a better game, no doubt, but not a good TV simulator. No game has yet captured the idea of building a network that has your personality on it. Do you want to build a block of sitcoms like Must See TV? Do you double down on reality & sports? (Etc.) Also, while having custom boards for your desired number of players was nice, I wanted the scoring track to lock together. Between that and the cubes being so easily jostled, there was a lot on the table I had to handle gingerly. I'd play it again, but with 5 people (all learning, I'll grant you) it took a little over 2 hours. I'd have to be in a certain mindset.

This game felt pretty generic to me, and way too simple. The pink cards which give powers or endgame scoring should spice things up a bit but they're pretty boring too. The one decent seeming thing is the bonus for shows of the same genre, but I think it's too little to save the game. The major problem is that everything is just either worth points or money in a really straightforward way. The shows get points and cost money at varying rates, and some can hold stars and/or ads. Stars also just get points and maybe cost money, and ads just bring in money.

This game could be great however; the names of the shows, as well as their genres and time slots are recognizable to TV viewers and therefore add some entertainment to the game in reading the cards. But they mostly missed a huge opportunity to make both the theme and the gameplay be more engaging by penalizing you for combos that don't make sense. For example, the Shakespearean actor brings in the same number of viewers if you attach him to a serious drama show as he does on a reality show about explosions. And the penalty for putting a show on in the wrong timeslot is often very small. Some, but not enough of the cards do have these kinds of effects. A lot of ads pay less for example if they're not on at certain times (this one's a bit weak but at least it's something). The ad 'promo' can also bring in viewers if you pay the cost of the ad when you slot it into a show which is a nice touch but there are too few things like this.

Overall I'd summarize it as a game where you're drafting cards from a central pool and most of the cards just say either 'gain X dollars' or 'pay Y dollars to get Z points.' Not enugh interesting stuff thematically or mechanically.

Blind playtested a prototype version at Metatopia 2015. Pretty fun, but probably not my style of game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Blends TV Wars and Traumfabrik with a sprinkle of Vegas Showdown. First three seasons play well as you try to plan out your three shows for maximum viewer (points) gains. Typically a show has staying power for the first 3 seasons, but they can vary over the course of 5 seasons (the length of the game). Some start off with a bang and drop off rapidly, others take awhile to build up a loyal following. Actors get attached to boost viewership as well as ads that boost income to help pay for the possible upkeep of the show and actors (if applicable).

It doesn't have that push your luck tension that a Traumfabrik has where you have to weigh completing a movie with max slots for massive value, or just shove it out the door to get credit for it and move on to the next movie. Or gamble that the right tiles will be out in the final quarter to fit into your movies that you took a leap on. This is because you can load up the green room with as many actors, shows, and ads that can be deployed to a show when the show is purchased. There is no penalty for keeping them in the green room, whereas shows that you broadcast and their attached actors tend to have upkeep costs. Each show usually requires an actor or an ad, or both. Some don't require either and are fine as they are (ensemble cast?). But you usually want to pair them up with an actor (more viewer/points) and ads (revenue).

The game flows fine up until the third season, I would say. In the fourth and fifth seasons, your well laid out network of shows may randomly get flushed with some other shows, even if the existing shows are very good. This is because the game rewards sets of 3 and 5 of the same type of genre. There is also a double scoring phase at the end of the game (one for end of round as usual, and then one more). To put it in perspective, after each season, your show shifts down to the next level. The fourth and fifth tiers of a show tend to be dreadful. You almost never want to let it go that low since there are 1's there and that will tank your game.

Since season 4/5 TV shows have much higher starting viewer stats, it behooves you to dump decent shows to plug them in, even without a good actor, in order to get the 3/5 matching genre bonuses. So the final couple of rounds has you shifting shows in and out in a flurry for no good reason other than to try and make matching sets. The 5 of a kind reward gets you points + dump cash for even more points. Thematically, this just doesn't feel right. But I guess it reminds me of one of those "4th" networks that are in perpetual turmoil as execs desperately try to plug in shows to try and stay afloat.

The problems compound when the genre of show you want doesn't show up in the final round to make the 3/5 set match. But it does for other players. Or, you wind up going last because you happen to have a slight lead (which is how turn order is determined). There's no way to switch around turn around unless maybe there is a card that does it. Since a ton of points are scored at game end (via the extra score and the bonus cards), it doesn't appear advantageous to build an early lead as much as you would think, since you will get last in turn order and a critical show or bonus card will probably be gone.

On top of that, there are special cards you can select instead of shows, actors, or ads. They break the rules or allow you to score more points. These seemed very imbalanced as some where kind of useless and others scored huge points.

I like what the game is doing and would try it again, but just keep in mind that this is  more of a free wheeling, lighter game and don't take it too seriously. The cards are fun to read, too, and add into the wacky chaos that is The Networks.

Component quality is good and it plays good. Building synergy withing your network is amazing. Hoping for an expansion that adds more seasons to the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Timing is decisive. Being at the right place in turn order to snatch one more new show or an important network card will make the difference. Staying close behind in VPs to be earlier in turn order is a strong strategy. The consequences of a bad positioning can be severe, e.g. in a three-player game only five new shows are available each turn. This aside, the game is rather shallow but entertaining. Somehow, The Networks pulls the feat of shifting  players' perceptions. Not until the end, I associated viewers with victory points.
---
The theme and the artwork are appealing. Gameplay seems to be straightforward although the poor explanation at Spiel 2017 leaves some uncertainty on this issue. My one question after a couple of turns of the game is if there are enough meaningful decisions and possibilities for moves granting an advantage. The basic action of selecting one card is so basic that I have doubts on the longevity which would be a pity.

This is an interestingly themed game, about TV shows and advertisements. Its a shame that the objective had nothing to do with making money, and instead was about viewers (i.e. you could be extremely profitable, but not win the game). The game is too procedural for my liking, but for an indie, its pretty good.

Also a shame that the Stars didn't have much personality. It would've been nice to try to fight for Stars in your shows.

Got to play a prototype this weekend. 
Pros: Really excellent humor - flavor text is great, we were cracking up at the great titles of the shows. 
I liked that there were conditions for taking advantage of the best qualities of stars and ads. 
It seemed to play pretty smoothly with two people neck in neck the entire game. 
Cons: very fiddly upkeep between rounds, and some AP caused by having to evaluate all available options at the beginning of each round.
Too light for my tastes.  
I really don't care for the style of the artwork if it is similar to what is on the box. It could be humorous, but doesn't help me feel the theme at all.

Late backer on this and played a 3 player game. The cards themselves have amusing names. The gameplay itself is rather strategic, more so than you might think. You basically have a certain amount of money to spend on stars, shows and ads, once your are either out of money or don't want to spend anymore your turn ends. You then place stars in your greenroom, and shows right into your timeslots. Really interesting stuff and a game I'm happy to have and can see playing many times.

* note have played many more times and the game keeps getting better...just needs MORE shows and stars!!!

A very interesting concept for a game. I really enjoy the struggle of knowing when to sit tight on a shot and when to send it to reruns.

Maybe the best integration of theme into gameplay I've experienced. The actions and rules just make sense in terms of theme. Love the parody shows and the cartoon-y artwork. It's basically a Euro game with theme. However, I just wish there was more. After two plays, I've seen most (if not all) of the shows so far. Not sure how it would scale to higher player counts but it was really fun at two. It's a great, clean, simple engine builder that is a good bridge between light and medium games.

RATING: 6
There are some nifty timing aspects of when you should retire which shows, and also depending on what your opponents value what to draft first. However, this game had very strange and unthematic methods of converting excess money to points: a straight conversion under certain conditions, or retiring cheap shows at a fast rate, possibly even before they have aired a season, just so you can use them for set collecton purposes.

I am also worried about replayability, as while the different tv show, advertisements, and actor names are novel, many of them are functionally similar, and while the special cards can change from game to game they are not as much the heart of the game.

Overall, it is a solid game and there aren't many games of its theme, but it is mechanically kind of bland.

Surprised to see this not higher than it was.  This has to be one of the highest rated board games that I've brought to my Wednesday night group.  We had a wide variety of players from the very seasoned to the novices and everyone loved it.
There was a lot of concern about the rules being a bit confusing and it seemed to have a steep learning curve at first, but I think with a slightly better & updated explanation video, the game would be even more accessible to newer players.  Once I rephrased things for my more novice players, they picked it up fairly quickly after that.
Everyone agreed that while the game went about 2 1/2 hours with 5 players instead of the stated 90, by turn 2 the game started picking up considerably and would be much closer to the stated time for the next play.
Will be bringing this one to the table again frequently.

RATING: 7
As a TV exec, this game particularly intrigued me when I first heard about it on Kickstarter.  There have been a number of attempts in the past (Prime Time, TV Wars, War of the Networks) to try to capture the "programming TV" theme in a game element with varying levels of success.  This is one of the better efforts providing a rich experience, a nice amount of whimsy, and an accessible game and scoring engine.

Gil Hova has come up with a game that overcomes the rigidity of War of Networks, the convoluted scoring of TV Wars, and the cumbersomeness of Prime Time.   There is a nice logic that makes sense and fits in with the theme of programming television.  How shows are programmed and how you help boost their viewership and income with the stars and ads fit together really well.   

Kudos for the design of the cards and rules.  Information and the rules book are laid out clearly - especially appreciated the layout of the viewership numbers.  Makes it very to easily calculate star bonuses.  It's also very convenient when sizing up what shows are stronger than others.  

That being said, this is a good game that is just a few steps away from being great.  Was hoping for a little more interactivity.  Yes, there are some Network cards that help feed that need, but it was a few and far between.  I would have loved more elements where you feel like you‚Äôre not just developing in a vacuum.

I would have especially liked something that rewards you for having the best show within a timeslot in a given season.  The game could use some mini-victory moments before the final tally.  The game has a nice steady pace...but it could have used some more peaks and valleys to infuse some extra energy into the proceedings.

I appreciate the number of choices laid out in the game, but they could be overwhelming.  (FYI, make sure you‚Äôre table has a lot of space because there‚Äôs a lot laid out here!) Not sure how you can get around this, but it caused the game to stall as some players took a lot of time to make decisions based on what was around the board.  Speaking of choices, it would be nice to have some hidden information so everything is not out in the open.  Again, this could lead to some nice mini-victory reveals which we found lacking in the game.

Lastly, the physical design is another facet that's good, but just shy of being great.   I personally like the artwork and the plays on show titles.  It gave the game a bit of playfulness without seem cloying.  However, I wish there was some better way to keep the scoring track together.  Sometimes the slightest moves on the table would misalign things.  This also would happen with the cubes tracking the age of the show. 

Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase and look forward to playing again and hope that future expansions and variants address some of the things I was missing from this.  The great thing is that it‚Äôs sparked some ideas on gameplay variants (which I‚Äôll share in a separate forum post) that could solve some of the issues I had mentioned without totally disrupting solid foundation that‚Äôs been built.

Really casual, breezy action selection temporary synergies game.  Probably runs one or two rounds too many.  No player interaction to speak of.  Network cards aren't really balanced and there's an annoying lack of freedom in how to deal with old shows.  The decisions are not quite brainless but are sub-interesting; mainly they just involve considering turn order.

Not bad, but runs long for what it is. Games like this that are the same every round and don't build to a crescendo should play in 45-60 minutes. This one feels a round too long.

Thematically well done. Some fun: starting a show which has a preferred time slot, acquiring stars that provide you with viewers, acquire adds etc. Then when after a couple of seasons a show ages and gets less viewers, you put it away to the re-runs where it still scores a couple of viewers for you. There is some set collection too. All in all a nice medium game of puzzling and timing, smooth playing. Nothing new, but theme well implemented with well known mechanisms.

Very good game!
I think that it's less complicated than it looks and that the artwork is one of the best I've ever seen in board games, for the parody purposes it was needed!
I'd definitely recommend it to others!

Only played once, but I would not recommend it as a two-player experience unless you're looking for a very light and very loose game. It could be cute and funny in that case, but otherwise, stick to higher player counts.

Amusing cards, okay gameplay.  Having only three time slots means that banishing shows to reruns before they ever score is probably optimal.   Money is somewhat of a push-your-luck mechanic.  You need to get a set of 5 near the end of game to turn money into VP.  However, there is no guarantee that you will see a show of the right genre in the last round so artificial delay risks more stars than you are likely to gain by spending excess cash.  Getting a set of 5 earlier means you need to estimate your cash needs for later rounds.

Cards were generally good quality, seemingly with a faux linen look.  Somehow the pink (Network) cards looked to be worse quality and completely failed on aesthetics.  Cardboard punched very poorly; be careful so that you don't end up tearing off the top layer.

RATING: 8
A cool tableau-building game. Very good basic mechanisms and set collection.
The biggest concern I have is with replayability. The game should be fine, but it will likely feel a bit samey as there aren't really too many different gameplay mechanisms in the core cards, and really the only difference is those pink event cards.

The other issue is that you use most cards each game, with the exception of the event cards once again.

Really great 2-player rules.

I think this is a good game for people that like Ted Alspach's games.  Theme is really good.  I think that replay-ability is good not great.   It makes me laugh the same way munchkin does but unlike munchkin I like to play the game more than once.

A fun game about running a network channel. The first round feels scripted, and so does the rest of the game to an extent, but overall it's a fun  game with a ton of points / viewers to be obtained. A bit of a point salad in that way...

A positive initial impression. The rulebook is good, it really supports learning on the fly like few games do. The game is funny and the game mechanisms interesting. The two-player game is quite good. However, after less than ten games, I'm already starting to feel bored.

Indifferent.

Beautiful artwork and funny text, and it is quite enjoyable being Moses Znaimer and parlaying your crappy little TV station (with shows about breathmints and forks, featuring washed-up stars) into a broadcasting behemoth. Not innovative in its mechanics (which are a bit like a simplified version of Imperial Settlers), so your enjoyment of the game will depend to a great extent on how much you are into the theme and artwork. Overlong given its middling weight and the fact that it's easy for a clear winner and/or loser to emerge early on.

This game of maximising programmes on your TV networks works really well and contains ideas that mesh well together (e.g. the ageing of the shows).
I need to play this gain as I would like to take more time to enjoy the humour of each card.

RATING: 8
Fun (and funny) game. The idea of helping a struggling TV station is a cool one, and the humor in this game is some that I could actually see being funny on repeated plays. I do wish that there was a bit more variety with the various TV shows, but unless you're playing with a full compliment, you probably won't see all of them from game to game.

Mechanically, this is a very basic tableau management game. Everything about it is super thematic, which really helps to keep you invested in the game. This is a game that I think the theme will be enough to charm hardcore gamers, but the rules are light enough that non-gamers could probably hold their own.

Unlike a lot of other Kickstarter Euros, this game does a good job of giving you different avenues to pursue. You aren't railroaded down a particular path, nor are points handed out in such a way that the scoring at the end of the game feels arbitrarily close. There's even a decent sense of progression that some professional designers still don't know how to do correctly.

So why don't I rate the game higher? Well, I do think the depth of this game is fairly shallow for what I would like in a Euro game these days. The ease of play definitely fits with the audience this game is going for, but it lacks a certain creativity on the part of the player. It's just plugging in different things to generate money and views (points). I like this game quite a bit for how well it captures its theme. I won't ever call it a great design, but it's very appealing nature makes it one I want to bring to the table again.

We all watch TV!  (Well most of us anyway...)  My wife and I certainly do.  This game teaches what it is like to run a TV network, including stars, shows, budgets, ads, multiple seasons, re-runs and other important aspects.  I really like economic/business games and this game took me by surprise at how well it captures the feel of running a TV network.  Very close competition with terrific euro-ish mechanisms and very fun to play with lots of laughs (thus the higher rating).  Can't wait to get a copy and play with my wife.  I hope the final artwork is well done as we played a prototype with Gil the designer,

Played this at DTC 2016.  I enjoyed the game play alright, but it did not live up to my expectations or excitement around the theme.  I cannot place my finger on it now, but it was just ok for me.  Still looking for a good game about producing TV after this fell short and I was scared away from Prime Time.

Very simple to play game with a nice level of humour to it (albeit a little Americanised)

Enjoyed the Network cards providing a little bit of "take that" action, but not too much. Doesn't seem to be a great deal of a puzzle to work out, and your strategy does have to flow with the dealing of the cards. Especially if you want to replace a 10pm show and there aren't any available.

RATING: 7
I've wanted to play this for a long time, mostly because of the theme. It is essentially an open drafting game. I enjoyed it quite a bit, but probably would prefer it with 3 or 4 players rather than 5 players. The art is not good at all, in my opinion, but there are laughs to be had from the names of shows and stars.

RATING: 7.5
UHF: The Board Game is a light-hearted, tongue in cheek take on TV and a solid mid-weight Euro.  You'll need to pace yourself as you develop the shows you need to score in the late game.  So far, it's done a great job in converting non-gamers...

Love to play this game, when I can get others to play it.  The artwork has a very unique style and look and the pieces are all good quality.  Where this falls down is that there isn't really a catchup mechanism.  Every player can just run away with the game beginning on round one.

I didn't have much fun playing this game.  The core mechanics -- gaining ads and stars and developing shows -- were too balanced to be interesting, and then the "Network Cards" give player unacceptably swingy actions or options to throw it all off kilter. Theme broke for me with odd design choices such as a thrown-in set collection element and the head-scratching unimportance of money at the end of the game (other than tie-breaking.)

Interesting timing elements in this game: it's one of those that feels really counter-intuitive at first but is actually carefully tuned underneath. The zany humour is a good and original draw.

Nice theme and funny cards, but gameplay feels very much the same from play to play. It's a tableau-builder : use money to add TV shows to your network, assign stars and gain cards that improve abilities/score points/annoy neighbours. Pass early to get money, otherwise run ads. TV shows age and eventually go to re-runs and then off air  (i.e. their popularity changes over several rounds). It's a good game but fundamentally it is simply a question of efficient drafting. Winning seems to be all about the special cards - there are no different strategies. Happily play again but no need to keep it. Traded away, chain of generosity.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I had heard about The Networks and thought it had a great theme, running your own TV network and programming all the shows on your own station. The theme shines through in this game, most of the shows are parodies of existing TV shows. My favorites are the shows each player starts with, which are all completely original; who wouldn't want to watch [u]Getting to Know your Lower Colon[/u]? In fact I wish more of the shows had original names, the parodies are almost overdone [i](more on this later)[/i]. 

Game play is straight forward, you are programming shows which may require you to have TV stars [i](also some funny parodies to be found)[/i] and/or advertisements. Shows and stars cost money while advertisements will earn you money. There really isn't anything to challenging about the game play, what you see is what you get. I definitely think I would play better my second time around, but after that I think the game would plateau which for a 90+ minute investment is a bit of a let down. 

My biggest gripe with the game are the Network cards, which either offer a special ability [i](some are instant one time effects others are permanent)[/i] or an end game scoring opportunity. There is a stack of these cards and the amount of end game scoring cards you have access to can be quite small. In the 3p game I played I got shut out of those cards and one person had four of them and ran away with it. The scoring opportunities on the cards are run of the mill and undermines the in game scoring of your shows. It's not enough to do really well with your shows if someone has those end game cards. Personally I'd rather not have any end game scoring bonuses or at least make them a separate deck so everyone has equal access to those cards and you can plan for the bonuses accordingly. Wasting an action to take a card that won't score you points so an opponent won't get it never feels good. 

The Networks is a game that benefits greatly by immersing yourself in the theme and having fun with it. However; if you played a bunch of games in a short time frame the jokes are going to get stale quickly. Personally I think it would have been better to mix in more original show names with the parodies. As it stands now The Networks is a game I wouldn't mind playing on occasion so that the humor stays fresh. The game play is good, but not deep enough to engage you over multiple plays. While my write up may seem a bit harsh I had fun playing The Networks,
 but I know I'd burn out on it quickly if I had a copy.
 For now it's one I'd enjoy playing again, but have no desire to own.[/i]

RATING: 8
Swift game of set collection and card drafting with a unique theme and great design. Playing as heads of networks, players develop shows, sign stars, land ads and try to get as many viewers (victory points) at the end of five seasons (rounds). I'm suspicious of any game with cards but full information given to all players, meaning there's no card you can slap down on the table and ruin someone's turn; there's no "Gotcha!" moments. The secret to doing well is simply preempting your opponents and getting to cards faster than they can. The charm of the game is the fantastic and hilarious artwork and names of shows, actors and ads; we spent a fair amount deciphering what was being parodied on the cards. Mad at myself for backing this great game on Kickstarter when I had the chance. Definitely something I would show to newly converted gamers when they wear out on classic Euro themes.

A very nice card game, which sits a little more on the light side of management type games. The humour in the cards is certainly fun and will definitely bring a few laughs when you bring it out to new players. Very, very easy to learn and teach, yet still offers a nice level of thinking. Have played at all player counts and it quite good with any number. Only complaint is that there needs to be about 2 or 3 times the number of cards. I suspect the kickstarter didn't stretch as much as hoped - but what is there is great. Would very much welcome an expansion (or two).

RATING: 6
Based on one play: The theme is fun and the cards are funny so the first time you play there is that aspect of reading all the cards to get a quick laugh. The artwork is not my favorite but you can see the designers like what they do. The game play is standard as you buy cards to put them together and score as many points as possible with combos. The main interaction is taking cards before others, especially to get the right time slot and genre for your show. Otherwise it was not very original.

The Networks is a card-drafting game in which players are trying to acquire television shows that they can air at different times on their TV network.  The point value (# of viewers) of the show can vary by the time slot they're aired, how old their are, and which stars and ads have been placed in them.  Additionally, players can go for shows of various genres--collecting a bunch of the same genre has benefits.  It all comes together for a game in which you have to plan ahead to maximize your viewership, as well as pay attention to what others are doing in order to draft most efficiently.  The theme and art works beautifully in the game, and really adds to its appeal.

Very happy to play this considering I will have the chance to pick it up. I wanted to try it out when I had the chance! I love TV! Love this theme of running my own network and finding the best shows to fill the slots for prime time tv. You are managing all of this and the ads to help give you funding. All while trying to get the most views possible. I really enjoyed this game and wish I had seen the KS for it. Definitely on my wishlist and will be looking to pick this up soon.

RATING: 5.5
A perfectly fine 'super-filler' card game that manages to feel like worker placement, although it's really an all-cards-visible-draft. Most of the decisions felt fairly obvious and there was very little variety in the shows on offer which seemed to score well-best-well-awful, forcing you into a three-season cycle; the stars and ads were much the same. Despite it being 'thematic', I did not like the double-scoring finale; perhaps just another season would have been fine, as the last one was fairly anticlimactic. Decent enough, but not on Series Link.

RATING: 6
This is a somewhat amusingly themed but mechanically dry tableau builder. You are competing with other players for viewers (meaning points) by drafting cards from the center of the table and adding them to one of three slots on your board. When you draft a show card you can also add other cards you've drafted previously that are legal to attach based on the icons below the card. Some degree of flip luck in involved in terms of which types of shows are available each round, which can hurt at times because the game encourages a set collection strategy. Aside from some of the cards from the kickstarter extras being very poorly worded, the game was perfectly fine and enjoyable to play, but there's nothing that makes this game really stand out.

War meine h√∂chste Priorit√§t in Essen 2017- vor Klong und der Scythe Legendary Box! Unverbrauchtes Thema, schicke Grafik und (dank einer fantastischen Lokalisierung) wirklich witzige Karten faszinieren mich auch nach wie vor an diesem Spiel. Leider pl√§tschert das Spiel nur vor sich hin: es gibt zwar Interaktion, aber die taktische Tiefe h√§lt sich wirklich in Grenzen. Keine H√∂hepunkte, keine Spannungskurve. The Networks ist wirklich kein schlechtes Spiel, kann sich in unserer Gruppe aber leider echt nicht durchsetzen.

Played a demo copy at Dexcon 2016. The illustrations are great and the jokes are funny, but they could get old for a while. It doesn't seem like the game is balanced. I was able to take infinite turns to scoop up all of the cards left over at the expense of dropping last, which seems like a minor penalty.

RATING: 7
Action selection game of putting out the best shows out on your network to get max viewership, you can bump up viewership by hiring high profile stars, and also get income from advertisements. The game connects it all quite well, the turn order (based on scoring track) is a bit of a niggle for me as it encourages catchup. But decent artwork and humorous description of TV shows and actors. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The Networks nicely captures it theme of juggling a night time lineup to attract the most viewers. Your bonuses are primarily the preferred time slot multiples of the same genre, stars which cost money to add viewers, ads which provides income. 
The show names are a nice takeoff on familiar names in TVLand. The artwork works with the theme. The rules are not complex even though there are several items to track. 
The game flows smoothly.

It is a nice artifact that the shows have a life cycle. Usually starting strong then tailing off, some more dramatically than others. 

A card draft is how you get your shows to present along with the stars and ads. It is a nice add on that bailing in the round early can net you either more money or bonus viewers.
Most of the competition among the players relates to the card draft. There is scramble for shows, stars to help the shows get more viewers. Ads to make money, special events. Sometimes you may have to prepare your network to make a big hit next season and hope that what you want comes up.

Fine light-middle weight Euro.  The illustration and spoofs make it for me, the game play is fine but lacks much head to head confrontation.  Good for casual-ish gamers.  I would play again just to check out the rest of the deck.

Here's the thing. This is not a bad game. It's on the light side of the euro and it plays smoothly and relatively quickly, but it just doesn't draw me. I'm not a fan of the art, but that isn't it really. It's just that I wouldn't play this unless someone really wanted to at a game meetup. I would pick any number of games I would rather play than this one. I'm telling you to try it, because it is a good game that you might like, but for me it's just nothing special.

This game is very fun, but you really need to dive into the clever card art and names. I'm a little worried that the thrill will wear off once we've gone through the cards a few times. There's not enough cards to keep things new for each game play. With an expansion or two, that can easily be resolved. There's already one slated to come out. I'm hoping it adds cards to the add, star, and show decks along with any other added functionality. This review will need a definite re-visit once I've gotten a few more plays under my belt.

Played once with 5P. Finally, an entertainment-themed game in which the humour clicks with me, by blending satire with the absurd. The game in itself isn't too bad, and I liked the concept of shows losing or gaining viewers as they aged. 

The game runs long for its weight, probably as a consequence of playing this with 5P. It also throws up a lot of information to parse at the start of each round, which is a little disruptive to the game's pacing. Not a game I'd want to play often, but this is actually quite a competent design.

A very good medium-weight game with a fun, accessible theme (and a very clearly written rulebook). I can't wait to introduce this game to some of my non-gamer friends -- I think they'll really enjoy it.

Initial rating of 6.5 is based on a first play with 5 players and inclusion of all the cards, including the 'On the Air' cards. The game seemed too long (for its weight) with 5, and we did not care for the 'On the Air' cards, so that play fell a little flat. However, I expect my rating to rise after further plays.

The Networks is one of those games that doesn‚Äôt really offer anything new or try to utilize a unique mechanism, but it does do it better by offering a really good combination of things that really work well together.  Theme, artwork and game flow work in harmony to set this game apart and offer an engaging game play experience full of tension, decisions and strategy.  The rules are easy to teach and turns are smooth.  I had fun playing and would recommend The Networks to anybody looking for a Euro-style card game that has some depth, but isn‚Äôt overly complex or lengthy.

This is a lovely drafting game, immersive in theme, and well thought out in execution.

Lots of solid decisions to be made. There are quite a few ways to approach the game, and with all the cards and they way they come out, it forces you to constantly evaluate the best way to better your position.

There's a little long with 5 and there's some downtime at the beginning of every season as everyone is evaluating everything. Still, a small price to pay for the design.

Competent, if a little underwhelming card drafting game.  I like the theme a lot, and I liked putting together my lineup of shows.  The card drafting, while not being my favorite mechanism to use, had interesting choices to make throughout the game.  I really disliked the turn order mechanism, and I thought the network cards were fairly uninteresting, though they added to the choices.   

I think we mostly just felt that, other than the theme, it wasn't doing anything new or especially impressive.  I feel like I would have liked it a lot more if I had played it 10 years ago.

Well-designed game that is easy to learn, but it does provide enough decision trees to keep things fun. It helps to pay attention to what your opponents are doing, and perhaps adjust your strategy accordingly.

The end-game double scoring requires some careful planning (because your shows will age before that final scoring).

Dash of humor too, which is always welcome. Still, meh.

tl;dr: one of the better in the genre

So far I've been mostly let down by games in which you have to make movies or television programs. But this is one of the better ones. The rules are clear and clean and the is some nice planning going on.
I must say I enjoyed playing this game.
The publisher is really proud of the graphic design and art. I can see why, it's stylized and has a distinctive style. But I'm not a fan.

Easy game to pick up, theme goes down well with most people. Perhaps too light for some players, but i really enjoy it. I can see this game becoming a bit boring, but expansions will keep it fresh. The fact that it plays solo is a big up for me. Have not played with adv/int network cards

I've now played The Networks with 1,3, 4 & 5 players. I really enjoy how the game mechanics are slightly tweaked based on the number of players, creating a different strategy and gaming experience for each. If you haven't jumped on this bandwagon yet,  its wonderful, richly themed game! Highly recommend it. Overall, Very fun theme, excellent art, and plenty of balanced strategies to use towards winning.

The Networks is a treacherous waste of thematic material.  The cards are cantankerous and crammed with limitations.  Why can't I pack a show with extra ads, or energize an aging series with more stars?  It would be a better game if only for the freedom to play in the network sandbox while learning fewer rules.  It's top-notch creative that deserved a less fussy game.

The unique theme pulled me in on this one and i wasn't disappointed. This is a solid card engine/tableau builder game which might not be to everyone liking, but its right up my street. The game feels polished but does have a lot of information on the cards. My first play was with 5 and it lasted 120 mins which is maybe a little long for this style of game but i think that could come down with multiple plays.

(note: I know the designer, as he used to be the organizer of our game group, and I've played early prototypes of things that became this game.)

Certainly a game that gets the balance between mechanism and theme spot on. It's quite simple to pick up and play, but has enough going on that it shouldn't get stale. The reason is that it really feels like you are playing against the other players and not against the game mechanics. You need to beat them to the punch. To me, this is a longer and more thematic Splendor. The tension of the gameplay felt very similar.

Only one play, with a 4 player count.  This game has a sense of humor, which I love, the theme is something just about everyone can relate to, and the scores were fairly close, perhaps a 25 point gap between first and last place.  It is rather easy, once you get the feel of the mechanics, to count points and figure out exactly where you stand every round.  The bonus cards are okay, the revenue generation is fine.  It's a fun, light game that you could use as a gateway for non gamers, I think.

After all the excitement, we conducted a pole of the 'Remainers' and decided we'd play 'The Networks', where players take on the role of executive producers trying to improve their network (channel) viewing audience figures. You start with ropey programs, and even ropier stars, that those who avidly watched those public information broadcasts and 'On The Buses' in the 1970's will remember, fondly. Your starting income increases according to who is the starting player so the aforementioned has the least as they get to pick from the 'fresh faced' stars and pilot programs they hope will make them the Lew Grade of the modern world. (All praise ATV!) You can also pick up adverts, some specific to certain types of programs (like sports), as well as some free action cards that enable you to improve scheduling times, poach rival channel stars or even add the best audience figures in a particular season and replace them with your poorer watched programs. This procedure continues until either there are no cards to select or every player has 'passed'. The latter term refers to when the player(s) elects to discontinue the action phase and take money or audience figures instead, and the earlier they do this, the higher the rewards. There is a balance to this as well. Scoring is based on the aggregate viewing audience each program (plus any stars and/or adverts) for one of three viewing slots available; 8pm, 9pm (the watershed) and 10pm. You may not always be able to replace shows for a given time slot as the game lasts five seasons whereas most programs last only four. Scoring continues over the lifetime of the show, normally four seasons, or until it heads for the graveyard era of repeats. Lots of them. You do score for these at reduced values. (Another pastime from the 1970's). Bonus audience figures can be gained by acquiring five shows in all genres or 'three of a kind'. This was a tactic I left to late and didn't achieve, respectively. I won't forget next time. A good game that probably could do with a bit more interaction from the participants, particularly if you are from the 1970's, as it will bring back the heady days of three channels and politically incorrect programs (so we are told) like 'Love Thy Neighbour' and 'It Ain't Half Hot Mum!' Good times.

Solid, but basic card-drafting and action selection game. A fun experience, but you never feel like you pull off epic moves. It's a cool theme though, and the game makes thematic sense. It doesn't overstay it's welcome, and a 4 player game takes a little over an hour. Needs some more card variety though, especially more shows and variety in the cards. Will keep an eye out for the upcoming expansion.

The Networks puts on a clinic in regards to stuffing pop culture references and tropes into its television themed game. In a nice change of pace for a game of its ilk, the gameplay doesn't wear out before the jokes do. It's not terribly deep or hard, but there is enough to think about in the economics and card drafting that the game remains interesting after you've stopped paying attention to all of the winks.

On a less tangible level, the game just has a nice feel. It's engaging, even when you appear to be losing because it's still satisfying to put together an amazing run of double-digit viewership for one of your productions. Being a card game, there is quite a bit of randomness at play. Even so, it manages to reward good planning and timely decision-making...Meaning the better player will usually win, regardless of the shuffle.

Again, there's nothing particularly earth-shaking here but it'll be as reliable as a Law and Order spin-off for your collection.

A great little drafting game, unfortunately drafting is one of my favorite mechanics and I already have such a large number of them that it needs to be a little more special to earn a place. 

After a couple plays the shows can feel pretty stale and the game length doesn't seem to warrant the low complexity.

______________________________________________

Take ads to earn money, take network cards for powers, buy stars so they can, in tandem with ads, be used to buy shows.

Combinations of Shows, Stars and some ads increase viewer count for a season. Each passing season changes viewership per show and the 1st season of each show is affected by timeslots.

Get bonus ads/stars for a good channel genre theme (3 or 5 of one colour/genre), choose to drop out early for bonus money/viewers.

End of season, balance show running cost with advert incomes, wipe the board of remaining cards, reset for next season. After season 5, rescore season 5 without making changes. Winner is most viewers after all 5.5 seasons.

Nothing -bad- about The Networks per se. It works. Really well. Its just.. very by the book. Theres little player interaction (other than oh you took one I might want, or limited network cards). So really its not that Networks isnt worth the time, its worth a play if someone brings it to the table. Its just that theres other better games.

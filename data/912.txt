More complicated (or more fiddly) than I would have liked. Rules were pretty bad in the original release but have improved slowly over time. Pretty as she sets up but the campaign game is quite long. Axis & Allies Pacific game is easier to get into and also quite attractive. There's potential for a higher rating with more play and some additional revising of the rules.

One of my favorite of all of Columbia's block games.  It is like a much easier version of [thing=11825][/thing].  Not that it is an "easy" game, mind you.  Like so many of their games, they take a basic system (in this case [thing=3685][/thing]) and sufficiently modify it to custom fit the theme like a glove.  It is also playable in one sitting and provides plenty of challenges for each side.  Lots of chrome combined with great rules, and challenging strategy = another winner.

I traded this away, because as good as it was, it was too close to [thing=20609][/thing], as AE just did everything better.

Recipe for a Pacific WWII game:   

Axis & Allies or Victory in the Pacific.   
Salt Water - lots of salt water.   
Nice wooden blocks.   
A pinch of historical content.   
Readable rules - also not hard to digest!   
Season to taste.   
Stir well and simmer for 2 - 3 hours.   
Ummmmmm.......wonderful!    

This is a great WWII block game. Just complex enough that you can really sink your teeth into it but still simple enough to play in an evening. The blocks really are perfect for the fog of war that makes this theater so much of a nail bitter.

To really get a feel for the game check out this superb AAR by none other than Jerry Taylor:

A very playable game about the whole pacific campaign. Very challenging in finding a winning strategy for both sides. 

It plays well solo. Just use the blocks open like counters. That way it is even a lot more fun as a sologame than the stupid non-stop-die-rolling-nightmare called Fleet Commander Nimitz.

RATING: 8
The game is not difficult, but rules need to be applicated strictly, otherwise you get biasses in your game results. This is because there are a few indistinctions in the rules. However I like this near-chesslike grand-strategy game very much.
Some minusses:
When the Japanese advance progresses he has got a shortage of infantry/garissons. Then you have to use your expensive planes and ships for this task.
Given the scale of the map, the detail of units is a bit off-size.

RATING: 9
11/25/17: Played the early war scenario, which is probably the most fun if you have the time.  Japanese player had the momentum, and came within a hairs breadth of winning a decisive victory.  I think that concerns about balance are overblown.

A relatively minor nit. I wish that the label were about 1/16th of an inch smaller.  It is a little difficult to center them, and not have a little bit of the label hang off the edge of the block.

7/14/14: In terms of complexity this is somewhere between Axis&Allies and Asia Engulfed.  The rules are 12 pages and very similar to Eastfront, which made learning the game very easy for me.  Have only played the late war scenario so far.  One thing that I do like about this game is that combat effects are sequential rather than simultaneous.  Air effects first, then battleships, then cruisers.

You need an aggressive Japanese player.

10/4/12: Stickered.

This is a very enjoyable game, and one I would play any time.  It's unbalanced in favor of the Allies but that can be remedied by adjusting the victory conditions or the resource points.

After one play: Columbia applies it's block treatment to the Pacific Theater  strategic campaigns during WW2. There's a lot of confusing detail (how to move the various types of units, for starts) that will overwhelm the novice but should be manageable-- maybe even straightforward-- to experienced "block heads." Myself, I don't know why this couldn't have been an area movement game. Bu then, it might feel too much like Victory in the Pacific or maybe even A&A: Pacific. Rate higher by a point or two if Columbia block games are your style.

Like this game a lot, as the player is faced with constant, tough strategic trade-offs and tactical options; I like the headquarters rules. The production choices are tough too, with so many options and so few points. Play the full campaign game, though - it's not that long, and the scenarios really aren't meaty enough for the very textured system to shine through.

In fairness, I think there are serious balance problems here. The Japanese will have a *very* hard time winning (OK, it's basically impossible for them to win). But this is one of only a very few games that I find compelling despite the balance problems. Playing it is just a lot of fun and very evocative, even though the end result is often not unexpected.

Very interesting combat priority mechanism (Naval Air > Army Air > Carrier > Submarine > Battleship > Cruiser > Marines > Infantry).  This is basically the ABC system used in later Columbia block games but it works really well for Pacific Victory.

The game has a very historical feel.  The chrome adding flavor but no bogging down the game.  There are also quite a few optional rules that add even more.

I'm really having fun with this game.

I like it, but I don't love it.  The blocks make for great fog of war, and the asymmetric conditions for both players mean it's a very different feeling for both.  However, it seems that with so few hexes on the board, there may not really be that many different grand strategies for players to choose from.   Mind you, it's only two plays so I could well be wrong.  Still, not quite what I expected.

Nice short, easy game on World War II in the Pacific.  Some historical facts (like cruisers being the backbone of a navy) are worked in VERY subtly.  It's broad-brush, but how else are you going to play WW II in the Pacific in an afternoon?  I disagree with those who say it heavily favors the Allies - although the Japanese DO need to make use of the fog of war which comes with the blocks.

Well, NOW there's Fire in the Sky, which is essentially at the same scale, complexity & playing time.  Only time will tell which I like better - for now it's Fire in the Sky, as I think it's more realistic.  I thus reserve the right to come back here and bump PV down to a 7 or so should that pan out.  ;)  (Done)

This was a game I really wanted to love, but couldn't.  The components are excellent, the (repeatedly) revised rules are clear enough, the block-induced fog of war creates the right mood and the game plays quickly.  The problem is that I always feel a little lost when playing this game.  Maybe it's the amazingly vast scale of the game.  Or maybe it's that it feels as if there are too many, but at the same time too few, blocks to go around.  Or maybe it's that it never really feels like the Japs have a chance to do anything but act as a speed bump.  Or maybe it's that I just don't like block games in general.  I honestly don't know.  I only know that this game never clicked for me.

An evolution of the system from Victory, the generic WWII-era block game, applied to the historical war in the Pacific at a grand strategic scale.

I found PV to be almost unplayable on the standard map due to the fiddliness of constantly manipulating huge clumps of blocks that just barely fit in a hex, but when I had the chance to play it at a con on a huge blowup of the map, it wasn't bad at all.

RATING: 6
A very good block game which is succeeds at grand strategic pacific campaigns. Also, a great bonus is the wide-open nature of the game; you can choose any targets and campaigns, as historical or ahistorical as you wish. The block system works incredibly well for troop types, combat order, 'fog-of-war' in the pacific, and combined arms. However, the strategic situations tend to be reminiscent of Axis and Allies: a lot of build 'em up and knock 'em down, even with all of the clean and elegent simulation values.

Another Columbia Games Gem. 

Complexity lies in between Rommel in the Desert and Hammer of the Scots. Clearer and more intuative rules than Victory.  If they make a game in this line for the war in Europe or on the Eastern Front I would buy it in a second.  

It's seems like they took what was good from their Victory and their Front system games and combined them and came up with Pacific Victory.

My favorite strategic Pacific theater game.  Game begins at the height of the Japanese expansion and consists of the Allies beating Japan down.  Although Japan is not likely to expand further, Japanese defense must be aggresive, so both players are playing offense on a shrinking battlefield.  Strange that Japan wins by lasting long enough to be hit by more than two A-bombs, but still a good game.

Pacific Victory is by no means perfect. The victory conditions are wonky and some aspects of history get short shrift. However, fighting the entire Pacific War in less than five hours is a daunting design challenge. The fact that this game seamlessly incorporates ground, air, and naval warfare, with due consideration to logistics, makes Pacific Victory a minor miracle.

RATING: 5
I initially thought that the Columbia block treatment would be perfect for the Pacific Theater of WW2.  The open oceans and dense jungles benefit from the fog of war created by the blocks.  Contrast this with a confined battlefield such as Gettysburg: Badges of Courage, where the unit concealment just doesn't make sense.

Ultimately, though, I was wrong. The Columbia method is just too simplistic for a situation this complex. It's not designed to handle the PTO's intricacies of supply, projection of power, and combined arms. The most successful Columbia games (EastFront, Rommel, War of 1812, Julius Caesar) are all about maneuvering your forces so that you can apply sharp, decisive force at the right time and place. That's not what the Pacific war was about.

Also, the pace of the game and the victory conditions are not well designed. But if you're reading this comment, you probably already knew that.

Innovative system attempts to resolve age old Igo-Hugo and Fog-of-War issues BUT not being able to even determine whether a bunch of enemy blocks are either ground, naval, or air until contact is a little TOO foggy.

The inability to verify your opponent's resource allocation is an inherant and un-fixable fatal game flaw. Any game where you depend on your opponent's rules comprehension and/or honor to adjust the strength and composition of his forces is a fistfight waiting to happen.

My favorite line in the rulebook is the self defined "elegant mechanics" regarding the playing blocks and their labels; Preen much?

Feels a little too fiddly with weather rules and such.  Rebased a whole lot of CVs and BBs to N Pacific only to find them stuck in weather for two turns.  I guess things will work out if we get a few more games under our belt.  The FOW is a little too chaotic.  It seemed fiddly for the Americans to send 1 strength units to kamikaze so they can be rebuilt back at home.  I like VITP more.

Wooden-block game on World War II in the Pacific.  I sold this one, but I regret it a little because I did like the map.  Unfortunately, the map is underutilized because the game does not emphasize the importance of historical bases.  For example, there is no reason for the American player to base his fleet at Pearl Harbor.  I also found that the game had a significant what-the-heck-do-I-do-now factor after setup.  I can see why wooden-block fans could like it, but I think Victory in the Pacific is a much better choice at this complexity level.

A difficult conflict to simulate but Columbia has done a nice job.  Strengths: great fog of war; simple, nicely executed combat system...far more diverse and interesting than the one used in Columbia's RitD; great choice of a conflict to be gamed.  Weaknesses: set victory conditions, regardless of scenario, that calls a result the Emperor would have given his right arm for a "draw"; playtime is long for a game this simplistic in its decision requirements; not much chance of us ever playing this more than a few times.  Should make for a very good intro to wargaming.

Interesting game that captures the overall feeling of the Pacific Theater.  The game has a huge variety of units, and the fog-of-war from the blocks is a major factor.

The game seemed promising, but there is something which does not work well. I am a great fan of the PTO video game series and pacific victory just does not feel the same. By thinking about all the improvements I could make, I decided that it could just be better that I make my own game. And that's exactly what I did (not published yet (^_^)).

There are still interesting stuff, for example, I liked the hex map, it solved the problem about attack an aircraft range. The rules have a lot of exceptions but again it makes sense because they want to simplify something else. for example, they consider that carriers comes with their planes, so they need some exception rules to deal with carriers. Another thing I did not like is the units and step distribution. For example, The japanese have 3 planes unit in their whole army. Where in hell am I going to place these 3 planes. Normally all the bases in the pacific should have had planes. Japanese start with a lot of infantry with max 1 life. Which mean that you cannot even try to improve them.

I like the fact that you can play 3 players, but it seems that the game is broken: Japanese are way too much diasadvantaged. I know thay try to follow history accurately but the chinese are even not in the war ... WTF!. You cannot even conquer hong kong ... the Hell! it was my first target. I also think the values on the bases are really badly distributed and evaluated.

So many good ideas but the implementation is far from being perfect. I hope my game would be better (^_^).

Maybe block game can apply well to the WW2 Pacific theatre because of the nature of search and destroy naval operations. The publisher still carries stock of this game. Also, it can be playable in one session on table is a big advantage as compared to the more complex games on the same scale and theatre (e.g. VG's Pacific War).  Realism, to a more or less extent, is scarificed  for the sake of playability here.  Nonetheless, still a promising game of wit.

Very clever game, sort of Victory in the Pacific for the 1990s.  Good coverage of the war overall, and the fog of war rules are nice.  Drawbacks: The block approach means named ships a la VITP are not an option.  More importantly, a set of rules that couldn't sit still for years, and victory conditions that are strangely unbalanced for such a fast game.  This one could have been not just good but great.

Have only really played once, I should get this one out some more. It seemed a little generic to me. It is so hard to do a relatively simple Pacific war game. Playing so many others just makes me think of how brilliant Victory in the Pacific is. PV does have a very good strategic 'feel' to it. This is the first block game that made me think that the blocks should indicate whether the unit was an air, sea or land unit. The blocks could have a generic sticker for general type on the hidden side of the block. I really wonder why something like this hasn't been tried yet. At least to my knowledge it hasn't been tried.

This is a very good game that would get a much higher rating from me if not for a couple things: Strategic is my least favorite level of simulation, and the Pacific is one of my least favorite theaters of WWII. Otherwise, this might be an 8 or 9. So it's a pretty darn good game in my estimation for getting a 7 from me despite having some things working against it.

It's a relatively easy game to learn and teach. The latest version of the rules is reasonably clear, so it's not too tough to play. There appear to be several viable strategies for both sides. And it appears to do a good job of "balancing" a game replaying a conflict which the Japanese lost decisively in real life.

I still definitely prefer Rommel and EastFront by a wide margin. It's probably as good as Hammer of the Scots, though.

I will be putting this on my list of games to play at conventions, due to the length and difficulty of finding an opponent. I might not want to spend a whole local game session on it, but it's easy enough to set aside a few hours at a convention.

Purchased via geek auction ended 18 MAR 2010 for $15 plus $12 shipping.

Played once with Josh Hostetler on 14 APR 2010.  I did not understand all of the rules.  Rule book is less than clear in many cases.  Enjoyed the game and would like to try again with the now better understanding of the rules.  I like VITP better for now.

Rules v 2.02 came with the game.  I have printed 2.2 to include with the game.

A nice step up in complexity from A&A Pacific, in that it includes supply rules and requires considerably more planning to coordinate and sustain an attack across the Pacific. There are a few strange rules, but on the whole the game system makes sense and plays well.

My first Columbia Block game, and I found it enjoyable. On the plus side, unique block system gives you Fog of War, map is accurate and very playable, Components are top notch, Rules, once you figure out all the details, give the game a good flow.

On the negative side, The rules have undergone several iterations, cleary showing the designers/developers did not play test enough, Combat system where ships "activate" and fire in a certain order doesn't really make sense, Victory Point level for a Japanese win not realistic and, therefore, house rules or bidding are used to correct this. (In my case, I give the Japanese player a 1/2 VP point for every Allied Production Point blockaded or unsupplied) Submarine's role is not really simulated well either.

Overall, a lighter wargame to give a reasonable re-enactment of the Pacific War that has replay value.

Another purchase awaiting an opponent. Have set up and studied a few times and it feels tricky to get into with many fiddly rules ripe for the players playing different ways due to fog of war factor. Rule bugs too but still reasonably keen to give it a go. But realistically unlikely to find an opponent.

"Pacific Victory" is an enjoyable block game treatment of the war in the Pacific in WW2. It comes with a beautiful map, and when the orange and blue blocks are laid out, it's one of the prettiest set-ups of any game I own. 

I happen to like Columbia's block games, so I pretty much know the system. I also like the choices that can be made in the Production phase of the game--especially for the Allies, which start the war pretty weak and have to crank out the right mix of units quickly to thwart the Japanese in their efforts to quickly create a "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." 

Each time I play I find I have a better handle on the rules, and even before I'm done playing the game I'm thinking ahead to the next time I play and being able to do everything more fully or exactly. Or, in other words, I like this game more every time I play it. 

On that note, as of March 2010, upon repeated plays I've raised my rating from an 8 to a 9. I don't require super complex military simulations to enjoy a game, and this one definitely hits my sweet spot. 

There are three scenarios, in order, of approximately four, three, and two hours in length--although I find they all take me longer than that, but mainly because I record what's going on. Slugging it out in jungle fighting is very tough going, and this game smoothly incorporates air and naval action as well.  

The rule book is generally well written and organized, although, even with only 12 pages of rules, they get a bit "fiddly" and there's certainly quite a bit to keep in mind. At the same time, however, this game is one case in which I found the rule book easier to understand than others generally rate it (usually I consider myself about a half-point 'slow' in grasping the complexity of a given war game). 

Also, there are some spots in which the intended meaning of a rule seems either clear only to the designer or may seem contradictory. 

Note: Even for experienced players, figure maybe 25 minutes for the set-up for the 1941 scenario.

Long slow and tedious ... Multiple rules printing errors, omissions, lack of clarity, skipped points of action are all indicitive of little playtesting. They are at V2 of the rules and STILL making significant changes! Limited or no playtesting and stale presentation seems to be Columbia Games' claim to fame any more. It appears Columbia Games can not come up with anything new ... They did define "block games" in days gone past ... but ... those days are past. The sunset of Columbia Games can not be too far off ... Tried this one again today (25June06) at a friend's urging. I have to drop this down to a 2 ... a very annoying game.

Excellent.  Our first play took way more that the suggested 4 hrs., but was to be expected.  I can see where the criticism that Japan can't win a decisive victory is valid, but it doesn't bother me much.  Japan wasn't going to win that war, anyway. Any game on this theme would have the same problem.

As Japan, I won.

Rating based on first play. Enjoyable game of the Pacific War with the great fog-of-war that blocks provide. The Japanese severely lack production capability, so seizing territory early is key. Looking forward to a trying this with the free placement rules.

I think that this is a very clever design, capturing the pacific war in a quick playing block game.  However, I've decided to play other block games.

The main problem is that the Japanese to win, have to hunker down and play a long slow defensive battle.  If they do anything 'fun', they just speed their doom.  

Not a knock on the game design, I expect that this correctly models the Japanese strategic situation.  But when I play a game I am looking for one where both sides have more places to show initiative.

It's another block game.  All the pieces fit, everything works, but I think the situation leaves something to be desired -- One side or the other is running amuck throughout the game except for a couple of finely balanced turns in the middle.  I'd rather see an operational-scale treatment of the 1942-3 campaigns.  Anything before or after that is a grind for the losing side.  However, taken as it is with the premise it is given, it's a fine game.  Victory conditions should be all or nothing, since that's what it usually comes down to.

The more I play this game, the more I like it.  I've upped it from a 7 to an 8.   The combat system is elegant and every turn the game presents an enormous range of things that need to be done, but you just don't have the means to do a tenth of it.  Just like the war itself.   I'm making a 30% larger map so I can have a little more room for the blocks.

Grand Strategic Fog-of-War Block wargame of the Pacific War.
A tense nailbiter that keeps you feeling like you never have enough assets to keep you both on the defense and the offense at the same time.  For the Japanese, it's a fight against attrition of their superior starting forces; for the Allies, it's a struggle to hang on to their territory until increased production can beat their enemies.

The building is neat and seems to work well with the blocks and the ability to move units across the board in a turn, but there seemed to be very little interesting strategy overall and the Japanese really do feel doomed (I like the way WWII:Barbarossa to Berlin deals with the Germans being doomed much better than the way this does, or rather fails to).

The rules interfere with what is actually a reasonably simple game. Oddly, though, I feel A&A: Pacific offers more interesting decisions (though it's certainly less a consim).

Feels inadequately playtested, as the victory conditions are wonky; narrowing the draw range in Japan's favor seems best.

(Rating based on the full Dec '41 campaign game with the Banzai, Overrun, Fanatic Defense, and MacArthur's War variants in effect.)

[i]Pacific Victory[/i] is one of the few Columbia games to cover a full theater of war, which means that the scale in PV is quite a bit different from other games in their product line.  So the emphasis in PV is more on strategic planning rather than small-scale maneuvering, and sensically each player's long-term options are open-ended due to the wide variety of unit builds available. In fact, the open build options are partly what give PV its unique edge.  And compared to the silliness in [i]Victory: The Blocks of War[/i], the build costs in PV are appropriately priced. 

There is a strict building budget, however. The production points (PPs) available to the Japanese and Allied players are never enough, so unit construction and regrowth is slow, methodical, and expensive.  This means that each strength point loss in combat is an excruciating event.  There's nothing worse than seeing a full-strength carrier get knocked down a pip or two, knowing that it will never be built up again.

In short, I like the game and look forward to additional plays. But I would be remiss if I didn't also state that [i]Pacific Victory[/i] has two prickly problems: rules ambiguity and questionable game balance.  So, as far as recommendations go: If you crack the box with your eyes wide open, are willing to work through rules ambiguities, and are accepting of rebalancing game variants, [i]PV[/i] will work for you.  If not, another PTO game may be to your taste.

Update:

We accidentally played a super-strict version of the MacArthur's War variant in which naval units also had to stay in the SWPA once they were deployed in that theater.  I might stick with this variant permanently to tip the balance towards Japan.

First couple of plays were with my 8-year-old and with a non-gamer.  I'm interested in playing this one more.  It looks like a good game, but I'm not sure having land units and sea units indistinguishable (to your opponent) is a good idea.  Nice components and clear rules.

Very favorable first impression.  This game seems to capitalize on the fog of war effect the blocks offer because there can be certain blocks in a group that would not pertain to any given battle (e.g. marines in a sea group) - so it seems you can really bluff in this game.  I'm really looking forward to playing it again.

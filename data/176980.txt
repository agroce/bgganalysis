The rules were a little challenging but by the third game it all made sense. I've only played solo but this does not seem to detract from the game-play. Solid decision challenges on every move with the sequence of chosen actions having quite an impact.

It's a deckbuilder with some interesting spatial decision space, in regards to where you need your main character to be in order to resolve cosmic crsis.  Unfortunately, lack of different scenarios made this game get old pretty fast...

I bought this game for solo play, not 1v1, but I've yet to play the [thread=1516678]Shadow Conspiracy solitaire variant[/thread] and only have one 1v1 play under my belt. I'm impressed with what I see so far.

While you have the standard mechanisms of a deckbuilder, there are some interesting innovations. Most prominent are the locations. Your spaceship occupies a location each turn and can use that location's bonus ability. Unless, that is, the location is undergoing a crisis (from the event deck each turn). You can deal with the crisis to earn VPs (plus to be a nice space guy, I guess). 

Also nice is that cards you purchase go right on top of your deck for immediate draw. Cards you don't use stay in your hand but you still draw 5 (IIRC) and then you can choose from among the newly drawn and what's in your hand.  This is the opposite of the classic Dominion/Ascension style where everything flushes and gives the game a strategic feel in a different way. Variable starting powers are a nice touch as well. 

So you fly around to different locations to use their abilities/solve their crises while building your deck with the usual upgrade cards. I'd recommend this for anyone who's a pure deckbuilder fan. 

Note that the game is cheap but each copy only plays 1-2 people so you need two copies for a 4P game.

[b]Small-box sci-fi deckbuilder with a few interesting twists; probably, dollar for dollar, the best value deckbuilder around.[/b]

1st play: JUL 2016. It's cheap, it has some novel twists (four different theme-function supply decks for buying from; travel to different planets for different extra effects), it comes in a small box, and it has some variability (due to cards available in supply decks, and starter architects). This doesn't revolutionize deck-building, but if I am only going to own one 2p deckbuilder, I think this is the smart choice.

Helionox is a nice little deckbuilding game with a lot of sci-fi thematic content.

It plays 2 player (or up to 4 player with the larger set/2nd copy), or Co-op, or Solo- that's a huge amount of potential replay value with different counts, and a prime plus for the game.

Players play leaders of Solar (our solar system) Factions, each with their special abilities, and also some Faction bonuses from the faction starter cards.

The game is focused on a series of planetary disasters between 5 Solar locations, and cards used to defeat these or augment one's abilities.  These events also serve as a timer for the game, and ensure a like number of turns- when the last event is drawn the last player takes their final turn.

Especially in the Solo and Co-op games, these can be challenging events to confront, and the game hasn't solved easily so far.

Players can travel from location to location, and use varying resources from cards in-hand to do so; once at a location they can confront events, use local bonuses, or build embassies which optimize travel and also provide better future bonuses.

When players use the Leader's special abilities, there is a nice time delay feature which prevents immediate re-use, making this an interesting decision.

The game also makes card acquisition more attractive by placing new cards atop the draw pile, so you will see them next turn, or possibly this turn if you have a power that enables another draw, a very nice change.

I found the Solo/Co-op versions to be far more challenging, as the timing events happen at a quicker tempo, but it's perfectly playable in competitive form, and is very portable.

There is something here which didn't immediately grab me like RftG did, but that said, this game does many great things for a very nice price, and it offers a deckbuilding experience which isn't just shooting at each other to remove cards each round- my primary reason for disliking Magic and it's 1M clones.

If one is a deckbuilding fan, this is a nice little game which innovates in many ways, and creates an interesting gaming experience without taking the whole afternoon- worth looking into!

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I enjoyed this one although it is very short and one must do the most possible in a very short window - (9 turns). There is deckbuilding but don't expect to see a card a lot in some instances unless you are able to cull cards from the deck. Later turns do take some time as one works through the options and maximizes points. The game as produced only plays two unless you get a second base game. There is a fair bit of replay value and strategies to explore at least for a while.

Adding locations to the deck building formula has reinvigorated a stale genre. Helionox truly separates itself from the pack in this aspect. This small edition adds more than you'd imagine and makes each decision a bit tougher.

[microbadge=1714]

[u]13-Feb-2016[/u]:  This is a sci-fi themed deckbuilder that sits comfortably in between Star Realms and Legendary: Marvel in terms of complexity, game length, and physical space.  Helionox is a fairly straightforward deckbuilder at its core, but it has a few nice tweaks that make it interesting.  First, there is a movement aspect to the game.  Each location has a different special action the player can potentially use.  This is almost like an additional card that is always in play for you to use.

Newly acquired cards go on top of your deck for immediate draw, and cards not used at the end of your turn are held during the draw phase.  Then you may chose your hand from all those available.  Also, I like how the market is set up in four draw piles corresponding to the four different Factions.  This way, one card from each Faction (which generally focus on a different aspect of the gameplay) is always available for purchase.

Add to all this some excellent artwork, a small box (similar to Death Angel), and a reasonable price, and you've got a really solid, little game.  At the time of this post, I'm enjoying the fan made solo variant, [thread=1516678]The Shadow Conspiracy[/thread].  The solo rules in the box offer a very brief game session and don't allow for full use of the deckbuilding mechanisms in the 2P game.

Overall, I'm pleased with this game.  It isn't super deep, but it has enough going for it to keep me interested, give me some challenge, and work my brain with the puzzly gameplay to maximize my endgame score.

[u]07-Nov-2016[/u]:  I created a new solo variant for [b]Last Sunset[/b] based on the one a few of us created for the (hopefully someday) [b]Mercury Protocol[/b] expansion:  [thread=1572916]The Shadow Returns (The Last Sunset Edition)[/thread].  It has three difficulty levels and provides a slightly more complex and varied experience than the Shadow Conspiracy variant, IMO.  It presents interesting, puzzly gameplay based on the relation between the Market and Events in play and the need for the player to move from location to location.  Both variants have their place in this universe, though, and I still recommend the Shadow Conspiracy to anyone playing this game.

RATING: 6
Fast playing and thematic SF deck builder game that reminds me a bit of Core Worlds.

Definitely read the most up to date rules and/or the rules update before your first game.  The most current rules set (Jan 2016) has been formatted for improved clarity, readability and includes the rules update/FAQ.

Good first impressions, but faded with repeat play due to lack of variability in gameplay.

General comments:

- nice card art.
- streamlined rules and mechanics with a good thematic feel.
- much more of a tactical game than one of long term planning, but that's OK given the game's short length (about 40 minutes for 2p) and generally true of most deck builders that I've tried.
- nice to have co-op and solitaire rules (haven't tried yet).

Sold March 2016 at Breakout Con.

Delivered KS on time (although minus the few stretch items). Card stock looks a bit flimsy. Artwork good but not super - the art team have cleverly used the limited resources they have at their disposal. Theme is very good. Rules a little poor. It made very little sense at first. Thank the gods for Rahdo :)

Have only played this solo but I like the feel. For a quick and engaging experience this is a good investment. Plus, there is something nicely addictive about it...

What if Star Realms actually required thought, and lasted long enough for your deck building decisions to evolve meaningfully?  You'd end up with something similar to Helionox.
I'm generally not a fan of deck building games as I find them super random, but Helionox pleasantly surprised me.  The semi-cooperative mechanics are clever, and there are enough avenues to success that you only occasionally feel the whim of random card draw determining your competitive progress.

After just two plays with my wife I can certainly say that this is my new fav deck builder. Would love to see variable end game missions to change things up. 

Also considering house ruling that the first player to meet an end game objective, gets it.

Unplayable with the printed rulebook.  It's complete and, in one place, even says "beta" directly in the printed rulebook!  Unacceptable.

I've heard the solo game is pretty good if you get the right ruleset, but I have no tolerance for games whose printed rules are not functional.

Great deck builder!

Pros:
- Lots of strategy and thought provoking decisions to make each turn.
- Lots of different types of cards available (there's only one copy of each card in 2-player, 2 copies in 4-player)
- A definite build in suspense
- Thematic
- Great art
- Scalable for 2-4 players
- Different than other deck builders I've played.  There's definitely more of an active feel to it since you can travel to different locations to get bonuses and have to confront various bad events.

Cons:
- Some of the Architects seem not as useful as others but this could be my perspective because some do not jive with my strategies *shrugs*

Thoughts:
The Kickstarter sent out the 4-player cards in the same box as the 2-player so it's a little cramped in there with card sleeves.  I had to use KMC Perfect Fit sleeves in order to ensure everything fit back in the same box.

A wonderful take on the deckbuilder genre with a lot of flexibility.   It features an engaging theme and solo, co-op, and competitive modes of play.

Pros:
- Theme:  The game's theme is truly engaging and unique.  It really gives you a sense of place and location as you play.   This is especially true when playing co-op, where the events give the game a "Pandemic" feel to it.
- Artwork:  The art is absolutely gorgeous!  This is truly a beautiful game.
- Fun Factor:  With all the flexibility and mix of genres here, it is sure to appeal to a lot of people.

Cons:
- The cardstock:  I love the art on the cards, but abhor the physical cards themselves.  They are given such a heavy linen finish that the cards stick together.  Mitigation:  sleeve them.
- The rulebook:  The rules are a touch spotty as the mountain of clarifications and errata in the forums here easily point out.   Mitigation:  Make sure you print out and keep the rules errata that is being maintained by the author.

This is a good deck builder, with an interesting theme.  The thing that I like is that you have a hand size of five, and any cards you don't use can be kept.  Then you draw five cards and then discard down to five.  This really solves the problem of having junk hands in a deck builder.  My only complaint is that the rulebook is a bit unclear on some of the rules.  I had a few situations where I didn't know what to do, so I had to hunt for answers online.

Sci-fi space deck-builder with variable player powers and a worker placement component. Solitaire or 2 player. Add a second deck to play 4 like Star Realms. Players travel around the central display of off world planet cards to eliminate social and enviro events using "defense" points. Planets provide special benefits when active. Cycle the use of player special abilities with cryo tokens. Its unique deck builder characteristics are; draw cards after round are added to unused cards then discard down to hand size, purchased cards go to the top of your deck.

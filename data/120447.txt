RATING: 7.5
A fun game where you try to kill someone off.  I took some risks in my first game, mainly to see how things worked out.  We had a full set of six people and it was a lot of fun.  Sadly, I didn't win, but I didn't do too poorly either, as I was able to make several attempts at a kill that came close to succeeding - forcing others to use their points on me.

Won on the second play.  I had a perfect motive, crime and opportunity.  People needed to stop my seven points... and they failed at six!  Mwa-ha-ha!  Take that Doctor J. Robert Lucky!  Not so lucky this time!

The game is fun.  I love the theme.  And the text on the cards is incredible!  The names!  The motives!  The spite!  Worth owning purely for the flavor text!

The turn order mechanic was good, but it felt like a "build up your hand quickly for the final battle that ultimately comes down to luck" game.  [b]Kill Doctor Lucky[/b] felt disjoint also, if I remember correctly.

I admit our playing of this game has slowed down - we don't play it as often - but it is one my wife and I always end up pulling out when we sit down for a night of board or card games. The games are rarely different though, we always have the same strategy, but even so we never know who will win. Good amount of luck and I have seen a few different ways to strategize that are helpful. Great game to play with family and friends. I've never seen a bad reaction to this game.

Quick fun card game.  Build up (or exchange) in sequence your numbered characters) and then maybe attempt to murder Doctor Lucky.  Opponents try to thwart your attempt but won’t be able to for ever.

Players should stay as far away as possible from this game.

 It consists of 15-30 minutes of meaningless gameplay followed by a Munchkin-style endgame where a player only wins when their opponents run out of attack cards. Munchkin may last longer, but it at least has some skill and interesting cards.

Hand management game.  A card game variant of Kill Doctor Lucky.  You try to kill Doctor Lucky while stopping everyone else from killing him first.  It's short and has minimal setup/take down, so it's a good filler game.

This is a card version of “Kill Dr. Lucky”. It plays quickly (15 minutes or so), and it does have many similarities to its big brother. In turn, you either play or draw cards or announce that you want to kill Dr. Lucky. As in the real Kill Dr. Lucky, it means that you can force other people to use their cards if you’re ahead of them in turn order – but of course you have to be careful that you’re not relying on the others to stop the attack in case they don’t have enough cards, which I’ve seen happen in both versions of the game… While it’s an “ok” game that shouldn’t be taken too seriously, I really hate the “Munchkin”-like aspect of the game; when a player is about to win, the other player does everything they can to negate this, and then the next player wins… In Get Lucky, it’s sort of the same; after a couple of attacks, the cards are drained, and it feels somewhat random who ends up winning the game.

RATING: 6
This fills the same niche as Munchkin with a much shorter time limit and a fun, "last hand" building experience, but since that experience isn't really the most necessary, it's occupying an endangered niche, especially with classic card games like Durak that exist.

Very short card game variant of the Kill Doctor Lucky board game.   The main mechanism is the same...   try to time your assassination attempt so that there are not enough Spite cards left in player's hands to stop you.   In the board game, you have to hunt him down as well, and worry about lines of sight.   Those aspects are eliminated here, which is why this is so quick.

Mildly interesting game of hand management.  Deterministic character of assassination attempts a mixed blessing; no bad die rolls, but little excitement.  Compact and good for travel, especially if you ditch the box.  Quick and easy to teach and learn.  So much theme text that you're tempted to skip it to keep the game moving along.

Not all of the theme comes through in the card-based game, and the silly character names are a touch too silly for my personal taste. My group doesn't ever seem to get fully into it, so this is a rare play for me.

I thought this game would have an element of deduction, but as it turns out this is a nicely themed light filler game of power up, attack and defend card game. The win can be incredibly underwhelming and anticlimactic. Although there is a great element of strategy involved in game play itself, your win comes more from others mistakes. It does play relatively quickly, and I can see a win average offering more satisfaction than a single game. I've played 2 and 3 players ... This game might burst into life with a full table. 
This game has potential but the jury is still out on this one.

* Kickstarted! *

A quick card game from Cheapass in which you try to kill Dr. Lucky while preventing others from doing it. The strategy comes in knowing when to try, since you don't to replenish your hand too easily. Fun, fast, and worth playing multiple times as a starter game.

PLUS: easy to learn at all ages, goes quickly
MINUS: the winner will be default at the end

In this game you control different people trying to kill a guy for various reasons, depending on the cards you play. There's a lot of flavor on the cards, but in most sessions, it just gets lost. It's a fun little game, but unremarkable at times. That said, we've played it a LOT so there is that.

Good production values -- the cards are funny, the flavor text deserves to be read, and the art is very enjoyable.  I would say that the production value is perhaps the best part of the game.  The game mechanic is unimaginative, uninspired, and not very interesting.  Luck plays a big role in the game, and the actions that one can do are very limited and repetitive.  Bluffing/deduction is minimal or non-existent.  ENjoyable to play with friends, but there are many better card games out there that occupy the same niche and are more interesting and entertaining.

I wasn't optimistic that this would be better than the original, but it's leagues better in every way. It has more layers than the original, plays more smoothly, and is much more interesting.

Every turn offers interesting decisions: Do I add this matching weapon to a character, or hold the card for its stoppage value? Do I pass and hope someone else will stop a murder attempt? Is this character with Spite on them worthless, or should I hold onto them? Should I swap characters so my turn will come up sooner?

I'd happily play this again.

Get Lucky is a card game in which players are attempting to be the one to kill Doctor Lucky.

Each player has two characters to start the game.  The characters are trying, through card play, to have a motive, get a weapon, and an opportunity to have the best chance for the kill.

Players take turns in order of card rank.  Every character card has a number from 1 - 15.  On their turn players either: play a card, take a card, switch one of their character cards out from a pool in the middle of the table, or attempt to kill the doctor.

Once a kill attempt has been announced, other players around the table may either try to stop the murder, or pass.  Whichever player successfully kills Doctor Lucky wins the game.

Get Lucky is a fairly fast, and fun, game.  There are interesting decisions regarding what to do with your cards.  The same cards used to build up your characters for the kill attempt are used to stop others from killing Lucky.  So, what do you do; use them for your own purposes, or to stop others?

Get Lucky is a solid little filler.

A fun, little card game that evokes the feeling of Kill Doctor Lucky.  The flavor text on the cards is wonderfully funny.  The game has a light and engaging build-up period where you power-up the characters you control.  During this time, there is a kind of stand-off - where no one wants to accumulate spite (a weakness in this game), so no-one want to attempt to murder the Doctor. Eventually, there is a mad rush of murder attempts which brings the game to a conclusion in 15 - 20 minutes.

I'm pleasantly surprised to see that the card game version was able to improve upon the board game version, mostly by removing fiddly elements such as room-to-room movement and line of sight.  The addition of Motive and Opportunity cards help to enhance the theme, although now Spite tokens seem to do the opposite of what they did in the board game.

This rating is based on the 2 player game, as that is all I have played.  This game quickly becomes about boosting one of your characters to ridiculous levels while using the other characters to attack and drain your opponents luck cards before performing the coup-de-grace.  Hopefully playing with more players will alleviate this repetitiveness.

Edit:  Have played with more players and the game quickly becomes about going through the deck so you have as many cards in hand as possible, then playing through these cards as described above.  I wish these light hand management games would just have you start out dealing the entire deck to the players, as that is what almost always ends up happening anyway.  It would cut out the boring "I draw X cards" arms race at the beginning and jump straight to the actual card playing action.

Worth owning just for the comical card texts which make for good reading at the close of the game--so and so killed Doctor Lucky with such and such motivation. Some of the best writing in games. 

I've played with three so far and have done well. The deck was exhausted in two of the three games and then we all started taking potshots at each other, with some exceptions. It might be better with more than three.

All in all, this is quick, light fun and is fairly random, but there are choices to be made and strategies to pursue. I'm still eager to play, and it's a good icebreaker. 

Nice atmospherics, game only so-so.

Quirky, quick and light.  It's a fun theme with some fun artwork and character names and background that all help with the mood.  The gameplay is pretty simplistic, just attaching cards to characters you control in hopes of getting enough points on them that other players can't discard enough to stop you in succeeding with your nefarious plans.  There is a little strategy in planning in trying to setup the right character cards and sandbag the right people to hope and jockey for position to time your kill at the right point.

Having to do turn order through the cards is kind of clever, but felt awkward, the whole game figuring how who is next, looking through all of the cards. Also, the first half of the game is pretty slow as people generally don't want to sacrifice their cards first.

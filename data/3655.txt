Excellent spin-off of Settlers of Catan.  Actually think I like it a little better than Catan because of the added Jerusalem portion.  Didn't make a "10" because the rules could stand to be a  little more clear in some areas and it'd be nice if the tiles were random instead of in fixed locations.

Settlers of Catan set in ancient Mesopotamia... it's a decent improvement over regular Settlers, but there's really no reason to play it if you have access to the Cities & Knights expansion for Settlers.

An outstanding Settlers variant with a light Biblical theme pasted on. Klaus Teuber designed this one for a Christian game company, but given the theme (northern Canaan in the books of Joshua, Judges and 1 and 2 Samuel), it can be called a Jewish game just as much as a Christian one. But again, the theme is very light, so it should offend only the most dogmatic of secularists. It incorporates elements of both Seafarers and Cities&Knights, and does so quite well. The building of Jerusalem is a unique feature that has the potential to lead to a sudden end of the game, but I have not seen this happen yet. A drawback to Settlers of Canaan is that, being a historical scenario, the board is permanently fixed: no random set-up here, folks. As well, the hexes are somewhat smaller than standard Settlers (in the original edition), but the pieces are not, so it can get slightly crowded. So why buy Canaan, if you're not a Cataniac? Well, for one thing, not always, but most of the time, it seems to play quicker than other Settlers games; but that just might be a fluke with the people I play with.

Good religiously themed variant of the original. Although fixed-board, does not lose out to the original in terms of game play. Expandibility limited though.

We played this game for a few years before we finally had the money to get Catan and two of its expansions.  Because we played this game as much as all other games combined, we knew we loved the concept.  Now it is just an overflow if we have more than six for Catan.

I don't like the board design -- it doesn't seem right that bricks and rocks for building temple stones are right next to the city, making the initial starting location too obvious.

RATING: 9.9
As fun as the original, and with a much faster set-up time.  If you want more variety in future plays, simply cover the numbers on the preset board with random number chits from the Catan game.  It works very well.

The board is plenty big for a 5th player.  A 6th player makes the board a little tight, but still works.

The bricks add a nice touch.  Don't know how much replayability it has due to the non-modular board.

RATING: 5
Yeah, basically this is Settlers without the modular board and with a Bible theme.  Don't mind either, but it's not about to set the world on fire, or replace the Catan card game as my choice for two-player Catan.  This works fine for two, though, without the trading - perhaps because the board is fixed and the numbers are matched to spaces by resource type, it seems you get cards pretty rapidly and usually have enough to trade with the bank.  The chits are a little cheesy, being miscut by the publisher, but at least we have the version with wooden, rather than plastic, bits.  Got it in a math trade, and my Ashar likes it plenty.  Dice, dice, dice.

This is a worthy expansion, but didn't add enough for the price tag for me to pick it up. It's not an expansion (its a stand alone game) but feels somewhat like an expansion. Fixed board, with the additional goal of helping to build the wall of Jerusalem. Feels like the historical scenarios.

this game is a lot of fun. Very similar to Settlers of Catan, but it adds the building of Stones on jerusalem and the board is static.

Not as good as Catan, but a nice variation.

Compare with SETTLERS OF CATAN
The game uses the same basic mechanics as Settlers of Catan but adds some unique elements, similar to the Historical Scenarios. In the case of this game, players build the wall of Jerusalem by contributing bricks. The player who contributes the most bricks earns victory points and the right to use a special "rule-breaking" power of his/her choosing. This is contested in the same manner as "the longest road" from Settlers.

Always enjoy this game. I do sometimes get frustrated with any games that involve trading when you think trading doesn't go fairly. Not that trading needs to be fair. If I keep my focus on having fun it goes much better. Of course it is very subject to dice rolls and the robber!

I wish the board were variable. However, it's much larger than in the original, so you don't feel as boxed in; and trading, which becomes tiresome for me, is not as important.

RATING: 7
A fun family game with an Old Testament theme. This is a "remake" of Settlers of Catan and plays very similarly with only a few differences. I think I bought this game shortly after it was made (2002), seeing it in a game store, titled with a Biblical name. I had never played it nor Catan. I liked it right away as well as some friends. And shortly after bought Catan. But in a couple years it got put away and never played until Labor day weekend 2014. I introduced it to my wife and youngest son who both loved it.

There are not very many good Christian board games out there. And this is more Old Testament themed rather than Christian New Testament themed. And while it has the Old Testament theme, the core enjoyment comes from the widely entertaining mechanics and game play of Catan. 

Some people think the changes and addition this game has, makes it better than Catan. I agree a bit. Either case, both are good games, and thus this is a very good game. It was nice to get this on the table again.

Biblical version of Catan. Looks like the re-designers wanted something more difficult to get into, rule wise. Not very elegant I must say. No knowledge of the Bible required. Would have been better, if you are going to start messing with the mechanics, to make it work with all 12 tribes of Israel for 12 players. It would need a much bigger board, but it would be a blast with a dozen people playing. Biggest beef is that buying stones to build Jerusalem seems to be a fast track for winning. Second biggest beef are the development cards. C'mon they should make sense and a difference. We like the old-timey illustrations though.

I don't think this game is anywhere near as interesting as the original game it is derived from. There are a few new additions like the wild-10 hex and the wall of Jerusalem, but why did they make a fixed board? It was entertaining the first few plays, but with the same board everytime, I lost interest quickly. I give them credit for a very engaging Biblical/historical theme. Without that theme, however, the rating would be lower.

Very poor quality components considering. Poorly made chits, cheap card stock, dark dull graphics, a complex board, possibly unbalanced leading to difficult hand management, odd rules variants, over long scoring.

Otherwise, you might want to play someone else's copy before investing.

Played 1 time. Plays similat to original S.o.C. but extra building possibility: stones in Jerusalem. Leader in stones gets a free 2:1 port of their choice. Very powerful. Fixed board AND numbers may hurt long term playability, but good scenario that fits well. Rebuilding Old Testament Israel theme could also have nice appeal to Christian and Jewish families.

At it's heart, it is Settlers, which is good. It loses points for several reasons. First, the components are not nearly as nice. The tokens in the edition don't even fit on the spaces they are supposed to (though there is a coupon from the company due to this error). The color scheme is not as pleasing, and does not have as much board detail. Also, the board is not modular. Makes for easy setup, but really limits replayability. Also, the cut-throat and crowded feelings are gone. This may be a positive for some, but it's not like Catan had so much player interaction already. This turns it into multiplayer solitaire. All in all, I can see why some people would like this one. I just can't see why anyone would like this one BETTER than the original. So when you have Settlers of Catan already, this one is just a bit redundant.

RATING: 7
OK, geek confession.  I did not buy this game, but re-implemented it with regular Settlers components.  I had to change the theme a little, and then I went off the deep end...

I have always been fascinated witht the history of the Holylands of Canaan.  So, I developed stacks of geography and sculpey pieces for players to "build" Jerusalem instead of just bricks.  

I added some of the "Events of Catan" items to key stone building times, so that play is accellerated at the beginning, and hampered in the end game.  I added historical "flavor" cards to the stone building events.  I built a board so that hexes didn't have to be used.  Finally, I have a "stone building" track that players use for the "Preist's Blessing".  

I definitely put more time into the game than the play deserves, but Hey! it was fun.  I also probably reached the cost tradeoff in supplies...  Pictures on request.

Bottom line, I think my copy is an 8, but the original a 7 due to slower play than the original Settlers and the uninspired "brick building" section.

Yeah, it's settlers but is a nice change.  Like the added action of building temple stones and resulting victory point card that can be obtained.  Cards are very good quality.  Don't like the colors of the map.  Religious theme is well done.

Not a major addition to the Settlers family. Mild historical flavor added through ugly cards. Building Jerusalem was not necessary. I had the bonus points & only built 1 brick. Best innovation was the get anything you want hex.

RATING: 6
The temple stones part seem a bit broken, or maybe the game ends too fast when a person can make them easily, we house-rule that they're worth less victory points to counter. I prefer this game over Catan as it's faster to setup and basically the same game.

I spent some of my Christmas money on this one. It is the only Settlers game I have. I've only played it once with just 2 players.  I enjoyed it, but I can see where it should be even better with 3 or 4 players.   Update: Played a 3-player game and really enjoyed it much more than 2 players.   I've now played with 4 and that is even better.   The copper hex that can produce any commodity type is definitely a magnet for the plague.

Downside: Board is fixed and predictable.

RATING: 9
This is my favourite version of all the variations of catan that I have. Its only let down in my opinion is that it is a set board. The resources have a set position and the value of the dice needed for those resources is also set. Other than that I love the game.
Number 1.

However, if a non-Christian has any notion that the Jerusalem wall is within the Bible it may bring up the idea, "if I do not believe in Christ I am not heading the right way". For some non-Christian people this conviction is a part of all Biblically themed games, even if they do not need to know anything about the Bible.

The flip side is, that many of my friends are Christian and this adds to enjoyment of the game substantially for us. Also I have Settlers and a few Settlers expansions, so the set board and set dice roll values for resources, is not a significant problem for me.

A nice Biblical version of Catan. The main difference is the board is pre-set and you build Stones in Jerusalem. A major change we play with is that when Jerusalem is complete the game does not end, just the struggle for the "King's Blessing" card. Miss Panda's game.

The real Settlers is awesome.  Canaan is in every way worse, but still a good game if you don't know what you're missing.

Catan has a board that is completely scrambled and makes the game different every time.  Canaan is fixed in place.  It's still fun, but there is no reason for this to exist.

I must say I don't enjoy too much 'Settlers of Catan'... though I consider it a very important icon in gaming history and a clever game, it just was too dry and generically themed for me. I bought this version to see if an historical connection would help, and it does to a certain extent, but I just don't enjoy the game too much. 

I feel the game is too long for the enjoyment you get out of it, and the dice mechanism, though clever, never leaves me satisfied... Though, as you can see if you look at my collection, I enjoy dice games very much, the idea of 'building a production site' and potentially not produce anything didn't click with me, you can many times feel 'cheated' in a cheap way because of this.

Pretty good derivative of Settlers with interesting additions of building the walls of Jerusalem, which may grant the "Kings Favor" for 2 VPs and a 2 for 1 trade on a specified resource.  Plays to 12 points.  Lots of hexes (fixed) which means lots and lots of resources for everyone, which is nice but games seem to inevitably end in a blanket finish - seems to be less genuine skill here, but its still entertaining.  A good option if you are one of those who think that the initial placement is too important in the base game.

My family has owned this game for 8 years. We play it so much that the box is duct taped to keep it together. We have made a 5-player expansion for it along the right side of the board. It plays as good as Catan because of the board layout. It does miss the random layout that Catan provides. I would highly recommend this game to anyone with young kids through teenagers. The entire Catan concept was a great idea.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A very good historical/Biblical Settlers variant. The loss of replayability from having a static board is compensated for by the new elements of building Jerusalem and the "copper" terrain that produces any resource of your choice.  I dislike the plastic components (compared to the original wood bits in Catan), but the board is beautiful and high quality.

If you're looking for a Christian/Jewish themed game or want an interesting historical Settlers of Catan variant, give this a try.

This game is so good for being stand alone, the map is fabulous even though it is set, and creates opportunities for different games each time you play. The stones for Jerusalem is a great little addition too. Somewhere along the road I got more into gaming and this one fell along the wayside and I haven't played it as much anymore. Fun though and good for trying out new strategies.

A fun historic varient for Settlers.  Nicely ballanced with copper in the north and Jeruselem in the south.  Hexes have higher production values than other Settlers games, so things get going quickly.  But then the game can end suddenly, with little warning for those not paying close attention!  Some find this annoying...

An excellent game, without the randomness of the original Catan series. This may be an issue for some, but I like being able to choose my strategy based on the board's layout. The only reason I don't give this game a 10 is due to the fact that the concept is not an original one. Settlers of Catan came first.

Settlers is still to this day my go to game. My friends come over and if there are enough people the question is always "Settlers?" To this day the constant haggling battle ends friendships and creates new ones, causes great walls of roads to form, city to rise where you wanted to put make them, and resources to be stolen back and forth. If you like your friends don't play this game. If you have too many this is a great way to weed them out.

My introduction to Euro Gaming.  Love this game and now can't wait to build my library of Euro Games.

-Because of this site and finding so many new and intersting game my interst in this game has wained slightly because of so many other new games. Lowering from a 9 to an 8.  Still a great game, just not the first I choose.  

I really enjoy the extra stategy of building the wall of Jersualem in this game over the base one.  It adds a nice little dynamic that is not in the original.

This game is a little more friendly than Settlers of Catan, in that there are more "good" places to build.  And usually it is a very close game.

The stones for Jerusalem element seems too powerful: two victory points AND a 2-for-1 trade advantage? Yikes! But then, the stones aspect can shorten the game (compared to vanilla Catan) - which is a good thing. Anytime a shortened game is "good", must mean the original game is "bad". If your settlements are not producing early in any SoC type game, the experience will be painful - leading one to ask "Are we playing this just to build our tolerance for unpleasant tasks?"

Played this 5-6 times, mostly with son (there are 2-player rules, unlike regular Settlers). I like it okay as a Settlers variant. I rarely ever get involved with building the temple, usually just develop the primo hexes and use the traditional methods. 10-19: I loaned this to a relative (or so I thought). Turns out he thought I "gave" it to him. I liked this game, but am no longer really into Settlers, so I will not repurchase unless I get a crazy sale.

I am a huge Catan fan and I will say that this game has components that make this game more intresting then the BASIC Catan game (not the case if you add the expansions). The event cards are far better then the basic Catan and the addition of the wall building, the copper tile and the 2to1 Kings Blessing make for new components that each player has to decide go for. Again Catan is the mack daddy classic, I love it. But this game is very fun and plays 2 player MUCH better then Catan does. I also like the victory point counter. The art work is FANTASTIC on the board and the cards!

By far the best themed and balanced settlers game to date!  Everything is there right out of the box ready to go.  No more random setups with crazy land layout.  There are so many different angles to try to win with.  I have played this game with several non-gamers who were able to learn in about 7 min and my wife loves the game also.  If you only own one settler's game, this one should be it.  It is a perfectly balanced board which makes it best for new comers and also for experts alike.  Only gripe I have is my wife's lucky rolls first few rounds always sending me the plague to mess up my production!  :)

What I like about this edition: Not having to set up the board, the board not being at risk of disintegration during play; the gloomy public domain Victorian bible art, and the "Made in North Carolina" banner; the 'building Jerusalem' mechanic is a good addition to the game, allowing another way to score and ease trading, and acting as a game clock; the fact that the rules and components are pretty much otherwise vanilla Settlers; that you can use Cities and Knights and play "Crusaders of the Holy Land".

What isn't so great: the black and the blue Jerusalem bricks are the most indistinguishable game components I have yet seen - in one sense this does provide for a deeply challenging bonus game, in most other senses, this is a bit of a silly oversight, to say nothing of the note offering $5 off other games in the stable as compensation for the tiles being too big (can I sue if I follow their Exacto-knife easy-alteration directions and slice off a thumb?); although the Jerusalem mechanic does something for it, this is hardly any more of a 2 player game than vanilla Settlers, especially as the map is non-customizable, and thus too big.

Would I buy this in place of vanilla Settlers? Being someone who only plays occassionally, yes, providing this were cheaper, which I believe it usually is. 

Overall verdict: this retheming fits really well, especially being built on a solid pun; I would be curious to see biblical reinterpretations of other popular board games...

 I tend to like this version better than the original. Board is always the same, but more plentiful. The stones of Jerusalem add another option to help ensure victory.

The game is fun, and adds some unique elements to the Catan formula, but the fixed board hurts it.

RATING: 7
When introducing non-gamers to Settlers, I often take this instead of the base game because it's more immediately appealing to the eye and it has a stronger theme. Plus, the (fixed) board layout is really well thought out, makes for some interesting games, and the stones for jerusalem spice up the game somewhat.

Production quality is a bit low, but overall this is a nice variant of Settlers with an interesting map and an interesting alternative rule. Note, however, that it's essentially the same variant as the Cheops Historical Scenario and as the Settlers of Z. The only difference between the three is the maps.

A very good variation of the Jewish/Christian theme using the award-winning mechanism of the original Settlers of Catan. This set is complete in itself, without the additional add-ons, unlike Catan. The game is a little more challenging, multiple tasking, resource management, trading, etc. I love it very much, but hard to introduce to new gamers. I believe experienced gamers would like this game very much!

like the walls of jerusalem variant, but stuck board, cant change resources. Still, it is well balanced and ppl new to the game don't have to think hard of where to place and can do well.

My favorite of all the Settlers variants.  The wall adds a great deal of strategic depth and the board design offers many options.  Surprisingly great game.

RATING: 8.5
Attractive game; theme has nothing to do with the actual Israelite conquest of Canaan, which was primarily done by the sword. The building of the walls of Jerusalem figures more into post-exilic Israel than the settling of the land, while the Plague rule would be more for the captivity in Egypt when Moses came along (Biblical quibbling, I know...).

But this is a Settlers game, after all. And I did purchase it for use with fellow Christian friends who wouldn't play anything heavier than this, so it works well in that regard. And I like it much better than I thought I would. Have raised my rating from 7 to 8.5.

Side note: tough for a blue-green color blind friend to differentiate the sheep, wood and ore spaces

Seems like it&#039;s probably a reasonable game with 4 players, but as I bought it for a 2 player version of Catan, have been a bit disappointed as to how random the game seems. For 2 players, the control seems to all be in the dice rather than the players.

Oh, this is probably fine. I just didn't care for getting a note in the box saying I needed to cut the pieces because they were too big. Turned me off to the game in general and I sold it before I ever played it.

The timing mechanism of the Jerusalem Wall stones is a really neat addition, and injected a lot of new tension and decisions in the first game I played. but I don't know how often that will come to pass...my second game was a more typical Settlers game, though the wide open board, generous resources, and more plentiful victory points kept all 4 players viable in the game and usually awash in resources. In this game, it seems a bit tougher to build cities, as the ore and grain build slowly, but once they get built, the resources available go crazy. But again, that's just two plays with two different feels. My wife would already rather go back to Cities & Knights. I could see playing this version 1 out of every 4-5 times we play Catan.

I liked the idea of a set board both for ease of setup and to make people (family) more comfortable due to the familiar layout for each game. The stones of Jerusalem seemed more a distraction than a cool new feature though.

Given away to a family who might get some play from it. I have too many games for this to see any play.

Doesn't alter the original concept too much and adds just enough to make this my favorite of the "historical" variants of Catan.

Not quite as good as Settlers of Catan, but that&#039;s still a compliment! A great introduction to the series, with one more variable, and a decent historical theme. A pity the stone tiles are the wrong size, but still worth getting as well as SoC if you *love* it, but they really are quite similar.

Forget any religious connotations.  This might as well be pushed as a Catan Histories version.  The set gameboard and innovative use of building the wall at Jerusalem make the game more interesting than garden variety Catan.  I don't know if they're still publishing this one but it's worth getting if like the historical versions.

I really enjoy this game, even though I'm still a novice and haven't learned the various basic strategies. I had the opportunity to play the "Little Settlers" variant (2 players) and really enjoyed it. At first, we thought it wouldn't be enjoyable since the map seemed so small, but the speed with which resources began moving changed that perspective.

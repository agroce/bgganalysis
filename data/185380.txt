RATING: 9
Fun and fast paced 2D fighting game. 4 fighters each play a little different.  Uses similar mechanics to BattleCON, but has a faster set-up and play time. Compared to BattleCON this game is much more about hand management and hand advantage than strategy and opponent reading.

More people should be checking out this game. I have Battlecon but for me this system is just plain BETTER. If you like Battlecon, but want something that plays faster and simpler but still has strategic and tactical bite, CHECK this OUT!

Miss the opportunity of a retail storage solution, card divider files and a printable or DIY version of the playmat. Game is solid but i could be so easy to make everybody happy. Even Star Realms had a small storage solution availaible. And last but not least there are no downloadable rules available. Overall i like the game but all the surroundings are very poor!!!

I didn't expect much from this, being that it is from Level 99 Games and Jasco, two companies that have been very spotty for me in terms of quality. Excuse the pun, but Exceed really exceeded my expectations. I've played a lot of these board/card game conversions of fighting games, but I think Exceed is easily my favorite. It doesn't do anything that new or noteworthy, but it combines a lot of the best aspects of games like Yomi, Battlecon, and Flash Duel into a system that works really well. I'm a little annoyed that you have to track down all the individual sets, and having foil cards mixed in with regular cards promotes unintentional cheating while shuffling, but otherwise I think that this is the best fighting system Level 99 has come out with yet. It really feels like Magic: The Gathering if it was a fighting game. I hope this continues to get support, as well, as this really makes Battlecon obsolete for me. Puzzle Strike is pretty close to the same quality as this, but this game avoids the pitfall of the luck of the draw far more, in my opinion.

I came away quite impressed with Exceed. In the realm of two-player dueling games, this is one of the best. I would have appreciated some more restrained artwork, especially with the female characters. Still, it recreates the rhythm of fighting video games with surprisingly light rules.

I love the direction Level 99 is going with their character designs. Without overwhelming the game with tokens or new mechanics, they manage to keep each character's play style unique and interesting in their own way.

See the first box of Season 1.
This box contains great characters. Satoshi is allows you to make fantastic but requires carfeul preparation combos and is a great technical character to play. Mei Lien becomes interesting when you get used to the syste. Baelkhor and Mortahi are not as strong, in my humble opinion, as some other characters, but are a blast to play.

The Exceed system is one of the best I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Fast, hard-hitting, and brutally immediate. In a lot of ways, I like this even more than the BattleCON system. Though I wish some of the art weren't so, um, tasteless.

Note that my rating is for the system as a whole. I've mixed the characters from different sets and so far none of the characters stand out as exceptionally bad or good, so they all get the same rating.

BattleCon is dead, all hail the new BattleCon!

Seriously, I loved the idea of BattleCon but hated the game itself. My biggest issues were the lack of any randomness, massive AP, and the complicated timing structure of each round. Exceed fixes it all and makes even more improvements.

First is the much-needed randomness. Now instead of having a huge hand of cards that has to be analyzed by both you and your opponent (your hand of cards in BattleCon is essentially open-information), in Exceed you just draw cards from your deck and work with what you have. It's much more tactical and much more satisfying. In Exceed each card now has two different uses so hand management and setting up combos is more important.

The timing structure is much, much better and flows so much smoother in Exceed. When it's your turn to attack you just look for any Before effects, any Hit effects, then any After effects. Then your opponent does the same. No more "beats," no more ante tokens, no more needless complications of BattleCon.

The "timer" has also been improved. In BattleCon you had to remember to advance a timer each round, and if time ran out you would then determine a winner. It was almost impossible to ever remember to advance the timer. In Exceed, if a player's deck runs out for a second time they lose. Very simple, and there's nothing to track.

BattleCon also eventually added rules about using a hit gauge for various effects and different ways to perform your special attack. Exceed simplifies all of that: when you land a hit, you put the card into your "gauge" area. You can eventually spend your gauge to perform your special attacks. It's that simple.

It feels like Exceed is what they originally wanted in this system but they just didn't know how to make it work, so we had to suffer through BattleCon until the system could be refined. I'm glad they finally got through the rough draft, because now we have a really good game. Can't wait to try the other Exceed fighters.

Strictly worse than BattleCon, which it strongly resembles.

Exceed has players drawing a hand of cards from a deck that mixes character-specific and generic actions/attacks. This means that there's less depth of strategy. There's less distinction between characters than BattleCon, it's harder to learn character decks and harder to predict your opponent's actions. 

Moreover, the need to keep drawing cards adds a fiddly hand management mechanic and slows down the game. Although Yomi, which we also own, has hand management, the combo mechanic makes this much more interesting.

In short, we'd keep this game if we owned neither BattleCon nor Yomi, but - as we do - we'd rather play one of those games.

Review copy. Appears to be an attempt to make a more straightforward, easily expanded BattleCON sequel.

Don't know if this is any good, have not yet played.  But the packaging is terrible and the rule book just as bad.

Attempts to be Urban Sprawl: The Dice Game but lacks most of the interesting decision making. There are moment when the game can feel fun but for the most part it's just uninteresting dice rolling that limits your decisions.

Played what i think is a near final version at GMT West fall 2016.. so going to give it a rating.  I was really excited to give this a go, and while this isn't a bad game, was underwhelmed after 2 plays.  First off the two player game has a bot player... which isn't competitive and is just there to mess with the players a little bit (blah).  The 3 player game was better, but even in 3 players the game does drag a bit since this is a Yahtzee game with a bit more depth (don't think i would want to play with 4).  The river (trees) doesn't seem like a viable option since if you attempt to go that route, it will eat up a ton of your dice... making you less equipped to compete in the main city building.  Also not sure if I like how the scoring round is triggered... since it gives way too much flexibility to the player who triggers the scoring round on the rank track (which can score a TON of points for being first).  Would play again, but not something I need to run out and buy.

Final Copy Comments:
The game does play better than the prototype did, and while 4p is definitely the most interesting way to play, you have to be willing to deal with the down time.  The competition in the 4p game makes the game very tense.  Upped my rating to a 6.

Build your city and score points using dice which are rolled up to three times like in King of Tokyo or Yahtzee. You have to balance two score markers since your lower one will be your end score (Knizia style). 
Playing time is a little bit long for what it is, nevertheless a nice puzzling game.

RATING: 4
Welcome to Centerville is a game of plate spinning, allowing players to choose which plates to prioritize and then letting the dice fly. The roll-freeze-roll mechanic, while appropriate for lighter fare, fails to satisfy, and the Master tiles do not compensate. The races for public office is certainly the game's strongest feature, but the other mini-games feel rudimentary. Worst of all the game  overly advantages players who end each round. If a player is able to end the round, or play just prior to round-end, they will very likely score higher points than the other players. This aspect of luck is mostly irremediable, but crucial to success.

I hope Knizia gets a thank-you in the credits; this game is obviously, massively, almost obnoxiously "inspired" by Ra Dice. 

It's somewhat more convoluted and luck-driven than its predecessor neither of which is a particularly good thing. There's pretty much no reason to play this if Ra Dice is available. And if it isn't, well, maybe not even then.

A common criticism I see lobbed against games is that it "feels like you're playing a spreadsheet". I've always thought that criticism was strange because a lot of those types of games I get deeply into the theme and while there is cube pushing and track adjustment, for me it all makes sense and a world is still created from some pretty mathematical and optimization ideas. "Welcome to Centerville" is the first game I've played in a while where I feel like this is nothing but a obtuse spreadsheet with not-so-great GMT-commissioned artwork adorning it all.  So dry, so mechanical, so cold. Usually these things don't bother me, but in Centerville it really did. Nowhere did I feel the building of a city. It was literally placing cubes on a board and pushing them around and being asked to believe that the theme was there. And the dice just add a bowl of luck that I found irritating. Again: quite an odd reaction I found myself having as I don't necessarily dislike dice games (even ones that take a big risk in using Yahtzee-style mechanics to drive the game play). Almost everything about this game I didn't like. What I did appreciate is the complexity is there and it does, by golly, it does "work". My hat off to Chad Jensen there because he is a quality designer and Dominant Species will forever be in my Top 10 games of all time. But Centerville works as if an accountant with a dream made a prototype for a board game and it didn't really get much more developed beyond that point but made it into a box anyway.  Don't get me wrong: I don't mean by "undeveloped" that it is unbalanced. I must reiterate that I give lots of praise to Jensen and GMT for balancing this game in the face of the luck of dice and whatnot. But its so dry and calculating that I'm not really quite sure where the fun is. And 4-player games of it is really too much downtime. I could have seen myself enjoying this much more even with 3 players. Oh well!

Overall gameplay was good. There is tension in building up each section of the city and competing for first/not-last. There are also a few long term strategies you can go that require build up to gain a lot of points. Also hidden endgame majoirty goals that affect everyone and each person knows one

Not sure if the double point (prestige/coin, take the lowest) system was needed, added a bit of complexity and spreadsheeting to the game as you needed to evaluate your actual score throughout the game and what you were going to achieve at the end.

My main knock on the game is the length of time for a game driven by dice. While there is usually something you can do with the dice, the random time element of it drove this game to be about twice as long as it was advertised. We just got unlucky (lucky?) but this is something that could happen in any game. I think a better way to do it, if they wanted to include variable end of round timing, is to always lower the time by 1 and have 1 dice that could roll an extra time.

I bumped my rating from 7 to 8 after 3P and 4P games.  Have now played it all player counts. It was good at 2P but excellent multiplayer. Plays fast. The player aid may be the best ever made. Could teach the game only from the player aid. Small footprint with a lot of game play in it.

A fun game that is much longer than most dice games, but quicker than most city builders.  Luck is a factor, but that can be effectively mitigated by strategic play and taking advantage of unexpected opportunities.  Watch out for that crazy final scoring!

probably one of the heaviest versions of the yahtzee mechanic ive played.  trouble is it's still fundamentally driven by those dice, and some results are just way better than others.   it's an ok mechanic for a shorter game but this actually goes quite a while with 4 players.  many of the actions are taking away directly from other players.  i prefer a little more subtle interaction in my area control

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Played the nearly finished prototype at GMT West and was uncertain what to think. I'm largely tired of the Yahtzee mechanic of three rolls and this one centers around that dice mechanic. With several options to choose from the die faces, there can be some down time in between turns. It appears to be fairly important to at least compete to some degree in claiming city zones if you choose to focus on one of the other couple primary ways to score points. Rules are straightforward. The two player game involves a bot player which also generally is not something I enjoy but it is needed to mix things up and create a bit of chaos/uncertainty in a two player game (the bot is generally not competitive as the two of us scored 40-50 more points than the bot). Your final score is the lower of two final values between prestige and profit.

A pretty strong dice game, and I don't like dice games.  Borrowing the theme and iconography of his previous behemoth Urban Sprawl, Chad Jensen has made a light/medium approachable city-builder with some hard decisions and some hard luck.  Clever and fun.

RATING: 7.7
Tentative rating after one incomplete 3p game.  The game is much longer than the advertised 40-80 minutes -- even with a fast playing group expect your first game to run over 2 hours.  Good GMT quality production values elevate the enjoyment of this game.  Yahtzee type game, I would describe it as King of Tokyo with more options and without the all vs one aspect of King of Tokyo (I personally like King of Tokyo).  It is also like a much lighter version of games like Troyes (another game I like), where the manipulation of the dice offsets the luck element.  You have enough options that whatever you roll is more similar to drawing a hand of cards than rolling dice.  Nice level of interaction between players, does not feel MPS even though one could potentially play it more like an MPS puzzle.  I think it is an excellent game that fills a niche in a collection -- a dice chucking game that I can see playing faster with repeated plays.

A lot less random than urban sprawl. Better scoring design in my opinion. Feels a little bit like Ra the dice game, yet different in so many ways that I can see its appeal as a dice-driven city building themed game.

I like it after the first play.  Very much like an Urban Sprawl light.  A ton of ways to score, and it is not always clear at the start which path to follow.  Some random events and nasty smacks in the face typical of a Jensen game, which I love.  The guy is a favorite of mine.  Took us much longer to play than expected, but if you get into min/maxing turns it can slow you down with the counting.

Final New game of the year and I am super mixed on this. I really like what was going on in this game. Right off the bat I was like wow this is awesome. As the game went on, it was clear that there was a very big runaway leader problem and there was nothing we could do. Knowing what I know now, I wonder how that will change for my next play. Interested in playing again.

Homage to Ra Dice. Brilliant meeting of minds, Chad Jensen meets Knizia. A bit more complex than Ra Dice, in a way to improve the old classic. Very good game for 'roll & spend dice' lovers. Excellent components, the tight map, the rounded corner counters, the colorful dice. Some clever touches enhance the theme, for example the different bonus tied to the offices (control the fire dpt. be immune to disasters, become the mayor to reach max status, and so on).

[playtester] Relatively easy game to learn, yet has a lot of decision trees with each roll of the dice (not only are you evaluating what you want to do, but also what your opponents have done).

There are a plethora of clever design elements (e.g., the Park Bench) which keep the game from becoming a Yahtzee-fest. 

The flow and pacing are excellent.

Just a ton of fun, one of my top 'Most Wanted' releases - highly recommended!

I am not big on dice games, this one has a boring Yahtzee mechanic, and the stickered dice are worrisome, but I hope this has interesting decisions.

The long wait (currently projected at 8 months past the initial publication date) is frustrating and I am losing interest in this game.

Finally received the game 10 months after the initial projection. There is no dice mitigation, so players are at the mercy of their rolls. It can be hard to balance your money and prestige if the dice don't roll your way. So far I have seen huge differences in scores and i am not sure it is due to game play. However, the game is quick and there are interesting decisions if you like push your luck.

Streamlined "Urban Sprawl". Not a masterpiece, but however a solid dice game, which is not too much dependent on luck. Suffers if some players are AP-prone, so try to speed up the decision-making or the game will grind to a halt.

Yahtzee variant city builder with some meat. Area control of the public office positions, area majority with buildings in the equally divided four districts of the city, set collection of academic areas of study, jockey for status, and contribute to the green belt in exchange for prime real estate. Built in timer rolling hourglasses is clever. I like the cross illustration of dice faces. I really enjoy Mr. Jensen's game style and the decisions this game creates plus I am a sucker for dice...a guilty pleasure. Victory goes to the player with the highest score in the lowest rank (money and renown) encourages balanced growth which I also like in games. Stickered dice is a bit of a bummer if this is final version. A GMT P500 game that I hope is a go for launch.

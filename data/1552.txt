I believe the ccg aspect of this game ruined it for me. I&#039;m as paranoid as the next guy (who like big brother is watching all that I type) but I think it simply would be better in a non-ccg format. The artwork was sort of juvenile.

Would like to find a few cards to complete the Limited Edition and Unlimited Edition sets I have and have some Unlimited Edition cards to trade that are in Like New condition (never played); will also trade other games I have for the INWO Unlimited Edition cards I need.

Will buy lots as well as individual cards until I complete the sets I want for my 3 nephews and myself.

Acquired several sets of cards from a co-worker who was selling off some of his games.  Tried to teach this to family members, but it never caught on--preferred the non-collectible version, as the constant self-modification of the game was too confusing.  Also, never had more than 3 players at most.

Was fun when it came out, don't like the ccg part anymore though.  There ended up being lots of modifiers to apply in combat, which made it a bit hard to track for casual gaming.  We used chits on the cards to make it manageable.

This CCG was an improvement over the regular card game - Illuminati.

Once I figured out how to employ card advantage and other strategy card game techniques to win this my opponents lost interest in playing this which was otherwise a diplomatic card game.  So just as it began to be some fun for me it stopped being for everyone else.

My preferred Illuminati format: the math is simpler, and the card game mechanics work better here. Collectible, but it's cheap enough now that this doesn't bother me. They also published the main set in "One With Everything" format, which makes collecting trivial.

RATING: 5
Update:  Discovered that there's a solo variant.  This might be what it takes to get me up to speed on the game, so I can teach it to others.  :)

I have the factory set (aka "One With Everything").  I don't know if I've ever played it.  Keep thinking I'll brush up on the rules and try to teach my wife how to play a simplified version to see if she likes it, but I haven't gotten around to it.  Update:  dropped rating because I'm intimidated enough by the rules that this may never hit the table again.

Steve Jackson Games LCG 2-player version of Illuminati (also the company's foray into CCG.) The "One Big Deck" rules make it the best option for 2-player Illuminati.

General thoughts on Illuminati:

"From years of gaming, Illuminati, in the totality of it's releases and variants, is the only game I have returned to. Can't get better subject matter or mechanics. It all but forces reflection on and conversation about modern western society. Should be far more popular than it is. The original 1987 deluxe edition could seriously stand a reprint (with the original art, which makes it far more accessible than the much more aggressive and less playful later Deluxe, Bavarian Fire Drill, Y2K, Mutually Assured Distraction and INWO.)"

Great genre and a neat little game that unfortunately gets bogged down with the vast amount of text on nearly every card. I didn't play the game enough to get to memorize what every card does, so every game would stall reading the novel on every card that was played.

Although I didn't play the game ( I prefered the original Illuminati to the CCG), the artwork and flavor text made it a great item to peek through every so often. However, when a good offer came my way, I sold my copy (of the "One with Everything").
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
In its original form, this is an excellent CCG. Fun to play, reasonably easy mechanics (for a CCG, anyway), and a rarity collation that doesn&#039;t reward deep pockets make this a fun pasttime. Rules lawyers and an overactive fan base have made this game all but unplayable in its current form, however.

Much better than the boxed original, in which money was fiddly and exacerbated the "A+B fight = C wins" dynamic. Probably would have been better still as an LCG or simple boxed game LCG rather than a CCG, though the deck-building was fun.

Yes.

I the CCG version over OWE. Even though OWE does avoid the trite combos and same old cards we see every game, there just isn't enough strategy unless you build your own deck. 

Now if each player had his own OWE, that might be a game.

Collectible card game

Idea:
- Pregame try to build deck that has some nice theme and power to take control over other Illuminaties. 
- Two decks (group-artifacts and events)
- Each round play series of actions to take control of new groups or artifacts.

To whom
Games take loads of time, each player more or less needs own cards or combined pool of cards. Gets somewhat expensive due that. See also noncollectible version of Illuminati.

RATING: 1
Not something that I would want to play anytime soon. It's by Steve Jackson. I don`t really enjoy his games personally. His games are mostly card games. Not into card games that much, but there are some exceptions.

It's simply not my kind of card game. It doesn't really impress me at all. You have to buy lots of boosters to have something interesting deck wise. Especially in order to have the same card family.

It's very doubt full that I would replay this game any time soon to see if my opinion changes.

It doesn't really hold my interest. There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time. Why would you spend time playing a bad game when you can play a game which is more worth your time and enjoyment?

Don't plan to plan Illuminati: New World Order any time soon.

SOLD IT.

Mediocre.  Of course I had to buy this when it first came out!  It was from SJG, it was Illuminati, and it was collectible, just like the hot new game, Magic: the Gathering!  Funny how a few years can turn three good reasons for buying a game into three big strikes against it.

I like the idea of this, I think: Illuminati as a CCG.  But something about this game never grabbed me and inspired me to make decks; I just wasn't seeing any sub-themes to get excited about.  Not only that, but I already have trouble finding an audience for Illuminati, and expecting them to invest in deck-building is a stretch.  Of course, there's the possibility of creating a UFOs deck, a Gnomes deck, etc, but I wasn't so intrigued that I wanted to buy that many cards.  The cardstock and lamination, incidentally, were not my favorite, although it was nice to use cards larger than my thumbnails to play the game.

Fnord. INWO was SJG's attempt to try using one of its best-known franchises to cash in on the CCG craze of the 90s. We played it for a while, and then it went the way of its predecessor - the games took too much time and weren't all that interesting once the novelty wore off.

This CCG was a good game, but had some flaws.

Like some CCGs, it could often become a race between the decks, rather than a game against the other player.

Also the cards are now often dated in subject (especially personalities,) and the fact that every card has a special rule (often effecting other cards) begins to slow the game badly at times.

A group of us came to this CCG late enough in the game that we were able to pick up LOTS of cards cheap - enough to be able to build some pretty cool decks. 

What kept me from playing the game much is that the deck-building aspect took some players so long... and meant that what should have been 90 minutes of fun turned into 3 hours of pain.

I still think this is better than the original game, though much more complicated to explain.

A complex yet excellent card game. Deriving heavily from the board game, it goes even further and play is limited only by the luck of the draw and the cards you have. Not a favourite game to deck build, most fun is had with all players drawing from a stack of cards (draw 2 discard one usually works).
Twisted, irreverent and ripe for backstabbing!

Would rather play Deluxe Illuminati.  I can see the appeal if you are creating decks to compeat against other players who constructed decks.  I have the "One with Everything" deck and when we played everybody drew off of the same deck.

Old-school take-that mechanics. Humor is a big part of the game's appeal, though much of that humor is geting dated with each passing year. I find that this CCG version plays quicker than the original version of the game, provided you design some decks with cards that work reasonably well together.

Usued to be *alot* of fun back when I first played it because of things like the Boy Sprouts attacking to destroy Texas with the help of the South American Nazis.

Played this five player, at least two of who would be technically described as "Slow as".  This dragged on, and I do mean dragged, for over 3 hours.  I had sat out of Empire at Arms because it was going to take too long.  It bloody finished first.  The game is nice, but the flood of plots make it too chaotic and I year for classic Illuminati even with that hideous midget paper money

In the early nineties The Secret Service tried to stop this game from happening through a raid...they failed. We love this game, one of our gaming group even got the "Servants of Cthulhu" Cyclopean skull tattooed on his inner forearm. If you have played the game you'll know why...the fact that the SoC can still win the game even after destroying themselves is true Azethoth-tech. It even has cards depicting  "Hitler's Brain" and the "Necronomicon" just buy it already.

This captures a lot of the flavor of the original game without the hassle of accumulating Mega-Bucks.  Of course, it's a CCG, so it may take some money to get a deck on par with your fellow players, but the money differential doesn't seem to be nearly as large as that for Magic:  The Gathering and many other CCGs.  After all, it's meant to be a funny send-up of various institutions and personalities.  The artwork and flavor text can provide a good deal of enjoyment on their own.  It's too bad that the game didn't get long-lasting, phenomenal success, but too many expansions probably would have made the game stale and less imaginitive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like the humor in the cards and the illustrations match very well.  I like the fact that you can buy the whole set at once and don't have to spend a fortune on packs or rare cards on Ebay.  You really just have to seek out the promos.  The card quality itself is not the best but since the game has been in print a long time it's easy to replace them.  I like collecting them more than playing. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.1
I'm particularly fond of the original Illuminati, but for the experienced Illuminati player, this game provides a tremendous amount of variation.  The New World Order cards are confusing at times, but can be quite beneficial to the hardcore player.  The cards are very nicely done, and the selection is amazing.  The "One With Everything" rules are a modification off the original game, so that everyone can play off the same communal plot and group decks, but a few cards must be removed to make this effective.  As a whole, it's a good variation on the original, but it takes a little getting-used-to time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The rules are too complicated, and there are too many special abilities, but the gameplay and theme are both pretty good. For actual gameplay it would have a higher rating, but the rules being too complicated really gets in the way, and I'm not a huge fan of the artwork.

RATING: 7
The title looks inciting for international consipracy, especially when you are into spy and espionage. The set has so many cards that may have a lot of interesting combinations.  The story may not be made up very well though.  One weakness you can find so common in a Steve Jackson game.

After reading the rules, however, I find that the game rules are well written more than I expected and the story is plausible enough.  The game tries to simulate what might have been happening in actual world with all the secret societies building up their own power structures on earth in an attempt to control the whole world. Each secret society has its own hidden agenda and there are also regular goals (the controlling of certain no. of powers) to attain.  Either way, you might need to find partner to "share" the control of the world when winning the game, as it is quite difficult for any single player to control the world alone.  The rules are simple and easy to learn. The game serves what it intends to do and reflects the core realities about the secret societies. The interaction among the various factions should be exciting and fun as everyone is trying to outwit the others by recruiting all the factions attached to your opponents, sometime one at a time and sometime a large chunk! Following the movie Angels and Demons, we are going to organize multiplayer games. It is both fun and exciting, inspiring experience, probably underrated by the grognards because of its card mechanics on the surface.     

The "One with Everything" is quite a different game and system than the original one in that the income concept was completely eliminated.  Instead, action token is placed on each group for performing attack action.  Attack to neutralize was also abandoned with attack to control and destroy remain.  

The fun part comes from the narrative coming from the combination of the cards.  Say, when you have Nancy Reagan controls Ronald Reagan, the control power is increased by 10...:)  


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A game that tries hard to be impossible to play. All rules seem to be streamlined to hinder flow of play and ease of use. Goes well with the theme I guess. And theme there is heaps. Despite the total mess that serves as rules, this is still fun to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I wanted to enjoy this game so much, but it was just broken right out of the box. To actually have a playable game, you first need to eliminate the "Automatic Takeover" rule, a stupid rule that defeats the entire purpose of the game (imagine if, in Magic, once per turn you could just put any creature card into play without having to pay its casting cost. That's the Automatic Takeover.) I don't doubt there's variant rules out there that make the game fun, but as is, I can't see working too hard at it when there's always the original game, which works just fine.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.7
So many caveats on this one!  It's very dated ('90s references aplenty), we don't play it as a CCG, we play it two-player with lots of rules alterations, and we introduce elements of randomness that alter the dynamic of this game.  We've really made it our own.  But, all that said, it's so much fun, and one of my favorite games to play.

It's kinda unwieldy and takes up a lot of table space, but the design is pretty great despite the untimely quality.  It's complicated, but not that hard to learn if you pay attention.  And the element of alliances, wheeling and dealing, and backstabbing come into play when you have more than two players.  This is just a personal fave.

Made some improvements on the original Illuminati.  In particular, money is gone, and power can be spent on defense.

Never played it as a CCG but with a Factory set or two is a great big deck game.  Incredibly fiddly however as every cards changes the rules, which is the great and horrible part of the game.  Some players will dismiss it as unbalanced, but it might have been the most balanced CCG that I have ever played.

This rating for INWO plus the base game.
Good with the right players. I have the "modern" reprint which is compatible with INWO. The basic game is repetitive, and can take too long. However, with seeded cards from INWO there is enough variability to make it interesting.
The problem is keeping the base draw-deck balanced while varying the additional cards- there needs to be lots of preparation.
The cards themselves are great - fantastic art and some very good jokes. I used a scan of /The Weird Turn Pro/ as my desktop background for ages.

The only way this can reasonably hit a table is if you play a one-deck variant, where all players draw from the same deck. If you're like me, and have the 'one with everything' set, that's your only option. If you streamline the deck properly (make certain there are far more groups than any other card type, and probably get rid of disasters while you're at it), it works pretty well. You play this game for the theme, and for the sentences you have to say when group X tries to snag group Y, assisted by group Z.

It's fun, but it just takes far too long.

Traded this for a copy of Time's Up!

Worth getting just to read the cards.  The game itself is quite fun, but the learning curve (as with most CCGs) and slow opponents (new players, especially, tend to take a while calculating all the +/- 4s) are negatives, and degenerate decks can turn it into multiplayer solitaire.

Several cards in the limited edition were broken and needed serious revision. Also somewhat ruined by some degenerate cards in the Assasins expansion. This game had some lively online support, another first for me when it came out.

This is broken with constructed deck, if you're playing with "must always win" rules-lawyers types.  But for casual play, I love the interesting deck construction possibilities.  The "One Big Deck" rules with the factory set are fun with a large enough group, but the game can drag on in this case (unless someone gets lucky and crushes everyone).

I think Steve Jackson did a good job of keeping the flavor of the original Illuminati while redesigning the rules for the CCG era. Unfortunately, I don't own enough cards to win against players with larger collections.

Played this a few times, but it was a while go. I have little recollection of the gameplay, but I do remember that I enjoyed the original Illuminati more. It's still Illuminati, so it's a good concept, but I miss the money. In any case, just because it's a CCG means there's a chance I'll never play it again.

I have the factory set, but the one time I actually played was with a deck designed by a friend. It's an okay game, plays faster than the original Illuminati game but has the annoying CCG spend-your-money mechanic that unbalances the game.

Illuminati is my favorite of Steve Jackson's games. Mostly due to the fact that I played it so much when I was younger. We came back to this a few weeks ago (the CCG version though) and it is just as fun as I remembered. It isn't a game I want to play all the time or anything, but it is something I could play every once in a while. 

I want to pick up the boxed game and expansions now.

CCG version of the updated classic world domination game. Many more groups, people, places, and things. There's a lot more going on here than in the previous versions. New economics (no more money) and you play a set up deck against those of your opponents. If you like that sort of thing, this game is great.
I don't. I ended up adapting the gameplay (the power tokens) and components into a home grown version of the original game, significantly expanding it. My gaming group plays these house rules - but we're also a bunch of older Grognard types who aren't really into the collectible deck games.
Still, good stuff. Rating is for the game my way.

This is the best, deep CCG.  Has aspects of classic games such as Cosmic Encounter, Diplomacy, and the original Illuminati.
And it's twisted, weird, and very funny.  But it does take time and you have to pay attention to what influences what.  
Deck building is the most fun of any CCG.

I lost this one in a flood. I liked it but none of my friends wanted to play it. I HATE the CCG/LCG format. Luckily this one had the one with everything box so it kind of alleviated that. It has the same types of pitfalls other SJ Games have such as people all picking on the early leader so the person who helps the least in taking them down wins.

The card drawings are funny, the quotes/descriptions are great, and the game is perfect!
Planning your own schemes to take over the world only to see your secret plans thwarted over and over again. There is no perfect deck. Everything can be countered and a lot of your plans will until you reveal the that final trick that baffles your opponents and you claim your rightful position as world leader.

My absolute favorite iteration of this theme. So many clever plans to put in motion, so many variables to think about. The game isn't only enjoyable in the deck-building phase; the game-play is also very good. Assassins was *not* a good expansion (well, maybe 20% of it was).

I must find a one-deck, deal and play variant that I like for this, as it's really a tremendous game that deserves more play. Seems like a "cube" idea would work decently (maybe with hidden illuminati while drafting, to prevent really obvious counterdrafting).

I like this game, although many of my gamer friends are not fans.  It's a much cheaper CCG than Magic: The Gathering.  The rules can be cumbersome when you get into the game.  The basic rules aren't too tough, but nearly every card changes the rules in some manner.  If you're able to learn and remember all of the useful abilities on the cards, the results are very rewarding in game play.  More than anything, it's a fun game.

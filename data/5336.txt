GAME: Talisman (third edition)
RANK: 2452
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Easy to learn and play.

Cards are a bit small as is the writing on them.

Still a good game to play.

Playing the base games is better than playing with the expansions.

The expansions clutter the playing area and drag the game out longer.

Per me è stato il gioco più bello e divertente degli anni '90, quando si giocava a un tipo diverso di giochi rispetto a quello attuale. Era bello esteticamente, facile e appassionava tutti. Ho giocato una dozzina di volte intorno al 1996. Ho le tre espansioni.

RATING: 6
I remember many very long games of this in our old house in Canterbury. A bit dated now, since its really a case of everyone playing their own game and other people waiting for their turn, which can be a drag if there's five or six of you!

Trade Info. It's not in great condition, a couple of the figures are painted inexpertly and the Goblin fanatic is missing (i.e. in my Blood Bowl team)

It is otherwise complete, playable and has the first two expansions (though these are not in their own boxes, but in the main box.

RATING: 7
I played 1st (maybe 2nd, not sure) edition in college and loved it.  Was disappointed to learn it was out of print.  When 3rd edition came out I bought it instantly.  I had lots of fun with 3rd edition and it is very much a viable game, but the "craft" element is too limited in 3rd edition and the Wizard character is at a huge handicap.

Fun but need improvement. Mainly the mid game and game time, get dull easy.

RATING: 4
A major problem is that at any level, you can be attacked by any level monster.  It's easy to die, then instead of being eliminated, you reset -- similar problem in Munchkin.  Takes [i]WAY[/i] too long to play.  :P

RATING: 1
A friend set this up, me being new to it.  Everyone else in the room groaned. One player pointed out how the game was broken: that the player who by chance gets this one super card wins, regardless of everyone's play. He went on to get that card and won, leaving the table grumbling that he'd wasted his time better spent elsewhere.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game fixes a lot of problems with the old game, but adds a lot of its own too. There are fewer options per location and card (thereby reducing the already low strategic elements). Some of this is made up for by making it easier to get to the other boards when you feel you're ready. The art is god awful, nothing like the wonderfully evocative Gary Chalk art of the original game. Can we say "skull fetish"? :P

I have all three expansion sets. I also have all the extra characters that were printed in the Games WorkShop magazine along with the corresponding pewter figures. I enjoy playing this game, although it has lost a little luster over years. I find that it takes too long to play, and the rules and monsters just don't scale well with the leveling player characters.

The "watered down" version of Talisman.  More like "Talisman Light."  I don't tend to play it, but occasionally it gets requested.  And then I get to show off the minitures my friend painted.  I have a gay wizard (^_^)

Would have gotten a 5, but I have two expansion sets which improve it somewhat.  I'll probably dust this one off when I have children.  Not really an engrossing game for adults.

RATING: 1.5
Roll and move YUCK!  This is a complete waste of time and money.  I do give it a half point for some cool artwork.  This game just did not work for me.  It was an endless series of almost meaningless die rolls that never "captured" my imagination.  If you are looking for a fantasy world that works and is playable within three hours look for Prophesy.

The simplest of any fantasy themed boardgame. It's just roll and move and the luckiest adventurer wins. It's mind boggling when I think about the fact that 15 years ago I actually thought this was a pretty good game. It drags on, there are no meaningfull desisions to be made and it's just plain boring. Components are rather nice. Ok to play once every ten years or so.

This was one of my favorite games for a long time, despite the downtime and the number of 'do nothing' turns that can take place.  It's full to pull out once in a while, and a good game to play with non-gamers as the mechanics are dead simple.

My tastes have changed, so it normally only comes out now when we're overcome by waves of nostalgia.  That feeling could just be stomach cramps though...

Whilst still a fun dungeon bash, this edition of Talisman is much poorer than the original version IMO. It's let down by it's ridiculously large retail price, the quality of some of the components, and by a number of irritating errors.

RATING: 5.8
Talisman is a great introduction to people who think of Monopoly and Clue when board games are mentioned.  Unfortunately, while I enjoy the game, I do not feel it is quite so amazing in its third iteration.  These days, when people mention Talisman, they often think of Second Edition, and following that, the more recently released Fourth Edition from Fantasy Flight Games.  There's a reason for this:  In this, the Third Edition, the artwork, the streamlined rules, the simplified characters and even the end game all fall horribly flat.  The game still plays well, and is an enjoyable experience, but it doesn't feel quite as epic as it could.

Light hearted and fun pseudo-RPG.  I think Runebound may have filled this slot for me, but I still love this game.  They each have their own selling points.  Talisman is probably easier to approach for the beginner.  Makes a good gateway drug to Runebound, which can take you to Warhammer Quest, and finally D&D!  Full Conversion!  ;)

I like it. Interesting to think about the various versions, advantages of each.

RATING: 6
The worst version I've seen, since they replaced the final dungeon from 2nd edition with a boring pile of nonsense. They thankfully came to their senses in 4th edition and brought it back. That's the one you'll want to get, seeing as Fantasy Flight took the reins and added tons of quality expansions and piece count.

It was fun the first few times, but it's definitely too long of a game.
Some people get bored, everytime, because you just want it to finish and it won't since it's mostly luck-based.
I don't play it anymore.

Quite different to both 2nd edition and its successor the 4th edition, slightly more dumbed down rules and mechanics, presumably to appeal to wider market. Still a lot of fun, standard dungeon crawler fare.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
One of the first games i played that really drew me into the boardgaming scene. Would probably have rated this higher after the first few plays, maybe an 8 or so. But the gameplay gets quite dull after you know all the cards. There is also a big luckfactor. The game feels totatlly random at times and is more about the luck of the draw. I rate this a 6 although i wont suggest playing it myself unless i buy an expansion or upgrade it to the new edition, wich is highly unlikely at the moment as there are many better games that deserve my attention.

Great game with great friends.  Nostalgia definitely a factor here.  Light fantasy game, but worth digging out a few times every year.  Add the Dragon's Tower for more fun and danger, but the City and Dungeon expansions can bog down the already lengthy game time.

I prefer 2nd ed, but 3rd ed is not too bad with the expansions.  It plays faster than 2nd ed, but there isn't as much variety.  The rule that allows you to exchange experience points for strength, craft, life or gold is a neat idea and probably speeds the game up.

RATING: 6
Gift from a friend long ago because he knew I liked the OoP 2nd edition. It's okay. I don't like it as well as the previous edition with expansions. It's a game I will often refuse now, but I played it a lot decades ago and my kids had a love affair with it when they first discovered it. Overall, too long and too random for what it is. It shows its age and pales next to more recent games, but it's still an appealing entry game for people looking for certain elements (long, adventure game, light, plenty of take that, Ameritrash)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Not a great game but played with the right group (up for some banter), in the right spirit (of drunkeness and disinterest in victory), this can be an enjoyable way to pass an evening.

I played this game often in college with friends. This version seems to be looked down upon by Talisman fans but I think it plays very well. We made up some house rules to keep someone from winning quickly, so others could "whiffle through the spell deck," in an often vain attempt to stop the leader. Fun stuff.

I recently remembered playing at the end of the 80's what I have learned to be the second edition of this game. Based on the desire to play again I went shopping for Talisman only to discover that it has been out of print for 10 years. Luckily enough, I was able to get a brand new shrink-wrapped version of this much amusing game and we got to play again, for the first time in 15 years. We were four to try out the third installment of Talisman, and I was the only one having played. The comments I got at the end of the game was that it had been much appreciated by all.

A streamlined improvement over the wacky chaos of the 2nd edition - this version manages to have both a (usually) semi-reasonable length and a somewhat exciting endgame. Still not that much in the way of tactics, but a fairly enjoyable romp if that&#039;s what you&#039;re looking for.

I find it hard to believe that this game is ranked as high as it is. It basically consists of roll; move; fight a monster. The first time I played it, I thought that it was OK, but after that it became tedious, to say the least. I haven't played this in years, and don't plan to. I have a couple of friends whose personal hell is probably being forced to play this game ad infinitum. I give it a two because some of the miniatures are pretty nice.

Very light weight Adventuring fun for just the right group. Playable by anyone. And scratched that adventuring itch while staying light and encourages table talk and socializing.  Optimal with 4, playable but slower with 6.  
 
 Get the expansions, especially the Dragons Tower. While slowing the game down a little...add a lot more to the base game.

This version is OOP.

Silly hack and slash fun for people who want to play D&D without a plot or a DM. The artwork is cheesy, but fits the game well. I'll pull this out once or twice a year and enjoy it immensely each time. It's best with the expansions, particularly the dragon tower. the end would be anti-climactic otherwise.

Kinda fun, but this can really draaag.  If it's over 2.5 hours and someone's making a run for the Dragon King, and they play that "kill anything instantly" spell for the win and someone else wants to play the "undo that last spell" spell- nuh uh.  Not at my house.

RATING: 6
My rating should have been two-sided. This is not a game, it&#039;s a temptation. I play it whenever I forget everything about my last game, because the presentation is gorgeous, the premise is everything a fantasy game must be, rich and diversified, but the rules are nonexistent and the gameplay is ridicolous. The game plays on its own, with players as bystanders, dragging along for countless hours. But, man, the miniatures are fantastic, the cards are countless, the board is gorgeous, (snip!) ...

Love the components, got my set entirely painted by a pro!  However, the game play itself leaves more to be desired.  It is mostly a multi-player solitare.  Yet it is fun if you have a few hours to burn and don't have the brain power to burn it.

I have in my collection:

Most fun for three people who are in the mood for a beer and pretzels dungeon crawl.  If more people play it can get a bit bogged down.  With a serious crowd it will also lose some of its charm.

Great theme, but not really a good game. I have heard people say that this is the best Snake and Ladder games and I tend to agree. It doesn't say much though. If I were to convince small children about the greatness of board games, I might want to play this with them. I prefer more strategic games.

Fun with the right group.  Too simple for some, but I'll take this over monopoly any day.  Enjoy the artwork, mini sculpts and personality thrown into this version.

I've only played this recently and maybe that's why I don't want to rate it higher.  This is a simple roll and move game at its heart, but it allows you to attack and kill your friends at the same time.  The playing time is far longer than it should be for this game as well.  Still, it's a fun game to play every few months with the guys and some beers.

I WAS very glad that GW re-released this, I'd been wanting it for a long time. Lots of action and it has a very quick pace. Not much strategy involved, it's basically a very long dice-fest that sometimes never seems to end. An ok family game, but quite expensive. The figures, though plastic, look excellent as you would expect from GW.

RATING: 9
Talisman is a part of my childhood. This game is really unique as it is the only game that fully captures the dungeon-bash experience without the need of a gamemaster. Select your hero, bash monsters, gain experience, grab weapons, beat the dragon and win the game. Every game is unique, and skill/tactics can make up for bad luck. Should defenitly be played with all expansions.

Preliminary Rating (only one play) 6.5 4/22/10

It's almost a '7' for me, but this is definitely an 'in the right mood' game. The game is very luck based, and while it's fun to see how things progress, you don't have much of a chance to have a better strategy win-out.

A fantasy adventure game where player travel the world, fighting monsters to improve their stats. When a player is strong enough, he/she may attempt to slay the dragon king and take control of the crown of commane (thereby winning the game). This game is always fun and unique. You can never be sure that you are safe. The biggest drawback of this game is the length of time required to play. This version has cartoon artwork and doesn't feel very serious. The rules are simple enough for most people to learn easily. The expansion boards are essential.

One of the ultimate board game experiences. The fun part of this game was downloading some of the great expansions that people have created, and adding to the game. Here's a great link site, if you're interested: http://www.talisman.ipcon.de/tldb/links.phtml?caller=2

I will warn you, though, that adding expansions is addictive and causes the game to become very long. My friends and I played it every monday evening for 3-4 hours for a month before someone claimed the Crown of Command!

One of my friends wanted me to add the story of how I cam across my copy of Talisman, so here it is:

My folks and I were heading home from Nova Scotia and we stopped in Moncton (a city in New Brunswick near the provincial border) at a 2nd hand clothing store. I just happened to wander down into a section where they had some books and some kid toys and such, and there it was: the 3rd edition of Talisman. Now, I had played it once at a friend's house (he had borrowed it from a friend of his) and at the comic shop (Strange Adventures) there was one for $139.99 brand new, and I had been debating mentally on purchasing it. And here it was 2nd hand! It was missing one character card (the swashbuckler) and 2 gold pieces. Everything else was there. I did have to buy some speical glue to fix the figures to the stands and fix both the wizard's staff and the goblin fanatic's ball and chain, but I got that at the dollar store. Anyway, here's the sweet part of the story (Those people selling copies for mega moolah, please don't hate me!): I bought it for $1.99.

Canadian.

This is a true story.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun fantasy game. Lots of dice and luck, but from time to time, a mindless adventure game can be a satisfying experience. *** Usually played with the three expansions *** Minor point: the combination of one of the expansion boards and a certain spell can be too powerful.

Lots of broken rules, completely unbalanced characters (e.g. Warrior of Chaos) and now considered more for its collector value than actual gameplay. But you know what? I still love to take that huge box out of the shelf once in a while and get a quick game going. Best at 5-6 players and if you're interested, try to buy the extension (City and Dungeon) as otherwise you'll get bored after 4-5 games (IMHO, the Dragon Tower ext. is not worth if you can get a deal on the whole thing, then go ahead).

Talisman 2nd edition is a game for budding lawyers as it has as many loopholes, need for house rules and a rather muddled end of the game that encourages argument and debate of the rules, this can be highly entertaining. 3rd edition is for kids and is about half as intricate.  The characters now feel generic and though I love Wayne England's artwork, 2nd edition is just better.

2010-05-31: Best edition of Talisman in my opinion: Streamlined rules, faster game, three expansions to add (which I won't do, because in 4 players the base game is large enough).

Roll and move... But it could become much better with 2 changes:

1) Players move by choosing and discarding a card from their hands (3 cards per player should be enough), with each card displaying a number from 1 to 6. Whenever you have to skip your turn, you still earn 1 XP point.

2) Characters level-up with 5 (maybe 4) experience points.

    Well, it's Talisman. A really fun game for the first few times around.  But similar to Days of Wonders games, the amount of luck involved tends to wear thin the enjoyment of playing.  Still, a blast if you enjoy a fantasy based game filled with lots of characters to play, lots of monsters to slay, and a ton of chance encounters.  You really do need all the expansions though.

I hated this game.  My decisions really didn't seem to make any difference.  Roll a die, something bad happens, and you have very little control over any of it.  I realized about an hour into playing it that I could create an AI using a d6 and a coin, and it would have just as much success at winning as I would.  
Anytime someone got close to winning the game, another player would kill them.  When killed, we would be back to square one, so we would try to kill the person that just killed the other person - and so on, and so forth.  
The game lasted 4 hours before we just gave up and put it away.  It was not fun, and that friend has been requested to never bring that game back over again.

Initial rating after one play:

The first time I played this will very likely be the very last time as well, so I'd better give my rating now it's still fresh.

I don't like luck driven games, and this game definitely has too much luck for me. Roll a dice, choose between 2 places where to put your figure. Draw cards, roll another dice to see the effect, etc.
To me it felt like 70% luck and 29% tactics. And maybe 1% strategy. Was nice to be able to play this. Had a reasonable good time playing thanks to a good crowd of 6. Too much downtime anyway with that amount of players.

Played with Dragon's Tower expansion, which only lenghtened the game more, and added more (bad) luck. Nice to have a bit more of 3d element in the game though.

RATING: 4
A failed redevelopment of the superior 2nd edition.  They attempted to water down the characters to create a more level playing field at the cost of gameplay. 

After a 10+ year hiatus from Talisman, I played the latest edition.  The game was changed so much that I consider the latest version a "butchered" version.  I can see that the designers thought to try to balance out the powers of the characters and the lopsidedness given by certain cards (like the horse, the horse and cart, and the warhorse) but in doing so they extricated all the elements that made the game fun.  Plus they screwed with the layout in the inner region.  What an awful remake.  Get the original even if it's in worn condition.  It'll be worth it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Can be a great deal of fun if played with the right group.  This game is not so much about the winning, but the journey to get there.  End game can suffer when someone who tries to finish the final challenges rolls poorly and is set back to almost the starting point.

Break out the booze and snacks and get ready for a VERY fun night. The whole experience, while not directly satirical, feels like one big satire of the genre as the whole, and this comes through in the mechanics as well as the theme.

Found a mint, shrink wrapped copy of this lurking in a local Game store in early 2004.  It was the second edition "slim" box, but still an excellent find.  We've plyed it may times with and without expansions and it still rocks!  A simpler version of the rules than the second edition, but has lost a little of its appeal in the process.  Still a solid 8 in my book.

Acquired a second copy from e-Bay in summer 2004 as part of a "job lot" including all three third edition expansion sets!

Long, luck-based, and unbalanced;  the Knight Templar should be considered a "joke" character where you can demand peoples' watches or something if you actually manage to win with him and his ridiculous "special ability" (used with one...count it, ONE of the 129 adventure cards).

The first hobby board game that really got its hooks into me.  I played it all through college and documented well over 150+ games.  Despite all the hate it gets for being a "roll-n-move" game, I really enjoyed the limitless potential for storytelling it held.  Totally loved playing it, and never minded a defeat - as the journey was what was most enjoyable.

RATING: 6.2
I've become less enamoured of this game over the years as it now feels like "Grind: The Game". Still, it can be good fun and it is very well put together, but there are so many games on my shelves now that are more fun, it just didn't cut it any more. The App version I got really shows how dull it is as a game on its own. Worth it with the right group, but there are now so many better quest games.

This was the game that got me into boardgames.  I bought this and within a few months the expansions.  At the same time, I tried getting into Warhammer fantasy.  Though that failed due to the lack of time and players.  I eventually traded these games into a local store for Warhammer Quest.  After buying this game I decided to purchase two used copies of Heroquest and two expansions.  Sadly over time, these games were resold or traded for other things.

This game has a special place in my heart because it was the first non mass market boardgame I played. It's highly random and goes on far too long. Don't play with more than 4 players though- it will take hours. I'd reduce the Dragon's strength and craft to 10 too.

Got this as a birthday or xmas gift when I was about 10

***Soo much faster than any other edition of Talisman.*******

When I play this, I check out of the competitive mindset.  Then I can thoroughly relax into and enjoy this game. 

Board is constantly changing-played with up to 5 people(better with fewer-3 is prob best). Cool minis & components.  

4/10/13- 3P (with Edwin and Bri) game tonight reminded me why Talisman is so great. And also great reminder why I really like keeping my 3rd ed set even though I have 4th. 3rd is just so easy to plunk down and play with people that haven't experienced Talisman before.

Revised rating down from 6. My original rating was tainted by nostalgia. I have fond memories of playing the 2nd edition in highschool and college. We had all the expansions, and would play this for hours. We LOVED this game. Years went by and I saw the 3rd edition in a store and snapped it up. I never had an opportunity to play it until this weekend, 10 years later, and 1 year after discovering euros. I brought it to a meeting of a local game group, and got 3 stout men to volunteer for a game. We never finished. The entire game was random. The only decision to be made was which way to move after the die roll, and to attack or not. Everything else was decided by die rolls.  I still have fond memories of Talisman, but I can't say I'd play ever again.

A very good, 'old school' game. Totally lucky based, but very fun.
Basic set is a little poor... To improve replayability I downloaded, printed and laminated eight Fan-Expansions from the net (the ones I considered the best ones for artwork and gameplay); now the game is very vast, incredibly various and more difficult (a rate of '9' with them).

The game design is original...it does set itself apart from the typical dungeon crawl game (in that there is no real dungeon!).  My beef is that it is a total luck fest.  There is no tiering to the challenges.  The same challenges can be met in the outer circle as in the inner.  It plays out very slowly at first.  Some of the challenges are ridiculously hard for a low level character.  So depending on what you draw, you could get some serious hurting and not advance. Those who are lucky enough not to draw something too hard, and/or pull a lot of allys/items, gain more experience than the others.  At some point a person hits the point where everything becomes too easy, and their advancement is very fast, while the others are still lingering behind. This is the person who will win the game.  Also, there seems to be some character imbalance.  The more balanced characters were in attributes, the better they seemed to do.  It's fun enough, though, just to see who will come up on top, and who will keep getting smacked down.

Chunky GW art and characters. Skulls everywhere! Chaos horns sprout from everything!

Yes it's the overproduced, giant boxed, heres a few hundred more fiddly bits, version of Talisman.

It...Can't....be...beat.

Super extended extra game boards version with giant cardboard tower and immense plastic dragon on top of it for the win!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Played with [GAMEID=3735], so rated a bit higher.  Cards had poor editing and rules had holes, such that the "most important rule" was included to cope with this!  Unbalanced with "craft" characters making poor progress and once a "strong" character had advanced enough, experience came too easily.  Random character, random movement (single die), random encounters...

Played this once when a friend bought it and all the expansions for a few quid from The Works in Nottingham.

Decent (if overly long and random) fantasy game with all the elements in place. You have a hero with stats that can be boosted. Roll a die and move around the board battling monsters and picking up equipment. Upgrade, find a Talisman, get into the center of the board, complete quests and win.

Sounds easy? Try that with people trying to bash you, depending on die rolls to hit the space you want. It can be fun but equally frustrating. The expansions add more depth and fun to the gameplay...length too.

What can I say that hasn't already been said about Talisman. The third edition "kicked it up a notch" and added higher quality graphics, components, and nicer character sheets.

This was the first edition of "Talisman" I was introduced to.

"Talisman" is my most hated game of all time. How it has persisted for so many years is beyond my understanding.

If you are looking for a light hearted fantasy game, long to the point of being almost grueling and that's part of the fun... then Talisman is for you.  My old roommate hated it, though he would always play anyway and was the victim of all kinds of weirdness, including being killed by environmental conditions at least twice, and a friend of mine from college loved it, probably too much.  Just make sure you've got some drinks when you start... and I mean martinis.

A great game, especially when you have all of the expansions.  Needs 3-5 players to make it interesting, as with only two it can get a bit repetitive.  That said, it is easy to learn and fun to play.

Picked this up at a thrift store, it is in pretty sad shape.  Would love to complete it, please message me if you are willing to part with any of your pieces.  Or I am open to offers to help complete someone else's game.

A buddy of mine has this game and two of the expansions. We have since gathered up all of the expansions for it. It is fun, but way too long.

Before playing Runebound this game was great, now having played Runebound I haven't played this.  This game much like Runebound is good when you want to play an RPG without playing and RPG, just this guy suffers from huge swings of luck.

I took the time to paint up the mini's and love that I did. I would like someone to make cards for the 3rd eddition characters to the new 4.5 when it comes out so I can use the miniatures. Please???

I know it takes forever to play, but I've been playing it since I was in 9th grade, so it holds a special place in my heart.

Initially it is fun.  However, after a few games, you realize there is not much there.  Probably a bit over-hyped due to nostalgia.

For it's time it was nice game and graphics is amazing. I liked it as a kid very much and played very often. However today I rate it more like collector's item than a playable game. Nothing against it but there are thousands better games these days.

I loved my complete 2nd edition set...years after I traded it all away, we played this version...nice update but I wasn't ready to pull the trigger...I'm glad I didn't, because now there's 4th edition, which is very nice

The grand-daddy of all adventure boardgames. The overall experience, not the strategy, is the compelling draw of the game. Lots of bits, lots of luck, but lots of fun. Superb production quality. Nostalgia plays a heavy part in my rating... Compared to more streamlined designer games, it certainly shows its age and may only be a 6 or 7... But the components are still as good as anything you'll see on the market today.

Somewhat fun though, like all these games, there&#039;s about as much strategy as Candyland. Still, chrome and dice can be fun too sometimes.

Talisman is one of those games so intimately related to my youth that's impossible for me to stop loving it. I fell in love with this game 10 years ago and I still want to play, even if everyone else complains about it's tediousness and repetitiveness...

It looks good and I want to like it, but it doesn't work as a game.

I like every single run of Talisman whenever it's being pulled out!

Was rated a 5 but I've removed the rating at protest of Games Workshops appalling treatment of their supporters, fans and the game buying public.

Well my son loves it. We've got the forest and city expansion. There's no exactly a lot of decision making, roll playing or tactics. In fact it doesn't feel much different to Monopoly except at least there's always a winner.

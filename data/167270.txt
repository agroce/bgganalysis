The simplicity of the rules is a major plus - this is not much more complex than Carcassone but it looks fantastic when in play. Works well at 2 player and scales well.

LIKE: competitive and quick. beautiful city being built. careful strategies emerge.
DISLIKE: can be cutthroat. colors of the purple and brown palace are too similar in dark light.
OVERALL: although there is a bit of cutthroat placing, it is a fun game. rewarding finish seeing the city.

1st play: I'm actually quite impressed with this game. Reading the rules I wasn't quite sure what the game would be like, but the experience is good. I like that your buildings can be limited by other players moves and the struggle for various towers and objectives keeps the game going and the battle over steering the merchants toward your palaces is tense. The game is also beautiful when the game is over. 

2nd play: Solid 4 player abstract experience. Lots of room to force other player actions, control zones of the board and fight for the large buildings. It is quick to teach, and there is good depth of play.

Was glad to have chose this game. Understand that it was a reprint with more components. I like how push your luck factor as you have to decide when to claim the different colored buildings PLUS even after claiming you have to minimize the scores of your opponents so that you stand to gain the most.

At the end of each game, you also get to see the final layout of a city built by all the players. This game is deceptively simple but mentally challenging. Very much recommended!

Some tweaks to the rules that are easily ported over to the old version (where my rating sits).

This version is, as far as I'm concerned, inferior to the first version.  Colors, usefullness of the screens, shapes and sizes of the pieces.  I won't play this copy again because of that.

The tweaks to the rules are pretty damn cool.  I may, or may not, use those in future plays.

The game was interesting, until it kept going on forever where people were making turns that couldn't benefit them, but benefited one other player. Terrible idea. Would be an easy fix though if there was some way the game could end early. But the end game for this ruins it for me.

Toujours dans les destinations de vacances, certains sont peut-être allé visiter des Médinas (quartiers genre "vieux Lyon", mais dans les villes arabes). Du coup, ils ont vu plein de beaux bâtiments, plutôt colorés, et parfois même des palais. Et bien, ils vont pouvoir revivre tout ça dans Medina. Jeu de placement et d'opportunisme où on va construire de beaux palais, y mettre des toits, les accoler aux murailles de la ville mais où il faudra les revendiquer à temps. Avant qu'un autre vacancier vous le pique, quoi...

My favorite abstract for exactly 4 people. Simple to teach, but deep in strategy. 2-3p is still good, but the neutral color roofs makes for some cutthroat choices that, IMO, take away from the relaxing gameplay. When the game is over, you've built a little wooden city, which is pretty cool.

Fantastic 2p game of real estate values. Is your property near the markets? Does it have a view of the town square? Wonderfully cutthroat, quick and beautiful. Sometimes you have to take a moment to step out of the intricacies of the game and look at the gorgeous object you've built together on the table.

Played with 4p, not expecting much and it scaled wonderfully. Everyone wants to play again. This is an absolute classic. Thank you Stronghold for bringing this back from before my time!

It's pretty.
It's pretty... simple.

Maybe because it's a re-release of an older game, I should be a little more lenient on it, but this was one of those where I studied the rulebook first, and it seemed intriguing.  For some reason, though, in execution, it left me with a feeling of 'meh'.

That's not to say I wouldn't play it again, but there's a lack of tension despite that the game amounts to a form of 'chicken' in which you are trying to judge who is going to pounce on a palace first.

Despite the wonderful look of all the wooden pieces, this game could easily have been made with simpler components at half the price.  You're paying a lot of money for wood and not so much for game, imo.

At any rate, it's not a terrible game, but it's also nothing to write home about.  This is what you bust out for a quiet evening; as a thinking exercise, Medina serves its purpose well, but retains all the tension of an evening of chess (which I enjoy in the right mood).

This one is a nice looking but ultimately fairly bland area control type game. It feels quite dated and you are very limited on what you may actually do on a turn, a lot of placement is forced placement so some of the decision making is taken out of your hands.

This was a very enjoyable semi-abstract (it does have a theme so shouldn't be considered a true abstract like the gipf series).

I liked the city building, and trying to work out who still had buildings or merchants, and how to start a new merchant line to my advantage.

The tower and other tile bonuses are important.  I only had 1 pt from them, but wound up losing by 1 to another player that got 8 points.  Towards the end of the game you need to try and work out how many additional wall pieces are left and if any of them could cause you to lose/gain a tower bonus.

A very entertaining game in which players build a city together using very nice wooden components. A big element of the game is the timing of when to claim a palace and when to connect a palace to the walls.

It can be a bit cutthroat, but there are always enough alternative options for it not to be too mean. The rules are simple and game flow fast and smooth. And the board looks great once the game is done.

Medina is such a beautiful game and relatively easy to play, but with tough choices to make. One may feel a bit overwhelmed by the number of placement possibilities to start, but you will settle into it quite quickly after a few buildings get placed. The gameplay is easy to pick up after a short while so in the end you are just pushing your luck, keeping the blocking and optimal placement going and hoping your plans work out! This also works a solid 2-player game, which is refreshing.

Set and setting. As Tim Leary once noted the place and position in which one plays can greatly influence one's opinion.  I revisited Medina based on my love for Dorra's designs and was happy to return.  I had previously disliked Medina, but now it appears it was more influenced by the company at the table rather than the game itself.  Medina is a classic design, . . .wonderful game.

You get a lot of wood in the box and it looks really impressive when you begin to construct the city. However,as the board fills up it becomes increasingly fiddly to position the pieces, or to see exactly what is going on.

The game itself is rather is just too dry and abstract for my tastes. Seating order is very important as you are usually waiting on your immediate opponent to make an error.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Finally, after years of waiting, Medina is mine, and it's mine in a new and improved version!  Unlike a lot of abstracts, this is not "five minutes to learn" as the tiles and rules governing the building of palaces take some acclimation for the newly initiated.  It won't go over well with a lot of gamers for this reason, but for those who are willing to explore the possibilities of Medina, a sublime experience awaits.

Interesting game--very devious. Why do anything yourself when you can wait and have your opponents do it for you? Seems the winning strategy is to give the other players impossible choices, sap them of their momentum, and force them to take moves they don't want to. At least this is how I was beaten. :)

Note, many of the copies available in this print run don't have desiccant packets. I bought and returned two copies from Amazon that had significant mold on the pieces. A third copy from the FLGS was also missing the packet and had some mold (but could be passably cleaned).

Playing around with wooden blocks is still fun, and this game has a nicely strategic use for them.

RATING: 10
An amazing game!  What looks very simple and potentially dull turns into a thinky meaty mind grinder by the third turn.  A push your luck area control where the longer you wait, the greater the rewards for claiming a building, but the risk of someone else taking it grows.  Stalling & delaying has great benefits (and risks!) while grabbing a relatively small building allows you to focus on maximizing points and cutting off competition expansion.  Beautiful!.  Lovely 3D look to the city with huge heavy wooden pieces.  Many point paths and sneaky things to do to outwit opponents.  This is a never trade, never sell.

Roughly equivalent to the original, though the rules are vaguely phrased in places and it may be better to play by the first edition rules if you can find them.

Placing any two pieces per turn is reminiscent of Through the desert as are certain other elements.  I think we definitely prefer Through the Desert as a two player game vs this one but Medina has its charms that make it interesting in its own regard.  The pieces and the way they come together on the board are beautiful.  There is a bit of chicken in who grabs which building such that some players may interpret your placements as really mean.  There is zero game without playing this way however as its the entire point.  The system as designed does work fabulously.

Medina is from 2001 and it definitely shows that it's from the pre-Caylus school of boardgame design, in that instead of trying to do a thousand different things, it focuses on one idea and commits to it. You're placing buildings to form palaces, with the intention of claiming the best-scoring palaces. That's it. There are things which affect how much palaces are worth, but it's still all about position, control, and a bit of luck pushing. It's also super attractive. This second edition has a two-player variant that worked just as well as the full four-player version; in fact, it's almost a little more interesting. Really glad I finally got this one.

This is a surprisingly good Euro.  It seems like it would be dull, and is very abstract but the game has real depth.  On your turn you can start a new palace that is in a unique color and has not been claimed, you can expand an unclaimed palace, add merchants to the merchant road, add walls to the city from a tower, or add stables.  Palace and stables score a point for each claimed palace, you will have four in each color and any that border a wall or merchants gain a point.  In Addison you get bonuses for building the biggest palace in a color first or claiming a palace next to walls connecting to a tower and extra points for spaces orthogonally adjacent to a well.

I really like this game. The new Stronghold edition is excellent.  This is a game that might look unimpressive but is stunningly deep

First impression after one 4p game.  A good abstract game with interesting elements of area control, parasitism, leeching, and press your luck.  Elegant rules that are not in the way of playing the game.  Excellent components (heavy wooden blocks).  The rating reflects the fact that although I enjoy abstract games I am less likely to suggest them and that there are other abstract games that I would likely prefer to play first (e.g., Tigris and Euphratis).  My rating will likely change with repeated plays.

Excellent abstract game! I am very picky about the abstracts that I like. I usually don't care for them if they play too long, however this one is different. It does play longer than I would normally want an abstract to play, but not too long in general. I just LOVE the building aspect of the game. I don't know of another game that gives me that sense of accomplishment like Medina. I can sit back and look at our creation and smile. It just looks so good when you're finished. 

It can be a little fiddly placing the pieces (like the game Operation) especially towards the end of the game. But a very minor quibble. There is a lot of strategy and tactics mixed in with this game. Zero luck involved. A good handful of interesting decisions, but not overwhelming either. Very interesting play and beautiful to look at when done. Highly recommend!

Do you keep buildings open and go for as many points as possible hoping that you capitalize on it before someone else or do you take what you can get and hope that someone else doesn't run away with things in the end.

Beautiful and elegant game.  I like the push your luck element.  It can be quite challenging to work out what to do - especially at the beginning before people start claiming buildings.  This game gets bonus points for being quite strategic yet having a short play time (usually one hour is long enough).

Very middle-of-the-road, very 'meh' game. I'm finding that even though I do enjoy building things in games, I enjoy building engines more than physical displays. Medina is simply a game that gives you just enough rules to build a collective series of wooden buildings and things. The whole game of chicken that revolves around the buildings is too fast and loose for my tastes, and the game almost requires you to play it a few times before you "get" how you're supposed to play. I got a similar feel from Amazonas. I don't know...I thought Stefan Dora was a designer I enjoyed, but it seems like every board game he designs is mediocre, while his card games are excellent.

The concept of building own buildings and stealing other players' buildings sounds very intriguing. Add to that a visually appealing game as the city slowly arise in front of your eyes and you have an irresistible game.

Pretty great visually with all the pieces placed on the board, and multiple paths to scoring give you a lot to think about.

Addition of the well in the Stronghold version add some nice impetus for placing pieces away from the walls, and the two-sided board based on player counts is great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Gonna take some more plays, especially with the other player counts, but as of right now, I really enjoy the idea of building the city. The elements of each of the buildings have a lot of meaning. The market feels important, but because it's a "line of shops," it goes in the streets/alleys. The well is important to muscle your way into. Each color of building feels balanced. Becoming the watcher of the tower feels awesome and having the points/merchants trade-off feels like a good balance.

We'll see how it stands next to all of my other abstracts. It's maybe the longest abstract in my collection, besides a 19x19 game of Go. But it could climb if it works well with 3 and 4 players.

Initial Review: 7.75

Edit: Leaving the collection. The hidden information for an abstract really didn't fit the bill for me. It's a press your luck style game as well, which isn't what I'm looking for in my abstracts.

RATING: 7
If I had only one word to describe Medina, that word would be 'Charming'. From its vibrantly colored box, to the child's building block-like components, its simple rule set, and the resulting picturesque little city at game's end, Medina is extremely difficult to dislike.

Because no one initially has possession of their components once they are placed on the board, novices can begin playing with no knowledge of strategy and learn as the game progresses. As time passes tension ramps up as real estate disappears and play becomes cagey.

The only negatives I can find with Medina are the player shields should have been a little larger to conceal one's components. Also, discovering the victor at game's end is a score pad affair. Still, regardless of who won, everyone will enjoy the unique and colorful city you have built together.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.2

The production is brutal. Splendid cover, huge wooden pieces, thick cardboard... One small quirk: the purple and brown palace pieces look similar under poor artificial lighting conditions.

The gameplay is abstract (not overtly) and very abstract, it's one of those games where you'll see many "evil" moves. But your actions are your own, it's much less random that many other games of this genre, where the actions of your opponents will define your outcome more than your decisions. This is one of the things I care most.

The main danger is the AP, there's a wide range of possibilities with each move and no direct consequences. It was not something excessive in our game; indeed, it lasted less than 1 hour.

My copy came with mouldy pieces ... Apparently that is pretty common.  Had to clean them with a bleach solution which took a lot of time.  The rules are poorly written in some places, resulting in confusion and making the game more complex than it needs to be.  Despite this, it is a good game.

This reprint took a classy and classic abstract gem, and made it even more classy through thoughtful color and shape changes. Bravo. I like the new differences from the original, especially the 2-player inclusion.

Easy to learn and teach. Wonderful to view.

I enjoy the uniqueness of the gameplay wherein the wooden components become permanent fixtures for that game. I understand why this is favored highly among abstract games.

Pretty good take on the area control genre.  Played it for the first time when my friend from my gaming group brought it over.  As we played I was sure I had preformed horribly, but had fun doing it.  It turned out that I won!  Fun game where it seems like you agonize over every decision.  To I build up and take a chance and risk that someone else takes it, or claim in and risk losing points on a structure that might get a lot bigger.  The added suspense of when to take the corners for the tower bonus and the purple structures for the turn skipping bonuses that may be VERY important in the late game.  Pretty darn good game.

An iconic example of a game that I can explain in two seconds but enjoy forever. I recently had a game where a guy tried to break the game, cutting off every building as it began, running the market off into the corner... but the game emerged remarkably resilient. We could start a new purple building if the old one was cut off. The market ended up in a double dead end, so I got to start a new one somewhere else. While he was trying to force disruptions everywhere, the game, unperturbed, continued on. 

You cannot rattle this game. It will accept everything you give it and offer in return boundless consideration and depth concealed by elegance.

Great game now available in its second Version. Changes are subtle, so owners of the first edition do not need to buy the second edition, but if you do not own Medina yet, I recommend the second edition since you can easily play with the rules of the first edition (the second edition contains more pieces). Drawback is the Bad colour choice with Brown and purple palaces though (sometimes hard to distinguish).

But no matter what Version: highly recommended.

This is a fun push-your-luck abstract, where the idea is, all players get an even number of bricks in the 4 colors of the game. Each player puts two bricks on the board on their turn, and once a palace of a single color starts getting built, all future placements of that color brick need to add onto that same palace, until someone places one of their four claim markers onto the palace claiming it for themselves. The palaces score for size, and a few cute other criteria, so in general you want to add stuff just enough so it's tempting but not too tempting for someone else to take it.

When I think of classic Euros (rather than the modern 'heavy' brand), I think of simple rules, colourful themes and high interaction. Medina, which I've been wanting to try for years, is a classic example, and it confirms Dorra as one of my favourite designers.

Essentially, this is a multi-dimensional game of chicken. The longer you wait to claim a building, the bigger and better it gets, but how long before someone else jumps in ahead of you? All the mechanisms interact delightfully, with lots of potential dick-moves and some lovely emergent collusion in the placement of the road.

And it looks stunning too! My only criticism is that most of the mechanisms added to the second edition seem superfluous, or even to detract from the core tension of the game. I may try to pick up a first edition.

I don't know why, but I hyped up Medina a lot before funally acquiring it. Abstract area control isn't reslly a fsvorite genre of mine. Luckily, Medina is relaxing, elegant, and creates a beautiful presence on the table. I really enjoyed the natural flow in the group construction of the city. Some of the goal tokens swap hands more often than I like, and occasionally the city streets wind in a less than perfect pattern, but I always feel like I've accomplished something by the end. 

The only -real- complaint I have about the game is the production quality. I don't know if it is cheap wood or something in the paint, but the whole thing seems prone to mold. I spent a long time clesning my copy, and I'm still embarassed to share it ieth people due to the permanent mildew smell.

A gorgeous abstract where players work together to rebuild a decaying medina to its former glory. The gamplay is sleek, and the components are beautiful. At two-players, it embodies the knife-fight-in-a-phone-booth analogy: you are duking it out in an abstracted game of chicken, where it is just as easy to lose your hard-earned buildings as it is to swipe your opponents' of theirs. The strict turn structure provides such avenues: one mis-step, and you'll find that you've suddenly, generously, developed an expansive series of buildings for your opponent. It is a brutal process to get to what is a visually stunning end result!

Brilliant and beautiful game. I keep telling myself I'm not so keen on abstract games, then something like Medina comes along to prove me a liar.

Very simple to learn - probably quite difficult to master.

Played Medina with my wife and youngest daughter. It's a fun abstract strategy game with a unique mechanic placing various wooden pieces representing towers, walls, stables and merchants to score the largest palaces in Medina. It's on steep discount on Amazon currently, but be forewarned if you order your components and the box will arrive coated in mold. Took me a hour to Clorox the components and make them ready for use. Once you're past that it's a fun game.

It was well-hyped and respected by BGG, Tom Vasel liked it, and it looked so pretty.  And the components!  But the game REALLY fell flat for us.  It just has no direction.  The rules are theme are quite soulless.  This one is not for me, and was traded away.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is an abstract game with very simple rules.  Each player starts out with a collection of different pieces.  These include palace pieces in 4 different colors, stables, walls, merchants, and roofs.  On a players turn they place any two of these pieces following a few rules on legal placement.  The roofs are the only unique pieces among players and when they are placed grant that player ownership of the palace they are placed on.  At the end of the game players will score points based on size of these palaces and adjacency rules.

I typically don't care for games like this, it is completely abstract and those types of games don't resonate with me.  I did like this one though.  There are so many decisions to be made that it was quite the mental exercise.  One player, who did not enjoy the game, exclaimed afterward "this is boring as shit!"  While I don't agree, I can completely understand that reaction.  Usually these types of games do bore me and if you don't engage with the game you are going to find yourself quite bored waiting for your turn to come around and just slapping two chunks of wood down.

But there is so much here that if you give it your attention it is not boring in the slightest.  There are tons of strategies here and every time you finish your turn without placing a rooftop it is like playing a game of chicken.  But you also can't let the game carry on too long without placing them either or opponents can shoehorn you into suboptimal options.

It is also worth mentioning that the game is very pretty.  All the pieces are large, chunky, pieces of wood and at the end of the game it is quite impressive seeing the spread of colors and shapes you worked to put together.  And the rules really do consist of "place two pieces on your turn" so the game is super accessible.  One of, if not my favorite themeless abstract game.

The mechanics are simple, gameplay is relatively deep, with a very open board and multiple chances to hose other players with excellent placement and future planning.

I'm not crazy about it mainly because of how it is visually put together.  I think that with an abstract scoring game, availability of info is key.  The 3D board makes it kind of tough to see the best place for a move, and the tiny little merchants could be tough for some people to put down.  The color palette is also brutal; the brown and dark purple are very similar in low lighting, and their corresponding tiles are tough also.

Overall I'd stick with Alhambra, but I would play Medina again if there was nothing else going on.

Medina is an interesting building game. Every player has five building pieces in four colors: Gray, Purple, Brown and Orange. They also have a bunch of wall segments, a few merchants and three stables. Finally they have four roofs of their color.

On a player's turn they put two of those pieces onto the board. There can only ever be one unclaimed building of each color. So if there's already an open orange building, then any orange pieces much continue that building (as long as that's possible). Which means that you will be placing pieces to buildings that other people may take from you. Buildings can never be adjacent to each other. Once you claim a building as your own, by putting your roof on it, you may never again claim a building of that color. So the game is all about deciding when to take a building of a particular color and how to limit other people's buildings.

Points are score at the end of the game for every piece in your buildings, every wall segment and merchant adjacent to your building, and also a 4 point bonus if your building occupies a spot close to the well (which is randomly placed at the beginning of the game. There are also bonuses for having the largest buildings of a color (and different colors have different bonuses) and being the last person to connect his building to a tower via walls (different towers have different bonuses).

This is a game where there's a lot of thought that needs to be put into figuring out what buildings are going to be worth points. Factoring in whether you can be the biggest building of that color, whether you can be the last to connect to a tower and whether you can be near merchants, walls and the well is very important. Determining the order of how things happen is pretty big too. Using your stables effectively is important. They're the only way a claimed building can grow and they can get you the biggest building prize, connect you to a wall, get closer to wells and merchants, or just limit an opponent's growth. Manipulating when you claim a building is important, as you can start a new building of that color anywhere on the board afterwards.

In short, there's quite a bit to think about in this game and it's not all obvious at the outset. This is a game that will probably take a few plays before the strategy, and especially the tactical tricks you can play, start to click for me.

This is an older, fairly abstract game and I found that refreshing. Newer board games have gone down a different path for the most part, chasing victory points and engine building. This game presented an interesting challenge in a way I don't often see.

Wonderful old style German game. Plenty of positive player interaction where you build a great looking city together. Pieces are great too.

As everybody struggles to find something constructive to do that will not immediately be abused by the opponents, this ends up being an uninterrupted series of dick moves. Great fun.

A utterly gorgeus game that reminds me of an more in depth gamers variant of Carcassonne. Will not hit the table at every gaming event ofr me but when it does it's sure to turn som ehads.

Components are good. Not overly complex with just enough strategy. A completed game produces a unique and great looking a city every time.

Decent game, but nothing spectacular.  My only complaint really is that the walls/buildings that hide all your pieces could stand to be a little bit bigger, but they work well enough to hide the important stuff.  Relatively easy to score at the end of the game by just counting one city at a time.  Very easy to learn/teach.

Enjoyable light game for 3 or 4. Have not played with 2, but suspect that many other games would be much better at this number. Best with 4.

Scores will be tight, as it is hard to make a big play to set yourself apart.

Medina is a though provoking abstract/city building game.  There are certainly tense decisions and tough strategic choices to make.  You are only allowed to place two pieces each turn, which can lead to some minor AP due to wanting to make the optimal choice.  I have only played this with two and suspect that with more players, it might be even better.  We do like the two player experience and for an abstract game, this is one of the best.  Usually, I don't think about playing an abstract, but this one is one that I enjoy and would happily play most of the time if it was requested.  It plays fast and stimulates the brain in a just right, not too brain-burny, way.

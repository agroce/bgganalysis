Quite envolving Dungeon crawler with lots of variety. Good enough stand alone game but if added on to other sets can be an epic journey. Good artwork.

RATING: 7
I'm fond of a dungeon crawl sort of game every now and then.  This one scores with nice artwork and some clever mechanics.  I particularly like the way that peril builds up as you wander around dangerous places.  Your peril points then pay for the attacks of other players' monsters on you.  A small complaint is that I'd hoped for a bit more desert flavour.  A more substantial complaint is that the rules are unclear in parts and poorly laid out.

RATING: 5
Adds more dragons to the game, plus some one dimensional new monsters. The characters are excellent, but my only real beef with this set is a number of duplicate cards usable only in the desert.

Dungeoneer.  Dragons.  New outside terrain.  What could go wrong?  

There's something just right about wandering from a desert into the dankness of a discovered tomb.

Not a fan of all the duplicate cards, ah well, aside from that, it's as good as any of the other sets.

edit: I really feel ripped off cuz of all the duplicate cards. This should have been a half-sized set like Den of the Were-rats and Haunted Woods of Malthorin.
Rated lower than all the other sets because of all the duplicate cards.

OK. This series is really cool. A dungeon crawl in an hour. This is not the tactical style play of descent, but more the 'encounter' type play of runebound. The coolest mechanis is the peril/glory where both players get to be dungeonlord and hero on thier turns.

It has the same pros and cons as the regular set. It has cool art, nice minis but the difficulty of quests varies enormously and some of the character powers need a better description.

I like Dungeoneer quite a bit.  The Vault of Fiends added quite a bit by introducing scalable monsters.  However, I'm at the point where I wonder if adding more sets will enhance the experiene, especially since at this point combining all the sets would make the game too darn big.  The new cards look pretty much like the old cards with slight variations.  Perhaps if there were some kind of campaign system to tie the whole thing together?

See my comments about Tomb of the Lich Lord for my opinion on Dungeoneer as a whole. 

For Dragons of the Forsaken Desert:

This is definitely the least entertaining Dungeoneer expansion produced. I had high hopes for it (I mean, who doesn't love dragons!) but the added mechanics in the game make it quite a bit more fiddly. There are a lot of terrain-based modifiers in this set, and it really slows combat down. In addition, this is the first Dungeoneer set produced that has quite a few duplicate cards in it. I understand the cost/necessity argument, but part of Dungeoneer's charm was that every single card was unique--you never knew what was going to come at you. Now it's just a bit more bland. 

I'd love to see a second Dragons set that fixes some of the problems of Dragons of the Forsaken Desert and adds more (you guessed it) dragons! Dragons are cool, and they never get old. Now I've said the word "dragons" way too many times in this paragraph. Dragons.

This is my first dungeoneer set and it's preaty cool. I really like the mechanic of the game. Sadly there are 2 of almost every card, which does not happen with other decks, but it also has a way to divide the deck in 2 to play with 2 players, which is nice. 
When I get other decks I'll review my rating.

RATING: 7
A decent dungeon crawl game that FITS IN YOUR POCKET!  I keep it in my car in case I ever get stuck waiting somewhere with a friend and we get bored.  Look into it.  Sets released AFTER Dragons of the Forsaken Desert come with better cut out stand ups for the heroes, so that is something to look into.

It does everything you'd expect from an adventure game - exploration, combat, risk management, evil overlord tricks, flavorful game world - but none of it particularly well. But then, that's probably what you can expect from a set of 120 cards, and basic Runebound isn't much better.

Completely card-based dungeon romp that is always enjoyable to play. The amount of gameplay that is packed into such a small space is unbelievable (why can't more games take up so little storage space?!)

Luck-heavy but there are optional rules to help keep the balance (build map before playing, movement restrictions, etc.).

NOTE: Publisher's website has updated rules & FAQs which are definitely worth reading.

WARNING: Requires separate dice & counters (preferably red & green).

RATING: 5
Dungeon crawl card game. It works, and it's fun. Somewhat clunky, with unintuitive or unclear rules and several conditional modifiers that you need to keep track of. Still, it's a good experience, although bad luck with the dice will probably ruin that. I guess you have to try real hard to imagine turn after turn of futile dice rolling to hit a dragon as an Epic Fight.  

Interested in the other expansions.

Dropped two points. Played with 4 players and two sets, and it turned into the type of game I very much dislike. Lots of downtime, a game that doesn't seem to end and offers hardly any strategic choices. Play consisted of moving for many, many turns from one side of the map to the other, drawing the wrong cards and rolling dice without much effect. Two players would have been out of the game early if the other two didn't take pity. I wouldn't play this again with more than two players or more than one set. What I initally thought to be a strength of the game (multiple expansions, characters, &c.) turns out to be its weak spot.

Another good stand alone/expansion for Dungeoneer. Only one thing I didn't appreciated very much: too many cards are in two copies...

RATING: 7
Another solid dungeoneer game.  This introduced a lot of one-time use items, like scrolls.  While I liked that they tended to provide more healing, the one-shot approach was unappealing.  The saving grace of this expansion is the dragons...these are great monsters and are a good break from all those undead you find in the other decks.

One of the few games, that break the rule "more players, more fun".

Quests, monsters are interesting and graphics stand on the hihgh level.

wilderness

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Dungeoneer is a card-driven "dungeon" delving role playing game where players build the map, complete quests, and accumulate glory and peril as they traverse the map.  Glory is spent by the player to gain items and abilities for their own hero, while peril is spent by their opponents to cause them to overcome traps and face monsters.  Players always know how much peril and glory they have accumulated, thus they can know how much opposition they may face.  Each game is a standalone game but they can be combined.

Dragons of the Forsaken Desert is set in a wilderness, not a dungeon, but has map locations which can connect to a dungeon should players wish to combine games.  This game is tuned to go up against dragons, but adds in terrain modifiers and even sewers (which allow heroes to traverse the map quickly).

This is my first play of the post-Citizen Games Dungeoneer, and I generally think it's been revised well, and the multiplicity of supplements that Atlas has put out has been very beneficial to the game.

A well designed & interested dungeon-delving game. There's no stunning mechanics, but everything works well.

A dungeon-crawler (although not really a dungeon, but the "wilderness") in card game format - although you do build up a game board with location cards.
I like the glory/peril mechanic, and the interaction between players you have thanks to the curse & monster cards you use against other players (thereby making a DungeonMaster/Overlord player redundant).
The illustrations look beautiful - which they need to, as they are the only medium in this game (no miniatures but thick paper foldups instead).

A very nice combination of tile-laying adventure dungeon game, and a card game √É¬† la Magic the Gathering. As you in your turn spend your cards making dungeon life miserable for your opponent(s), this game doesn't need a game master.
Only drawback (personally) is the fact that the board on which you move your pawns isn't really a "board", it's just map cards, standard playing card size, that you play out. It would have been nicer with a real board, with thicker tiles and stuff. Really.

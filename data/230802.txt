Great, elegant game with simple rules but plenty of depth. A true pleasure of an abstract game with gorgeous, pleasing components. I also have the joker tiles and I am eager to give them a try. It was a must-have from the first runthrough I saw and after three plays, I'm happy to say my initial impression was correct. The length is perfect; the game ends at just the right time. Potential future 10.

LIKE: Great choosing mechanism and dropping tiles in the middle, but I would say this is the only mechanism driving the game. The game centered around these choices very well and kept the game cutthroat. Plays quick. Good looking tiles.

DISLIKE: The scoring felt fiddly, I wish there was a way to streamline it, but this was minor. Some of the turns felt repetitive, there's not a lot of progression (compared to say, Splendor). Possible AP turns, because if given enough time, one could see ahead who needs what and figure out what will be left in the middle.

OVERALL: This is a good game, one that has a bite to it. There are some turns that could really mess over someone, which I felt made the game entertaining, but I could see where some people may not enjoy it.

Azul is a beautiful game of tile laying and speculation. Or to be exact, early turns in a round are speculative as you are trying to guess what your opponents are up to. As tiles get taken from the offering and after narrowing down the number of possible end game sequences, the nature of the game changes into brutal number crunching exercise for the last few turns of a round. You are just min-maxing the point swings generated through the last moves. This has to be kept in mind when playing with AP prone people, since it can be quite frustrating when the flow of the game is regularly changing. A bit counter-intuitive scoring does not help the matter.

Nevertheless, I liked the game and would like to play again. I also reckon that after a few games under your belt the changes in the pace of the game will become less drastic because you will learn to analyse the situation faster.

I also have to mention that playing the game is also physically quite satisfying since the components are fun to fondle and play with.

The quintessential abstract game in my humble opinion. I prefer to use the "basic" version of the board, as it gives me more time to focus on my strategy.

Reminds me of one of those maths games you got to do in O Level and A level classrooms in the 1980s and 90s.  It's nice to look at and ok to play, but really unless you really enjoy doing things like Rubiks Cube and solving mathematical patterns, it might leave you feeling a little flat.  Good at what it is, so it gets a 6.  No more than that.

A good game, excellently produced, but it is ultimately a filler game. Not sure how it would stand to repeated plays. It seems very easy and obvious to minmax. Need to try it at different player counts. While it is a beautiful game, there is no way I would pay the MSRP, much less the rapine secondary market rates, for this game or its expansions. Very easy to DiY.

Who would have thought that tiling a kitchen could be such fun? The drafting mechanism, whereby what you choose from a set of four and what you don't choose both have implications is clever and nasty. While we're assembling tiles on individual player boards, it's important to pay attention to how much more of each colour our opponents are hoping to draft. Decisions get tougher and pitfalls deeper as the game progresses and the rows on your wall fill.

The tiles, their bag and the artwork are all very nicely done.  The rules are fine.

Azul at the moment, here in the Fall of 2017, is getting a fair amount of buzz on BGG.  I find Azul to be a good abstract, but I don't find it to be THAT interesting or fun.  I have played Azul now at a number of player counts, and I believe Azul is at its best as a two player game.  

Played as a two player, Azul does have a nice "zero sum" feeling such that you can really see, studying the limited number of markets in front of you, that the tiles you take, will NOT be available to your opponent.  In this way, you are able to really study the markets/game status quickly and easily and make satisfying, strategic and tactical decisions.  By contrast, when Azul is played at higher player counts, I think this feeling of easy tractability (due to more markets being used) and "zero sum" decision making (who am I trying to defeat by taking this?) is lost.

Another abstract that seems to work well for me. It's just interesting and just short enough where I don't get bored with the whole thing. There's a certain push-and-pull feeling to this as you're grabbing tiles you need and try to bait your opponent into taking certain others so that you can grab the rest of the tiles you want on your next turn. Player boards are slightly warpy but can at least be corrected over time.

The art style is simply wonderful and the heavy pieces give it heft.  They could have easily gone with cardboard chits, but the feeling of ceramic pieces feels so good.

It is a decent game with beautiful pieces. I enjoy teaching it to others, helping/watching them understand the game and then experience them change their tactics from game to game. I will enjoy it and continue to play it for that fact.

-people usually want to play a few rounds.

Really enjoyed this, beautiful tile drafting and placement with a lot of tough decisions while you're glancing around at what the other players are scoring on their own boards. Very simple, smooth, you can probably teach it to everyone including non-gamers, and then once you've grown tired of the base game you can flip over your boards for even more of an Azul exercise.

While I like the idea of introducing thematic historical references to people, the game play just doesn't suit for me, why are X people competing to place tiles on the walls of Evora? and why would you only 'complete' parts of the pattern? the game mechanics don't theme well for me, nor do the tiles match the mechanics for me. Distracts from my enjoyment.

Azul is a great, solid abstract, up there in the heaven with Ingenious and Quirkle, forming an ideal trimurti capable of appealing both gamers and families.

The chunky bits and the easy gameplay (that can quickly turn nasty in the hands of gamers) contribute to turn this into an instant classic.

An initial rating is 7, but I can see it easily going up.

UPDATE: Played with 4, the scoring seems to be much higher. It's harder to fork other players, so you don't get caught in bad situations as often. There are also more tiles to look at in a turn, so you can usually find what you need in the first couple of passes through the new tiles.

I don't think I'm interested in playing it with 4 again, as the forking is what interests me about the game. But 3 could be very good, giving the right combination of forking, more information than with 2, and no zero-sum outcomes.

11/17: An interesting abstract with shades of Coloretto or Piece o' Cake. My play was with 2 players, which felt a little brain-burny in the same way that Patchwork does. Figure out what you want, what your opponent wants, and how to fork them into doing what you want them to three turns in advance. But I suspect the game is both less brain-burny and potentially more interesting with 3 (or even 4). Players would be able to incentivize others to do things in both of their interest by setting up juicy splits.

Would love to try it with 3, maybe twice in a row, to see if it can become an 8.

Azul is fine as a simple, abstract game. If you are a fan of abstracts with a decent amount of player interaction in terms of what you select affecting everyone else, especially the next player, then you will probably like Azul. I've heard a good number of gamers singing the praises of this one and I don't dislike this type of game, but it's not what I'm looking for. I do like some abstracts, but this one play didn't set Azul apart in my mind. I can appreciate some of the cleverness in the design, but I don't really desire to play the game again. The only thing that gives me pause is all the positive comments from others I know. The components are very nice... that was a big plus.

RATING: 8.5
Azul is an interesting but quick abstract strategy game with good looking pieces. It clocks in at about 30 minutes with 4 if everyone has played and is a bit shorter with fewer. It feels a little bit like a less restrictive sagrada, even though there are no dice. You are drafting tiles and then trying to fill out rows in your "production" area so that you can place that color of tile in its spot in your wall. You then score extra points for placing next to tiles you have already placed, and end game points for completed rows, columns, and sets of the same color. 

I have two minor cons that prevent this from being higher. First, with the higher player counts it can be pretty chaotic and much harder to plan/easier to have your plans ruined. Second, there is a bit of luck involved where the colors you need just don't show up how you need them and you end up with one of your bigger rows in limbo until you can get the tiles for them. Also, you can get stuck taking a lot of bad tiles at the end of a round and take enough negative points that you probably won't come back.

Still, the game is so quick and tactful that I would call it a must try for most gamers.

Not sure where the theme came from, but the overall look and theme of the game are deceiving.  This is a nasty nasty game, where you will sometimes have to take some punches in what looks like a pleasant abstract game.  This should win the Spiel in 2018, and if it doesn't, its highway robbery.  Want to play more, and I don't see that changing anytime soon.  This could end up being a classic in a few years.  One of the best games to come out in 2017 for sure.

This is a nice and simple tile pattern laying efficiency puzzle somewhat reminiscent of titles like Patchwork or Indian Summer, but with single tiles instead of Tetris-like pieces. However, there's less time matching patterns and it takes more time counting scores. It's visually striking with it's classic Portuguese styled boards and the weighty plastic squares that are thick, hard and shiny to look like ceramic tiles. It's a looker.

I played it with two and four players and cause and effect is much better handled with two. With more players it's difficult to guess what's left for your next turn and it's harder to weigh whether to go for your own success or when to block. You cannot count on other players to block a great move for another player, so the dynamics change with player counts.

Given it's short playing time it is an excellent filler, but it's a bit mathier than the Tetris wannabees that are out there.

RATING: 7.5
Genuinely fun, very thinking while also being fairly easy to 'get'. Probably a good SDJ candidate. I haven't played the advance game yet, but I think I'd like it a little more. On the other hand, this game, while great, doesn't scratch that hardcore euro itch for me. It's a game I would buy for others who come over and aren't necessarily into super hard games like I am. I'd rate it right inbetween 'good - I'm usually willing to play' and 'very good - enjoy playing and would suggest it' it's not quite that second one, because in the end, if I'm with people who'd be willing to play a heavier game, I'd always take them up on the heavier game over this one. But if I'm with easier going game people, then this is right up there with the best in that category.

Beautiful little abstract game that plays out really fast.  We had an absolute blast picking this game up and starting with only a quick skim through on the rules, and a playthrough watched.  Very simple, gorgeous and closer scores than you would think.  I believe playing it a time or two more it could become more strategic and a bit of hate drafting could happen.  The initial two plays were trying to get what was best for ourselves, but this did cause a gripe from the next player in line, when you grabbed the tiles they wanted.

Me parece una delicia de juego. Es un abstracto de contruir un mosaico.. con una mec√°nica sencilla, pero que da para estrujarse los sesos.
En tu turno puedes coger todos los azulejos de un color de una ubicaci√≥n, y el resto pasa al centro, que a su vez, se convierte en otra ubicaci√≥n. El primero en coger azulejos del centro se llevar√° un negativo.
Cuando cojes azulejos los colocas en un pool de colocaci√≥n, que son filas de 1 a 5 posiciones. Todo lo que pongas va auna fila, y el exceso que no entre, pasa a una zona de puntos negativos.
La partida finaliza cuando alguien llena una fila.
Al final hay bonus por filas completadas (+2), columnas completadas (+7) o haber sido capaz de colocar todas las losetas de un color (+10).

Se explica muy r√°pido, se juega bastante r√°pido y es absorvente. Muy recomendable. A m√≠ me encant√≥, adem√°s, el aspecto es preioso. Azulejos peque√±os de bakelita.

It was okay. Even at 2 player, it was less cutthroat than I expected it to be. Decisions felt pretty limited by whatever tiles came out, and there was enough luck factor that it was frustrating.

Uwe's games like Patchwork, Cottage Garden, etc... do a similar thing, but in a more interesting way. Not a bad game, but with its price/production values, I'd definitely be wanting.

A perfect game for people new to strategy board games (adults or kids) that is still super fun for seasoned players. This will replace Splendor as my go-to intro game. Very impressed with the component quality.

Wonderfully short, too. About 20-30 minutes per play, and it usually ends up being played about three times in a row.

RATING: 7
Hmm, I'm torn. It's a very clever design, much deeper than it first appears considering the degree of randomness in the  round set-up. This is not my type of game, however, and I am really bad at seeing the long-term consequences of which tile I choose. So I tend to lose tons of points every round.

Part of me is fascinated by this, and makes me want to play more to understand the game better. But another part of me just wants to play games that don't kick my butt so severely. We'll see if my rating goes up or down with future plays.

Updated a notch after a couple of plays; there is randomness, but not excessively so for the length of the game and you can mostly compensate for the fickleness of fate by the way you approach your tile choices ... though of course sometimes there's no escaping the crash of excess tiles.

RATING: 7
I normally really dislike abstract strategy games, so when I saw this listed as one, I really wasn't to play, but the bits and presentation of this game still drew me in.

Fortunately, I found this really doesn't feel like an abstract strategy game, despite being pretty void of theme. I don't really know what it does feel like, but it's not really abstract in feel, in the way chess, Go, or the GIPF series is.

The game is about choosing tiles among various lots of tiles, trying to obtain tiles that help you, while leaving poor options for your fellow players. You're trying to guess what you must take this turn vs. what you think your opponents will leave for you until later.

Overall, this is just a really pleasant game. No doubt, the components add a lot to the experience as well!

Dammit, I wrote a really long comment for this and then it did not save correctly, so let's try again. 

Oh god, I got hammered at this which is fairly rare when I play abstracts with Heather. The game is obviously a lot a fun and I generally really liked it. However, I am not sure it has space in my collection for a few reasons. Firsly, I have a few abstracts already that never get played. Sure this is better but given how impossible it is to get hold of it is not worth trying to track down a copy. Also, not sure how well it players with more than 2 and not sure the theme is that appealing to me sadly (although the tiles are lovely).

My group generally doesn't like abstract games, but they do like elegant games. I picked up this game because I thought they might like it.

I really like how fast this game plays. It's quick between turns, but it also feels like there's a lot of strategy when you're trying to think more moves ahead than your opponent.

The rules are still simple, though, so it's quick to learn and play.

Good looking game with heavy tiles included to create Mosaic art. It is an abstract with a little bite to it, so some players may take offense. It plays in good time and has good decision making along with a spatial part. This is certainly not a 4 player game, best with 2 and fine with 3, 4 is just chaos. Should be fine with gamers and the family.

RATING: 8
Azul is a breath of fresh air for those that think euro games have lost their elegance. with a rule set that can be explained in 5 minutes, azul is an abstract drafting and tile laying game that creates plenty of tension and planning, with good play involving an evaluation of your opponents' boards. 

it plays in 45 minutes, it works with casual and serious gamers... what's not to like?

RATING: 9
I was not convinced of this game, but with how great Century is I decided to take a chance on this one too. Simple rules, but plenty of tough decisions throughout on what tiles to take and from where, plus what row to place them in since the tiles you take only go into 1 row on your board. So much crammed in to about 45 minutes, I wish I could have played it again right after. A few more plays of this I could see this jumping to a 9 as it is that good. Plan B has another hit on their hands.

Really beautiful game. The box calls to you. The pieces reward you for opening it. And the gameplay is quite refreshing and fun. It's a reward splitting game with a neat mechanism that plays along at a brisk clip.

What to choose has to be a balance between what is good for you and how the remaining choices will ripple along through the other players. Often you need to block, so keep your head up. Otherwise someone might run away with all kinds of bonus points.

The four player is fun, but feels a bit chaotic. Haven't played two-player yet, but I worry that it might be a bit brainburny as you try an ply your way through all the back and forth. Three is likely the sweet spot.

Only played two-player, but probably my favourite short abstract game in our collection. Surprising amount of decision making for optimal scoring but haven't found play held up by AP to any great extent. Components other than first player token are very high quality.

As gateway games go, this one's a good one. It's easy to learn but difficult to master, the way any great gateway game should be. The beautiful color patterns lend it great table appeal, another bonus for drawing players in. Where it falls short, of course, is theme. If you're with a group that prefers pretending their mighty heroes, this isn't the game for you. Also, it tends to be a somewhat quiet, solitary affair where everyone is absorbed in their personal player board and too wrapped up in their personal decisions to do much talking. These issues keep the game short of greatness for me. They aren't deal-breakers, however, and I do appreciate the game's elegant simplicity and deceptive depth.

Friendly abstract game for families. The idea is that you take small amounts of coloured tiles and arrange them via a 'collector' on your private board into the pattern depicted on the box front. By creating 'blocks' with multiple horizontal and vertical adjacent positions filled you score points. Most points wins.

The overarching pattern here is looking very carefully at what you leave for the player(s) after you, and this wears very thin after a while. There is also the somewhat worrying rule that a player who fills a line in the muster will herald the end of the game. How this combines with the fact that you don't want to leave juicy combos for those after you is not clear. As such its meteoric rise in the ranks surely must be explained by the game bits. Or perhaps simply because this is the level of complexity people can muster. I'll play again, but won't seek it out.

I've now played this game about ten times. It is fun, simple and pretty quick. The colours are nice and bright which makes the game enjoyable to play. It is also very thematic. I call this game simple but it has surprising strategic depth and a lot opportunities to hammer your fellow players.

My usual catering is games like Twilight Imperium, Runewars and Mage Knight but every collection needs games of different lenghts. This is one of the shortest ones I have (about 15mins per player). In my opinion it doesn't need to be ashamed of itself in this company.

I was really surprised by this one.  Went in with fairly low expectations, but found a simple yet deep (and surprisingly vicious!) abstract game.  What I like about it the most, I think, is that every game has its own feel - it goes in a very different direction each time.  Some are high scoring, some are low.  There is scarcity and flooding.  There is cutthroat hate drafting and perfect tile placing.  And there is always a plethora of options to choose from.

Will definitely be sticking around!

This game is incredibly easy to learn and super deep. You can make incredible comebacks, making the game a joy to play even if you are down on points.  I love the production quality. We have sunk about 10 hours into this game and still loving it.

The only complaint is the pieces sliding off the board. More than once my tile got shifted or the score counter moved. This actually botched our games.

I thought about punching out one board and glue it to another since we only play 2 player. This would slot the tiles and keep them put.

RATING: 7
Abstract game in which players have to take one of 5 types of tiles from a number of platters, each filled with 4 tiles randomly drawn from a bag. The tiles not taken end up in the middle. Players can also take all tiles of 1 type from the middle. The first to do so looses 1 point, however. At the same time, this player becomes the start player in the next round.
The tiles taken have to be placed in 1 of 5 rows which can contain 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 tiles respectively. If too many tiles are taken, so they can't fit in the row, points are lost. At the end of a round the rows which have been completely filled with 1 type of tiles are emptied. 1 tile is placed on a 5 X 5 board on the same row as the one just emptied and on the same type of tile. Each row of course contains the 5 types, and this is also true for each column. When a tile is placed on this 5 x 5 board points are scored: 1 point if not placed orthogonally adjacent to another tile, in the case it is placed next to another tile, the number of tiles in the row and/or the column in which it is placed are counted.
End scoring: 2 points for each row completely filled, 7 points for each column, and 10 points for 5 tiles of the same colour.

A lovely looking tile laying game, with an old school feel to it.  Players take turns drafting one set of coloured tiles from the available markets, or from the middle of the board.  Tiles from the market not taken are pushed to the middle.  Taken tiles are ‚Äúprepared‚Äù in rows, and when a row is finished, a tile is moved to the ‚Äúwall‚Äù to score points for adjacent tiles.  Bonus points for complete rows and columns on the 5x5 wall, as well as filling in all of one coloured tile on the wall.  Very simple to teach and play, but very subtle and devious - some serious thinking is required here.  Plays very quickly, and has high ‚Äúone more game‚Äù factor.  An instant classic, I suspect.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The best way I could describe this would be Yahtzee but wherein you draft your dice rolls. 

The point is to draft tiles in 5 colors, and over the course of the game you may only score one set a each color once. The score section rewards adjacencies in curious ways. 

Plays excellent with two players who can track one another. Curious about more players influencing the game, but likely the inability to guess outcomes ahead turns this into a more solitaire-like exercise.

Very pretty mosaic-building game which boasts a lovely production apart from two minor issues:  (1) the game requires a lot of manipulation of heavy resin tiles and the scoring cube is very easy to bump or knock around accidentally; and (2) the boards are warped enough that they spin too easily on the table, and again with all the tile manipulation happening the spinning is a real issue for the players.   The best thing about the game is the scoring system stolen (borrowed) from Qwirkle.   That makes slotting your tiles into the mosaic fun.   The game is not for the AP-prone however...   perfect information and lots to calculate on OTHER player's boards will be an annoyance for some.

A relaxing game...until you find the nasty sting in its tail.

[thing=230802][/thing] is an abstract game and one which seems to be becoming one of the hits of Essen.  I found the tile-laying to be a pleasant enough game, with good and interesting simple spatial decisions.  What I was not expecting, and fear may be the undoing of the game with a wider public, is the way a round can end with some real brutal play forcing opponents to take a bunch of negative points.  And with this some kingmaking may be inevitable, as you can be in a position where you decide who takes the negatives that will arise. 

So I started off thinking this is a must-buy game my family can play together, a sort of King Domino, which they love, but with more going on.  But by the end of the game I had changed my mind: the take-that elements presenting themselves at the end of many rounds mean it is too nasty a game for my family. Maybe even so much that it threatens its possible SDJ potential?

RATING: 7.05
Beautiful filler game which killed Splendor for me. There is something soothing in drafting and laying thick square tiles made of smooth hard plastic. While drafting there is constant necessity to look at the other players' boards and try to deny them easy choices and ultimately try to screw their plans up. Very nice and easy, yet simple and quick game.

[b]Favorite mechanism:[/b] Top rows are easier to fill while bottom rows require more of the same tiles which is especially tricky to achieve fast.

It's very pleasant.  The components are nice (except the 1st player token), the artwork is nice, it's not too long, and it's not too complicated.  One minor complaint is that turns are largely tactical until towards the end of a round.

Abstract strategy where players gather tiles onto individual player boards, filling in a pattern of tiles that score points for clusters of completed areas, with bonus points for completing rows, columns, or all of a coloured tile. Easy to play, tricky to outmanoeuvre your opponent.

20-30m, 2-4 players. < 5 plays.

Azul is an extremely popular abstract game that uses an interesting pool drafting mechanism and scoring that reminds me of Ingenious (I hear it's like Qwirkle, but I haven't played that). People seem to really enjoy this game because it's attractive, it has chunky bakelite game components, has gamer and non-game appeal, plays relatively quickly, and is easy to teach. I mostly agree with this. There is also no luck during the round, but the tile draws between rounds. This means it's not one of those perfect information abstracts. Also, players can be pretty mean in this game and it gets meaner, the less people you play with.

I personally don't like that 3/5 tiles have ornate markings and the other 2/5 are plain red/blue tiles. I also don't like the bumpable scoring tracks on each board. It's not Terraforming Mars bad, but it's annoying. I'd use a scoring app instead. One good thing about this game is that it's easy to mock up and give a try. Some people have used Ticket to Ride trains, [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1920696/playing-azul-h]while I've used components from another Kiesling game: Heaven and Ale.[/url] It's good, but I don't think it lives up to the hype it currently has at the time of writing this. Maybe further plays will change my mind.

Edit: and now the publisher has made the red set and blue set with ornate markings... you have to pay for each of these "collector's set" though. Very lame.

RATING: 6
Using a clean system of micro transactions where a player divides the loot (I take this, you take that) to attempt scoring patterns, you end up with a fast moving puzzle game with a nice tactile feel from little plastic Starburst tiles.

It is engaging to play and makes an easy to teach filler game. I'm just not sure how much I would get out of repeated plays, as your strategy won't change up too much and you are often just dealing with the optimal choice to make each turn.

Falls in the camp with games like Splendor or Century Spice Road.

[b]The theme[/b]: Pff! A theme in an abstract filler game? Why should it be there?

[b]The visuals[/b]: I must admit, I don't like it. I mean, yes, the components are soooo good, big, chunky pieces, high-quality boards...but I don't like this weirdly colorful look. Plus what I simply don't understand - why on earth are there 6 colors of tiles, 4 of them are painted with symbols and 2 are not? Really?

[b]The gameplay[/b]: In [thing=230802][/thing], you collect tiles of one color and place them in one row. In that row, you can't place any other color anymore, until you fill it with tiles of that first color. Then, you move one tile somewhere to your wall and score it, if it connect ortoghonally to other tiles. You can never have the same color twice in the same row OR column. Plus, if you should ever take tiles that you can't place anywhere (which happens almost every round), you lose significant points for them. So you need to carefully navigate through the game, what to take when and where to place it.

[b]The fun[/b]: Although there is no interaction, the game certainly is fun. You solve your own little puzzle but you need to also observe what your opponents could want so you don't help them.

Really pretty puzzley-type game however it is a bit of a shame the dark blue and the red tiles do not have patterns on them (I kept turning them over expecting a pattern on the other side :blush:) and honestly this could have been half the price tag and had cardboard pieces, but I did enjoy this one.

The selection mechanic for the tiles is really interesting and with each pick you must balance not only what you need but minimise the advantage for your opponents my not leaving anything too tempting for them to take straight after you. 

Scoring is interesting if a little cumbersome and the end game seems to come up pretty fast but overall I really quite enjoyed this one

Azul is undeniably a good abstract. It has great bits and a pleasant theme so far as that goes. I'd be happy to play it again. But I struggle to see this as a family game, given how utterly cutthroat it is when played well.
Perhaps it's ultimately not my kind of puzzle, perhaps I should try it two-player, perhaps I just need to give it a few more plays? I'm left with the strange feeling that it's a lovely and very clever design, but something about it just doesn't click with me.
Update: I did try it two-player, and with the free-placement side. It clicked with me a lot more, that way. It feels like it could grow on me...

Addictive, addictive, addictive.  A light game with heavy Resin tiles!  A delight to handle & play with--they are thick so they are easy to pick up, they are heavy & don't slide around the game board, and they sound great clunking together in the bag!
  A great plan-ahead & screw -your-opponent game--or just play it casually.

2-4pp tile laying

for combining sets:
One thing that you would probably want to consider doing with 5+ players is to create 2 "circles" of the disks (called factories I think?). Just make the circles as close to the same size as possible.

On a player's turn, if they take all matching tiles from one disk, then they slide the remaining tiles into the center of the corresponding circle. Then, when players are taking the leftovers of one type from a center pool of tiles, they have 2 center pools to choose from (this helps prevent something like a dozen tiles of one type getting pawned off on one player). As for the 1st player marker, I would propose that only one is used, and whoever drafts from either central pool first takes the 1st player marker for the upcoming round.

It seems like it would be a really long 8-player game, but it might be okay with 5 or 6 players with my suggested modifications.

RATING: 6
An unlikely family-level abstract from one of Germany's least well-known top designers. Azul is a tile-drafting design that is sometimes about creating good scoring opportunities for yourself and sometimes about not leaving them for the next player. A pleasant game that supports both very casual and more thoughtful (and spiteful) play. I'm sure we will hear about this at the 2018 SdJ awards.

HEAVEN & ALE, REWORLD, RIVERBOAT und eben AZUL - Kiesling mutiert anno Essen 2017 mengenm√§ssig zum Stefan Feld in seinen produktivsten Phasen. Und dies als Altmeister. Altmeisterschaft merkt man vor allem dem abstrakten AZUL an: retrospektiv in seiner Idee spielt AZUL routiniert seinen eigenen Autor und wird zum Knizia: Steine nehmen, anlegen, werten. Die Steine wurden zwar thematisch zu portugiesischen Kacheln mit wunderh√ºbschen Verzierungen gemacht und sind ein haptisches Vergn√ºgen, AZUL bleibt aber ein reines Wertungsspiel ohne wenn und aber, das sich in 20-30 Minuten runterspielt. Das Spiel hiess in einer fr√ºheren Entwicklungsphase EIN STEIN GEHT NOCH und hatte den Einstein als Denkgenie verkappt im Namen, was das Werk besser beschreibt. F√ºr Freunde abstrakter Designs ist AZUL eine sichere Bank √§hnlich eines Bausparvertrags. Die Gestaltung von Packung und Material ist vorbildliches Kunsthandwerk, nur der Holzw√ºrfel auf der Punkteskala erreicht das Rutschmilieu von TERRAFORMING MARS.

A great gateway game that has the same flavor to 2, 3 or 4 players. The material is very pleasant to handle (except the first player token that is really poor), the rules are quickly acquired but the game does not lack depth so far. A future classic that will easily find its place next to Splendor and co.

Kiesling is such an interesting designer, especially when he is away from Kramer and trying his own thing out.  And he manages to pull out a rather enjoyable abstract that is also beautiful to behold! The game gives you the feeling of tough decisions, though sometimes those decisions are obvious. Playing well is being able to analyze your opponents, which creates a bit of a brainburner and maybe more than I would necessarily like all the time as it's quite a bit to analyze what players have and what they need and the multiple ways they could get those things and how you could stop them and how not stopping them will let them do this or that, etc., etc., If you just avoid that whole aspect and play your own board without care for your opponents, you may do well or you may not and it basically comes down to who didn't screw up and who was luckier. What your opponents do can really affect your opportunities, even if your opponents never planned to help or hinder you. Don't get me wrong: I like Azul and enjoyed playing it the couple of times I did. But this is a game of opportunity and at times these opportunities can create themselves based solely on your opponents. Super seasoned players may be able to analyze their opponents and the supply and play a deeper game. But as a casual game, there's a bit too much luck to keep this in the camp of pure abstract and too much analysis to keep up the enjoyment.  And even though it's a quick game, it can feel a little dry by the end. Still, it's a solid game which I'm glad I've played.

Great gateway game with stellar production. This is exactly what I'm interested in when it comes to lighter/faster games, simple ruleset but has lots of tactical play and some depth.

The set collection elements in this one are simple to understand. But the scoring and the restrictions on how you can build up your board. And there is a bit of denial later on in the game which adds some good indirect player interaction

Probably my go to gateway game now, one that I will be looking to pick up

Azul follows a simple mechanic but provides some interesting strategy involving timing and placement. The tiles are quite colorful and well crafted, though I found the player boards to be a little lacking in thickness. The score counter can be a little fiddly and hard to tabulate with how the numbers are organized. Overall after my first play I thought it was a good game that I would play again but it didn't blow my doors off. The game play almost felt a little like multi-player solitaire to me.

I thought Azul was going to be Sagrada times 11 but it turns out it was just... fine. In Azul's defense, it does make for more player interaction than Sagrada, especially at higher player counts. But sometimes, there is very little to do and you can just get hosed because people chose one group of tiles and you got caught in the wrong seat.

Components: amazing, simply amazing (except the first player tile)
Complex: easy to learn and play
Weight: family
Players: 2 to 4
Length: less than 45 mins
Mechanics: build your pattern scoring as much as you can
Decisions: enough, could seem obvious, but not so much
Opinion: the game is beautiful, really beautiful. You have to build your wall with Portuguese tiles. The tiles are amazing.
There are some factories in the middle producing them, and, in your turn, you pick one color from one of the factories or from the center of the table and place them on your board. If you fill one row, you have built one tile in your wall. And you have to place them like a Sudoku (no same color horizontally or vertically).
It seems pretty easy, but you have enough things to take into account, should I take this one I need, or try to block my opponents, later on they could be too many tiles of that color so I have to place some on my ground floor (and they are minus points).
In a nutshell, amazing family game that can be played by anyone

I bought this game for family get togethers and for that it works perfectly. Simple rule set, pretty on the table with a decent amount of strategy. However, while my rating could rise over time, this one fell a bit flat for me. Perhaps it was a bit overhyped? I struggled grasping the optimal strategy, but only played it at four players and I believe this would work better at three, or especially two where it could potentially shine. Glad to have it in the collection for situational gaming and I bet it sees the table a lot, but a little bit of a miss for me.

An excellent abstract game with great presentation and components. The rules are straightforward and easy to teach (take all colors from the center and pick where to place them in your player board) and as the turns progress each decision grows more and more important and agonizing.

Azul is a fantastic tile drafting game where players aim to complete rows and columns of certain tiles, gaining points for adjacency planning. It is just forgiving enough to the point where decisions are difficult and need to be planned ahead, but if a plan doesn't go through, it is easy enough to shift and aim for another color or row in future rounds. Additionally, there is a table-wide "push your luck" element as the center location fills with appealing pieces, but the first to take it will suffer a negative point. Every decision here feels interesting. Very similar to Sagrada, Azul is in the same style, but better captures the spark of fun. A great game.

I lost this game by one point, it looked like I was losing epically but the scoring is so intricate that it was nearly a draw. Highly recommended casual game. If we could somehow get silk screened play boards to put in the dice bag then this would be an amazing travel game...

Azul is a very clever abstract tile-drafting/laying game, playing well at any count, but perhaps best at 3 (or 4).
The game involves a draft of tiles from common  pools; as each pool is selected, all similar tiles are taken, and leftover tiles moved to a common pool.
Selected tiles are sorted into rows with 1-5 slots; after a row is complete one tile may be placed in a matching position on the actual player board and scored for orthogonally connected tiles at round end.
But if a tile cannot be played it goes into a penalty queue, also evaluated at round end.
Selecting the common pool penalizes the 1st player to do so as one tile in the queue, but this player will select 1st next round.
The game awards completed columns, rows and sets of 5 similar placed tiles; first to finish a row triggers game end.
This all makes for an attractive, interactive abstract with flexible player counts.
Lives up to all the hype- recommended.

RATING: 9
Azul for me is the poster child for why sometimes theme doesn't matter.  When I first started this hobby I thought it was the most important thing in a game.  It's not.  

Both Azul and Photosynthesis came out around the same time.  Both have been lauded by serious gamers.  Lots of people say Photosynthesis is an abstract, but it's not.  It's mechanically very thematic.  I suspect the people who say it's not are into flavor text and characters.  What you do in Photosynthesis makes sense thematically.  It's rather easy to teach.  But it's very repetitive and I found it rather boring.  

Azul, on the other hand, has rules that aren't very thematic.  Yes, there's a theme and there are some things that fit.  But at its core it's abstract.  Ah, but the gameplay, that's another matter.  Requires more thought and planning that it first appears.  Screwage is there if you want to play that way.  It's not Chess - not even close - but it's a very good game.  I knew after one play that I liked Azul.  I knew after one play of Photosynthesis that I could never play it again and never care.  Theme didn't play a role in making the better game.

Very creative mechanic for placing tiles and scoring points.  Components are top notch.  Suffer from the fact that another players bone-headed decision can sometimes ruin your game kind of like 5 tribes, especially if you are counting on them to maybe the optional move on their turn and instead they decide to play to screw up someone else's game and their own.  Still it is over quickly and you can play again.

A pleasant tile tableau building game that starts out relaxing in the beginning. By the end though, the choices get much tougher as there are less places on your board available to build--but you must takes something even if you can't use it which means penalty points--and then you don't want to leave something that just greatly helps/sets up the next player.

The back of the board is blank--you can decide where to put the colors in each row, but still must be one color per row/column. If you're not careful you may block yourself from completing a row which would be a great sadness. Definitely nice.

Still i need to try it at 2 but with my experience from one play, i think it is a bit overrated.

RATING: 6
Smooth, instant-fun and component-wise stunning game.¬† Bakelite pieces are fantastic.

But the question is: is there enough control?¬† You need to maximize your score with regard to several objectives.¬† And many aspects of the game are beyond your control.¬† Hence, I can see some players, having luck, being able to fulfill somewhat conflicting goals and others, not so lucky, not being able to do so...
To be verified in future games.

The length of the game rises my doubts too.¬† If at least one player finds it profitable, he will finish the game after just 5 rounds.¬† Others - with more sophisticated plans - will suffer.¬† Of course you can always plan short-term, but is it the idea behind the game?
This is the issue to monitor too.

Plan B has again done a great job to create a visually appealing game for a great designer. Highly recommended game.

In Azul, players are drafting tiles from a central area to prepare them to add to a personal tableau. When one player finishes one row of the tableau, the game ends. Basic endgame bonuses (completed rows and columns as well as all tiles of a type covered) are applied and high score wins. Each round, the center of the table is populated with groups of four randomly selected tiles of five types. Players take all of one color from a group and the remainder in the group moves to the center to form another group that the leftover tiles from each group feeds. You can draft from the center group in the same manner you draft from the initial groups. You have to draft all of one color, which can you lead you to drafting tiles you cannot use. Tiles you cannot use are deducted from your score for the round. The tableau you are building is a 5x5 grid with each column and row consisting of 5 different tiles. From top to bottom, the prep area is 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 tiles large. At the end of a round, players move one tile from filled prep areas onto the tableau and discard the rest. Tiles added are immediately scored for columns and rows of adjacent tiles. 

The game can seem overly simple at first, but once you start to understand that adjacent tile types score more points and you prioritize the endgame bonuses, a lot of considerations start to come into play. You can also choose to "hate" draft in a way to block a close competitor or force them to draft tiles they can't use and eat some points. The game is well-produced. The Bakelite tiles are nicely designed and feel good in the hand. I see why this was one of the better received games this year: easy to learn, subtle, beautiful, and satisfying.

Azul is similar to Dragon Castle in many ways. It's an abstract game using gorgeous bakelite tiles. It has a great sense of player interaction and excellent decision points.

In Azul you are attempting to score points by filling in your carpet/fresco/player mat with tiles in a certain order. You get points when placing tiles next to already placed tiles, and for completing columns and rows. The trick is that you want certain colours in certain quantities and other players will do their best to help themselves while hurting you.

At the start of each round there are a number of small piles of tiles, each pile has 4 tiles at random. On your turn you must choose one pile and take all the tiles of one colour present there. The rest of the tiles are pushed in to the center of the table. You can take all the tiles of one colour from the center but the first person to do that each round gets -1VP. 

You do not get to place the tiles you take directly on your carpet, instead you assign them to the waiting area of a row (on the left). Each waiting area needs some number of tiles of the same colour in it before one of those tiles is promoted into the carpet on the right and the rest are discarded.

It's an elegant game with relatively deep gameplay. Your decisions are influenced by what your opponents are collecting, what moves you leave them, and what you think they will do. You often have a plan to acquire certain tiles but need to manufacture the opportunity to do so. Attempting to predict and manipulate your opponents' moves is where this game shines.

If it weren't for Dragon Castle I would definitely be adding this to my collection. I probably still will because I think Azul will work better as a 4 player game, and it is a bit shorter with less set up time so it works better as a quick filler.

2018-01-13 - 9 - What a great, clever game! It reminds me of Ra. It's totally different in terms of gameplay, but the decsisions that you make, must take into consideration what other players do, have, or want to do. The production value speaks for itself, but I'm really glad that with the great looks comes a very, very good game too!

Quite a cutthroat drafting and tile-laying game, you draft colours of tiles from the available sets and collect them on your player board in order to fill rows and potentially score those tiles. Simple to teach and simple turns but players soon realize how you have to pay attention to what other players might want.

RATING: 9
A simple drafting system of nice resin tiles, building up into some tough dilemmas about what you can afford to leave behind for next time, and whether you can present a more appealing alternative to someone who might deny you the tile you need. I've grumbled that a lot of set-collection dilemma games just aren't as good as Coloretto, but this may surpass it.

Rated for a 2-player game, which was really nice and intense.  Simple moves played with exceptional components made for real enjoyable experience.  This is a REALLY NICE intro game for a new player or for a casual quicker game.  It doesn't drag on too long.  It fills a nice niche.

3-4 players lack ability for much planning ahead.   In this regard, this becomes more of a casual game.   I see playing this more for 2. 

Nice production and a decent cost.

RATING: 4
Humdrum set-collecton game. Hard to strat when tiles left over are constantly changing until the turn gets back to you. So you can't really plan ahead. Win condition felt gamie same with the vp loss mechanic, easy to have a runaway leader in this random mess. Requires low replay value. Yeah I'm not sure what the hype is about. Maybe I'm just a board game snob. If you like a game like Five Tribes, you would probably like this.

I suspect many gamers will get stuck with This garbage when the hype is over. So try before you buy! This is not even half a game. Played with 3. Scoring is cumbersome, rules unnatural, why destroy n-1 tiles to place 1, the score board is always the same. No arc no combos. Sagrada wins from Azul on every aspect.

Has an old school vibe and quality components.
Its a multiplayer abstract that works because rules are straightforward.
As a game it doesnt offer any fun and the choices... well there are not too many..
The gameplay is as streamlined as it can be. so it makes for a good game with casual gamers.. However because of the old school vibe i dont comsider this a gateway game.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with this but it lacks fun for me or it doesnt play with my brain so much...  Maybe nice to play this two player against someone who cant stand losing this open information abstract with a small luck element.

Played with correct rules, this was still quite a good game but  it slowed down the game play or at least felt that way from my unintentional variant to game play. Still have opportunity to hose people, particularly late in the game. 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Played two games, one with the wild tiles and one without and enjoyed both. Appears to be various strategies to pursue while keeping an eye on your opponents to gauge the timing of the end game as well as making life more challenging for them by taking/dumping their desired factory spot. Tiles are pretty but are lighter than I expected. Easily plays in under an hour once everyone knows what they're doing. 

Wild tiles take 10 tiles out of the game (2 of each color) and give you potentially more options in the construction phase.

Okay, played the first 8 games incorrectly with my own variant...;-) We were playing if you took the middle tiles you took everything and floored the ones you didn't use. Instead you only take one color of tiles from the middle and leave the rest so it isn't quite the poison pill as before. Or, perhaps, it is a different type of poison pill.

Beautiful tiles. Enjoyable abstract. I like that the game is as much about outthinking your opponents as playing your own board. Definitely keep an eye on what tiles other players need, and factor that into your tile selection. Great tactical strategy about when to select tiles from the middle to garner the first player token, change the order of who may get stuck with leftover tiles at the end of the round, and leaving opponents with tiles that they may not be able to use. Sometimes foisting negative points on other players is just as helpful in terms of end game score outcomes. Also, this game plays well at all player counts. Two-player is great since it's a different strategy than higher player counts due to likely only going through the tile bag once if you stick to 5 rounds.

Zu Rundenbeginn werden ein paar H√§ufchen aus je 4 Steinen erstellt. In deinem Zug nimmst dir ein H√§ufchen, beh√§lst alle Steine einer Farbe und legst sie in eine Reihe deines Tabloes. Die Runde Endet, wenn alle Steine aufgebraucht sind, dann werden vollst√§ndige Reihen aufgel√∂st und ein "Patchwork-Steinchen-Teppich" erstellt, der dann je nach angrenzenden Steinchen Punkte abwirft.
F√ºr mich ein total √∂des Spiel. Wie sowas Bestnoten in der Spielbox hervorrufen kann bleibt mir ein R√§tzel. Ich spiele dann doch lieber Monopoly oder Mensch √§rger dich nicht.

(after three 2p games) 

great theme (love azulejos), great drafting mechanism, fun little game. Abstract but with azulejos so it doesn't matter. In a 2 player game "hate drafting" could be perform pretty easily. But it's also up to you because in this game you have perfect information (nearly no unknown information). So you can prevent it. Generell luck  it's not that relevant in this game. You can follow  your strategy but you have to adapt to the situation and to the other player. The decision at the beginning are not easy but during the game it will be easier. That means you can play more thoughtful.  

I will definitely buy it at Essen Spiel.

Wow this game lives up to the Essen hype. Really simple (if slightly intuitive, e.g. odd taking 1st player token gives you negative points and maybe nongamers might be confused about the scorig) yet has quite a bit to think about between balancing how many and what tiles you are placing, and the placement in your grid to maximize points. It also has pretry high interaction for a euro, plays quick, and the graphics and components really highlight how clean the gameplay is. The only negatives are since it is rather deterministic it might lead to AP for some people, and while very solid it is not spectacular. I think almost everyone will like it, but don't fret if you can't play it.

J'adore les jeux de Kiesling. Celui-ci me fait un peu penser au g√©nial Sanssouci : on y retrouve une m√©canique simplicit√© et astucieuse, ainsi qu'une tension croissante dans les parties. Et en plus, le jeu est super beau avec ces petites pierres en bak√©lite !

Il n'y a qu'une seule chose √† regretter : la r√®gle fran√ßaise est nulle (il y'a des fautes d'orthographe dans tous les sens, des mots anglais qui ont oubli√© d'√™tre traduits, des points importants qui ne sont pas assez mis en valeur, des termes qui varient d'une page sur l'autre). Malheureusement, le jeu sera difficilement compr√©hensible en l'√©tat par un public familial qui doit essayer d'analyser les r√®gles.... C'est nul de la part d'un √©diteur qui a pourtant de la bouteille dans le domaine de l'√©dition.

RATING: 7
A very solid abstract game where you gather all tiles of a particular color on your turn.  You must take tiles of a particular color if you can.  You place in a 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 tile location.  If you have any leftover, they go to a negative tile location.  Also, you can go first on the next turn if you are the first to take tiles from the center but you take a -1.  At the end of the turn you move the tiles to corresponding locations.  You get 2 points for completing a row and 7 points for completing a column and you score 1 point for every contiguous tile.  You will play 5-7 rounds.  When someone creates a row of 5 the game is done so it is often over in 5 turns.  

I really like the game.  It is one of the better abstract games.  It is simple, but at the same time, there is a surprisingly high level of interaction as you can really hose your opponents if they don't have room for large numbers of tiles.  I would like to own this game.

5 plays. So far, better with more than 2 players. At the low player count, easier to go back and forth stopping the opponent from getting tiles, so it gets a bit more cutthroat. With more than 2, the game focuses less on a one to one basis, and the interaction is more balanced; you still have to be looking at when to block the opponent, when to go first for the general pool tiles, etc. This game is great, simple, fun, interactive, easy to teach and the components are beautiful. You can play with gamers and non-gamers and I think anyone could enjoy this game.

Beautifully constructed both in terms of mechanics and the physical build quality of the game, this game's sudden explosion of popularity is definitely not a flash in the pan. It's also great for playing with people who don't really play boardgames usually.

Warning though: the rulebook makes it sounds way harder than it is to play, and it's actually harder than you'd think to explain how to play verbally even once you're confident yourself. With new players it's easier to sort of dive in with the basics and then explain the more nuanced bits of the rules - scoring, placement rules, the floor, basic strategy re end score bonuses, etc - as you go.

Tons of hype for this game and I showed it to my wife and she took a look at a couple of pictures on BGG and then had me order it. It came 2 weeks ago and is probably one of her fav games to date. We love the drafting mechanism and scoring is simple. Plus the tiles have that same allure Splendor‚Äôs poker chips have. Great all around game. My favorite abstract game to date.

tried it in essen 2017, I expected it to be a bit too mean in 2p so i passed on it. Decided to pick it up anyway because my girlfriend really liked it, in 2p players it suuuper well. the hate drafting doesn't feel pointless and mean, it feels like it has to be there to play properly.
Production quality extremely high and really good game.

Believe the hype on this one...

It is a fun abstract game that offers both high accessibility to non-gamers and nice density of decision making.  

After both games I have played so far, I was left wanting to immediately play again so that I could implement some different strategies.  For me, this is a hallmark of a game with staying power.

My family, including my mom, had a blast playing this over our Christmas break.

Just an amazingly easy to learn but difficult to master game that plays so differently at the various player counts. "Murderously evil" at 2-player becomes "joyfully deliberate" at 4=player. Gorgeous to look at and to feel. Colorful. Exciting. Just hard to believe it is an abstract game!

Azul is a winner in all categories. It looks great with excellent component, especially the tiles. The game is a cool puzzely abstract with an interesting market like system to acquire the tiles. I like the challenge in optimising my points. The 2 player sure is more interactive, but I like it a little better than the three or four player game for that reason. The variant doesn't do it for me, but the base game is a winner for me. Highly recommended!

We played 3 times with two people on the coloured side and the first 2 games ended in 14 minutes.  The game looks nice and the tiles feel great but it just seemed to be missing some depth.   I guess it works great as a gateway game and maybe if we had more people it would be a better challenge.   

We added a house rule that you required a set of 5 same coloured tiles as well as a horizontal row and that stretched the game to 26 minutes. 

I would much rather play Sagrada as it has more of a challenge for us. 

Will play a few more rounds on the gray side and see if that changes anything

This is my early pick for the SdJ winner... it's been a hit with everyone I played and saw played the game, it's simple and engaging and with surprising amounts of player interaction.

Simple rules and tense gameplay. My main quibble is that it is never going to feel like it presents a very different puzzle from game to game--I finished playing it and felt "well, we could play it again, but it would just be the same thing". -- That said, whenever I have taught it to people they played it once, then immediately played it again. Good sign.

I highly recommend keeping score with a pad of paper or chips/tokens, not with the little black cubes which are very easy to jostle. The player mats on my copy are also not flat and are very easy to move around, shifting tiles.

Beautiful and mechanically solid little pattern building game, which is actually quite thematic for an abstract. Probably great as a gateway game, too. I'm not sure how sound it is "strategically", as there is some luck involved with the drawing for the factories. Not so sure about replayability, but I'd say I'm up for a few more games.

I am absolutely smitten with this game. I don't tend to like abstracts, so when I rate one this high, there's got to be something special there. I love the way tiles are selected, and the scoring is both unique and satisfying with how it escalates over the course of the game. You don't get too penalized for messing up, so there's some room for forgiveness. Along with that, there's a good amount of player screwage, but not to the point where it feels spiteful. Just an incredible game that came completely out of nowhere. Others have said it, and I'll echo it as well: If this doesn't win the SdJ next year, it will be a crying shame. Possibly my favorite game of 2017.

Azul is the abstract game I needed.  It seems to be the most accessible abstract I own that people who do not normally own abstracts feel like they can win.  Game looks great on the table, is very easy to teach, and gets "Let's play that again" responses from people I game with.  All around winner.

It's everything I enjoy in game design: it's easy to teach, with lots of depth and hard choices, beautiful components and a rich tactile feel that never gets old. The scoring can be a bit too confusing for it's own sake. Still, it's approachable by nearly anyone and plays every player count well. I think this game will grow to be a staple and a classic.

I can see this being a decent family game if played at a fast pace (i.e. making the decisions mainly on intuition) but the gameplay feels odorless and unexciting, and the game is excruciating when played with overanalyzers. Also, unlike the cover suggests, half of the tiles do not even have a pattern printed on them, which is quite disappointing. A separate score track for every player is also a weird production choice.

RATING: 7
A solid abstract with nice components. Plays quite quickly, as realistic options are limited and best choices of tiles are sometimes obvious. It's all about squeezing the most points out of your tile-laying, and going for multiple, overlapping bonuses at the same time is the way to do it. Similar to Sagrada, with a bit of a Mammut feel (with the growing central pot).

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8/10):[/COLOR]

[i]I can see Azul being played a lot in the coming years; the rules are a breeze to teach and the gameplay is smooth yet packed with both meaningful and difficult decisions.  Azul is beautiful game and the tiles are absolutely amazing, just handling the pieces is a satisfying sensory experience. Azul is one of those games where the designer is able to create a very simple set of rules that create a deep game play experience; I am always amazed when a designer is able to create such an elegant game. I'll admit that I didn't think Azul could live up to the hype and praise it had received by my expectations were exceeded. Azul has become my favorite game that was released in 2017.[/i]

A pleasant tile collection game, but I don't understand why it's so highly rated. The collection mechanic and the way it works into tile placement process on your mat feels fresh and very neat, no doubt. But it's still just a set collection game - observe what other people need, and either get there before them or take other tile sets, judging how long you can take before you need to pick the ones you really want. And work towards completing your sets. It's not a game the family is going to love given how abstract and quiet it is, and how observant you need to be to do well. It's too long for a filler/opener, and not enough theme or oomph to be a game-night centerpiece. I mean, it's an abstract tile collection game. Neat and enjoyable, and I'd happily play it anytime someone requests because it does it well, but it's not something I'd seek out either.

If any hyped game from the last few years deserves to grow some legs and hang around for a while, this is it.  It is so simple, but so good.  It is competitive with a a set collection mechanism highly reminiscent of "I split you choose", but with the ability to be meaner.  This is a game I could play over and over without ever needing an expansion (in fact, I hope there never is one).  I could even see this one fitting nicely into a tournament play format.

Azul is a quick abstract tile-drafting game. There are a number of different offers containing a mix of tiles, and a player can claim all of a single tile color from one of the offers, putting the rest in the middle. Later, tiles can be claimed from the middle in the same fashion. Claimed tiles go in staging rows of varying size, such that too few of a color won't get placed this turn, and too many will result in penalties. Once actually placed on your tile board, tiles will score for adjacent tiles, with bonuses for completing rows, columns, and all of the same color. The game is actually quite a bit more interesting than it sounds from a description, and there's a fair amount of tension in getting the tiles you need. It's a good filler.

This game looks amazing: the art on the player mats and the box/bag and of course the tiles! On top of that the gameplay is equally well done. The different mechanisms (drafting the tiles and managing your production lines) fit together smoothly and are easy to teach. The game is a lot of fun: it plays fast, it's very satisfying to accomplish your plans, and there are ample opportunities to block other players.
In contrast to other raters, I think the game is equally good as a two player or three/four player game. While a four player game is more laid back, a two player game is quite vicious. Also, in the four player game there's enough possibility to predict your opponents and plan ahead.

(01/18)

Right now it is benefitting from being a new adquisition, but it's getting a lot of plays because it is so easy to teach and strategize, basically on the second round you already can catch up to people that've been playing a lot and get what to do, I've actually lost to people who play for the first time, because some decisions you make sometimes do not get to flourish and it affects your score. I find this has a great balance between chance and strategy, you can make a plan, but the tiles that are drawn for that round might make you re-think it and adapt. 

It is pretty to look at and it gets attention from people outside the table when you are playing it. The tiles are really well made and it feels like it will last for a long time. The tactile element of it makes it gratifying and engaging.

There's people who hate the score track, I feel it could be better but it is not bad either, I've only had one problem with someone knocking the cube out of place and not knowing where it was.

Touted as a "mean Sagrada", the meanness isn't readily apparent until it hits home, while the Sagrada comparison is easily seen. Instead of dice drafting, there's a tile draft which, if you time it wrong, can dump doodoo all over your plans in one big stinking hit. Other than that, it's OK, utilising the Qwirkle cross-scoring pattern which an experienced player can exploit easily enough. Fine, but nothing to gush over.

Yes, it's yet another 'get stuff from the middle to arrange on your individual board' game. But it's pretty, the individual board puzzle is interesting and crucially, the 'get stuff' mechanic allows serious interaction (helped by the other players' boards being easily readable at a glance). Some great exclamations of horror as players realise what they're going to get stuck with. So far I've played with 3 and 4; 3p allowed the screwage to become more calculated and I can see it being really nasty with 2.

RATING: 7.5
A short, abstract tile drafting game that is simple but also very cutthroat. The tiles are very nice, polished, and chunky. You are taking tiles of a single color from factories or the middle in order to make sets to add to your board. The ability to hate-draft your opponents is pervasive, which will cause your opponents to lose many points. The scoring mechanic is unique as you score points for adjacent tiles as well. The game ends when any one player has at least one row all filled up, which typically is 5 turns. This makes the game feel extremely short. I wish there was a different game-end mechanic.

Great production backed up by solid gameplay. I love the tactility of this one. I feel this game has a bit too much point scoring such that everyone is always going to score dozens of points, and the winner will be separated by a relatively small margin. I wish there was a better way to distill down what scores rather than having to constantly be moving the score throughout the game. 

But that's a relatively minor complaint in an otherwise simple, smart game. Plays relatively quickly, but filled with interesting decisions.

RATING: 3
1 play, 4p. You can play it from turn to turn like some kind of solit√§r, but your left neighbor will most likely win. If you want to play it "right", you have to consider the result of your current turn for the options for all players. However, to foresee what impact your turn will have, you have to consider all options and the likelihood that the other players will choose what seems to be the "best" option for them. Only then you can play the game "good". Otherwise it is all just chaos and chance. This applies also if the other players do not choose the option that you decide would be their best one.
The crucial thing is that there seems to be one "best" option for you, and you want to find it considering several dozens or even hundreds variants what the other players may do. This causes downtime and the uncomfortable feeling, that you should have even been thinking more about it, because you have the feeling that there should be a better turn. Kingmaker problem anyway. Poor with 4p, maybe could run with 2 - I will never know.

I went back and forth on this beautiful little abstract strategy game. I am so happy that I made the decision to pick it up after finding it on discount because of VERY minor box damage. I love the drafting of tiles and how the reject tiles build up in the middle until its finally worth the negative point for someone to go there. The game plays fairly differently with 2 than with 3 or 4 in my opinion. You can much more easily manage your needs, denying your opponent their needs, and predicting what is likely to get taken (and therefore left for you in future rounds). I also like going for the goals to get the end game bonus points. In larger player count games, you are having to refill the bag with tiles more often than I'd like. It is a very minor knit pick. It can be taught easily, played quickly, and has fun game play making it a good filler game.

(+) Very interesting scoring mechanism in place. It is less so about the draft as it is about setting up your board for a significant scoring bonus.  
(+) Lean ruleset and objectively merciless player blocking and interaction. Meaningful decisions abound.

(-) It's not particularly fun. A multiplayer abstract tends to garner a lot of quiet think-time. 
(-) Turn structure is repetitive. Variety is only found in the tile draw, and on that note, a particularly unlucky player can experience in the following:

RATING: 5
Interesting twists from wanting all early to sometimes being cautious mid-game. 

Very nice production.

Serious AP risk in endgame. The game state is very large, all information is open. Several players will be fully blocked in some colours, reducing the game state at a very high cognitive load. The same colours, what rows, what players, how is the distribution on the board. 

The player who thinks the longest in their 3-4 last turns is highly likely to win, as the bonus points at the end are worth so much more than the points you accumulate during the game. This breaks the otherwise nice rythm. Playing fast early is fine, but playing fast in the endgame means the winner to a large part will be random.

Not played on 2, that might work better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I've only played with 2 and can see it being better and less predictable with more players, but I don't really care to try.  A very boring, solvable abstract of the type "If I take A, you'll take B, then I'll take C, then you'll take D,  and so on, so I'll get 12 points, and you'll get 11... Ok, so no need to play, right?"  It's not completely predictable, but it just full of obvious choices that force your move, and it seems like it would be very easy to build an AI that would beat you every game.  It's also a blatant example of taking a game that could have been designed 50 years ago and providing nice components so you think you're playing something new and special.  Patchwork actually feels quite similar and a lot better.

:thumbsup: Scales very well with different player counts.
:thumbsup: It has built-in revitalization of gameplay: once it starts getting stale, you flip your board to the side without pre-printed patterns.

Multi-player abstracts are hard to pull of well; Azul comes close but it still struggles with the difficulty of an unbalanced play group.  
At two players, this is very good indeed; it's the fact that it works at a higher player count at all that gives it the edge over some other 2p abstracts.
(2018) Up a point after playing with the "grey-board" option, which changes how you have to assess the pieces - it stops feeling quite so solvable.

Take tiles from the middle and pick which slot to put them in your play mat. What sets this apart is taking a color causes the remaining options to morph and the remaining turns to change, with players having to account for not gorging on too many tiles and also not being stuck last with a bad grab. Lovely chunky components that look like chocolates, and a nice feel reminiscent of Tetris-like puzzlers. The elegance helps it here and keeps the options clear.

Really enjoy this abstract tile laying game.  Seems that concentrating on the 7 point columns might be a good strategy, although the 10 points for 5 same color on your grid may be good too, although seems difficult.

Ok - found out we were making this a bit harder on ourselves, and that was why no 10pt bonuses.  Since you can play the same color on multiple areas, this makes that a bit easier...our "variant" made it thinkier and prone to a bit more AP to ensure you didn't mess yourself up for BIG negative points.

Got to play with 4 players, and very fun still.  Enjoy at all player counts.

I didn't think I would be saying this, but out of the 13 different board games we got for Christmas in my family, this one might end up being my favorite.  It's so elegant and simple, yet there can be a lot of strategy involved to maximize your score.  I played this Christmas day with two 86 year old women and my 14 year old son and got destroyed by them.  Then I introduced it to my two adult sons and played many games with them and their younger brother.  So simple to teach.  Even the scoring, which I've seen some complain about, was picked up immediately by the older and younger crowd.
My only complaint, which is the case with many games that have come out recently, is the game board.  I'll end up spending half again what the game costs to buy acrylic overlays for it when they come out like I did with Blood Rage, Great Western Trail and Terraforming Mars.  Charge me more and give me a Scythe like game board.  One small bump and you can wipe out everything.  My 26 year old got frustrated with it and started keeping score on a piece of paper.  It's not going to take away from my overall score, but its frustrating.

It's okay... I definitely think it's over-hyped after playing it. I feel like Sagrada hits the same category for me, but I actually get to complete something. With Azul, as soon as a Player hits 5 in a row (which can literally be after 5 rounds), the game is over and you end up with a spotchy board that feels incomplete. I would have much rather seen a variant where you complete the entire board. The components are beautiful, and there is a lot to be said about the beauty of the simplicity here, but it's just not my favorite game in this genre.

Might upgrade this to 10 if it stands the test of time or downgrade it to 7 or 8 if it gets repetitive.

Initial impressions after a few games. Quick, tactical game with a sheer elegance, a short playtime, that can appeal to a vast audience of casual and gamers alike. Great production and a fair price.

Plays very differently with 2, 3 and 4 players. The 2-player game has a strategic depth that the 4-player game lacks, but two aspects do not come into play with 2 - set bonus are hard to get and tile penalties are rarely important enough to play a role. I wish the two-player game went a little longer as the player board is half empty when the game ends, but I also wish the 4-player game was more controlled and more strategic. 

I love it right now and it seduces everyone who tries it around me, but I can't say if it will bear repeated play. It feels like the only valid strategy right now is to pick a column and try to fill it, then play vertically and horizontally around it. We'll see.

It's your run of the mill abstract but the passive interactions this game offer puts it in a different class.

[Chinese Edition] {Abstract; pattern-building; optimal 2p} Azul is an enjoyable fun abstract game.  Player interaction is good.  Decision is rewarding, yet not brain-teasing.

It is easy to teach and set up the game.  The game flow is fast.  Scoring is simple too.  Strategy is clear.  Tactical moves are meaningful.  This game is particular challenging for a two-player game.

The components are not as pretty as what my friends said.  The tiles are sturdy.  The boards should have nudges to hold the tiles.

I don't like the variant. The original board is more challenging.

A nice, reasonably weighty game to play with the wife. The colorful and extremely amazing production quality helps to get the wife to try it out. 

The wife likes the game, and I like that the game is fast and easy to setup and to play. 

At 4 players the game is pretty interactive, with players trying to get the tiles they want and also to attempt to deny the other players as well. It gets tense and silent when everyone is thinking hard or observing hard whenever it's a player's turn to pick.

The default side has enough meat to it that it provides us with tough decisions and the usual thinking groans that we like in our game. Not sure when before we attempt the blank advanced side to up the challenge.

RATING: 7
tl;dr: solid abstract

This is one of those games that can stand up to [thing=9674][/thing] and [thing=25669][/thing] as a multiplayer abstract that appeals to both families and gamers. Again we have nice chunky bits and easy rules that lead to interesting choices. The main difference is that in this game everyone creates their own tableau, and the interaction comes from competition for tiles from the main pool. When do you take what tiles from the tiles in the middle or the big pool that is created by the left over tiles there?
I do have a couple of thoughts on the bits though. For the most part this has been put together with attention to detail, as one would expect from this publisher. But why does every player have their own scoring track that is easy to screw up when you reach for bits in the center of the table? A separate board with 1 score track for all players would have been better. Also: the red and the blue don't have any pattern printed on them, and it looks a bit like someone forgot to print them. It's a weird choice.
But all in all a solid, enjoyable game!

Super accessible filler that plays wildly differently at 2p vs. 3/4p. 

At 2p, it's a knives-out, hate-drafting brawl. Mean as hell, interactive and delightful and amazing. [i]Great[/i] game at 2p.

At 3-4p the game becomes more about your own plans since you can't account for multiple people with more tiles to choose from. It becomes an average filler.

This game is best as a zero-sum 2p cage fight. The triangulation of the extra players blunts what makes this game so interesting.

3-4p: 5

I'm not a big abstract fan, but after seeing a lot of praise for Azul I had to give it a try.  The components are great and are probably the biggest reason to play the game, to be honest.  It's quite satisfying to collect these tiles and arrange them on your board in a nice colorful pattern.

The gameplay itself is also interesting and can be quite cutthroat.  You are trying to collect sets of similar tiles, which you can then transfer to a 5x5 grid on your tableau.  Sets of 1 go to the first row, sets of 2 go to the 2nd row, etc., but you can only make one of each set per round, you can only have one of each color per row, and one of each color per column.  It felt a bit more tactical and less strategic than other abstracts, because the available tiles completely reset from round to round.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed it and this is one of the few abstracts that I would be happy to play again.

Sometimes you play a game just so that you can dismiss it mentally, put it aside and say to yourself "Yeah, thought so". I was so sure, Azul wouldn't be my cup of tea and I only wanted to play it so I would be confirmed in my plans not to expand my collection with this title. 
It backfired on me. The game is beautiful, both visually and mechanically. And it probably has one of the most elegant ways to negate a start player advantage. It scales well with any player count. It is not boring. It is a very pleasant puzzle. It's got a lean set of rules  but nonetheless a very satisfying gameplay. All this puts it high on my Wanted-list.
--------------------------------------------------
Upped my rating. I keep thinking about this game and its current unavailibility doesn't help. Naturally I preordered and - not so naturally - I am searching where to get those joker tiles (I didn't even play with those and won't get the game til end of march. MARCH? Noooooooo!) I even dismissed my "7 points max for abstracts"-rule for this game! This game will last. It will be played at every table, no matter the gaming preference. It'll replace Bingo,Backgammon and the likes in retirement homes and it'll make the toughest TI3 Sardak Norr player melt before its beauty. Your kids will ask for it. Over and over. And you won't mind. In fact you won't get tired of their asking for it. It'll be the game people play that don't play board games. Spiel des Jahres? At least a very strong contender

It's great to see abstracts becoming hot. I'm not convinced this is the best to have come out in recent years but the production is great and it's a tactile pleasure to play the game. I worry a bit that you basically have to focus on filling the top three lines every round to win and I would have loved a bit more interaction. Messing with your opponent is only a side thing that isn't going to win you the game.

Azul is an excellent game, the rules are simple and the game is very quick. Just choose a set of tiles from plate or the central area and queue them up to be added to the wall. The scoring at the end of every round is reasonably simple, but the end-game bonuses add an enjoyable layer of strategy to the game. It's really simple to play but has a surprising amount of depth. I imagine an experienced player will usually beat a newcomer. The double sided player boards add even more replayability to the game.

A couple of downsides I can see are that sometimes the punishments for going last in a round can effectively knock a player out of the running, and there may be also bit bit of a runaway leader issue but it's such a quick game that neither of these issues spoils the game too much. Very much looking forward to playing again.

Initial thoughts: As a designer, I'm a sucker for games that look nice. The hefty tiles and overall aesthetic of this game caught my eye. I was hesitant after hearing about the possibility of hate drafting and conflict in two player games since I'd largely be playing it with my wife.

After 2 plays: It's a great game and somewhat exceeded my expectations. It's the perfect weight for a relaxing evening. My wife loves tetris and enjoyed the puzzle. She gets her own board to focus on, but the drafting mechanic means your opponents moves also matter. I can see how hate drafting and conflict can enter the game. How much that impacts a gaming table is based on who's sitting around it.

It has some basic good ideas and nice appearance. But it's boring. The game has problem a la "leader bashing" and "kingmaking". I mean, in the last round people start to play against others, so the game completely lacks its competition. This game is not fine as duel, because there is only one layer of interaction. Compare Azul to Patchwork, that has two levels: tiles' circle and time track. In addition, Azul's interaction in duel is quite simple. May be checkers are more difficult :D
Not satisfactory.

An abstract game about creating contiguous rows and columns of tiles to score points, which once you realise the consequences of being left with unwanted tiles, would probably play reasonably well.

Meh. I'll give it another try with the advanced (empty) side of the board but don't expect I'll ever be a fan. A game this light needs to be more tense/exciting to get traction with me.

Upon opening the box, I discovered a small number of components with manufacturing defects.  I sent them an email on their website form and they responded by replacing them.  So not only is the game a beautiful experience, dealing with the company itself is as well.  This is a great contrast to some other companies we know (cough... cough... Asmodee).

Certainly a beautiful production, and the gameplay is incredibly smooth. Love those tactile tiles!

The scoring in our first game was close, and I felt the decisions did have some weight as you went along. There were moments where I had to decide about long-term versus short-term, but I also had to protect from junk tiles.

To be sure, this game is abstract to the max, and it's not really blowing any minds, but it's quite easy to play, much in the same way as Century: Spice Road. I'm probably giving it more props for the produciton and ease of play than the gameplay, but on balance it's quite good.

This is a great game. It has pattern recognition with a great deal of interaction. The game is aesthetically pleasing to look at and the components are good. This is an easy game to teach but there is a lot to think about which keeps you engaged in the game.

The trick of the game is developing your board while trying to prevent your opponents from getting tiles they need to develop their board. Choosing the right factory and placing the titles into the common area is an important choice. Do you take tiles just to block your opponents? Heck yeah! Do you want to see your opponent stuck taking extra tiles and taking negative points? Indubitably. Beware as the tiles become less available. If you do not have an area open for tile placement you can get stuck with taking tiles you cannot use.

This surprised me! I don't normally get a chance to play such abstract Euros since my groups don't favour them, but this was good. Tightly balanced, but no catchup mechanism so you'll definitely want to play this a few times. Lovely blend of tactics and strategy, and the game on the shorter side so it's a definite winner! Shame it only goes to 4 players but I can't imagine it with more.

An instant classic. Great artwork, well constructed. Simple enough for anyone to learn but great replayability.

Excellent tile-laying game. Use as a gateway game, as well as a brutal contest between gamers.

R√°pido de explicar y de jugar, tiene dos modos de juego, componentes buenos y vistosos, partidas r√°pidas que dejan ganas de repetir, parece que escala bien... en resumen, tiene todos los elementos que hace que pueda ver mucha mesa.

We played this again today, my wife and myself.

We don't think this is a game for 4 players and certainly not when there are people with AP.  Maybe three players but even then ...

We enjoy it VERY much with the two of us (but that's how we paly most of our games).

I was apprehensive about Azul, but my wife and I enjoyed it at two players. It's gorgeous, easy to learn, and takes a surprising amount of thought.

The Guys surprised me with this one as a post-Christmas gift of sorts. Oh happy day! (They then thoroughly trounced me in it.)

I really like the ever-tough decisions, and how that plays into what you leave your opponents, and what you think they might leave for you as a result. Scoring is a bit tedious (but not difficult), begging for either this game to be an app, or for there to be a helper app that lets you photograph your wall and be told your score.

The tiles look cool, but they are too polished with a little too much rounding, resulting in slippery handling on a level with wet bars of soap. Now imagine trying to pick up numerous little wet bars of soap to arrange in a perfect grid on a flat, glossy surface. So, that's a sometimes very destructive downside.

All in all, a nice game I'd probably be happy to play any time; however, for once, perhaps playing with sticky fingers is encouraged?

Nagyon sz√©p √©s kellemes absztrakt j√°t√©k, sz√≠vesen j√°tszom majd m√©g vele. Mondan√°m, h chillin' az eg√©sz, de az√©rt van benne n√©mi kisz√∫r√°sfaktor, el√©g durv√°n lehet a m√∂g√∂tt√ºnk l√©v≈ëket bosszantani. Persze fontos, h els≈ësorban magunkra koncentr√°ljunk, de ezzel az√©rt nem √°rt tiszt√°ban lenni. Ahogy azzal is, h 4-en el√©gg√© el tud h√∫z√≥dni, ha van egy p√°r AP-s j√°t√©kos a csapatban. De ezek az√©rt apr√≥s√°gok, a j√°t√©k rendben van, absztrakt-fanok ne hagyj√°k ki.

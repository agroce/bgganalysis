RATING: 4
Played only once with the full complement of 8, which lead to some blow-out scoring rounds.  I really like the clue-giving idea, though - they need to be gettable, but not too gettable - and suspect my rating will go up when I play this again with fewer players.

surprisingly good party game, also works excellent as a point of interest while chatting with friends in a living room.  great to keep around on the coffee table.  breezy game, you can size your answers to people based on specific knowledge like musical references.  surprising how much you learn while you play too.  if not facts, then about the people with whom you're playing.

RATING: 6
A decent party game that plays in a fairly short timeframe which is nice.  It seems like it would play much better with people you know really well, because you can predict what they will know and not know.  I like the challenge of creating a guessable definition without everyone knowing what you are talking about.  It's an OK game, but not one that is so revolutionary unique that I need to play it frequently.

Fun party game. Rules are very elegant.  I really like the betting variant

RATING: 10
Outstanding game in the vein of Password: one person sees a word and gives a clue to it; the other players guess. Right answers score a point for the guesser, the giver gets a point per right guess -unless- everyone or no one got it right.

Highest recommendation if you can find it.

Great little game, plays well and quickly.  Excellent for the car.  Just having a Thingamajig around to help with conversation with socially awkward people is a good idea.  And by socially awkward people, I'm referring to anyone who's actually reading this on bgg.

RATING: 8
Fun with clues, annoyingly fun party game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Components: Simple contraption.  Simple chips. The word should remain visible on the device for longer.

Experience: More difficult than fun.  It is challenging to be the clue-giver, and interesting to see what things people come up with that match the clue, but it's actually hard work to construct an almost-perfect clue. There is a fatal flaw with the endgame condition. Players who have more turns before the game ends will have a strong advantage to win; the game should be played such that all players have an equal number of turns.

Eagerness to Play Again: Eventually

No matter how easy some clues are, in some groups, there is too often somebody to miss the answer, which screws up the scoring system.

This game almost always results in a lot of laughter.  It can be very hard to think of a good "vague" clue.  But it's a very fun game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very surprising when no one got my hints. Also surprising when someone DID get my hints. We didn't use strict "definition" format. Hint-giving is harder than you'd think, like trying to come up with a semi-difficult riddle.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a brilliant game, made more brilliant by the fact that it plays equally well with people of all abilities.  Absolutely must be played with the "'this OR that' is not allowed" variant.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Players take turns thinking up definitions for words given to them by the electronic Thingamajig. You score a point for every player who correctly guesses your word. But if everyone gets it, you score nothing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
It's probably an okay product for the mass market party game audience.   It uses the same tired mechanic where a person must give a clue that some people (but not everybody) will figure out.   The little electronic gizmo gives it that mass market appeal, where a deck of word cards could have worked too.   Nothing here to get excited about, but it's not my kind of game either.   Montage or Codenames pretty much make Thingamajig and its ilk obsolete.

I normally hate word games but I actually like this one. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Press the button on the gadget and come up with a definition that matches the word.  Make it a bit vague so not everyone guesses the word.  You receive a chip for every correct guess except if everyone guesses it (then you get no chips).  Other players get chips for guessing the word correctly.  Play until all the chips run out.  Simple & fun game/social activity that accommodates up to 8 players and requires a bit of creativity.

RATING: 8
[Word Game, Party Game] [6+P:8] And this 8 rating is just for the base game. There are several variants on the RNR site that we haven't had a chance to try yet. Very nice word-based party game in a portable form. So what if the Thingamajig looks really cheap, and you can hardly read the thing in dim lighting? Thingamajig is a word-based game, so a generally similar vocabulary level is assumed among the players. Due to the game structure an intrinsically handicapped player (English not a primary language, or maybe kids) can affect performance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Clever little game.  You have to be obvious and devious at the same time.  The better you know the group, the more you can direct, or redirect, the word you're trying to get them to guess.  Easy to learn, easy to play, open-ended style game play.  This is fun.

RATING: 9
The idea behind the game is to construct clues that will allow some (preferably many), but not all of the other players to guess your word.  This initially sounded very stupid to me, but it actually works really well.  There are many different approaches cluegivers can take: clues with many possible answers, basing the clue on bits of trivia, using riddle-like wordplay, ambiguously worded clues, etc.  Players are also rewarded for being good guessers, since each correct guess earns a chip.

We often play a variation in which guessers can wager an extra chip on his answer: 2 chips if correct, loss of one chip if incorrect.  I like this variation because it discourages the "bit of trivia that I'm hoping one person doesn't know" type of clue, and encourages more mysterious clues.

Seems like a combo of Times up and Balderdash almost. 

Someone gets a word, gives out a clue, other people try to guess the word. Points are given. Repeat.  

Should be alright, variants apparently make it more fun.

When I first read the rules, I thought this game was too simple to be any fun. It ended up being an OK party game. Not as much pure fun as Time's Up, but we've played that so much, it was nice to throw in a new game to add some variety.

Another game with a gimmick. This one you press the gimmick and it illuminates a word you then use for the round. OK party game.

RATING: 5
This game is decent fun, as long as you aren't playing in a group that includes children (because you can give clues that go over their heads) and those who haven't lived in the US for while (for the same reason as above).  It doesn't get a lot of play, but the mechanism of trying to give good clues, but not too good is interesting.

RATING: 6
I liked playing with a large group better than Dave Arnott did.  In Thingamajig, a player will score a point for everyone who guesses his word - as long as there is at least one wrong guess.  With 8 players, it&#039;s possible to get a blowout score of six in a round.  Yes, that can be imbalancing - but what may be weak in game terms works well in &quot;fun&quot; terms.  It really feels like a coup when you can get exactly one person to mess up.  I give more weight to this fun factor in a party game, whereas I might want to fine tune it more if it were a strategy game.

RATING: N/A
The word-generating gizmo is neat, but there's not much of a game here. This could just as easily be played by (a) using a Catchphrase disc (b) writing words on paper or (c) having the describer simply choose his/her own word.

RATING: 8
Smart, little party game. The electronic toy is simply a gimmick to replace a deck of guessing words, but here's a case where the simple technology is put to great use. The attractive design of the thingamajig helps, too (it could've been a very boring box with a button on it). A little tough for kids to play with adults, though the elegant scoring system helps to even that out some. Most fun with more players, though more challenging with fewer.

I've taken the Thingamajig along on car & train trips to just give & guess clues with my kids. It reinforces language skills the way other games reinforce math.

RATING: 6.5
Simple and fun.  One problem -- the entire group should have roughly the same vocab skills.  We played with an adult group and one 12-year-old, so it was fairly easy to craft definitions that left only her scratching her head (best scenario since you want lots of people guessing correctly, but not EVERYONE).

Clever game of trying to get most (but not all) of the other players to guess your clue.  Kind of reminds me of making clay sculptures in Barbarossa that won't be guessed too easily.  First game was with five players. Seems like playing with any less than five would be a problem.

I'm a sucker for these types of games and this one is a lot of fun. I like that you can be as creative or as blunt as you like with the clues. I did find that in the game I played with 5 players (and this would be the case if there were more, too) the best bet was to give something very obvious because the chances are that one person will be thrown off because he/she tries to read more into it or is just not familiar with the reference. Trying to get too cute can be deadly as you risk no one figuring out your clever, but obscure clue.

It's like reverse dictionary, where you try to give a vague definition that hopefully just 1 person will get wrong and everyone else gets. Almost an impossible line to toe, but it's marketed as a party game so it's needed to be played in the right spirit.

RATING: 9
A party game that has people making crossword-puzzle-caliber clues in order to have most other players guess a word. What makes this game shine is that people give their clues in a variety of styles and narratives: punny, funny, simple, complex, meta, story-telling, cryptic, etc. I'm glad I finally got to play this. 

Probably best with 5 or more players.

First couple of playings have made me realise that more than 4 players will probably be better, and that some sort of time limit must be imposed. It's a shame that the gadget doesn't have an inbuilt audio countdown, as this would improve the playings and rating immensely.

Haven&#039;t played yet, but appears to be something like group password, where you try to get everyone to answer correctly except for one (otherwise you score nothing).

I'm good at this one - always a reason to play a party game! You need to come up with a clue that ALMOST everyone knows the answer to. But I'm better at guessing the answer. But like "Family Feud" in that way. Also fun playing with crossword fans who like crypic clues. I'm good for around three rounds at a time.

A very fun party game. Cons: Downtime between clues can take a little while, and I personally wouldn't want to play this in a group of people that I didn't know well. However, with the right group, definitely a good time.

A hidden gem amongst word-guessing party games. Very unique - you want to give clues to a word that most (but not all) will guess correctly. You get a point for each correct guess but if everyone guesses correctly you receive no points. Wow! What an interesting variation! This is more challenging than you initially expect.

I've actually only played the game once, a number of years ago, and I don't really remember how much I enjoyed it.  It seems like it could probably be fun.  Mostly I just love the little electronic random-word thing which comes with the game.  Grand fun!  I had said at the time (when I played it) that if I ever saw this game for cheap, I'd get it just for the Thingamajig.  And I did!  Snail.  Generator.  Jump.  Bachelor.  Aura.  Eraser.  I'd bump it to, like, 7.5 if the thingamajig was right-handed instead of left.

RATING: 4
Put a bunch of thingamachips in the center (# varies by player#). On your turn, hit the button on the Thingmajig: it'll show a word. Define it for everyone, who each write down the word they think you're describing. Everyone who's correct gets a Thigamachip. You get 1chip/correct player, UNLESS every player was correct -- in which case you get NONE. The game ends when all thingamachips are gone; the player with the most chips wins.

So you're trying to make your definitions just a little vague, so somebody will get it wrong. But the words are pretty simple and it just doesn't work that well. Or if it does, everyone is just sitting there thinking: it's more work than fun.

RATING: 8
A fun concept that has now proven to wear well over time.  I've played this more than a dozen times and will no doubt be back for more.  I do wish there were about ten times more words stored in the gadget, but that's my only criticism of the game.  P.S.  Well, now I see why there aren't that many words on the gadget:  the battery runs out (and it's some weird kind of battery I've never seen before) so you can't keep playing with it anyhow.  Too bad.  It's a good game and I hope we'll see a better quality edition sometime.

Pretty fun party game. The more people the better (>5). The active player pushes the button and the Thingamajig shows a word. The active player can give as many clues as he wants to get the other players to guess the answer. The active player gets a chip for each correct guess, unless all the other players guess correctly and he gets nothing. Players who guess correctly get a chip as well. Very challenging game to get the people who are behind to get the right answer while avoiding getting the leader to guess it correctly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A game that's much harder than it looks. The game is best when people don't give clues crafted toward/away from individuals (inside references and such), but played "correctly" it's a top tier clue giving game.

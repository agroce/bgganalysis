Bought that one after playing Edel, Reich & Stein.  that is now unfortunately out of print.

Basari looked similar but turned out to be not quite as good.

Gosh, what a tight game!  Definitely some of the same feel as the boardgame, but it seemed to be missing a little something.  Great size box too.

Gran filler de negociación y pujas, para mi más rápido y más divertido que Bohnanza. 

Cajita mucho más reducido que la de su hermano mayor  Basari, pero sin perder la esencia del juego.

Card game that uses a system that reminds a bit this in Havana.  You use 1 out of 4 action cards to basically obtain jewels to score majorities.
The major problem comes in the way ties are resolved.  Quite fiddly (at least we were explained)

I remember Basari as a better game, but maybe time goes by and today Basari seems as boring, as this cardgame.

RATING: 6.5
Played with 5 players, I guess is the worst player count: the D action felt strange "change one gem for two gems". In one round, one player made that action each turn changing blues/greens for reds/yellows while the other players strive to get workers, points or gems. 

I think this is a very good game in a small package, with 3 or 4 players I'm sure it shines.

Looking forward to play it again.

What a neat game!  I want A, but if Joe calls A, we have to fight about it and I doubt he'll call B, so I'll call B and we'll both be happy.  But wait, what about Jane?  She might call B or C and if I have to fight anyway, I'd rather fight for A... decisions, decisions.

Other than that, it's a simple set collection/majority filler card game.  Good and quick... but it's the double thought that makes it a keeper.

Heard about this game on Ludology episode 134 - There's No "I" in Team.

Sen-Foong Lim (one of the designers of Akrotiri) mentioned it in the lightning round as his favorite game that he didn't design. He said it was best with three players.

I looked it up because I hadn't heard about it. The gameplay sounded interesting.

I found a copy on the BGG Geek Market.

We've played once with four players. I really like the negotiation mechanism when two players choose the same action.

I'm not sure how it works at other player counts - it sounds like three players might be the best - losing an action because three players chose it seems like too big of a penalty.

RATING: 7
Based on 1 play with 3 players:

This game is either going to go way up or way down in rating. Because we had a LOT of fun our first play, but there was also one big ugly blemish that I suspect will be a recurring issue in the game. Now it's just a matter of whether or not all the fun that precedes it and the short playtime make up for the sucky endgame.

So here's the scoop: this is a really fun short little bluffing game. There's as much mind tricks, second-guessing, and exciting reveals as you can get in this short a time frame and this small a box. It's all gasps and laughs, all the way down.

The only problem is scoring is completely open information, so most likely every round will end with two people mathing out exactly the best deal to put themselves ahead of the third person. This is kind of acceptable, if anticlimactic, in the first two rounds... but when it's the end of the game unless you have enough gems to strongarm yourself into first you're just playing kingmaker.

Our first game came down to my boyfriend and I having to choose which of us would win the game. All three of us just got annoyed and called it a draw. I sort of wonder if maybe gems should be hidden.

Also I suspect the scaling is sucky in this game. 3p felt perfect, I really don't have much of a desire to try 4 or 5.

RATING: 4
This one is a forgettable game with not much going on. I don't think there are many decisions to make during the game, and it just feels kind of boring... Also, while the idea of double thinking is cool (regarding which card you want to play), the actual outcome felt a little too random when more players played the same card as yourself and you therefore got nothing. When a single other player plays the same card like you, the negotiation is decent and probably the best part of the game, but other than that the game isn't that interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Easy to teach and setup negotiation game. Has luck and also requires calculations to play competitively. Rating might go even higher if luck can be mitigated sufficiently. Needs more plays but is a keeper anyway.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
One of the things that makes this game interesting is that everyone has their own card each round, so you have to keep looking at other players' cards. Even if someone has an obvious choice (e.g. 7 points while other players' cards have 4 or fewer), sometimes other players have an incentive to coax some gems out of him in order to allow him to take it.

Basari is a simultaneous action selection card game with a bidding element. Each turn of the round, each player will be provided with a card that contains 3 pieces of information. It will have workers (can be a source of points and triggers the end of the round), gems (potentially a source of points and used for bidding), and straight up points. Players will select a card stating which of the 3 scoring options they want to pursue this round. Though, with workers, you get a random number of workers through the card draw. If you are the only one to select a specific action, you just do it. If 3 or more players select the same action, neither player does the action. If 2 people choose the same action, there is an escalating bidding using gems between the two players. When someone can't/doesn't want to beat his opponent during the bidding, he can take the opponents bid and that opponent takes the action. The  bidding gets more interesting the more diversity between the player's gems. After a turn, each player draws another card and covers up everything but the workers on the previous one. The game is played over 3 rounds. It's quick, it's easy, and will get people talking about their birthdays/age (play the game or read the rules and you'll find out why). I've never played the original Basari, but this game is a decent filler. I think Visby is better in the same vein though.

This is a wonderful small-box bidding game, with a side order of negotiation. It's comparable with [thing=172][/thing] in terms of simple rules leading to satisfying tactical interplay. So cheap, and so portable, it should be in everyone's collection.

Bought in June 2016.

Finally played this.  What a fun little game.  I feel like having 15 workers should maybe be worth more than just 12 points, but idk.  But it's light, it's interesting and seems to hold way more depth you might expect at first glance.  A winner.

Quite enjoyable and look forward to playing again.  I think most of us 'got it' by the end of the game and would certainly play it differently when bartering with the gems. Gave away to friends - Christmas 2015.

I'm pretty tough on card game conversions of existing boardgame favorites--they need to do more than come in a small package. In this case, I love the original boardgame, and the card game only suffers from feeling almost the same, and being no shorter. So why play it? Well, it's inexpensive, and it's small. That's something. But I miss the attractive board & classic components.

This one didn't really hit big with my group. You get punished for making the same choice as other players. Which doesn't bother me as much in Raj, but here it does. I guess the game tries being more than it is.

Will keep for now, maybe it'll grow on me.. or there might be a good variant around.

RATING: N/A
A simultaneous action selection game in which players are vying for three categories of rewards from round to round. When players' interests conflict, a forced negotiation ensues, resulting in one player paying the other to take the action. Points are scored via majority, set collection, and via outright awards. The game combines a lot of bluffing and negotiation into 30 minutes and fits into a small box. A nice design.

[b]Basari[/b] was sold via auction 7/10/15.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Even though Basari is no longer in our collection, it is a game I'm willing to play anytime. I think you need at least four for the game to shine and unfortunately my family was meh on it so I traded my copy. Thankfully a buddy of mine has a copy, but I'm not sure he's even played it yet. Excellent bidding/negotiation game that would be perfect for a pub![/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- The best negotiation/bluffing filler I've played [i](games last about 20 minutes tops and it is easy to teach)[/i].
- Amazing how much game has been condensed down into a deck of cards and some jewels, perfect pub/cafe game. 
- My favorite mechanism in the game: 1 person selects an action - they get it, 2 people - they negotiate who will get it by giving gems to the other player, 3 or more people - no one gets anything!
- You constantly second guess every choice because you are not only worried about what action you want to take, but what other people may be interested in (too many people choose it and you get zilch)[/i].

Simple bluffing game to try and get points in the 3 rounds. It is the card game of the board game Badari. I have yet to play the board game but I am definitely interested in trying it now that I have played the card game and found it enjoyable. I would play again. It might be a tad too long but played nicely. I like the simultaneous card selection mechanic it is one of my favorites.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I've never played Edel, Stein & Reich, so I can't compare this to it, but I quite liked the Basari card game. There's a bit too much guessing/hoping involved in the card playing and a bit too much thinking in the bidding, so that the gameplay feels a bit incongruent. Maybe there should be the tiniest bit of hidden information or randomness in the scoring so the game doesn't end in "if I bid this and she accepts then player A will win so she must raise with that but if I accept than she will win and she knows I can't do that so instead she might raise with that which means D will win so I should probably bid this instead, ..."

But a very pleasant filler none-the-less.

Basari: Das Kartenspiel does exactly what I hoped: condenses almost all the gameplay of the board game into a tiny package. Like the original and Edel, Stein & Reich, I enjoy both the psychology of the blind action selection and the structured bartering.

Good card game version of the boardgame. Play-style is the same, just without the board & dice, keeping only cards & gems.
Also adds the possibility of a fifth player, but have not tried it with 5 so far.

I've only played this once, so won't score it yet. But honestly, it might be worth an 8. Our whole group had a great time with this (and I've heard their second play was just as good).

A lot of game in a small package. It has a lot of fun elements - nicely done negotiation (circumstantial, not overpowering), push-your-luck, proper strategy etc. And it resulted in some amusing battles between players, with plenty of "no - don't help him!"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A clever simultaneous choice game. Players choose options. If three or more players choose the action none of them benefit. If two players chose they bid for the action, and if one gets it the player acts as normal. Various points scoring options are available of which the most valuable are for having the most gems at the end of each round.

tl;dr: where have I seen that before?

This game is - obviously - a new take on [thing=14][/thing], which I haven't played. However, I have played [thing=5781][/thing]. I don't remember too much about it, but they obviously share the gem trading mechanism. And that is a pretty cool mechanism. In this game that mechanism is combined with simultaneous action selection using cards to select one of 3 actions. And it's pretty fun. Unless you get hosed out of action after action because 2 or more other players chose the same. That's part of the game however, so it doesn't bother me too much.
I quite enjoyed this, but I'm not sure how much I'm going to play this.

With all of the Basari, Edel Stein & Reich games, it does feel that they're all very similar and often whichever one you played first is your favourite. For me, the card game version adds portability at the cost of increased randomness in the travelling option (we've always used the variant movement between turns in Basari). It's a good game, but I never need to play it again as I own Basari which for me is the better game.

If nothing else, having more gems makes for more opportunities to make interesting offers to players.

It's a toss-up as to whether I prefer this to Edel, Stein, und Reich. On the one hand, this design is much more slim and compact, but having *everything* be a known quantity in ESR really helps in the double-think (special cards in the latter are face up before players choose actions, drawing a card for additional workers in the former is done blindly AFTER actions are selected AND after bartering is done).

All that said, this is an excellent, compact "Wine in Front of Me" game that's clever and lucky in equal measure. It's a damn shame it didn't get a US release as I'm sure it would have gotten a lot more popular otherwise.

Also, I cannot fathom why they decided to name subsequent printings of this the EXACT SAME as the original board game.

Completely replaced 'Basari' (the board game) for me. The negative on the other side of the coin, of course, is that it's basically the same game, so it's not much of a new entity. Still, I'm much happier to have this little box than the full board, dice, etc.

Updated from 6->7, the rules for this were initially atrocious, until the 2nd volume in the series (Infidel) came and fixed/clarified alot of the issues. It is now quite a fast paced low complexity GBOH'ish game. Would get a higher rating if the battles were not so one sided (great for historical learning tho).

Nice looking game, which plays fairly smoothly. I really don't care for the large number of die roll modifiers required for combat. The scenarios are all unbalanced and the special rules tend to make them more so, rather than balancing them out.

Solo only so far. Infidel is more balanced, but this is simpler and faster. 

I don't like Courtrai. Attempting to attack through the gap in the ditch leads to a very very slow battle.

RATING: 7.3
My first proper hex and counter wargame.
Underestimated the setup time. Boy, does this take long to set up...
The "simple" and short rules leave much to be desired, a lot of common situations - multiple attackers, charging - are vague or underdeveloped. Definitely not easy to slip into.

Fairly easy and fast paced game easy to master in its general rules. I'm personally fascinated by the warfare in medieval age and I think Berg has done a good job in rendering the general idea. I wish the maps were bigger and game had a larger scale, overall. The system of the standards works well. The position and defense of the standards is crucial for the game. Combat (fire, shock and charge) are fairly easy to learn. The game takes inspiration from some rule of Great Battle of Ancient History. Thus, gamers familiars with that series will find Men of Iron both easy to play and enjoyable on a medium/high standard.

The system is a Simple GBOH of Simple GBOH, the problem is most battles are one-sided if played per historical rules, such as that they were. And you don't want to play 'em non-historically, do you?

RATING: N/A
Rules are fairly simple although there are a lot of changes to the rules to be found in the living rules. After a first play longbow men seem very powerful - they can take out strong defensive units at a distance. Anyone on foot stands little chance in engaging them because of reaction fire.

RATING: 4
Interesting game and good graphics, BUT TOO MUCH LUCK in the activation die roll. My army was smashed since my opponent activated units about 5 times more than I did (and leader activation rates were similar). I only stood there when my opponent was getting fun kicking my units around. This is not funny... nor historical... :-(
Maybe better if activation rate is used as drm for both the gamers rolling an activation die. Even better if a minimal activation is guaranteed (for example one activation bonus if other player's leaders were all activated in a row).

This game system has become one of my favorites. The back and forth nature of activations, along with all of the Reaction Fire, Return Fire, and Counter-charging going on makes for a game with a lot of player interaction, unpredictability, and excitement. Bring on the sequels, Mr. Berg!

Not really deserving of a 1 - but I doubt I will ever play it again.  The system is almost too simple, and gameplay is so harsh to the attacker that play feels stilted.  Taking the extra time to learn GBH seems a better choice.  Might be a good choice for solitare play.

A fairly fun, fast game.  The defender usually has little to do beyond readjusting their line to allow for units that break.  As a solo game, it is fairly strong and provides a nice look at this age of combat.

Medieval wargame - now you don't say that very often. Scenarios weighted to run similarly to the original result, but there's optional rules to make that more or less the case. Simple combat system and a nice activiation system for continuing / ctealing command activation. Played the Agincourt map so far, so I need to get some of the scenarios from the game proper to the table.

RATING: 7
Beer and pretzels (by my definition). Battles roll along with a relatively simple rule set, leaving most of your concentration on game play instead of rule look up. However, the battles themselves are often not that interesting with bungling knights hitting fixed infantry positions. Rally to banner positions instead of a designated mapside is quite interesting; something seen in later designs of GBoH (of which this is not).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Looks interesting, can't wait to play.

Have played Falkirk solo - a good introductory solo game (the Scots have no chance admittedly).

Things I loved - The historical sweep of the situation.  Berg is rightfully regarded very highly for this sort of game, and I love the history that is crafted into this game.  It really gives you an appreciation of the work that has gone into it and provides an interesting perspective on the history itself.

Enjoyable - I am glad I own this as it is a very solid short and straight-forward war game.  Good fun.

Update: Played Courtrai, I can only reiterate what I have already said - this is a solid little game that seems a fine introduction to this style of historical simulation game.  I like it a lot.

Men of Iron is a very good game of medieval tactical warfare.  It has some very surprising mechanics, but no complaints.  It adapts to solitaire play very easily.  The complaints about scenarios balance might be true if you are too ridged and competitive.  If you use some of the variations suggested in the scenarios, it works great.

This does play well and easy to play . . . once one understands how the issue of turn initiative works.  I don't agree that this takes only an hour to play, nearly everyone will use double that or more to finish.

Easy to play and actually pretty easy to teach, Men of Iron is a good "starter" wargame that has a lot of core hex-and-counter concepts as well as an appealing, interesting subject matter.  The system is surprisingly clean for a Berg design and tremendously playable.  Overall, a solid and attractive wargame that really deserves more table time.

RATING: 9
After playing my first Men of Iron scenario (Poitiers -- and losing really bad as the English; my opponent was unbelievably lucky on activation rolls), this has become a must-have. The game is simple without being simplistic. The rulebook is fairly clear (except shock and charge combat, which make more sense once you've seen the tables for them), and it's filled with interesting (and snarky) historical notes from the designer. Scenarios can easily be played in an evening (which is a big plus), and it looks like most of them would also be ideal for solitaire play.

July 16th, 2008 -- I played Nejara as the English last night and, despite losing to the Spanish, I greatly enjoyed the battle. Men of Iron is a fun, tense game that's not too complex nor too simplistic. Highly recommended. My rating stands. 9/10

RATING: 8
This one game that can surprise the panzer-pusher in your life that not all great armored combat games have treads.

Light rules, plays in half an afternoon, solo-friendly, and equates the longbow with the American Express card--don't leave home without it! Just good times through and through.

My recommendation on the historical version of the Falkirk scen ... play a portion of it solo once. Don't waste time setting up the whole Scottish formation. Just form up one schiltron, subject it to longbow fire, then shock/charge the distrupted remnants with some foot and horse units. That'll give you sense for the rules--then move on to the other scens.

RATING: 7
Un jeu plaisant avec un système qui semble simple mais qui demande de la pratique pour bien maîtriser les finesses.
Les interactions entre les différentes "troupes" sont indispensables pour pouvoir l'emporter, et ce n'est pas un élément intuitif et évident à saisir.
Les batailles sont un peu frustrantes car les règles spéciales sont trop nombreuses et sont destinées à a reproduire les résultats historiques...Crecy, Azincourt et Falkirk en particulier.
Les autres batailles sont plus disputées, ma préférée étant Bannockburn. A noter que les indications sur les camps favorisés sont parfois à mon avis fausses...Par exemple, les Ecossais à Bannockburn ne sont pas du tout si puissants que cela...

Not sure what Berg  thinks he is adding to the gaming industry except more mediocre titles that unwary gamers have to trudge through in order to find those few rare gems out there. Biggest complaint is the activation/continuity system, which makes for lopsided play (a Poiters battle I played saw the French activating 6 times in succession and basically destroying the English line before the English had their first  activation).

Difficult to rate, this one is. The system is fantastic, and probably deserves a 9 or 9.5 rating. It's simple, intuitive, plays quickly, and still retains a good period feel. There is chrome in just the right amounts. In play, it is a tad simpler than the Simple GBoH rules set. The designer's commentaries are great as usual. The only problem is the battles themselves, which are brutally lopsided, thus probably best played solitaire. I might try this using a rout point bid system.

RATING: 7
Nice system, but decidedly one-sided scenarios, which I guess is the point.  

The problem with the 2-player game is the continuation mechanism.  One side can keep going, turn after turn.  If your opponent does that, you're sunk!  Go solitaire on this one.  

One other problem is that the rules are unclear on several points, including what the facing of your target is if you attack down a hex spine.

Would play at the request of another, but probably wouldn't recommend it myself.  Most games seem to devolve to a Do-er against a Done-to.  Most players know what happens when Heavy Cavalry charges a shield-wall of pikes, or massed long-bows,and so few of the scenarios play out as history did.

Im a fellow sGBOH fan boy, and medieval ages are a second passion of mine next to Ancient time period warfare. So if your looking for a game that will both give you insight to that time period in terms of warfare AND a bit of a history lesson, then look no further because you cant go wrong with a Berg designed war game, period. 

Now lets move on to the components:

GMT does great jobs with that so kudos to them for another excellent looking game. 

The Battles:

almost all the battles are on an "offensive, defensive" posture. So one side is definately fortified up (with fewer units), while the offensive side has more units (more so that losing a few won't hurt them as much). But the thing is, after playing thru all the scenario's (including agincourt), the "losing" team historically can definately pull victories here. Its not as hard as many make it seem. All you have to do is analyze where the "weaknesses" are in the terrain where the defensive side is posted, and use it to your advantage because you already have the higher number of units (being on the offensive), so its only a matter of smart tactics + sheer dice rolls (of course) and you can make it happen. Even if your luck is horrible, victory is still attainable. The game like Great Battles of History series, will reward strategy and numberical superiority in combat (flanking, greater numbers, etc.)

The only reason why i didnt rate this game higher is due to the fact that its rule mechanics dont reach the perfection that is sBGOH (simple great battles of history). However its damn close. Outside of the minor quips with the rules (one in particular that states that not all units have a ZoC which i think should be changed because flanking an enemy is too easy...) the game itself is great. Again minor quibbles but it doesn't deteriorate from the fact that its a wonderfully designed game that gives you a nice glimpse into a fascinating time period. 

Solid 8.

Simple game that streamlines the best parts of the Great Battles of History Series into a visually pleasing package, even if the rules are ambiguous in several places. It has enough chrome to evoke period flavor but not enough to make you look through a rulebook for arcane rules and special modifiers. I would rate it higher but the scenarios, while playable and generally accurate, are not what I'd call espcially fun. Most feature a large horde attacking a well placed defender. This is in keeping with the theme, but not usually my idea of a fun wargame session. In other words I can play this game a few times a month but a steady diet of it would create indigestion.

RATING: 5
The Men of Iron system is guilty of being dynamic and totally bogus.  Basically, despite the hundreds of die-rolls per game, the key rolls are all about command, either keeping it (via continuation), or taking it.  If these rolls go against you or for you, you with occasionally win or lose not because of skills or abilities, but rather just because of luck.  However, that's not the greatest problem.

The greatest problem with the system is that down-time is hopelessly down.  There is no use planning your move because you may not get the next move.  So, your moves cannot be pre-planned which means downtime is worse than it might otherwise be.

The actual clash of arms...one unit against another, is excellent, easy to calculate, and fun to resolve, but loss of initiative can cause whole flanks to become extremely porus without there being any effect to the unit.  Not enough redemption for fun.

This title is probably the worst game in the series.  Any game that emphasizes how powerful massed slow boring infantry are against interesting cavalry attacks will inherently be less fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
just played an ahistorical agincourt: very fun! 
simple, effect oriented mechanics are the core of this game system that try to depict the problems faced by top ranks military commanders on the late medieval battlefield, expecially those related to morale effects and arms interaction. 
the design allows for an interesting amount of interaction between the players, nevertheless the absence of game turns not coupled with some mechanics limiting the activation of commands produce a notable distortion in the performance of the better commanded units. 
The scenarios chosen by berg in Men of Iron, in my opinion, aren't really interesting. 


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Men of Iron has a very concise 12 pages of rules (maybe 1 or 2 more pages with each scenario) that recreates something akin to 14th century combat. There's a good amount of historical "flavor" in the rules.  Scenarios are imbalanced but so were the actual battles.

RATING: 8
A fairly historical rendering of warfare in the age of charging armored knights and deadly long bows. Unique but not overly complex game mechanics do a fair job of capturing the flavor of Medieval combat. Rules cover mounted charges, counter charges, and charge reluctance. Unlike most games where units block the LOS of missile units, long bow units can fire over units. Players roll to activate units under a leader's wing. Play does not automatically pass back and forth between players but can be continued with the same player or seized by his opponent. Rules for unit facing apply. Units can only shock attack (close combat) or charge (if mounted) through their two frontal hexes. Missile units can fire out of their flank hexes. There are die roll bonuses for rear and flank attacks. 
Some of the scenarios are suitable for solitaire play. 
The historical backgrounds given in the Battle Book for each scenario are punctuated with witty lines such as, "...the French weren't going to charge head-on into the English defensive position. (The vanguard, mercenary Germans, were of a different mind and the instant they saw the English they put spur to horse and proved, yet again, that when honor supersedes intelligence, bad things happen.)" 
Overall the game mechanics work nicely. The original rulebook contained some ambiguities, but since the publication of the subsequent volume in the Men of Iron series, Infidel, the rules have been cleaned up. I originally gave this game a seven because of my issues with the clarity of the rules, but now that these issues have been resolved in the new edition, my rating has increased.

Like many other Berg designs, reading the rules and battlebook gets one all excited over the myriad details of the period that are included.  But when it's time to play, MoI becomes mechanical and repetitive.  Seemed as if it would appeal more to solitaire wargamers. For just a little more effort (and a lot more time), I'd recommend the equally-mechanical but more interesting GBoH stuff instead.  MoI is the first wargame that made me fall asleep during play...so try before you buy.

Suffers from a strange time compression effect, where one group can take multiple turns and another group just sits still while the battle rages around them. This completely breaks the simulation, whole units will never get to move in the battle. As a commander you have false choices where you will be forced to keep activating one commander and the others will just watch the battle with their units enjoying the show.

I like this one. It's simple, but full of hystorical details. It has all what you can want in a medieval game. Cavalry charges, deadly longbow and leaders. The importance of good leaders is clearly shown in the system. In addition interaction between the different weaposn system is also shown. The 6 battles portrayed are excellent inshowing the different tactical system of the different armies and clearly shown strengths and weaknesses of each.
Another great games from one of my favorite designers.

The simplicity and ease of the system is a plus, but the setup is a bit of a pain in the neck - probably would be alleviated somewhat via bagging according to command.  Can be very thrilling when activations continue for a while.

RATING: 4.5
The basic system is interesting but problematic. There is no stacking, so there is no place for mass tactics. A large force could bunch up, with some units behind other units, but the rear units could not support the front units, and would block the retreat of any front units. Ouch. There are weak zones of control, so units can't spread out either. Basically, we find each side using 1-deep lines with reserves to plug gaps. Missile units are devastating. Melee units are basically ineffective on frontal attacks, but very effective on flank attacks. Good melee tactics (in the game) seem to depend on having two or more units bunch up on one unit, one from the front and one on the flanks. The free Agincourt mini-game should give players an idea of the system.

Courtrai was badly developed; the designers/developers were so convinced the French didn't have a chance that they made sure the Flemish don't have a chance. The French can move their crossbowmen up and shoot the Flemish with impunity (from outside the ditches). The Flemish can't counterattack unless they want to lose really quickly.

P.S. 'Simple Great Battles of History' (by the same folks) plays better for the same complexity. Keeping two systems, one of which plays very well, and one of which does not, alongside each other doesn't strike me as a good idea.

RATING: 7.85
Have played the Falkirk scenario, and Wallace got decimated.  Completed in an hour, so quite fast and bloody.  Got some rules perhaps wrong, but getting the hang of it.  My tactics are not great, but just learning.  So far, so good!  Played two player Bannockburn scenario and the English (me) got whupped.  Some rules questions, but in general we had a good time of it.  Also have played Crecy, Coutrai and Agincourt.  Enjoy the game more each time.  Great history lesson for me as well.

July '17:  With the battle of Nejara, I've now done all the battles at least once, the first game I can say that about!  I really enjoy this game, but have not played many against someone that I can recall: the battles tend to be a bit lopsided, and so fare better as solo games.  Still, I learn a lot of history from the game, and love seeing the well-managed lines disintigrate into an unholy scrum.  Quite a bit less micromanagement, like in SPQR.  However, sometimes I skip the regroup and just eliminate the unit, which makes the battle quicker but no less fun.

RATING: 6
An interesting hex and counter war game that deals with 14th century combat. Rules are short and easy to learn and there is a unique continual activation system which means the game is not turn based. All combat rolls are decided with a single roll of a d10.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
No rating as I've only played the free Agincourt scenario. There's not much in the way of tactical decision making, beyond the blindingly obvious constraints of the weapons systems (don't have your longbowmen shock the enemy men-at-arms head on). Agincourt is a slaughter, even without the heavy dollop of French idiocy rules.

If you like this sort of thing, simultaneously luck dependent yet massively overdetermined by the situation, then it's probably a pretty good package. It's not *my* thing, except that I'm a sucker for pretty bits which, say what you want about it, this game has aplenty. Couldn't say I wouldn't pick up a punched copy on the cheap.

Simple yet tactical, and above all - fast medievil combat.
This is MY BattleLore!

The activation-continuation-seizure mechanic worked better than I expected, and creates some intresting quick decision-making... The scenarios (and battles of this age in general) were of a very defensive/offensive nature - but nothing says you HAVE TO stay put as the defender. I tend to try to attack as a defender also. A tactic that usually makes me lose, but makes for a more interesting game for both players...

RATING: 7
Was initially a little put off, the rules are slightly ambiguous and don't list everything that you'd expect them to. And it was a bit of a chore wading through the counters to find the right ones for the scenario (that'll teach me not to use a counter tray). And we took ages to get the game rolling. But once it was rolling, it really picked up speed. The game was really quite simple once we got into it, with lots of middle ages flavour. The battle was quick, bloody and chaotic. We went home happy.

RATING: 7
Played the Battle of Najera, myself as the hapless Spanish and Scott as the English.  The battle was of course longer than the three hours advertised, but surprisingly competative, even with the historical scenario.  The English longbowmen are a terror on the battlefield; it was supremely hard to charge home against them even with mounted knights.  There are some finicky melee drms that make figuring out a conflict a bit of a pain, much like, in a bizarre way, Illuminati and AVL.  There are absolutely NO terrain rules in the rulebook itself; they are all covered--supposedly--by the Terrain Effects Chart.  It is also very easy to get into a flanking position, even in front of masses of the enemy, and why the zero on a ten-sided die is zero instead of ten as it is in every other game I will never understand.  The worst part of the game for me were the Command rules, which I found very frustrating.  Yes, Spanish leaders of the time were pathetic, but it's truly hard to spend half the game in agony because you can't activate troops that are being destroyed by arrow fire.  Basically, it comes down to the fact that you are not being allowed to play, however historical the mechanic.  But, in spite of these flaws, we really had a great time with the game, and even the Command mechanic has an element of "push your luck", which is fun when it works.  I look forward to the next installment in the series, and I hope that the terrain and Command rules, among others, are tweaked and expanded a bit.

RATING: 7
A fun, simple game covering six medeival battles.  Good period flavor despite the abstractions.  While the six historical battles may be unbalanced, as they should be, there are rules for competitive play as well.  In addition, players can always switch sides and try to best their opponent by beating their Flight Level score.

RATING: 8.5
I really like this game, especially for solitaire. The components are crisp and clear, though thicker boards and bigger counters would have been even better, but it is simple enough yet chromey enough to give a good look & feel to the period. The historical variants are just that: historical, so clearly they are going to result in some blow-outs almost every time. Falkirk suffers from this the most, but it does work well as a simple intro to the system. However, using some of the non-historical variations improves the challenge significantly, and Poitiers in particular can be close as is if care is taken with the French. Most activation numbers are low enough that if players refrain from challenging, the activation will probably come back their way anyway - maybe upping them by one would increase the uncertainty and make challenges worth more? Good game.

It's slick, it's pretty, and it's easy. But it does suffer from one of the issues that I've come to expect (dread) with some Richard Berg games. It's really more of a study than a game. 

Of the battles simulated, Falkirk is pointless other than a solitaire exercise, Courtrai is unbalanced (hard for the French) and the significant "piece" is the ditch that won the battle for the Flemish, Bannockburn is the first to claim to be "as designed - somewhat ahistorically - ... fairly balanced" - historical is a walkover, Crecy "if you play with all the historical rules, you will find it very hard to win as the French", Poiters - difficult for the French, and Najera "using the historical setup , .. the English will win handily". 

In other words, you can push the counters to the historical conclusion for each battle or bend the special rules far enough to give the underdog a chance (66% to 33%?). 

Are you studying the stupidity of generals or playing a game?

RATING: 8
Yes, the battles are terribly unbalanced... So what, just adjust the victory conditions. Good entry-level wargame and welcome contribution to the underserved medieval wargame market.

I finally got around to playing this and it's a nice simple system. The rules could have been cleaner and a little reading between the lines is necessary but the game is very suited for solitaire play due to the activation mechanism. It reminds me of a simplified MPBS game which apparently borrows several concepts from GBOH to go full circle back to RHB again.

Warfare in the Middle Ages.  Love the Chivalry Aggression rule.  Bannockburn and Poitiers are my favorites.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
If you want ancient warfare and simplicity, this may be your mark.

Components are pretty solid.  Maps are nothing special and have the same feel as GMTs GBoH series.  Counters feature several varied troops types and looks based on nationality as well as the key factors to the game (without cluttering the counter).  Play aids are of solid stock & are easy to read and manipulate.

The rules read clearly, are short, and leave several game mechanics (mainly combat related) up to info easily located on the charts / play aids.  A bonus to this is the feel of 'game chrome' without lots of rules to remember.  Each scenario will also have some minor, specific rules, but nothing that alters the basics of the game.

Gameplay.  At first look the scenarios look as unbalanced as they were historically.  If you play by the historical rules per the scenario, the underdog of the fight does have a slight chance, but not enough to keep me replaying.  To mitigate this issue, the scenarios make room for the 'we offer the army, you supply the ideas' rules where you can act ahistorically in terms of overall battle plan (it accomplishes this by adding or removing restrictions ranging from movement, weather, mandatory charges, etc...).  Beyond that, gameplay moves quickly and keeps both sides involved once you get the feel for the activation cycle and are familiar with the 10 or so DRMs that can effect combat (both simple to grasp after reading  / fighting thru a few times).

Update (9/17/05) : after a bit of FtF play I can't help walking away with the following feeling.  This is a great solitaire game, a decent FtF game if using the optional scenario rules, and an OK game if playing FtF with the historical scenario rules.

RATING: 5.1
Typical Bergian effort, although more streamlined.  Chock full of interesting and relevant historical detail and flair; but 6 battles, all of which seem badly unbalanced.  A game for the armchair historian, rather than the armchair general.

After a few more playings, I revised my rating downward.  Scenarios/battles are too lopsided, with Poitiers being lopsided in the wrong direction.  I just don't like the mix of battles here, and they system seemed to work much better in Suleiman by ATO.

A straightforward game of knights vs infantry in late medieval times. The scenarios all looked one sided, which limited the entertainment value.

I arranged to sell it before I even finished all the scenarios.

RATING: 5
The low rating is for the following reasons:
1)	The rulebook is incomplete and missing many very important rules; playing with the original rules makes the game almost broken
2)	The rulebook is unclearly written in many sections. Many of the wordings and sentences could have been written much more clearly. 
3)	Having played first Infidel and Blood&Roses you can clearly see many of the unbalanced elements that you have in this first title of series. For example the missle fire rules are very unrealistic. The longbow men are mobile missle launchers with build-in aimbot. You will have very unrealistic situations where you can use missle fire for the way it wasn’t possible. There would have been major casualties for your own side in the result of friendly fire. 
4)	The playbalance of the scenarios hasn’t been a major concern in design decision, while I respect historical accuracy, you can’t really have too many scenarios heavily favoring the other, up to a point that the rulebook states: ”You can really lose this scenario when playing this side…” The balance of scenarios seems to be much better in Infidel and Blood&Roses.

I'll be happy to play the different scenarios of this game but out-of-the-box this game is nearly a disaster.

This is my first foray into "hardcore" wargames. To most, this is nothing. But to someone who only has really played games like Risk, TI3, Memoir '44, and Maria, this game really is heavy on the rules. 

I enjoyed my one play of it, and I would like to give it a few more tries. Or at least play a few more wargames that are a bit more complex. Not quite ready to jump headfirst into ASL, but it does give me a taste of the genre and lets me know that I may enjoy it.

Simple system that gives a pretty good simulation, although charge/counter-charge rules and continued attacks can be pretty involved.

RATING: 7
Simpler than more GBoH, but requires different mindset to play correctly after mentioned series. No ZOCs can lead to savage manoeuvers with infantry, on condition that there are gaps in your line!

Still, sheer accessability and overall simplicity of the design (mind you, after GBoH Men of Iron looks almost like holidays) makes it a quite fun game to play. Rules are maybe not the most clear but people with common sense and online support should have not any problems.

I have some ideas about toying with available counters to create my own piece of European medieval action. Possible, but seems like I`m waiting for Infidel. Then - Spanish reconquista becomes much more closer to fruition! :D

RATING: 3
Little room for maneuver and blow-out battles make this one a miss. I still long to see the English longbow raining arrows down, but in a more well-contested confrontation. How about battles of the Wars of the Roses?

Poitiers was a blowout with the English suffering no losses, although there were a couple of opportunities for French breakthroughs. 

With other systems I often wish there were simple versions. This one, I think, could use some more advanced rules. Lack of ZOCs can allow for some gamey tactics, for one. I like the standards, but wish the troops did not just "appear" there for rallying.

I wanted to like this.  The basic engine works as well as any other playable medieval battles game, and better than many.  Unfortunately, the rules are spotty, incomplete, and make far too many assumptions that the players will know what you are talking about.  For instance - there are no rules for terrain in the basic book, only in the playbook for each scenario - but the terrain rules for the scenario we played didn't specify how elevation worked, and the only mention of streams and bridges was on the play aid chart.  Another problem is lack of ZOCs and weird hexgrid anomalies lead to relatively easy flanking of segments of nearly any line - admittedly this flaw is shared by nearly every battle game that thinks hexes are better than squares for pre-gunpowder warfare.  The final nail, Men of Iron also suffers from every battle being a bit of a dull strategic situation, with one side favored heavily when playing the historical version.  With better scenarios, and a much tighter and more complete rulebook, I would give this another try.

The Bad
-The rulebook could have been better detailed and done. I say this since I didn't see where it tells a played to move the Flight Point marker down when units are rallied from being retired. There should been a column on the terrain charts for charging MMA (where not permitted, modifiers).
- Long sorting & set up time.
- The scenarios were historical but unbalanced but this may not be able to be a criticism if you are designing a game on this subject. Why bother putting Falkirk in?
- Small counters wish they were 5/8" all like Agincourt.

Played several games of the free Agincourt scenario, got the full game after lengthy hem-hawing on April 28, 07. Disappointed with the small counters, especially given the amount of detail on them: they're too busy looking to be half-inch and are hard to read.
The maps are pretty standard GMT quality; already have the living rules so haven't looked at the set included in the box, which I figure are the original version.
One of the player aid cards is rather dark and hard to read from a distance.
The positives for me on Men of Iron is the faster game play (less than an evening to play out a battle), two Scottish battles to fight - with axes! - and the ability to play solo.
The game has a nice ebb-and-flow feel which matches up with my thoughts on how battles probably took shape back in the day.

Update: Sold it, don't miss it. YMMV

This is my first foray into hex-and-counter warfare since I was a little kid playing my dad's old Avalon Hill games with him.  Most of my battles have been fought on my own, but I can vouch for the fact that it plays pretty well as a solitaire game.  (The main problem is, of course, that your opponent seems to predict your moves with unerring accuracy!)  There are several scenarios spanning almost a full century of history and employing the armies of several different nations, but in order to keep all this in a small box and at an affordable cost, they have had to sacrifice some quality.  Thus, the counters are small and difficult to read for my less-than-perfect eye-sight, and the battle maps are simply folded paper.  Also, I found myself constantly referring to the less-than-complete yet somewhat humorously written rule book during play, but my corresponding high complexity rating is likely more a reflection on the fact that I am a neophite to the whole war game genre than to the fact that it is a terribly difficult game, which I'm sure it isn't.  Scenarios DON'T play in an hour - even if I wasn't referring to the rule book so often they would still take at least a couple of hours to play through.  And I really wish they had included the Agincourt scenario in the original game.  All in all, it's fun to re-create these pivotal battles of history, and the game does start to flow pretty well once you get the hang of it, but I've discovered that the old hex-and-counter thing really isn't for me (although "Conquest of Heroes" just might revitalize my interest...).  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 1.5/5  Total: 5/10

High rating more for the system than the scenarios in this game due to some of them being fairly unbalanced.Simple mechanics which succede in capturing the tactics and feel of medieval battles without cumbersome rules. More streamlined than GBOH with enough detail to keep you coming back. The random activation works well for solitaire play and makes every action important. Plus gaming time is kept to a few hours for those of us whose real lives prevent us from blocking off a whole weekend to gaming. Prefer Infidel to Men of Iron but this is a must have game for anyone interested in medieval or ancient warfare.

Not too happy with the Charge mechanic (development of the game slipped at the last moment). Hopefully Infidel will smooth things out.

Well-executed game that plays as well as a solitaire title as it does with an opponent across the table.  Battles are very typically one sided with traditional medieval knights fighting an uphill battle against well positioned infantry defenders.  This isn't a flaw in the game...this was a reality of the period that is demonstrated quite well.

Rating is based upon playing the agincourt module solo only.

I like the system in general, and especially the leader activation mechanics. On the other hand I did play this game solo only, and I think that, depending on the scenario it might be a bit dull for the second player...

Enjoyed this relatively easy wargame on a medieval subject. I thought the activation system was clever and added to the decision making. Counters are nice as was the map we used.(Bannockburn) But make sure players agree on what rules to use (for example MOI living rules or latest printed set such as Arquebus). Hoping they release the first 3 volumes in a tri-pack.

A comment from Jon Compton above offers a perfect summary of what I feel about this game : "It is clear that the designer does not understand that averages only work in large populations, not in limited quantities." The continuity die roll is so important in this game that it becomes completely ridiculous. I had the same feeling about the Glory system from the same designer in which I wasn't able to activate a commander for the whole game.

Besides, the fact that there are no turn makes for strange situations : in Courtrai for example, there is no incentive for the French to attack and he may try to kill the flemish infantry with his crossbowmen (very long but possible)...

It may be a fun game for solitaire players but it is not really fun otherwise.

A unique turn/initiative system, with simple mechanics makes this a great fast playing game (with few information markers!!! - yay!)

Still looking for Infidel, toughest of the first two to find IMHO.  This is a nice copy un-punched, short rules(for a Berg game), looks very playable.

This rating is based on a reading of the rules, the group has yet to play it.  Interesting mechanics in that initiative flows based upon the quality of leaders; there are no set turns.  This command and control system and the interesting battles lead me to believe this will be a good game.

Nothing really innovative here. It does an adequate job, but suffers from unbalanced battles.

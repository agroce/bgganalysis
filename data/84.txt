Bought it on an auction (almost new) as I generally love Columbia's block games. But I just didn't get the rules to this game nor the feel of it (honestly, I'm not a WW2 desert war fan though I typically like mech). Sold it.

FAST and FURIOUS. Probably the best game I have played of the Desert War.

As in reality, the supply constraints are unforgiving.

The individual scenarios can vary greatly in duration: From 2 to 5 hours.

Picking Columbia's best block game is like picking your favorite child.  But if you are going to try, this is as good as any to start with.

The way Rommel's leadership is baked into the units (double defense) and movement, as well as the way supply is handled is brilliant.  The rules are easy but the tactics are deep.
  
This was released over 30 years ago and it still schools many of the youngsters.

Columbia's three best games are Julius Caesar, Rommel in the Desert, and Eastfront.

RATING: 7
Great intense game. The blocks creates the necessary FOW thus adding a level of uncertainty to battles. 

To choose the commitment level in a battle is great, proving flexibility as well as need. 

However, I do end up with a few empty depot cards that I'm not sure what to do with them besides using them to bluff. 

Must try a few mire times to get a good feel of it's strategy.

RATING: 8.5
One of the best of the block games. The supply cards and the fog of war offered by the blocks make this a really tense game to play. When to commit, when to hold and when to run away depend on what you know about the enemy and what cards you are holding. Really a great game with lots of tough, tough choices but still a low unit density so you can fit a game into an afternoon pretty easily.

This is one of the older of Columbia's games so it doesn't have the nice 10 or so pages of rules. The rules run a good 19 pages although they are not too dense. There are also 6 pages of scenarios complete with some nice historical commentary. There is a good sample game that you can follow along with to help learn the rules. And unlike a lot of the games from Columbia this one offers several pages of strategy and design notes which is always nice. 

Current rules version - 1.02

The best block game and an excellent North Africa Game--clean, logical game system.  You must be careful of the supply status of units and the potential for the cutoff of supply.

RATING: 8
Tense and nailbaiting game that requires steel nerves now and then ... and a bit of luck occasionally. Mistakes can be unforgiven, so play with care. 

RitD captures the flavour of the desert warfare in North Africa very well. Supply problems, daring back and forth armour manoeuvres, unit quality, minefields, the siege of Tobruk, a smooth combat system and Rommel himself. They are all included! 

However I do question the victory conditions which are the same for every scenario, whether the historical counterparts are on the run or in the winning mood. That is not real! Besides the British come with far too many units. Especially in 1942 this runs way out of proportion. Historical correct, but not in game terms! 

One other point of criticism concerns Columbias re-release of this game. They could have modernized RitD. Some game mechanics are too complicated. The block games have evolved a lot since 1984 with usually smaller rule books. They didn't do it and I can live with that. More unforgiving is that they didn't put more unit information on the blocks, such as speed. And nicer pictograms instead of the Nato symbols would also have looked much better.

RATING: 7.5
This wargame is a very solid combat-maneuver-logistics game depicting a campaign where these things were equally important.

However, as someone stated in a forum, if you and your opponent are newbies, you will tend to pile up blocks in 1 or 2 hexes and try to win massive battles by sheer numbers. And that will give you a wrong impression that this game is not a good representation of the mobile war that one expects from a North Africa WW2 game.

The trick here, that I've learned from a more experienced gamer is:  if your opponent starts piling up defenses in one hex, send troops there just to make him commit even more troops and then send your more mobile and strong armor behind his lines to cut his supply and make everything collapse.

The first time one of you pulls it off, the possibilities of this beautiful design will reveal themselves to you and the experience will reach a whole different level. That happened to us in our third match and now we are in love with RitD.

Also:  I STRONGLY recommend printing out the map posted here by user zogthedoomed. It is large, beautiful, a work of art (!), and it will enhance your experience twofold.

5/2017: I've played the '41 and '42 scenarios.  They require an aggressive German. There's a lot about balance in this game, and you can lose in ways that you didn't foresee as your troops are cut off and eliminated.
 
The supply mechanic adds a lot of uncertainty. Rommel is clear predecessor to Eastfront.  A lot of the core mechanics were ported over for that game.  The designer has really done a lot to advance the state of wargaming with these block games.  

Sleeved in FFG sleeves.

2006: Rating based upon one play.  A very good wargame that can be played relatively quickly.  I like the suspense created by the fog of war and the emphasis on manuever rather than blunt force blows.  Heavy in theme, but a game that can be played in 2-3 hours.  I find myself replaying the game in my mind, and that's always a good sign for me.  Looking forward to future plays.

Would be about perfect if not for the poorly written rules and lack of charts all in one place.  With all the errata out there now though this has been addressed so I guess it is a perfect game if you include that.

RATING: 7
UPDATE: Well, after a few plays of the full game, I remain impressed with this game, despite the fact that I'm still learning the nuances of successful play. 

One frustrating aspect of the game for me so far, is that it seems one mistake can have catastrophic (and game ending) consequences. Realizing this can cause both players to become much more timid and conservative in their play, and really put a damper on the type of wide open flanking moves seen in the historical campaign. Of course, this is likely not a problem with the game, but rather my own play. 

-----
Just one play of the 1940 scenario so far, and it was quite fun. Looking forward to giving the campaign game a go.

I'm a long time wargamer, but this was my first block game ever, and I'm pretty impressed.

In addition to the uniqueness of the block mechanic, the game also introduced many other new mechanics that I had not seen before, particularly the entire battle mechanism. It took a little time for the rules to sink in, but I'm pretty sure we've got it down now.

I'm very confident my rating for this will only rise as I play it more.

Initial Impression: There's alot to like in this classic game. The components are nice. The rules are simple. And the decisions are very difficult. A cut supply line can mean the end of the battle for you. As a result, the ongoing tug-of-war for territory is tempered with the need to protect your supply lines. I love how this game flows, how reinforcements are introduced, and how supply cards can be used to bluff your opponent. Given the opportunity, I would add this game to my collection in a heartbeat.

Extremely fascinating game of logistics and tactical movement that I would play more often if not for its complexity and length.  Forget pretenders like Bonaparte at Marengo and its ilk of wargames appealing to Euro tastes and just go for the best and Rommel in the Desert is the best.  Nary an ounce of fat can be found on this masterpiece and its inherent excellence should be apparent even to the refined tastes of a gamer weened on the delicacies of Germany.

RATING: 6
After one play. A fascinating problem of bluff, supply, and maneuver for two players, Rommel' covers the war in the North Africa up to the end of 1942. It contains all the elements of a great block game: an emphasis on implied intent and maneuver as the primary tools for defeating an opponent and attention to the problems of supply and rebuild/refit. These are elements that often create blinding complexity in traditional hex-and-counter games, but are deftly handled in this pioneering  effort from 1984. Play times are manageable and the game itself pretty intense for two players. As my opponent said, most games seem to hinge on breaking the other player's will to continue the game as the result of completing a deft encirclement or seizing upon a blunder.

I haven't played it in almost 15 years, but better late than never in leaving feedback.

The Supply system seems neat, but its completely unrealistic.  Its absurd to think you can extend your units away from supply lines by creating a chain of units.  Sorry, real life doesn't work that way.  Its not like the soldiers all become porters, allowing mechanized units to draw supply through them.  Imagine 12,000 men carrying oil, gas, and ammo through the desert, off road.

The combat system is harsh on the player who decides to break off combat, and probably uunrealistic.  If things start to go badly and you withdraw, the similar speed enemy units gets to shoot at you.  The loser can be crushed.

The fog of war is neat.
Maybe if this was redone with a more modern system, it would be better.

I guess its better than Bobby Lee, but I will never play it again.

This is a really clever block game, where supply is key. The coast road is very important for supply and tracks leading north-south into the desert can leave things vulnerable. Get cut off and end up out of supply and blocks can be eliminated immediately, where nowmally it's a 6 to hit for a 1 step loss. Good combined arms feel where tanks fight tanks if possible, and infantry v infantry if possible, so you need tanks to stop your infantry being hit by tanks at double strength attacks and you need infantry to stop your tanks being swarmed by infantry at normal strength attacks. Good stuff!

I love this game.

This is a somewhat simple game once you have played it.  The first time though it might take you a bit longer in order to work out all the delicate nuances to perfect game play.

The game empahsises supply networks in 2 ways.  Firstly, connections and road with units branching out from those raods,tracks,trails.  Secondly overall supply momentum in reflected by a game tool called a supply card.  These cards have a certain chance to have "supply' on them.  When you are given the chance for initiative by playing these cards you dictate one of 4 options.  If you don't have at least one your only option will be to pass. (maybe withdraw which is a kind of pass allowing you to collapse your supply network).  

For me the real game hasn't been in so much how I have moved into and out of supply but how to break the enemy or rout them to break their supply or to know actually how to gain true card momentum.

I've played one two-player game with the short scenario (Italians vs. Allies). I was the Allies, and I let myself get too embroiled in the fight by Bardia when the Axis reinforcements arrived. I was well ahead on supply, but I was greatly outgunned and, considering the scenario, all but done for. But then I remembered the other victory conditions: take the enemy base, and the game is over. I zoomed my little recon unit out by the oases. Foolishly and needlessly, I force marched and failed the roll, leaving my poor recon guys disrupted in the desert. But I still had enough supply to send a second, slightly-slower unit, to take the base.

Here's my point. If the smallest scenario in the game, with the lamest outcome imaginable, is able to provide such a narrative, what does that say about the game's potential? I look forward to playing more of Rommel in the Desert.

RATING: 8
Rating based on one play of the Crusader scenario at BGG.CON '08 (playing the Axis against Kuhrusty's Allies).  Really enjoyed this game, and not only because I managed to inflict heavy casualties early.  One concern, though, is that the win may go to the player who gets a better ratio of supply cards -- only subsequent plays will tell.

Not quite how I remembered block games.

Too much of a thinking/puzzle game for my taste,
and probably too unforgiving, but this is more than
just mounting an AH 'classic' on wooden blocks for FoW.

On the other hand, this seems less a wargame than Afrika Korps (which is about my lower limit). I see the appeal,
but it's just not enough for me.

It is not about battles but more about protecting your supply lines while trying to cut the enemy's supply line.

After three short scenarios, we are still feeling our way around this one, but I am in awe of the beauty of the longer scenarios that loom ahead. While considerably more rules intensive than any of the other Columbia block games I've played, it is well worth it; the unit differences, the long-term commitment that is an engagement, the difficulty of disengaging, the delectably tough trade offs between the group and regroup moves, and, of course the supply... O! The supply. In both it's forms - cards and supply lines - the supply is so wonderfully implemented. No, it is not realistic, but it's effect is a marvelous abstraction. This game starts with a 9 with room to move up once the campaigns begin. It is everything I look forin a wargame: few moving parts, low reliance on luck, big bluff factor, big maneuver component, and evocative mechanisms.

What a pleasure to play. Positional play and supply battles are far more important than actual combat. This feels more like what I imagine military leaders fretting over. This game does not feel dated at all (from 1984) in comparison with more modern wargames I've played. This is my favorite block game I've played so far...although my copy of Europe Engulfed has not yet hit the table.

Its important to understand the value of keeping enemy units engaged, even in a sacrificial battle for you, to allow opportunity for threatening supply lines and cutting off units. The supply line cards can be annoying if they are dealt in a lop-sided distribution, but the bluffing and hand-management afforded to both players usually make up for small inconsistencies.

Columbia Games.  Rommel in the Desert is a very solid, double blind, block war game.  The system is very clean and the game portrays Rommel's advance against Bengazi, Tobruk and hopefully, finally, El Alamein/Suez rather well.  The double blind aspect of the game keeps players guessing where the real attack may come from and what is a feint.  The supply dynamics are realistic and are reasonably easy to follow.  You also get to roll lots of dice in this game as there is lots of combat most every turn.  Rommel in the Desert is also fun to play and was the game that started me playing double blind block games.  If you are a fan of the desert war - this game belongs in your game collection! Rommel in the Desert is in my top 30 of best war games.

Great game.  Surprising depth given the rather simplistic treatment of North Africa with blocks, supply cards (4 different action possibilities) and limited number of hexes to maneuver.

Supply is key - protect your supply line(s) or risk getting cut off with devastating consequences.  A must for fans of block games and/or North Africa aficionados.

Rating after a couple plays. Very interesting block game with some unique supply and initiative mechanics, and a small amount of book keeping.

The overall effect is a game that provides interesting situations and challenges, while creating replayability both in the form of different scenarios and variations in the card draws.

Quick and fun hex&block game. Requires some careful thought since simple mistakes can create great disasters. Captures the low density, highly mobile aspect of the african campaign beautifully. Also has an early CDG aspect via the supply cards. Rules are a very hard read though.

Interesting game but not as good as the other block games I've tried. It's too much about supply and movement to cut off supply for me as I prefer more direct games with more battles. The cards can be a downer as well, in a recent game as the Germans I drew 6 dummies in a row, fun?

Complexity falls between Hammer of the Scots and East Front.Three things drive this game: (1) Supply, (2) Supply, and (3) Supply  (Sorry for stealing and morphing the old real estate saying).This game is just a little too complex for my current tastes and ability to invest time into a game.

It's not about attacking 2 units with 10, and rolling the dice to kill off the outnumbered opposition. It's about maneuvering, getting to places first to establish a longer supply line, and hoping to cut off your opponent's supply.

Finally tried with son. Seems pretty fiddly for a low density block game. First play was disappointing for a game so praised with difficult setup (counters have no indication of which scenario they are used for and where to start them), as well as poorly written rules:
- section 16.0 says one can spend BP to purchase extra supply cards, and actually cost is explained nowhere (except bottom of last page)
- refuse/retreat/withdrawal: 3 separate terms describing the same action, this is a no-no in the land of reader-friendliness
- hidden blocks, and never says when units have to be revealed... (oops 7.3)

Skeptical regarding the need for dummy cards: only used for bluffing, which is rare.
And a  lot of turtling on the coastal highway (seems realistic but not much fun)...rest of the map seems useless.

Anyway will try again.

RATING: 7
After 8 plays my views have shifted a little. I still think this is a good competitive game but it does not give me historical immersion. You have to read out the supply lines. This itself is fine but in practice, to be competant at this game each turn you must read out all your, and all your opponents possible supply routes, only then can you read two turns a head to work out where you need to be and where you need your opponent not to be. This coupled with the rather harsh disruption of all units that leave a battle results in a very Go like game. I like Go but i am forgiven the occasional mistake in Go. In my 8 games of Rommel one mistake decided every game. Unless there is a deeper level of mastery to the supply cards element of the game I cannot see how you would make a campaign last 2 years. Most games result in one major battle and one supply cut leading to near total destruction for one side.
--------------------
The best iteration of the block system that i've seen. This is a game where you really must find the weak point in your opponents concealed blocks and strike through. Its a game of manoeuvre and cutting your opponents supply lines. Its more intuitive than Napoleons Triumph and only slightly more complex than the other columbia games. It is however very punishing of even the slightest mistake, and to the novice mistakes come often. 

Also it has a tonne more scenarios than most block games, and being a WW2 war game, does cover the interactions between different unit types in an interesting way.

Simple, quick, fun, and not a bad simulation for the amount of time spent learning and playing it.  Very interesting to watch the ebb and flow of action because there are months where both players chose to be inactive in order to rebuild, and this is accomplished elegantly without intrusive iron-maiden rules forcing players to hibernate.  Very dynamic: defense, without the threat (or reality) of an effective counter-attack, is sterile and generally doomed.

A very streamlined wargame design unencumbered with unecessary complexity that does a very good job of capturing the feel of the North African campaign. Really zeroes in on the critical factors of the campaign, which is supply and more supply. The challenge for the Afrika Korps is duly borne out in this game. The only downside is the rulebook. While the rules are not complex, the rulebook does a poor job of surfacing the really critical rules! Also needs a better player aid (no reference to unit movement and terrain modifiers!) But these are minor obstacles to experienced wargamers and in no way detract from the brilliance of the game design.

I've played this game once, and I played the three-turn Crusader scenario. I feel like there's too much going on to give it a fair review, so I'm just going to say I dig it. I like the brutal supply, I like the psychological elements, I like the big, sprawling battles. I like the brutal little map, and the blocks, and the simple but effective CRT. I want to play more. I want to play longer scenarios. I want to play short scenarios again. I want to understand what's going on and how to win and why I lose and what it takes to defend Tobruk. I have a strong feeling that this game will become a favorite.

RATING: 9
The combination of brutal supply rules and no ZOC makes this game a exercise in surprise, movement, cutting off units and piece placement.  It's critical how your units relate to one another in terms of their spacing on the gameboard and along supply lines. These elements give the game a slightly abstract, spatial feel but the small number of blocks and the sense of history in the game keep it grounded firmly in WWII. The card management side of the game is fun and exciting and makes each game a guessing game with some serious fog of war.  Add to this the variety of scenarios and you really have a fine game.  I think you need to play it with someone who is willing to play a learning game or two and really invest in exploring the system.  I think it's harder for new players to warm to than Hammer of the Scots, for example.  I love block games and this is one of the best. It's a game you can really dig into and develop skills at, which is attractive.

My initial expression after first few tries: I think I will be liking EastFront more but RitD is a fine game indeed. Luck and bluffing seems to play a bigger role than in EastFront, but it not too much. There are plenty of novel mechanics, I especially like how it is able to fighting withdrawal versus the dangers of getting pinned down.

I appreciate the system and how well the simulation works.  The "sudden death" aspect of a single mistake irredeemably bringing someone's game to a crashing halt due to cut-off supply -- though realistic, I'm sure -- puts me off quite a bit.

This game has really grown on me.  Though the rules are a bit ponderous in parts, the game play is rather smooth in practice. The block induced fog-of-war really works here. A quick flanking manuever or even the threat of one make for some interesting decisions.  Defending and attacking supply lines is the name of the game.

A friend of mine took the map to Kinkos and had them photo-copy and printed at least double sized. It's huge now but we can fight almost all battles in the battle-hex.

This is a quality game and a good simulation. I found the rules very easy to read and understand, with those for supply and disruption adding excellent touches. The actual game involves a lot of bluffing, supply management, and the proper use of combined arms. My only grip is that the large hexes negate grand maneuvering and it can be easy for either side to set up a strong defensive position. Fortunately the victory conditions encourage offensive action.

Rommel in the Desert is one of the best games for teaching the value of a reserve (both supply and reinforcements). Many wargames are absolutely terrible at this and so it's common to push your units as fast and as hard as you can each and every turn. Approach Rommel in the Desert with this mindset and you'll quickly realize why that doesn't happen in real-life.

Good WWII Desert - Operational - Medium 

Plus:
-Fantastic supply rules 
-Hard to master; many attack / move options, many unit types, loads of uncertainites due to bluffing 
-Great replay value due to the scenario's
-Many different unit types, almost gives it a tactical feel
-Many different move / attack options
-One of the best wargame designs ever 

Minus:
-Sorry, horrible and unevocatove components
-This is not for the faint of heart and don't expect to dive in and play. Many gamers are confused with the many options and many units the game offers. -Un-evocative The gameboard is unappealing (okay it's desert)and a nice mounted should have made a great difference.
-I faced severe problems getting the German stickers of the sheet and many are damaged.
-Minor quirck: why did they red blocks for the British units? All the Front Series the Allies have blue blocks. 
Well, red or blue, still ugly unfortunately.

So finally I got this one and mind you this is a more complicated block game than might appear.

Reason I got this one late as I am not particularly fond of desert warfare in the first place. Looking at the pictures it did not appeal to me and I thought ot was just another Front Series type of game, set in the desert.

This is a great wargames thanks to it's intriguing system; a lot of seduction and surprise and I have not interest in playing any other game on the dessert war, yet this is not for the faint of heart.

I did not play this the last 2 years, got a good offer.

An excellent simulation of desert warfare. It's a game for Grognards as there are some complex move mechanics and brutal supply rules.

This is a very slick design and provides a tight, playable, competitive contest.  I like this game immensely and feel it does a very good job of evoking the nature of the war in North Africa in terms of the challenges faced by the opposing commanders (and based on 30 years of reading about this theatre as my grandfather was bagged by Rommel when Tobruk fell in 1942!).  My comments are based on the original version which I bought when it first came out, I have not seen the current version.  Take the "2" rating below with a very large grain of salt.

The rulebook is really terrible!
But the game is really good!

Best if you know someone who's familiar with the game already, otherwise you'll be spending a lot of time going through that rulebook. (especially the wording about the withdrawal move in conjunction with the supply network can be very misleading)

Now for the game: It is about SUPPLY, bold moves, bluffing & very strategic decisions. Every mechanic & every rule intertwines perfectly. Nothing is superflous, nothing is missing. That's why this game is so highly regarded after all these decades.

Fights are just a side-show in this game, superior supply is what will bring victory. And this struggle for supremacy is gritty! You'll be wanting to exploit every way of hitting your opponent, wether through stalling his advance, slashing deep behind his lines, bluff about supply cards, lay mine ambushes or simply threaten with units in the rear.
I'm seing myself playing this a lot!

For me the Desert War is the most interesting of WWII's campaigns and this is among the best strategic level recreations of it to date. It's really essential to play one of the whole year campaigns, the short scenarios are fine for learning the system, but don't give supply cards, build points and reinforcements enough emphasis. The only problem I can forsee is that the 1941 and 1942 campaigns are identical except for the units taking part and, in all campaigns, possession of Tobruk is the prime victory determinant. After a couple of plays this went on the trade pile, I don't have time for the longer campaigns and single battles are too tough for the Allies to win against the resilient German panzers.

Wooden-block game that appears to be inspired by Jedko's African Campaign.  A number of curiosities from that game, such as Fortress Benghazi and inelegant minefield rules that don't work right, made their way into this design.  This game's best feature is its supply rules.  Players receive a number of supply cards which they can use to attack or advance.  Falling back on one's supply lines does not require a card, which is a very nice way of reflecting the advantage of a shortened supply line.  This is one of the most elegant and realistic features that Iâve ever seen in a wargame.  Unfortunately, I'm not convinced by the rest of the design.  Due to tight hexside limits and the defender firing first, the defender has a significant advantage in combat that I'm not sure matches the historical experience of this campaign.  In particular, I'm not sure what the hexside limits are modeling, since the units represent anything from battalions to divisions.  The biggest problem with the game is that it is too difficult to extricate one's units from combat.  The errata introduce a rule that allows for a safe withdrawal of most (but not all) of one's units from a disadvantaged battle at the end of the month, but there remains no mechanism to retreat safely during the turn.  The result is a very chess-like experience where players attempt to cut off each other's supply lines and avoid any potentially disadvantaged combats, and where any mistake can prove fatal.  This game is revered by wargamers who like chess-like contests, but I'd rather play the situation than the system.  Also, it should be pointed out that the one-size-fits-all victory conditions don't work for all scenarios, as the burden of the attack is often on the wrong player.

I've only played one game, but I'll be able to tell with another outing whether or not the system is for me.  As it stands, the game is way too fiddly and combat is much less satisfying than I would like.  I know the emphasis of Rommel is supposed to be on the supply line mechanics, which are pretty nifty, but as a whole the game is too dry for the war theme.  -And what's up with the two pages of rules and explanations for the most ill-concieved implementation of bluffing ever seen?  This is probably the first block game I haven't immediately liked.

After plays of Battleaxe, Crusader, Gazala, 1940 and 1941 scenarios. Rommel is, without doubt, among the top tier of Columbia block games. Yet again it surprises me how deep a gaming experience can be constructed from a simple and clear map, a bunch of blocks and a modestly complex rule set. Despite being twice the length of the Hammer of the Scots or Crusader Rex rulesets, the Rommel rules are still very manageable, although a player aid would be an asset. One aspect in which Rommel scores above more recent Columbia stablemates is in the large number of scenarios. The only concern I have is that an unlucky hand of supply cards can make it difficult for the Axis player to conduct offensives, resulting in a more static game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
What a great game. Love the whole supply effect, I donât know the war really well myself but Iâll bet it mimics the struggle of true supply in the desert well.  Supply is part of every decision you make which really gives the game a unique feel, itâs largely a make you or break you aspect in the game and is more important than many of the battles.  One of the other great things here is the bluffing aspect and how it effects the game with the initial vie for turn order to move-combat combos and not knowing can make the reaction decisions tough.  

Aside of those things you have the typical fog of war block game aspects and dice for combat resolution rules you find in other games with tanks vs infantry etc, but the aspects mentioned really make it stand out from the pack.  Bad card draw can really hurt, bad rolls at bad times too, cards can be mitigated a little but overall yeah luck can sting you good (hmmm maybe a houserule or two) The game plays smooth mostly overall and was good fun.

I've only played this once, but I found the game to be a very nice system.  This game is all about supply, as has been noted everywhere.  The tactical dance of positioning is crucial in this title.  Couple that with supply issues and you have yourself one really tense game.  It is NOT forgiving to first time players... Make a mistake and you can find your pieces dying and out of supply in a heartbeat.  The complexity overhead is a bit difficult if you're not familiar with wargames.  I think this is a very deep and rewarding system that I'll have to play a bunch more, but I can easily see my rating for this game increasing with further plays.

While a lot of other games tackle this campaign, Rommel in the Desert give players a better feel for what it must have been like to be either Rommel or Monty in North Africa.  Fog of war is crucial - as it was in the actual campaign - and the supply cards provide tremendous uncertainty and really tough choices for both players.  Not a &quot;light&quot; wargame, but not too heavy either.  A true classic.

Only Negative is that the rules are onerous, but you have got to be aware of every rule, else your army could disappear like a speck of sand in your dirty eye.
Beautiful map and Blocks, with big hexes.  Reinforcement Arrival times are not hard-wired.  Why more games don't use that feature is beyond me.

RATING: 9
Best WW2 operational wargame? Yes, in my book. Probably too complex for casual gamers (thanks to the supply/road net rules), the combination of Columbia's hidden strength block system and the fluid Western desert situation makes for a fast moving, varied and unpredictable game. Lots of scenarios from simple (but still challenging) to complex - this is one good wargame. I believe there's talk of Columbia re-publishing the game - while I've got an old 1980's copy I'm more than happy with, an updated rulebook would be welcome.

This is a rare gem that combines playbility with simulation value. The block system captures the cut and thrust nature of the conflict perfectly.

Game requires an outrageous number of dice for large scale battles and it is too hard to break contact once engaged (even the worst pursuits in the real war rarely came close to what happens in RitD).  It didn't do much for me.

RATING: 5
Despite owning several block games, this is the first one I've actually played, and it's one of the few if not the only operational-level game I've played, too. This deserves more plays with the longer scenarios, but 2x in the 1940 one is leaving me rather cold in the hot sand. Clearly this game requires some practice to see how to chain effectively for supply and avoid having nothing but rather dull pitched battles, but I'm not sure I'm up for it.

2004 edition.  Expected more.  Far too few decisions than I need to enjoy a game, and we quickly tired of the die-rolling (82 dice in one combat that remained unresolved in the Crusader scenario -- not typical of the campaign game, I trust).  Having played three different scenarios, I'm certain we are long past having the rules and mechanisms of play down pat.  Hopefully, later playings will unlock the supposed greatness of this game.  Might be an excellent game for people trying to get into wargames, as it does include, abstractedly, many mechanisms and concepts typical of more complex games.  Supporters of the game say the campaign scenarios are where it's at, so my opinion of the game will hopefully improve after we play those.  Still, dull smaller scenarios with non-scenario-specific victory conditions is not an encouraging sign of greatness.

I used to rate this game higher. I now find the rules a bit too convoluted because they have to try to solve the problem of in hex combat. It feels like half of the rules in the game are trying to make the in hex all work and it just feels overwrought. Withdrawal from a hex is just too deadly. Also the eliminate all units out of supply at months start can lead to some gamey strategies and is far too lethal. Sure you should always have secure supply lines, but the games mechanics and lack of supply make it very slow to actually move the multiple groups needed for securing those lines let alone have combat.

Good game, critical to understand supply rules, though. After four plays, better understanding strategy and style, but still can be frustrating if you're used to less demanding supply structures. One of these days I will win.

This is currently my favorite 2-player game.  I love how you can wipe out enemy units just by out-maneuvering them, and how one slip can end the game.  I only wish it were easier for new players to pick up.

Update: although I love this game, I haven't played it in a while; lately it's been EastFront II.

Update: and then WestFront II... and now I'm on a CC:E and Napoleon's Triumph kick... but I'm still calling this a 10, because it's awesome.

RATING: 8.5
Anyone complaining about Rommel being too much chess because of the low unit count, I hear ya. But somehow I love it exactly because of that; maneuvering is key, supply is KEY, engaging in battle is risky (especially for the Allies), and a sudden death always lurks around the corner if you make a mistake at the wrong moment. Short-term randomness can hose you, so the longer scenarios are definitely the way to go. There are things in EastFront that I like better, but Rommel is quicker and thus easier to get on the table.

RATING: 5
Perhaps I was expecting too much - I love the Desert Campaign, Rommel, Crusaders and such, plus RitD is so highly respected here on the Geek. But for me, this game was a disappointment. The obvious lack of hexes makes maneuver difficult, (as do the supply rules), and inevitably leads to smash-mouth, brute force combats. And the dice-fests of major engagements didn't thrill me either. The rules regarding withdrawals are really fiddly too. I did like the supply rules, though. Maybe I've played too many North Afrika games and have grown fond of the cut-and-thrust, unit differentiations, and terrain.    
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This rating might need to be revised in the near future as my first game was marred by a misunderstanding of the manner of combat resolution that made double step units much more difficult to destroy than intended.  The struggle to maintain supply lines makes RiD quite unique among the block games.  The game should include markers to denote disruption of units.

New edition has a stunning box cover and map.  Worth a look at this block game classic.  It may not be a treat for the wargamer though.  Because to reslove a single battle, you may have to roll 40 to 70 dice...!  I am not sure I would buy this game. Everything seems to be not in a proportion to me.  Perhaps it is because of the blocks and the need to stick the paper on the counters yourselve....

A block wargame (fog-of-war, a lot of dice rolling to resolve combat, etc.). Not so "friendly" to casual wargamers as other titles (from the simple Quebec 1759 to the medium Hammer of the Scots).
Possibly featuring the worst rulebook I've ever read.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This would be a brilliant game... if only the withdrawal rules were not so unforgiving.  Together with the fact that a long supply line does not affect you, it is very unlikely to get the historical seesaw campaign.  The side that wins the first major victory will gain a massive advantage. Have not played the latest version, but the rules in the previous version were terrible, with lots of serious errata.

Only 2 games played so far, but this game appears to be just as good as so many have reported. This game is all about making sure your own supply network doesn't get cut and instead trying to get your enemy's units unsupplied. The game is unforgiving of mistakes - one mistake and soon your whole army can be unsupplied and the game is pretty much over.

More to follow when I'll get more playing experience...

2 / 5 - Fair.

An odd, but interesting game which seems to be focused on maneuver and bluff to the exclusion of almost everything else - actual combat is an aside compared with the threat of combat. This is partly done through the blunt instrument of a slightly silly combat mechanic which encourages maneuver instead of assault but which can have daft results (battles going on for months) when you do end up fighting. The result can be dry and sometimes hard work, but it is often also excruciatingly tense. It's also marginally more complex than I'd usually pick - I'm astonished that it's frequently cited as a "beginner" wargame, because it's not - but it's a bit more intuitive than a quick scan of the rules would suggest.

One of the best games in my collection.  Edgy.  One of the best rulebooks ever published by Columbia Games.  It's not eight pages and full of gaps.

It's a really small detail but I had a devil of a time looking up the info on the net.

RATING: 9
Incredibly exciting and tense game. The double FoW - you can't see the opponent's units nor do you know what supply he has left - is simply superb. It's quite complicated (for a block game). Supply is all-important, which means that it can be unforgiving. But an absolute blast to play.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is one of the best wargames I own, although I would rate Eastfront better (on the down side, Eastfront takes longer to play, and it's more complicated). I have seen some take issue with this game's 'realism'. I would submit that the most important factors in the desert war were supply, deception, bluff and the stifling fog of war. (represented here not just by the hidden blocks, but the ingenious supply cards) RitD models these brilliantly. Other designers have expended a lot of effort determining that 21st Pz is a 10-8-21, and the 7th Armoured is a 8-7-24, or whatever,  while giving only scant attention to FOW. Both avenues have merit, but RitD is a good game because it's easy to play, and tense. As a bonus to this, it gives the player a lot of insight into important factors which heavily affected the campaign.

Note: this really isn't that difficult a game to play, but reading the rules of this one made my eyes glaze over like few others. It would be a lot easier to have someone show you the game.

Also, stay away from the 1940 scenario, aside from doing it once maybe to learn some of the mechanics. It doesn't do much to show the game off, and is a boring affair, mostly meant to show how easily motorized units can avoid combat from slower units, I imagine. The '41 scenario and the campaigns are real crackers.

Played twice with Geek Buddy DrFlanagan. Good game, hard to get a handle on the proper tactics at first due to unusual mechanics (at least compared to what I'm accustomed to). But it made a favorable first impression and I will be much interested in playing enough to feel competent at it.

I've played seven times now (five losses, one "had to quit due to time but most likely would have lost" and one win by cutting off supply to all the opponent's units). I liked every game. It's a good system. The supply rules are brutal. It's got a good mix of skill and luck.

Tactically, you have to choose your battles carefully, because you pay a heavy penalty for getting in over your head and/or retreating.

Strategically, you have to choose your battles carefully, because if you get bogged down your entire position can be ruined and your opponent may have an opening.

The flanking maneuver is an obvious tactic--but it had better work--because if you get a group of units bogged down (down by the oasis, say), your center will be exposed and weak, and you risk getting many units cut off and eliminated.

The Allied nightmare is having a big stack of units delayed by a small number of German units that are hard to damage because of their elite status. I should know, this happened to me and cost me a chance to win the game.

First game played on April 22, 2006.  What can I say?  One game, with residual questions about the rules still leaves me begging for more.  This is a stunning game.  I have to wonder who thought that the rule book was well written, though.  I can only assume from this game that the replay value of this game, even on the scenario level, is extremely high.  Just change the position of one block and the game is completely different.  I initially rated this a nine and will likely give it back to that rating once I'm comfortable with the rules.

I got this game in trade and with the exception of the blocks being already stickered, a task I reallllly love to do (sarcasm), the game arrived in fantastic shape, I hope my trading partner felt the same about the game he got from me. I owned the first edition of this game (red box) and found it a bit complicated, of course now that I have some years of experience under my belt, it's a totally different ball of wax and I finally realized how truly easy this game is, I do miss the old blocks though. I look forward to playing this game against an opponent soon, alas I have to solitaire it for now, but I am happy I made the trade...

This is clearly a good game, but after two plays I am still having trouble grasping the fundamental strategies, particularly getting my head around the supply situation.

Two player block wargame recreating the 1940 North Africa campaign. Each player controls tanks, artillery and infantry, which they must keep in supply.

The nail biting tension of this game is even better than Eastfront, because the supply is tighter and front is narrower.

(20.12.2007: Just to remind myself about buying more heavy(?) wargames soon: Took 6 hours to read rules twice through with a though but now I have feeling I know most of the rules correctly.) This is about as rules heavy game as I like to play. More exceptions and/or additional rules and it would start to lower my interest in a game.

24.7.2008: Finally got to play this one! We played first scenario and it took 2,5 h with some rulebook consulting while playing. So far only I've only found a couple small rules we played wrong. I liked the session very much. There was luck but also a tough decisions to be made.

You can get lucky with the dice or cards but there is enough meaty gaming underneath and it's not just about rolling dices. Core of the game seems to build around supply lines. You must pay close attention to them at all times and I can see how they easily can be game breaking if opponent can cut you off. 

The "fog of war" aspect works. There is tension as you cannot know for sure what there will be ahead if you attack. I like how the fact you cannot see your opponents pieces gives a chance for some bluffing. Same applies with playing supply cards to some extent. Bluffing options there doesn't feel all that necessary or perhaps I'm not yet experienced enough to see the possibilities.

I have positive expectations but this is a game you definitely need to play couple of times before you can see the whole picture. First scenario I played had a bit practice-scenario feel on it. But hopefully there will a second game at some point in near future so I can see how RitD lives to my (now pretty high) expectations.

Rommel in the Desert is an elegant and spine-tingling war game. It does not take long to play but it offers intriguing possibilities for strategies. I just love the way supply networks work in this game. True, you have to throw a lot of dice and that means luck plays a role. Luck, however, can be overcome by clever placing of units. You can win a campaign without winning a single combat and that is neat! All you need to do is cut enemy forces out of their supply network. Rommel in the Desert is a war game I can really get into and want to play more, much more.

RATING: 7
Based on one play: There are definitely a lot of rules and not major ones. So many rules as to supply routes and entering and leaving battle. Once you have some of the major rules down it gets a little easier but each time a new situation arrives then you must check the rules to ensure you don't miss a tiny distinction. Definitely a game that must be played several times before a final review is given.

Looks like a great game, but it's a little more complex than I play any more.  It's as close to mint condition as possible.  Game is unplayed, rulebook doesn't even look like it's been read.  Wooden blocks have the stickers put on, otherwise it is as close to new as possible.

RATING: N/A
There aren't a lot of games about the North African campaign during world war two, which is a shame as it's quite an interesting topic. Of those games that there are, this is kind of a stand out, and a bit of a classic. The noteworthy feature is the way the battles are resolved and the way the supplies cards have to be managed.

"Even without the allied offensive, I should have had to capitulate by the 1st June at the latest as I had no more to eat." - General Oberst von Arnim 

Supply rules in desert warfare.  Rommel in the Desert (RitD) is an excellent game that puts you in command of those desert forces.  The elite Afrika Corps is here in all of its glory, but heavily outnumbered as the war goes on.  The Italians are here, but slow and cumbersome.  The Allies are swift, but outgunned by the Afrika Corps until later in the war.  The blocks create the fog of war needed in this type of game.  The supply cards create their own fog of war of the supply situation.  There's lots of things you'd like to do with your troops, but do you have the supplies to pull it off?  Mobility is king here and shows well in the game mechanics.

RATING: 9
After a few solo plays and 3 real games, I can say this game has great depth particularly the supply rule.  The game is fun and need to think a lot, guessing all the supply cut possibility.  Although the movement rule is not that realistic, the game works more like chess than a war game, and there is nothing bad about it.  The only thing that I do not like, is that it is a bit based on luck; it happens more than once that I receive no real supply cards.  But I think it is still fine; if I need to minimize the luck factor I can simply add a house rule to let each player at least has 1 real supply card each turn.

The land area in this game is very small and confined. This makes for a game that is more focused than other grand scaled war games. The card system for supply creates and additional fog of war, as you never know exactly how much ability your opponent has to activate units.

Wow. The finest wargame I've ever played. Incredibly tense, with each decision packing the potential to be your fatal mistake. Plenty of scenarios, gorgeous maps and sturdy blocks. Elegant rules, just as complex as they need to be to capture the desert war. After more plays, may even ascend to a 10 ranking.

A fine game.  Tense, rewarding skill.  Few pieces but plenty of choices. Some scope for manouevre.  Scenarios vary from 2 hours through to 8 hours in duration.  There are some good ones in the 3-4 hour range.  Feels a bit more dynamic than East Front.  Everything fits together well to make a very playable game with a good historical feel.  The rules are short, but are poorly written, which is really the only strike against it.

RATING: 7
Two plays.  A solid game with the Italians running out of supply cards but the British running out of gasoline & water in the deep desert.  The gas and water proved to be more important because the Italians out manuvered the British with minimal supply and won the game!  
I had a lot of  fun.  We played with some rules wrong so I can't speak of the balance.  
This game is more complex that most block games and is not an ideal introduction to the series.  However it is a great depiction of the ebb and flow of the battle in the desert.  I've dropped the rating one point, the game is too complex to play often with my group, which means we have to relearn the rules each time we play.  <sigh>

The '8' I've given it is an approximate rating. I keep frustrating my opponents with supply problems, so I haven't gotten a chance to really dig in and see how good the game is or isn't once past the initial learning curve (which is steep--at least for strategy). At any rate, the supply rules are very nice, and just the thing to force a commander into the same quandaries as his counterparts. Beware of battles you don't have the supplies for!

My rating is on the original game, not the updated version.  My problem with this game is that, even though "fog of war" is accomplished, I can't get past the "feel" or "look" of blocks for this title.  I love block games, but the ones I play (1812, Napoleon, Quebec 1759, Bonaparte at Marengo, Napoleon's Triumph) are all easy to envision units of men drawn up in formation of the classical style of the period.  WWII games should have a different look to them.  Blocks just don't do it for me as I try to "see" tanks, planes, and irregular formations of men.

Es gibt nur wenige âAfrikakorpsâ-Spiele, die in einigermaÃen annehmbarer Zeit bewÃ¤ltigt werden kÃ¶nnen und zugleich wesentliche Aspekte dieses besonderen Kriegsschauplatzes simulieren: âRommel in the Desertâ, ein erst jetzt von mir âentdecktesâ Columbia-Game fÃ¼r zwei Spieler aus dem Jahr 1982 (!), ist ein solches Spiel. Es dauert etwa zwei bis drei Stunden und beide Spieler, insbesondere die deutsche Seite, âÃ¤rgernâ sich fortwÃ¤hrend Ã¼ber Nachschub. Supply ist langweilig? Stimmt. Bzw. stimmte bis jetzt. In diesem Game dreht sich â wie fÃ¼r den historischen Rommel â fast alles um Supply (das Supply-System wird wesentlich Ã¼ber Karten bedient). Das Spiel will also weniger eine taktische Simulation sein (hierzu existieren bislang auch noch keine wirklich guten Games), sondern auf operativer Ebene etwas von den Schwierigkeiten Rommels vermitteln. Selten wurden Probleme so attraktiv zum Hauptgegenstand eines Spiels.

This game is full of tension and agony - in a good way!  You never have enough of what you need to do what you want, so it is a constant balancing act on the knife edge of victory and defeat.  The limited intelligence, both the blocks and the supply cards, really makes this game.  There can be huge differences in troop strength and quality between single blocks, and a hand of cards might be full of fuel or worthless, so the bluffing and hidden information really shine.  This is the first wargame I remember playing that really demonstrated that avoiding a battle is usually the best option.

RATING: 8
A really enjoyable block game with multiple paths to victory. Keeping your supply lines solid as the Axis while committing enough units to take Tobruk is quite challenging, especially when you are unsure of your opponent's supply situation. I love the ebb and flow of the game: attack, withdraw, buildup. And the hexside limit rules make besieging a strong point a brain melting planning exercise.

One thing to bear in mind is that the game requires a fair bit of play and study before it starts to pay off. So you'll need an opponent who is happy to learn with you. It's not something you can just whip out on game night and quickly explain the rules to. In fact, the 40 page rulebook is pretty much at my limit of bang for the buck. Any denser ruleswise and I'd be forgetting more exceptions than I remembered, despite that fact that the rules are both mature and intuitive.

Also, the box does not contain everything you need to play the game. You will need to supply:
- at least 25d6 and a Medicare RSI claim form
- 2 x Mark Coomey's corrected player aid
- markers for hexside control and unsupplied units (we use go stones, white for unsupplied, black for  attacker hexsides)

Update: it's a 9 for sure... you need this game. It'd be a 10, but there are minor mana screw and dicefest elements that leave it short of perfection. 

And here begins my list of rules that I must remember:

- Unit granularity for targeting
- All of the supply checks
- Raider supply
- Rommel's move (I tend to forget about it when I need it most, sadly)

Update: demoting it a notch due to the impossibility of taking Tobruk, etc.

Classic block game.  I like it, but I can&#039;t get my head around the &quot;group/re-group&quot; mechanism.  What is it supposed to simulate?  Or is it an abstraction of some sort?

RATING: 4
Amazing wargame, with bluffing, asymmetry, and opportunity for shrewd, cut-throat maneuvers that really make you think "DESERT FOX!" as you see the blocks move around and fall in place.

But I cannot justify giving this above a 7, because of its presentation. It is a complex game, and it's made nearly un-learnable due to the horrendous presentation and lack of quick references. Player aids are a must. Some markers to keep track of things like friendly edge, supply lines etc would be welcome. The blocks have the shittiest, most unintuitive design ever, with little suggestion about their function without looking up the rulebook time and time again. They take away from the wonderful theme. The way the game is set up, there is simply too much leeway for a person to cheat in nearly every facet of the game. Sure, a player probably won't cheat intentionally, but the components, terrible board with tiny hexes, faint criss-crossing lines that look the same, and fiddly rules make it such that it's very easy for somebody to accidentally cheat.

As it stands, Napoleon's Triumph is better pound-for-pound, hour-for-hour, block-for-block.

Old-time wargamers can chide that the Eurogamers of today are spoilt, but that only shows why gems like Rommel have remained niche all this time to a select few no-lifers. This great game is in sore need of a remake or update. It deserves it.

Predates the [b]EuroFront[/b] series, but has much of the same conventions. The difference lies in the order of attack, determining which units can target which enemies in which order (e.g. AntiâTank can bypass other units and target Armour directly), and the uncertainty of supply, so characteristic of the North African Front.

Bluffing is a significant part of the game, with sweeping manoeuvres and bold gambles dependent on supply cards. This game brings to life the dramatic elements of the desert war that captured the imagination of contemporary civilians. Against a good Allied opponent, it can be very difficult for the Axis to win.

3 plays. Introductory 1940 scenario and twice with the Battle Axe scenario.

For me, this game is too complex and unforgiving. I can appreciate its design, but I also recognize that it just-isn't-for-me.

Pacific Victory, also by Columbia Games, is an example of the higher level of block game which is somewhat complex, but is still fun - and you don't live every single turn in fear of some minor oversight which can suddenly turn the time you've invested in the game into a complete and sudden loss. Rommel in the Desert is undoubtably a well made wargame that simulates the crucial nature of supply for that place and time - however, I must rate it on how much _fun_ it is to play for me. Unfortunately, for the amount of time required, I can think of many other games and wargames I would much rather play.

Most recent play 6-2-05. Garrett and Ben.

This is a tough game.  The potential consequences of failed logistics can be devastating. Because of this, it is easy to stare at your position for a while and try to figure out the puzzle of how to accomplish anything without your supply lines getting cut off.  The cliffs are wonderfully positioned to be an extreme pain in the ass.  Lots of good tension here, and I like that you have to shuttle your troops back to home base to step them up.  I can image that drawing poorly in this game would really change how you feel about it.  No fuel=no fun.

I have only a couple of games under my belt but I like this a lot.  At first glance Rommel seems simple but this gem has real depth.  Right from the outset the pressure is on.  The supply situation is critical for both sides and protecting your supply lines is imperative.  This game is unforgiving, and if you make a mistake or your supply line is cut, you can lose units like dominoes.  

With new block games out such as the brilliant Strike of the Eagle and Sekigahara, Rommel is showing its age.  A great game but there are newer and slicker productions out now that I would rather play.  eg. The above or [b] No Retreat: North Africa [/b] when it is released by GMT.

This is an excellent block wargame, only superceded by EastFront.  I would rate it higher, but it's unforgiving of mistakes, and I find it a shame that it's almost impossible to come back from one simple supply-line error.

Played 4 times this far, all solo. Once on the table, the rules become intuitive.

The good:
Interesting conflict
Fairly quick to set-up
Great gameplay (Except for congestion, see the bad)
Many scenarios and I see potential for good replayability
Unofficial play-aids found on BGG improves gameplay

The bad:
This game should have used counters as block congestion can make it somewhat difficult to keep track of those vital supply lines. Lowered rating from 9 to 8, based on this alone.
The cheap small supply cards (Just why?)
Fan-based play aids should be official ones that goes with the game (Columbia games, take notes).

It also happens to use an earlier (and just plain different) block system, which is partly why it's harder to grasp.  That doesn't make Rommel outdated, though.  It just means that the game is in a class of its own.

Features that make Rommel unique: a pairwise combat system (armor fights armor, infantry fights infantry), battles that last multiple turns (and can therefore be continuously reinforced), different move/combat turn options (activated with precious, and often scarce, supply cards), partial retreats and rearguard actions, redeployment capabilities, and supply networks that make or break players' grand strategic plans.

I have noticed, unfortunately, that Rommel isn't particularly welcoming to newcomers.  One obvious barrier is that the game, as already noted, is more complicated than the typical Columbia fare.  But other issues also get in the way, including two worth mentioning here: (1) many scenarios rely on open-ended unit deployments, which means that new players become frustrated because they don't know where to put their units or how to initially proceed, and (2) there is no hex stacking limit, so either player can dump all of their forces into one or two hexes - leaving the other player wondering how to break the apparent stand-off.

Certainly, Rommel would be more approachable if the publisher generated new scenarios with fixed opening set-ups.  And as far as moving past the "I'll put all my blocks in the same hex" strategy, a closer look at the game's victory conditions, hexside attack limits, and supply-cutting options should point newcomers in the right direction.

It's a shame, really, that Columbia is unlikely to release another block game that is as groundbreaking as Rommel was in its time.  The company now appears to be so drastically attached to their card-based group activation system and A/B/C combat procedures that other gaming models are either being ignored or reworked to fit that mold.  Here's hoping that Columbia continues to have an open mind to new approaches to block gaming, and is also able to recognize that every gaming vision might not fit their tried-and-true protocols.

That diatribe aside, Rommel in the Desert is good fun that - for an old-school classic - greatly exceeded my expectations.  Highly recommended.

Update:

Rommel is now my second favorite Columbia-style block game after Hammer of the Scots.  It's a high-tension survival exercise that is often decided by a critical forced march roll or a single high-stakes battle deep in the opponent's supply line, and that's part of its crazy desert charm.

Received via EBay. Rules are a nice mid-complexity, giving you enough choices to be interesting without being overwhelming.

Muy buen juego, mÃ¡s complejo de lo que aparentaba inicialmente. Muy bien pensado, y con deciones complicadas. El mÃ¡s denso de Columbia de los que he probado.

8/14/13:  I can't rate this game.  It's just way too intense for me.  Every single move seems to be crucial and, not only that, but I have to fight with every instinct I have not to get all of my units stuck in and not maintain some depth within my lines.  Golly I wish this game were slightly more relaxed, but then I guess it wouldn't be one of the greatest wargames of all time.

---Previously---

On account of its goodness, RitD is AT LEAST an 8.  Maybe if I play it again (and don't lose the entire German army to an errant (POS) British recon unit) my rating will rise.

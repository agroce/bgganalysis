The closest SPI ever came to a Euro-style game. Replacing the chits with cards would be a great improvement.

RATING: 5.5
Superb 'experiential' simulation of strategic international espionage:
* brief rules surprisingly cover all essential aspects of spycraft (above a single-character scale)
* components are wonderfully evocative
* play this for the experience, because it is fatally imbalanced*, due to how the game's mechanics (dis)advantage physical location {Britain will always wins, being isolated from land access to the continent; the USSR & France will compete to see which takes 2nd & 3rd place, since they are the extreme East & West continental players; and Germany & Italy will compete to see which takes 4th & 5th place, since they are in the center, thereby being most easily & often criss-crossed by all players}

* indeed, if rated purely for game play, it would be a 5.5 "flawed jem".

RATING: 9
Awesome game, without dice and little randomness (only when drawing the action chits, but this can be influenced by moving your spies in such a way that you receive lots of chits). You really can win by just looking at the other players' moves.

RATING: 6
Colorful, thematic, and unusual game of espionage in the years leading up to World War Two. The fun is in filching variously valued secrets from other countries. Obviosuly, you want to take the greatest prizes with your super-spies, but that's not easy, and counter-spies abound. Special cards that build the theme alter the game as the political situation in Europe deterioriates. Light fun for wargamers.

RATING: 4
A good theme, but one that the game essentially fails to capture. It seems that there is a great deal of redundancy in this game, but I can't quite pinpoint where it lies... What is this game    *really* about?  

Should take much less time to play, and involve more meaningful decision making. Not really keen to play again as other games do more with less.

Like Empire Builder, except you don't build track and you don't know what you're picking up until you get there. Oh, and you have to pick the right chits out of the cup.

RATING: 7.1
Actually a very fun game.  Probably best to discourage "diplomacy" as it tends to slow down the action.  Reading the event tiles aloud on the other hand is a good use of time.  Not a good game for the vindictive, you generally need to be pursuing your interests, not sabotaging someone else's.

I haven't played this in a while but remember having a good time with it.  Moving spies around Europe in the WWII era is a fun thing, and watching a movie like "Casablanca" gets me in the mood to play.  I'd like to see this one re-produced as it's a fun theme and can have interesting play interaction.  I see some variant rules on this website so maybe I'll check them out and play it again.

Single play, all newbies. I rather enjoyed the game, but we had great doubts about how Events worked. It seems we played it right, but the concept of sending spies to linger in certain cities on the off chance that an opponent will play a particular event tile just seems too haphazard a way to get action chits & cash into the game, and can lead to a frustratingly static situation.

As a non-participant, I got to watch this crash and burn last night.  Folks played for an hour, and then they just... stopped.

We don't play outdated games for the same reason we don't dig up our great-grandparents and enter them into marionette competitions.  Because reanimated corpses are never as fun and flexible as you think they'll be.

This is a cool game but hard to get to the table with so many other games that my group would rather play. I like it though and I am waiting for another chance to play it.

UPDATE: had a chance to play this again recently and boy did I underestimate this game. What a pleasure to play. Rules are fairly easy to digest though not the best example of well written rules. I suggest for new players that a full turn is played and then the game restarted to teach how it works. Otherwise everyone new will make detrimental mistakes in the first turn or two.

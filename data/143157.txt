*Rating based on one play.

Fun little game.  It is quite literally multiplayer solitaire, but with enough bells and whistles to make it interesting.  The rolls and action cards allow for some luck mitigation, and the sinking mechanic is clever.  It's okay as a coop, but I'd imagine it's more fun as a solo game.  Seems like it'd be something fun to do while watching TV or killing a bit of free time.

+ Shockingly deep decisions based on board state, available actions, and your given character; Plays solo quickly and is still fun.
- Despite the rules for multiple players, this game is really only suited for 1 or 2 (possibly).

Brilliant card game! Not just your old "solitaire" card game as some say. The theme pulls you in, you want to save the people from the sinking ship. The special abilities also adds to the adventure. It blows my hair back.

Another good solitaire game. And by that we mean you can play it by yourself and that it is literally the game Solitaire with the theme of Titanic on it. It plays just like you'd expect it to with a few character powers and a game board that it replaced with a spiral bound book that shows the iconic ship slipping beneath the water.

SOS Titanic is a solitaire-style card game (even if playable in a cooperative way) with some twists.

The goal (like in most solitaires) is to pile cards from 1 upwards: 1s are the lifeboats, the other cards are the passengers.

The first twist is that you can turn 1-6 cards from the deck (depending on your character). If you fail to find a playable card the timer of the game advances (a page of the booklet must be turned), but when the deck is exhausted the timer advances either... so the number of turned cards is not an auto-choice.

The second twist is of course the booklet-timer: every two or three pages turned, the piles of cards are shuffled, and you lose the order of the already placed cards.

The third twist is the action cards, giving some special plays to the players.

All considered, is a gorgeous little game, and a very enjoyable solitaire.

RATING: 2
Gorgeous game with a great theme and noble goal. I had high hopes that this game would serve the purpose of Klondike (solitaire), except with the addition of thematic context and visual appeal. Unfortunately, I found that despite the bells and whistles, this game just felt pointless. It begged the question, "why ruin solitaire with all of this nonsense?" Entire rows of cards get smashed into the row next to them, combining the two. After this happens a few times, you've got a column of 20 cards with 1 revealed at the bottom. How are you ever going to be able to work through that? No matter how many times I played it, I just couldn't get this to feel fun or engaging.

Probably a 0.5 bump because of the theme. The way the turning of the pages (sinking) speeds up as time passes is accurate to the sinking and a neat trick! There is some luck with it but make sure to lay out cards during set up not by column but by row, in order to get a good shuffle.Changed anchor score rule from 60 point (perfect game)threshold to 40.

This is not easy as a solitaire game. Much like Friday which I think is fantastic solo game. This is right up there. The theme fits. Yes it's a solitaire klondike type game. But if you like Keltis and Lost Cities you will like this. Lots of more choice in this one. Think Lost cities with cool mechanism choices to change the game. Still haven't beaten it. 10 times i have played high point total 28.

RATING: 9
Wonderful thematic take on Solitaire.  Seriously, it's like solitaire with a story.  The game really gives you a purpose for flipping and lining up cards, as each decision could mean the loss of life.  I found myself making the horrible decision of putting a child (#3) back into the discard pile late in the game, almost completely sentencing him to death, because I thought I could save more lives by getting a badly need adult (#8) card.  (I did draw a card that allowed me to search the discard pile for any passenger, and saved that small child, but oh that question of morality lingered).  The game gives you a finite yet not so arbitrary time limit, as each time you shuffle your passenger deck, the Titanic sinks further into the depths.  This punishes you even more as, you lose "decks", your carefully made lines have to be reshuffled, with the first available line of cards.  Overall, just a fun take on an old game.  It adds action cards and crew abilities that might offset some of the setbacks the new mechanics bring.

Essentially just classic solitaire re-themed as getting passengers off the Titanic and into lifeboats.

The twist on solitaire is that the boat is slowly sinking, so as you fail at certain things in the game, the left-most column of cards will have to flee the back of the ship as it fills with water.  When the passengers flee, they get shuffled with the next column up, messing up any progress you had made in those columns.

While the game is entertaining enough, it really doesn't benefit from playing with other players, as it's really just a solitaire exercise.  A neat little gimmick to turn solitaire into a "real game" though!

This is a lovely little game, based on the 'Patience' mechanic. It is much more than the just a rehash of Parience though. It has crew member cards with different abilities, and action cards that are crucial to helping you rescue the passengers. The game includes a ring-bound book showing the Titanic sinking as the game progresses. The production quality of the game is very high, and it is very thematic. It plays brilliantly as a solitaire game.

Alone, or co-operating with other crew members, you must show presence of mind and do the right thing to save as many passengers as possible. Cards representing passengers who must be arranged on the decks, then placed in the lifeboats in a particular order. Move and arrange these passengers as quickly as you can. Each section of the Titanic holds a pile of cards of which only the first is available.

This is basically a highly souped-up, multiplayer Klondike variant. On the plus side, after hearing the rules explained, I fully expected it to suck hard and it didn't. There are actually a fair number of meaningful decisions to make. On the minus side, there are many other things I'd rather play, given 45 minutes and a tableful of friends.

I would rate this higher purely as a solitaire game -- maybe a 6.5. This is certainly more interesting as a solitaire exercise than plain ol' Klondike!

I do like Klondike on the PC from time to time as I find it's puzzle solving nature quite refreshing. When I read about SOS Titanic, I was expecting something similar. A nice distraction for half an hour.

After trying the game a few times now, I must say that I'm a little underwhelmed by it. I can't really put my finger on what bothers me about SOS Titanic, but somehow the gameplay isn't as a satisfying as a round of Klondike is. It seemed, as if the action cards and special abilities of the crew members are in the game to replace the row management aspect of Klondike. But it was just this feature of Solitaire that I do value the most and that I'm missing here. Somehow it all feels to random to me. I'll give the game another chance, but right now the outlook isn't positive.

Simple Klondike variant where the players are trying to meld four suits of passengers onto their lifeboat foundations.  The mechanics are heavily inspired by Klondike, but with the crew character cards dictating how many cards you may draw, but you can only meld one of what you draw.  The foundering of the ship is represented by a neat flip-book, that accelerates the game, forcing columns to be shuffled into each other as the ship sinks.  Event cards give players tactical options.  Nice game, well done.

Such an elegant design! I have only played it solo so far, so I can't say how it plays with 2 or more players, but it's just such a clever, beautiful twist on solitaire. I feel lke the theme comes through, helped by the top-notch card art and the fantastic booklet mechanism. The character and action cards are obviously the wonkiest part of the game, but also give it more replayability than you may ever need. That being said, I did eventually let go of it for space considerations, and also because solo playing isn't a focus for me. But part of me misses it.

An enjoyable game, with heavy luck elements but the game is set up to create quite a bit of tension with what cards will come up. The decisions that need to be made (how many passengers to draw, how to use action cards, when to hold off to get anchor chains) adds just enough decision making to this game to make it feel like a solid variant of Solitaire. Solitaire, of course, is all luck, and that game is decided as soon as the cards are first shuffled. Not so for SOS:T, which definitely feels more interesting than its grandfather game. Plus, the theme is so enjoyable that SOS:T is a solid time-passer. It is a game to play while waiting for something else to happen, but definitely a good way to spend 30 minutes.

SOS Titanic is a fun spin on Klondike. The art is beautiful. The book doesn't really add to the gameplay but it helps in organizing & emphasizing the theme of the game.

I have yet to try any multiplayer games but the solo games are fun when playing both as single or multiple crew members.

The book mechanic is pure genius.  I'm not sure the theme and gameplay tie together well, but you do get a feeling of impending doom as the pages flip.

Brilliant re-theming of a tried and true solitaire card game. Frustrating but addictive.

I've come back to the game after a long time away and still enjoy it.  There is tension, and you have to manage the Passenger deck very, very carefully.

72 points with Reginald Lee is my solo high.

SOS Titanic does great job of masking its patience mechanic. So far, I've only played it solo (and played the two-player setup as a solo, which I prefer at the moment). The best thing about this game is that it never feels like the time-wasting activity that you would think it would be. The decisions feel meaningful, the theme comes through amazingly, and the tension of a real multiplayer game is there. I've played SOS Titanic multiplayer once (I didn't like it as much), but this is probably the only game I could see myself playing purely solo for years and years. So far, I'm at around 50 plays.

The booklet that comes with the game is brilliant, a great idea that you turn the page of the book to advance the sinking of the ship.  The game itself seemed fine, just not great.  You're effectively playing solitaire but with more advanced rules, there are also cards that let you manipulate the cards in more interesting ways but they lacked some variety, or at least we played the same ones many times which lacked depth.

I liked how there's no win/lose, you simply try to do better each time.  Worth a try.

Incredibly simple, but incredibly addictive! I have found it fairly easy, but we'll see on further plays.
It is really easy to learn. Great production values. Wife loves it! Solid game! Better if you make a point of separating anchor cards from non-anchor cards in the lifeboats!

Addictive "patience" gameplay mechanic, with a thematic link to rescuing passengers from the titanic.  SOS Titanic is a well-designed game, with nice components and artwork.  I enjoy the relaxing, uncomplicated gameplay.

RATING: 5
A somewhat interesting game, but ultimately (at least solo) it's still Klondike, which means the game can start beautifully and then just lock up, or it can look hopeless from the beginning and then suddenly produce some leaps forward.  That can be exciting, but the enjoyment is very inconsistent.  The action cards and roles in this game mix it up a bit, but to me it still feels, in the end, like Klondike.  For my gaming time, there are better options.

SOS Titanic is to Patience what Augustus is to Bingo. While nominally it's cooperative play for 1-4 players, there's no single reason to play this with others. Just take more than one character. Fine for patient moments as a passtime. As usual for Patiences, the initial layout determines if there's any chance to win, decisions are mostly obvious.

SOS Titanic takes the classic card game Solitaire and makes it a game I like to play. The theme and its integration, the pressure and the sense of escalation in the game... all these add up and make it a much better game.

Clever solitaire or coop variation on Klondike (patience) with crew who can use special actions to move lines of cards (passengers) around. Hard but not impossible like, say, Space Hulk Death Angel. You score points for those you save. Ring-bound book whose pages turn and show the boat sinking is especially thematic. Replayability through the choice of crew who all have special abilities.

I'd heard about this, and I tend to like Cathala and Maublanc stuff, but it's cooperative, which is the death knell for my groups. Still, I was eager to try it out. It's...okay. Basically themed Patience Solitaire with special powers and a timer, there is some decision making and tension here, but given the nifty fold-out book and the lovely design, you can't help but wish you were playing a better game. It also didn't help that the two of us did very well on our first play and even better on our second.

Really love this clever little game! It's a super take on Solitaire but with crew member and action cards that change it up enough. It's easy to learn and fast to play.

One of our favourite filler games.

Great little Klondike game. Perfect for solo play. Sure there is luck involved but also decisions to be made. 

The theme is fantastic. Women and children first = brilliant.The melding of lines when a section of the ship breaks off is pretty true to life. I like the cards (although some complain about the shape) the fact they are boarding passes is a nice touch. The detail about the musicians as kings is also thematic. 

Looking forward to more plays.

This game is a great solitaire game; the game is pretty straight forward and plays quickly. 

Now played multiplayer is does have the feel of a multi-player solitaire. I enjoy it more as a solo-game.

Choosing the right character and playing the correct actions cards in a timely manner is the key to scoring high but it can be easily undone by bad luck in the card draws.

SOS Titanic is a slightly souped-up version of the card game Klondike (otherwise known simply as solitaire).  In it you act as a member of the Titanic crew, complete with special ability, attempting to save as many passengers as possible before the ship sinks.  Every passenger card depicts someone from either first, or second class.  As time goes by, and you fail to place passengers into lifeboats, you flip pages in a picture book that show the Titanic progressively sinking further into the icy North Atlantic Ocean.  You win if you get all the passengers into lifeboats.  Otherwise, you score based on the highest valued cards/passengers you saved.

The box says it plays 1-5, but I don't know why you'd ever play with more than one, as this is at its heart solitaire.  Though the theme of saving passengers from the Titanic ratchets up the tension and interest over ordinary, tired-old Klondike.

This is now my go-to solitaire game if I want something quick to play.  I really like the added sense of importance that getting people to the lifeboats brings.  The components are very nice as well.  High recommendation.

RATING: 5.5
Many games I own have solitaire variant but I've never bothered with those. This game is small and short enough to merit setting it up for solo. I'm always happy when designers find way to improve classic mechanics (here klondike/patience/solitaire), this is great example of success in that. I've tried one other solo game, Onirim, it never really grabbed me, but I can see myself playing this one when in waiting room or something.

2-Player Comment:
*It doesn't really have 2p mechanics, but if you can see yourself playing solitaire with 2 then it's a good 2p game.

Since most people already know the mechanics of Klondike deck building, you're able to spend your time enjoying the gameplay nuances of this game, like the action cards and the challenge of not mixing two different classes of passengers into the same line. This is very challenging  because you are playing against "time", but light. The game is out of publication, but a few copies can be found online for about $30. Having the book slowly sink the ship is just a brilliant twist to this solitaire game.  Check out the YouTube videos on how to play this game for more precise details.  But if you can snag a copy of this game, do it!

Really, really good solitaire game. I keep coming back because "I know I can do better". The crew member abilities and action cards make a dramatic impact on the game and change up your play every time.

This is a great game, which takes the classic Solitaire card game and adds new strategic considerations along with a heaping helping of theme. Most themes -- especially in card games -- are just "add-ons," but not here: the theme really enhances and drives the game experience.  Have only played this game solitaire, but it makes for a worthwhile 30-45 minute diversion back to April 14-15, 1912.

---- Preliminary thoughts ----

This is the Klondike Solitaire with variable card manipulation powers and collapsible lines.

The mods are very cool, they give you quite a few options and the game is very streamlined.

It has a scoring system that allows you to keep track of how well you did even if you don't manage to save all the passengers.

The art is OK, not great,but the flippable Titanic book is a cool thing.

Once you have this, you'll never want to play Klondike again. I just don't see this being a multiplayer game.

An excellent game in a solitaire card game type style. The theme creates great intensity to this game. A great game for 1 and 2 players (so far the only number of players we have tried). The flip book really makes the game great. You are trying to get everyone off the ship before it sinks. Each player begins with a ship crewman with a special power. And there are 4 decks with passengers to start the game. You will be drawing a certain number of passenger cards and adding them to the passengers on the decks of the ship. They are added in descending numerical value and according to class or they can be added to the rafts in ascending numerical value and according to class. As you have success adding passengers to the decks all is well, but when you cannot add a passenger to a deck the book page is flipped showing the Titanic sinking deeper underwater.

As the game progresses and the ship starts to take on water, the decks become submerged causing passengers to panic and run to the next deck higher. When this happens the higher deck gets shuffled of all it's passengers.

Surprisingly thought-provoking, even moving, SOS Titanic is a title even non-gamers take to instantly. Maybe it's the combination of the familiar Patience game engine, the novel flip-book, and of course the Titanic story.
Recommend trying this with Gavin Bryar's 'The Sinking of the Titanic' playing in the background.
In truth, this game (just like the ubiquitous James Cameron film before it) doesn't touch at all on certain key aspects of the Titanic story, such as the ship's inadequate number of lifeboats (White Star didn't want them dangling all over its glorious new flagship, it would've spoiled the graceful lines), and the controversy surrounding the SS Californian's non-intervention, so as a work of art on a real event it doesn't really work as regards fidelity to the facts. But on the emotional level, it's a triumph.

Feels like Patience+. Fun filler to play solo or coop.

RATING: 7
Lay the cards out patience style and try and get them to the lifeboats (where you build from Ace up) before time runs out. The first wibble is that you can pick from 1 to 5 cards from the deck when it's your turn (depending on your character). You can only play 1, so you don't want to draw more than 1 playable card, but failing to find a play means the timer runs down. Also, each time you run thru the deck you get a fail, so auto-going for 5 every turn ain't so hot either. This is one of the fun features ... making a call and cheering together when a brave low call works or getting smacked upside the head when a brave low call fails. This feeling of being in it together is probably the only need for multiple players though. The second wibble is that every 2 or 3 times you get a fail, the leftmost pile gets shuffled into the next pile along, losing a pile spot, making it harder. Nice. Thirdly, you get action cards which allow you to manipulate decks and piles. But it really still is a solo affair, as extra players don't have any extra information or positional element to provide player differentiation. Having said that, it's a nice re-implementation of Patience and the theme shines. You've got to love that booklet as the timer (each fail means you turn to the next page to show the Titanic sinking further), and the cards where women and children are placed on those that will be placed in the lifeboats first. And eerily often look like movie stars. Using the actions wisely is the key, as is memorising the deck, knowing the proportion of now-playable cards to non-playable cards to help determine how many to draw, and which are the most important cards to get out next to free up the locked cards in the piles. We scored well in our first game so there's not a lot to explore here in multi-player, but if you like Patience solo, then this provides an engaging implementation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
You're too busy trying to save as many passengers as you can while the massive luxury ship continually and hopelessly sinks that you take no notice that SOS Titanic uses a modified version of the solitaire Klondike mechanism to become the awesome and classy solo/co-op game it is. The gameplay really fits the theme. On par with Onirim. Re-playable through many crew members, and difficulty levels. Easy to learn and teach. Games are quick.

An unusual co-op, but interesting as the crew works together to whittle away at saving the passengers. The downtime is minimal, but the engagement is mostly everyone helping remember what may still be in the decks and lines. Thus, this won't be for everyone.

"Very clever spin on 'patience' solitaire. The theme is not strong, but helps. The card quality is great."

- Not a big fan of the theme

Just like regular solitaire sometimes you get a deck setup that just isn't possible to beat.  Because of this you make the fun decision of do I try to go ahead and save these people and get a fixed amount of points or do I try to do some line manipulations to try to eek out a win.  Really fun game.

Picked up at Hairy Tarantula Dec 24th on my way to Xmas sleepover and dinner. 

Rulebook was outside box under plastic. Back cover of coilbound event tableau has hairline indenty scritches all over it. 

Was it that way for anyone else? 

Solitaire is a bit dull. I mean the traditional card game of laying out a deck of cards and trying to get them all piled up on the aces. 

SOS Titanic is soliaire, but it's timed and you have abilities. Coool!

I think I may be in the minority here, but I thought this game was absolutely dull playing it solo. It wasn't until I had a full table of 5 players that I really had fun with it. Solo relies way too heavily on getting a good starting character, while multiple characters have a better chance of finding a nice balance.

RATING: 8.1
This game is a really good solo game.  It takes the card game solitaire and puts it to a titanic theme.  The theme incredibly works using the solitaire mechanics with the added thematic action cards and the character card special abilities.  It really does feel like you are lining up people to put on the lifeboats starting with children then women then men within the two different classes. Components are great quality too.  Great light solo game that I see getting play often by myself when looking for a quick satisfying solo game.

I like the theme of the game and the game mechanic to turn a page in the book to indicate the progression of time. The book shows the titanic and how it goes under. The artwork is great and the game plays well.

In the test game we've played at essen fair he cards were not shuffled well. Therefore we first drew the cards in the correct order from the deck and it was very easy the 3 players of us to save all passengers. I also think there are ways to increase the difficulty level, e.g. by starting not on he first page but the 2nd, 3rd, and so on.

I think this game is also perfectly suited for solo play.

It's a cooperative game. In general I don't like cooperative games. Therefore I don't give it a personal ranking.

Ez egy tematizált pasziánsz, némi upgraddel.
A játék minősége és kivitele igen meggyőző. Viszonylag kis doboz (bár igazából csak 90 kártya és egy spirálfüzet a tartalom), hangulatos, minőségi rajzok, egyedi kártyaformátum. Szóval jól összerakták, a Ludonaute hozza a tőle szokásos szintet.
Ami a szabályokat illeti: a mindenki által jól ismert pasziánszon alapszik a játék, amelyhez jó tematikát illesztettek, hiszen idővel egyre jobban szűkülnek be a lehetőségeink, akárcsak egy süllyedő hajón.
Változatosságot a szerepek és az akciókártyák jelentenek valójában. Sajnos ez azonban pár kérdést is generálhat, talán nem véletlen, hogy a játék hivatalos oldalán közzé is tettek egy FAQ-t.
Mindenki bátran tehet vele egy próbát, aki szereti az egyszemélyes játékokat. A kooperatív mód ilyen szempontból csak egy marketing fogás, nem érzem, hogy bármivel is többet adna úgy a játék, mint a kártyákat egyedül rakosgatva. Mindent összevetve teljesen reálisnak érzem a BGG helyezését.
Nem egy mestermű, de szépen össze van rakva, kellemes kis filler, ha az embernek akad fél órája.

This was much better than I expected. The full colour flip book really added to the game, and the action cards made the choices interesting. It was actually reasonable to play through which, given that it's a co-op, is high praise from me! But it is a co-op and is very much subject to quarter backing, so I won't be looking to play this again.

The components are lovely, the packaging just right, and the rule book well enough written. However, once I "won" on my second game (neglecting that it's really about score, and not a binary win/lose distinction), I didn't care enough to try again. I felt that that was enough; I had seen enough of the game to not need to see any more.

Instead, I wanted to go play [thing=43570][/thing] again. [thing=43570][/thing]'s graphics and components are comparatively inferior, but the tension and elation it offers are more worth the investment.

Japanese edition. Language edition.

A solitaire variant with a Titanic theme. You are trying to create rows of 'passengers' and getting them off the ship before it goes down. Special action cards and the abilities of a pre-assigned crew member allows you to break the rules (ie: sift through the deck to search for a card etc).

The thematic link is the slowly sinking ship: triggered by events, you flip the pages of the boat and the number of passenger links gets lesser and lesser.

Flaws? If your cards are badly seeded, you'll be riding out the game with no hope of doing well.

Beautifully presented. Great art and the book is not necessary but really well done.

Played twice at GenCon 2013 with Anne-Cécile from Ludonaute.  This is a FANTASTIC game design.  The Klondike-like card play combined with the theme, cooperative game play, and player powers makes this game interesting, tricky, and fun. In addition, it is even approachable by casual gamers, friends, and family due to the familiar game mechanisms and attractive artwork.  As an added bonus, this game can be played solo!

SOS Titanic and Lewis & Clark were the two best games that I played at GenCon 2013. They will be instant buys for when they are released (sadly, there weren't any copies for sale at GenCon).

After a few plays, I like this game even more.  The game drips with theme, and somehow converts a game of solitaire into a worthwhile, exciting game.  

My favorite game was a 5 player game.  It was challenging, and everyone had to really help out.  When everyone started to realize their role in how to help the people of the Titanic, then things started to fall into place.

Great little game!

SOS Titanic had a lot of indie buzz when it came out and it's a theme that I know very well. I also enjoy the occasional solo game and do like Klondike (or Solitaire.) And the game is a good representation of all of those things...except for the character cards. For me, they almost ruin the experience as the powers don't seem very well balanced across different player counts. The ones that are particularly annoying are the ones that don't give you very many (if any) action cards, which is what makes this game unique and different from regular Klondike. I don't play it much anymore and I do still like it, but if this is ever redone, I hope they take another look at the characters.

A nice variant on classic Solitaire. Great components and nice artwork make this fun to look at. There are role cards you get at the beginning which give your character a special ability and there are action cards that help you mitigate the luck of the deck stacking, hopefully giving you a better chance at winning.

How this EVER got recommended for Spiel des Jahres I'll never know...kind of makes me question the whole SdJ brand.

Only played as a solo game.

I was wary of this as I'd heard it was based on patience/solitaire. It is, but the designers have added a lot in terms of gameplay and decision making to modernise it and make it playable by today's standards.

Update: It actually works quite well as a co-op, albeit a number of turns become a little dull for some players - for exmaple one of our players got only to shuffle the deck on about 4 turns...

RATING: 9
Update:  15 games...
The game still intrigues me, but also ticks me off at times when it simply locks up.  Certain characters will provide little in tight situations.  I almost want to refuse to play with a character that does not provide me with a limited, regular supply of action cards.  

I have to laugh because there are certain faces I simply don't like anymore.  They always seem to come up with things are going wrong.  

Still addicted, however and now my wife is into it.

Update:  After 5 games the game is growing in fascination.  I have begun to grow an attachment to certain characters and there's a personal quality to it the intensifies.  I find myself thinking things like:  "I can't let that line of people sink" or "Yes! I saved the little girl at least..."  Granted, there is a luck factor.  But, it's just so addictive for a game of solitaire.  Really wonderful game.

For a solo play game (I have not played coop yet), this game beats out Friday for me.  I love how smoothly it plays.  Though it is solitaire with flair, I have to say, the theme really does come out strongly.  The book is central in the theme's "surfacing" so well.  The faces are beautifully illustrated and haunting.

This game has a ton of replayability in it as well with all the solo characters available.  

The quality of the game and cards is wonderful and best of all, the rules were incredibly well written with just (as usual) a few minor questions taken care of here on BGG.

Highly recommended.  I'm thinking possible SdJ contestant too.

I wanted to like this game, but in the end it just felt like a themed, multiplayer game of solitare. I wasn't ever worried of sinking the ship, though that may have more to do with good luck on the shuffling.

It was okay solo, but I have other solo games I rather play.

Not very satisfying. Usually in fully cooperative games you eiher win or you lose together. This one feels like your one aim can only be to try and collect as many points as possible while losing nevertheless, since it can become impossible to solve this. Impossible not necessarily because of bad play but because of an unfortunate distribution of the cards. And to finish with many points when Titanic sinks is not the kind of feeling I want to get out of a coop. It's not a bad activity - mediocre is the word I had in mind right after the game - but I would never actively propose for this game to hit the table and if asked for it by others I would at least try to change their minds and try to get them sold on another, better game.

I really wanted to like this. At first it was fun. I played more than 10 games of it (all solo). After this, I realized, that the main problem of a patience is not solved here: sometimes the cards just don't allow the game to be won. When all the 1's are covered up by other cards it is very hard to get them out of there. The special action cards try to solve this, but they are not enough. The result is, that even after more than 10 games my ability to win the game did not increase. Winning and losing all came down to luck.
So, all in all, SOS Titanic is definitely better than other patiences, but the ambition to try to do it better vanished for me.

I'm not one for cooperative games or solitaire games, but this one took me by surprise.  Yes, it's a riff on [thing=10400]Patience/Solitaire[/thing], but it adds enough differences to make it worth playing.  It's a little weird playing through a game with a history that I'm pretty familiar with (I don't know enough about history to feel that connection with wargames, but I do know a lot about Titanic), but it's a neat system.  I don't see that I would ever play it as a cooperative game, but for a solitaire game, it has a nice challenge level without so much stuff going on that it's easy to lose track of the course of the turn.

RATING: 9
Yes, it is "just" Patience (or Solitaire, or Klondike, or whatever you call it) with a few twists. So why the big deal?

Well, first of all, Solitaire is one of the most addictive games out there. Each office I have ever been to has someone with too little tasks sit somewhere who play solitaire all day. For years (Hi Neal!). SOS Titanic feeds of the "one more time" feeling that is the inevitable outcome of a close game of Solitaire.

However, what makes SOS Titanic truly special is MULTIPLAYER. Being addicted to Solitaire by yourself is one thing. Sharing the experience is both new and unique. To put it bluntly, this is the first 2P coop that really deserves its name. We actually play TOGETHER to get everyone of the sinking ship since there are so many possible moves that a single player might easily overlook. 

This is definitely one of our absolute favorite games at the moment, so I am happy I found fitting card sleeves. Please put out an expansion!

RATING: 8
I love this game for its sheer creativity. For the most part, it's merely a game of Klondike Solitaire. The difference being instead of alternating colors in each column, you must instead only play cards of the same color in each one. Equating the different suits with different social classes is a fantastic piece of dark social commentary (and history).

The other aspect of the game design that is worthy of praise is the illustrated book which acts as a timer, depicting the Titanic quickly sinking with every pass through the draw deck.

This works equally well as a solitaire game or as a co-op. It seems like the English printings are pretty tough to get a hold of, so if you see one, grab it. You won't be disappointed.

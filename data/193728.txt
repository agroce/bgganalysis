COIN goes Britannia. Looks like (is) the hardest rules in the series. Love the theme (the historical setting). The map is  mint, the card artwork not so.

Initial rating after one play. I need more plays to wrap my head around this one.  Pendragon I think is a great entry in the COIN series with some really neat new rules.  I think the one big issue I had with Pendragon is how the battles are easily mathed out.  

For the time investment I still would prefer to get a full fledged war game to the table.  Still great games and Pendragon will probably go down as one of my favorite in the series.

Playtested this game at Prezcon one year...three times. Loved it. There have been comments that it is more complex than the COINs. That surprised me as I found the system to actually be simpler, just a little different...in good ways. My other favorite COIN is A Distant Plain.

Feb '18: After my first play, it feels way too chromey. It's like they kept adding subsystems and increasing the territory # that makes it slower than the other Brittania title, Falling Sky, which I think I enjoy more.

This has very quickly become one of my favorites in the COIN series. The interplay between the factions is great and the model of the deterioration of Roman rule in Britain is quite compelling. There are many sub-systems within the game and all of them are (to my thinking) flawless.

COIN system is great for club gaming, which can grabs the attention of four at the same time while the game can be completed in just an afternoon.  The abstractions at strategic level are somewhat too much to my taste but the historical narrative of the game is rich.  You can always learn something from the system about the strategic development of the war in subject.  I have many games of the COIN and it sounds like a bit wear-off now.  So I delay the purchase of this game and the other new one on American Revolution.  However, I am sure I will get them someday because you just can't afford to loose them in your complete COIN collection, can you?

Fantastic adaptation of COIN mechanics to Dark Age Britain during the Roman Imperial decline. Engaging and well-balanced factions with thought-provoking assymetry. Have quite enjoyed the new features of Raiding and Plunder, cleverly tied into Prosperity and Population. Exciting to play, great new Battle system.  The Imperium status offers changing victory conditions and faction interplay which forces deep strategic planning, and oftentimes, challenging decisions.   On par with Fire in the Lake in terms of complexity, and quickly rivaling FitL as a new favourite.

Fourth Coin I've played, fascinating subject, some interesting design ideas but ultimately fell flat for me.  Played the Scotti and found the faction extremely unsatisfying.  Admittedly, I'm not the savviest strategist and I'm basing this off of one play so I'm ignorant of much of the requisite subtlety of play.  That said, the events were largely uninspiring, the command/feat options imbalanced and limited such that operations were largely predictable and repetitive.  Part of the appeal of COIN is that every faction feels like they're losing for the majority of the game.  This appeal diminishes when that feeling degenerates into one of futility.  As I've said before, I'm sure there was loads I'm missing that makes this assessment unfair and it may improve with further plays, which I am willing to invest, but I never felt like I was just going through the motions like this in my other COIN plays.  I'm also not a fan of the apparent binary nature of faction strategy.  Granted there are elements of this in other COIN, but not exaggerated to this degree.  The Dux and Civitates factions are primarily fire-fighting while the Barbarians get to play offense (albeit uninteresting offense),  This makes me less inclined to sample the Roman factions and, again, diminishes the appeal of the overall product.

RATING: 10
Pure genius. Probably my favorite COIN entry in the series, finally dethroning Liberty or Death. 

I was skeptical at first about the departure of the well-loved support/oppose mechanic and insurgent pieces, but Pendragon does something that no other COIN games have.

The imperium track is not just a tacked-on mechanic, it effectively and severely affects the flow of the game. You truly feel a difference between Roman Rule, Autonomy, and then finally Fragmentation. It is like 3 different games in a box, and to me that is absolutely genius. 

It is also very apparant that the designer enjoys the COIN series for the political interplay between the assymetric factions, and you get those subtleties in spade with Pendragon.

My only nitpick with the game, is the artwork on the box and the event cards. They look like old computer games from the late 90s. I wish they had used drawings instead, but I understand that when you have to design over a hundred cards, people gotta save production money somewhere. The game board however, dont get me wrong, is absolutely gorgeous. Liberty or Death level, if not better.

Beau boulot, Marc, c'est vraiment un masterpiece ton jeu.

Sometimes I like the idea of COIN games more than actually playing them. This is the farthest off the path of the other COIN games which makes me like it that much more. It will be a beast to grok fully though.

A very interesting period of history that I knew nothing about. A huge plus.

GMT´s COIN Series Game #8, designed by [person=89035][/person] and [person=772][/person]

Supposedly to be the most complex COIN game.

[i]
Volume VIII in GMT’s COIN Series transports us into the 4th and 5th Centuries A.D. and to the embattled Isle of Britannia. Pendragon – The Fall of Roman Britain covers a century of history from the first large-scale raids of Irish, Pict, and Saxon raiders, to the establishment of successor kingdoms, both Celtic and Germanic. This sumptuous volume adapts the celebrated asymmetrical COIN engine to depict the political, military, religious, and economic struggles of Dark Ages Britain.[/i]

Watching this one. 

Speculation: that's going to become a rather heavy COIN. The board map displays a lot of areas and many units, which will make it harder to keep the overview.

Solo playthroughs of the first 2 scenarios, which give a great snapshot of the game (1st is all about the 2 raiding factions attacking an intact Roman state of 2 relatively united factions; in the 2nd, the state is fragmented and nearly in ruins, low population and low prosperity, and it's every factions for themselves).  The rules really aren't as complex as some may have you think.  This is my first COIN game and I can grasp it fine.  Optimal strategy is of course more opaque.  It could use a few more player aids though, for final victory margins, a simpler battle outline, and an assault table (there's one "hidden" on the back of the non-player guidelines sheet).  I really like how the dice just affect whether you are able to ambush/evade/coup de main, not whether your units hit or not, and that failing to ambush/evade doesn't make you any weaker (so you just decide which to do and always roll - there's no risk analysis the player needs to make to decide to roll or not).  Overall, the setting and history is really well-integrated into how the game dynamics play out.  Like most CDG's it has the problem of trying to pack a lot of history into a randomly shuffled event deck, events which will often not take place, and the game won't really teach you much history unless you read about them in the playbook, but already knowing much of the history, I am able to envision it playing out in the interaction of the factions trying to achieve their win conditions.  Looking forward to tackling the bots and playing a full 4-human player game and may update my comments/rating then.

The rules on this are by far the most daunting of any COIN game. Much more so than FitL. The thing is that it actually starts to click relatively easily. About half way through things fall into place that you may have missed earlier. One or two plays and you should have it down fairly pat.  

Please look ahead at the epoch before playing. Do not assume to learn the rules for it when it comes up. We made costly mistakes due to this.

Look forward to playing this many more times. The COIN series continues to amaze and reward.

Oooooh boy... This is (finally) the game that tops "Cuba Libre" as the best in the COIN series. A little more complex, a little more nuanced, a little more innovative, it has also a little more sense of pacing... In the end it isn't worth a full point rating over its predecessor, but between all COINs, this is the best.

I guess this is my type of game really – fairly heavy and involved, more strategy than tactics, very well themed, different approaches available and a long learning curve which means that each play should always provide some new understanding. However, it is not an easy game to learnn - mechanically the rules are reasonably straightforward albeit a little unclear in places but the main problem is that they leave you with no sense of how the game ‘feels’ and how the various actions fit together in order to have some idea of what you should do (as opposed to what you can do).

Thematic, original design with the goal of building green energy plants in order to reduce the CO2 levels in the atmosphere.

This is definitely a gamer's game with alot of moving parts.  On your turn you choose ONE of the following actions: propose a plant (this option is always available and although it is weak, it is a necessary first step in order to build a plant and sometimes it's all you can do), install a plant (relatively cheap/easy to do, gives better payouts, and is the necessary second step in the plant building process), or construct a plant (this is the most expensive and difficult step but it is the most lucrative one as it scores you points and gives you potential area influence which come with perks).  You also have 3 possible "free" turns you can take: 1) add or move a scientist- scientists give you accumulating expertise in an energy field and can generate you some minor income, and they can be moved onto proposals or installations or to summits which are investments for significant expertise increases 2) play a card- you start with a hand of 5 simple cards which can be played to enhance a particular action, OR you can play a UN card which are another key way to score points (however you need the ever scarce tech cubes and you need to have already built key power plants), 3) perform a market action- there is a market of carbon emission credits (CEPS) that can be purchased for use or sold for income.

There are essentially 3 streams of income in the game: money, which is crucial for power plant building, technology cubes, which are crucial for power plant building, UN card playing, and which pay out a minor 3 point bonus at end game potentially, and CEPs which are essential for installing projects and which can be a lucrative income source if played at the right time.  Movement on the critical expertise tracks occur at the end of every turn that you have a scientist placed on a project.  The expertise tracks are important for several reasons (there is one for each type of energy): first and second place score income at the end of each round (money and/or points so this can be significant for scoring), you need a bare minimum of expertise in order to construct an energy plant, and small but important bonuses are immediately paid out at certain levels on each track.

The game has several different end conditions: 1) everyone LOSES if the CO2 levels get too high, 2) winner with most points after 5 rounds, 3) winner with most points after CO2 levels are reduced below a certain level, 4) winner with most points if 2 geographical regions are fully built up with green energy plants.

The rules are very dense first time through but gameplay is actually relatively easy and intuitive after a first play.  The mechanisms work smoothly, the theme is original and definitely "fits", and the scalability is excellent.  The components are solid, the artwork is muted but appropriate.  This is just the second design by Vital Lacerda (first game was the impressive Vinhos), and this is probably my favourite game of this year (2012).  Nice to see a designer filling the void of original, quality gamer's games.

The new Busen Memo.  It's the game where you can talk "about" the game, but you can't actually talk _about_ the game.  The hilarity that is political correctness comes home, as the masters of the community cry for "theme" in a sea of boring rehash, then does everything in their power to suppress any sort of real dialog about what the game means.  

Someday, people will come to realize that "getting along" isn't always the best or most productive option.  Until then, they'll wonder why the conversations (and themes) in their entertainment is so mundane.

I have to say I am shocked how much I enjoyed this one. I was intrigued by the artistic design, but I was very impressed with the mechanical weaving of play. It has layers and lines of scoring that require very careful planing. It is terribly easy (it seems) to be one resource or one dollar out of sorts - a sampling of the balance this game has achieved. I really enjoy the theme too as it is completely built into the design. I do feel the starting cards can be harshly unfair and it is a challenge to teach, but beyond that, definitely one I wish to play several more times.

Another win from Vital Lacerda.  I love the 'controversial' theme and the art to this one.  

The very limited semi-cooperative nature of the game (i.e., only work together to the extent necessary to ensure that the world is not destroyed) actually tends to make for some really interesting mid-game decisions.  

I'm interested to see what changes are made in the second edition of this game.

Well-made and beautiful game...but it's just not my thing.  Too heavy for me.  Too many rules and not enough progression in the game; never felt I was building towards something.  That, and I have a problem with games where the final scoring adds SO many more points than you've accumulated during the game.  It doesn't give a very good sense for relative positions.

The game was good, lots of variability in setup and a very neat interplay of research, planning and building.  You can take other people's projects and attend conferences.  I liked it and will happily play it again.

I rated a 7 though, because it's heavy enough that I won't want to play it 10 times a year.  There's a ton of meat to this game, and I was tired after I played it.  Not a bad thing at all, just reduces how eagerly I want to play it again a little bit.

The problem in this game is the late third. While it seems that it is effective to propose or install certain projects, thus gaining control about WHAT will be built, it still seems counter-intuitive to allow the other players to build power plants, which generate victory points.

It lead to some kind of stalemate in our game, which was not nice to experience...

Very interesting medium (to heavy?) Euro with plenty of strategy. I like the way the theme is integrated into gameplay and the fact that the game deals with a topic that's really important in real life makes it quite thought provoking. I quite like the artwork on the board and find the design and layout very functional. The components are nothing to write home about. Comes with a single-player option.

Nice looking eurogame. The game establishes its theme quite well and it also has a minor cooperative element. The whole thing looks complicated at first but actually it is simple. There are only 3 main actions. You either start working on a project, or you finish a previousy started project, or you build a power plant (something that requires a finished project). There are also a small number of free actions that you can take like moving scientists, or trading at the market. Interaction is high because everyone can use anything on the board. Its very common for a player to start and later finish a project, only to see an opponent build the power plant. Players are also competing for some face up goals. Great production values. 
Gameplay gets a bit repetitive after some rounds. I am not convinced that the minor cooperative element truly offers something to the game.

CO2 is a good game with a lot of nice decisions to make. My first impression is that there's a clear strategy to win, but I was wrong. It's a heavy euro which requires experience in order to win. The game is nicely balanced and there's a nice build-up of tension towards the end. I will play it again with every possible occasion.

Wow, after one play of CO2, it is very hard to figure out exactly what to think of this gaming experience. Lots to discuss with this game, and for that reason alone, it should definitely be played at least once by every serious BGG gamer. Let me start...

I played with five players last night, four newbies (including myself), and one player teaching the game after one play.

When the board was placed in the middle of the table, the chits placed in their stacks, and the cards dealt, I had serious doubts about the seeming dystopic aesthetics of the game. (Curiously, the aesthetics reminded me of the old Urban Systems games from the early 70's, and I admit, I did find that quite interesting.) Was I going to look at these graphics for several hours? Really? Simply put, they were not immediately attractive to me. (Where were the cute, cartoon european village graphics I am so accustomed to?)

But, on further reflection, I decided that, look, this was a "power plant themed" game, and let's face it, Power Grid, another fine "power plant themed" game, has the distinction of being a game with a VERY unusual aesthetic. With Power Grid once you decide to make peace with the (spartan-euro-minimalistic?) aesthetic, you find that the unusual aesthetic actually enhances the gaming experience. You enter the world of Power Grid.

The same is true of C02. Its aesthetic is highly atmospheric with a very artistic ambivalence conveyed, sometimes subtly, typically more overtly, towards power plants and CO2, as with the skulls all over the cards and board in this game. Okay, lots of skulls to look at when considering CO2 allowances...scary?....serious stuff?....interesting.

Now, to the game play...

My first play was a strange and not entirely comforting experience. But thinking back on the game, I can see how the game play would have been much better if the game had been explained differently. Interestingly, with this game, the explanation REALLY matters.

In particular, had the explanation been emphatic about ALL the ways to earn VP's in the game, and placed equal weight on all of them, with an explicit warning that you should NOT assume that the best way to earn VP's is to BUILD power plants, that would have made a substantial difference in the enjoyment of the game for me. Why?

Well, without that emphatic emphasis and warning, I had an unfortunate tendency to default into assuming that the best way to earn VP's was to build power plants. Wrong. Or, more accurately, no, not necessarily.

I think a fair number of first time players are going to play this game with four or five players, and get frustrated by the three step process wherein you propose to build a power plant (that you secretly want to build), only to have someone else build it before your next turn comes up, creating a feeling frustration. But that feeling is a bit misplaced since the final "build" action is just one way to earn VP's.

Notably, each step in the three step process is a valid way to earn VP's in OTHER, non-building directions. So, the goal is not entirely to be the person who completes the building process! The designer, like a good euro game designer, ensured that there are multiple paths to victory. Duh. So, try to enjoy the other ways.

Keep in mind that money, in particular income at the beginning of every decade, can be converted into VP's. As in Princes of Florence, you can either take your income in money, or VP's. The practical result of this fact is that you should definitely take actions in this game that boost you on the expertise tracks. And building power plants is NOT necessarily the best way to do that. Think about a scientist route.

In addition, pay attention to the fact that carbon permits are sold back at the end of the game, for money, which are then translated into VP's at $2 per VP. Thus, watch the market mechanism in the game, and earn VP's by manipulating it. And pay attention to the "UN" VP cards, and your secret VP goal cards.

Bottom line: first timers probably should proabably be told up front NOT to fixate on the final build action...or you will be frustrated by the game...as I admittedly was on my first play. Again, the goal of the game is to find ways to earn victory points, not necessarily finding ways to always build power plants on your turn.

Finally, the theme of the game, and the theme of each action, needs to be explained MUCH better to first timers. If it is not explained with care, first timers are left looking at a collection of seemingly very counter-intuitive mechanics. (Lots of tile flipping, beyond even Brass levels.)

Interestingly, again, the enjoyment of this game, I believe, greatly depends upon the explanation of the game. Along those lines, the player aides that ship with the game (and perhaps even the rules which I did not read, since the game was explained to me) describe the second stage of the power plant process as an "Install." I agree with others who have commented on this terminology problem. This term does not make sense to me as the second action. I am installing the power plant? Before I construct it? What?

So, I do believe that this second term should to be changed on the player aides in future editions. Because you must provide a carbon permit at this stage, I think this second stage might best be described as: "Preparation and Permitting." Just that small change in the explanation of the game would have improved the CO2 gaming experience for me.

I also wonder about the ideal number of players in this game. Perhaps it would play better with fewer players. Five players took a bit too long, and the state of the board changed dramatically by the time it came back to you on your turn. Even Dominant Species, to me, really suffers when you play with five. I will bet that the sweet spot for this game is 3 or 4 players.

In the final analysis, though, virtually everyone who played CO2 last night came away liking it, primarily I think, because the game presented some interesting complex gaming challenges. But also, I think, the players liked the social experience of talking about the state of play on the board.

This game is also receiving some attention for its semi-cooperative elements wherein, unless the players cooperate (at least in part) to keep world CO2 levels below a certain level, everyone loses the game. In our game, this element of the game occupied about 10-20% of our thoughts, and we fairly skillfully and straightforwardly cooperated to resolve this threat within the first 2 rounds (although, curiously, we did discover that one of the players did not want to cooperate to help us all have a chance, which was interesting). Once we had solved this crisis, we went on to play very straightforwardly and competitively. It was my sense (granted after only one play) that the designer did an excellent job with this aspect of the game. He produced exactly the right amount of focus on this creative design idea to produce a memorable experience.

This is a game that has considerable artistic vision, and even controversy, and I believe that is a great thing for gaming in general. We need more games like this to broaden the appeal of gaming to a wider audience, and make games, quite frankly, more relevant.

Perhaps games will someday be as culturally and artistically relevant and "culture-moving" as movies are today. I do find it interesting that the designer of this game, Lacerda, released his own amusing "movie trailer" for CO2. Right on.

I consider this game to be an excellent second work by Lacerda, (after Vinhos) but I feel that his best work is yet to come. He and the artists who worked on this game should keep aspiring to produce such good work.

Completely uninteresting and unengaging. We played the game once and were completely put off by it. Two-and-a-half years later we gave it another try and felt the same way again.

As a result, we traded it away for something we'd actually enjoy playing.

One play with 4 players.  Interesting mechanics with the market, but ultimately it is a very abstract game and the tech tracks  seem like they are just pasted on to give bonuses that don't necessarily correlate with anything related to the actual types of renewable energy.

The market mechanism is similar to other items where resource costs adjust based on supply (e.g. Glen More).  However in this game I thought it was unnecessarily abstract.  Sure, prices fall up/down, but why do you add exactly two discs to the supply when it goes up in price?  I would have preferred a more elegant approach, but maybe it just isn't possible to model this in a board game and keep it fun. 

Also, they really need to figure better nomenclature and wording for the instructions.  It does not make intuitive sense to have "Propose", "Install", and "Construct" as the actions you can take.  More realistic would be to substitute "Design" instead of "Install".  This actually caused a lot of problems and we ended up calling it "Wrench".

Based on the fact that all of the plants differ greatly (for example solar plants give you three tech cubes and recycling giving money), I would be concerned that the game may progress into a state where it is "Solved" and there is a single clear direction to take.

Beautiful game and great theme. Played once with two players. Our game ended too soon because i build a green plant right after co2 emissions went over 350, bringing it below 350 and thus ending the game. Planet won, i lost. Liked the game though, many choices to be made. Advancing tech seems to be the key to victory.

RATING: 8
Updated from a prototype rating of 6.5 to a final game rating of 8. 

In some ways, reminds me of Vinhos. The rules are a bit clunky sometimes, for the sake of theme, which I'm not sure I like. It also has many ways of scoring points, but I'm not sure if it has multiple paths to victory.

The developer/producer shot his foot with the manual, a more thorough manual with more visual examples would be far more useful than a manual in a dozen of different languages (I mean seriously, are there many Italians or French that don't speak english playing a game this heavy?). It makes the game much harder to learn, which doesn't help anyone. The player aid, on the other hand, is great. The components are ok, with some some poor coloring choices eg. the cards back.

The theme is new, which is laudable, particularly in this ocean of bland and unoriginal eurogames that keep flooding the market during the last years. It seems that it created a childish war of ratings around here, some people really need more hobbies, I guess.

The semi-coop factor is beautifully implemented. I like the way the game has a narrative of first having the players being forced to cooperate in order to survive and THEN focusing on winning. 
I also enjoy how the game is essentially one of managing three phases of a construction, and where you keep jumping from project to project in order to get the bonus that is more important to you (and these bonuses depend on the phase you get the project at, sometimes you want to actually construct the power plant, sometimes you only want to draw the blueprint for it).

The game is basically worker placement with a few twists. The match between theme and mechanics may seem slightly forced at first, but in the end it actually works rather well. It plays very fluidly with little downtime (unless ap induced...), and there's a certain amount of interaction between the players, mostly competition for objectives and some limited opportunities, but otherwise it's essentially resource management (actions, money, research points, pollution points), with typical snowball effect as the game progresses. It features a couple of neat mechanics and a rather well implemented trade off system between VP points and money, and it's usually a close game to the end.

All in all, a tight, neat, easily learned, nicely balanced game.

RATING: 6
I'm torn on this one. Lots of good ideas, a great theme for a "serious" board game, somewhat fast pace. I like the idea of the three-phased projects and the constant fear of a premature game ending due to the players being to slow with actually trying to reduce the CO2 levels. The mechanics worked nicely together (most of them anyway) and it did seem to be balanced.

Still, the game lacked one thing: fun. For the most part, I blame the graphics for that. They are bleak, uninviting and confusing. If I have to save the planet, at least make it look worth saving! Also, some mechanics caused the dreaded "you cannot do that" moments a bit too often.

Anyway, give this a try. It's not just a game, it's an important message. (and not a political one, what the hell, this is scientific fact!)

IMHO, the best of Lacerda's designs. The theme is unique and it's implementation is amazing. Three steps to build a factory bring the game a well deserved tension and many strategic decisions on the best timing. Trying to manage your resources or mess with the plans of your opponents may set your brain on fire, but it's well worth it. And it's semi-cooperative, so you have to work a bit together not to destroy the world. Amazing!
The solo variant is a nice puzzle to solve, as well.

A pretty nice balanced euro that seems to have sustained a lot of playtesting. I was not excited but I respect it as a game. Not bad. I'd prefer endeavor over it.

What I didn't find perfect:
some actions are not interesting towards the endgame (point made by tavlas)
there are no "broken" strategies, as in the room for developing/optimizing a specific strategy - game is a bit more opportunistic than I'd like - I think.
the events are dull
I did not feel the pollution level threatening me much.
I'd like more character to the specific energy sources

Excellent colour choice, kudos graphic designer!

The second game from portuguese designer Vital Lacerda is another deep gamer's game.
The rules are definitely more accessible than those in Vinhos, but the rulebook presents them in a less-than-optimal way, and this I fear, is due to the publisher: Giochix has yet to publish a game where the rulebook is smooth and elegant (but, I must add, everything you need is in there).
The game has a (minor) cooperative element, with the players trying to avoid over pollution (causing common defeat), while competing to build non-fossile power plants and gain the most victory points.
The game lasts 5 (or 6, with five players) decades/rounds, with each decade divided in a variable number of player turns (from 2 to 5, with five to two players).
Each turn a player can do only one of three actions (propose a project, install a project, build a plant), with some additional free actions. Everything is quite simple when you get used to it, even if the way the CEP market is a bit on the brain burning side (but it is perfectly logical simulation, so it works and can be handled... with the use of the player aid!).
The components are great, and the board is awesome from an artistic standpoint, while it is not the state-of-the-art in presenting the info (again, everything is there, but some more clarity wouldn't have hurt).
The game is very good, even if a bit long and exhausting: initial tentative rating is 7, but it could very well go up is after a couple of plays the "fatigue" of playing vanishes (when everything starts to work in a more automatic way in my brain)...

Preliminary rating based on one solitaire play, will likely move up (already has!)

I love that the game supports solitaire play, and it would seem to scale well up to 4 (not sure about 5).  The theme is well integrated and well chosen in my opinion.  The graphic design is fantastic, some of the best I have seen in any boardgame, but readability is an issue with some of the tiles.  

Cons:  the first few games are going to be rough teaching, there are a lot of interlocking pieces here and a fair bit of abstraction.  Early plays with rules will likely take every bit of 2.5 hours, but hopefully this will come down to less than 2 hours with experience.

Playing the solitaire game helps to understand the rules/flow of the game

Very beautiful game, great theme, but I found it too hard to teach and not getting played enough.  Sold

A game where you can be usurped at any moment, where your plans can be taken over by players who have less morals than you... I kid! It's a really interesting game of planning and building capacity and meeting demands, but unlike many many other games, you don't technically own what you build. Someone else can finish what you start and claim the bonuses for doing so. As you get resources at each point, it balances out through good play but the psychological impact of someone 'snatching' up one of your plans takes a little getting used to.

A beautiful, unusual and moderately complex game with simple actions - Vital Lacerda's trademark style.

Essen 2012: First (half) play. For the first time ever I am tempted to not record a play for this and I cannot rate this game after one play. 

Played at Epsom Games Club we had 3 tables playing simultaneously where no one had played before. So we had a mass learning tutorial where I tried as best I could to explain the game from my 2 reads of the rules. Then as the games started we buzzed each others tables for second opinions and clarifications.

Our game had 4 players and the going was slow. Each turn seemed to uncover something that needed a rules check. The game is not suited for those who tend toward AP. Downtime can be considerable.

Despite emphasising that only set power types can be built on a continent we got this wrong on three occassions and with half the game complete after 2 hours 30 mins play we decided to wrap it up.

Some of the iconography on the cards isn't consistant  and the card manifest is required to check which variation the designer picked this time around

There does seem to be the whiff of a good game in there with the possibility for some screwage and deep strategy and I am keen to play again (not that I think I've actually played this yet) but would only wish to do that with 3 players to try to speed things up.

Second Play: By this time I had digested the rules and completed a player aid that had been vetted by the designer. Surely now I was ready? This outing was with three new but experienced players and the rule explanation went well-ish. With the best will in the world people make mistakes and unless you dedicate your down time to checking everything that goes on this is inevitable in a game with fiddly rules and so many what-ifs to consider.

More rules came to the surface that I'd missed, the one about needing a position on the expertise track that equalled the number of tech cubes on the prospective plant tile before you can buy it. I'd just thought you had to pass the crane icon. There was alot of back tracking and reassessment, and this was with good players.

So I'm left in a quandry. This is a game that would and should fly with players who have played it 2 or more times. However playing with first timers really has to be written off as a learning experience and as most games and groups I play with involve the inclusion of a new comer to the game on the table, I think this would soon become a pain in the arse.

Its a clever game but maybe just too fiddly.

Ah, the good old USA, where scientific fact, logic and reason go to die. Novel theme, done by a rising star of design. How much more auto-buy can you get?

Edit: Yup, it is really good. Packed with meaningful decisions, many opportunities/paths to score, lots of opportunities that must be left for opponents. Now, the only question is, will I like this more than Vinhos?

The feel of this game is great.  That said, I can't quite describe what it feels like or what itch it scratches.  Every time I play the game, I do feel like a corporation  that is trying to compete in the industry while preserving the environment. It does feel quite competitive.   It does not feel like a cooperative game, so if anyone doesn't like corporate games, they should not discount C02.

I nearly didn't buy this because the theme is definitely not to my taste! However, I am so glab I tried it. It can look a bit heavy at first and there are quite a few things to remember to do. You soon get used to it and the player aids really help out with remembering what to do.

Yes, the semi co-op thing is something that I didn't like the sound of either. However, it's not a problem for me as we agree that we will try not to throw the game.

Eye-catching visuals too, I love the board.

I really like how you are competing in developing your expertise, trying to be ahead in various tracks.

Played once.  First game took for ev er.  Going through the rules was a chore and was really irritated at some very unclear rules (scientist placement and useage).  Also, inconsisten terminology and usage of a numbering system for the rules but no table of contents?  

And what the hell with the scoring track?  Goes up to 50 only and all three of us were over 200?

The game could use a FAQ (which there might be one).

With that said, I still liked it. Liked it enough to where I would rate it a solid 7. It felt thematic for the most part and it's a type of euro I dig. I am certain that the game will move along well after a second play sooner, than later.  The turns aren't really that long, either.  

I guess my irritation is just that.  Irritation.  
 
One other note...the chance of everyone losing this game would have pissed me off after spending 4+ hours and it was close to ending.  One person was sort of trying to push for it.  I did not invest that type of time into the game to just have it end.  I *dislike* that part, immensely.  

Second play went better.  Had to go through the rules again but this time I had a faq and it went smoother (only two of us).  I boosted my rating up to an 8.  I really dig this game.

This game is on a refreshing subject, looks amazing and has some interesting mechanics (there is a necessary element of working together in the early game). But it plays too long for its depth (not as deep as I was hoping), and the end game is awful - too long definitely, but essentially its a question of trying to maximise VP gain from a limited number of choices before your opponent does the same. In the end a big disappointment in a game I had high hopes for.

I've now played this 4 times (1 solo, 2 2-players, and one 4-player).  The solo game is yuck.  The 2-player game is bland and the 4-player game is fun.  In essence, it's a game about proposing projects (and getting stuff), installing projects (and getting stuff), and building projects (and spending stuff for VPs).  In order to build projects, you have to have advanced on tech tracks and end of rounds income is given to the leaders of the 5 tech tracks.  In addition, you can install and build projects other people have started.  Lastly, you can control regions which give you access to their CEPs (one type of stuff).  It's not a bad game and with more players, there's enough different things to keep track of that it's interesting.  I don't think it's one I'll ask to play often, but I'm happy enough to play it if someone else wants to.  It's possibly my current rating (7) will go up with more plays.

At the end of the day, it's dry and mechanical. Sold after 2 games. Not keen on revisiting it.

Following Vinhos, this author seems to like to pile on the rules. I'm not so sure that this results in "deep" games. The depth seems to come from spending a lot of time learning how to play and making sure you've got every micro-rule correct.

A wonderful surprise. I'm normally not into Euros with totally schematic boards (in this case, just a series of scoring and tech tracks), but I found this to be an incredibly thematic game that drew me in from the very first turn. 

The CEP market nicely simulated cap-and-trade policies, the different plant costs and benefits made perfect sense thematically (reforestation plants grant more CEPs, solar plants produce technology, biomass and recycling generate money), and the lobby cards shaped player decisions in ways that mirrored environmental politics. I cannot attest to the scientific accuracy of the game (apparently the CO2 scale is way off, and some of the technologies are unrealistic), but the semi-coop aspect made for some interesting player dynamics: those in last place could strongarm the leaders into taking the brunt of the responsibility for the group. A truly thematic and thought-provoking game.

I just don't think semi-cooperative games work in general. I don't see what it adds to the game either. I think just penalizing players for not contributing to the common goal is enough to encourage the desired behavior. Here, it can actually make sense to tank the game and pollute. How does that make sense? 

On top of that, the theme does not shine through here for me like in his other games. It just feels like generic resource conversion, and not participating in an actual energy market at all.

I love Kanban and Vinhos from the same designer (have rated them 8+), so I had very high expectations for this game. It sounded intriguing due to the semi-coop nature; a feature that I haven’t really found to be a successful mechanic in any game. And this was no different to be honest… 

I didn’t enjoy the game at all - and no, it wasn’t because I got destroyed, I actually won the game. But the game lacks in a lot of areas in my opinion. First of all, the so-called “semi-coop” isn’t really that much of an issue. In our first game, the pollution track rapidly increased, but once we started building a couple of plants, it wasn’t an issue any more as no new plants are then added for that round. We were constantly able to hold off the KO, and we did so without too much trouble and without really going for it.

The game also seems to lack different strategies. The game is about building power plants, so everybody does so. But the other source of points (and income) comes from the experience track, which was a neat idea, but quickly began to fade as I realized that some people could get royally screwed by the track… If you’re not first or second, you don’t get points/income and are basically out of the game (which can also be seen by the scores in our first game)! That’s honestly a terrible mechanic in my opinion. 2½ hours can take a long time if you’re out of contention after 1 hour…

Also, the game seemed to have some sort of chicken element; it seemed a wise move if you could wait to do your action and piggyback of what other players did, i.e. if they proposed a project or flipped it, you could build a power plant. Also, I hated when the scientists were removed if another player flipped the tile… You got a tiny, cosmetic compensation, but it didn’t feel “enough”. So, as you’re only able to do one action on your turn, and then have to wait for the turn to come around again, other players can easily “steal” your move and build a power plant etc., and that was a mechanism I didn’t enjoy.

Finally, the 5 rounds all feel more or less the same. I could do almost the same in the 3rd turn of the 5th round as I could on the 3rd turn of the 1st round, and while there are some games in which it doesn’t bother me due to other mechanics (CoB comes to mind), I hate it in most game, this one included. Oh, and the bonus cards did seem somewhat imbalanced; some were much, much harder to complete.

There are obviously also some cool features in the game; the market mechanic of buying discs from the middle of the table, the completion of the UN cards, the scientist conferences etc. But overall I didn’t like the game as it was too repetitive and restrictive.

What a clever, heavy Euro! This game is very impressive with its theme and gameplay. It does the semi-coop style game proud by not allowing one player to ruin the game. All the decisions make sense and allow for lots of ways to interact with other players without directly engaging them. The game does run long and has an awful rulebook, which is really a bummer because I want to like this game more but its difficult to get out and play because the mix of heavy euro and choppy rulebook. It still is a beautiful game that deserves play.

Ugh. 

I was looking forward to trying this game based on the theme and the concept of players having to mutually work together against a game system that forced an ending and loss for everyone.

Then I read the rules, which left me slightly baffled and uninspired. I like to think I can handle some meatier games, but the rules struck me as obtuse.

...and then I played the game. Blah. It's just not very fun. Players are working to propose projects, install projects, build and complete projects for points, but it just felt like a bland exercise. 

Maybe I'd play this again if someone was very enthusiastic, but for me personally, I can turn my attention to equally heavy games that I actually enjoy.

An amazing design.

The fact that nobody owns a plant until it is built adds a very interesting shred incentive dynamic to the game.  I am also just starting to wrap my head around the subtleties of proposing and sitting on projects just for the expertise and to block high-demand proposal slots.  This is another of the latest crop of hybrid euros that I have found so engaging.

The game has quickly rose to the tops of my ratings.  So far, no two games have played out the same way.  Some games have seen depressed CEP markets the entire game, others have seen UN cards play no role in the victory.

The only down-sides thus far has been the neutered threat of the pollution track (it has never been an issue worth paying attention to as of yet) and that sometimes the combinations of hidden objective can kind of gum up the works (for us, It has been the CEP in hand hidden objective).  Other than those quibbles, and they should be considered minor, this game is a masterpiece.

This game never registered as a large blip on my gaming radar: cause were raw memories of the author's previous game Vinhos which I considered to be too much complexity for complexity's sake. But when the opportunity presented itself for me to give CO2 a go, I decided not to pass it up.

Although there are fewer obvious knobs and dials in this game compared to Vinhos, there is still a considerable number of them. They don't look like regular knobs and dials so in that you soon have a 'wow!'-feeling of everything being fresh and novel... but they are knobs and dials just the same. In order to build a power plant to prevent a polluting one to make its appearance, you have to jump through various hoops and interact with numerous subsystems in the game. Although I initially had little problems with it, in the post mortem I became uncomfortably aware of the fact that you couldn't really act any differently than what the game prescribed, making it all very artificial and game-y even though it is subjectwise all correct. Neither does it seem possible to specialise in one aspect at the cost of staying behind in another: yes, there is differentiation with respect to the level of power plant you can build, but apart from a different symbol that has you aiming for different UN cards and perhaps using different lobby cards in the route to getting them on the board they are all alike. And other players do just the same with slightly different plants. All in all CO2 seemed more to be an elaborate simulation of the CO2-issue rather than a game... I'm willing to be corrected on this but to be honest I'm not keeping my hopes up. 

A third issue (after the hidden subsystems and not-quite-a-game feeling) is with the 500 ppm-everybody-loses rule. It appears very difficult to play to lose, and requires quite determined and obvious blocking of important resource areas so that new power plants cannot easily enter the game. I don't think this rule was meant to be an actual goal, to be honest; it just serves as a cattle prod for the players not to dally too much. Frankly, I don't like such everybody-loses rules unless the game is a coop. If you dislike the (your!) game so much that you are willing to sink it for everyone, you deserve a smack on the behind. In any case, I think the [i]game[/i] would have been more interesting had this restriction be re-cast into a sudden death [i]victory[/i] condition comparable to what happens in old Liberté. Granted, the game is then no longer about saving the world, and introduces Evil Climate Sceptics who take a deep breath of CO2-enriched air, proclaim all is well, and complain that the insurance companies are trying to screw them because all these 'extreme weather events' are nothing out of the ordinary. There is no such think in CO2... but it would have been fun, I think.

To sum it all up: while CO2 presents itself as a nice challenge with mechanisms you will not readily find in other games, I'm harbouring strong doubts as to the game's long term replayability. In that the author has, for the moment, unfortunately shown himself to be more of a creator of systems of bells and whistles rather than worthwhile games hich keep you coming back for more.

This game is very much what I'd hoped it would be: the fairly straightforward choices of "what do I want to accomplish this turn?" complicated by the effects of those choices on other players' options.

5-player seems pretty brutal on the pollution front. This is another one of those games, like Archipelago, which asks you the question, "how much are you willing to sacrifice your own plans to prevent a group loss?", and I suspect tables which find that question problematic in Archipelago are also going to have a hard time of it here.

Very interesting game about building power plants without destroying the Earth.

Neat game, cool mechanics. The artwork and iconography, while good, feel unusually abstract for me for some reason (and I'm usually pretty good with iconography on other games like Race for the Galaxy, Dungeon Lords, etc). It's an interesting game, but the amount of maintenance through turns with all the tracks and stuff make it seem a little mathematically stale and a little fiddly (for me at least). I feel like I would rate this game higher if I was playing it on an ipad which kept track of all these for us, because it's caused problems on more than one occasion (including a completely abandoned game halfway through).

RATING: 7.6
The individual scorings are only possible once and if the commun objectif is secured, what is really a nice concept, forcing players to cooperate in the early stages of the game. The mechanics of the game are very well suited with the theme and the general game design is also very appealing. The game is not so heavy and complex as it seems, though there are lots of small tricky rules that keep beeing forgotten all the time.
Nevertheless, there are a few (rough) edges that could and should have been avoided before the game`s release: There is no point in installing a plant (even considering the rewards) as others players can then build it and take the correspondent points (this has later been fixed through a rule´s correction), the 2nd place rule at scientist tracks (when there is more than one first position) is illogical and the scoring system makes little sense, as it can give more points to the bonus features, that is, from speculating around the "core" mechanisms of the game, than from good use of those mechanisms themselves.

There are some interesting things going on in CO2. The different game mechanics mesh together pretty well. There are three major resources (money, technology and burn tokens) as well as 5 expertise tracks.

There is a three step process to fully implement a new-technology power plant. At each step, there are different costs and/or benefits. Different players may have their scientists working on different projects, but the projects themselves are owned by no-one and may be completed by anyone. This actually plays out pretty well.

However, the game is not particularly fun. I generally like games where things get built and there is a supply-and-demand marketplace. Even the semi-cooperative element of this game actually plays smoothly. But, it's a little boring. On a given turn, you might have 12 different choices... 6 of them won't be so great and the other 6 will probably all be about equal. Rarely is there a truly excellent move to discover. Maybe the game is just "too balanced", as I've heard said of some other games?

Disappointing, too, is that actions and planning are highly limited in the 5-player game, which is our normal player count. But we also played with just 2 and even then agreed that the only (mildly) exciting part was adding up the final scoring.

The rulebook and the theme are a bit preachy and biased. (For example, the game ignores hydroelectric power and nuclear fusion power... and then treats all present-day power generation technologies as catastrophic greenhouse polluters.) I'm pretty moderate on the climate change issue and I dislike the extreme elements on both sides. That being said, the game's level of propaganda certainly isn't high enough to recommend against the game based solely on that.

CO² was één van de spellen waar ik zonder twijfel het meeste van had verwacht voor de beurs in Essen startte. Vooral het thema sprak me enorm aan. Het is dan ook erg jammer dat ik het spel tot op heden nog steeds niet op tafel heb kunnen brengen. Het feit dat dit spel helemaal aan het einde van onze Essen-spelbesprekingen staat gepland, verraadt het ook een beetje. Is het dan geen goed spel? Toch wel volgens mij, maar het feit dat de spelregels niet super geschreven zijn, gecombineerd met de moeilijke vaktermen die worden gebruikt, hebben ervoor gezorgd dat dit spel eerder op een zijspoor terecht is gekomen. Gelukkig verschijnen er stilaan enkele video's online met een duidelijke en gestructureerde speluitleg en dit maakt het allemaal toch een beetje makkelijker.  


CO² is een veelspelersspel, laat ons daar niet over zeuren. Er is héél wat gaande in dit spel en je zal hoogstwaarschijnlijk ook wel enkele beurten nodig hebben om het allemaal onder de knie te krijgen. In CO² probeer je samen met de andere spelers de aarde te behoeden van de ondergang. Een coöperatief spel dus??? Neen, niet echt, je kan wel met z'n allen tegen het verlies aanlopen, want als de aarde onleefbaar is geworden door onze overtollige uitstoot dan verliest iedereen. Maar in dit spel ga je gewoon kei hard voor een individuele overwinning. Elke speler krijgt een opdrachtkaart waarmee hij op het einde van het spel punten kan scoren en tijdens het spel liggen er enkele kleinere opdrachtkaarten voor het rapen. Er zal in ieder geval voor gevochten worden.


Afhankelijk van het aantal spelers verloopt het spel over 5 of 6 decennia. Deze bestaan op hun beurt uit een bevoorradingsfase en een aantal actieronden die ook afhangen van het aantal spelers. Het staat eigenlijk allemaal mooi aangegeven op het speelbord. Ook de rest van het materiaal is erg sfeervol, maar dit zorgt aanvankelijk toch ook voor wat onduidelijkheid. eens je de symbolen kent, blijkt het eigenlijk allemaal niet zo moeilijk en veel te zijn (maar dit is vaak het geval natuurlijk). Ik ga dan ook niet op alle kleine regeltjes ingaan, want dit zou het ogenschijnlijk moeilijker maken dan het allemaal is, dus bij deze een kort overzicht (u krijgt trouwens erg handige overzichtskaartjes bij het spel)


1) Inkomstenfase :
- verdeel inkomsten : de 1ste en 2de positie op de expertisesporen van de verschillende energiebronnen leveren geld en/of overwinningspunten op. De spelers kiezen hoeveel ze aan geld of punten willen ontvangen
- energievoorziening : de centrales in de werelddelen verbruiken energie, de uitstoot stijgt als er gebruik wordt gemaakt van kool, olie of gas. De speler die de regio controleert, dient hiervoor te betalen met een CEP (schijven die je tijdens het spel gebruikt als zijnde een soort betalingsmiddel om bepaalde zaken te mogen doen)
- gebeurtenis : indien de uitstoot bepaald niveaus haalt, volgt er een gebeurtenis. Trek een kaart, voer de gebeurtenis uit en leg de kaart af.


2) Actiefase : 
De speler heeft steeds de keuze tussen drie mogelijke acties. Daarnaast zijn er enkele gratis acties die elke ronde één maal uitgevoerd mogen worden.
- Een project voorstellen : stel de bouw van een bepaalde energiecentrale voor (die het werelddeel vraagt), ontvang hiervoor geld of grondstoffen of wetenschappers
- Installeer een project : betaal 1 CEP, ontvang het éénmalig effect van het project
- Bouw een project : betaal de kosten (geld en grondstoffen) en scoor de overwinningspunten (mag enkel indien je voldoende expertise in dat vakgebied hebt). Je wint ook extra expertise indien je deze actie uitvoert.


Gratis acties : mogen ten alle tijde tijdens je beurt uitgevoerd worden
- 1 wetenschapper inzetten of bewegen :
* op een project en overéénkomstig je expertise verhogen
* op een congres en je expertise eveneens verhogen
- de markt bezoeken : 1 CEP kopen of verkopen
- een kaart spelen : één van je lobbykaarten spelen en het voordeel ontvangen of één van de openliggende opdrachtkaarten vervullen en de punten scoren


3) Regio's controleren (geen aparte stap, geldt constant)
Als je een regio controleert, dit doe je door het meest gevraagde grondstoffen te leveren, mag je CEP's van die regio nemen, krijg je op het einde van het spel alle CEP's daar aanwezig, ben je verantwoordelijk voor de energievoorziening die de regio nodig heeft tijdens de inkomstenfase.


Het spel eindigt ofwel na vijf (zes) decennia OF als er twee regio's volledig volgebouwd zijn met alternatieve energiecentrales of wanneer de uitstoot terug zakt naar een veilig punt onder 350 ppm. Als de uitstoot boven de 500 ppm stijgt, is het spel ook afgelopen en verliest iedereen. 
Op het einde van het spel tel  je al je CEP's in je hand en die van regio's die je controleert, verkoop je deze tegen de huidige marktprijs en ontvang je het geld. Je scoort punten voor je opdrachtkaart, 1 punt voor elke 2 geld, 3 punten voor het meeste grondstoffen in handen en 3 punten voor de speler die het meeste opdrachtkaarten wist te scoren. De speler met de meeste punten wint het spel.

Only played twice so far - the first game with 4 players we mangled the CEP market rules so badly it seriously impacted on the game.

The second play with 5 players was more encouraging - we got the rules right for a start and I like what is going on. There are some cleverly interwoven mechanics and scoring mechanisms, and some fairly innovative ideas that make you think a bit differently to your normal action selection games.

I like the theme, which is pretty well realised, and the aesthetics are rather good but do suffer from a few functional glitches (e.g. not marking the power plant squares for decade).

However, I would say that 5 players is too many and that 4-player is probably only advisable with experienced players. There is just too much downtime between turns with 5 and it is hard to plan your turn when so much can happen between turns. This is almost inevitable with 'thinky' games.

The other criticism would be that there is quite a lot of fiddly admin - moving things up tracks paying cubes, returning scientists, adjusting CEP's, etc etc. Almost impossible to guarantee getting all of this right.

I suspect that when played with 3 I will udge my rating up to an 8.

UPDATE - two more plays (with 3 and 4 players) and both games were fun but long. Some additional thoughts:-

- There does seem to be a mid-game stall/deadlock where no one wants to install plants so that a following player can't build them. There are numerous threads about this in the forums so it is a common problem but the designer and experienced players suggest it is the result of players over-valuing the build action. I'm not completely convinced by this but only more plays would tell.

- The fiddly admin and subsequent actions (e.g. chained expertise moves) can result in players wanting/having to reverse moves out. Not allowing players to do this would simply result in too much AP.

- Even with experienced players I reckon this will run to 3 hours.

I actually like the lack of control in this game. Didn't bother me at all that some other player could build my stuff. There was always things to do not a problem for me. I also like the pseudo-cooperation needed to stop the game from "winning" in the first couple of turns.

After one game, I think this game has great potential.   My rating could go up as many as 3 points with repeated plays.  But could also drop by a point or 2.

My biggest concern is the "install" action.  It does not seem strong enough.  And when you use this action...which someone has to do...the next player can often construct where you installed.  So what we saw was a game of chicken where no one wanted to do the install, but everyone wanted to do the construct.  I didn't particularly like this element.

Also the "everyone lose" element is a strange one.  The game can reach a point, where this is a mathematical certainty that it will not occur.  I guess this is fine, but not sure I like the design choice.  I need to read the rules myself to make sure we didn't miss anything critical.

3 players game. I did terribly and lost the game with miles behind the 2nd and 1st position. 

I didn't know what I was doing in the beginning and by the time I realized and understood how everything went, it's already mid game and already too late to fix or catch up.

I felt it's a good game and has lots of layers and I just think it isn't my kind of game.

[b]After 2nd play (months after that):[/b]
I'm hooked! It was a 5 players game and I really like it with 5. I learned better and I like it more this time. Feels like there's a lot you wannna do, but got restricted by number of actions left. Cost is another thing to think about. Money, tech cubes, CEP, and expertise are hard to obtain therefore making everything a lot harder.

I need to play more to really see if I like the game.

After a couple of plays, It's prety noticable how the designer managed to create an almost perfect balance between Player vs Player and at the same time, working cooperatively to save the planet from a dystopian polluted future.

This game pretty stands out from your other typical zombie/trading in the mediterranean games that seems to get published every month or so.
The theme alone is very innovative and can also be inviting if you're the type of person that cares for the environment.

The board itself is also remarkable whereas you have what seems to be a water color art plasterd all over it it which gives it a cool look.
And of course the gameplay itself is very entertaining where you're on a race to gain points by constructing green power plants but at the same time, carefully planning your next moves and negotiating together with your other oppenents so you don't all lose the game to overpollution.

Overall this game is currently ranked 5 on my top board games list and I highly recommend it for players who are looking for an innovative game. Both in play and artwork.

Normally, I wouldn't pay much attention to a game that clearly has an agenda - in this case, CO2 is clearly focused on environmental issues and can be a bit heavy-handed in that department; however, the theme greatly compliments the gameplay, which is solidly crafted and engaging.  In other words, the agenda behind the game does not in any way impact it negatively.

That being said, I walked away from this thoroughly impressed by how tightly the game played out with all of the pieces of the puzzle interacting together wonderfully.  One of the aspects I really enjoyed was that all players have the same goal of making the world a greener place and this is reflected in the semi-co-operative nature of one of the end-game triggers; specifically, if the CO2 level gets out of hand, then everybody loses.  Against this, however, there is only room for individual victory and this puts a fine edge between group loss and individual glory.  Loved that!

Stripped of its theme, the game is essentially a resource-management, area-control game where owning the particular space on the map (in this case, continents), allows you to exploit it for more resources in which to achieve your goals.  Driven by a worker-placement-like mechanism, your goal is to develop and construct new sources of "clean" power in order to remove the old sources of "dirty" power.  Construct more than the other players around you and you'll have the game in your hands.  I said a few times in my playthrough that this is essentially the concept of SimCity power plant management abstracted to a global scale.

While the rules seem overbearing and intimidating, this is one of those cases where there is a lot to digest, but the game flows naturally after a turn or two.  With the limited amount of actions you can take, your choices, while still interesting, don't require a whole lot of AP.  Of course, this means that the game progresses at a decent clip and you will find yourself in the modern era faster than you think.

Like any other good Euro out there, you will never accomplish everything you want to do.  At the end of the game, you may feel a sense of satisfaction, knowing that you did the best you could with what you had, but never everything that you wanted.  Different strategies will make themselves apparent and encourage experimentation through multiple plays.

While it's not something I will introduce to my library any time soon, mostly because I'm generally not a fan of most Euros, it has enough going on that I would gladly play it again.  If CO2 managed to score this high for someone who decidedly doesn't like a whole lot of Euros, it's definitely worth checking out.

This is an excellent, heavy economic game with a great theme that shines through, and adds to the game mechanics.  Sending your scientists to summits to share knowledge is fun, and I love the competative-but-you-can-all-lose gameplay.  Some have complained about the fact that a player can spend actions developing a power plant for building, only to have another player end up building (and owning) that plant, but I don't think that's a problem if all are aware of the possibility ahead of time, and you realize that you've benefited from developing that site -- you got something for your actions.

The attraction here is the subtlety. At first glance, I thought (like many others) the game was about getting to the third step of the propose-flip-build process for building plants since building gives you VPs, however, the game is far subtler than that. Each of those steps has its advantages and since building costs money and money are 2:1 VPs plus cubes, you net much less than the face value of the plant. The income tracks are the key to your game. In fact, I would argue better play is using the non-build actions as much as possible for the benefits they confer and building as little as possible - let the others save the world while you collect more workers and stuff then build what you need where you need it. I just love that subtlety and completely own up to missing it my first time through.

Ignore those complaints about the game stalling as those people don’t understand the importance of getting up those tech tracks and that the game is not merely about building plants for VPs. Plants are the icing but your tech is the cake; if the game were called “Environmental Expertise” or something then people might get that’s where the focus needs to be. Your tech levels give you income that you can take as money or VPs, and trust me, it’s not always an obvious decision.

The game does a great job of pulling you in different directions between your secret goal card (an important focus of your efforts), your action cards (you only get 5 for the entire game), and the opportunities presented by other players at any moment. Yes, there are times when someone might jump your claim if you’re not careful, but you shouldn’t be focused on just building plants anyway. It is by far one of the more non-obvious games I’ve ever played and repeated play is necessary to see how to use your one (and only one) main action per turn as a fulcrum against the rest of the game. 

Now for the bad news. After 8 plays – and only some with the 100% correct rules – this game never took off for me the way I expected it to. Between the processes for building plants, moving bumped scientists, wrapping up conferences, and taking your end of turn tech, the game felt overly procedural and halting. People would forget to take the end-of-turn tech points and I’d have to stop planning my next move and help administer some process and end up playing Game Mother to keep it all straight. I couldn’t sink into a place of just playing the game and burned out on it.

I absolutely love the semi-cooperative nature of the game yet you still have to work and stategize to make sure that you take advantage of the shifting market price of the CEP's, your own company goal, the expertise track along with the summits, and trying to maintain control of the different continents. Still have yet to try the expansion (which I have).

I liked this game surprisingly well (coming from very low expectations). I thought it would be more complex than it was. Only 2-3 real options on your turn, which is convenient. The end game is also very exciting since a player may kill the game before the final round.
A couple of things, though: It's a little bit too easy to do something wrong (according to the rules) in this game, and it's hard to reverse when you discover the mistakes.
For a game of this length, the semi cooperative mechanism is  a little frustrating, since other players maybe too easily can destroy your plans (which you have made quite an effort to invest in).
All in all, a decent game.

Na sikerült ezt is kipróbálnunk nagy nehezen. Ez egy 5 személyes játék utáni vélemény.

Kinézet:
A doboz és a játék nekem nagyon tetszik. Sokan meghökkentek, hogy mennyire színtelen az egész, nomeg a prototípus azt hiszem zöldebb és élénkebb volt, mint a végleges, de szerintem ez a kinézet nagyon passzol a témához. Az egész kicsit olyan újrapapír kinézetű, pasztelles halvány színekkel. A kinézetnél meg kell azonban említeni, hogy a játékelemek nem sikerültek túl jól megkülönböztethetőre. Elengedhetetlen a játékhoz valami szortírozó alkalmatosság, zacskók vagy planobox. Ezen kívül a kártyák hátulja olyan jó pasztellesre sikerült, hogy a 4-5 féle kártyát gyakorlatilag képtelenség a hátlapja alapján szétválogatni, mert szinte teljesen egyformák. Szóval nem árt szereted pakolgatni szortírozni a játékot, mert különben hamar agybajt fogsz kapni.

A szabály:
A szabály kb. 10 oldal. A Tzolkinnál írtam, hogy nem kell megijedni a méretétől, na pont az ellenkezője az igaz. 10 oldal, de alig van ábra, ami miatt nagyon tömény az egész, és a példák hiánya miatt kicsit nehezen is érthető. Ritkán van ilyen, de nekem 3-szor kellett végigolvasnom az egészet, ami után még 1 órát fórumoztam, mire összeállt a kép nagyjából, de még így is követtünk el jócskán hibákat. A fő hiányossága szerintem az, hogy nem jön le belőle a játék pontos menete, csak gondolatok vannak egymás után, de nem áll össze az egész. Szóval kell kitartás a szabályhoz. Ezzel szemben a player aid nagyon jól sikerült és gyakorlatilag elengedhetetlen, nemcsak az első játékhoz, de valószínűleg még később is. Itt össze van foglalva egy kör, egy évtized, és a lehetséges akciók. Az is lehet, hogy szabályolvasás előtt ezzel érdemesebb inkább kezdeni.

A játék menete:
A játékban befektetőket alakítunk, akik megpróbálják ellátni a világot zöld energiával. A játék évtizedekre azokon belül pedig körökre van osztva. A körök száma függ a játékosok számától. Minél többen játszotok annál kevesebb cselekvés jut egy emberre a játékban. A játékosok a játék során erőműveket terveznek, készítenek elő és valósítanak meg. Az erőforrások a következők: pénz, technológiai erőforrás, tudósok, technológiai tudás, CO2 kvóta. A körödben egy akciót, és háromféle ingyenes akciót hajthatsz végre. Az akciód lehet erőmű tervezés, előkészítés vagy megvalósítás. Az ingyenes akciókkal tudóst mozgathatsz, kvótát vehetsz illetve kártyát játszhatsz ki. Így körről körre szaporodnak az erőmű-tervezetek és jó esetben az erőművek is. Jópofa (de először nehezen követhető) a játékban a kvótapiac működése. Gyakorlatilag minden esemény a piacról vesz el kvótát, de oda nem igazán megy vissza többet semmi, csak a bankba. Így egyre drágábban lehet CO2 kvótához jutni. Az egésznek van egy érdekes körforgása, amit nehéz leírni de játék közben érdekes megtapasztalni. Ezen felül még nagyon tetszett a technológiai tudás megszerzése. Ha egy adott típusú projekten dolgozik tudósod, akkor a kör végén tudást "termel" neked. De lehetőséged van mondjuk egy napenergiás erőművön dolgozó tudósodat elküldeni egy konferenciára is, ahol előadást tarthat a saját szakterületéből, illetve meghallgathat más játékosok által tartott előadásokat is, és ezzel természetesen tovább növeli a tudást a cégben. Természetesen plusz tudás jár az adott típusú erőmű felépítéséért is, azonban itt harap kicsit a saját farkába a kígyó, mivel valamennyi tudás kell ahhoz is, hogy fel tudd építeni. Az egész nagyon tematikus, és nagyon egyben van.
Nem akarom leírni a teljes szabályt, de még megemlíteném, hogy vannak a játékban lobby kártyák, amik valami egyszeri hasznot hoznak, adott feltételek teljesülése esetén, vannak UN célkártyák, amik pontot adnak bizonyos típusú erőművek felépítése esetén, illetve mindenkinek van egy titkos célkártyája, ami a játék végé ér, több kevesebb pontot. Ezen felül még meg kell említeni, hogy van egy területi többségszerző mechanizmus is, ugyanis, aki a legtöbbféle erőművet építi egy kontinensen, az gazdálkodhat a kontinens CO2 kvótájával, és költheti azt a sajátja helyett. Ezen felül a játék fontos részét képezik a "katasztrófák", amik nem is annyira katasztrófák a játék közben, ugyanis egy ilyen után adott kontinens komoly technológiai erőforrásokkal támogatja a zöld beruházásokat. Kulcsfontosságú, hogy ki tud először lecsapni ezekre.

A tematika:
Talán már a játékmenetes leírásból is érződött, hogy nagyon nagyon tematikus játékról van, ami ritka az eruogémek világában.

Interakció:
A játékban közepes interakció van. Közvetlenül nem tudsz keresztbe tenni a másiknak, de mivel a projektek gyakorlatilag közösek, így folyamatosan hatással vagytok a másik lépésire. Talán itt említeném meg, hogy van egy semi-cooperatív jellege is a játéknak, ugyanis ha a co2 szint elér egy kritikus határt, akkor minden játékos elveszti a játékot. Ha sikerül kordában tartani, csak akkor érdekes, hogy kinek hány pontja van.

Játékidő, játékosszám:
Na erre érdemes allokálni rendesen az első pár játéknál. Mi öten voltunk, mindenki újonc. Egyedül én olvastam a szabályt. Így mindennel együtt kb. 3,5 óra volt, de hozzá kell tenni, hogy nem jól játszottuk, mert már előbb teljesült volna az egyik játék vége feltétel. Én azt javaslom, hogy ne álljatok neki elsőre ennyien, inkább csak 3-an, talán úgy nem húzódik el annyira, mert előbb összeáll mindenkinek a játék menete. Érzésem szerint a játék nem is teljesen működik tökéletesen 5 fővel, inkább a max 4 javasolt. Meg kell említeni, hogy van pasziánsz mód is, de ezt még nem próbáltam, de agricola szerűen valami célt kell elérni, és kordában tartani a co2-t.

Újrajátszhatóság:
Nagyon összetett a játék, így nem tudom, hogy mennyire van szükség változó elemekre benne. Ami az újrajátszhatóság hatással lehet: UN célok, Zöld energiaigények, konferenciák, célkártyák, lobbykártyák véletlenszerűek. Így összeszedve úgy érzem, hogy nagy az újrajátszhatósági faktor.

Bonyolultság:
Nagyon brainburner játék. Még azt figyelembe véve, hogy a további partyk valószínűleg gördülékenyebben lesznek is azt mondom, hogy erre rá kell készülni, és nem fog senki kettőt játszani egymás után. Mi néha úgy éreztük, hogy mindjárt elered az orrunk vére a koncentrálástól.

Összegzés:
Egy szuper tematikus, nagyon összetett, egyértelműen gémer játék a co2, azokból is a nehezebb fajtából. Aki nem szereti fél óráig a szabályokat hallgatni, illetve herótja van a hosszabb brainburner daraboktól az kerülje el messzire. Akinek viszont van affinitása a dologhoz, annak szerintem tetszeni fog. Érdemes olyannal leülni, aki már játszott vele, mert a szabály keserves órákat fog okozni, illetve javaslom a 3-4 fős játékot.

RATING: 6
The game occupies roughly the same niche as Vinhos although after one game it seems to me the ratio of gameplay to sheer amount of mechanisms is a little higher here and with slightly better thematic integration which makes it a little easier to get it into your head. Nevertheless, it still feels a bit overloaded.

Player turns are usually fairly quick since they only consist of very few micro-actions although there is a fair bit of state management involved. Player interaction is rather subtle with timing considerations perhaps not playing the most obvious but the most important part. Players need to walk a fine line between proposing and developing new projects to acquire new resources and actually building power plants which is expensive but also a major VP source. That you can also take over other players' projects (for a small fee) just adds another layer to this dilemma.

Overall, the different parts in the game work quite nicely together, it feels interesting and balanced and it is quite possible that after a few plays the upkeep burden will retreat to the background. For now though, the overhead is a bit high.

Very interesting game. A bit of a time investment in terms of setting up and putting away, but it flows very well in the middle. This is an odd game where it starts out difficult, gets very difficult in the middle, then gets much easier by the end.

We've messed up the rules the first couple times we've played, but I look forward to playing this more, especially now that we have a better storage solution that makes setting up faster.

I've been looking for a semi-cooperative game for my collection, and this one (from the same designer of Vinhos) has caught my attention due to the beautiful components,  unique theme and mechanics - you have to propose projects, install and build (not just "pay gold and build" like most games) and your scientists gain expertise on different types of power plants, all players need to keep the global CO2 level low (otherwise everyone loses), but at the same time there are a competition for victory points, so there is only one winner, or no winner at all... a lot of things going on, can't wait to play this game. It can even be played solitaire, c'mon!

Very good game. Lots to think about in this one. Reading the rulebook one would think there is a very plodding, somewhat random game here but in reality it is tightly designed economic game - very challenging. There really is no game like this out there even though it has all the elements of games that have come before. But CO2 definitely does something different with area control and worker placement and it demands complete attention. Wonderful theme, too. Quite marvelous, actually. It's a shame the rulebook is such a turn off. This game is best learned from somebody else. Once past the rules, it is one of the most thought-provoking "heavy" games that I know.  Does suffer from some unavoidable fiddliness and lots of little rules, which is a shame.

An awesome game that manages to realistically convey the "semi-cooperative" nature of fighting global warming and the difficulty of aligning one's self-interest with common interest. I don't quite understand what the debate on BGG really is -- there just seems to be a lot of climate change deniers. If you're not one of them, it's hard to see why you wouldn't like this game.

Very interesting & refreshing theme- it marries well with the game play & mechanics but quite abstracted. Can be tense at the beginning while the group balances being competitive but not running up CO2 levels- but that goes away in midgame. Excellent board art. Not nearly as difficult to pick up as it seems, but it is complex for anyone but experienced gamers. Carbon/emission permits idea is fairly abstract and confusing. Some hate the idea that others can finish each other’s power plants.

It may be thematic but strategy feels somewhat tainted that other players can install your proposals.  Would prefer a completely competitive game where you have your own continent and you suffer from its CO2 and your own proposals,installs, and builds cannot be disrupted or stolen by other players.  Really like most other games by this designer but then again, they are all completely competitive.

Mediocre game. A bit too many sources of VP. Could do with less VP and more competition for existing VP. Some stall out over going from projects to installations. It was still an enjoyable experience but not sure it is a title I need to play again.

Played again and exact same response. Need to eliminate the multiple sources of VP, increase incentive to install projects, create a bit more interaction around projects going from proposal, installation, build. Don't need to play again but would if people wanted to.

This really did not click for us. I think co-ops and semi-co-ops are not our thing. But this game is all about picking the right time to swoop in and capitalize on openings your opponents have left you, and so felt either stagnant or frustrating. Neither are traits I look for in a game.

RATING: 7
It's wonderfully thematic and interactive, it almost doesn't even feel like a euro. I like the semi-cooperative nature of it, with everything from the universal loss condition to conferences being better with different players and being able to install and build other people's projects. It's both very thematic and impressive that even with these cooperative elements, the game is brutal and there's competition over everything. 

The game is not very complex, but it's rather unintuitive. Some of the rules that are thematic go against conventions of the genre, such as being able to push people off of projects and building them or being able to pay for things using the board's resources. Because of this, it can be hard to get going, especially since it requires so many steps before you can even build a power plant. It also has a lot of downtime, at least at higher player counts, because so much can happen between your turns and the game is rather tactical in nature, since you're constantly building off of other people. These 2 things are the only thing that's holding it down.

There have been few board games I've played where I have got so many rules wrong (or at least I assume I got rules wrong). The game play itself is not very difficult: Either propose, install, or construct a project and then take free actions. At the end of a decade, pay out players, check that energy requirements have been met, check the event region, and then move first player to the next person. 

And yet that doesn't begin to scratch the surface of who plays first in some situations, who triggers what, how far is ppm moved up on a decade-by-decade basis, what exactly happens at the end, and so on. Part of the problem here is that the designer has come out saying that the rules should be changed and those rules are not laid out in enough detail. Then you add to the fact that there are a TON of little rules you have to remember for certain situations and the iconography is damn near indecipherable and you have a real hot mess on your hands.

I love the theme, I love the look of the game, I love the idea behind the game play but CO2 is in need of some streamlining and a rulebook overhaul. That being said, I can't rate it because I feel we didn't play the rules right. 

Considering selling this one in the future.

Opinion: lot of things going on but not a point salad, you are focus on saving the planet with green energy power plants and everything you do is focused on that. Game with lot of interaction.
On your turn you only have 3 actions available to choose one to do (propose, install or build), then 3 free moves that can be done fast, therefore there is almost no time between turns and this makes the game really nice.
During the game there are many ways to get all your points, but all of them are connected... you propose projects (which are not yours) and get benefits, install previously proposed projects (again not yours) and get benefits, and then build the power plant getting more benefits... on the other side you have the technology level, giving you more benefits... and you have to do all of this keeping an eye in what your opponents are doing and need. More on this, not only you have to keep an eye on your opponents, but in the Carbon emission and what are the regions interested, because not everybody is interested in all types of energy.
Regarding the rules, it seems hard to understand at the beginning, but once you have played a couple of turns everything clicks on your head, a different point is to really understand what you have to do in order to win, and this could take you more than one play, but each play is delightful.
And moreover, you have to keep an eye in those fossil power plants that are sending the planet to the ruin... meaning that the game can end without an winner, except the destruction of the planet.
Love the game, how everything is connected and would play whenever is needed (proposing the game more than once)

The Vital pedigree is very evident in this one. I got it after playing [thing=109276][/thing] which has a level of complexity that I enjoy. This has a similarity to it that I like: while there are a large number of actions available to a player, on their turn only a couple of them are viable and yet it's still an agonizing choice. Every turn I take its interesting.

Interestingly, this is also the only game I've enjoyed playing solo. It's a different game, but still really rewarding and, more importantly, engaging.

A játék jól visszaadja a hangulatot a CO2 kvótától kezdve az új rajta erőművek építésén át a tudás megszerzéséig. Mégis vontatott, nagyon sokat kellett benne gondolkodni és így nem volt meg a játékélmény.

Semi Co-ops are a rare breed in the gaming world, and for one simple reason: if one player refuses to co-operate they'll probably win unless the common challenge is sufficiently threatening to put a stop to that. CO₂doesn't quite get that mixture right, you get VPs for building power plants, but the rewards for flipping a project (the preceeding stage) are relatively modest. That means, quite simply, that no-one wants to flip a project only to have the VPs stolen from under their noses so the formula breaks down. Also a lot of cash (and therefore VPs) seems to be generated by trading in CEPs which seems wildly off message for a game that's fundamentally a cautionary tale. It also goes on far too long, the 2 hours quoted is incredibly optimistic for a game that feels as dull and worthy as its subject matter.

RATING: 7
This is really interesting and carefully put together, but I'm worried that it may be fragile because it relies heavily on players engaging in self-interested collaboration, and if players refuse to do this, then the game can just stall and fall apart.  In the game that we played, the endgame seemed to demand this stall even though, if we understood the scoring correctly, the outcome was already decisively determined.  So the ending was weird, anticlimactic and frustrating, but I'm not sure that we played it correctly.  In fact, the rest of the game is put together so carefully that I'm inclined to think we didn't.  The tactical aspects of the game are really interesting and really closely locked together, so I'm hoping there's a saving grace for the end of the game, because I really enjoyed the first 3/4s of it.

Juego de gestión de recursos de Vital Lacerda no tan complicado como el Vinhos, pero que cuesta explicar y entender correctamente. Combiene repasar las faqs antes de empezar a jugar.

Juego bastante complejo de jugar en sus primeros pasos, con  bastante interacción entre los jugadores. Muy interesante la forma que tiene el juego para que midas las acciones que realizas ya que un proyecto que tu empiezas puede beneficiar a otros jugadores. Importantisimo el timing de las acciones que realizan los jugadores.

Conviene no despreciar la venta final de CEPs porque puede ser una cantidad de pasta brutal y dependiendo de la carta de objetivo que te haya tocado, no es descabellado tirarla para que te den la pasta.

After 5 plays I have enough.  Yeah, it's a solid heavy euro game, but it doesn't have a spark for me and is hardly controllable and tedious in the long run.  For me.

--

5-player mode is unsatisfactory - too few actions per player and you wait for your turn too long.  Too little gaming (per player) in the game.
Also - some real cooperation (incl. sacrifices from some players) is needed then.  And nobody is willing to sacrifice himself ('why me? why should others profit from this?').  And surely not players who don't do well.  The Earth goes boom and everyone loses.

Sold.

CO2 is largely a contract filling game, theme is original and good but not that strong and no where near as strong as I hoped. This led to some disappointment for me since its mostly just another pure euro convert resources as efficiently as possible to VP’s to win type game (A good one, but just another one...)  

The all lose rule doesn’t seem to suit the game IMO and would just be a big frustration rather than adding to experience. Even though it does suit the theme, and add a factor to watch for, its not a co-op so I think losing would just plain suck (where as in co-op this is the main thing you are avoiding so you expect to lose sometimes) Speaking of rules there really did seem to be too much here for what it was also

Played once, the initial note from this game was 4/10. But it appears that we made significant errors in the rules, so I need to play again. It will never be a 10 for me, but it might get a note around 7/10 one day.

So, I've only played once and this is one that I feel like I need a second play of to make sure of my feelings, but preliminarily I really liked it. It reminded me a lot of Brass, except with more moving parts and without the restriction of cards determining where you can build. That said, one player in my game really didn't like it because he wanted more control over what he could do. And he's right, this isn't your standard engine-building eurogame, what you can do really does depend on what your opponents do in this game. But that said I don't think it's completely out of your control. Like in Brass the bulk of the game is figuring out what your opponents need so you can position yourself in such a way that what they do helps you as much as possible while not letting your opponents do the same.

But in this game there are enough other things going on as well that it's not all about the building process. Managing expertise in the five types of plants is very important and so by extension is managing scientists. And the various cards do a good job of giving structure to a game in which you could otherwise easily be overwhelmed with options to start out.

In my one game however, the pollution level (the determiner of the all lose condition) was never really relevant. I think the point of it is to force some installations as that seems like the weakest stage, though I can't say that for sure only having seen one game.

This is a really tight design.  As others have said, the rulebook needs some work, and this is a real chore if anyone at the table is AP prone.  

But there's a lot going on here, and it all fits together pretty well.  It's going to take several plays to peel back the layers on this onion a bit more.

Initial Rating 7.0 (May 2014)

As I love Vinhos, I was keen on playing the next Vital Lacerda game. He is a great designer and CO2 is a great game. First of all, I LOVE the theme and what he is trying to accomplish (raise awareness of this urgent subject). It works perfectly with the game mechanics and it seems the game is very well researched. 

The game is less complex than Vinhos but still has lots of meaty and hard decisions. For the same reason, it is very AP prone so I think it is best played by 4 fast players or with less players. The game can be long (2 hours+). It has lots of rules but they are easy to learn and teach.

In general, I’m not a fan of Semi Co-Op games as the players who are behind the leader can crash the game so no one wins (a better outcome than losing the game individually), however it is done very well in CO2 because you need to collaborate in the first couple of turns when no one is sure who is winning, also when you help the world you also score lots of points so it is in your best interest to help. Finally it is not as easy to sabotage the game as others I have played with this mechanic. 

I feel the game has very low luck, but you can decrease it with the card drafting (adding more time to the game).

The game components are very good, except for the lack of scientist meeples (I feel I’m playing Ludo with them :S), also the game graphic design of the cards left a lot to be desired, it is not very clear and you need to refer to the game manual often. 

Bottom line a good gamer´s game. I will probably buy it in the near future and I want to play it more soon. I’m pretty sure it will go up in my personal ratings.

I finally read CO2 rules and I found we had played it wrong, fortunately they were minor mistakes (there are 3 ways to end the game, not 2) so my opinion about the game remains the same (CO2 is a good game). However I have to say the rules could be a lot clearer.

On a first play CO2 can seem like a typical multiplayer solitaire Euro, with shared loss conditions.  It takes a couple plays to see the incentive management needed to perform well at the game, and to construct alternate strategies to the obvious "build power plants."  Once this equilibrium is reached, the game becomes a dance to build fewer plants without triggering the loss condition.

Chicago Express with more chrome.  It's sad for me that I require the chrome to engage well with the game (I'm not a CE fan) but I am what I am.

Reminiscent of Container and Brass in player interdependence though more overwrought than either in its approach, CO2 is chiefly about timing relational cycles in order to gain competitive advantage. There are plently of mechanical levers to pull and the artwork is quite beautiful.  

Beginner's tip: Don't fall behind on the expertise tracks. The tracks are at the heart of Co2 and tie back into nearly everything you do. They give you the ability to construct plants, are a significant source of income, vps, and offer cube, cep, and expertise bonuses.

RATING: 8
This game, to me, is by far the most interesting and innovative of the Essen 2012 crop (just as Vital Lacerda's earlier design, Vinhos, was the most interesting and innovative from Essen 2010).  I like the theme and believe that the interlocking game mechanisms (with a series of actions rounds per turn, with certain mandatory and three optional "bonus" actions) works quite well.  The all-players lose scenario also adds tension to the game, which can be ratcheted up by either playing with 5 players, one of the more difficult starting setups, or with the Arctic expansion.  There's also a solitaire version which is a great way to learn the game.  Lots of options here, and enough options so each game is different, which means a high replay value.
   Based on about a dozen plays thus far, I have only two reservations which right now prevent a higher rating for this game:  (1) Most of the Company Goal cards and UN goal cards seem to reward a strategy based on construction of as many "green" energy plants, which could result in a deadlock situation in later rounds as players tend not to install projects that another player can easily finish; and (2) the Company Goal cards may not be balanced.   However, having said that, I have seen different strategies prevail with different numbers of players, like the game the best with either 3 or 5 although 4 seems to be a good number to start with.

Jan 2016 Update:  after a couple of recent plays with 3P and 4P. I have to say I definitely prefer this game as 3P, for a couple of reasons:  (1) with 3P, you get 4 actions per round rather than three with 4P, meaning you can do something in addition to the rather boring and mundane propose, install then construct that one usually sees for the opening round or two as everyone starts out doing "their own thing." (2) With three, the company goal cards seem a bit more balanced and evenly achievable, plus I guess you could play with a variant that everyone draws two and keeps one, for even more play balance.  (Note with 5P, and only two actions per player each round, it really requires some cooperation to avoid crashing the planet -- hitting the 500 ppm pollution threshold, as the only time I have seen that happen in a regular CO2 game is one time when playing with five.)  Finally, if the game isn't challenging enough, try adding Arctic Expansion which really makes the game tough.

Nonetheless, still enjoy the theme, and the game presents a challenge every time out.

RATING: 3
Feels like something was off during our first play. The premise of the game is essentially a game of chickens between the corporations until someone cracks to save the planet.

However, the tension from the pollution track wasn't really present. The designer expects the first game to be loss and it wasn't the case at all. It seems there are a few tense moments where the future of the planet is somewhat in danger, but once it's passed, the players simply have to focus on each other.

And once that stage is through, the game becomes really boring. Because you are only allowed one action a game, it's incredibly easy for other players to steal your next move. Unlike other games, where you are faced with tough decisions to make because you can and want to do too many things, CO2 allows you a decent amount of options each turn.

The problem is that none of the options are usually that appealing because they open up opportunities for others to steal your next move. The most common scenario is the decision to install a project. This opens up the opportunity for ANY player to simply "steal" your project and install a power plant. Because of this, most of the game time is spent thinking about actions where others can NOT benefit from you. I think this is not the right experience for games like this. You want to offer a wealth of good options to take, not be forced to always take the action that least benefit the others.

Most of time was spent mulling over options, checking if others have the necessary resources to steal your power plant or not. It didn't really matter what the power plant was or where it is made, as long as others cannot steal it from you. I feel this is a really boring way to play a game...

Because of this, most players simply do nothing relevant during their turn, waiting for others to do something first. I guess this is fine if the threat of pollution was real, but once it's passed, nobody has incentive to install anything...

Simply put, I don't want to spend 2+ hours figuring out what others CAN'T do.

There are a lot of moving parts to this game. Many things to keep track of. Not fiddly, just a lot of information to digest. It might be a good idea for the first game to exclude the special achievement cards. We totally forgot about them until the end.

Played a game, but didn't enjoy myself very much, even after we figured out how the pieces fit together.

I'm particularly worried about what happens once multiple people have the expertise to build power plants of the same type. Basically one player does the hard work of proposing and installing a project, but there seems to be no reason why another player with sufficient expertise can't then do the final step of building a project. The original player gets a totally inadequate compensation for this, since almost all of the score is directly or indirectly tied to power plants. I really hope there's a rules error somewhere.

The game looks striking (in a good way), but the information design proved to be very confusing. A good player's aid.

I don't really care at all about the environment, but I do enjoy the theme, mainly because it's different than most of the other games out there. I also really appreciate the effort that has gone in to the artwork. Too many games have a standard illustration style that is either ugly or boring. I like the modern, evocative approach taken by CO2. 

That said, the game itself was less interesting than Vinhos, though probably a little easier to digest rules-wise. I'm not sure I really care for the extended time it takes to bring plans to fruition, and I definitely dislike the cooperative aspect of the game. Though I suppose that it is thematic, it's all too easy for a greedy player to completely destroy the experience, like in the game Terra.

My rating and comments are based on solo play only.  This is a game with many interlocking, moving parts that the rule book does a poor job of explaining in a smooth and cohesive way.  I found the game to be dry and slow moving.  The solo rules seem an afterthought, and the solo victory conditions are of the beat-your-own-score variety.  I had high hopes for this one, but, sadly, it didn't do it for me.

     - Environmental theme
     - a bit misleading in regards to social awareness regarding corporations, the UN, carbon impact.

Would I play it again - sure. I don't think my score will change much though.

RATING: 7.5
I enjoyed immensely the game of this I got in at BGG.con. Everyone, or a lot of people, complained that Vinhos was too fiddly; I haven't played it, but this was butter-smooth and the only stumbling block we found was that we kept moving the CEPs around wrong. (There's a reminder on the player aid that we didn't notice until halfway through the game.) 

I think there's plenty of fun to be had here, but the theme didn't strike me as particularly strong except in that it models the collective action problem of CO2 emissions by making it incumbent on everyone to try not to lose for everyone else, the only issue being that no one would ever try to win by not scoring the points you get by building green power plants anyway. In reality, the costs to overhauling energy infrastructure are, I think, much higher than this game reflects, as are the long tail in emissions caused by fossil fuels. You do not simply march into Mordor with your reforestation plans and bump coal power plants off the table.

But anyway, the CEP market is interesting and I think if we'd been playing properly it would've been much more vigorous. I'm tentatively giving this a 7.5 just because the theme is a little light on the ground and I never felt quite the panic that I actually do about carbon, but maybe my expectations were too high. You have to love the watercolor graphic design - it's phenomenal, and even though the board is laid out like Die Macher's, it's still remarkably pretty.

Interesting game that I'd be willing to play again if in the right mood and a good "teacher" can explain the game to the new players as this one can be tough to understand.  It's definitely not a difficult game but I think the subject/theme has to be understood in order understand game play.

I really like the knowledge track and how that works and thus the scientists and the summit events which are the avenues that feed into it (are there any other games that closely follow this, I wonder).  Unfortunately, at midpoint the game overall disappoints as it seems to stagnate to a certain point.  In one game for example, I would activate projects which would then set up other players to profit from construction.  Later when it became my turn again there was nothing to construct so my only option was to activate another project thereby once again setting up another player for construction.

Rated a six, I see my rating dropping through the six range and perhaps settling at a five after a few more plays as I quickly tire of this one.

[b]CO2[/b] - [b]semi cooperative[/b] game where players play against each other until the moment they need to work together, in order not to lose the game.

Every player is CEO of an energy company that needs to add green plants (and stop pollution by reducing fossil fuel power plants). In order to do that you need to propose project, install project and construct power plant, while in the process other players can continue where you stopped until power plant is constructed (which means you can prepare everything for someone else even that is not your intention). It is mid (on heavier side) euro game with interesting theme and good mechanics.

Vital Lacerda's games are quickly becoming infamous for being "overly-complex" or "brain burners", however, I don't feel that these are justified conclusions. Mr. Lacerda is quickly making a case for himself to be one of my favorite game designers with back-to-back games that not only drip with theme, but are intuitive and fall right into place. CO2 may have the appearance of an overly complicated economic game, but once you get past all of the easily understandable rules you will find a game that plays smoothly and quickly. A semi-cooperative game where players are attempting to save the planet's environment and rid itself of fossil fuel dependency this game's theme is a fresh view for a Euro game. Only more games will tell whether or not this game can hold up to multiple layers of strategy, but after having played Vinhos several times I'm sure this will as well. I look forward to the next big box game from Vital Lacerda.

Games should be rated based on the quality of play, not on the political undertones of the subject matter.  That said, most of the ridiculous 10's by people trying to prove a point have been removed, so I'm going to remove my counterbalancing "1" rating, which also had nothing to do with the game.

As a total aside, if you are a global warming alarmist, and you don't support nuclear power, then you are a moron.  If you are going to claim to be a follower of science, then have the moral fortitude to apply that claim to all areas of science, not just those that suit your views.

Back to the game, I'm hoping to try it soon.  As somebody else said, it is nice to have a game that is not about shipping goods in the middle ages.  But, theme is completely secondary to gameplay, so I will withhold judgement until I have played.

Edit:  I've played the game a couple of times.  For some reason, they often seem to end with the destruction of the planet.  It is hard for me to be cooperative, especially in a game that is not cooperative :).  Nothing wrong with the game, but I don't enjoy it that much.

C02 is a heavy euro game whose theme (sustainable economic development in the face of mounting dirty power demands) is both timely and somewhat educational. Lovely board. Rules and iconography (while language independent I'm sure) could use some more illustration/streamlining but this game does a good job of relating the theme to the rules. Great implementation of semi-cooperative - highly political with a large player count. Difficult not to blow up the world when capitalists reign. :)

This game tries really hard to make me hate it, but in spite of that, I really enjoy it.

The theme feels like I'm being screamed at by a crazy environmentalist, which I don't really like.  However, the theme is also pasted on and the game feels kind of abstract, so I can get over that.

The components are mediocre -- not bad and not good.  For some odd reason, the power plant tiles are not double-sided and have the same back as the fossil fuel plants.  This is an annoyance.

The rulebook is a disaster, but the game is fairly simple to understand.  There are lots of steps, though, and it is easy to forget things.  Also, the game missed out by not including a picture card manifest -- describing them is less-useful.

Of course, there is no viable storage solution included with the game.  

However, in spite of all those factors, the game is really fun to play.

I had written a 10 page essay on why I do not like this game but thought it could wait a second play before I consign it to the never play again pile. I originally had it as a 2 and have raised it to a 3 on the second playing. It worked a bit better but it is still a dry unexciting and otherwise dull game. The rules take ages to plough through and are not compensated by the games play. Do not get me wrong, the mechanisms work but thats it. Strategy is limited and consists on "stealing" someone elses efforts, which always leaves the victim feeling disgruntled and out of pocket. (The rules point out that there is no ownership, but the mechanisms still leave you with that impression and the compensation for the loss is not balancing). Aggressive play is rewarded and the panic of stopping the world from blowing up by group effort is non-existant. Lastly this game is over rated because of stupid idiots rating the game without playing it because of their own ignorant political beliefs. The rating should reflect a games playability not an idiots political belief and skewing the results because of it. If they wish to spout political rubbish there are better forums and they should be kicked off of geek. People are buying games based on their reccomendations, as I said Stupid and Ignorant.

At first I thought a game about CO2-emission sounded rather boring. And the instruction book gave me a hard time as well since the German translation was really confusing. But the ideas and the mechanism have grown on me and now it's one of my favourite economic games and Lecarda found it's way on my table top in many other ways like Vinhos and Kanban. Fantastic game!

Decent game, lots of indirect/race/competition interactions.  Not too keen on the "shared loss" mechanic, feels a bit moralizing and doesn't make play more fun.  Solar seems overly important/powerful.  Still fun to play, decent depth.

RATING: 8
A dense and interesting resource management Euro-game.  I suspect that it's optimal with 3 players but it might also be good with 4 also.  The turn sequence, actions menu, Expertise track options and resources all add up to a finely tuned optimization strategy game that should clock in at under 3 hours.  All the interlocking mechanisms fit well for a deep Euro-game.

RATING: 6
Only have a very partial play thus far, but I can see that players really need to work together in this game.  In a four player game, polluting factories are going to be added to at least two continents each round the first three rounds so one needs to realize this and act accordingly.  The game is fairly straightforward but has quite a few interweaving parts that could be confusing your first play.  I'm still nervous since everyone could lose, this game will lose steam with my group is one person is doing poorly and tries to sabotage the game...There are also quite a few interwoven mechanics which can be confusing and frustrating.  Fairly simple, but deciding which direction to head can be difficult.  Board is puke ugly...several people have made that remark when I've put out the board...:-)

Sold as semi-coops don't work around here well.  I know, this isn't a cooperative game, but the group must work together to keep down the CO2 levels to some degree and there is always friction/argument over who is responsible for making sure this happens!

This is a VERY deep VERY dry game.  The attention given to the theme is impressive and definitely helps to make sense of why elements of the game interact how they do.  I think that, while I like the game, I'd prefer Vinhos or Kanban if I'm going to settle in for such a deep game.

Initial Impressions: The flow of CO2 takes a little while to wrap around, even for someone likes me who has an environmental background, but once you do get it the game has surprisingly little overhead. 

Interaction level is pretty high for a euro, as you do not have control over the projects you propose or install (which might be even too much since this game gives you very little ownership of things), and it is often advantageous to go to the same UN council as an opponent in order to get the bonuses on the technology tracks without getting your scientist stuck.

From my fuzzy memory of a review I watched a really long time ago, I was afraid the game would feature more the garnering the political support to combat climate change than actually combating it all, but that didn't really seem to be an issue.

I normally don't like semi co-ops, but in this one for the most part your actions help the planet, it is just you might choose an action that helps yourself more and the planet a little less.

All in all, I definitely think I need more plays to know how much I actually enjoy the game. The theme definitely is one I enjoy so it has a high ceiling, but I'll have to see if I feel like I am actually combating climate change or not in future plays. For example, the carbon emissions permits, the need to have certain knowledge of different technologies to construct them, and that if the designated continent for the round to get new technology doesn't receive it resources are funneled to it all make thematic sense. However, I am afraid the scoring options of the game will in the long run make it feel too similar to other games, namely that the technology tracks once you go past being to build that technology are basically generic scoring tracks, and also that the UN policy cards or whatever they are called are basically your run-of-the-mill order cards.

This is an interesting title and was a nice surprise. Timing can be a big issue here be careful not to set up someone else in the process of setting yourself up. Sometimes it could be in your favor however. Remember that you don't own anything someone else can come through and complete that project you were working on.

RATING: 7
This game begins with only a few constraints and most are pretty easily dealt with so the sandbox is pretty wide and open.  Expertise is the biggest limiter in the early game as to which green projects you can construct, but after a decade or two, it's no longer an obstruction.  In fact, the biggest constraint (and opportunity) soon becomes the other players as every project is a three-stage affair and anyone can do any part of it.  Often your action leads directly to another player's benefit and vice versa.  It becomes quite brain numbing so much so that I find myself blanking out on something as simple as seeing if I've built projects that match one of the ten sets of projects on the bonus UN cards.  I mean, it's a moronic set collection mechanic - match (usually) three symbols on the card with three symbols on your projects scattered around the board.  A six year old could do it better than me.  The other thing that bothers me about [thing=72225][/thing] is that it's got a lot of little things going on with the rules.  The player cards are really helpful in this regard, but do I ever look at them when I'm playing?  No.  I still want to love [thing=72225][/thing] and I think I could if someone else knew the game better than I and I could let them worry about them.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very good game, lots of moving parts and several things to keep up with. The only problem I had with the game was it seems unfair to the person who installs a project because they will unlikely not be able to construct, but instead give the points to someone else.

Solid design. The board is gorgeous - I love watercolors.

You can't learn the game from the rules. Read the rules first, then start playing. Midway through your first game you'll get it, and then it's fairly straightforward.

There is little downtime and AP is not a huge problem, because there are only a couple of things that you can do during your turn.

The rating would probably be higher if I was a eurogame fan. This is one of the best euros I've played.

It's a very good game: it has some backstabbing and, at the same time, you won't want to backstab your friends too much, or everybody will lose.

There's a lot going on here, and, therefore, there are some tactics to be explored and a lot of room to play in an unconventional way.

The learning curve is quite steep too.

Rate should improve after some multiplayer plays.

What a fun game.  While it initially may come across as preachy, the game doesn't really have the feel of trying to get across a message.
Essentially you are playing an environmental exec who is trying to install better sources of energy around the world.  You hire and send out scientists to propose new power plants using better energy.  They then install the plant and construct.  Each player can piggyback off of the play of another player so strategy is high in this game.
There's even a slight co-op feel in the game due to the years track.  As the game progresses and rounds are finished, years will start ticking off.  Every decade there's basically an energy check.  If certain power criteria aren't met in particular regions of the world, then they will require a "dirty" plant in place of clean energy.  this causes the pollution track to go up.  Anything above 350 causes "disasters" to happen which basically takes resources out of your hand.  If the track ever reaches 500 then everyone loses.
However, the co-op feel ends there.  By the end of the game, victory points are given out and there is a distinct winner.
GREAT GAME!  Find a copy and test it out for yourself!

A deep game with many interesting mechanics. The game has an admirable and inspirational theme for a board game but it' s a heavy game though and won't attracts the more casual players, As a fan of Vitals games the complexity was fine, but  it benifits from making at least three practice turns(testing each main action) in your first game before even venturing into competitive territory. 

It did however feel like it was one rounds too many in late game (a bit too repetitive) - it just made the game feel unnecessary long. With a new rules variant from Vital or just a house rule shortening the game then I would probably give the game an 8. 

Definitely worth a try.

I have described this game as 'a brutally competitive semi-cooperative game of tremendous depth'; I see no need to change this description after 5 plays.

I like this game a lot. There are elements that make it a difficult game for me: it's not an 'engine builder' so it's not the worst sort of game for me, but you have to build a number of resources and focus on multiple end-game targets (expertise, CEPs in hand and in controlled regions, UN bonuses and company bonuses). I find this type of game hard. 

There's some indirect interaction between players in the 'screwage' category, but there's also some direct competition for regions and the CEPs they provide. 

I do have one area of 'complaint' in that I really don't think it plays well with 3P. The reason for this is that there are two three-step cycles in the game (the market and the power station build cycle); with 3P these can play out badly. With 4 and 5 it plays out well and even manages play length by adjusting the number of player turns in a round.

Fun game with two distinct phases. Players need to work together to prevent disaster. Once pollution is under control, then the truly competitive part of the game breaks out and its every green energy mogul for themselves. 

Ultimately traded it away. I still like it, but it was just too hard to get to the table. 

But...then I re-aquired it because it's just too good not to own.

A complex semi co-op game filled with cool mechanics, combos everywhere and a very concerning theme. The rules explanation can be long, the gameplay a little heavy, but the whole components and the experience of the game itself are unique. At first it´s confusing and you don't know what you're doing, but after a few turns it starts to be clearer. CO2 is for sure one of the most strategic games I've played, deep, competitive, excellent after some plays!

Theme is great, semi coop is right format for theme, such potential - so much that cld be done here. Yet every time I play it, I realize it's more boring than i had hoped for. You just sort of do stuff for 3h without a master plan, major conflicts, no progress. Just the same in an overly complex system with unnecessary additional rules - then once a game all panic for 2-3 moves (10min) to save the earth. You compromise - because u have too solve the issue - and then all fall asleep again for the rest of the game. When it is over, no one cares who won because all feel like winners for having endured the boredom and can finally do more interesting things like go to the toilette, sleep, cut finger nails ....

Solid but not spectacular game.  Not quite up to the standard of his Vinhos, but still lots of stuff going on and lots of choices to make.  I was disappointed to find out beating the game much easier than I expected: hoping it would smack us the first game but we handled it pretty easily.

As I was riding my bicycle to work this morning, some other thoughts popped into my head.  First, how easy it is to get a project accepted.  Being in the world of solar energy research, I know how difficult this is in reality.  Also, how you can 'jumop a claim' is a bit weird: perhaps there should be some type of bidding war between the competing companies for the rights, especially if you displace a pawn?  A $1 compensation does not seem adequate... Also, it is odd to me how the world population and energy use clow down as the game goes on:  Africa fills up in, what, 1990 or 2000?  I would think the problem gets worst with time rather than better.  Plus, the fact old factories no longer continue to pollute was a disappointment: maybe they could be represented by an extra 10ppm per remaining old plant during the game.

I really love the theme and how the actions of other players can launch your pieces to the next level. In order to succeed you want to pay attention to what other players want to do. In the meanwhile you want to keep enough resources to accomplish your own goals. The technology track is key to the game. 

I had a fear of the end-of-world end-game scenario where pollution gets too high. Mostly because I thought it could be a game spoiler for the player that's furthest behind. Fortunately single-handedly causing the end-game would take a lot of ingenious work, work that would better be spent trying to win. Curious how many games actually end with everyone losing... my guess is that it rarely happens.

I enjoy the theme, but don't like the limited one action + one free action per turn. 

Players who construct a power plant gain many of the benefits including vps... leveling up a power plant online is a three step process: propose, install, construct with resources given to players at each step, but only vps to the player who finally constructs the plant. 

Any player can construct any plant which has been installed by another player to gain vps. Very annoying... someone else does all the work and then an opportunist jumps in and grabs all the credit.

Game is also very process oriented. Well themed game, but would rather play other longer, more involved games given the fun element in this game is a bit low.

I was heaviy predisposed to like this game as I have spent many years in a long career working on environmental and economic sustainability in higher education. I'm glad such themes are emerging with Euros. I've seen enough castles and medieval villages. CO2 is not all didactic (a good thing) and it teaches its players virtually nothing about climate policy, other than too many fossil fuels increase carbon PPM. 

However, the game (as a two player) fell flat for me. There is a sameness about it, and it took way too much time to learn for the strategic rewards. I'm glad I played it as it has some interesting design ideas (the timing of research and implementation), and the pseudo coop template. Perhaps, it is more dynamic with multilple players.

I'm impressed and supportive of the effort, but for my tastes, a fun factor is lacking.

The artwork is better to look at than to play on.  During play, the tokens on the expertise track cover the icons - interfering with the game play; the proposal and factories cover the continents - interfering with the beauty.

Gameplay becomes standoffish.  No one wants to install a proposal so that someone else can build it.  This means you spend many turns without actually advancing the game. That standoff may be interesting to some, but to us it was boring.

The semi-cooperative nature of CO2 brings it down a notch from the other wonderful games in Vital Lacerda's catalog. While I understand it thematically, I dislike the "take that" element it imparts between players as they initiate projects, only to have them completed (and scored) by someone else.

There is a LOT going on in this game and it does take some time to get your head around how the actions link together - but link they do!
You can also spot mechanics that Vital Lacerda has used in his subsequent games of Kanban and The Gallerist. Like those game the sweet spot is probably 3 players as it takes a long time with 4.

Wow! Finally after 4 years of owning this game, I get it to the table (requires hardcore gamers).  Even though the game play at first appears quite simple, there are a lot of ramifications to consider with your available decision space.

I have to say that Mr. Lacerda's games, although maybe not the most exciting of theme's, have theme integration that is second to none, especially (for me) this game and Kanban.  Just an Outstanding gaming experience.

I made several rule interpretation mistakes, so I'm very much looking forward to get this back to the table with the "correct" rules.

RATING: 7
Interesting theme, for this semi-co-operative ecological game. Its deep strategies and multiple decisions though are not enough to make it shine. The game rules are a bit confusing without a good reason, and the long playing time  may make it a little boring.

Modern themed euro style masterpiece. This game packs a punch and has many things to consider during a turn. You have to balance the overall world pollution, scientific expertise, and controlling different regions of the world. Turns are relatively easy to understand despite so much going on in the the game. The components and theme are outstanding.

This falls into the same bucket as games like Pax Porfiriana. The game works, and is functional. However, the game play itself isn't really all that fun. I get that this game is supposed to depict the deterioration of the O-Zone Layer and the side effects of such, but the game is essentially one giant puzzle where everyone has to cooperate, even though there can only be one winner. I think that this game works well as an educational tool, but there's no way you could throw this in front of children and expect them to grok it. The game is also incredibly fiddly for what it should be.

Surprisingly thematic euro where you need to choose among actions to plan and build plants to maximize your victory points. Quite a few rules to keep in mind to play optimally and perhaps too long but overall a fun experience. My main concern is that it is difficult to set up a strategy as other players may "steal" your preparations but I need more plays to tell whether this can be countered.

Another heavy game from Vital Lacerda that puts you in charge of an energy company that promotes projects around the world for clean green energy. As you work for the best interest and profit of your company you also work together with the other players so you don't destroy the enviroment of the planet. It's a very good game with nice mechanisms that need careful planning and good timing as the outcome of your actions don't belong to you. Another player may come and continue your project where you left it and steal the glory and points from you. You constantly must keep an eye to your oponents if they have the resources and means to take your project from you.

A very complex Euro. The cooperative aspect is exaggerated as we have never came close to losing. The game play, while challenging, is not entirely interesting, innovative, or give players a feeling that they could outplay others. Even though decisions aren't obvious, it's very hard to tell if some actions are better or worse than others. 

A couple of games in, I feel that there are too many "other things" that leads you to victory - not building plant, but probably the advancing on tech track and even hoarding CEPs. While the game's theme is about building plant, the way to win is to focus on the other aspects - while makes the game awkward. 

3/4/13: After playing it for the fourth time, I have almost no desire to play again. Dropped from 6.5 to 5.2.

This is a good game, the theme is even better, and while not 100% accurate, it is a good way to make a board game about the topic.

It really feels modern in the way it deals with something which has and will affect us all.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming

I'm concerned that my groups games will almost always go to a loss for everyone, since one group member feels that winning by denying anyone else is also a victory.

This will perhaps be a drawback and could affect my rating of the game after future plays.

RATING: 7.5
I generally think of the common strand among the games of Vital Lacerda as being weight derived largely from a preponderance of interlocking systems. In that sense, this is an abberation -- I think it is the least complex of his games that I've played {Vinhos,CO₂,Kanban: Automotive Revolution, The Gallerist}. Here, the weight derives more from the explicit system of partially-shared incentives that arises, more in the vein of a Container or a Chicago Express.

There's an elephant in the room, though. The rules specify that all players lose under some circumstances (and under all other circumstances there is a single winner). This makes it a dreaded "semi-coop". In my now 4 plays of this, it's been a non-issue: the CO2 did not get too high, and no conspiracy arose to push it high. Logically, I believe that all players who think it unlikely they will win should want all players to lose. But either enough people disagree with me, or it's not clear enough who's losing early enough to matter, or the right levers aren't there to force the issue in my experience.

I hadn't played this in a while, and I played VL's other major games since the last time I did. I think this might well be my favorite of his games. There's a lot of good interaction going on here, although it does ask a lot of the players to be tracking what things they should not do to feed the win to someone else.

The first disappointment of the 2012 Essen crop.

It seems "complicated" to play in the wrong direction: a lot of micro things to pay attention to, but there seems to be no corresponding depth in the offered choices.

I may change my opinion with further plays, but at the moment I am not so eager to try it again. 

It is a matter of taste: I miss the wide strategic depth that I am searching in games, substituted by a set of tactics and calculations that I find more tiring than rewarding. 

You may enjoy it, I feel the love and effort of the designer, just for some reasons I don't like it.

Ein bisschen zu komplex für meinen Geschmack, aber vielleicht war ich auch einfach nicht in der richtigen Stimmung, als wir es spielten. Zudem lassen die Regeln einfach zu viele Fragen offen, so dass beim Spiel viele Regelunklarheiten auftraten.

I love the theme of this game.  I liked my first play through, and the more I play, the more it grows on me.  On the first few plays it felt entirely chaotic.  I was simply taking my lobby and corporate agenda cards as advice and playing to them. Now I see that there are plenty of opportunities for strategy.  There are all sorts of weaknesses your opponents can expose, and winning is all about capitalizing on them well carefully balancing the PPM level.

E con questo credo di aver toccato tutti i Lacerda. Co2 l'ho trovato un po' diverso, un po' meno cura nei materiali, un gioco un po' arido, dove forse l'ambientazione si è sentita meno del solito, ma al tempo stesso un gioco più fluido dove non si sono trovati tanti 'minigioco' scollegati ma un insieme più armonioso. Un gioco da riprovare, non banale ma personalmente lo considero meno bello di The Gallerist.

One of the very few heavy euros I'm highly interested in playing due to the theme. 

Finally decided mot to buy the game. After getting more information, the true problem of why CO2 emissions can hardly be decreased in reality is that the actors in this field don't have immediate incentives to apply new technologies accordingly. That is the most interesting aspect of the whole climate change issue. In the game, however, there is a direct win from developing clean energy. Effectively, the game misses to address the key question.

AFTER 1ST PLAY

RATING: 7
Rated after one play with 4 players. An interesting game in which you have to use a limited range of available actions as efficiently as possible. The ability to grab opportunities set up by other players seemed to make the game rather tactical once the threat of all losing, and therefore any need to act co-operatively, ended at a fairly early stage. I would like to play again, but if it does prove to be more about grabbing opportunities provided by other players rather than developing your own strategy my rating might go down.

You start the game thinking wondering how it hangs together. Then as it unfolds and you disect it, it all comes together nicely. You have to put up projects to get the things you need to earn tech advances, and/or the dollars/resources to build. You flip projects to earn further instant rewards, and then build them for VPs. And you also get VPs (or money) from the tech advances, in which you're trying to be first or second in each. Everything else is beautiful disguise. And it is beautiful because the game hangs together nicely thematically. It doesn't feel like a get resources/convert into VPs Euro, and it does tend to capture the big picture issue of getting us to a clean Earth, though obviously abstracted. It felt like the game was very tactical, that what you can do on a turn is dependent on what's left you by previous players. And conversely, you want to advance your causes without providing too much of interest to the next player(s). Whilst not as big a RHP issue as Hansa, the poster child for such, it's enough to drop it down a rating. Whilst engaging, trying to sort out a best approach and eke out advantage, it did also get a bit same-y as the decades rolled by, facing and addressing the same issue of what to do each turn (largely dictated by what's left you). Interesting enough to explore, but not interesting enough to earn oodles of replay.

It's quite a nice game, the mechanics work well, a lot of choices and neeed for planning ahead. There is a little problem with runaway leader: if you're the first to build four different power plants you will easily pick a lot more UN goals than anyone else. 

It's a pity though that it's soo ugly. It also has a few layout flaws.

An interesting theme that actually works with the game. You are building environment friendly plants in order prevent the end of the world, while scoring points for doing so. There is a lot going on, but there are three main actions which once you get the hang of them you can see what you should do. But watch out as others will often block you and sometimes, in order to prevent the world from ending, you must work together, yet you win alone. In our last play we got to a point where no one wanted to install projects as it gave points to others for construction. Caused a very dull ending, not sure if this is a problem with the end game or our game play.

After two plays, I feel this game is very unintuitive and has a steep learning curve to appreciate the finer points buried in the mechanics. Sadly, though, the overall lack of fun quenches any desire to invest the time into it. Add on the poorly designed components (almost identical cardbacks, horrifying confusing iconography) and the ratings for this really drop for me. Off of my 'buy' list and will likely never get played again.

Definitely a well designed game. Plenty of avenues for victory. Definitely a meaty beast. 11/1/15

Deducted half a point for the rulebook. It really should of been better. Breaking the code for what each card means is annoying and needed a helpful Geek's file to sort it out. Referring to the rulebook is simply annoying due to the layout. 14/4/15

Update: dropped to a 7 from an 8. Just not seeing the table anymore. I'd rather play Lacerda's other titles. 21/7/15

I love how this game modeled the world--energy consumption keeps on increasing, and if you don't build renewable plants fast enough, fossil fuel plants will pop up to satisfy the demand, pushing the world closer to crisis. Unfortunately, the game is prone to stalling, as your moves could very well set up the next player. It was more difficult to set up yourself (but easier at lower player counts). The stalling got much worse in the end once the threat of everyone losing was gone--so bad that I can't help but think we must've been playing wrong somehow. Hmm.

Really looking to get some more plays in, especially with more players. Solid Euroish game that is really tough to do well in. Love the tension in the game.

Update: Actually plays pretty well solo. Not sure how often I would bust this game out to play by myself, but I was surprised at how fun the solo game was. It's tough and you only have 6 actions a round, but it's like a ever changing puzzle.

Update 2: I still have yet to get a play of this game in where we haven't fucked up the rules to some degree. The game is okay, although I still am not sure how well the co-op/competitive aspect works in this. I'm giving this one last play to see if it holds up. Right now I have it for trade and I'd be willing to entertain any offers that arise for it.

C02 the gas, now appears to me (I am representing the public)as to be an evil created by the industrial revolution. So hooray and rejoice we are pioneers of the world trying to rid the world of this by product that will kill us all. So the theme is a goody and interesting to see it in a Euro game. However C02 the gas is not really an evil and creates balance in nature, so trying to rid it in it's entirety is not necessarily true to life. C02 the game is a game full of mechanics as a typical Euro game should be. However as in the game there is too many mechanics (just as there is too much C02) and keeping track of these markers and counters that need to move is too much. In theory it works, but when your working on your strategy, following what the other players are doing and moving the markers to keep track of the game it builds up to be too much. Just like in the game, everyone loses if there is too much C02 the gas, and enjoyment is entirely lost due to the amount of mechanics. When it comes to Euro games I prefer something less laborious and something more pure.

Didn't make the cut- as playing it leaves me with a lack of air.

I'm really enjoying this game. The theme is one that is unique and one that I enjoy. The mechanisms in the game also make perfect sense within the theme, making this heavy game flow nicely. There is a great tension that comes from projects belonging to regions rather than companies until they are built.  My primary gaming partner tends not to enjoy heavy games (particularly those with many resource conversion steps or special abilities), but she really enjoyed the interlocking pieces in this game. 

Rating caveat: in a two-player game you need to push to drop PPM below 350 in the early or only play 4 decades. It is a little too easy to max out the tech track otherwise.

Let there be no doubt about it: this is a pure gamers' game for those who love strategy and no luck. And in it's genre it is 1 very great game! 

I already liked Vinhos from this designer, but I like this one even more as it is more streamlined (you don't have the complex Fair-part here), but with still some little rules here and there you have to remember not to forget to apply them. It's really cuththroat to get things done in CO2 and you have to be willing to give something to someone else or the planet will be screwed (a very nice feature this part).

Instantly one of my favorite games. There is something so clean about the mechanic, that despite being "heavy" it flowed so smoothly. Intense decisions, really because there are so many options. "There are only three actions you can take!" Right, but you want to propose a project: Which one? (solar, recycling, fusion, forestry, biomass...) Which continent? For which reward? And if you can install or construct something as well, then I hope your fellow players have good patience. Except you will be extending it to them on their turn as well.

Everything builds on itself and impacts what you will do next. I want those scientists, but if they are not on projects or summits it is a waste, I could have gotten money or cubes or something. And which track do you go up every turn? Do you knock out the guy and give him a summit because you really want to go up the biomass track this turn? I need cubes! Do I throw that guy off the solar so I can install it? But then he completes a summit! Man, if I go up the biomass track I get a free forestry, but I am behind of recycling, I am not going to get any income there! Oh and don't get me started on the UN goals. Maddening!

I haven't seen the pollution be a real danger, which is maybe my biggest qualm. I want that to matter. I want to have to fight to survive, not have it be a token, toothless threat. I keep taking out natural gas plants, so maybe I will see it blow one day. The other issue is those damn lobby cards. There is enough to think about with throwing that in there to confound everything. I heard Vital plays without them, I think I am going to avoid them from now on.

I'm itching to see what Vital Lacerda did on this one. If it is at least half good as his previous game (Vinhos) I can see this one being a favorite. Theme is original and sets it apart of other games, normally about [insert medieval kingdom here]. I hope the designer continues this trend.

Big thinking economic game. Much like many of Vital Lacerda's other games but this one rose to the top of my favorites of his titles, that I have played. I felt in control of my actions and I could feel the struggle of the game and what we needed to accomplish sort of as a team but not actually working together since there is 1 winner or all losers. Collected this in a math trade and am definitely interested in exploring it further and with an additional player to see more interaction.

Tentative rating based on two-player games alone.  I like the simplicity of the rules and the reliance on player interaction to drive the complexity.  I recognize it is not at its best with two, as games of this ilk rarely are even playable with two.  The expertise tracks, for one, aren't long enough to accommodate the length of the two-player game.

This game makes me think. I'm still not convinced there isn't a hidden strategy gem somewhere. The rule book is terrible. The game components are pretty from a distance, but not very readable even up close. The game forces you to work with other players to survive, but the personal benefit for setting up other players to build is not obvious until the third play.

The theme and artwork drew me to this game initially. I love the interaction, very different from any other game. You have to balance your personal goals with the changing state of the board. I think some people have a hard time getting over the co-opetition aspect where you start working on something and someone else completes it. Ownership is transient, another opportunity will present itself.

IN REALITY: A semi coop where I use my "Go Green" stiletto knife to slit the throats of peace loving hippy scientists at the "Summit of Doom!" In other words, it was a tad more competitive than I expected.

The theme is solid in this, trying to save the world from pollution by building clean energy stations. Allows you to plan ahead of time on which kind of pollution you want to focus on. Rewards balance. At certain stages the game could get into a deadlock where everyone has piled up on resources and waiting for someone to flip a token. Some of the starting game objectives are harder than others. At first play, the mechanics can seem a bit clunky, but a good game overall.

An interesting game with very tight mechanics. The first few plays might be spent figuring out just how much cooperation is needed with other players. It's fun to watch the tension build as you get closer to disaster. Balancing saving the world and getting the most recognition is a very tricky game. Certain strategies aren't apparent right away, like hoarding CEP or purposely letting a disaster occur.

Some small concerns I have with the game:
1. I think VP should be more expensive in the end game. It seems to eclipse all other ways to gain VP.
2. The company goal cards may have balance issues.

I also struggled with the rulebook for a little while because it is very heavy on advanced terminology that really only makes sense once you see the big picture.

Overall:
A very enjoyable game that takes more effort than most to fully understand. Some gamers will likely get lost in the details of the rules, but those with patience will find very tight rewarding mechanics. Play more than once before making judgement!

Deep and complex Euro game. Although there are numerous different things to do (building power plants, CEP market and its  manipulation, gaining expertise in different plant technologies), after 3 games I had the impression that there is only one way to victory: Get diversity in plant types to claim goal cards; you get higher expertise levels on the way there (which is a big victory point generator in the end). Maybe there are more paths to victory (specializing in one plant type / one region?), but I think it is more of a race to plant diversity. Since you do not sacrifice any actions for gaining more expertise or entering the CEP market, there  are no considerations as "building  plants vs. gaining expertise vs. market manipulation". However, this does not make it necessarily a bad game.

In general the game is very fiddly (gaining expertise all the time) and it takes a bit of concentration to "run" the game. That is actually reducing fun for me. Do not fear the  semi-cooperative aspect. Deep down, this is a very competitive game. I also do not understand how some people are offended by the theme, if they do not believe in climate change caused by mankind. In this game you are a  power plant company that wants to build power plants (more than the competing companies) and "saving the planet" is not your primary goal. However, the theme and mechanics  are not as well integrated as in Power Grid. In Power Grid you are really an economic company, which builds power plants to make money, whereas in CO2 you build power plants for victory points while the needed ressources are gathered by other actions (subsidies, income from "expertise"); so Power Grid feels more like an economic game whereas CO2 is a game of rather abstract game mechanisms (but the CEP market is quite thematic).

The art looks nice at first, but makes the symbols (especially on cards) harder  to recognize (acquarell background :( ). Rulebook is really bad for such a modern game (wall of text; rules are not in order of actual gameplay). Additionally, the rules are rather complicated and take rather long to teach (the problem is that the mechanisms depend are interwoven and cannot be explained separately).

As all 3 plays (even with different groups) all played out very similar, I have not much desire to play CO2 again. Especially, since this is a beast of game to explain as all mechanisms are interwoven. This rapidly dropped from 8 to 6 to me.

RATING: 7
The rules complexity / startup effort is quite high; and, like Vinhos, there is a ton going on. Players create green power plants in three phases: propose, install, and construct. Interestingly, after each stage, the project can be progressed by any player (not just the one who initiated it), although placing a scientist on the initiative can be a good way to ensure you get some return (a displacement fee) if an opponent grabs your project. Gaining expertise in 5 technology tracks is key to building these plants and is achieved in a number of ways, such as sending your scientists to speak at conferences. Players providing the most green energy to each of the world's regions control the carbon credits for those regions, but are also responsible for managing the effects when a disaster strikes due to unchecked carbon levels worldwide. Secret goals, money management, and much more in a game with a primary action selection mechanic. Great production and art, and a good theme. (1+).

I love the interaction of the game's mechanics and theme. The game is complex, but it is not complicated. There are several things to do, but you always feel just one move or one scientist short of the perfect move before the round ends. I really like that in a game because it forces you to prioritize to perform only the most important tasks and not all the tasks you wish to perform.

Another great Lacerda title, published after his masterpiece Vinhos!

(+) Fascinating theme which fits the game perfectly
(+) Game experience feels original, different
(+) Rather a lot of depth for a 2-hour game with this amount of player interaction
(+) Beautiful artwork

(-) It has more player interaction than I'm used to in a euro game (which will be a + for many players, but I feel it sometimes tends to make an otherwise clever game slightly chaotic).
(-) Given the gameplay feels very different, some people might find gameplay somehow abstract - but I don't agree.
(-) Like any semi-coorperative game, there is a certain field of tension between playing 100% opportunistically or partially cooperating. I guess I'm not really fond of semi-cooperative game systems.

We enjoyed grinding the wheels and seeing what sort of sausage was being made.  The various mechanics of the game aren't that difficult, but it took a bit of time to see how to better capitalize upon them for gain. 

One player (4P) game did seem to have a good starting hand of lobby cards making me think that drafting those should be used for all games, including beginners. 

If anything in our game, we were too cooperative and not competitive enough.  No one stole a power plant from under another player's installed project with scientist - suspect more aggressive moves of that ilk will bring about a more interesting game.  Our game actually ended a round early by lowering the CO2 under 350 ppm in 2000.

The challenge is managing the three currencies (CEPs, $, Cubes) in the game and trying to manage each effectively.  On top of that, the UN Cards encourage diversity of power plants and expertise which means tweaking even more levers in the game.

--Dec2012-- I liked the dynamics of the game; it was unfortunate that some of the procedural recommendations made things slower than they needed to be.  Some of that is the fiddliness factor:  there's a bunch of things that Must Be Remembered - and a procedure isn't a terrible way to achieve it.  But several of the recommendations (specifically, the Construct flowchart - why discard the old plant then a couple of other things before consulting the discarded plant to discover by how much to reduce the CO₂ level? - and the market mechanics - there needs to be a visual reminder of "No Sale":  one could achieve that by placing new discs on top of the price marker, for example) are distinctly imperfect.  In the end, we had a game that would have been delightful at three hours (or shorter!) that was still going strong the four-and-a-half hour mark.

RATING: 8
Excellent choice for a theme, although some of the bonuses and resources generated didn't feel very thematic (it was difficult to keep track of which project offered what bonus, and white cubes always felt like collecting white cubes, not 'tech resources', and purple discs just felt like another generic resource, not 'CEPs'. Also 'Installing' a project doesn't really make sense). What you're generally doing, though, fulfilling demand for power plants by proposing and building clean energy plants to replace and reduce polluting power plants, comes across pretty well, though.

While the game's mechanics aren't super original or exciting, it does work pretty well together, and you can pull off some satisfying combo turns by interweaving your turn action with various free actions. It also felt almost too long at 3 players, so I can't imagine playing it with more. I enjoyed it overall.

I liked the theme and the artwork, but the game is grossly over-complicated. After one hour straight of rules explaining, half of the thinking effort is taken by remembering the silly restrictions. Plus, the game felt buggy near endgame, with little to no tension on money, pollution or CEP, no incentive to take actions because they will benefit to the player sitting next.

RATING: 5
I don't feel strongly about the theme either way, but think that oversimplifications and abstractions incorporated into the design, while typical to euros, do it serious harm by turning it into a missing truth propaganda.

That said, the game itself is much worse than I expected. It offers little control - each turn you have only a couple of possible moves of which usually at most one makes sense. You have to build power plants in order to save earth (duh), but you don't want others to still your project and build on it, getting all the points, but there's no way you can prevent it.

Also, it doesn't scale well in my opinion, it's certainly not recommended with five - with reasonable bad luck in drawing the dirty plants, we executed the end of the world once at the end of '80s and once at the end of '90s (so much for the realism), with no one willing to diminish their chances of winning by making sacrifications boosting another player.

RATING: 8
Awesome economic game with loads of player interaction - helping, hindering, watching, reacting, defending and if you're a sceptic you can even take joy in crashing the carbon trading market. Best of all is how it all ties into the theme and the theme isn't just built around a mechanic. It's rather involved with a lot of ways to score points and a lot of choices and directions you can take. It also plays very differently with different player numbers. A tad too fiddly for its own good though.

If you wanted to overanalyse and work at ruining the experience you could break the game down as a worker placement and area control game. But the mechanics don't hit you in the face if you think of the logic behind the different aspects of the game and use this logic to help you remember the rules. It's one of those games where picking it up again after a long break is easy because the theme makes sense. Sure there are abstract aspects to it, like deforestation being classified as a type of green power plant, but I'm thankful that the designer simplified the concepts somewhat for the sake of ease of play. And it is easy to learn and play as long as you follow the steps on the player aides when building a plant and don't jump over the place and forget one of the steps.

Once you've got a game under your belt you can step up the game a bit with card drafting and an auction round to lessen then card luck (very minor) and grow the planning element of the game.

I suspect it'll really help with your first play if you take 20 minutes to watch Joel Eddy's Drive Through Review. It makes reading the rules much easier than I suspect it would otherwise be. That said it's very thematic and intuitive once you've got a couple of turns under your belt.

http://boardgamegeek.com/video/23961/co/drivethrureview-150-imperial-killer

For those who have difficulty for whatever reason accepting the theme then I can assure you that belief in global warming is not a requirement to play, just as believing in dragons is not a requirement to play Dungeons and Dragons. If you can accept that energy can be produced from various sources and that carbon trading exists, then the game makes sense even to the most ardent sceptic. If you can accept wind power plants in Powergrid then this isn't much more of a stretch.

Another excellent title from game designer Vital Lacerda. Innovative in its design and choice of theme, this is an attractively produced game that is not only fun and engaging, but also a fair simulation of a cap-and-trade market system. In this case, a cap-and-trade market for Carbon Emission Permits in order to slow down the negative effects of atmospheric carbon on climate change. 

As with Lacerda's previous title, Vinhos, CO2 is a carefully crafted masterpiece where even small game nuances are interwoven with its theme. Just to highlight one example, I love how the "forestation power plants" simulate the potentially important role that carbon-offsets can play in a CEP market. When you install the forestation power plant tile in the game, you get two CEP's for your efforts, which can then be traded back to the market, or used to install carbon emitting projects elsewhere. There are several other such nuances between game play and theme that are a delight to discover and explore. 

The game is not perfect, and in the inevitable comparison with Vinhos, I think that CO2 falls slightly short in the production department. The rulebook and board, though far from badly designed, are not of the same high functional calibre as that of Vinhos (though keep in mind that Vinhos sets a very high standard). The victory point track, expertise track, and iconography, especially on company goal cards, all could have been improved upon. 

Another minor complaint concerns the use of "cold fusion power plants" as a concept in an otherwise realistic game. When I play I call those plants "advanced nuclear". It is the one thematic oversight in the game. 

However, all these are but minor quibbles with what at the end of the day is a truly remarkable and ground-breaking game.

Eurogame bastante duro y con un tema muy original. Igual de bueno a 2 que a 4. Las primeras partidas generará AP y resultará difícil saber qué hacer. Cuesta un poco hacerse a la idea de cómo te beneficiará lo que estás haciendo en el tablero. A la tercera partida todo empieza a cobrar forma, y se vuelve más orgánico. Mecánicas sencillas y turnos relativamente rápidos, unidos a tomas de decisiones duras y pequeñas(aunque crueles) dosis de interacción, lo convierten en un juego que genera sensaciones distintas a los típicos euros. Tiene un mínimo componente cooperativo, pues si la polución alcanza un determinado valor, todos pierden la partida. Una muy grata sorpresa.

Love this game.  The theme really comes through and as someone who believes in climate change and doing something about it, this game feels very real.

CO2 has some interesting player interaction. The first part of the game is about setting yourself up for the competitive portion of the game while cooperating enough to keep pollution from overwhelming the world. The later part of the game is purely competitive, but there is still room for elements of cooperation in the summits. The scoring opportunities are very player driven, and installing a project gives the player after you first shot at building that plant, which is a rather significant scoring opportunity. At the same time, money is worth a reasonable number of points, and you can take your income as points or coins, so if you don't get good scoring opportunities from projects, you can still do a fair amount.

My only play of this was messed up by some oversights, but this game is very cool.  Lots of moving parts, but not quite as many as Vinhos, Lacerda's last game.  CO2 is more intuitive as well.  Everything seems to make sense.  I really like the co-opetition aspect where you are helping folks out in an attempt to help yourself as well.  An excellent game that will only go up in my esteem.

So, I played again tonight and I have to say what a great game!  It's long - 2.5 hours with a 30 minute teaching time, but it's pretty excellent.  I'm sure the play time would drop with added plays.  There is a lot to take in and it is a bit fiddly for some folks.

I did find the "disasters" a bit underwhelming as they just basically become a means of sapping a little technology.  I also find it odd that you know that they are coming.  Still, I very much enjoy it and I look forward to additional plays!

I think just calling the "disasters" ecological incidents instead, makes it a bit easier to process in my brain.  Every one of my plays of this has been interesting.  One of the things that I like best, is that there is no ONE strategy with which to try and win this game - something I love in gaming.

We love this. The cooperative aspect gets a bit harder with the mini-expansion, but we've had no chance of losing without it. That said, the more we play it, the more selfish we get and the more concerned we are with maximizing points.

The complexity, and the fact that winning often has little to do with saving the planet and more to do with exploiting UN goals and manipulating the CEP market makes this a huge success thematically.

The only downside is how often we're still referencing the rulebook after 5 plays. It seems to be more so than most Euros we play.

And an extra 0.1 for having the most beautiful board on the market. Great presentation and colors. 

Is it crazy that we've used this game to introduce friends to the hobby? If people can handle this, they'll be down for most any game.

It took most of our game to figure out all the things that we were doing wrong, (mostly confusion over needing scientists to take actions), but I enjoyed the experience, despite being a bit frustrated by it.  That said, by the end we got most of it straightened out (the rulebook was very well written and was a nice source guide for any confusion). I certainly liked how the game ended up playing and wouldn't be surprised if my rating went up.  

If the players know the game, I'd imagine that this could chop along at a quick pace, but my one complaint about the game is little there is to do with the downtime (especially with a five player game).  The system feels very opportunistic, and while you certainly have your strategy (dictated by the cards that you initially draw) more times than not you look at the board and try to figure out the one best move for you.  Fortunately, there are usually two or sometimes three to to choose from.

For some reason we kept getting the trefoil symbol and the recycling symbol confused.  Yeesh.

Early days but I'm very impressed by this thinky game. Not surprisingly, it reminds me of the Gallerist, with actions having multiple consequences. Some of the stuff you do seems a little contrived, a little fiddly, but the theme basically shines through. There's a real feeling of pressure: Will the Earth survive! One downside, the rules are very dense and it's easy to miss important rules. (I missed a few!) Go over the rules forum on BGG and read the "easily missed rules" post.
(Although the only actually unclear rule was the one that requires you to use your "free" scientist move before constructing a power plant if you have that scientist on the plant project chit.)

I know we got a few things wrong (e.g., max CEP in each continent, how to handle your own scientists when installing a project), and probably others we don't even know about. But I am still taken with the game and wouldn't mind having a copy! 

What a cool game! A lot of interweaving stuff is going on, and it's hard to appreciate the connections until playing a bit. I like the semi-(semi-)cooperative nature of it: you can all lose, but you don't have to cooperate _that_ much, really! 

Definitely need to play this some more!

[b]Vital Lacerda Variant[/b] [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1561769/]Thread[/url]

With this variant you are weakening the value of building and make more obvious the power of installations, making it easy for first timers to understand installations advantages and avoiding the stall in the last decade. It also shortens the game.
1. CO2 must be played from 1 to 4 players as it was initialy designed.
Avoid the 5 players game, especially in your first matches. 
2. CO2 always plays in a max of 4 decades on all player counts.
3. To install, players don't pay CEPs anymore, and 1 expertise is increased to the player on the type of energy installed.
4. Building a power plant costs the player a CEP and 1 more coin, and does NOT increase the expertise any more.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
The board shows 6 continents, each with 3-6 spaces for power plants, and with a random set of 3 types of power plants it will allow. There are also several summit tiles, each showing 2-3 types of technology, placed in a ring around the center of the board. The center is the Carbon Emissions Permit market, showing a price 1-8 (starts at 2?) and up to 2 available CEPs. There are also several tracks:
- a Decade track records each of the 5 (or 6) game turns
- a Round track (7-n rounds per decade)
- score track for players
- global CO2 track
- a technology track for 5 different tech types (solar, recycling, grain, forest, fusion)

At the start of the game, draw one random fossil fuel plant (gas, coal or oil) for each continent, and mark the sum of CO2 production on the CO2 track. The rest of the plants are sorted by type and cost (cheapest at top) and placed nearby in Supply. Players each get some CEPs, money, lobby cards, a scientist token, and one secret Company Goal card. Place several UN goal cards in a public display. Shuffle the deck of continent cards, place one card face up (= current region at risk) as well as the next card on top of the deck (= next decade's region at risk).

[b]GAME SUMMARY[/b]
- 5 (or 6 in a 5er game) decades
- Each decade: Supply step (income, energy, event - skipped first decade), then Operation Step (7-n rounds, with players taking their actions)
- After decade ends, pass Start Player marker left
- Game ends
... after Ops Step at end of 5th (or 6th) decade, or earlier if 2 regions are completely green or if CO2 goes above 350, then returns below 350
... after Supply step if CO2 500+ (everyone loses)

[b]DECADE SUMMARY[/b]
- Each Decade, players collect income (any combination of money and VP) for each of the 5 tech tracks where they are first or second.
- If any continent has fewer plants than the current turn number, and empty power plant spaces, place a random fossil fuel plant there and add to the CO2 total; the player controlling that region pays 1 CEP (from personal supply or any region you control) to the bank
- Any region with technology cubes pays one
- If CO2 is 350 or higher, DISASTER! Players without a plant there must pay 1 tech cube (placed on board near region)
- If CO2 is 500 or higher, everyone loses!
- Then, for (7-n) rounds, players take their turns

[b]TURN SUMMARY[/b]
Players may take a single action + free actions.
[u]Action Choices[/u]
- Propose Project: place a project of one of power types acceptable to a region in one of the 3 spaces available for the region; collect the appropriate reward ($1/CEP, 2 tech cubes, or a scientist token)
- Install Project: pay 1 CEP (from personal supply or any region you control) to flip a previously proposed project; collect the reward on the back (e.g., tech cubes). If another player's scientist was there, pay them $1; they immediately take a free Scientist Move. If your own scientist was there, you must take a Scientist Move as one of your free actions, and move that scientist.
- Build Plant: you must have knowledge in that tech greater or equal to the number of tech resources needed to build it
... remove the previously installed project, pay the costs (money and tech), and place the top plant from that tech group in the leftmost empty space of the region (if no empty spaces, replace the leftmost fossil fuel plant)
... if another player's scientist was on project, they get free Scientist Move
... place ownership marker on plant; if you now control the region (based on number of different types of plants there; then rank of plant types; then expertise in highest ranked tech type etc.), place marker in indicated space
... score VP for plant (shown on tile)
... gain 1 expertise in that tech type
... I'd suggest giving every player a cube or bead in their color; place one of these on every UN Goal Card with that type of plant (if you don't have a marker there already) -- it'll be a lot easier to see when you (or another player) is eligible to claim a card!

[u]Free Actions[/u]
May only take each of these actions once/turn
- Scientist Move: move from your hand to a project; project to project ; project to hand; or project to summit (same energy type); all project/summit targets must be vacant. If all spaces on summit become occupied by scientists, resolve [i]at end of your turn[/i]: each scientist earns 1 knowledge in the tech type where they stand; each player with any scientists present earns 1 knowledge in any type discussed at summit
- Market: buy 1 CEP (if market empties, raise price by 1 and refill market from bank) or sell 1 CEP (but not if price changed this turn)
- Card Action: either play a lobby card for its one-time benefit or for its bonus effect based on the type of action you took; or claim a UN goal card (shows a combination of plant types which you must have built, and a VP reward - scored immediately)

[u]End of Turn[/u]
Choose one of your scientists on a project: score 1 knowledge in that tech type. This may give you other bonuses (depicted on tech tracks), e.g., advance in a tech, earn a CEP, add a CEP to a region

[b]END OF GAME[/b]
- Players collect CEP from all regions they control; sell all CEP at current market price
- Earn 1 VP / 2 coins
- 3 VP to player with most tech cubes
- 3 VP to player with most UN goal cards
Most VP wins!

It's a good game. The decision making is often related to what the board offers, turning the game into a tactical challenge, sometimes more than strategic. Which is not a bad thing if one considers the interaction. 
Despite all that there seems to be not enough actions to perform in a 5 player game. 2 actions per decade makes it extremely dependent on other players moves and that's something I didn't like. 
Also find it a bit repetitive as the actions, in a five player game at least, seem to go around in circles: propose a project, flip, place cientist, build. Propose a project, flip, place cientist, build...

Need to play a 3/4 player game.

I find it really weird that a lot of folks find the theme controversial - most of the world accepts man made global warming as fact. What will matter of course is the game play, and given that the designer brings a passion about his subject to his games this might just be special - certainly one I will be looking to play.

Having had a wonderful month long holiday in the USA in May/June 2012 I now understand why the subject matter could be controversial - it seems to be almost a taboo subject with almost no media coverage or public debate whereas in Europe its almost accepted as scientific fact. Never mind, the games the thing.

-------

2 games played enjoyed both but suspect will enjoy more with less than 5 players - partly because there are leas actions per player with 5 and partly because the company goals seem (at first sight and play) unbalanced (i.e. some extremely difficult to achieve in a5 player game)with some much easier to score than others.

I prefer this to Vinhos - the interaction is subtle. The art work is lovely but some players in my games struggled with the iconography and lay out. Desperate to try with 3

I think after a couple of plays it may be  essential to draft the lobby cards to try and match company goal cards. Also knowledge of what you have passed may help you in deciding what projects to propose/install - either to incentivise  other players to buy off your scientist or not to give them the payoff.

The game is not didactic - you could play this with scepticism towards the subject matter as at heart its a business game with the climate change market the way of making or losing money

In 2 games the designer has established a style of a limited number of actions supplemented by mini actions - also by clever game global effects and strong themes. Co2 establishes him as one of the leading designers of 'gamers games'.

Wow, Good looks, Good theme. After just one try I am impressed with the mechanics, far from knowing how to play/win...

A few sitenotes: The card types are hard to keep apart, the colors are too close and it would have helped (a lot) if they had their type printed on the back, without destroying the pretty looks.

There are a few issues in the english rules, but nothing too bad (yet). I'm pretty sure some rule clarifications will follow...or maybe it's just me.

I had some initial concerns that this might be a little too complicated. I love Vinhos, but it is a hard game to teach and get to grips with. CO2 is so much simpler though than the initial comments had lead me to believe. You have a choice of 3 actions, all fairly simple to do, and 3 free actions you can take during your turn, but only once for each of them. Not really that difficult. What is difficult though is using those actions efficiently to ensure firstly that you are keeping the ppm count sufficiently low, and that secondly you are racking up enough VP for the win.
The solo experience is pretty nerve jangling as well, and moves quickly from defeat back to possible victory only to fall to defeat again.
I see replayability in this as well, and feel it will last the term, so it might even make it to a 10. The possible downside is that any AP prone players will likely pass out playing this, and play times could really rocket with a few players who really can't figure out the optimal path.
All the additional parts also fit in nicely with the main heart of the game. The only thing I struggle slightly with is understanding the significance of the CEPs in the game - I get what they are, but feel a little confused about why you can buy and sell the, on the market.
But anyway, wow oh wow, a great game, and one of those, like Vinhos, that I find myself thinking about. So much so that at work today I started figuring out on a spreadsheet the most optimal path to victory for a solo game. Came home, played it, messed it up a little, and lost by hitting 500ppm on my very last turn. It all looked lost, then I overbuilt a Coal, moved down to 440 with 2 plants to draw. Drew a gas... And then a damned coal. A happy loss.

Update 2017
1 major issue with this game is the playing time, and this keeps it from the table. Spotted there is a second edition due that fixes this, so I promptly sold my first ed and will now order the second when it is released.

RATING: 7
Intense economic game with a lot going on. It's interesting how you can "steal" projects from players, but need to propose and install plants to gain resources.
Notes on common complaints:
* This really isn't "semi co-op". This is not about saving the planet - it is about making money! It's a full on competitive game in which players will sometimes take mildly different actions to avoid the "everyone loses" conditions. Often this makes no difference to the game at all. At other times, it's just a mild rubber-band, since there is more incentive for a player in the lead to make a slightly less optimal move for the "greater good". I don't think you'll ever have to make a "bad" move though.
* You don't need to spend your energy stressing about other players "stealing" your projects. You propose a project to gain the benefits of proposing it. You install to gain the benefits of installing it. Build to score the points and add to area control. People WILL use your projects, and that can work just fine for you.
* Fiddly and confusing. Yep. The rulebook is a bit of a pain to reference as well. The reference cards are fine once you know what they mean, but the learning curve is steep. Well worth it in my opinion though.

Me parece un despropósito que mucha gente no pueda evaluar objetivamente un juego. 
Hacer un juego es un trabajo arduo (demanda tiempo, inteligencia, esfuerzo, creatividad, investigación...) el enfoque elegido para tratar un tema muchas veces es el "políticamente incorrecto", pero no debemos olvidar que un juego de tablero tiene como finalidad entretener, divertir, hacer razonar, socializar etc... pero definitivamente no tiene como finalidad hacer política, educar, ni mostrar la realidad tal cual es, ni tampoco, enseñar el sentido de la vida.
Estas personas que puntúan con un 1 claramente no entienden nada de lo anterior y por eso destruyen el trabajo de Lacerda. 
Nunca jugué CO2, pero mi indignación por lo que hace esta gente, es tan grande que le pongo un 10 para compensar ;)

Oddly beautiful, though with some curious design choices that make the cards all but identical, this is a joy to behold. Until you put those purple CEPs on. 

As for the game itself, I'd need to play it some more to fairly rate it, but initial impressions were that you had a decent number of choices and the game allows some clever play on the part of the players. Our game bogged down in the second half as no-one was willing to build a project so that someone else could install it for points, but this was perhaps in part because we misjudged the value of installing (failing to take into account the VP value of money). Well worth further exploration.

How Lacerda, how do you do this? You get an interesting theme, wrap it with great mechanics that integrate well with the theme, add a ton of strategic and tactical depth, keep it fun and engaging and all this with an elegant system of a few available choices, with minimal turns, but each one significant and game changing. Oh and don't forget, tons of player interactivity - nail biting tension every time you realise someone could build a factory right into your preciously held region. I particularly like trying to outfox your opponent by setting yourself up for a factory build just as they are unable to follow through with it.

An interesting semi-co-op economics game with a good theme, it's a bit counter-intuitive (the theme carries extremely well in places and very poorly in others) at times and the rulebook is IMO quite poorly written, so it may take a while to get the hang of it. It's not truly complex or difficult though, even if it is clearly a gamers' game. Word of warning: Even though there is individual scoring for each player, you WILL lose if you don't keep the co-op aspect as a priority; just like in real life!

In terms of theme and aesthetic, this is an extremely novel and intriguing game.  Top tier in both categories.  And the mechanics are strongly connected to the theme.

I also like the forced cooperation of ensuring the global pollution levels don't grow out of control, while still competing to make the most money off of the clean energy industry.  Reminds me of Archipelago in that respect.

I also appreciate that the designer's seeming cynicism towards the current state of the global energy industry is tempered by a ray of optimism and hope for the future.

This game is one meaty beast. In fact, it's irritably convoluted and the rule book is a terrible mess. I like the thematic approach, I dig the artwork, I like the brainburning to a certain  degree even though there's not a single second where you can let your guards (thoughts) down, but that is also the reason why the game just isn't much fun but instead it gets weary after hours of full-time concentration.

Interesting game with unique mix of existing mechanics.

The endgame snuck on me and my relative advantage on the expertise tracks disappeared after a couple small movements, resulting in a huge point swing. I'm sure that can be mitigated with better play, but it felt a little random.

The choices felt sort of limited. Install Project, Flip Project, Construct Plant. Rinse and repeat. You can change that up by bumping other players' scientists, or taking a slower tack, such as Install, Install, Flip, Flip, Construct, Construct. That might help utilize summits more efficiently.

RATING: 7.5
This wasn't a surprise - I was already expecting a solid game. And [b]CO₂[/b] delivered!

The downtime is more in the long side, because you can not interfere in the actions of other players in ther turn in any manner (except giving out opinions and complain, of course). The iconography that criticized Libonati, took some work, it is true, but besides the letters of purpose, nothing complicated nobody in the game after 1 or 2 rounds of action. But the caveats stop here.

In [b]CO₂[/b] the players represent companies that are working to propose, develop and build renewable energy or non-polluting power plants or reconstitute the environment (the five areas are: biomass, solar energy, recycling, reforestation and nuclear energy). The construction yields points and gives to the company's scientists expertise, that they use to make them more profitable and able to interact with others types, and can provide the coveted carbon bonds.

The game system seems complex at first, but unless we played wrong (does not appear to be so), it is straightforward and quite functional. One difference is that the game requires partial cooperation among those involved: only one win, but everyone can lose if carbon emissions reach 500 ppm - on any continent where, for a full round, a plant or an action "green" wasn't builded, a pollutant power plant is drawn and is added there, pushing up the feared carbon marker closer to 500 ppm.

In our game the emissions hit 490 ppm! But the world has seen the error of his ways and started to invest in clean energy, then by the end of the match, the marker was at 340 ppm.

The points can come from buildings, meeting UN demands and also converting income in points. I have always a good set of options in every turn, which can produce some AP, but I like to have many options to choose from - restrains reminds me more of the game playing me.

All in all, the 7.5 rating has more to do with the need to explore the game further.

I love the theme and the way it is interwoven into the mechanisms is great. On the paper the semi-cooperative part of the game is great but not owning the projects can easily slow down the game to a game of who installs a project first. So if you do not want to keep feeding your opponents you may be locked into defensive play of doing as little as possible for several rounds. And that is enough to ruin the game for me.

I really wanted to love this game, but it just didn't do it for me. The art and theme are incredible however, and I think it's worth owning just for this. I will admit, I have been growing tired of Euro games as of late, so that may be having an impact on my impression.
I just felt there was too much going on, it was too "mathy" and felt more like a spreadsheet than a game. I also did not like starting a project to have another player finish it. I think if you love deep strategic Euros, you really need to give C02 a try. It just fell a bit short for me personally. I have vowed to play it 3 more times to see if it can improve in my eyes. If not, it goes to the trade pile.

RATING: 7.5
It may be scientifically flawed, but I found the theme of this game original and well chosen. I could not help but feel a sense of satisfaction when I replaced one of the coal driven power plants with a green one, lowering the global emission of CO2. In addition, I find the artwork to be really refreshing. As a game, I concur with the opinion that CO2 is a complex game to learn from the rulebook, due to a multitude of little procedures and piled on mechanics. But when you persevere, the game really is not that hard or "heavy". The lobby cards and disaster effects are a little too weak for my taste, but otherwise I really enjoyed the game. Would like to play again to see how replayability holds up.

i was very excited waiting for this game to come!!!it had great potencial......
but it dissapointed me.
it's complicated so much and without a reason.i think the designer was designing a great game but somewhere in the middle he made it a mess!!!
really complecated with no reason,it could be a great game.
maybe i give it a second chance.

felt like a very shifty co-op Caylus in a way; had a lot of game options that kept changing and needed to be paid attention to every turn; need some more play throughs for a better idea and feel of the game; intriguing though; played 4 and 5 player thus far

Easier to learn than Vinhos, though no less intricate. The game is not *quite* tight enough regarding the pollution fail state, so it never feels like you can leverage the prospect of losing to gain an advantage (not that that would be terribly thematic, but it would improve the semi-coop part of the game). As an economic game, though, it's very interactive and engaging.

RATING: 4.5
Initial Impression - limited plays

Has a lot of things I like (economic engine, building capability [research] levels, etc.) and quite a few I either generally don't or really don't like (area control [there are a couple of notable exceptions to this - El Grande CitOW], take that mechanisms, goal that award VPs but are seemingly not well balanced, etc.) in a way that works, but doesn't seem to work all that well, leads to being extremely prone to AP, and very long play time. 

It is not a bad game, per se, but I also don't think it's very good, and am pretty sure it's not for me.

RATING: 7
Complex and intriguing mechanics was a definate strong point. However, they often cause massive downtime because of how the mechanisms interact and because you can analyze them and then probably paralyze.

Another major factor is the art. It is beautiful, but it is beautiful to a degree that I very often had a hard time distinguishing whether an element was part of the art or actually had a game-purpose. This is also my biggest beef with the game. There are just so many elements in the game that are hard to separate from each other that it caused unnecessary downtime. I would have probably enjoyed the game 1 or 2 ratings higher if the art was a few magnitudes less "artistic" and instead purpose-built.

At this time I'm not sure if the game dragged out because it was so complex mechanically or because the art was screwing with our perceptiveness.

The theme is quite interesting, and the idea of playing the market for carbon credits, and working with goals that are a bit more real-world than "make the most money" is very unique. It's a fascinating look at the policy and market that goes into a carbon emissions credit solution.  

The gameplay is clever, but I wonder if it's too clever for its own good. For instance, the scientist mechanics feel a bit arbitrary and overdone, something which could have been simplified away without the loss of strategy.  The artwork is beautiful, but the game definitely suffers from too many icons when text would have been better in some cases. The game is also not simple or clear. It's very difficult to formulate a strategy, and much of the gameplay feels like blind thrashing.

Ah, everyone's favourite political hot potato. Which really shouldn't enter into the equation, you don't have to support slavery to play Endeavor, or wiping out Indians to play Nieuw Amsterdam, etc.

This game seems complicated, but it's actually really simple. There are just 3 things you can do on your turn. You either put out a new project on the board, flip a project that anyone previously played, or build a power plant where a flipped project is. You must do one of those 3 things no matter what. Each of them provide a benefit such as money, points, expertise, etc. Optionally, you can place a scientist, or buy/sell a Carbon Permit at the market, or play a card which gives you some money or other asset.

What makes the game interesting is that everything is inter-related, this is not multi-player solitaire. Projects don't belong to anyone, so you can propose a new project for money, then the next player flips it for money and tech cubes, then a third player builds it for points. You possess scientists, and it's to your benefit to have other players kick you off a project, allowing them to go speak at a summit meeting for expertise points.

So all the players are collectively building power plants, but the winner is the person who best looks after himself during this process. It's not really "co-operating", it's getting more than your share while you all do similar work.

One game with 5 newbies, it took quite a while to go through the rules and it was still quite unclear. We didn't realize how co-op this game is, at least we were just trying to get points and something done and it was too late, when we noticed how much it needs to take the planet. Sometimes the theme is nicely tied into the game, other times it feels very non-intuaitive. The board is not very clear either.

Second game with 3 newbies. The rules phase was still not very clear and there were couple of errors in the first round or two. Now we managed it much better, but the game was still very long and we missed the last round (the CO2 level was at 350 then). We played it more co-op now and the results were better.

The problem with the game is that there are lots of things to remember, which can be easily forgotten, which cause troubles. The cards are not very clear and the rulebook is not good either.

The game itself might be rather good, but it is not something I would like to try again, if there are alternatives... :)

Only 1 play so far. 
Slightly dislike the fact that it takes 3 whole turns to build something yourself, and unlikely that others will not take it. Control of large areas seems too powerful with no way to remove tokens from areas you don't control. It felt like I was losing the game at the 1/3rd point and had no recourse to save it.

Played 3p, may be better with more players since you can build more off other players. More chaos.

Played once. I'm curious to play again to better grok the system, at which point my opinion could change. CO2 is not quite as overwrought as Vinhos, but almost! Why not just play Container instead? The dynamic is similar and Container doesn't have all those fiddly rules.

I came away from CO2 feeling lukewarm to it. It is a very unique game and I am not entirely sure I figured out where the levers I should be pulling were located. The game is 100 percent competitive, yet every action you take is of a co-op nature. I lay plans for a plant, someone else builds it. I look to invest in solar energy, so I take someone else's blue-print. It's zany and completely outside of the realm of anything else I have ever played.

Don't get me wrong, the process is completely justifiable within the game's theme. It is easy to see the abstraction of one company laying the groundwork and infrastructure for new energy and then a second company actually doing the building and staffing. It makes sense...but as a game, it is way off the beaten path of every other engine building game. Usually you buy the land, then buy the resources, then build the engine and finally collect it's output. Not here, you may only be involved briefly in one or two steps of that chain and who gets the payoff, well, I guess that's where the game is.

What I'm saying is that while I have no doubt that this is a stellar piece of game design, right now I have no idea how it all fits together. It's hard to teach, hard to know what you should be doing or not doing and most of all, hard to not accidentally lose the game by moving too slow while you are meandering around trying to figure out how it all fits together.

So for now, my rating is low because I don't get it. Hopefully I will get to take another stab or two at it and my understanding will improve, because I think there is something here. I just haven't connected the dots yet. If I do, this rating can only go up because this is absolutely an innovative piece of work, even if I don't entirely get it!

Another Lacerda. My favorite euro game designer. CO2 struggles a bit in my esteem simply because the strategies for it are so transparent; looking at the opening board-state illuminates which single track you should hammer on for the entire game. Doing so, when others are struggling to diversify is as near a sure-win as I've seen. If others are as astute and take a hard-line singular approach it can be a very tight game.

I'll only play this game with my oldest and heavy gaming group who all play to the singular power strategy.

Excellent theme sure to generate controversy. More than that though, this is a heavy weight Euro with lots of decisions to make and think about. Good production value. I haven't grok'd whether there's an issue when everyone gets to the point where they don't want to flip projects that may give opponents a chance to build them.  I do think this occurs later in the game and the meta game changes to where you grab smaller VP's rather than the larger power plant ones.  An excellent successor to Vinhos, this game give you a lot to think about.

I was really surprised by how good this game turned out to be. This is an oustanding euro with very fresh mechanics. And while it's far from being the most elegant design, CO2 still provides an extremely satisfying gaming experience. It's tense, competitive and full of player interaction. There's nothing quite like this game out there, I always have a blast playing it.

CO2 shines with 4 players!

Nothing particularly wrong with this game, but nothing outstanding either.

I'm not sure that there is a lot of "there" there.  The whole CEP market mechanism seems irrelevant and tacked on.  Plus, the game seems to be driven by the external goal and lobby cards.  Without the cards, there wouldn't be much, if any, differentiation in strategy options.  So, the strategy seems kind of tacked on and artificially created.

We did play with only three, which seems to make the game a little "looser", but I can't see that it would get all that much better with more.

I may not agree with the scientific conclusions given to us by mainstream media and politicians BUT I am a passionate believer in sustainability, conservation, pre-cycling, recycling, and reasonable development of more efficient energy. I love this game because it is based on these principles and it encourages us to think about what we need to do as responsible stewards of our Earth.  If I mysteriously disappear after revealing Big Government's diabolic secret you will know what happened to me.

I'm itching to try different strategies, and playing the game in my head while away.  This needs to be published!

There are nice depths to this game to be explored.  The first play can be daunting, but its mechanisms do not pollute its theme.  For example, I love that when I gain three points, the world gains three points (except when self-serving cards are involved).  There's a certain beauty to it, and it conveys the message that when the world benefits, we benefit.

good : Awesome design of the board , original theme , area control with green factories , coop against the CO² rising

bad : A lot of little rules you easily tend to forget, doesn't seem possible to loose against board in normal mode. 

neutral : doesn't seem to have a great variety in strategies or choices at first. there's the obvious area control and racing on the tech tracks. what's left ? choosing which energy to invest in , letting market prices rise or not (depends on all players), triggering other players projects or not and letting their scientists get experience. fulfilling your objective. Seems more about the subtile handling of all the levers

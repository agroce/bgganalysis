Basically, a far superior version of Settlers.  The exploration/colonization theme and mechanics are nice, as well as the civ building.  Just a very good game.

I think this might be my favorite of the Settlers Spinoffs (aka, Nuremburg, Starfarers, Stone Age, Struggle for Rome, Anno 1503) but I wish it played 2, like 1503 does. I guess thats what the card game is for! :)

As with most Catan series games, the players are at the mercy of the dice (luck).  Anno 1701:TBG is an interesting but lengthy game that is a cross between Seafarers and Anno 1503.  There is plenty of boat movement and exploration.  Overall, I like it.  I just wish the game didn't drag on for so long in addition to the extra length from the Settlers-style leader bashing.

Settlers of Catan with low luck and included seafarer expansion. Now every dice throw means new resources, no trading downtime while your store is empty and you have to watch the other players build their buildings. The far better balanced Settlers of Catan since 2007.

RATING: 7
Fun Settlers of Catan variant.  Much better than Anno 1503: quicker, more interesting exploration, and meaningful trading.  Still Settlers though...frustrating when your numbers are not rolled.

I enjoyed this, but it is a bit of a mish-mash; some stuff from Settlers, some stuff from Starfarers, some stuff from Anno 1501, maybe a dash of Candamir. The mixture is pleasing, and the new addition (buildings that give special powers and home resource boards where you have to pave over resource producers to get powers) is a nice addition. But I'm getting to the point with the Settlers-derivative games that it really needs to give me more. I liked Candamir and Elasund because they really were fundamentally different games that were clever in new and interesting ways. Anno 1701 doesn't quite give me that on first impressions, and I'd probably just stick with Settlers or Starfarers. Anyway, not a bad game, and I'll definitely play again, but in a year where I'm getting a lot of new games I really like (Agricola, Pandemic, Witch's Brew, Keltis, Teuber's Wüstensohne, plus Race for the Galaxy and Phoenicia from late last year), Anno 1701 doesn't stand out.

I would basically say Anno 1701 feels like a mix of the mechanisms from Starfarers, Anno 1503 and Catan.

It feels a little less prescriptive than Anno 1503 which when played by a group of seasoned players was basically a race to fill the public buildings, obtain 3 trade agreements and generate 30 monies.

In 1701 the player interaction is much higher as the classic catan trade mechanism has been re-introduced.

All in all I prefer this game to Anno 1503 and can recommended it to anyone who likes the classic catan roll and collect resources!

In its core it's just another Catan-variation but the feel of exploring the unknown and discovering far islands is great. And the setup is much faster than that of the original Catan. These two reasons are sufficient for me to rate Anno higher.

But if you don't like randomness in games - forget this one and play something 'serious'.

This was different and interesting enough to be a new Teuber hit for me. A must buy when the English version is released, although it's possible to be played with German text on the cards. But you need to like the random exploration parts, which don't bother me, but will bother hardcore gamers a lot.

RATING: N/A
Only one play with 2 players, and I think we made a few mistakes so I'm not giving it a rating yet. But right now it it seems to be somewhere near a nine. It's a game very similar to Settlers with seafarers but with a few twists thrown in and if we get everything sorted I think it will work quite nicely both with 2,3&4 players.

This is a rather bizarre Settlers variant, rather reminiscent of Starfarers on a smaller scale. I think I prefer it to Starfarers if only because random geography is less significant and it's much shorter, but sometimes I wish Teuber would just make a new game. (1 play)

Playing this 2007 game in 2016 was interesting. It's one part Catan trading and Seafarers exploration (which I like) and one part "buy buildings that give you special abilities, most of which involve converting resources" (which I find meh). I found it kinda charming, or at least it made me nostalgic.

I liked 1503 enough to buy it.  1701 is directly related, but still different enough to be its own game.  I enjoyed my first game of 1701, but will likely not collect this one.  1503 never gets played (now traded away), and I suspect 1701 would have the same fate.

1701 is nevertheless a very good exploration/economy game.  There seem to be many roads to victory, and the game would offer many hours of entertainment while you figure out what the optimal paths are.

I got to play this twice at the Gathering and loved it both plays. Although it has a lot in common with Anno 1503, it has far more payer interaction and different event cards have been added to give some more spice to the usual exploring and set collection.

Mix between Anno 1503 and Elasund. It has all the good ideas of Anno 1503, different paths to victory, trading phase (what Anno 1503 lacks!) and a much deeper use of the ships.
I was originally afraid of the German text in cards and board elements, but with a good player aid it's not an issue. Really... none at all!

Much better than Anno 1501. I adore exploration games, but this one is outstanding. First, there is this ingenious player board: you get resources with every dice roll (much better than in Settlers), but the more you build, the more numbers you have to abandon. On the other hand you get the building's special ability. Second, this race character - who will be the first to achive the victory points. How many buildings am I supposed to build to get the win? Many decisions to make, many ways to go. Just great!

It's more complicated than Settlers, but not as complicated or as long) as the Roman version from last year.As others have said, it blends the ships, exploration and VP mechanism of 1503 with the trading and resource gathering of Settlers, with some Starfarer-like upgrades and a few other bits.Overall, I think it's one of the better Settlers offshoots - but it's not as quick or as simple to play as 1503 was (for many, that'll be a good thing).Language-wise, it's no harder than playing El Grande in German, and it's probably a little easier than Settlers: Cities and Knights in German.  There is reasonably significant language on the event cards, but there are just 4 events and they affect everyone simultaneously.  There is reasonably significant language on the encounter cards, but there are just 5 basic types, and they are also dealt with instantly and openly.  There is some language on some of the building tiles, but it's either decorative or supported by icons where it has a game function.  Overall, it's very similar to Pillars of the Earth in terms of the language; some people won't bat an eyelid, others will groan and find something else to play.

This game is similar to "The settlers" but there are many additional features. You never know which buildings the other players have unless they build them. When you've got enough ships you can easily discover new land and resources. With cannons you can beat pirates to earn gold. Doesn't every settler-player dream of this? (san)

Nice Settlers spin-off. We don't really get the Anno feel since this game skips one of the more interesting gameplay element of the video game that is to create an industry and produce finished goods. Here, we're just awarded resources pretty much at random. 
Still, the exploration part is nice, the town management is ok but it could have been deeper but heh, it's a Settlers game.
Nice enough game, but if I want to play a Settler-ish game, I'd rather play Elasund any day of the week.

Elements are all familiar from Settlers, Anno 1503 or Starfarers, but are nicely combined.  Starting boards ensure a fair resource spread, but 'Tools' seem overly important.  There's a lot of ways to build up and score. Lots of competition on resource tracks and for positions, but there's a fair amount of points available, so you don't tend to feel "blocked in" like in some Settlers games. This is perhaps the best Settlers variant game; pity it was never released in the US.

My favorite Settlers-like game so far. It does many of the things that Anno 1503 did that I liked, but improves upon that game in several ways, including having more played interaction. I still think there is some room for improvement here - it's a touch long and could possibly use more variability (if there's an expansion I'd like to see numbered chits that you use to customize your board at the start). Also, the graphic design could be better - the icons should be larger, and there are building with the same name and picture that do different things and vice-versa (I realize this is dictated in part by the computer game, but still).

Having said all that, it's still not a game I love, just one I like more than other Settlers games.

Played once (with 4 players). While it doesn't seem to have many new ideas, it is a rather good game with very recognizable bits from Settlers and Anno 1503. The starting individual boards should make it less likely for a player to be stuck behind early on, which is a good thing. My main issue with the game would be its slightly excessive length - that might be better with only 3 players.

This is a good settlers variant.  Not perfect, but a lot of fun and well worth having if you are a settlers fan.  The exploration and discovery is a nice aspect, although the lack of building buildings that produce on the main land is a bit of a let down to other settler variants.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A nice change of pace from the original Settlers of Catan.  I like the added exploration aspect to the game.  However, I don't think the resources are very balanced.  Brick seemed especially useless since they are only required in constructing buildings and you can have at most four of them.  Didn't particularly care for the encounter cards either.  Their presence felt more as a hindrance to prolong rather than enhance the experience.  With the ability to buy and exchange goods yourself, trading between players was almost non-existent.  Decent, but probably not something I feel the need to play very often.

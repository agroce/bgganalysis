In Hotel Life you are the manager of a hotel and need to fulfil the needs of guests so that they stay in your hotel.
However, all guests can be activated and act weird (an opera singer starts to sing from her balcony or military people train house-combat on the tennis-court). All these actions will potentially start chain-reactions because other guests feel harassed or disturbed by the noise.
Those guests then either start their own actions or under circumstances will immediately leave your hotel which costs you reputation.

All in all it is a not so serious game with a good amount of risk/reward decisions. Considering that this was just a game for an advertising campaign and was never in stores, it really stands out (and not just a cheap monopoly-clone).

Definitely an experience game, but a fun one at that!  Life in a hotel can be very unpredictable and random, and the interactions between your guests can be very amusing.  Great game if you don't give a crap about the score and just want to have some fun.

The original ruleset and components are kind of a mess (while also simulatenously being fabulous... a rare feet for sure).  I'd love to see this game get a Deluxe Reissue treatment by some enterprising publisher because, despite its age, it's an excellent and hilarious game.

Its an experiential game, rather than a strategy game. There are some decisions to make, but then stuff...happens. Its fun to play, but not a game I'd need to play more than once a year. I'd love to have access to a copy, but that seems unlikely. Anyway, there were laughs and groans during our one playing. And isn't that always the sign of a good game?

I had never even heard of this game until Jana Nelson asked me to play it while I was attending Tennessee Game Days.  I think the system is very clever, but the rules are extremely clunky, and there are LOADS of situations wherein players must devise their own interpretations of what actually occurs.  The layout of the game is awful, as it is very difficult to discern the occupants and items in each person's hotel.

The system, however, is very clever, and I'd like to see it implemented better and smoother.

So80s! A feast of 80's graphic design. Even the cardboard box-inset is printed in style! Play itself is heavy on cards and a bit fiddly - along the lines: "If this occurs then that and that has to happen" with several knock-on effects. It took too long.

Very entertaining and with a little meat to it too.  Seems to end just as it gets going, but worth a play (if you can find it) just to activate a chain of people and watch the chaos ensue.

I wish this were easier to find, but sadly I suspect my first play was also my last.

RATING: 6
Objectively, this wouldn't get the attention it has if it were published today and it gets overrated here on the Geek. It's a fun game but an odd bird. The limited strategic possibilities should make it a family game. But for family play it is too long, confusing and fiddly. The length and interactions of the cards make it a gamers' game. But for repeated play within a short time period it doesn't offer enough variety. The rules could have done with a bit more development and show some holes. It remains a collector's item that can be played from time to time for its uniqueness.

I'm very happy I got to play this.  I'm also happy I didn't go crazy and try to buy a very expensive copy.  Fun game, but I don't see it enduring very well over repeated play.  As an experience, it was great!  But once was fine, and if I don't get a chanced to play it again, I won't be upset.  If I do, I will enjoy it.  But it isn't a game I must own.

Hotel Life is about Hotels :D. Any of the four players - it should be played by four - competes for the best reputation of their hotels. The first to reach 40 reputation points wins.
Every player gets 20 000 Francs to buy equipment for his hotel. You can buy stuff like bathrooms, TVs, a lift, a tennis court and so on. The better equipped your hotel the more reputation points you get. So, how to get more money to buy more stuff? Easy, you need guests.
Guests are represented by cards, and these guest cards are the core of the game. 
The guests are separated in different groups, as business people, military, sports etc. Each of them is individual, with individual likes and dislikes. The two dice are rolled and an appropriate number of guest cards are layed out.Now the players try to host them in their hotels in order of reputation. But the guests have needs; Scheikh Oily for example needs a tennis court, a sauna, a personal waiter and some more minor stuff. If you´re missing something in your hotel you can´t take him.
When the guests are accomodated we have the action phase. Every player gets some action cards with wich he can activate certain groups of guests and here the fun starts. To give an example: the military is activated. Lieutenant Schiesser arrives at the hotel, totally drunk and making a lot of noise in the whole floor (every floor has three rooms).
Louisa Strong, the famous opera singer, lives on the same floor and feels very offended. In her irritation she starts singing on the balcony, thus offending some guests in the other hotels, who on their part...
A skillful played action card can cause big chain reactions. 
After this the remaining guests pay their rent and a new round starts.
Hotel Life is tremendous fun, requires nevertheless a lot of thinking about the possible outcome of these chain reactions. 
You can wake me up 3AM and 2 hours later I`ll have spoiled your hotel! Fausto rules!

Bought this in rememberance of my grandmother. I still have to play this one. Whenever I look at this game I think of her. I stayed there a lot as a kid.

Finally got to play this on the grand opening of my gameroom.
I think it's a family game and shouldn't be played as a gamer's game. Part of the fun is the action triggering mechanism and all the silly stuff that happens next.
The art is great.
It was kind of hard to play well because a lot of  visitors to the town wanted a tenniscourt. Probably they should be "waved" put in a seperate deck and be mixed by turn two. Did Friedeman Friese use the reversed turnorder stuff from this game ???

RATING: 8
There is a lot of chaos in this game with all the chain reactions, but I would also argue that this is the heart and most enjoyable part of the game (Well, as long as it isn't happening to you!).  Some of the chaos can be mitigated, but not all.  The wide variety of guests can lead to quite a few different twists and turns to the narrative of each of the hotels.  This game should be played with four only.

3-4 players.  Finally got in a play of my copy at Atlanta Game Fest 13 with 3 other players who were willing to bear with me as I tried to teach a game I had never played.  What a great time!  We had to do a little interpretation of the English translation, and I still have questions about a couple of things I'd like to get clarified before the next play.  This is a really unique game that I'm sure gets even better with repeat plays as you learn the effects on the various guest cards and try different ways of upgrading your hotel.  The lead changed a good bit during my first play, and having The Rolling Bones plus a female opera singer in my hotel at endgame gave me the win!  I look forward to getting this great game played a bunch more, and would give it an even higher rating if it played a bit shorter.

A unique experience for sure.  This is a game that has mostly average mechanics and one stand-out...  Guest Reactions are often hilarious, or at least what you would expect for their archetypes.  The board itself is a jumbled mess of 2 color artwork and it took awhile to figure out how to look at things correctly.  With vague rules I must say I wasn't thrilled with the way we interpreted some of the rules, though it all seemed to work out in the end.    It does seem to be a game were the rich will get richer and leaders can only be targeted by what they have for guests.  Im glad I played it and I would love to see a streamlined reprint.

This is a very fun experience game.  It is confusing at first and perhaps a bit long for what it is, but it really is a game that could be seriously enjoyed once a year.  Unfortunately, it is so deeply hard to find that it just isn't worth trying to acquire for how vaguely pleasant it is.  Still, there is a lot of personality in this.  I really enjoy the chain reactions and the interactions of personalities. Plus, upgrading your hotels is fun.  The Tennis courts are damn expensive though.  I'd like to play this again and go in on one with someone right from the start.

It could really use an update.  If this came out I'd snatch it up in a heartbeat.

1 play, with a homemade version. 

This is a very theme-rich game. Each player is managing a hotel, which has 8 rooms with various properties (1st/2nd floor, street/ocean/no view, balcony/none). You can improve the rooms by buying stuff (minibar, TV, extra bed, bath, telephone, etc.); improve the hotel by building stuff (elevator, sauna, tennis court neighboring player adjacent to you) or hiring staff (house doctor, waiter/room service, receptionist). Each turn you reveal 2n guests, each with a different set of attributes (what they do when activated -- usually annoy someone else!, how they react when bothered, when they will checkout -- usually certain conditions + die roll, etc.). In score order, players take guests and put them into rooms. You start the game with a handful of cards (which either change the weather [guests more likely to check out under various conditions], cause an event, or activate a class of guest for all players). In reverse score order, players may play as many cards as they want. Usually this triggers a chain of events: activate athletes --> bother someone, who becomes activated --> bother someone else --> etc. At the end of each round you earn money and VP for guests that are still in your rooms (a few give you VP when they flee, instead!). The game ends when anyone reaches 40VP -- most VP wins.

There are some really interesting ideas here and it seems very thematic. However, the game takes way too long, is awfully fiddly, and is too chaotic/random for its length! With some fine tuning, though, I think this could really be improved and actually be ... playable!

The efforts made to design your hotel properly are *not* inconsiderable. But who cares? One weird card or die roll and your plans are shot to sh*t. Serious brain-sizzling strategy + wild chaos = yuck. One or the other, please.

Quite an experience. We played a German copy with pages of printed translations. Competitive hotel development to attract discerning customers, every one of whom can bring you income, improve (or harm) your reputation (=VP) and have annoying habits which can trigger complaints from guests in your hotel and the hotels of other players.

Experience suggests that focusing on improving reputation from the start (rather than going for income) is necessary because higher reputation hotels attract new customers more often than hotels with poorer reputations. A familiarity with the cards (& the possible traumatic effects) would be valuable for the competitive strategic player, but isn't really necessary - as long as you enjoy setting off some chain reaction of guest complaints that comes back to bite you in the arse.

A game I'd describe as beautiful, with gorgeous & distinctive artwork.

Looking forward to playing a pasted-up English copy (I know someone who has such a thing).

Nothing much to add to the comment of BGG user JoSch. There must be a lot of nostalgia and good will flowing into the ratings. Of course, it has a nice theme and good mechanics, but I think Wucherer (Landlord) does a better job in the category of games to which this one should have belonged. Which is games appealing to families and playable in a short time. But instead with this length, the gaps in the rulebook and with this fiddliness it will most likely only draw the hardcore Gamers to the table.

This extremely rare game has been on my want to play list for years, and I'm ecstatic that I finally got to play it. While not the best game, this was the game that I had the best time playing at bgg.con. I was laughing so hard I was crying during this game.

This is a highly luck driven random "take that" kind of game, so you have to be prepared for that. Essentially, players draft hotel guests, then outfit hotel rooms with things like tv's, bars, phones, etc that those guests demand. Players than play cards which cause chain reactions amongst the guests.

For example, on my turn I might play "Activate Musicians" to cause havoc for all the player that have musicians. We then look at each musician the players have, and see how they react to being activated. A musician's card might say 'Starts practicing their trombone, bothering everyone else on the same floor'. So this generates a new event of Bothering, so we look at all the affected guests in the hotel to see how they respond to being bothered. They might check out of the hotel, start a fight, trash their room, leave without paying, etc. At the end of the round income and points are earned, and the next round begins.

The chain reactions can lead to outright hilarity, as I mentioned above. One player lost his receptionist, and had a guest trash his room just as a homeless guy appeared amongst the guests. This meant the homeless guy snuck into his hotel and took up residence. He tried and tried to do everything he could to cause an event to kick the homeless guy out, but nothing would work.

Another player negotiated with me to pay $12,000 while I only paid $8,000 to jointly build a tennis court, so we could both house guests that required it (which is a *ton* of money in this game). Not five minutes later his guest got kicked out, and he got nothing from his tennis court. Meanwhile, my guest just loved the tennis court, and I earned a ton of money and points from it.

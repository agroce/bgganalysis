A very bare-bones two-player filler. Extremely portable and is said to capture the back and forth of dueling very well.  I wouldn't know, but there's certainly a lot of back and forth and trying to judge how close to get to your opponent!  A lot of game in just a few cards.

To my surprise, I found En Garde is a good game: maybe it’s a bit too fiddly and dry when exploited to its basic mechanics (as my opponents usually do) but still quite enjoyable, mostly thanks to its quick pace, easy rules and, above all, its unusual theme, which unexpectedly meshes pretty well with the overall gameplay. (May 2012)

[b]Update[/b] - After neglecting it for some time, recently I’ve played En Garde intensively again and appreciated its simplicity and theme even more than I used to: thus, in May 2014 I’ve raised my rating from 6 to 7.

RATING: 5
Not much to this. Luckily its quick.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Gameplay is dry & fairly simple.  The fencing theme fits well, as there is a lot of back-and-forth action until someone gets backed into the wall.  You must know the deck distribution and count cards (at least some of the numbers)... otherwise, your opponent will have the upper hand and you will lose.  In the end, you are still at the mercy of the draw deck (luck), even if you count cards well.  The game just doesn't do much for me.  There are much better 2p games out there.

Ferti Edition
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
One of Reiner Knizia's greatest games. A game that's game mechanics actually capture the feel and theme of fencing, a great plus. And a great 2 player game, which is surprisingly spouse approved! It's easy to learn and a light strategy game that isn't to convoluted with rules, there's only one or 2 small confusions when playing the advanced rules when including retreating.

 Be wary if you play against a card counter, since this game greatly involves numbers, distance/moving, calculating what your opponent may hold and a bit of math. The travel version is the best. I bring this one with me a lot, wherever I go with family, parties and vacation.

I highly suggest this game to start off the evening or just a light fun distraction with a cup of coffee or after meal dessert!

Light, easy filler that can be played with almost everyone. Knizia's apparent fondness for interminable back-and-forth stalemates (Blue Moon, Times Square) is not only made into a thematic element here (fencing) but is also mitigated by a timing device (limiting your cards every round). I play the iOS version all the time now, so this doesn't make it to the table much.

RATING: 4
Too luck-driven.  The advanced game is the only way to play, and it still isn't worth playing.  The only reason I don't rate this lower is because the mechanics match the theme so well and the game only takes 15 minutes to play.  So while I'll never suggest it, I might play it with someone else if they really love it.

A lot more to think about than apparent straight away, though far from complicated.  Though it's short & sweet there's a real build up of tension as the cards deplete, along with a real pressure to maneuvre your way to making a decisive attack. The basic game is, indeed, too basic but is a good way to introduce the game.  The standard game is great though, and the advanced game is well worth working up to.  Rather nicely presented too, though the score tracks need a zero.

Another of the average to mediocre Knizia small-box games, this one works better than most and does OK on the theme front. Didn&#039;t blow me away - I liked Clash of the Lightsabres better - but definately OK, which is getting to be better than expected for small-box stuff from Knizia.

RATING: 4.5
I despised this game from the first round... and I am normally one to give games lots of tries before I decide I don't like it.  (and I like almost everything)  It seemed like you either have the cards or you don't.  If you don't, there isn't anything you can do.

The version I played had the mat made out of individual cards which was annoying because they kept slipping around.  It should have been one piece like I see some other people have.

I think this is the only game I have played so far that I wouldn't voluntarily play again.

RATING: 6.5
Just as with a real fencing match, the key in this simple card game is knowing how close to get to your opponent, when to attack and when to retreat.  An attack is a card that would touch your opponent if you're in range, which can then be parried with an equal card.  But if you don't have defense to back up an immediate counter-attack - it hurts!

Really easy to learn but much tougher to play.  This is a great choice for 2 players that like a light, fast game.

Ferti edition, which is about the most overproduced version of a game like this you could imagine. I absolutely dig it, but it's a bit like playing pinochle with hand-carved ivory cards. ;-) (Actually, it's more akin to buying the "uber-chrome deluxe foldout 3-d cover" edition of a comic book at 3x the price of the regular version of the same issue. While I usually avoid doing that, sometimes it's just worth the splurge. This edition is that for me.)

Clever Reiner Knizia game themed on fencing.  Players play cards to advance, retreat and attack their opponent.  Three ways to play, but you really should move right into the "advanced" game that incorporates the move and attack option.  Excellent little filler that rewards tracking the 25 cards and trying to psych out your opponent. It is quite astonishing what this designer can do with a deck of cards!  The Ferti editions are gorgeous and really bought me back to this gem of a filler.

A quick 2 player hand management filler with great components. It's fiddly, you're constantly moving your hands from you cards to your figure. I haven't figured out yet how to mitigate the luck of the card draw so maybe it's less strategic than I want it to be.

Simple but engaging filler that very interestingly recreates the feeling of a a sword duell. You really need to play with the "combined move+attack" rule of En Garde which, for no apparent reason, has been omitted from Duell. Didn't try the event card, and I dont think they would add anything.

From the cover: "In this two-player game, tactics, skill, and a little bit of luck will determine the best fencer. Strategically rich yet easy to learn and play".
The only thing that is true, is that it is easy to learn and play, dont' believe the rest.
If you really have gamers trying this, they will be wholeheartedly disappointed. There ist not much of a game in this box, since both player wouldn't make a mistake it's the luck of the card draw that decides the winner. It's nicely produced but neither basic rules nor advanced rules makes much of game. Sadly it's a waste of time of point of view of a gamer. Maybe non gamers may enjoy it as they do not perceive the mechanics/mathematics of En Garde. One of Knizia weakest titles.

Upon more playing, I've decided I like this one quite a bit. It's quick and fun, but still strategic. There are three basic rule sets: basic, regular, and advanced. I think regular is definitely the best way to go. I've tried advanced, and it added more options, but didn't really add to the fun.

A really fun yet simple game of fencing. Each player plays a card or cards to advance and attack their opponent. The attacked can either parry or retreat. Whoever hits or advances farther by the end of the round gets a point. Five points make a game.

I really enjoy the Gryphon Games edition. Although the box is a little large for the components, the over-sized cards and metal figures make it worth it. UPDATE: I'm less enamored with this edition as the cards favor artwork over utility. I wish they had used a better font.

I've been enjoying this little 2-player game since the mid-1990s when it was released by Abacus Spiele in a small card box.  En Garde is a fun, fast and engaging two-player game that has stood the test of time, at least in terms of today's game market where games have a short shelf life.  It has been around since 1993, and hasn't lost any of its luster.  This new, more attractive version makes it even more appealing.  Hopefully, the game will find an even wider audience who will get to enjoy the challenge of fencing -- without the bruises!

Knizia's genius is making shockingly interesting (and agonizing!) decisions emerge from drop-dead simple math, and En Garde is probably the finest example of that. Card-counting is a must, but it's relatively easy. The new Ferti edition is amazingly attractive.

An illustration of the fact that gaming can be at its best when reduced to pure minimalism, this simple card game is a surprisingly atmospheric recreation of the sport of fencing. You could argue that winning is all luck, but you can mitigate the luck using card counting and probability. Plenty of fun and the pewter miniatures in the Gryphon edition are great.

En Garde falls into the "barely a game" category for me.  There's a huge advantage in going first, the card draw makes or breaks you, and all the strategies are more than obvious.  I don't understand how games like Sorry and Connect Four get trashed and everyone then turns around and loves this equally stupid, empty game.  Oh wait, those are American made Milton Bradley games and this one is a Reiner Knizia, oooohhh.  There's nothing here!

Oh wow, how I love this game. It may not be that deep but to see the two fencing figures dancing back and forth across the board, it makes you think that it is really happening. When you are attacked can you parry? Or can you even parry and thrust? Must you advance or retreat? Lots of fun.

Simple, elegant rules that generate several possible strategies, direct conflict, bluffing, quick setup and play, and just enough luck to keep things interesting. Only issue is that it's exclusively two players.

Sold on eBay because I bought Flash Duel. Still think it's a great game, and superior to Flash Duel in some ways, but I can't really justify having both, and Flash Duel is more likely to be played.

On further reflection, my preference for the original won out. I'll probably track it down at some point.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (February 2012)

A decent light 2 player game, my girlfriend likes it a lot I believe. I have only played it once and I liked it BUT I feel the game has little replay value so it is not a game I would like to play often. A friend gifted it to me and I have not played it because I haven’t been able to find sleeves for this game (YES I´m that anal with my games :D). I just recently bought some Mayday sleeves that fit the game so I will be playing it soon. 

The components are very good, the miniatures are gorgeous, perhaps a little overproduced for a simple game like this, but gorgeous nonetheless. The art is adequate. 

Its forte is that En Garde is very easy to learn and teach making it perfect to play with nongamers. Also its theme FITS with the mechanics which almost never happens in a Knizia game. :D

You have some room for decisions and there is some tension in them but overall I feel the game has a lot of luck of the draw, which I don’t mind because it plays very quickly.

Due to its simplicity I prefer to play Balloon Cup or Schotten-Totten (Battle Line) but I will play it soon to form a better opinion. I have not played with the advance game rules but I suspect the game is not meaty enough for my taste.

The Ferti version is ridiculously overproduced and is pretty difficult to assemble.  Once assembled, I don't want to take it apart since it is so difficult to put together.  It looks nice, though.

The game itself is very clever and feels remarkably thematic, coming from someone that knows nothing about fencing.  It's still a standard Knizia numbers game, but it plays quickly and is fun for a quick 2-player game.

A light, repetitive game with a superficial thematic resemblance. Superior card counting will decide matches in the long run, but I would prefer a little more than that.

The Good: A short game that would make a great 2-player filler while waiting for others to arrive. I was worried that it would be too simple - but fortunately, there are advanced rules that can be added. The rule book does a great job of presenting advanced rules by allowing you to teach people the basic rules, then intermediate, then advanced. The pewter figures are an unexpected bonus !

The Bad: Not a deep strategic game, and there is the luck of the draw - so stay away if thoses things bother you. I would say it is more of almost a bidding game (that is not a bad point - just trying to clarify what it is).

A lovely 2 player game, plays in 15 minutes and is all about bluff and bravado. There is a bit of card counting but as there are only 25 cards it is not too difficult.
It is not everyones cup of tea, but I think its fun. Be aware though that the later versions come with the playing area made from extra cards in the deck. this is the naff version, bits of the playing area move as you move your pieces each turn. The original version came with a rolled pseudo-leather like board, this is the one you want.

One of my earliest Euros, and another earlier Knizia that shows his genius. A linear board, two pawns, and a deck of 25 cards (5 each of 1-5)--that's it!

A nice, quick game with a simple rules set that's great fun. We have one house rule - if someone throws down, for example, three fives, the other player has to match the number of cards in order to retreat, otherwise no-one would ever score a hit because one player could play five fives and the other player could lay down a single one to retreat, which seems over-powered.

Despite this, it's a great little game, its only limitation being it's two-player only.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Every now and again a game grabs me for a silly reason, and in this case is how simply the game gathers up the theme and vomits it all up in a simple system designed to praise a well timed thrust while totally punishing overextending.  I know the game is kinda lame in the age of hordes of minis, card specific rules, and is really about deduction and card counting, but throwing a huge thrust and missing leaves a player feeling off kilter, and that one moment is very cool because it just feels right. 

With that said, BattleCon has the exact same moments, with a deeper and more varied experience, and while En Garde is still very fun, I find myself reaching past it to grab BattleCon whenever I can spare the extra minutes.

Reiner's best game (played with the advanced rules).  Really.  25 cards numbered 1-5, very simple rules, and yet I always come away thinking "If only..." - sheer genius in its' simplicity!

Aside: just played the new edition by Ferti.  It's a triumph of engineering, and I like the miniature fencers; whatever alloy they have chosen seems to be carefully selected to keep the swords intact - very impressed by how springy they are. However, I think the whole idea is over the top.  A cloth mat would have done just as well, and who wants to spend 10 minutes building the stage when the game only lasts for about 15 minutes.

I couldn't believe a card game could imitate fencing so closely - but Knizia's nice little card-counting exercise En Garde does that very nicely!

RATING: 10
One of Knizia's greatest small games, stunning for its economy of means and thematic match for fencing. Wish it came with a couple fencer figurines. The basic and intermediate games are interesting, but the full game is best of all. I love the austerity of the original [i]En Garde[/i], so much better than its swashbuckler reincarnation [i]Duell[/i]. The [i]En Garde[/i] app works well and is very fun, especially against the tougher AI fencer Crazai. Count those cards! [61 ftf plays, dozens more with the app]

En garde! So simple:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, times five.
Touché Doctor K!

Another great Reiner game. 

This time you are dueling in a fencing match.

You use the number cards to move, attack and parry.

Give it go if you like Reiner Knizia games.

The basic game is actually really fun too..

As a fencer, I had to get it. And it does a great job of simulating the back-and-forth of a fencing match. "Is he inviting me to attack so he can parry-riposte? Or is he hoping I'll take a step back so he can strike?" Very simple game, but lots of fun.

Update: Owned Abacus, now Ferti

Knizia strikes again with ANOTHER underrated game!  So simple, so deft, but so fun!  I think my only problem--if it can possibly can be called a problem--is that after a close game of this equaling about nine rounds, you won't be in the mood to play it again immediately.

Very interested to see what the new version looks like!

Always room for Jell-O? Well, there's always time for En Garde. Simple to play and fast-paced, this game has stood the test of time in my collection and is #1 on my list of games to take when I travel. It is easy to teach and played over the course of 5-9 brief rounds, so players don't ever feel locked into the game.  
My edition is the original boxed version with the cloth board, so it has a substantial aesthetic advantage over more recent editions, but the game is solid regardless of which edition you pick up.
I have never turned down a game of En Garde in the decade or so that it's been in my collection and I never will.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Light but very refreshing tactical game of tug-of-war where the topic, usually just a dressing in Rainer Knizia's games, fits like a glove. There's a healthy dose of skill in the game, but its short length and a style of play easily more effective than any other detract a bit from the variety of the game. Nevertheless, En Garde's clean cut stands out: Knizia had been perfecting the mechanisms under the surface (using cards for moving forwards and backwards or attacking) during the previous years (check his book "Neue Taktikspiele..."), and by retouching the winning conditions and adding a way to parry attacks he simply rounded it off.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Quick, easy to learn card-game. Maybe I'm rotten at bluffing, but it seems to me that aspect is over-emphasised. Not something I would play over and over, but it is a pleasant 2-P filler.

RATING: 8
If you're looking for a quality 10-15 minute game for 2 players, it's hard to beat this. The mechanics match the theme beautifully, with the forwards / backwards cut and thrust providing a nice feel of fencing. There's a nice micro-bluff element as you move forward into the strike zone, attempting to lure your opponent into an attack at a range where you may have more of the cards of that range number. The essence of the game is attempting to continually move to a range where you have the advantage (ie more cards in that number), counting the cards as they're played so you have a feel for the range where your opponent might be stronger, avoiding that as much as your cards let you. The usual strategy is to drive out with your 5's and pray for 1's to be able to continually force your opponent onto the back foot. This strategy has maybe made it perhaps a little one dimensional over time and through much replay - at some point I should probably move up and try the advanced lunge version - but for a short game, there's a lot to enjoy here.

Essen 2006 went by and still: NO GAME! I think I will make my own "homemade" version of it
Essen 2007: Finally the game is available by a French company. But the game is overproduced and much to expensive!
Come on: This game needs a real edition!

Bleah.  Enthusiasts celebrate how closely the game matches actual fencing.  I disagree, as all the joy of fencing is in the close-action sword play, the dozens of maneuvers and approaches available -- all this game offers is distance management, and that inaccurately (since when do I have a limitted number of times I can advance or retreat?).  Utterly misses the point of fencing, and doesn't stand on its own.

Cool game, that has a good combo of ability to card count, with some degree of luck involved, meaning the game is not deterministic all the time, but the best player will win over many plays. It is really quick and the components are very pretty. I should carry this around for whenever an opportunity to get a quick two player presents itself. This could get old if overplayed though.

RATING: 6
One of those bare-bones Knizia card games (like Loco or Yin Yang) with a small deck (5 each of the values 1 to 5) and minimal rules. But unlike most of those, it has an integral theme. I've never fenced, but this certainly captures the feel of a movie swordfight - thrusts, parries, counterattacks, retreats. Ludicrously for a game of this weight, it comes with basic, standard and advanced rules, but I can't see why you'd want to play any way but advanced.

No a bad little game for Knizia. Descent filler. Surprisingly the way it plays feels very similar to a fencing match with the ebb and flow of movement, the attacking, the lucky strike. A nice little filler with really nice components in the original 93 version with the pewter pieces. Could use a first player marker. Components and production quality was top notch.

I have an OCD desire to see if the 'poorly rated' wargames are really that bad, so....

Basic game was mostly about staying out of possible harms way until the end of the board require a desperate move. Card counting (not terrible difficult, only 5x5) doesn't really change this too much and isn't really worth the effort. The intermediate game didn't improve matters for me.

RATING: 4
Hard to actually find a comprehensive list of differences between En Garde and Flash Duel after you filter out the rip-off/variant comments. Here's what I gathered:

- En Garde has a longer board (24 spaces vs 18), so more posturing beforehand
- Can move or retreat 'up to' # of spaces if would go past the opponent or the edge of the board, so more ways to get artificially screwed
- Can push in Flash Duel, so harder to get artificially screwed
- Hidden discards in En Garde to artificially screw you; feel free to ignore
- En Garde is Best 5-of-9, Flash Duel is Best 3-of-5, again pick whatever you want

I love the integration of the fencing theme in here. But for all intents and purposes, this game resembled more of a mechanical exercise/demonstration, and was 90% there. Sirlin added the remaining 10% with his tweaks in Flash Duel, then blew it out of the water 1000000% with new characters and game modes.

I like the idea in the Variants of retheming this as a Star Wars light saber duel, adding moves like Force Push, Force Pull, Force Choke etc, and of course adding Jedi vs. Sith characters.

RATING: 7
Clever little card game. Players draw a starting hand of 5 cards from a pool of 25 (5 each of numbers 1-5). Each turn, they play a card to advance or retreat their fencer.

If you land on the exact square your opponent is on, you score a hit. If the draw pile runs out, the most forward player wins the round. First to 5 wins. You can also supplement your hit and prevent a parry by playing multiple identical cards to score a hit. IE: If playing a four to advance score a hit, your opponent could parry if they play a four. You could play 2 x 4 card and the opponent could parry if they had 2 x 4 card.

Simple game where you need to carry a nice range of cards to offer flexibility in the event where you can't move forward and don't want to have to play a high number card to move backwards. 

There are 8 special effect cards which can be used, on per round but I feel they detract from the simple elegance of the base game.

The Duell version has better pieces and a board.

Prefer Flash Duel, but the heart of the gameplay actually feels more different than people think, despite Flash Duel being an obvious re-molding. 

En Garde is dry, and after a few games feels like an exercise, but there is some strategy here that isn't present in Flash Duel 2nd ed and vice versa, and it has to do with the differences in how movement works and the length of the track -- both of which change the values of the numbered cards, and in En Garde you usually approach your opponent with more information about his hand due to enlarged distance, whereas Flash Duel gets to the action faster.

Hidden discard "rule", as usual, is complete trash -- Sirlin has it right on this one. -1 point to design.

[Improvised a set from a Phase 10 deck, some dominoes for the piste, and glass stones for the pawns and scoring counters]

A tight little game.  The mechanics and theme feel perfectly matched.  Even with my improvised, themeless set, it feels like a duel.

Good: I love Knizia's minimalistic designs and this is no different. The rules are incredibly simple, but there is quite a lot of tactics that can be employed. The theme works marvellously; you really feel like you are fencing.

Bad: There is a lot of luck in this game, but since it's so short, you can just play again!

A short and simple game. When I say short, I mean short...like 5 minutes tops. Great to play on the tray table of an airplane. Although, be careful about taking the stainless-steel swordsman through security. The swords are pretty sharp and will probably set off the metal detector. I suggest leaving them at home and taking two black and two white wooden cubes.

RATING: 9
A solid 8 after 30 plays.

I have the Ferti 3D version so I'll start by saying that they did a good job with this.  The "stage" does add something to the game.  It fits together pretty well, but I did find I needed to use clips to keep the foot of the stairs flat.  Not a big deal.   

The pewter minis are really beautiful.  They look great, but the swords are very bendy, which leads into part of my "problem" with the production:  It will not travel well.

I like this game a lot and I love to travel, so I will need to make/buy a travel version.  The travel Ferti and Gryphon travel versions also look very nice so you may want to consider those when purchasing.  It may not be worth seeking the 3D version out if you plan to take En Garde with you and I don't think it is worth paying a lot extra for it.

Noew to the game itself.  I love it.  I compare it favorably with Knizia's other fast-playing two-person games LOTR: Confrontation, Battleline and Times Square.

I enjoy all of these games for the depth of strategy in a small package that plays in 30 minutes or less.  En Garde feels like each of those games because there are a limited number of choices, but the choices almost always create tension.  Your always thinking "What does she have in her hand?" Or "Should I play this in the hopes that I can play this next?" Or "Why did he play that?"

En Garde also has about the same ratio of luck-to-skill as those others (LOTR probably relies on more skill and Times Square may rely on more luck, but they are close).

And like those other games, En Garde sits in a nice place of fun and thinking that is perfect for a filler.

I would also suggest that one play with the Advanced Rules as I think the Move+ Indirect Attack adds a good option that allows you to make a useful, but risky play when you don't like your cards or board position. 

Update:  A solid 9 for me after 6 or 7 more plays.  I am slightly addicted to this game.  I had my pewter minis painted.  This is a great marriage of theme to mechanics and never fails to feel like a sword fight.  It is just plain fun.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 4
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 4
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 2
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4


Overall - 4

Unfortunately, on my first setup/play, part of the board got torn, so it's taped together and sits slightly uneven, but it still works and is cool to look at.

RATING: 7
An old Knizia game from 1993 that I'd been meaning to try for many years now, but had never had the opportunity until recently. It's a clever game of playing numbered cards, just like we've come to expect from Knizia. Like Lost Cities, En Garde combines a dose of hand management, probability estimates, and reading your opponent's mind. It's quick and simple, yet provides some agonizing decisions that you'll inevitably regret. While I believe it's hard to track down a copy these days, it seems like an obvious choice for couples who enjoy Lost Cities and Knizia's design style in general.

After reading the (short) manual, I was not expecting much from this game. When I was finally about to play it, I expected a dry, number-crunching Knizia classic. However, it turned out to be quite thematic! En Garde is all about strategic positioning, riding the odds, bluffing, pushing your luck and just a little memory. It is also quite random, but there is still sufficient control, especially if you pay attention to the cards that leave the game from the moment the fencers approach each other. I do recommend playing for 3 instead of 5 victories - the game might run a little long otherwise.

A nice, quick, lite fencing simulation.  Your goal is to hit your opponent or force him/her back to their home space.  You do this by playing cards.  You have 3 choices, play 1 card to move forward/backward, 2 play 1 card to move forward/backward and more cards to attack, play 1 or more cards to attack.  In the first type of attack, your opponent can parry by playing the same number of cards or play 1 card to back up.  In the second type of attack, you must play the same number of the same type of cards as your opponent.  First person to win 5 matches is the winner.

A Knizia game that some claim actually manages to capture its theme.

It doesn't. It has about as much to do with fencing as Lost Cities has to do with an Indiana Jones adventure.

Of course, some claim that Lost Cities does a good job of capturing its Indiana Jones style theme as well.

They're stupid.

I have to say that En Garde is one of my favorite games. Simple, brilliant, and it's a wonder how well the mechanics capture the spirit and feel of real fencing. (This is for the original Abacus edition -- I really don't care for the dumbed-down Ravensburger rules, and I don't know what Ferti has done with the game.)

I sometimes wonder whether Knizia starts his design process by punching unfamiliar buttons on his calculator.  

Hmmm, I wonder what this one does...

Update:

After briefly revisiting the rules, I now remember the reason for my harsh rating.  The rules, as written, are unintelligible.

I can't speak for the updated rules in later versions, but in the original it's impossible to tell whether certain actions are "response" actions that count as being played on your opponent's turn, or whether these actions are "real" actions that take up your own turn.  This is a fundamental editing and clarity problem that any playtester would have caught.

The Ferti 3D Board version is gorgeous! I glued together my 3D scenery as it becomes so much more stable then. It now sits as a crown on top of one of my bookcases.

En Garde is one of my favorite games. You easily play a full best-of-9 games in under 30 minutes, and each duel is highly tense and captures the feel of fencing in a wonderful manner. This is certainly one of the best if you like 1-on-1 fighting games.

We used the components from the Duell but played with the En Garde ruleset.  The standard game was followed but we did not observe the ending condition when the draw deck was exhausted (at leat not the part where the distance travelled down the board as the determination of who wins the round, we just made it a draw if no one can play any more cards to advance or retreat).

In any case, En Garde isn't a terrible game, but seems awfully predictable.  If you have 3+ more cards of a certain value in your hand, it becomes pretty much impossible to get into that position to attack because there is no way your opponent would put himself in that range.  I imagine the advanced version of advance and attack would remedy that problem, but as it is this game is dry and not very exciting.

I bought it because I am  fencer.  Thought it was kind of boring.
Tried it again.  Worse than I remembered.  Few real options.  You either have the cards to parry or you don't.  If the attack is 3 cards it doesn't matter.  I'll keep it because of the theme but that is all.

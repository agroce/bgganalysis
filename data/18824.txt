GAME: WWE Raw Deal
RANK: 4711

RATING: 7
A very quick, clever and fun CCG, with almost the same flavor as the WWE shows :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
+ Engaging (if not campy) theme; Lots of card combinations to explore.
- It's a CCG, so you have to find willing partners/participants; It's hard to get enough cards to build truly different decks.

RATING: 5
Comme la plupart des CCG (Collective card game), celui qui dépense le plus gros pour son deck a plus de chance de remporter. Je suis totalement contre ce concept. 

L'idée au départ était bonne, les manœuvres de lutte faisait du dégât a l'adversaire et le deck représentait l'énergie du lutteur. Vous pouviez le monter Gentil ou Méchant selon vos manœuvres. 

Malheureusement , vient un moment ou l'on sort une série trop débalancée par rapport aux autres(ou qui avantage certain lutteur (euse). On perd beaucoup de joueurs. Le jeu fini par crashé, les cartes ne valent plus rien....

RATING: 8
Amazing card game. Managed to capture the feeling of wrestling. I still have my cards from the base set and the first two expansions. We had a nice little group of dedicated players, willing to get into the mood, trash talking and everything.

Used to be at least a 9 for me, but I don't play it anymore.

I forgot that I had this CCG in my collection.  I'm an off again, on again pro wrestling fan so this should've worked for me but I found the card text to be too long and convoluted.  I remember only playing once with my buddy and a random 10 year old kid; we agreed to play with a regular starter deck (no boosters, no deck building).  The kid proceeds to school us with Trish Stratus as he pulls bulldog after bulldog out of his deck... the little cheat!

RATING: 7
A solid CCG. Very playable right out of the decks. Recommended for wrestling fans. Despite the solid gameplay, it probably won't appeal to non wrestling fans.
I wish I would have gotten into this game back when it was actually "around". I mean I hate collectable games as much as the next person, but I wouldn't have minded getting into this one at least a little bit.

RATING: 10
My CCG of choice. I was ranked 5th in the UK and was a local manager for the game, running tournaments each month in Shire Games - Stoke-on-Trent. It is a 10 ranking due to the people it has put me in contact with since it was released that have become the greatest of friends. Now the game seems to be waning under the weight of cards but I am running a revival tournament to get the game back in the mix again after a lenghty break and it has been taken up again by all the players who enjoyed the game before. 1130 Plays

RATING: 8
Really simulates the back and forth of pro-wrestling, but it also does a good job of simulating the occasional stomp match.

A lot more interesting than a lot of other CCG's due to being so different to MtG.  Havent yet encountered someone else who actually plays it

Co-designer of the game, so I'm biased! Sorry, but I think it's a good game. Plus, how many CCG's were around for 8 plus years like WWE Raw Deal? Lots of unopened starters for trade... make me an offer. I can dig up foils too for whomever you need.

RATING: 8
Surpasses its source material in cleverness.  A surprisingly fun game that captures that zany atmosphere and dramatic comebacks inherent to a professional wrestling match.  The various wrestlers are wildly unbalanced (who would have guessed that Dude Love was such a monster?), but the basic gameplay mechanics are an addictive treat.  The later additions of pre-match cards and mid-match actions and [insert bad card type gimmick here] were pretty lame, but also completely optional.

One of the better CCGs on the market, it is well designed and very enjoyable.  Even if you aren't a wrestling fan, there is plenty to like about this one.


EDIT:  Man, they are really running this game into the toilet with their current sets.  Worth collecting up to and possibly including Survivor Series 3, but no more than that.  We've just stopped buying and will play with what we own already.

I once received a full box of this game for free. I played it once and was turned off completely. To play the game properly, you must have a hand full of about 15 to 20 cards! I eventually gave the cards away. I didn't want to waste my time selling the things.

Ratings depend on which cards you played with.  This was a great CCG.  At certain points in the card cycle, i would have rated it a 10.

Raw Deal is the first "Direct action" CCG to ever be published that works. Else, it would only be possible through non-collectible CG. There are interesting ideas like the deck which is your life bar (an idea I kept for my games). The game play fast, and I know that there have been a lot of improvement in new versions that I had not a chance to try yet. So I would need to play the new version to place a better review. The first version was good, but there was something missing to make the game flow perfectly.

This was a CCG that I and my roomies in college would play almost every night.  I was skeptical of a wrestling CCG too, but the game was very enjoyable until they did a reboot that killed it.  Even now when all of us get together, we pull out a few decks and play for old times sake.

RATING: 7
Best CCG of 2000. ( Despite the Origins Best CCG Award going to *gack* Sailor Moon.) Cool and  Innovative CCG mechanics for the time. Very fun game.

2-11-2009 Bumped rating one point to "7" Superb game, still compelling after years away from active tournament scene/local play group and new cards. 


Clever mechanics capture the essence of a match rather well. Individual superstars are often well done and have varied abilities that create a wide range of deck archetypes and uniquely interesting, uniquely fun decks. 

Deck building is a hoot.

RATING: 6
Possibly the best tabletop wrestling game out there. Very reminiscent of WWF With Authority! Still a little slow-paced and swingy by today's standards, but the game is over pretty quickly. There definitely seems to be some power creep also, but the game is fun for what it is.

Try and deck your opponent by using the popular pro wrestling moves. Fun for a little while, but no keeper unless you can't live a day without a little 'Rocky' (in which case you should just watch his movies).

RATING: 8
Pound for pound, probably one of the most entertaining CCGs and the one that got the best table-talk at tournaments (I used to enjoy hosting these much more than then sullen and serious M:TG tourneys). I still hold a few decks, but find it hard to get people to play. Source: Ex bottom-five ranked tournament player (Yesss!).

RATING: 9
Based rating of game on its start through about  its 4'th or 5'th expansion. Large local player base and active tournaments plus my interest in WWF programming meant I played this multiple times a week. As the game matured and attempted to keep up with WWF/WWE programming it began to introduce overly complicated mechanics and they began to recycle cards. Left game(about '05) well before the end but in its early days it was the one & only CCG I truly enjoyed. Let collection go in game purge of '10.

RATING: 10
Being a wrestling fan this game appealed due to the fact that there is no other wrestling game that I played that simulates the action in a wrestling ring. Getting the option to play as your favorite character(s) is a blast as each character has their own special abilities that gives the player a feel for how to play and feel as the character(s) in a WWE ring. A must for any wrestling fan!!!

the mechanics actually work fairly well - but the theme, um, sucks.

RATING: 5
This is where the rating system breaks down.  Some of the design concepts are brilliant - the way escalation and comeback are built into the game, the accessible pocket of cards (Backlash deck), etc.  Unfortunately, the sheer weight of metagame nonsense means your decks are useless after every new expansion, and far too many of the cards are broken or worthless.

RATING: 7
I played this when I was 14 for 3-4 months before moving on to the Lord of the Rings TCG. I played the first 3 sets (Raw Deal, Fully Loaded, Backlash). This was really, really fun, as the wrestling theme lends itself very well to the dueling, fortitude and backstage/storyline mechanisms. I really like how you take damage by shelling out cards from your deck, and you get pinned when your deck runs out. Different superstars with different, very thematic abilities add a unique flavor to each deck. Every component of a pro wrestling match is conveyed beautifully in the theme, from face/heel status, pre-match pyros and entrances, to dirty low blows, technical submissions, high-flying maneuvers into tables, backstage interference, signature taunts and more.

The catch? The people who played this game were complete dorky assholes with burrito breath, sweaty hands and filthy mouths. No offense to you Raw Deal fans reading this, but the chances of encountering a fucked-up asshole while playing Raw Deal is orders of magnitude higher than when you play any other trading card game. They ruined the game for me. But have yourself some good opponents and this game is a gem (huge costs notwithstanding).

[url=http://rawdeal.netfirms.com/]Check out an incomplete Raw Deal website I made when I was 13[/url]. I built a Triple H deck first, then evolved it into the hot new Two Man Power Trip (Triple H + Stone Cold) deck after the release of the trash can promos. I also built an X-Pac deck for fun (since he was widely reviled as the weakest superstar), then built an Edge deck for my third deck. My best friend and co-conspirator at the time started with a Mankind deck that kicked my Triple H way too often, then built a Christian deck to complement my Edge. We often combined our forces into an Edge & Christian deck. We shared the cost of the trash can, and he got to build a Brothers of Destruction (Undertaker & Kane) out of it. The catalyst for our getting out of the game was he went on vacation, stored his cards with me, and they got drenched and ruined in a terrible rainstorm. He didn't blame me too much since he is super-rich after all, but it did provide him with the excuse to exit the scene, which he had been advocating for a while. I followed suit, and we went on to Lord of the Rings.

I got a lot of my other classmates into this too, since they were huge pro-wrestling fans. Decks my friends cooked up included a formidable Kane control deck and a Chris Benoit aggro deck that seemed really invincible to us until I finally figured how to beat it (he quit the game shortly after; retirement match!).

3+4

It's a good game that captures wrestling pretty well.  Unfortunately, the cards are incredibly wordy and that slows the game down a good bit.

Picked up a Trish Stratus starter deck in a bargain bin on a lark. Haven't played yet.

Update: Picked up a second starter (Chyna) so I can actually play it now.

Update 2: Picked up a few more starters on Ebay for a good price: Stacy Keibler, Lita, Trish Stratus, Right to Censor, Sable, and Torrie Wilson.

Game started with such promise, but way to big starting hands, too many reversals, and broken cards made this game nearly unplayable towards the end. Traded away. May have half a dozen cards in scattered boxes.

RATING: 5.5
Having had this recommended to me, big stylee,  I was keen to dive straight in and it has some good comedy moments. However, maybe it’s me or the instruction I was given but after 3 hours of play I remained non plussed as to the long term appeal.

Sure if you play with the right people the interaction is great, but play with the wrong un’s and it’s time miserably spent. For me great games spark interaction between the players even when they are polar opposites in character and Raw Deal doesn’t do this. With so many other great games that can make up for lacklustre play mates I just can’t give Raw Deal anymore than a 5.5.

I’ll be giving it another go soon, so I haven’t given up on it yet, so I’ll review my comments then.

I have no interest in Professional Wrestling. I have been told the key to understanding it is to look at it as a soap opera, that the entertainment value comes from the stories between the matches. I guess that would make sense, except that the acting is beyond terrible, the plots are laughable and the writing terrible. I just don't get it.

Now if it were real and these guys actually did beat the crap out of each other it might be acceptable entertainment. When I play the ccg, I just pretend it's a Roman gladiator game and these guys ARE actually beating the crap out of each other...And it works!

The game ends up being a lot of fun. This is another design that uses the deck as a life counter. If you run out of cards, you lose. It's a clever mechanic I have enjoyed in other games as it adds layers of strategy (every card played, makes you a little weaker) and eliminates book keeping all at once. It's also a lot deeper in regards to deckbuilding than I expected, which was a nice surprise.

That's not to say that it was a title that changed the face of gaming. I don't know that I would ever have spent real money on Raw Deal. All of my decks were purchased for next to nothing on the secondary market after the game was discontinued, so as far as I'm concerned the game was well worth the money. Besides, who wouldn't want to play a game that features a card titled "Take That Move, Shine It Up Real Nice, Turn That Sumb*tch Sideways, and Stick It Straight Up Your Roody Poo Candy A%$!"? See, I knew you'd come around...

I really have some great memories of playing this one. I just wish they weren't all soured with the last few expansions of the game...

Publishers take note: Making your established players have to rebuy everything from scratch while invalidating everything they already have is more than likely going to ruin your game.

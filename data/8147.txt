Basic,light interaction game. The Tiki blocking mechanic is interesting (if you guess where your opponent is going, you block his action), however this is a game that's simpler than Tobago or Thurn and Taxis, so for an introductory/family game I'd recommend these two or Thebes or Stone Age who have substantial depth.

Played this one first time in a 2-player session at the Forum boardgame day November 2004.  The board is very nice looking I must say.  The 2-player session with the basic rules was not that special to me.  Willing to give this one another chance with a +2 player session.

Outguessing your opponent game - pleasantly surprised, I wasn't expecting to like it as people were telling me there was no control at all and wasn't the sort of game I'd like. Well I do like it - deduction element is nice and I like the way you have to decide which bit of info to reveal, and try to throw people off, or double bluff and make it look obvious in the hope they'll think "he's clearly trying to make us think he's going there ..."

Had to get this because my partner's name is Maka, she loves to bathe, we both speak Esperanto and Maka bana is Esperanto for "a bathing Maka". A very cute coincidence that made this the perfect present for her. 

We've only played the basic game, but it's quite fnu, if difficult to master and a little luck based. Ironically we found that couples do very well at outguessing one another!

An underrated, almost unknown game. It was unavailable for a loooooong time.
In fact, this game is different than the original. I own the old version (with only 4 beaches) which is already great. I haven't played this new version with 9 beaches yet.

You know, this has gotten fairly poor reviews, but it can be a very fun game to play in the right crowd.  It's not merely a guessing game.  Each player must hint at what he or she intends.  If you want something light and you have a light-hearted crowd, it's a good choice!  It's no more of a guessing game than Dragon Delta or Adel Verpflichtet.

RATING: 5
Maka Bana is an interesting mix of bluffing, simultaneous action selection, set collection, and area control. We had a lot of fun during the start of the game, but the endgame was seriously flawed. When the beaches get crowded the good moves usually become blatantly obvious and you can be sure that one of your fellow players will use their tiki to veto them. This makes it nigh impssible to reach the game end conditions. As a result, the game drags unbearably and becomes a search for the most unlikely (and pretty much useless) move just to inch a bit closer to the end. That pretty much broke the game for us.
I saw afterwards that later printings contain a rules change so that the ninth hut starts the endgame already. This might help a lot, and I'd like to try with that rule although I'm still reluctant to try with 5 players. Without those endgame issues the game would have received a much better rating.

Rating based on one five player game.  I didn't understand the adjacent scoring rule (I wasn't the only one) and I didn't internalize the majority beach rule.  Found the game to be light fun, however, even though I finished last.  Replayability and the nastiness of the game are a concern, and so is the $50 cost.  I'll be content to play my friend's copy for now.

Incroyable que ce 6,6 de note moyenne ! Maka Bana est un des meilleurs jeux français de ces dernières années, avec tous les atouts : d'abord un matériel de jeu à la fois beau et parfaitement adapté à l'action. Ensuite, des règles ultra-simples mais efficaces, claires, et riches de possibilité. Enfin et surtout, c'est un jeu qu'on joue et rejoue régulièrement avec toujours le même plaisir. Evidemment, il ne peut pas avoir auprès des pseudo "pros du jeu" le même prestige qu'un Caylus : thème trop "léger", règle pas assez touffue, manque d'austérité... et pas de connotations médiévales passe-partout ! Eh oui, mais pourtant on peut jouer fun, malin, et subtil sans toutes ces facilités de mode, Maka Bana le prouve.

RATING: 6
Fun game on a island in which you try to get the most victory point.  You get point for every huts you have on the board + a bonus for having multiple huts in a group + a bonus for the player who has the most huts for each of the 4 beach.
On a turn, every player try to build a hut using a combinaison of 3 cards (name of a beach, terrain and symbol) to indiquate a location.  You can also steal a hut of another player by painting his in your color.  Every player must give a hint to the other player by showing one of their 3 card.  All the player will now place their tiki to prevent anybody from building (or repainting) on a specific space.  If the space you have choose to build (or paint) is not protect by a tiki, you can place your hut there.  The game ends when one player as 9 of his 10 huts on the board or when all the spaces on a beach are used.

Found this game (along with Metro) not even knowing what I was getting.  As it turns out, I really love it.  Though organizing a winning build strategy might be the way to win this game, the fun of this game comes in the blocking mechanic.  Trying to read your opponents and guess where they're planning to build during the round is really thrilling for all players.  Being foiled and foiling other players plans is really what this game is all about.  You find yourself glancing around the table watching eyes watching the board and hoping that no one's telepathy is working today...

RATING: 8
This is a simple but surprisingly tension-filled game of out-guessing the other players. Usually games like that involve simultaneous bidding ("blind bidding") or simultaneous action selection; in this game, it's a matter of guessing, based on partial information, where you're opponents are going to build beach huts. I was drawn to this game mainly by the theme and components (huts and tikis!) and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the gameplay.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (December 2010)

It’s been years since I last played Maka Bana. To be honest I don’t remember much about the game. I remember I (somewhat) liked it at the time. I also remember it had easy rules and you have to double guess a lot. If and when I play it again, I will come back and expand on my comment. For now I’m rating it according to my desire to play it again (low).

Good simultaneous action selection game of bluffing and double-guessing in the vein of Adel Verpflichtet. Players have enough indications to make the double-guessing really work. Use the revised end rule: play one last round after a player has built 9/10 huts to avoid a dragging endgame.

Played once without the "legal cheating" rule and with the "paint" rule. This game is quick, psychological and nasty! I really like that! Every turn is full of "agonozing" decision :) What card do I show, do I try to go for 2 consecutives "Payote" or do I try to fill the whole beach, where do I put my Tiki to block the leader... Very enjoyful when played with your family! Easy to learn and full of suspense. A real treat to play.

I understand that MakaBana may not satisfy those who don't like the double guessing games. But that doesn't mean that the game is "boooooring" ;-)
First, this game is beautiful (do you prefer the age of steam board ?)
secondly, this game is original :It is not another simple placement/majority game.  
Thirdly, it's clever. the rule allow you to cheat. But of course, they are rules to cheat.
I really can't understand why MakaBana is juge so severly ...

Lovely looking game.  The components are gorgeous.  The rules are a little confusing though--I think it took us a good ten minutes of arguing and offering opinions before we finally decided that we were clear on them.  Still, it plays well.

[Basic Game] Not a bad bluffing game. Seems like it's either going to get better or worse as people get the hang of the game, so we'll see which way it goes. People getting blocked by a Tiki wasn't uncommon in our 5-player game. Ususally worked out well to choose a second best option and then reveal a card that hints at your first best option. With less players (like 3) it seems like you wouldn't have to worry about other people's Tikis as much. Would that make it better or worse? I don't know.

The game does work, and it has interesting aspects. However, it's one of those ineluctably nasty games: if you don't like games where their very nature force you to be nasty to the other players, then you should avoid this one.

More than I expected, is a good intermediate game, nice idea, nice artwork, good materials: my compliments to Francois.

ok, after many years I played it again and of course i had to lower my rating. Who knows what happened the first time to lead me to a too high 8.7 for this title.
It's fun, ok, but not very deep

Rules easy to explain. Blofing, laughing and evil acting among players make this game appropriate for every company at any time.

This is the type of game that calls for light-hearted intrigue. The first time I played it, I couldn't get a grasp on a strategy to figure out what I needed to do. The second time, it became easier as the "doubleguessing" of what I need to do and what other players could do to foil me was exciting. I'm anxious to play again and again. Definately, one I'd like to own.

With this I have the same problem that I have with Hart an der Grenze - there is not enough reason to not cheat almost the maximum every time. When only a maximum of one player gets accused, it means all the others get away with it. If one player decides never to cheat big thus allowing him to make an accusation, he still gets behind the remaining players. Otherwise, the mechanics are nice.

Fun tactical Super hero game. I had a lot of fun solo, but it is another that requires a lot of table space.

RATING: 8
This looks great. I think the minis would be good to have as well.

Update:

Received from my secret Santa! Played two skirmishes with my boys and it was a lot of fun! Feels more like a superhero game than the card game it's based on, without getting to complicated or fiddly. I think this one will be popular for a while...

Team vs Team game (with tokens/minis) trying to protect or interact with objective(s). Range, Reach, Origin and Vertex aren't explained well in the rules, but we eventually got the gist of what is expected (we think).  I enjoy playing the villains.  Have only played with Baron Blade and Citizens (but not Citizen Dawn).

1st play: Surprisingly a decent Sentinels game. Gone are the unavoidable damages and villains and heroes seem balanced. The board works and the powers give heroes unique flavor. Still not amazing but I enjoyed it. 

2nd play: Bad scenario for the villain, my power straight up countered his mission goals but it was still entertaining. Not a go-to game but I won't mind playing again if it's picked.

Not sure on this one yet.  We tried a skirmish but it wasn't particularly engaging.  I'm hoping the scenarios will have more draw.  We were gifted the minis though, so I think the enjoyment of this game will go way up ;)

Superheroes are the hardest sell with me.  I'd even rather be a zombie pyramid builder in Renaissance Italy. I'm generally not fond of skirmish games either.  This ultra-simple slugfest only cemented those prejudices.  It didn't help that there were five of us and so eight turns (the Big Bad takes a turn between each good guy's turn) before the next of mine.  That was far too much downtime.   

Had the minis been painted I might have warmed to Sentinel Tactics more.  Had the board not been a featureless cityscape then ditto.  Production quality is good.

This game is just downright fun. I'm not a fan of wargames, and I usually do not like direct conflict in games.  This game, along with  Star wars  epic duels, are certainly the exception. The variability of characters, the different place style while using different characters, the colorful components, and the numerous ways to play the game make it exciting every time.   I am really surprised the game is not more popular. It seems to be off the radar, which makes me sad. Likely, expenses are coming. That said, there is plenty in the base game to keep one entertained. I have the first expansion, which is also very fun to play.

Deeply thematic, Sentinel Tactics makes playing superhoeroes fun at last: everything feels cartoonish here, which was missing from the other games in the genre. Even the whole hackneyed "superheroes saving the day" subject is handled with some levity in Tactics, an uncommon but welcome twist in an usually boring genre that lately tends to take itself way too seriously.

My only complaint with the game is, downtimes are far too long and leave you absolutely nothing to do (at least in the scenario-based games) until you're up again. Activating once in a dozen minutes or so might disconnect you from immersing into the theme.

On a side note, characters feel a little too ordinary: had they really gone crazy with tongue in cheek, unseriously-looking and playing superheroes not only would they have done my day but they would also have created the ultimate superhoeroes game.
But that is nitpicking.

RATING: 2.25
A good streamlined, strategic weapon selection mechanic is hindered by the game being tactically too simple. The characters are flavourful and have interesting abilities. You may find a dominant strategy for a certain scenario and just play that for n turns with obvious best moves. The winner is determined by dice rolls (or by character selection). The missions are thematically interesting.

RATING: N/A
Rich theme, good theme-mechanics integration, and nearly all of the randomness is in "does what you try to do succeed?" rather than "what can you try to do?" The  mechanics, while simple, have good hooks for a wide variety of superpowers. There's scenario mode and team play; I find the former awesome in concept, though I'll probably get more milage out of the latter - I don't have many team games. (And: getting KOed in this one doesn't put you out of the game, which is a nice plus.)

The couple times I've played, I've run into what seem like mismatches where one hero is mostly helpless against another... but it's all been with inexperienced players (and I include myself in that number), so I really can't tell if this is a game like core Sentinels where "X is great/terrible vs. Y" is just how it is, or if it's a game like BattleCON where you can overcome a lopsided matchup with skillful play. The more it swings towards the latter, the more I'll like the game.

My wife prefers Sentinel Tactics to Sentinels of the Multiverse, because she says Tactics makes her feel more like she is playing as a hero. With only 7 cards to keep track of, a lot of the game is on the board, not in your hand. It's simpler, with a lot of the fiddliness of Sentinels of the Multiverse removed. I really, really like it, I've even made 3d terrain for all the tiles. Storage is tricky though, so far I'm rocking a Tupperware container, but the expansions to be released next year will make my current method obsolete.

Sentinel Tactics takes what was great about Sentinels of the Multiverse and expands upon it.  Sentinel Tactics takes place after the conclusion of Sentinels of the Multiverse in terms of story as the heroes have become independent of their original government contract in order to best protect the world from the forces of evil.  While the original SotM was a card game, ST is a tactical miniatures hex-based game.  

Players assume the roles of either the heroes or villains fighting one another using dice to determine whether attacks are successful or not.  There are scenario books which players can use to complete story arcs or players can use the characters to fight in free-for-all, king of the hill, or other free-form objectives.  

While I personally enjoy the original SotM a bit more, Sentinel Tactics plays fast and is easy to learn.  There are miniatures you can purchase separately, but they aren't necessary, just a nice addition.  With one expansion already out, more are in development meaning that more adventures in the world of Sentinels is coming.

I've played Sentinels of the Multiverse once and now have played Sentinels Tactics once.  The phase that came to be about both is 'needlessly complicated'.
I liked this board game a little better than the card game. I think if I played it more I would get to know the characters and their strengths / weaknesses and would have more fun.

I'm a huge fan of the card game, but this fell really flat for me.  Played through the first scenario book, and really didn't get engaged at all.  Not really any interesting decisions to make, fittley LOS rules, too swingy on dice rolls.  It's Heroscape without the cool terrain.   Too bad.

RATING: 9.5
A great tactical superhero game. This is exactly what I've been waiting for in superhero games - real combat with actual spatial tactics combined with great superpowers and the potential for non-combat related goals/victory conditions. More than any other game I've seen, this one gives you the total superhero experience. I love the way you have to choose which powers you're using at any time and the versatility of the combat system is amazing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.7
Very quick, highly thematic skirmish game. Love how much story is incorporated. It just feels great. Each fight tells a little story, scenario or not, with little action beats just like in a move. For instance, A giant robot powers up for a massive rocket stomp against a badass ninja lady who dodges the cumbersome attack easily but is struck in the head by a dislodged brick, and is incapacitated. What happens when One character uses 2 atk +1 tokens, to roll like six dice, auto misses on all but two, and then defending character rolls three incredibly low dice and takes those two hits despite using a dodge token to raise the values. That's what this game is. Is it balanced, heck no. Is it huge and sprawling? Nope. But it is fun, and anyone who likes superheros will be dragged to the table, and anyone who likes tactics games will likely walk away satisfied. Additionally, if you're like me, the game is very easy to modify and customize with home brewed scenarios and heroes and even locations. Bonus. I will do my best to make this a staple in my groups.

Brought the game to family Christmas and I've got to bump up the score. played 5 times, including a 3 game session. My older Brother and younger cousins loved it, and I see now just how much replayabilty there is with the expansion (and my somewhat underwhelming but interesting created heroes). Each character is like learning a slightly different game in the best way possible. The game swings a bit toward whoever goes first though.

Based only on the first scenario (so far), it's a medium-to-lightweight tactical game that captures the super-powered theme remarkably well.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (May 2015)

Fun game to play from time to time. I really like Sentinels of the Multiverse so I like the universe of Sentinel Tactics. They share not only the theme, but also many mechanics have a similar feel. It is neat to play as the villain (I always play the baddie) and when I played it, the game was very close for both teams, tense and fun.

I’m not sure if I like how movement is handled, it seems very random and was the reason a player lost last time. I need to play more times to really see if this bothers me or not. Sentinel Tactics is a Light-Medium weight game.

I’m not sure if each scenario is meant to play independently or as a campaign of sorts. I prefer to play it as a two player game, but I will also play from 2 to 4 players. Not sure how the game can handle an 8 player game, but I’m afraid to ask. I have to read the rules to solve these questions.

Bottom line, I like Sentinel Tactics, not as much as Sentinels of the Multiverse but I can see myself playing this again in the future. Perhaps I will buy it but the main problem I have right now is a shortage of play time. I’m already committed playing a Myth and Imperial Assault campaigns so I’m not sure if I can squeeze another tactics game to the mix. 

I bought an expansion for this game by mistake, I thought it was a Sentinels expansion :/.

[u]Comments:[/u]
I first played Sentinel Tactics at GenCon 2013 and I was immediately blown away by the game play. For GenCon 2014 I got to play a finished copy and I have to say it makes the game even more awesome. Its almost more thematic than the card game it is based on. I truly felt like a superhero running around the board bashing in other super powered individuals. The management of the power cards is brilliant and really makes players think ahead to set up awesome combos. The game play is simple and easy to pick up and just goes to show you why Greater Than Games shows why they have corned the market in super hero games. World building has become their specialty and Sentinel Tactics just adds much more awesomeness to the whole enchilada. I'm looking forward to being able to support another product from a great company in my favorite gaming universe currently running.

Big props to GtG for delivering a kickstarter game four months early, and a kickstarter miniatures game at that! Bravo GtG, bravo. It's your move rest of world.

Your first couple of turns your first game you will have no idea what you are doing, and the game is pretty text heavy right off the get go. Afterwards the game flows much more smoothly. I am not sure how balanced the characters are but they feel pretty different from each other. Damage from combat seems especially luck based in this game but I find how they did range really thematic: it makes sense that it would be harder to hit a target from farther away, and incentivizes not just staying in one location firing long range attacks from afar. Elevation in terms of movement and range is also pretty intuitive although I keep getting confused by the line of sight rules. I am unsure about how replayable each scenario is, as since you have all your options available to you each round, you could probably adopt a similar strategy each game. Rulebook is ambiguous about multiple things (e.g. Ra's fire tornado attack).

As a massive fan of Sentinels of the Multiverse I was excited to try a combat game based in the same universe and the result is pretty successful. Having the rulebook and scenarios look like comicbooks is fun and the rules system is pretty good (the combat is great), however the board can be a little confusing to read and it's a real shame that the miniatures have to be purchased separately.

Superheroes are hard to do in skirmish games, since you have to tackle the problem of players spamming powers over and over. There's a danger of there being precious little tactics in such a game. The card power system seems to fix this in Sentinels: Tactics, but the real problem is that positional play has so little effect on fighting. Maybe wargame-style manoeuvring on a board just simply doesn't work for superhero games. The card-driven narratives of the progenitor Sentinels of the Universe are superior to this by far. This is not horrible, but it's something of a dud.

This is still fundingon Kickstarter as of 04/08/2014. This is not due to deliver until December 2014. Damn, that's the peak of the holiday season in this country. Hopefully I'll receive it by my birthday in 2015. My pledge is at the $100 level and I'm easily going to receive $150+ worth of goods. I'm so excited! (Patrick)

RATING: 5.75
This was pretty disappointing for me. The theme is nice and it comes with a fair few heroes, villains, and scenarios, but... one problem is it's very much a dice chucker style of game, and it's a roll and move style as well. So it's quite random. Doesn't really work as a multi-player free for all, so you have to play it as a team based co-op

Hands down my favourite superhero game. No other superhero game I've played captures that comic feel quite like this one. Simply amazing.

We've had some struggles getting the rules right (I think they're very lacking). And I don't like the dots representing height, because they're really hard to see when the hex is occupied. But it is fun (if fiddly), and my kids love the Sentinels universe.

It took a friend of mine a long time to talk me into playing this with him given how disappointing Sentinels of the Multiverse is... but Sentinel Tactics is a surprisingly decent game considering its lineage.
The key is that ST actually offers its players agency. I know, it is a sad day when a game deserves praise just for the innovation of allowing players to make meaningful decisions, but there you go.

half a play and it seems to play a lot like Heroscape with a deck of powers to go with each character..  the random movement per turn is strange and I don't think it adds to the game. 

I like Heroscape better because of the cool terrain and the terrain seems to matter more than in Sentinel Tactics.

The theme integration is great.  However, choices are low, randomness is high, and strategy is paper thin.  I think the engine is fine, and the characters are mostly fine (except for some balancing), but the scenarios (and especially skirmish games) do a poor job at capitalizing on those elements and the game falls flat.  Too often, your plays are obvious given the situation, RPS and luck dominate outcomes, and spatial maneuvering is just not relevant.

I do like this game. I think the dice system is unique and I love the way that different powers can be switched out. I appreciate their attempts to capture the verticality of a city, but the movement and line of sight rules can be very finicky. How much mileage one gets out of the theme depends on how much one loves the sentinels theme. I like superheroes, but these are not Marvel/DC and that does make a bit of a difference.

Christmas 2014 gift from Julia for Zack. (Includes additional miniatures for the Flame of Freedom base game).  I have trouble getting this to the table.  It really needs a committed group of gamers to get my money's worth I think.  I have not bailed on it yet though.  The minis look great and it really is a fun game to play when you have the right group to play it with.

Good, not great.  If solely trying to spend time in the Sentinels universe, I would much prefer to play the card game.  Some quirky rules to learn and understand, but I'm sure it would be much clearer upon a few more play throughs.  If played in some campaign style would probably be a pretty cool thing to do with a relatively set group of people.  If someone wanted to play it, I would.

Lots of missing clarity in the rules, still a good game.

Much better to play a skirmish than in any of the scenarios that come with the game. 

The ratings a bit over-inflated from all the people who pre-ordered it, over time I expect it to flatten out to a good mid-6 score on BGG.

RATING: 8
Backed the Kickstarter.  Tentative rating, based on a solitaire solo play to get comfortable with the rules and a second play with 2 players total (playing scenario 1 of the Baron Blade arc)

Update: Rating stands after one play with 3 and another with 4.  Scenario 1 of both the Omnitron arc and the Baron Blade arc again, respectively. It feels much harder to play the villains, based on what I've seen thus far.

I just don't see it hitting the table as often at the original Sentinels game.

If I get another chance to play this, I might bump it up. It's rated down this low because I thought the elevation/line of sight rules could be a little fiddly and hard to visualize. But it was my first time playing.

This game is simply outstanding.  Take Sentinels of the Multiverse and reduce the book keeping, but keep the intense game flavour and the FEELING that you are being a super hero, and you get the idea of what Sentinel Tactics is like.  I want to play this all the time, but I've gotta eat and sleep sometime...

RATING: 4
On sale for $15? Not a good sign for the game, but seems like it's worth trying at that price.

Update: It just seems okay. The minis are pretty bad, so I'm glad they were also on sale for just $10 because they're not worth more than that. Each mini has its own base that is separate, so you have to find the right base and then wedge the feet into it every time. The minis  are also an off-putting bright white for some reason.
As for the game itself, it's just okay. Feels kind of like a dumbed down Descent because of the one vs all element and the move and fight gameplay. The line of sight and elevation rules are pretty bad, but one might get used to it after a few games.
The battle system is actually kind of neat, but there aren't a ton of ways to mitigate the dice rolls other than adding in extra dice, so the luck of the dice is pretty big. Descent at least has different distributions for the different dice, and the lightning bolt that lets you activate special abilities.
Overall not terrible, but just not that good. This game, followed up by the awful Sentinel Story Wars game makes the future of any future SotM products look pretty grim.

Sold.

Fall, 2014. Started tracking games late. Add about 3 to the number of plays.I want to play a few more times, but the game is moving toward the chopping block for me. I love the concept, but it's falling flat somehow. I'm afraid the game just doesn't resonate for me, but we'll see.

Rating is based off of initial play, 5 player game.

***WOW***  Grain of salt, I love super heroes, and I'm a fan of Sentinels of the Multiverse.  That having been said, this game is REALLY GOOD.

There are a lot of "vs rolling" dice mechanics that are around now days, but I really feel like Sentinel Tactics hits the nail on the head in terms of how distance, defense, actions, and firepower are all handled together.

Player powers are also brilliant, with the ability to "slot in" two powers per hero, but being able to rotate these as the game progresses.

The art and great writing remains, and the comic book style rule/scenario books are awesome.

I only have one game under my belt, but this is an instant must-own for me post-Gen Con.  Huge replayability potential just from varying heroes in scenarios, coupled with scenarios and player created designs.

A miniature skirmish game that
- really feels like superheroes because of the very assymetric powers (actually represented by game mechanisms)
- feels like superheros battling it out in something like the training room of the X-Men, and because of the very different powers it always delivers epic fights, but is also light and fast enough
- has a clever dice system that rarely feels to be about luck because of range, auto-miss and defense die evens it out a lot, and all games i played feel balanced in the end
- has really interesting and thematic scenarios and campaigns
- you can buy without the miniatures which I don't really care about, so I get a great game for way less money
- and just like Sentinels Of The Multiverse, instead of getting some IP and building a game around it thus feeling forced, here you naturally get to know the characters from the game itself, by way of illustrations and game mechanisms

RATING: 8
Great game. Love playing it. I'm a big heroclix fan, so it has similar strategic gameplay feel, and yet simpler on the rules, with some fun twists. Definitely prefer the scenario play rather than the skirmish. Skirmish is fun, but is better with more players. I think 4+ would be ideal for the skirmish mode.

Sentinels expands and replaces the base card game with a team oriented, tactical miniatures full-on geek smorgasborg. Tons-o-dice, mass variety of superheroes and super powers, sentinel superhero comic book scenarios, reversible modular hex boards, sets of miniatures--dying to be painted (sold separate I think), and chits for everything.  Too much of a good thing for me but I can see this becoming a big hit. I should get this game just for the elegant combat system.

Sentinels of the Multiverse was my favorite game ever but I think Sentinels Tactics might just beat it out. If you want a lighter easier to teach/learn game go with Multiverse but if you want a even more fun heavier game go with Tactics. Or you could just get both ;)

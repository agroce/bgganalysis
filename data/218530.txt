My new favorite hidden role game. I like it because there is still a game present once you figure out who's on your team. It plays quickly, and it's easy to teach.

RATING: 6.5
Each time I've played the game with new players, they pretty quickly notice that the event deck is pretty thick and that if that's the end-game marker, than that's a longer commitment than they'd really like for a social deduction game. I'd probably suggest removing about 8 cards from the event deck with the rules as written.

The better suggestion would be that the game provide mechanisms to get through the event deck faster. Once we figure out our teams, we can look at the events and then advise our teammates, but it takes a while to get to that point, and that still takes two turns to accomplish and only works if you're sitting next to one another. The game probably would have been better if they a rule like, "Look at two cards. Choose a player and indicate any two cards, where only one is a card that you just looked at. They must choose and play one of the cards you have indicated." Alternately, the could have colored the event cards light are dark, where light cards are *probably* good and dark cards are *probably* bad, but not necessarily. That would allow people to play events without having to burn a turn looking.

Many of the reviews recommend 7 players. I found, at that player count, that people were losing track of the turn order and getting easily distracted with the amount of time it took for the turn to get around the table. Because you have to wait for everyone to carefully pull, read, and restore event cards, shuffle cards together, tally votes, reshuffle the vote card deck (which doesn't have enough cards), it can take a while for the rotation to get back to you with 7 players. We all enjoyed ourselves, but I definitely wouldn't say that that's the best player count. Get two slow players in the mix and you're going to be a real sad puppy. I feel like the people voting for 7 player games are lying to themselves because they like the graphic design or because they backed it on Kickstarter or something. It's playable at 7, but it's not best.

It's a pretty decent game. I just think that it could have used a little bit more fine tuning.

Haven't had a chance to get the game to a table yet, but its presentation is freakin' gorgeous. 

The art on the cards has a cool style, it has wooden meeple-ey bits, a game board that's like a re-purposed mouse pad, and the box... oh man, the box.

The game box is shaped like a book, and it snaps shut with a magnet. There's no text or anything on the back, so it actually looks like a hardcover book.

I'll update this review once I get a few friends together to try the game out.

Severely disappointed. There is very little a team can do to come back, other than randomly draw cards and hope for lucky draws. Captains can do far too much and other ship mates can be kicked off at the whim of the captain. Nice that it is short, but not so short that I ever feel the need to play again.

Nice components. i am hoping someone comes up with better house rules/variants to make this actually playable or fun.

Really nice production, typical for a good Kickstarter. I didn't back it myself after some hesitation and having played it three times now, I'm glad I passed up on this one. It's a hidden role type of game where one (secret) team tries to get more treasure chests than the other. The game is the most interesting when there's an uneven number of players because then a third team of one person takes part that will win when there's a tie in the end.

Roles of everyone become known quite fast (except the third one), because the penalty for acting against your role is often too steep. And without the secrets there is not much game left. Many actions are played through a voting system using symbols on the cards, but which cards you have is random and in the voting always a random card is added. Even when you're the only one to vote an action can still be cancelled.

Then there's event cards that do all kinds of random stuff. Ugh. The ideas in the game are fine but it's such a messy design.

This game has a lot going for it. Odd or even number of players are very different games, but both great ways to play. I prefer an even game. For odd games you should always use the dutch card. Tried a couple times with 2v1 or 3v2, and it didn't turn out well. Quick game to play with larger groups and easy to teach (harder to learn from the rulebook). I prefer to play a little bit longer game than suggested. I put 6 special event cards in the deck instead of 3. Small change, but it helps.

I recommend this for large player groups of people. It works best with 5-9 players in my opinion.  Less than 5 and the experience suffers a bit I think.

For those that say "You should just admit to what team you are on." I will tell you what happened last game and how it was epic. I started as the first mate on the Flying Dutchman. Our captain told the crew, my friend and I, that he was attacking the Spanish galleon. We helped him and he placed the treasure on the British side, now I was British but our cabin boy was displeased with this, instead of telling the captain "hey let's ditch this cabin boy" I began the subterfuge. On my next turn I asked the cabin boy if he'd join me in a mutiny he was glad to hear it and we stranded my British captain, my ally on the island, making him governor of tortuga. 
Now I had the absolute loyalty of one of the French players convinced I was his partner, the other French player was called Dutch, and the real Dutch player was helping my British friend so everyone thought I was French. We filled the ship with treasure but oh no the British controlled the island, sarcasm, so I told my cabin boy listen we need that island treasure I'm going to maroon you so you can get over to that other treasure. Then as soon as he's gone I start moving treasure over to the British side, and my friend goes "he's a traitor" it's too late for the Dutch player to rebalance things on the other ship because my true ally mutinies the Dutch captain and now the British control both ships and to make things even better, one of the frenchies on the island draws scurvy by accident and all three of the non English players lose their next turn because of the scurvy on the island. British win 6-2. Epic victory

This game is great! My younger sons (8&6) play it with us with help and have been dressing up as pirates around the house every day since the game arrived in the mail.

The gameplay is straightforward, but there is enough back and forth that my wife and I were on a team (winning with almost each treasure) and then lost to our sons by the end. 

Fun, quick, and the hidden loyalty aspect is a great component.

This was a fun game with multiple things happening as your are trying to get the most treasures for you team. The cards can be harsh but discovering what they are is one of the actions that can be done. It's a small box game with great production but the map is a little small when playing with large counts of people. Posistioning is still easy to see is this case so it still works.

Card Game

Each player receives a Loyalty card secretly aligning them with the British, French, or Dutch. Most players serve the British or French, while a single player owes allegiance to the Dutch. Throughout the game, players can move gold pieces on the two pirate ships and on Tortuga to either the French hold or British hold at each location. The game ends when the Spanish Armada card is revealed. If all the British holds together have more gold than the French holds, the British win. If the opposite is true, the French win. If it’s a tie, the single Dutch player wins.

[October 2017 - 7.1]
Good social deduction game of a lighter/nicer flair than the Resistance or Secret Hitler. There's less accusations and political intrigue than those games. Tortuga 1667 is more about maneuvering and timing.

With its hidden-role mechanic, it more resembles Saboteur or even A Study in Emerald, in that it usually doesn't take long to figure out who's on what side. You can bluff, but not for very long as the game tends to move along faster than you think. There's really not much reward for bluffing, either, beyond maybe getting a card out of it. 

The problem with these "nobody knows who anyone is" games is that you don't know who to lie to. Eg. If you act like you're British when you're really French, your true French teammates will just be the ones trying to hurt you.  What do you gain?

That being said, it's a fun game that plays well at higher counts and best with an odd number of people so that the Dutch are in play (that one player wants the game to the end in a tie to win on their own).

Great theme and production quality to the game.

The year is 1667 and you are a pirate sailing the waters of the Caribbean. A Spanish Galleon floats nearby, and you’ve talked your crewmates into working together to steal all of its treasure. What you haven’t told your fellow pirates is that you have no intentions on sharing the treasure once you have it. Your crewmates have told you that they share your loyalty and that they’ll help you maroon the greedy pirates on your ship to the rocky island of Tortuga. But you’ve seen your friends’ loaded pistols and heard their whisperings of a mutiny. You know that nobody can be trusted.

Great with larger groups, but — and I’m sure this is true with many hidden identity games — playing with people who are bad at or unwilling to lie means everyone knows which side everyone is playing for very quickly. Even still, figuring out how to manoeuvre with that knowledge is challenging and fun.

Game production itself is impressive and everyone appreciates the packaging and great art. Only thing: the play mat is small, so, with 6-7 people around a table, the play area seems far for everyone. With 9, I can imagine it gets worse. This almost begs for a giant version.

My first kickstarter. I'll be honest, 50% of reason for backing this game is because of the box. It's made like an old book and looks great on my shelf.

The components of this game are of great quality. I like the theme and art of Tortuga. However, the one time I played this game with my family it fell flat. At first they didn't get the concept at all. Even after a complete playthrough there was very little excitement about this game. 

So right now Tortuga is an expensive decoration piece. Not my best purchase, as a matter of fact it might be the worst, but I'm willing to play this a few more times before getting rid of the game. That said, I have no idea when I'll pull this out again.

Kickstarter pre-order. [No stretch goals were available with the game.] Group social gaming with higher player counts is trending, and these are always good in our gaming group's variable player numbers, so was intrigued by the "up to 9" player count and the pirate theme that seems intuitive and less abstract than many social, groupthink, and pirate-themed games. Look forward to trying this with higher player numbers, and am curious if "a milder version of Lifeboats" will prove accurate.

Game looks great on the table, and they did well integrating the pirate theme throughout the graphic design and mechanics. Main issue is that there are too many mechanics that force randomness, limiting player's abilities to ascertain other player's nationalities, thus further limiting meaningful decisions. I really didn't like that the rules state that you add a random card from the draw deck to the cards players use to vote. You can't deduce other player's intentions with a wild card element thrown in like that. It just becomes a meaningless tug of war over placement of treasure chests. Three out of the five people I played with felt the same way. The other two players were ambivalent.

Backed on Kickstarter!

I’ve only played twice—and both times with few players—and I very much want to play again with more people. I really like the taste of it I’ve gotten, but mostly because I imagine it’s _really_ great with more people. If that’s not true, I might lower my rating.

I found it took a relatively long time to explain the game to friends, but worth it to me—I hope to them, too.

Social deduction game where some players are French or English.  I an odd numbered player game, one player can be Dutch.  Every player takes on a roll and is trying to move treasure to their side of the ship or on the island of Tortuga.  There  are lot of other actions where you can look at cards or play them or ask other to play them.  There is a big memory element.  

It is an interesting game but did not find it better than the Resistance.  This game might rise in my estimations.

This is a neat, neat little game that doesn't take much to learn but offers a lot of different routes once you're in. We've only playex 2-player (because that's all we are) and it was a tight little battle to the finish that went back and forth until she just pounced. I can imagine easily how much fun this will be with four or more people. An excellent game, good fun.

I remember pretending to be a Brit at the start once, and (probably 'cause they were new to the game) everyone believed me. When I later on moved the deciding point to the French cargo, everyone (including myself) laughed in realisation. That was, until I found out that I myself had been played by the Dutchman...

This game plays with your mind.

I highly recommend this game for 3+ players. Even so, I've played the game a lot with only one person (two players), and it works okay. I'd even say it's fun, but the really enjoyable part is playing with a bunch of people, and trying to deceive each other.

A fantastic game. I've played it now at several different player counts and it has proved to be a fun experience every time (still haven't tried fewer than 5 though). Component quality is top notch, mechanics and balance are solid, theme is strong, and the social experience really shines through. A good game for experienced gamers and new gamers alike (my parents liked it a lot). I wholeheartedly recommend this little gem from a small publisher. They knocked it out of the park on this one.

You are a pirate on the waters of the Caribbean in 1667, working with your crewmates to steal all of the treasure from a nearby Spanish Galleon before an opposing crew, but with true loyalties hidden it could be you who ends up marooned on the rocky island of Tortuga. 

A card-driven party game of hidden roles.

I'm always looking for games that can accomodate large groups of players well.   This game accomplishes that.  It takes a LONG time to read through the rules.  But it's a fast game as you're only allowed one action on your turn.  Hence the turns go fast and you're not bored waiting for your fellow players to get through their turn.

RATING: 9
Easy game to pick up and play. I like that it doesn't take much space to play and fits in the "Book". The gameplay is solid and can be altered for 2 to 9 players which is great. I enjoy the different aspects of how to get and try to keep treasures along with the variety that comes into play when the Dutch get added for 3rd player onward.

I decided to back Tortuga as a change from the classic social deduction games of Avalon and Ultimate Night Werewolf. I'm particularly interested in the spatial dimension, where you physically move to a ship/quest rather than rely on being voted for a quest.

Update: Sold because I felt that it was too easy to deduce who plays in which team, reducing the game to playing cards against each other.

This game is fantastic. I have played it just a few times, but it has been a huge hit. During Christmas my whole extended family would just talk about when to play it next (even people who don't like games). It's even a fun game to lose. 

I have only played it with 6 players, but imagine it would be fun with more. I don't think it would be nearly as fun with fewer than 5 players.  If you have an odd number of players there will be deception and confusion due to the Dutch loyalty (neutral faction, somewhat like a renegade in BANG).  Once everyone knows how to play it can go quickly.

The components and the themeing are great. My only complaint was that the mat the game comes on was not perfectly cut so the decorative border looks a little inconsistent. However, it doesn't affect game play and I doubt anyone but me noticed in the games we played. I love the book-box. 

The game is very strategic and social. It depend on who you play it with. If you play it with young family members or non-analytic players it's going to be chaotic and very casual. However, there is a lot of opportunity for strategy and in my family it was pretty deliberate and strategic. 

I'm struggling to come up with suggestions improvements. Some of my initial concerns (balance issues) turn out to be purposeful mechanisms to move the game forward and promote strategy. Once you understand how to play the rounds go quickly and doesn't generally drag.  Most moves require actions require participation by others, people are always engaged and participating even with larger groups. 

The instructions are straight forward and written for understanding and clarity. There are suggestions for variants and basic information about strategy. One of the best parts about the game is the historical context. The instructions give a bio of each playable character and really give the game life. 

This game is a great mix of theme, strategy, and social interaction. It really does well on all fronts in my book and works great for big groups.  It's obvious the designers play-tested this game and created it with love. My only caution is it might not be as fun with smaller groups (though I have not tried).

RATING: 5
Feels like it is missing something.  Played with full 9 and really just wanted it to end.  There needs to be a mechanism for players to secretly communicate their allegiances to the others or for others to be able to peek.  Maybe allowing cards to be passed without revealing them somehow?? Really not possible given the current deck.  

As is now I would not play with an even number of people.  The Dutch team is the only reason you wouldn't just announce your team.  I also was not crazy about the end game.  The deck seemed to take forever to get through,  Eventually we were just randomly picking cards to execute to get the game completed and move on to something else.  These were 9 very experienced gamers playing.  A number of rounds might be nice, or have a certain number of cards wiped at round end to move things along.

RATING: 5
(+) Simple ruleset allows players to become involved in the action right at the onset.  
(+) Player interaction is frequent though the tone is lighthearted. Interesting alliance dynamics can form during the game which fuel dialogue outside the game state. This is a social game.  
(+) Accommodates a large player count very well.  

(-) Hiding your alliance is hit or miss. Playing at even player count makes it easy to suss out who is who, which lessens the suspense. The gameplay itself is a bit underwhelming and repetitive.  
(-) Does not play too well at low and/or even-numbered player counts (by virtue of the above point, lacking a player whose alliegiance is to the Dutch, or else lacking widespread shared incenctives) 
(-) A player who mis-manages their hand can end up locking themselves out of the game (or become locked out by an unfortunate albatross appearance)

Very random and chaotic.  Similar to the Resistance but with even more randomness.  There's not much one can do even if they do discover who's on their side.  Fun to play as a quick filler but nothing more than that.

Great hidden role game with a light theme. This is not Secret Hitler. This is a light romp where you are either French, English, or Dutch and try to steal the treasures for your side. Near perfect. Best with 7 or 9, then 8, then 6. Would not play with less than 6.

Like Salem, this is not a game to be played with few friends, but to be enjoyed by the maximum the game allows. That said, and having in mind that I only played with two more players, you can see how well its innovative mechanisms work and, moreover, how fun it surely gets with more people. Will update once I get to try it with five or six of my friends.

Very nice design with some fun play elements.  However in the 6 player game I played, it became obvious that one should admit to which team you on with no incentive to lie.  Rating could go up if playing with the Dutch team (a player onto himself) upends this issue.  Update:  even with the Dutch player, the team who is most up front about what team they were on seemed to have the advantage (they won in any case).  This was with 5 players.  Note it still had some elements of chaotic fun.  Now I'll need to try with seven to get a final verdict.

Tortuga 1667 is a social deduction game. Players are randomly split between the French and British (and one person is Dutch with an odd number of players). Teams are secret. The goal is to end the game with your nation having the most gold (of the 8 gold chests on the board). The Dutch player wins if there is a tie.

Players have a hand of three cards. Each card has 3 sections which reflect the possible uses for the card. The top of the card either shows a cannon, torch or bucket, which are used for attacking on the ship. The middle of the card shows either a British or French flag, which are used for brawling on the island. And the bottom of the card shows either a skull or (something else, I forget what) which is used on ships when a mutiny is called. You'll likely have cards that you want to use for more than one purpose or cards that don't do anything you want. When there's an attack, brawl or mutiny all the players in that area contribute a card, then a random card from the deck is added, so there's never any certainty if someone betrayed you or if it was a random card from the deck.

In the game there's five different places you can be. You can be in either of the two ships. Either of two rowboats between the ships and the island of Tortuga. Or you can be on Tortuga itself. The order of people in all these locations is important.

On the ships, the first position is the captain (who can attack call for an attack on the Spanish Galleon for gold). The second position is the first mate (who can call for a mutiny). And whoever is in the last spot (whether that's the fifth person or the second is the cabin boy (who can move treasure between the French and British holds on the ship).

On the island, the first position is the governor who can call for a brawl (which redistributes the two treasures on the island to either Britain or France).

There's also a card row with hidden events which a lot of game revolves around. Events can be good or bad, sometimes triggering against the player who drew them and sometimes being cards you give to another player. They do a lot to move people around and changing positions/roles.

As actions you can either do your special role power, look at two hidden event cards, reveal (trigger) and event card, or force someone to choose between two event cards to reveal (trigger). When you've gone through the entire deck, the last card is the Spanish Armada. When that's put into play, the five hidden events are shuffled so that you don't know which is the armada. When the armada is revealed, the game ends and whichever team has the most gold wins.

I generally like social deduction games and this one was fun. Our play went very well for the French who basically dominated the entire game, winning with control of both ships and the island. I think that might have been a bit of a fluke. This seems like a game that could play out differently every time. I'd be interested in trying it again and seeing how it goes when it's not quite so one sided.

This one is a blast. You can really do all the mind games in order to manipulate the other players. 
I loved playing this, there is plenty of choice to do on your turn, it never gets boring since you're usually interested in watching the other's turns to see who could be with you and who's not.
The scoring is so well balaced that you can afford to give a treasure once in a while to the "other team", that is just brilliant and keeps the outcome insecure.
PHANTASTIC GAME!!!

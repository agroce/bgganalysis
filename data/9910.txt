I sense this would be much more fun with the miniatures, but I actually did enjoy this with the cards only. It's not great, but it certainly isn't bad either. It's one of those "in-the-middle" games for me that strike me as less of a eurogame and more of a miniature combat game.

I have only had the pleasure of playing myself in this game, and so it was a disappointment.  I think this is a mid-to-light game and would be a lot of fun with a group of gamers looking for a fun and fast moving game... but I just don't know yet.  So I will let this languish with just a 7 for the moment.

I used to play and love Blue Max back in the day (yes I'm that old) and that's what initially attracted me to this game. Wings of War is different than the old Blue Max, and it's better! It's a great game if this sort of stuff blows your hair back. I prefer the WWI versions to the others, but that's just my personal preference. Recommended!

A good idea but I don't think it flows as well as I would like. More setup- and preparation-time than actually playing it out. Then I like Robo Rally more cause of the board-interaction. Here you don't have any kind of interaction apart from shooting each other.

I'm kind of torn on this one.  There's not much new in the box, there are some new planes and some new maneuver decks, but really nothing else.  It doesn't add anything to the game play (in fact it even uses the exact same rule book).

The game is still a lot of fun, but this add-on/expansion pack doesn't add much for the $$s.  If you own the other set, I'd wait for the boosters that are coming.

Good light game.  A lot of fun to play after playing a heavier game, or with a large group.  If luck is a problem, either play multiple planes, or take the explosion card out of the deck.  I enjoy the planes in Famous Aces slightly more than the planes in this set (but both combine beautifully, if you're looking to get 8 players playing).

- Useless expansion. The two-seat planes are invincible. And you only have a movement deck for all the two-seaters. Meaning: you can only use one per game (did you notice the title of this game? Brilliant...)

Very fun and quick-playing game of slow planes in aerial combat. Very evocative of the theme. Great graphics and it all really worked for me. I think the best part was that the game was not reliant on many random factors, and the strategy of combat was up to you.

More interesting than FA because of mission-based scenarios (taking photos, bombing, etc). Planes are less powerful than FA ones and not really balanced for dogfights
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A stand-alone expansion that doesn't offer many new things, just more variety, with the exception of a deck of two-seaters and less deadly ammo. Since one set contains too little to make for inspiring repeat gaming for two players (it too quickly becomes random cruising in the hope of finding yourself in an opening position in which spatial logic can make a difference), I firmly believe that [i]Famous Aces[/i] and [i]Watch Your Back[/i] should have been released as a single game from the word go.

It doesn't mean that I don't think that this is a great addition to a superb system. It does mean that for a separate release this covers too little new ground that isn't already covered in the initial release. Variety alone doesn't create top marks in my book. So I've marked it down from my [i]Famous Aces[/i] rating as I could have done without the extra box and avoidable expenses, and because it convinced me I have bought two half-games instead.

If this had come out as a blister, or as the original set, I would have rated this as an 8.5, as I feel that the initial release has too many similar planes, when variety and congested initial airspace is what makes this game fun. This set at least offers 2 distinct types: front-only and front-and-back-firing planes. It might have taken a liberal assignment of manouevre decks just to assign a deck to each plane. But that'a concession I could easily live with.

If you go for one set only I would suggest this one over Famous Aces. But to get the most out of it I recommend getting as many sets and decks as you can get your hands on. Invite some mates, create teams, clear the table, then the air.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pretty fun as long as you're dogfighting with more than two planes.  I wish I could have found Famous Aces, instead.  The big planes with the rear gunners in this set can be a tough challenge, though.  

Update: Bought Famous Aces and yes, the original is a better game.  Watch Your Back by itself is probably a 5 or 6.  Combined with Famous Aces, it's a 7.

More ariel goodness.  Two seaters at last!  The only problem is the two seaters were designed for actual missions, not the dogfights regularly engaged in here, and to make them less unstoppable, optional rules are needed, and even they don't work so great.

RATING: 7
Been looking forward to this for ages. We broke it out the other night, doing the 2:2 Escorts vs. Interceptors. Having a variant mission was cool, but we got whacked by that old bugbear, game balance: some of these fighters are crap. Especially compared with the two-seaters, which can dish out a lot of pain and are arguably superior to the fighters. Plus the two-seaters can outrun several of the fighters in the box. To recap: the Escorts had better planes, could outrun the fighters, and had more ways to win. This is not so good. The game is really cool, but it would be nice if there were some approxomate point values associated with the planes, so you could at least try to balance the victory conditions.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There's just enough meat to be interesting.  The most attractive aspect is the degree to which all excess chrome, fluff, and other extraneous chaff has been be excised to leave pretty much as minimal a game as could be managed.  My refinement of Mike Chase's variant (see article) further improves that quality.  The surprising thing is that while the maneuver choices are essentially akin to blind bidding, that the impact cost of those decisions is low enough, and the game short enough that what emerges is quite surprisingly and susiciously fun.

RATING: 8
From my memory of Famous Aces (which I haven't played in over a couple of years), Watch Your Back is as good if not better including the rear shooting planes for variety as it does. This game uses ingeniously simple mechanisms to recreate the feel of planes dogfighting and it plays in a nice short time frame. However I do think the game would benefit a lot from more scenario based play. My only real issue with the game is the potential price. I'm really tempted to get a whole swag of expansions to have more planes and decks but at the end of the day I'll still only have a light dogfighting game which can randomly end with the draw of a single card.

The instant death card kills this game.  We had already been a bit annoyed by the way the rules were written (aka "Put the boards in the appropriate place" without explaining what that meant, you don't see the distance between the boards until the scenarios...but it could have said that...) and then to have Jason's plane blow up in the very first battle just gave us a horrible taste.

If that card were removed AND we played with multiple planes (say 4 each) I could see there being fun to this game but as written, with only one set using the scenarios given...nope, not fun at all.  The only reason I'm giving this a 3 instead of a 2 is because there are some caveats where I might be convinced to play it again.

The second game in the Wings of War series adds several types of new aircraft, including two seaters with rear seat observers.  The rulebook is the same as in the first game, so essentially the only new stuff is the aircraft, the B damage deck (which is a half value A damage deck), and four new engine decks (E, F, G and H).  This is a great game.

Pretty cool system for WWI dogfighting using cards. Since manoeuvres are always preprogrammed three turns in advance there is a lot of gambling and out-smarting involved. There is also quite a bit of luck when drawing damage cards, and I guess you need to approach the game with beer and pretzels in mind rather than as a serious simulation. Coming from that angle it works very well.

If you are looking for a set to start with, I'd recommend Famous Aces over this one. Watch Your Back has two-seaters which add a bit of variety, but the box includes only a B damage deck which prevents you from using the A planes and generally makes for longer games.

Good: Tactical Air - WWI - Very Easy

Nice filler or for team play. Mega simple, can be played by anybody and children and excellent to take to Campground / hotel etc. A bit random as you have to draw 3 turns in advance but very exciting, the more now the miniatures come out. With real planes this will for sure go up.

Revisited: no play in the last 18 months. 

Traded away.

Fast playing tactical air game.  The maneuver cards are Ok, but it can be a tad fiddly to move when planes overlap...  [thing=10501][/thing] is head-and-shoulders above this title, and includes altitude and a light campaign system.

Of course the miniature planes of this series can be used for [thing=10501][/thing]!

I really want to like this. But it doesn't seem to flow well enough for me to enjoy it. I realise that sometimes you need to sacrifice something for simplicity but why 3 orders then refresh. Surely a pilot doesn't plan 3 moves ahead and then get to pause and have a re-think. I would have liked to see a rolling order system where you ALWAYS had to plan the third move. I feel that's missed a trick. Still if you like excellent models and a reasonable excuse to use them, here you go.

RATING: 7
This is a great little head-to-head biplane game.  It incorporates differences between some planes, and maneuvering strategy of dog-fights. It is easy to learn, and straight forward to play.  Plays very well with 2!

The downside is that the cards are not as inspiring (but much cheaper) than the miniatures.  I would also recommend not using the altitude rules untill all players have had 3-5 games played.  

Good game, and a good entry into WWI arial combat.  I strongly recommend getting some miniatures if you like this game.

Incredible dynamic. Probably one of the best games I've ever played in my live. It's actually really simple to play (although it gets a while to really understand all the rules, as there are lots of special damage cards), and really easy to get the grip. Using the basic rules (i.e.: not using most of the special damage effects), you may start to play in less than 10 minutes. Probably, the worst thing o the game is that it only comes with 4 maneuver decks, restricting the number of planes you may use (without using house rules), unless you buy new sets of the game.

Edit: Ok, I still find the game frikk'n good, but now I know many other games, therefore, is not one of the best games I've ever played.

Still, as enjoyable as possible, although, the WWII series seen to be funnier (haven't played yet)

See my other Wings of War comments.  Watch Your Back! makes a good second purchase if you already have Famous Aces OR Flying Drachens and want more planes and maneuver decks, but don't want to shell out for all three boxes. It adds two-seater planes and the B damage deck which compliments the A deck found in both Famous Aces! and Flying Drachens.  A second H maneuver deck would have been nice since they are the only two-seaters, but there are instructions online for how to convert other decks into an H deck by removing a couple of cards.

Hmm..  Quite difficult to judge this title.  One thing is sure: it plays much better with 4 persons than 2.
Most important: this game does not make excellent first impression, you don't get this feeling that you want play it more and more.  
And that's rather sad.  Optional rules from the net might be the rescue.  Didn't really have time and patience to test them.

It's a pity that there is such little selection inside the box. The planes and decks in the box don't fit each other sometimes - to use everything one must buy another box and combine them. The game itself might be quite good, but the marketing strategy ruins it for me.

Really liking this so far. The only negative, I think, is it has a tendency to go a bit long with two planes per player but not have enough action with only one plane per player.  It is amazing, however, how this game jumps off the table and comes to life.  The mechanics give a good sense of speed and maneuverability.  It inspires to players to make engine and gunner sounds and that is surely a mark of a successful miniatures simulation game.

Managed to get an 8 player game of this going.  Really good time.

RATING: 9
**A fun, light, dog fight game with style.**

Laughs, joyous bounces of players on their toes, surprise maneuvers, groans and expletives, and sudden turns of fortune combine to make the table top fade off into the great blue of the sky. 

You'll hear the propellers, you feel the scarf flapping behind you, you'll hear the rush of wind in your ears.

Your tail may be smoking, you may have a bandit on your 6 coming down on you out of the sun, you may not land gracefully upon our mortal earth. All you have is your skill, your guts, and your bravery to save you.

There are no trees in the sky to hide behind, no trenches, no tanks, it's you, some stretched canvas, the sun at your back, quick reflexes, straight shooting, and your anticipation that keeps you from crashing into the ground, from being shot down.

A great family fun game that is right up my alley with theme. The blue max, dawn patrol, canvas eagles fly again.

A pure pleasure to play and ingenious in it's handling of flying.

Like wings of War "Famous Aces", this box lacks historical scenarios. But planes with the capability to shoot backwards add something new to the dogfights.

A fairly good lightweight Air combat game. A bit too simple, with no speed and altitude rules (until Burning Drachens and the Dawn of War WWII game). The use of maneuver cards makes it possible to simulate the differences in performance easily and simply.

However, the downside is that you need a copy of the correct maneuver deck for each plane, making it difficult to have more than one example of a type in play at the same time.

And, seriously: An air combat game that doesn't feature any altitude rules at all (*Note: until a later expansion, that is*)? 

WWI may not have been big on energy fighters, but you can't fight in the air without the vertical

I have always been fascinated by WWI aerial warfare. Something about having the guts to get aboard a machine made of wood and canvas and exchange gunshots in mid air just goes to the crazy and careless side of me.

I like this game very much, but not for two.  With two it is just turning circles.

06/26/06 Received. Many have complained this isn't a whole game; that you are almost forced to buy other games in the series to have enough planes and maneuver/damage decks to play a ‚Äúsensible‚Äù game. The answer isn't a straight yes or no, but falls into that gray area in between. You *can* play Wings of War with just one of these sets, but its rather unsatisfying and very limiting. I initially bought Watch Your Back! and Burning Drachens but then felt I *must* buy Famous Aces to have what many players would call a complete set. Is this sneakiness on the part of the publishers, or simply economic reality (what you can realistically put in one box for a reasonable price). Probably a little of both.

For a game that uses a 'ruler' to measure distances from here to there, it has a system of movement that's very easy to mess up.

This is like the others in the series. You need interested people who can visualise the whole dogfight thing. I like to programmed movement aspect (like roborally without the chaos)

Plays in around 20-30 mins. Fast action with very little downtime (an egg timer can speed up those that need help with their decision)

I like the scenarios and the historical theme...This captures that knights of the sky felling well.

I think this series gets low scores because the boxes look kind of empty. I think this game is not about what's in the box but what you get out of the box.

For those planning to play this game, it is worth playing this on your own a couple of times before challenging someone else to play it with.  This is so that you can get a good understanding of how to get your planes from A-B without getting shot to pieces in the process!!  Will definitely play again when I get a chance.

While technically a separate and complete game, this is only really worthwhile when put together with Famous Aces.  Furthermore, I dislike that this is the only way to get the B damage deck.

Overall though, its still Wings of War, and its still very fun.

This set adds a B damage deck.  Other than the damage deck and the types of planes that can be played, this set is the pretty much the same as Famous Aces.  I'm still enjoying playing this with my WWI airplane obsessed father.  For that reason, on top of the fact that Wings of War is an enjoyable game, I rate Wings of War very highly.

SECOND INSTALLMENT IN THE WWI AIR COMBAT SERIES -- If you do not own Famous Aces that is the one to purchase first if the series interests you.  Watch Your Back is unique in that it introduces the recon aircraft with rear swiveling machine guns.  Watch Your Back is the only package that includes the B damage deck for the single machine gun (which will do plenty of damage I might add).  What makes this annoying is that other sets include aircraft that use the B damage deck - I find this a rather annoying marketing ploy.  That said I really enjoy playing this series with my kids and sought out a copy.

 little disappointed with this set because you can't fight two rear firing planes against each other.  The B damage deck isn't as brutal as the A so the duel last longer.  Okay, addition but I'm not sure it's better than the original nice to have some different planes though.

I've only ever played 2 player games when each player only flew 1 plane. Definately feels like it needs more aircraft and players. As such, I probably won't play it much unless I can get more players.

However, I'm impressed with the rules and think it would be great fun with good replayability if it was a big dogfight. I like the rules regarding the different types of damage such as engine fires, smoking aircraft, and rudder damage. I look forward to playing this with more players in a chaotic dogfight.

But as to the game - we've added it to the WoW mix with good results.  The kids like the asymmetry of mixing single- and two-seaters.

RATING: 7
Second half of the Wings of War card game. I refuse to call it a whole base set, as it just includes too little of everything, and some planes for which you don't have manoeuvre decks.

With both sets, you can finally make some more interesting scenarios with 8 planes in the air, and it starts to be a good filler, playable even with small kids.

Of course, the game really shines when you add Wings of War or Wings of Glory miniatures, which fixes the problem of choosing planes so you have enough manoeuvre decks and adds +1000 points to presentation, but then it stops being an easily transportable filler and becomes a game in itself, especially with optional rules. I always play the WWI variant where instead of planning three moves and then executing them one-by-one, you start with planning two, and then execute one and plan one each turn, always having planned one ahead. It almost eliminates situations where each opponent independently decides to fly in separate direction, requiring future rounds to find each other again. Some other optional rules, including altitude, are included in Burning Drachens.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is the same as Famous Aces, and it adds 4 more manuever decks asn well as rules for rear gunned planes.  It also adds the "B" damage deck and respective planes, which do less damage than their "A" counterparts.  A really nice addition (not expansion, since it can be played alone), although the game takes a little longer than the Famous Aces set due to decreased damage.

Those backward guns are frightening. This adds some fun planes/decks to the game. Plus, I can now play with 10 people! (Or, people just have more plane choices... I doubt I'll ever get to a 10 person game)

RATING: 4
This is a game my Dad loves to play. It's now required that I bring this back with me on each trip.  

The main thing that disappointed me about it is the instructions and marketing.  The back of the box lists this as a full game that every card included can be used.  This is not really the true story.  Each set of Wings of War contains a set of damage cards/tokens.  The planes included use damage cards/tokens from primarily from the set they came with; however, they also include planes that use tokens that come with other sets.  The directions I received with this set did NOT instruct one how to use the planes with a different damage tokens by modifying the value or how many were drawn. (other sets DO include this information.)  

Unfortunately the boxes do not state anywhere what sets include what damage tokens, or what additional sets would fulfill the planes with different tokens.  

If the instructions were fixed and the boxes gave adequate information I would rate this much higher.

This is as good as the base game, which is brilliant, but I can only give it a 7 as they only included one H deck.  This is quite frustrating as you can't actually have more than one rear shooter.  The rear shooters have a distinct advantage so you should have at least one for each team, but not here.

We figured out that the C deck is the same with a couple extra cards added and now can use this, still we shouldn't have to modify the original game to actually use the feature that you are buying in the expansion.

Burning Drachens gets more love than Watch Your Back, but I like WyB just as much.  BD certainly adds a lot of new stuff with altitude, rockets, ground fire, scrnarios, new planes and balloons, but I mostly only use the balloons and I like the planes in WyB better I think the two games are equally good.

WyB stays within the spirit of Famous Aces, while BD adds more stuff.  Both are good, but the simplicity of FA appeals to me, so WyB works for me.

Fantastic game system and mechanism. Remind me of the good old child days when playing on the floor with my toy planes. It is possible to play all from very simple games to very complex war games and it works fine - at least for us - to play without the miniature planes and just use the plane cards. You can easily create your own scenarios and campaigns and add new home-made components if you like (I do!). Only downside is that you quickly want to have all the expansions but I will recommend you to spend your money on them before starting to collect the miniature planes - the game works very well without having them (the miniature planes)

Surprisingly fun game. You get a feel like you are really controlling the moment of a WW1 plane. 

At times it is frustrating (you can be destroyed by one shot, your gun could get jammed and you do not get to do anything fun for a longer period of time but on the other hand this is very much related to history of combat aviation during WW1) but overall it is great experience. I highly recommend trying it out.

More planes, more maneuvering, different damaging.  This is truly an expansion.

The one thing I/we found with this is that the squadron chosen for each side must be somewhat balanced.  "A" damage planes straight up slaughter "B" damage planes even with better maneuverability.  That is of course in a straight on dogfight.  I don't know about some of the special missions.

Great addition but pay attention to balance.

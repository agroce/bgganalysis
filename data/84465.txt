RATING: 10
Tougher than Soviet Dawn - haven't won in about ten plays. Great fun, with good feel for period and place. More emphasis on elements outside of your immediate situation - what goes on in other fronts has a big say on your fate.

RATING: 6.5
This is probably the best of the small SoS and maybe even the best overall. Tight, intelligent and with a lot of decisions make this a very good game.

It might have, for me, less flavour than other SoS but its appeal is undeniable.

1st edition.  Good, fun overview of the Middle-East front during WWI.  Wrote VASSAL module for it due to limited table space at the time.  Interesting choices to make and tricky mini-game (Running the Narrows) makes you commit resources in anticipation of event cards.

RATING: 7
You might think State of Siege games get old after awhile.  I have played 4 others and have to admit that I was really impressed with this one.  Not because of the State of Siege core engine, but because of the chromatic touches added to it: the straits, the Sinai pipeline, the coups, the battles on the other fronts, and resources.  It adds a layer of complexity, but really spices up the game.

I've grown disillusioned with States of Siege games. This is a fine example of just how mindless these games can be while still providing interesting history-flavored gameplay.
I did get about 10 plays out of it before I was done, though.

[u][b]What I like : [/b][/u]

- The easiness of the game system
- The very good flow of that same system
- The length of play that's thus just nice
- [b]The historical content[/b] : a great work!
- The optional rules
- The lightness of the game.
[u][b]
What I dislike : [/b][/u]

- The lightness of the game... because :
- [b]Luck[/b] is too decisive in the end:
- The optional rules give some more flavor, and some little tweaks to prevent the luck side to get the upper hand too much, but it's not enough.
- Take the Narrows event, in the end it's just luck. Yes you can prepare, but you just add rolls, and luck only decides if your game is over there or not. No fun.
- And for the main actions, yes you have 4 to choose from, but most of the time you'll choose the offensive to take the different armies back, because that's very mostly what can make you loose. So you'll throw dice, always doing the same thing, hoping, and with luck you'll win, and without you'll loose. You have to face all the events each game so it's a fixed amount of possible rolls.


I don't know about this game... Will I play it again? Mmmm... not so sure right now, I even thought about selling it. The light side and too much luck part is very much balanced with the historical content which the game revolves around (and the components nice to handle). So it's a dilemma. I like half of the game, theme and content, but the other half is not for me : that kind of gameplay is too anecdotal.

To me, this game is clearly made for those who favor history more than gameplay.

RATING: 8
First Impression: I've played the VPG Gold edition of this game, with very impressive components. The counters are some of the thickest in the gaming industry and feel nice and chunky in hand. My experience with States of Siege games is very limited, having only played one other in the series before. Regardless, there's alot to do in this game. The decisions are tough, with some real opportunities to plan and be proactive. Playing the game with the cards in historical order is a wonderful and interesting way to understand dilemmas faced by the Ottomans in the conflict.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Ottoman Sunset is another enjoyable title in the States of Siege series. The key here is the ticking time bomb of certain events, such as British invasion of the narrows and building of the Sinai pipeline. The British invasion of the narrows feels especially key to the enjoyment. Admittedly, I find that the decisions from turn-to-turn are less interesting than other States of Siege games, but the events--and how the game completely changes based on the order they are turned over--are very well done.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
     I love this game.  It has a lot of replayability and offers the player some tough decisions.  It is especially nice that the cards can be either played in historical order or in semi-random order, making for a lot of variation.  This is a fast-playing game in which the player must balance the need to keep invaders from advancing along with avoiding a political collapse along the national will track.

RATING: 5.7
Rating of 6 after first play. I felt a bit flat after the Royal Navy won. I had the max defence I could have against them. But in this part of the game it was, roll the dice several times, with no decisions inbetween, and I lost the game. To exaggerate how I felt, it was like, roll a dice midway through a game, and if it's one or two you have lost the game. And by the way, your score is zero despite doing well elsewhere.

I felt like, at least with Zulus on the Ramparts, which I love, it's either over very quick or I feel like I've had more of a shot at influencing things with my card play. That said, my Zulus scores are all over the place! With Zulus I like that I get a score and if I have done well in some aspects of the game, it's not a crushing defeat.

Here, I felt like I was doing well on the fronts, and that counted for zip because of several rolls against the Royal Navy.

Maybe I'll be fine with that. Sometimes your efforts do count for nothing when disaster strikes! I did have fun and am itching for a few more plays to see how it goes. Maybe the Royal Navy thing can be over quick, maybe my first play was a bit slower while getting used to the game and checking a few things.

Probably, if the Royal Navy had failed, I'd have felt elated and scored an 8 :D

Second play, I enjoyed this one quite a bit! I saw off the Royal Navy this time but I was thinking already, I am enjoying the flavour more this time and if I lose, so be it.

I kind of like the pressure of the constant rolls and units flipping over to a harder side etc. I think this will have good replay value for me and I like that it feels quite a bit different to Zulus on the Ramparts. I've raised the score to 7.5 and was thinking maybe to 8, but I'll give it a few more plays first.

It is possible the score could go up quite a bit yet. Zulus grew on me the more I played. I appreciated the historical flavour this time more than my first play.

Update after 11 plays: Really enjoying this, have warmed to it. Yes it is random, not a ton of choice, but I like the vibe and have fun with the rolls. I quite like the royal navy thing now, it adds some tension to the early game where you want to build up defences but don't know how soon it will happen or if it will happen at all. I'm very happy I added this, I am sure it will get a lot of plays.

I like how the order of things can vary a lot, with the second and third decks being shuffled in at unknown times. It has flavour while at the same time I hardly needed to touch the rules after a few games. Rating may rise from current 8.5. It won't be everyone's cup of tea, but it seems very well designed to me.

Update after 29 plays: Increased score to 9. Really love this game and my son loves it too. I have enjoyed adding some of the optional rules to give a little more flexibility and a few more things to think about. This is not a game for everyone. If you only like low luck games where you feel you are master of your own destiny this might not be your cup of tea. But if you can get into a theme and ride with the dice rolls, this is a very nicely crafted game with a good WW1 flavour.

After three plays and two wins I'm not sure the tension is quite there in this States of Siege incarnation. I'm looking forward to the sister game coming out this year that can be played alongside this one for one large game, but on it's own I don't think this has many more plays left in it. Still, worth the price and will no doubt get at least some extra life breathed into it with Hapsburg.

The components are, once again, outstanding. I love these Gold Banner releases.

After setting it up and reading rules, it looks to be far simpler and quicker than Malta Besieged (which I had just finished learning and playing). I wonder if it will have enough meat to hold my interest. Of course, I haven't played it yet ...

Edit Sept 2012 - so smooth and zero fat. I'm a fan.

Give it a 9 with an extra point for the terrific support of the designer and his accessibility to answer questions and the robust optional rules he worked up to make a great game even better. Don't deprive yourself of this game's fun and challenge - it has both in spades. The game is fast but never mechanical; you have choices to make that matter, it has endless replayability, and each turn just oozes history. It would be one of wargaming's best kept secrets... but it's too clever a game to stay hidden.

One hundred and twenty(!) plays now. A really nice solo game that builds the tension as the war (game) progresses. Plays in less than an hour (often much less, so the chance to play multiple games in a session). A history lesson each play. Highly recommended. Playing now with the Gold Banner version. Much improved counter and map. Also provides a few optional rules to provide variation.

Cons : 
Due to the nature of the game you do often feel like the game is just playing itself & you're not affecting the course of the game that much so it can sometimes depend on whether you draw enough good cards first

Light for a wargame, medium for a solitaire strategy game, so it depends upon how you classify it. Another winner in the States of Siege series, and nice to see the original designer putting another game out. Closer to Soviet Dawn than Israeli Independence, this is a great way to learn about the Near East theater in WWI, or at least stimulate your interest. My only complaint is that if the Brits run the straits too early there is a decent chance that the game will end (even if you *do* have time to prepare).

A small box containing a small gem. Deluxe materials and extra thick counters. It is not a wargame but rather a solitaire educational boardgame about the actions that took place in the Ottoman Empire during WWI. The core of the game is in its cards: diplomacy, military actions, foreign intervention and subversion, naval threats, Western Front effects and many more incidents are included. At the bottom of the card exists a brief story of the historical event which is incorporated into the game mechanics. By drawing a card each turn you implement the event that occurs, move the foreign Allied armies towards Constantinople and take actions or rather react to the movement of the adversary. Your goal is to survive the Great War by keeping the Allied armies at bay without reaching your capital and boost the National Will of the Ottoman Empire. If the card deck has been exhausted and you are still on the map, you win. A simple and fun game keeping you tense and focused on your objective. If the die loves you then you will sure have a pleasant time with this one.

Along with deck builders, and mechanics first euros, i've struggled to get into solo games.

This is one of the better solos i played. Its historically evocative and i like the theme. However after about 10 plays i felt done with it.

For £20 the components are pretty poor. The print quality is on par with my office printer. I accept that the card stock can't be the best given their business model but i don't feel i got my monies worth.

This is my second state-of-siege game (Legions of Darkness was the first) from VPG. I enjoy Legions of Darkness more than this one. This game feels a bit more abstract than LoD. In addition, it seems that luck has much more of an effect on the game's result.
The historical theme of the game is great. I enjoy learning more about WWI as I play. The game can be exciting as long as you get far enough into it - there have been some games where my dice rolls were so terrible that it just didn't matter what my strategic choices were. The nice thing about that is the game plays quick and you can just play again. However as I said, the die rolls seem to play a large part in your success or failure.

This is a very challenging game.  It's more complex than Levee en Masse, the only other State of Siege game I've played so far.  You have more choices to make on a given turn and you really need to proactively prepare for specific cards.  It's a fun game, but I enjoy Levee en Masse more.  Both are excellent.

After about 5 plays:  This game tends to feel more random than Levee en Masse.  I do think I like the other more.  Wish I still had it.

I'm finding this game frustrating.  It feels like more often than not it's entirely a game of chance.  It feels like I have very little control.  The process of playing is fun.  The outcome of each game is disappointing.

Very random game with few decisions. Roll dice, roll more dice, and hope the cards come out in a favorable order. The "Forcing the Narrows" thing is particularly annoying. There's a good chance that card will lose you the game immediately, even if you prepare for it - but there's a 50% chance that the event won't happen at all.

God forbid the Kaiserschlacht card should come out early, because that will add a bunch of tedious dice rolling to the end of every single turn for the rest of the game.

Plays quick and easy.  A great "super zoomed out" view of the Middle East in WWI.  The cards and dice make it totally random, but the narrative is really interesting.  I feel like the British Fleet is just "too good" as I've only defeated it once and lost to it much more than that.  There are a few little other "annoys", but on the whole it's a great game in a good system.

This was my first States of Siege game.

A quick and fun solo wargame. You are the Ottoman Empire, fighting a losing battle on multiple front during WWI. Card draws dictate what you must react to as well as give you action points. You must decide how best to spend those points across numerous threats.

Interesting way to pass twenty minutes or even five if the rolls are bad. I consider this more of a puzzle with historical references to the game's namesake, which are really interesting. Good to have when you're fixing for a quick, fun albeit frustrating war game (I still prefer puzzle) with a lot of luck and some strategic decision-making thrown in.

I haven't touched this game in six months. I no longer see the appeal in having it. I lowered the score accordingly.

So far I have played two games from the State of Siege series: Keep Up the Fire and Soviet Dawn, both give me favorable impression.  I should say the series captures the very historical moments as game subject with quicker reaction to the market demand, meeting the pressure to produce more gaming value with less participant time.  In this regard, VPG has been really doing well.  

Uncoordinated attacks from multiple directions, random but atmospheric historical events, central line of communication, constant crisis, trade-off theory, easy set-up and controllable time to complete, solitaire-friendly - these are all the strong features that the series did and has done well.  If you are interested in these features, definitely you would find at least one game from the series that suits and inspires you.  

On the other hand, I am not saying that the series is all that perfect.  Something that alludes me from completely satisfying with the series.  Four things spring to mind broadly: 1) the extent of historical reach that a single focal point on the map (e.g. Moscow in Soviet Dawn and Peking Foreign Legations Compound in Keep up the Fire) forms the sole military objective, expounded by linearity in history; 2) the flexibility of the decisions you have in allocating resources among various shifting fronts (often 5 of them) faultlessly; 3) doubtful chance to win against the "AI", whose behavior is constructed based on pre-determined odds in the card deck, and in case you did manage to win, whether it is the pure luck of dieroll or card draw, thus beating the luck of history, or simply it is your genuine strategy of beating the "deck" by card-counting or flawless navigation through the historical events, while calculating the probability of the time to come up with that not-yet-happening event; 4) the questionable tradeoff between the National (or Political Will for that matter) and the resources given up by player's choice.              
 
The bottom line of State of Siege series is that it has been built on academic model of threat analysis and players are often making the choice of doing right reaction to the threat based on its level of significance.  So it is fun like reading a good book of narrative history, capsulated in different composition every time of game play.   

For a balancing view, you should check out the excellent piece of Designer Notes here:

RATING: 3
I don't know where all the fuss about the States of Siege series comes from - I didn't play any other games from the series, but this one is just too random for my taste - no meaningful decisions, just rolling in hope to push those counters away from their destination. Even having only 20 minutes to spare I think I'd easily find a better solitaire game, or play a few turns of some longer one. It's a solid concept and quite thematic for what it is, but the mechanics are too simple and random and not really interesting for me.

In spite of the fact that I'm not interested in this subject (or at least I was not till now :-))), I just had six plays in a row... and every one was so different... amazing... The system is so easy and it takes just 25-30 minutes to complete! Also, this is an easy and fast system to learn history!!!
Updated and upgraded to 9 after 11 plays: it's a very fun game!
Updated after 16 plays: it's a challenge and more I play more I enjoy it.

RATING: 9
Excellent! Best solitaire game I own. Sets up and plays in less than an hour, and offers fun decision making. I've also learned a fair amount about World War 1 from playing it and reading the historical flavor on the event cards. 

It's HARD to win - I think I've only won twice in maybe 20 plays. Oddly enough though, it doesn't feel unbalanced, because so many of my losses have been near-victories. So while my win/loss ratio is far more skewed than in, say, Zulus on the Ramparts, I consider this game to be better balanced than ZotR because every game of OS is tense and fun, while a fair number of Zulus games are either absurdly difficult or ridiculously easy.

RATING: 6
I managed to win my first game just barely, I think largely because Gallipoli and Salonika happened very late.  I like the phased-in decks representing early, mid and late war.  The only thing I am not sure about is the mechanism for devoting resources to the other theatres.  Seems to add a lot of die rolling and minimal player decisions.

After more plays I think there is just too much luck.

RATING: 8.6
Very much like Soviet Dawn and that's not a bad thing.  Has a similar feel; but at the same time, is different enough to capture the feel of the Ottoman military/political leadership.  'OS' gains a few more bells and whistles than some of its predecessors, but it seems the new bells and whistles have less of an effect on the overall game.  This is still an excellent game, but just doesn't have the same oomph that 'SD' does.  Solid 8.5/10.

I really like this game, even though I have only won twice out of all the times I've played (roughly 15).

一个有趣的游戏。本游戏作为一个单人游戏设计得很好，最精妙的是把握了玩家的心理。本作很好的诠释了系列名——四面楚歌。面对众多的敌人，土耳其要竭尽全力抵抗，虽然大多数时候都是失败，但是，玩家总会觉得自己是有机会的，如果稍微改变一下行动，或者骰子点数大一点，或者卡牌换1张，都有可能继续坚持。因此，我很愿意在茶余饭后，花费15-30分钟玩一局。另外，这个游戏的卡牌上印有历史事件说明，读一遍顺便也就学习了历史，可惜中国大陆目前在这方面还缺乏意识，历史教育有待加强呀。

While the Western Front in World War One is the most well known, it is the fall of the Ottoman Empire that is still being felt today.  Set amongst this turmoil Victory Point Games has released Ottoman Sunset designed by David Leviloff.  The game is a part of the States of Siege series of solitaire games.

The player is in charge of the Ottoman Empire trying to juggle the many threats that the Allied forces are sending your way.  Armies will begin by marching from the Caucasus, Mesopotamia, and Sinai.  As you turn over cards to determine events and your enemies actions, as well as how many actions you can take, you will find armies landing in Gallipoli and Salonika, and an Arab revolt marching on the capital as well.  The English will try and force The Narrows and major battles in other theatres will threaten to demoralise your people.

Each card you turn over tells you which enemy armies move closer towards the capital, and how many actions you have to try and fend of the various challenges thrown your way, though as the game progresses you will never have enough actions to do everything you want.

With your actions you can launch offensives to push enemy armies back, send resources to other theatres, add defences to The Narrows, and once it’s on the map move the Intelligence Bureau of the East to different countries.  Trying to survive through the three decks of cards is a real challenge.  You don’t get a chance to do any real long term planning you just have to deal with things as they come up.  

It must be said that people who hate randomness and chaos will not enjoy this game.  Events happen at random and everything is resolved by a die roll, so your fortunes will wax and wane based on how the die is rolling.  Personally I don’t mind this at all, also the game plays so quickly that losing to a die roll just means starting again.  For example, while my son had his dinner I played three games in a row while supervising him.

This is a fun game that plays really quickly but still forces the player to make tough decisions.  Ottoman Sunset has also made me want to check out other games in the States of Siege series.

My second SoS after WMTTE, and I think I like this one better. WMTTE seemed to steer me into decisions with so many DRMs on the cards. Also, the topic of OS is less known to me. It's hard (easy to make a solo game hard) and quick enough that I find myself wanting to play just one more time for the evening. 

All that being said, it doesn't really convey the theme aside from card text. Change the surface and it could be about anything.

RATING: 7.25
A good solitaire game, illustrating the difficulties of the Ottoman Empire and the Eastern battles in World War I. In terms of gameplay I really like how the game is about more than just pushing back various fronts, you have to keep your National Will up, and prevent the british from running the narrows. I like how different tracks will change strength, appear and disappear throughout the game. The chaos helps ensure that no two games are alike.

In this SoS offering all roads lead to Constantinople. As with all SoS games, to secure victory a delicate balance of limited resources is required. Though you never really know if you will pull off a win, imminent defeat can be clear as day.

Game 2: Marginal Victory (17 points)
Game 3: Strategic Stalemate (4 points)
Game 4: Marginal Defeat (16 points)
Game 5: Crushing Defeat (Narrows Forced)
Game 6: Operational Victory (23 points)

Remember to play with a red die with white pips.

SOLO GAME RE WW I NEAR EASTERN FRONT -- This is the second title in the VPG State of Siege Series that I have tried, the first being the somewhat more complex Empires in America.  Here you play the Ottoman Empire trying to hang in against MANY opponents with some help from the Germans.  It is an interesting history lesson wrapped in a fun and accessible game.  Very easy to throw down and get a game in after dinner.  Recommended.  Unless of course being routinely whipped by the game bothers you, in which case it is NOT recommended.

The game is thematically rich and engaging despite have low player agency and high luck.  Despite the problems I know are there, I find it pleasing to play and tense in places.  There certainly are tough choices that matter -- just not as many as the game tricks you into believing.

It's not a burden to refresh the rules, it's quick to play, and it's compact to store -- so it's a fine game to play a bit on occasion, if not one to play many times in sequence.

update:  The second edition includes several variants that add more choices and more complexity.  It's a nice addition and a nice edition.

Terrible components, sleeving the cards makes them much easier to shuffle and separate.  Smallest die in the world, really comically small, careful you don't inhale it.

Fun play that encourages you to keep coming back.  Interesting historical information on the cards.  Despite being so random I really enjoy this - I don't understand why.  Hoping that with more familiarity with the cards it'll get a bit less random, in which case the rating could go up.

--

About 15 plays now.  Have won about 4 times including once with the historical variant.  The component quality no longer bothers me at all (with the sleeved cards), and I appreciate that you can play in a small area.

I've taught this to 3 people now, all enjoyed it.

More of an entertaining educational experience than a deep strategy game, since success depends so heavily on dice rolls. That said, it's a fun way to spend 10-15 minutes. And since almost any outcome is more successful than the historical one, even a Pyrrhic victory feels like an accomplishment. Read all of the event text and treat it like an alternate history story.

Really impressed. Simple, fun, solo play, with enough things going on to give a real feel of tension and difficult decision making.

And holding on is all you can hope to do, because defeat is constantly looming on every front!

This game is my first foray into wargaming. I find it very fun, and addictive. It's pretty easy to learn - the cards determine the enemy actions, and then you decide your actions, and hope for good dice rolls. There is strategy involved - do I attack a front, or add defenses to the straits, or boost one of the Off Map battles, etc.?

The bonus to this game is the historical text on each card - you actually learn about the history of the Ottoman Empire during the early parts of WW I.

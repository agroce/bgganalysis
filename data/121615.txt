Shadows Over The Empire feels a nearly game to me.  The idea of starting with a single character and using their influence to build a faction is quite a nice one.  Despite card text to read, fail to remember and read again, the game rattles along at a brisk pace.  You can also see some nice thematic links between a character's special power and their alignment. That said, with three or more players there are so many special powers in play that the game becomes quite chaotic; players build up their factions, there are back and forth struggles, and then it just ends.

The card art is quite gorgeous and production quality is good.

RATING: 6.5
Its a card game with medieval theme. Players are trying to influence various characters. The rules are tight and easy to teach. Each character has a unique ability so you have to think well which ones you should try to take under your control and how to use best their powers. The game seems to have enough replayability since random characters are dealt at the begining in order to make the 'board'. There are no random elements in the game, apart from the initial setup, so you can try to plan several moves ahead. On your turn you can only take 1 action so things move quickly. Playtime is about 10 to 30 minutes depending the number of players.

Area control game with special abilities. Very fast, cutthroat and fun overall. Would play again.

RATING: 5
Card combinations, leader bashing, "whack a mole" "take that" kind of interactions on a grid of randomized cards. If that sounds fun, then you might like this game.   Obviously a lot of time and love went into the design of the beautiful cards, but this is just not my kind of game.  No desire to play again.

A very well playtested area influence game with carefully chosen abilities, which is the main aspect of this game and makes it shine.
For the artwork:
excellent illustration skills.
I would like the informational icons to stand out more though. They blend in the colours of the illustration a bit too much.

Beautiful game. The luck of how the cards are set up doesn't fit to a strategy game and can leave you without a chance to win. Wouldn't touch it with more than 2 players as it might end up in a stale mate.

RATING: 6
Initial rating after two plays.

With three players and the "A" cards we ended up in a never-ending cycle of no one winning. This was probably in part because we had not played before. It would also have been different if we had the Law character in play to remove tokens from conflicts.

With two players it ended very quickly with little interaction between the players because of the cards available. 

Still, it is fun and I need to play it some more for a solid idea on the rating I want to give it. It could be anything from a 5 to an 8 after a few more plays.

Others say:  AVOID.  Too long with high AP potential and dull back-and-forth struggles as players block one another and fail to make forward progress, abrupt ending, starts okay/simple (single character with a power) but becomes chaotic, must keep track of 17 card abilities at once and memorize what opponents can do (nearly impossible to form a strategy), small text and bad/small icons on cards that make the "board", boring abilities in the A-deck (e.g., place/remove token, rotate card, etc.), imbalanced set-up (random, luck-heavy) and imbalanced abilities (esp. leader abilities), maybe better with experienced players but probably not worth the time/effort.

RATING: 4
The artwork is very pretty, but we've found the game to be lacking.

It's difficult to keep an overview of all the card abilities, especially when half of them are facing the other way or are turned sideways. And you really need to keep an overview of the card abilities to play this game.

The leaders' abilities don't seem to be properly balanced (for example "remove up to 3 tokens from a character card in conflict" is much better than "subdue a non-religious character").

All our games have been over very soon (turn 2 to 4) when nobody had any actions left to stop the one who was about to win. We thought we might have been playing wrong, but I read the rules (and the BGG forum) over and over again and found no mistakes.

I guess that knowing all the characters' abilities would help prolonging the game, because the players could better anticipate what their opponent(s) can do. But I don't want to be playing this until I know all the cards, and even then, it would become a game that you cannot play with new players.

This game is quite confusing and quite boring… It sucked quite a bit with 4 players and all of the 25 cards that you kind of need to know what do if you want to win… SotE probably wins something if you play it repeatedly, but I have to admit that I didn’t really read or cared about what the various cards did, because it would have been way too troublesome and result in too much AP (which one of the players unfortunately did, bah)! If we played it repeatedly, the game would be smoother, but there isn’t really anything that makes me want to go back. 

I guess the beginning of the game is the most exciting, but as soon as somebody is close to winning, the game becomes somewhat stale and kingmaking problems will happen as you choose who to attack… And once a player is close to win, there are lots of cards which remove influence/tokens which results in the game dragging on…

The different factions don’t seem equally balanced (everybody thought so); the one I was, where I could remove 3 tokens in a conflict, wasn’t used in every round, which the other players’ powers were. And even when I used it, I had to choose who to harm the most. Another character push you in a certain direction (the one which blocks actions on the prince), so we felt that the role played you instead of you playing the role and choose your own strategy.

Shadows over the Empire is a complex game with a lot of bookkeeping required as you play. But, boy, do I like it! The character powers are interesting and unique, the ways you can use your cards make for interesting decisions and the artwork is fantastic. I prefer it as a two player game, but I don’t mind playing with more. Maybe I am biased, since it comes from Greece, but I absolutely love it.

An interesting game where you have to adapt your plans constantly as other players interfere. But still rewards care and planning. Getting more actions than your oponents helps, but they do need to be the right kind which takes time to work towards. Very enjoyable even at beginner difficulty.

Great game -- excellent components, wonderful art, and fascinating game play.  They also created this game so that players can build on the complexity of the game once they understand all of the mechanics -- a well thought-out strategy.  In each round there are always so many possibilities that you are constantly evolving your strategy.

The somewhat interesting artwork drew my attention, but unfortunately the game is boring and simply doesn't work. I liked the surprising simplicity of the gameplay (on your turn, influence a character or use the power of a character that you control), but any goodwill I had was defeated by the terrible production design. When will publishers learn that a lot of unique cards with lots of text, especially when they are put on display all across the table, is not a good idea? There are a few icons that are supposed to help, but they are minuscule (despite the large size of the cards) and don't say much, being practically useless. Also, the special powers, at least in deck A, are pretty dull: place or remove tokens, swap or rotate cards, that kind of stuff. The rules say that the other two decks have more complex powers, but I think this will only make the constant reading more painful. And the random setup can be really imbalanced, deciding the game before it starts. My only game lasted two rounds and left me with no desire to play again.

Tons of strategy and replayability with the initial layout of the characters randomly selected for the set-up of each game. Many of the characters have special abilities that can be used in combination with other characters on the board- and identifying and controlling those combos is a huge part of the game. A lot of fun and a lot of strategic depth. One bad move can cost you the game so be careful in your decision making.

RATING: 6.5
* Kickstarted! *

Use the powers of one card to affect other cards in hopes of getting all your influence out there. The challenge comes from trying to find the right combinations to slow your opponent down -- with the more you try to stop your opponent, the better the game becoming. Not one you want to play repeatedly, though.

PLUS: oversize cards have beautiful art, game requires strategy
MINUS: luck of draw and focus on yourself can cost you the game

This has probably got way too much bad rap here, based on my couple plays. At least for two it can be a fun tug of war. A couple broken combos, but there are some in better card combo games too (such as my fave RFTG) so it's really not that big of a deal.
It's good if you're into this kind if stuff, but for my tastes it's a bit too much of a tactical puzzle and revolves around trying to spot the winning combo.

The art on this game is stunning, but my husband didn't enjoy the game play. While I liked the mechanics fairly well, and thought it was an area-control game that worked well with two players, the game was much too short. It ended up feeling unsatisfying for me. It almost stayed in our collection, but I knew it wasn't going to get played enough to justify keeping it.

AWFUL. The first half of the game the players play solitaire, snaking out from their starting points. When they finally meet, there is a tug-of-war that leads to an unsatisfying end. I hope I just didn't "get it" because I hate to think such an experience was intentionally published, but I'll not be talked into playing a second time.

RATING: 6.5
Interesting game which plays quickly, but only if played with two, and players can read the texts on the cards. Minus points for the great amounts of text and the necessity for all players to know exactly what everyone does, the complex language used, the lack of symbols instead of text, and the somewhat frustrating issue with using all your tokens (which is the point of the game), and then not being able to do much anymore, making the gameplay change greatly in the later rounds of the game.

My first and only play of this game left a bad taste in my mouth.  I really wanted to love this, special card abilities, back and forth tug of war for spots, interesting card layout, however the game is kind of broken it felt.  

The tug of war...never ended in our game?  It was a 3 player game and it just felt like it was going on forever.  I would like to try this game again, but it seems to be quite an up front learning experience before you start enjoying it a bit more and there are TOO MANY GAMES!  

Perhaps will try again in the future before saying good-bye.

RATING: 6.5
The Good: 
·) Cool area control concept and mechanisms
·) Simple rules (manual could be drafted better though)
·) 100% replayability (many characters in the game, only a few of them get used each round)
·) Plenty of interaction
·) Art is simply fantasic

The Bad:
·) It's a 2 players game. With more players, you lose too much control and there's way too many possibilities to factor for any kind of medium-long term planning to be worth the while
·) Slow gameplay, the game is thinky and you must at least double its lenght if you're not a veteran (read abilities + think)
·) Concern: starting cards' powers could be unbalanced (Bonafatius seems to be way powerful)

The Ugly:
Another Artipia game whose concept is really attractive, almost as much its georgoeus art, but then it doesn't deliver.

PS: I started with an initial rating of 7,5 in Jan 2014, and dropped it progressively until the final 6. I really wanted it to be good, but right now I'm selling it.

Essen '13

We had a bit of a four way tug o' war going on, and we didn't really get any of the cool combos that they talk about in the reviews (that I watched afterwards). So this definitely needs another try, because the way we played it, it was basically kingmaking all around - in the end one of us won because another one of us made a mistake in preventing the win.

We played again 2p, and this time it was over two rounds. 

Seems a bit unbalanced over the different number of players so far. And not sure about the balance of the different A starting characters either. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Well, I hope we did something wrong, because my 1 game so far wasn't that great: it lasted only 2 rounds. In the first round I did 1 action: influence another character. In the 2nd I did 3: influence 2 characters and used 1 ability. And then the game was finished :(

Reason: All the face-downed characters touching my corner weren't accessible for me and the abilities of the characters around my leader weren't useful to change anything about that (no swap or something like that) :s

Edit: second play on 8/11, and again the same problem, finished after round 2. Instead of playing this game, you can just shuffle cards, read them and determine the winner in advance based on who has the best cards around his leader. Clearly a broken game!

I'm very conflicted about this one.  On one hand, I love it.  I like the art, I like the idea, I like the theme, I like the game mechanics.  BUT, my wife seems to absolutely hate it.  I don't understand why.  She finds the influence action to be terribly confusing, and difficult to grasp tactically.  
I don't know.  Sometimes she's like that with some games.  I mean, I've taught her much more complicated stuff, and she's enjoyed them.  But every once in a while...something like this comes along, and no matter how quietly, patiently, and repeatedly I explain it, it just doesn't click with her. See also: Libertalia.   
Which sucks, because my dad spent a fortune on getting it shipped over to the states for me.

I only played a short two player test game at Spiel13 so far.
Great graphics! I like the influencing mechanic and the actions the characters you control may do by exhausting them. However, during the explanation of the game, I'm afraid I haven't compleley understood how the influencing works. I also like that the game may be played also with 3 and 4 players, and think it would play well with these numbers of players. I' d like to play it again. With more players, and I want to see the other characters and their actions. To me it looked like there were lots of additional characters to play with, except for 12 we had in our two player game. So the game offers a lot of varity.

11-09-2014. Rated after 1 play. Fun game about controlling characters and taking special actions. While it's a little fiddly due to a mass of tokens it's a fun game. It's not perfect, but it seems good enough.

This game is from my play group 5net. I'm just the keeper of games :-)

Uh, this is so messy game, when we played in 2 players it was almost ok, but in 4 players, oh my, I don't think it can be finished in 120 minutes if you play right.
I don't like it.

The more I play, the more I like this game. Artwork is hands-down a 10 for me, a round of applause to the designer for it :D
Easy to learn, seemingly impossible to master; one mistake brings your faction to ruins though, so you need a lot of time to decide your next move. Highly strategic, an awesome brain-teaser.
The rulebook should be a bit more clear on fiddly matters (like eg. passive abilities and reactions) although most of these are deductible.

Wow what a visually stunning game. Beautiful cards and a good size and quality too. 

Originally backed this Kickstarter for the artwork but soon discovered that it's a game of great strategy and depth as it comes with 3 levels of skill cards. 

Rules are a little vague but there are very helpful play thru videos online.

Fairly thinky area control game.  This is not nearly as complicated as some might lead you to believe, though.  I have only played with the A cards so far, but my first games were not nearly as complicated as my first games of Pixel Tactics, for example.  Pretty fun and great artwork!

I really liked the art in this game (shares it with Archon). Our initial play was enjoyable, though we kind of ended in a stalemate.

I think it plays better with 2 or 3. I feel 4 might be a bit too much.

I would be up for playing this again if anyone brought it to the table, but it didn't click for me in the small number of plays I had, and I rarely play games at its' best player count (2), so it got sold on.

This game needs another play before I can give it a final rating.  The rules were a bit ambiguously written and some of the characters were as well that we're not sure how correctly we played this game the first time around.

This game is an area control game played with a grid of character cards.  Each new character you influence gives you a new ability and allows you to spread your influence more.  The main goal is to influence the "Distinct Personality", or the character in the center of the grid.

I do wonder if this game wouldn't be better as a duel between two players.  With 4 the game can get quite chaotic and sometimes a player can slip through the cracks unnoticed and steal the victory because there are so many characters across so many people to keep track.  But I also like this chaos sometimes and also worry the two-player version of this game might feel a little too confined in what you can do.  I won't know for sure until I play with 2.

The game was a bit reminiscent of Nothing Personal, the way you influence characters to use their abilities.  Except in this game you need to be the sole person with influence on a character to control them, not just have the most.  It kind of devolves into a tug of war but an interesting tug of war where you have lots of options and ways to use those options.

The variety is nice once you start using all the cards and the artwork is also stylistic and very cool (same clockwork people from Archon).

I very well may like this more after played as a tighter game with the proper understanding of the rules and character interactions and it may be a great 2-player game.  We will see.

I really like Artipia's art style. It's a bit busy and not always the most functional - though functional enough - but always very pretty to look at. And this game offers you a lot of pretty pictures, on huge cards, all with different art on them. Nice.
This game is mostly an area majority game where you get to use the special abilities of the cards where you are the sole occupant. And you get occupancy by placing tokens and kicking other players tokens off. And you do that by using special abilities. Since there are quite a few different cards on the table - though only a fraction of them each game - there is quite some text tot take in and remember. They added icons to remind you of the main function of each card, but you still have to remember how that function can be used before triggering it.
I liked the main idea of this game, but not paying attention will lead to a quick win for the player who is paying attention.
In our game one player was a bit stuck in his own corner because he got a bit unlucky with the initial placement of the cards. There wasn't much he could to to alleviate that, and he ended up in last place.
I would need to play this a couple more times, but this first game was a bit of a disappointment.

Initial rating: 6

---------------------------------------------------------

So some people urged me to try this game again because of my less than exiting first play of this. And we also checked the rules again, and it turns out we played correctly.
We tried again twice, once with 4 and once with 3. That last game was with the B and C cards. The game with 4 was again finished in round 2, the last game went slower and lasted till round 3.
But my stance on the game hasn't changed. I didn't enjoy playing this game. And no one else did. It's not because it's a bad design, it's just not the kind of game we enjoy. And each end game felt very anti climactic. Someone gets to a point where they can win, everyone tries to stop them and might postpone the win for 1 or 2 more actions but in the end someone will win, and no one is in a position to do anything.
I also think the play time of 120 minutes on the box must be a mistake. This game took 30 minutes tops. Which is a good thing because I can't see anyone enjoying this for 2 hours. I guess some people will enjoy this as a 30 minute game, but not us.

Revised rating: still 6

Fantastic artwork on the cards. 

I'm still confused about why on the box it says 90-120 minutes when my slowest game so far has been twenty minutes.

Jury is still out on it. I'm really enjoying it, but there's a lot of things to keep track of.

A very well balanced plot game with a constantly changing strategy.

Imagine a board made of characters, which you can recruit to do your dirty work for you. Steal characters from your opponents or just render them unusable, to destroy their tactics. Keep a low profile, make precise moves, hurry but don't be too hasty... You need to exhaust all your influence over the empire, but sometimes it's good to have some more influence capacity...

First Artipia game I don't like :(

I swore as soon as I get 2-3 people to play with the "beginner" deck, I'll switch to the second one. But I haven't found anyone who liked the game enough to play it a second time, and I am starting to agree after the last game dragged out HORRIBLY.

I was expecting chaos, but got something with a little bit of meat and chaining and manoeuvring, with a feel a bit like circling in Infinite City, but without a lot of the randomness from the tile draw. Need to play with the more powerful cards to see how that changes things.

Very nice mechanisms and excellent art. The "problem" with this game is that you need to play it two times with the basic cards before you know what is happening, or how it is happening. An experienced player will bit any time a newcomer.

Great game in many way but lets itself down in some key areas.

Absolutely amazing artwork and a nice theme. Highly strategic and rewards creative play. A lot of diversity in setup options add a huge amount of variety between plays.

The huge downside is that each card has unique powers and there is just too much going on and too many options for the game to flow in a good way. You spend a lot of time each turn trying to read each card and understand what it does, then you often get massive analysis paralysis.

There are also a few confusing rules and pieces of terminology that detract from the game.

After a few plays that people generally enjoyed I found it hard to get to the table because it is just too rules dense for me to be bothered.

It is a fun game and actually one of the most tactically deep games I have ever played, if you can set these issues aside.

I didn't enjoy it very much, since it devolves in a tug-of-war (putting tokens on cards, getting them out again since other players are throwing spanners in your works) and this increases the play time without significantly adding interest.

Nice filler with a pretty high level of replayability and variable complexity.  Only played it with two players and while it wasn't bad, it wasn't great. I suspect that the three or four player version will be much more interesting.

Area control card game. Each player represents a faction of this vulnerable city in disarray. Be the first to utilize all your influence and secure control of the character at the center of the area that is represented by a grid of character cards. Activating a character with influence triggers their special powers which usually has a profound effect on the influence landscape. That is where the strategy lies.

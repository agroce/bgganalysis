Fun pure deck builder. I think Clank! In! Space! will prove to be the more interesting game, though. For now, this is my collection's token deck-builder.

*Rating based on iOS app.

This is the expansion that takes Ascension to the next level.  This expansion adds so much combo material to the game that it puts all the other expansions to shame.  The Multi-Unite abilities, combined with the cards of multiple factions, create combo after combo.  It's fantastic!  If you haven't purchased any Ascension expansions, or if you haven't even purchased the original game, [i]this[/i] is the one you should start with.  It is the pinnacle of Ascension.

I will add two points of warning.  First, this expansion shows definite power creep over the previous expansions.  Most of the cards in this expansion are pretty well balanced (see point two below), but compared to previous Ascension sets, the cards in this one are stronger.  I would recommend not playing this expansion with the previous ones as they do not seem to be balanced with each other.

Second, there is one card in this set that I would call just plain broken: Adayu the Serene.  This is a card that is gained by defeating a 7-cost monster and provides bonus runes, power, honor, and (most problematically) card draws based on the faction of the other cards you've played on the turn, with no cap.  This card can create some ridiculous turns.  I have abused this card to achieve scores in the thousands against AI opponents, but even in human vs. human games, it can result in ridiculous (and lopsided) scores.  If playing the tabletop version of this set, I'd almost recommend taking the card out of the deck.

Despite those two caveats, I highly recommend Realms Unraveled.  I'd even recommend it as a starting point in Ascension for gamers who have played other deckbuilders before.

Deckbuilding is slow and frustrating. Finding the synergies between cards is difficult. At times the board is clogged with cards no one seems to want. The solitaire game is overwhelming and the two player seems to lack any real purpose.

I have a million plays of this (and all the ascension expansions) on android, not going to bother logging them all. But this version is probably the best, plays super well as a standalone set, gives you a little more to think about and discipline/luck can create incredibly tight decks.

Pound for pound, this could be the best Ascension content available. After the fun but mostly-blase cards from The Chronicle of the Godslayer and Storm of Souls blocks, and the un-fun swingy mess that is Rise of Vigil and Darkness Unleashed, Realms Unraveled came in and ramped up the wombo combo awesomeness of Ascension without chucking out all semblances of balance or strategy. Transform was greatly streamlined from its first appearance in RoV/DU and gels perfectly with Multi-Unite, making faction specificity much more effective and thematic than before. 

It's awesome. Period.

I demo'd the base game at PAX East 2015 and thought it was a cool game. I only played for a few minutes before deciding to purchase it, but I went with the Realms Unraveled expansion, based on the recommendation from the man in the store and the demo lady. I played it once I got home and I really like it. I have only played 2 player games against myself, but I think it has potential for my friends, my brother, and Allan to enjoy playing. My scores are generally in the 60-75 range but I got 101 on my last play. Once I play with some other people I would like to expand the game to include new cards. I really love the transforming, I think it's awesome.

RATING: 10
After the slightly lackluster Rise of Vigil and Darkness Unleashed, Realms Unravelled is back on form. The power level is pretty high, rune-for-rune much higher than Rise of Vigil and while comparable with Storm of Souls, more combos and transform abilities make the ceiling higher. That in turn means you'll see a few blow-outs just because one player got the right cards at the right time, but because the higher power level comes from combos and deck development, and not just stronger cards, this works for me and makes the game feel very dynamic. I like it a lot and it's rejuvenated the game for me.

RATING: 6
So -- I enjoy playing this game on my phone, just because it's easy... but I wonder if I'll enjoy it as much with a friend -- I mean it's just a race for points, right? Almost no interaction with each other at all. So basically it's Quarriors, but not as good (at least in Quarriors you're building your "deck" to go fight each other.) Hmmm...

"Full" standalone game.  (NOT part of a "Block").  Adds multi-unite and transforming Heroes and Constructs into more powerful versions. 

All of the sets in Ascension are not particularly deep or strategic.  There is randomness in the way Ascension plays.  But I love the Ascension sets because they're quick to set-up, the  turns are quick, the ease of play, trying new sets mixed together is fun and being able to play cool combo turns when you get some really good cards in your deck is so much fun.

You can get some crazy, powerful combos going on with the Realms Unraveled cards!

This set plays really well mixed with Dawn of Champions.

RATING: 8.5
A fun Ascension release that skips the energy shard mechanic of the Rise of Vigil block and instead allows transformations using faction synergy/abilities instead, though it seems as though the portal deck lacks some of the variety of previous iterations.  Multi-Unite is a fun addition to the gameplay that allows for massive combos.  It really shines when combined with Dawn of Champions.

RATING: 6
I'm very disappointed by this Ascension set.  It changes a lot of things established by Ascension up to this point:

-Purchasing constructs can be risky because if opponents kill certain monsters, you may have to discard the card. There is a lack of contruct affecting monsters in this set. I guess some may like this aspect if you thought Ascension had too much interaction between players. I personally did not, so this change is bothersome for me.  That said, it's just something you should know so that you can properly value constructs.

-Banish effects that affect you rather than the center row can now only target the discard pile. Previously, you could banish from your hand or discard pile. This change is definitely for the worst. It gives you less options. Beyond that, it increases the random/luck factor. I say this because I don't know how many times, I've happened to trigger a discard effect right after the resuffle of my discard pile, essentially wasting my cards special ability. I don't know if the designers found deck culling to be too good and wanted to nerf it, but I really hate this change.

-The graphic design of the cards has changed. I don't know if I like the old or new better. I'm inclined to say the old but that's probably because I'm more used to that style. What bothers me about the new graphic design is simply that I hate to mix this set with older sets, due to the difference in graphic design. It's just jarring to look at.

-The game has now has duel faction heroes. Basically the heroes can now belong to more than one faction and the abilities are tied to what a faction does (void - power/banish, enlightened - card draw/instant kill, lifebound - points, and mechana - relates to constructs). It pretty much succeeds and I kind of like having these in there.

-New mechanism: Multi-Unite. It seems Stone Blade Entertainment wanted to copy off of Star Realms a bit or the Star Realms designer (who was involved in some capacity with Ascension) wanted to copy a mechanism from Ascension. Basically, card abilities provide incentives for you to play cards of the same faction.  It does this by Transforming cards (See Darkness Unleashed comments) or cards providing additional benefits.  While this can be a neat/powerful thing, I feel disappointed in that it partially takes away from the Lifebound factions identity because the Unite keyword was one of their defining features.

As with all Ascensions, it's nice to have something new to play with. Overall, After the Storm of Souls expansion every expansion has had cool ideas that have been marred with disappointing aspects.

Az egyetlen olyan nagydobozos kieg, ami értelmesen vegyíthető az alapjátékkal, ugyanis itt nincs olyan mechanizmus, amit el lehetne rontani a hígítással. Ez agy fegyvertény. Van benne egy-két újdonság (karakterfejlődés, multi unite), de egyik se befolyásolja alapjaiban a játékélményt. Elsőre a mechana vonal itt nagyon erősnek tűnt, de az is lehet, hogy csak nagyon úgy jöttek a lapok. Ki fog derülni.

Get this expansion/version if you want to build degenerate combos that let you draw your whole deck and execute Herculean turns. Ascension is all about swingy-ness and even degeneracy so this does fit right in. However, the Multi-Unite feature is sooooo degenerate that it can often result in extremely long terms that will test the patience of your opponent.

Overall, one of the more interesting sets.

This has replaced Dominion for me. Not necessarily better, but it is a good change of pace after 200+ plays of the former. I like that there are fewer dead cards in your hand. I like that the available cards are constantly changing. I like the choice between focusing on buying and focusing on fighting.

Less strategic and more luck dependent than Dominion. But maybe a bit more fun as well.

RATING: 10
We like all the ascension games, and this one is probably the best.  It's certainly the most intense, and feels meaty somehow while some of the others seem to end early or something.  Love the constructs that require activation and the multi-faction heros.  We play long games: victory condition is achievement of 60 points.

Multi-unite and transformation are great new mechanics and the multi-faction cards are a lot of fun too. Interesting combo potential. Dragged down a bit by it being difficult to get rid of the starter cards, which can make the game very dependent on luck of the draw for your combos happening or not.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (December 2014)

Another iteration in the Ascension series of games, but one of the best IMO. I really like the “Transform” mechanism and the Multi Unite cards are also cool. I have had very high scores using the Multi Unite mechanism, so I’m not sure it is balanced, but it is fun to play.

As a whole, I dislike the whole series because they are mainly tactical, that is, they have lots of uncountable luck. This is a fatal flaw for me and I don’t think I will ever buy any of the games (I also play them on the iPad). To clarify, I dislike that Ascension features a variable market offering, this is not fair because my opponent can buy a different set of cards than me, thank to this you cannot plan, only react. I love static markets a la Dominion

Bottom line, an ok game to play from time to time. It doesn’t even come close to Dominion´s greatness so I will pass.

Current Rating: 6.0

RATING: 7
The transforming mechanic (clearly ripped directly from mtg) is pretty decent. You need to meet prerequisites to make your nuts cards so powerful which keeps the game steady to some degree. The cons though are that the power of cards are drastically increased compared to the previous expansions, making a hand of apprentice even more pants. The biggest downside is that all the void cards only banish cards in your discard pile and not in your hand, leading to luck issues being more common.

21 Nov 2015: Rated 8 after one game.
11 Dec 2015: Increased rating to 9 after 49 plays. I've seen comments that the game is "swingy" but can't agree; we've had a small proportion of games where the winner is tens of points ahead of the loser, but the majority are fairly close, and you can't tell who won until the final reckoning. Two player - might be different with a higher player count.
27 Dec 2015: Still our favourite game of the moment (94 plays so far). Have tried a few games with higher player counts; plays well with 3, quite slow with 5.

I like Ascension; it's a good deckbuilder, but honestly the digital version is SO well done (and one of the few async games that gets async right) makes a physical version obsolete. Even for the social aspect I'd rather pass and play an iPad than fiddle with separating and shuffling all the cards and keeping track of all the stuff.

As for this particular expansion, it seems to really ramp up the combos and swinginess of the game in general. One of my opponents had a final turn that probably netted him over 30 points and seemed to never end. I had a turn similar to that, only not to that extent, where because my first "draw a card" action gave me the right kind of hero, I was able to cascade into other combos. Had it been anything else, not much would have happened. That's a lot hinging on a single card draw.

Since the games are quick, that's not too big of a deal, but they're only that quick if you're playing digitally. Otherwise there's a lot of added housekeeping going on.

Deck building with extra dimensions of strategy- the open market shapes availability that must be taken into account in your strategy.  Balancing the need for deck cleansing, purchasing and combat power, combo creation and victory point acquisition makes for a rich set of decisions unique to each game.  The outstanding iOS implementation helps a lot as well.

RATING: 7
Fits perfectly with the Apprentice Edition, both graphically and from a gameplay perspective; I dont plan to buy other sets so I'm perfectly fine with the variety granted here by multi-unite, dual cards and the transformations.
Some matches are decided by the luck of the draw/cards in the center row - this is a card game, you know - but if you can get past it you can have a lot of fun in half an hour (if you're ok with a somewhat multiplayer solitaire). Plus the artwork, to me, it's really good and evocative.
Among the deckbuilders, it's a very good, simple, playable choice.

A pretty good block in the Ascension line. Feels like they rehashed a lot of ideas from earlier sets, and while it's fun enough to play, it also falls into that uncomfortable niche of trying to be appealing to new players while having a lot of little things to keep track of. Better than Storm of Souls, but not quite as good as Chronicle of the Godslayer and Rise of Vigil.

My favorite of the Ascension expansions, this set introduces card mechanics that focus on type-synergies (i.e. playing multiple Lifebound Cards in a turn gives increasing honor, playing multiple Void Cards in a turn gives increasing attack power, etc.).

I really love Ascension and this is my favorite set that I've tried. I do feel decks ramp up a little faster than in previous sets, but I enjoy that. This set also introduced the new graphic design elements that make separating out people's decks at the end of the game way easier.

I love Ascension, but despite some great mechanics (like a good use of hero transformation), this one is badly broken.

Possibly the best Ascension set. Transform keeps on improving and I like how you can strategically focus on the individual factions. Best played on its own, as the contructs become very vulnerable with other sets.

This set is a bit more complicated using cards that can be upgraded (transformed) and multi-unite which can lead in big chain-combos.

It provides a very pleasant playing experience.

You know how you occasionally get really massive turns in Ascension that swing the game?  This set does that constantly.  It's a roller coaster.  I refer to it as Home Run Ascension because you frequently hit home runs.

A lot of fun.  Not sure I'd want to mix this with the base game.

A super swingy game that kills much hope for balanced competition but provides ample material for casual brawls. Don't take it too seriously and you'll have a seriously good time.

Love this block. Really enjoy how the new multi-unite abilities influence the cards you buy out of the center. No longer is simply 'buy the highest cost card available' the best strategy. It really pays off to get cards that will chain off of one another.

Best game so far was my win with 98-1667 using only this set.
This only goes to show that the multi-unite may be a good ability when spread thin, but when concentrated and playing only this set it get's a little crazy.
This is of course an extreme example, but the ability is very powerful when concentrated into a single set and it creates ridiculous combos - I was able to get from around 50 points in one round to over 1600, just because all of the multi-unite cards.

Not a fan, still prefer Dominion for a pure deckbuilder. This game can come down to the luck of what's available on your turn, plus there are huge combos that make turns take way too long.

My absolute favorite from all the Ascensions so far.
About 80% of the cards are valuable and well balanced.
About 10% of the cards are super over-powered and the remaining 10% are just sort of meh, but hardly any bad cards, which really makes for an enjoyable game (except when one player gets those few really good cards).

Multiplayer solitaire with heavily unbalanced cards.

Like many of the Ascension expansions, this one follows the base game play with a slight twist. In this version, there are cards that can "evolve" into a better form if you meet the appropriate conditions. There's also a slight twist on the unite mechanic, allowing it to trigger for every card that matches. And there's new artwork, new cards, etc., all of which keeps the game fresh.

I enjoyed this, as I generally do with all the Ascension games. I didn't really see much of the evolution aspect of the game, so I'd like to explore that a bit more.

App version; have had lots of plays. This particular expansion is crazy on combos - lots of repeating actions through multi-unite, so not sure I'll want to play it physically!

[thing=157026][/thing] is quite a good expansion, as the two main novelties it introduces are very nice: the multi-unite, as there are now heroes that can work with several factions, and the transformation - one card starts as a weaker version of itself, and, when something is done (like playing a certain type of card, or defeating it, etc), it becomes a better version - sometimes is hard to pull it off, but often is worth it.

As is normal, [thing=157026][/thing] works as an expansion and as an standalone game (but, differently than Return oft the Fallen and Immortal Heroes, it accepts up to 4 players, and has solo rules as well).

While not as good as Storm of Souls (as it makes the game a little more complicated and adds luck to pull of some of the transformations), it is nearly there. Definitely the second expansion to get - but mind the dilution, as my deck is quite huge and eventually is difficult to see some of the features of the expansions.

This game has the same gameplay excitement I used to get from Magic the Gathering but doesn't have a high (and continual) cost investment and focuses all the time on playing rather than a considerable amount of time just planning for the next play.

Even without the feel of MtG, this game is great as a standalone.  I do find that most deckbuilding games appeal to me but this is the undisputed king in my mind.  Dominion is great, Star Realms is good, Legendary encounter games are ok, LOTR based ones are not bad, but Ascension is the perfect one.

As far as Ascension individual sets go, REALMS UNRAVELED IS THE BEST!  It is well balanced between factions despite offering distinct differences between them, offers plenty of high end combination plays, has unique mechanics that do not increase the random chance factor, and it will smoothly mix with absolutely any other ascension set without feeling like it loses something in the dilution (specific card names and specific abilities on the cards are not needed for each card to retain all of its own power).  In fact rather than feeling diluted, it tends to make the cards offer even more cool combination plays in each and every faction.  The pinnacle of balance in the Ascension world.

Cool expansion. This one really encourages you to build a faction specific deck to take advantage of all the new multi-unite effects and hero upgrades. For some reason I can't seem to win a game of this block...

RATING: N/A
This was the first Ascension game I owned and I love it. It is a very fast-paced game and does contain a lot of interesting cards. I think the transform mechanic is clunky, but works rather well. The Disciple and Mantra cycles give players a goal to work towards when building their decks. My main complaint is that the box isn't very well done. The cards should be able to face downwards like the DC Deck Building games as being put sideways does take up more space. Also, 1/3 of the box is literally just a big square hole that doesn't work for storing new cards.

If I'm looking for a two-currency deckbuilder, Marvel Legendary will always be my first choice.

My second choice is short attention span, look a puppet show.

Lo vendí sin siquiera jugarlo porque aunque los Ascension me molan los juego poco y tener 4 básicos me parecía excesivo...

Esta opinión no es muy válida porque no le he llegado a jugar, pero con las partidas que llevo a los otros juegos, tras observar las cartas de este me dió la sensación de que es el básico con las cartas que peor comban entre si y algunas me parecieron demasiado over...

Pero como ya he dicho, no lo llegué a jugar.

Ascension at its highest power-level, showcasing Multi-unite and continuing Transform cards from the Darkness Unleashed expansion. The game feels quite outrageous at times, but it makes for a very fun, if swingy, experience.

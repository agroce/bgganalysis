"even without the real-time aspect this game is tricky to beat"

RATING: 5
One of those games that without the element of time pressure would be dismissed as simplistic.  Players are dealt hands of cards that include various pieces of equipment and maybe also missions that use the equipment.  The goal of the game is to play pile equipment cards in the middle of the table and then the - hopefully completed - mission on top.  Work your way through a whole deck of missions.  The catch is that the group has a backpack with limited space, so you can't simply slap down every equipment card you ever draw.   It's all made easier by the absence of any restrictions on communication. Character cards bring special powers, while more advanced scenarios increase the difficulty.  Ho, hum.

Production quality is good.  The artwork is fantasy generic.

I am somewhat surprised how much I actually like that game.
Very easy rules. It's a more complex memory game with a basic theme pasted on.

Not sure why this game is called Dungeon Time but it's not a problem for me. I suggest everyone to watch the play through videos so they know that this is not a dungeon crawler.

It's great as a solo game as it's quick to setup and quick to play(10-15 min for one game).

I really enjoyed this - but it's a memory game and I know many have an aversion to memory games. Very much a cooperative version of Mama Mia!, if it was played in realtime with no turn structure. Fast, engaging, challenging, and the campaign structure nicely ramps up the difficulty. The hero cards and missions add additional flavor and challenge. Mama Mia! is a great, classic game, and since this is built on the same chassis and seems to have been skillfully executed I'm optimistic this'll be fun to bring out occasionally for a while. The very short playing time is a big bonus.

2017-05-30 : Sometimes you sit down to play a game for which you have zero expectations. Even after the brief explanation it all sounded more like an activity than a game. Then we played it. A light-bulb turned on. This is actually a fun mix of risk-taking and memory and what makes it work is that damned timer which is set to just be 10 seconds too short, or so it seems. We lost our first game, but by now we were charged up and wanted to beat it so we played it a very intense second time and did beat it to cheers from everyone. I like how you can customize the difficulty and how the player powers can be a blessing, but you also have to take them into consideration in the first part of the game. Overall, not much more you can ask from a quick filler game.

I just don't think this is my type of game. Felt really repetitive, scripted, and boring. A co-op speed game is a unique idea, but I'm just not that sure this approach makes for a fun game. Maybe some of the other scenarios add depth but it's hard to imagine. There's something about this game that reminds me of Pit. Just shouting crap out for 5 minutes and having a laugh at the end when you find out your plans were screwed from the beginning. No thanks!

Un jeu rapide est innovant, avec pas mal de mémoire. Des aventuriers partent en exploration et veulent faire un max de missions (10 au minimum). Pour ça, va falloir remplir son sac à dos avec le matos requis mais faire gaffe à ce qu'il ne craque pas sous le poids. Tous les joueurs collaborent pour mettre (dans un temps limité) le matos nécessaires aux missions. Après ça, un petit mécanisme malin nous dit si le sac craque ou non. Le truc, c'est que les missions rapportent du loot qu'on peut dépenser aux missions d'après. Il faut donc mémoriser, dans la première phase, ce que rapportent les missions pour penser à l'utiliser au cours de cette première phase pour pas, dans la seconde phase, se retrouver blindé de trucs inutiles...

Jeder Speiler erhält 7 Handkarten die verschiedene Gegenstände oder Aufträge representieren. Diese Gegenstände legt man in die Tischmitte (nicht Reihum, sondern wer gerade möchte). Sobald man der Meinung ist, dass genügend Gegenstände im Pot liegen um einen Auftrag zu erfüllen spielt man so einen. Nach jeder gespielten Karte füllt man seine Hand auf 7 Karten auf. Dies wird jetzt so lange gespielt, bis der Stapel leer ist ODER bis die Sanduhr (glaub 5 min) durchgelaufen ist!!! -> Ewig Zeit zum nachdenken bleibt nicht!!
Es folgt die Auswertung. Der Stapel wird herumgedreht und eine Karte nach der anderen aufgedeckt. Ein Auftrag verbraucht Gegenstände und diese werden dann aus dem Rucksack entfernt, dafür erhält man dann einen anderen Gegenstand... Falls zu einem Zeitpunkt mehr als 6 verschiedene Gegenstände im Rucksack sind... verloren! Oder sobald mehr als 3 gleiche Gegenstände sind... verloren. Am Ende muss man eine bestimmte Anzahl an Aufträgen erfüllt haben um zu gewinnen.

We had no alpha player problems, as there is a lot of information to account for and players must truly cooperate.

Very fun little game. 
Very easy to explain and fast to play. One round just takes 5 minutes.
There are different difficulty levels and a solo mode. You can also play a campaign.
I think playing it with others is more fun as it's a game where it's important to communicate with the other players.
We had lots of fun and we'd recommend it.

Dungeon Time    Board Game Review.  Publisher: Ares Games   Game Designer: Carlo A. Rossi   Price  $25.00
Passed Inspection: fast paced, fun, nice components, exercises your memory, addicting
Failed Basic:  rules are a little difficult to figure out
Ares Games of Italy is perhaps most well known for being the company behind the Wings of Glory World War I and World War II aircraft game but their product line is growing from other miniature war games such as Sails of Glory to epic science fiction games such as Galaxy Defenders and Euro Games such as Odyssey.  Now Ares gives the card game genre a unique twist with Dungeon Time!
Dungeon Time is a card based game with a twist – for the first phase of the game, there is a strict time limit!  An hourglass which is included in the game gives you 5 minutes to achieve your mission, when the time runs out, the first phase is over and the players then see how well they did.
The theme of the game is that you are playing a character in a fantasy world.  The central piece of the game is communal backpack which you and the other players must fill with useful items and treasure.  Specific cards are story or adventure cards which are grouped by the difficulty of the quest.  Other cards are items such as torches, grappling hooks, swords, shields and such which will help you accomplish the quests.
Each player gets a hand of cards the number of which is based upon the number of players.  The hand is a mix of Mission Cards and Items.  The hourglass is turned over and the players have 5 “real time” minutes to play Mission Cards and then match up the items needed by the mission.  For example, one Mission Card may require a torch and a sword to complete.  The players rush against time to match up the items with the missions.  When the mission is accomplished, it generates another item or treasure.  Then the players play the next Mission Card and they may be able to use the treasure generated by the last Mission Card to fulfill the current Mission Card.
When the timer runs out, the players then take the pile of cards that was created by the Mission phase and lay out the missions and items.  If the Missions are completed, they generate an item which is then put in the backpack.  Items placed in the backpack can be used to fulfill other missions – if they do this, they are removed from the backpack. If  the 8 slots in the backpack are filled with more than three items the backpack “breaks apart” and the players lose the game.
Different difficulty levels make the missions more challenging.  As the “party” of players gets more experienced, they can attempt more difficult missions and even play the challenging Adventure Scrolls which add a whole new level of difficulty to the game.  Legendary Heroes may also be added to the game which helps the party during their quests.
This game is a based on memory and how well the players do under the extreme stress of the hourglass.  Don’t expect to play this game well immediately upon opening the box and reading the rules, you actually need to practice to get good at Dungeon Time! It’s more like mental athletics than a board or card game.
The rules are well illustrated with plenty of examples but even with that, it can take multiple read-throughs to figure out some of the game play.  The Adventure Scrolls were difficult to figure out and an extra line of text in the rule book would have helped with this issue.
The game accommodates solo play or play by up to 5 players.  It’s a great game to bring to a party and it doesn’t take up much table space or time to play. A complete game can take as little as 10 minutes.  It’s very addicting but also mentally challenging.
Dungeon Time is a fun game which may help exercise the old brain cells in way that most games do not.  So head out to the dungeon for an adventure or two and bring a big backpack!  It’s “Dungeon Time”!

Kudos to creator. Very 'mature' and smooth game. 5 minutes of pure frantic coop smart fun. Although usually I don't like memory element, here it just works and I like it. Possibly best 5 minutes game out there :-).

Maybe only minor complain is about size of the package which could be smaller. Otherwise there is no problem.

Admittedly, our group seems to suck at cooperative games.  We get along great, communicate well, and always have fun, yet we almost always end up losing any cooperative game that we play together.  Even so, I love cooperative games and am always excited to play.  Now pair cooperative with real time and it seems like an instantaneous fail for our group.  Truth be told, it was for the first three games of Magic Maze that we played as we couldn’t seem to get past the first level of the game.  Things took a turn for the better in the fourth game and then we progressed through level two and onto level three and actually succeeded!  The concept of this game is so simple, but it’s very tricky to get it all to come together correctly while racing against the clock and trying to remember what is needed and what isn’t.  I also love how the game starts off “easy” and then increases the difficulty with each new level.  That format reminds me of a mobile app and it’s just as additive!  My only quibble is the octagon backpack tile that’s provided doesn’t really look like or cause me to envision a backpack.  It could have just been a rectangular tile that was more reminiscent of an actual backpack with four slots on each side for the cards.  Again, this is a really minor thing and doesn’t detract from my overall enjoyment of the game.  I’ve had a lot of fun playing Dungeon Time with my group and already want to play it more.

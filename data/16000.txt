+ First game I played in the 1825's branch, a lot more about track laying than stock tricks. Very tight map (using only this one, with 3 players) and companies actually being "killed".
- I don't know, I love the stock shenanigans and I missed them.

Played one game with Amanda.  It's a very cramp map.  Currently I think I like Unit 3 more with 2, but I want to give this a few more plays, particularly since it's supposed to handle 3 and 4 and Unit 3 only handles 2.

Update: Currently I'm leaning more towards the 1830 branch and so my ratings reflect that.  That said, I think it's an excellent example of the 1829 line and one I wouldn't hesitate to play.

RATING: 9
Played one game of unit 2 combined with unit 3 and using the K1 extra tiles kit with four players.  The game seemed to be the right size and length for our group.  Seeing how many companies and how much development can get crammed into the midlands I would recommend this kit as the place to start playing 1825 as it's the most straightforward and has the best variety of options going for it - especially the gray tiles and 7 trains.  I think unit 2 by itself will make a fine 3 player game.  Played again this scenario with the phase 4 extra tiles and it's still good, but the tile manifest is maddening compared to 1830/1856/1870.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is indeed very good for 2.  The map is small and tight, and the tile set is also very restricted, making competition for tiles fierce.  Since building the network you want is somewhat difficult due to this, competition for companies can also get fierce.  As 18xx go, 1825 branches off from the original Tresham designs, and is not of the 1830 variety. This means that the stock market is pretty mellow, without any of the "creative destruction" and brutality found in 1830 and others.  Selling shares does not destroy value, so basically the stocks go up - the only way they ever decline is by withholding funds into the company.  This means you have to concentrate more on network building and portfolio management.

Trains are few and resources tight. The bank is also fairly small, so our games tend to top out at 3-4 hours max.  We have yet to get to the 6 train before the bank runs out, so I'm sure our play is still quite sub-optimal.  We tend to try to extend our early companies to the endgame through a viable network rather than manage our late and ending companies better and jump their stocks in multiples.  Basically, we haven't figured out how to plug our late companies into viable networks yet - once we do, I'm sure the 6 train will appear and there will be even more urgency to various tile upgrades.  Certainly more plays will help us develop the necessary foresight where board geography is concerned.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Surprisingly subtle perfect information game.  Very obviously not a German game or a game in pursuit of the German design genre.  The game mostly exists in your head in the number space that represents the various companies and their potential futures.  The economic system has strong "waterbed" qualities (push down here, pops up somewhere else) which would seem to make run-away leaders difficult, but in fact almost masks them from view.  Very interactive in this regard.  

This is a timing game: it is all about owning the right shares at the right times.

Appears very replayable, and again in a rather un-German way due to the subtlety of the waterbed qualities rather than the emergent depth of the rules.  

Beware: Tile choice for the track tiles is astoundingly short/tight for yellow, green and russet

The regionals and their minor companies do a lot to balance and extend the base game in interesting and useful fashions.

One of the tightest two player 18XX games I've seen, and with 3 players promises to be hell on wheels.

I greatly prefer Unit 2 to Unit 3 for two player games, finding Unit 3 too unexpressive for my tastes.

Players invest in railway companies, with majority shareholders becoming company directors.  Players alternate with share dealing rounds (buy/sell shares in companies) and operating rounds (running the companies).  Companies develop railway networks on the map of northern England and Scotland, purchase trains, and run those trains over their routes.  Running a train generates income which can be paid out to shareholders (increasing share price) or held by the company for future expansion (decreasing the share price).  Quite a simple rulebook disguises a rather deep and cerebral game.... and 1825 is considered one of the lighter 18xx games.  If you want to dip a toe in the 18xx waters, this is probably a good place to begin.  Can be bolted to 1825 Unit 1 and Unit 3 for a larger game.

RATING: 7
i can see why this 18xx is so sort after, however it didn't do much for me. It is quite stripped down and easy to play, and does reward good company management, there is little to no stock play in it. The small map does make the game quicker. However it lacked a little colour for me, and at this stage i'm sort of done with 18xx anyways.

This game certainly has interesting things to think about.  I'll need to play a few more times to firm up my views.  In particular, I'm not sure how different it is from one game to another.

I'm not convinced that it's ideal for teaching new players.  The issues it presents are subtle ones, and may be difficult to appreciate until you've played other 18xx games in which the contrasts are more stark.

Played this 2 player.  It wasn't pretty.  I got both the LNWR and NER, and then forced the other player to buy the last share of the Midland, which meant I could open the L&Y and run 3 companies into and out of manchester/Liverpool and slowly rack up the cash.

These games are just too long to get to the table often enough.

One should always bear in mind these are more of a game system and game kit than a game in themselves (at least this is true for the 1825 games).  Player numbers should dictate what you use; chances are if you don't use the right combination somebody is going to be very bored while everybody else runs a company.  Trust me, I've seen it; although to be fair it wouldn't bother me much.

Unit 2 is usually alright for four, but better with three.  Combine with Unit 1 if you're going for five or more players, and expect a very long game in this case.

1825, Unit 2 is another small and short(er) 18XX game. There are two aspects that I enjoy about the game in my very limited experience so far. First, the game plays very well with two players. Second, the reason is that the game is largely an "operations' type 18XX game. Whereas 1889 above is strong in stock manipulation and company/train shenanigans, 1825U2 is a game where running strong companies works best. I enjoy this new (to me) aspect and hope to play this one with my game group some day.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
One of the most fun and accesible 18XX games, even if hard to find.

What makes it different from other economical games is how free-wheeling it is. You don't lose by overpricing a share for one dollar, you lose by your big decisions: Creating a new company, getting too many trains, building where you shouldn't...That's very unique and very fun.

1825 is short (2 hours) and very easy to play, as difficult as Automobile or Steam at worst, so you can play this game with practically anyone.

If you're only going to get one 1825 unit, then get this one. It scales well from 2-4 players, plays quickly (2.5-3 hours) and the board is tight enough, and the shares are issued quickly enough, to allow plenty of variety in the opening moves. The one thing you have to watch is the NER, this starts quite a long way from the action, so you don't really want to start it before the green tiles are available. This is very much a portfolio management game, so don't expect the brutality of the American 18xx's. This is about as short as an 18xx gets, but for all that it's better than many longer games in the series.
My rating: This Unit:8, Combined Units:10.

There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing. The strategies and tactics of this genre will forever remain opaque to me.

Unit 2 is the Midlands and a very tiny board. It's just the size of the game box while the other two are twice the size of the box. 

Pretty much the same game as Unit 1 but a different map can be combined with unit 1 and/or unit 3 for a larger longer game.

RATING: 6
Claustrophobic board that forces clever route planning.  I know next to nothing about the 18xx series, but it seems like the 1825 games emphasize route planning over stock market manipulation.  I enjoy the game but will need additional plays to really understand it.  It's kind of a catch-22, because to get additional play I need the play time to become shorter.  This seems like a good 2-player map.

Traded away.

Tremendous game.  Initially my reaction was that this is a tiny map.  But where Unit 1 had more space, the game felt very processional as the order of which companies could be floated was very strict.  In Unit 2, you have much more freedom (but not complete) about which companies to float.

The 2 minor companies did not add all that much to the game, but the extra 2000 we added to the bank did allow some of the later companies to flourish enough to become contenders.

1825 in all forms is a portfolio management game, and I find it a relief to not have to constantly be on guard to some of the dirty tricks employed in 1830.  I really like this game system, and will always be up to play more of it.

Plays great with 3 players.  Very tight and intense, the high cost of running trains over water and through mountains means that company management is much more difficult than in the south.  Probably a better game than Unit 1, but more difficult to play due to the low player requirements.

Excellent second part to the 1825 series. Different and much more claustrophobic to unit 1, although fewer expansions are available to it. Shines in combination with either unit 1 or unit 3, and is probably better as an unextended standalone than unit 1.

My favourite 18xx experience so far. Yes, the stock market is rather stale, but I don't mind - I think I actually prefer it.

Unit 2 has a tight map, there's not much room to maneuver. The game was very pleasant: three players (all new to 1825, all with some 18xx experience), three hours, lots of excitement. This unit also works quite well as a two-player game.

Â£6000 bank seemed like a right size for U2 + K5.

Suggest.

My first play of a true 18xx gMe was 1825 unit 2.
I was expecting something dry, mathsy and over long. What I found was a really interesting game with plenty going on even in other players turns. The game develops well and the maths part is not that intrusive. Incredibly well balanced with bank cash against the number of players.
I would happily play it again.

Slightly better than Unit 1 in my opinion. Focus is still on the operational side of 18xx. A nice game especially because it can accommodate fewer players and can be played in less time than most other 18xx titles allowing for strategic gaming under these constraints.

RATING: 10
The board is small, and the good cities are concentrated in the Liverpool/Manchester area. This makes for an exciting but relatively short game. I played this with 2 and 3, and both plays were excellent.

Compared to unit 3, the 2-player game seems more intense in this unit, with conflicts between companies almost from the start, whereas in unit 3, there is a little more room for the first few companies to go their separate ways.

As in the other 1825 units, the main emphasis is on running your companies as well as possible; companies end up with multiple trains. I like this better than the usual 18xx games, which revolve around stock trading manoeuvres.

RATING: 9
First 2-player game was very tight (7797/7791)! Five companies were in play and all but 1 6-train was puchased. Last 2 OR's had no track upgrades so the bank was just about perfect. Actually seemed a better 2-player than Unit 3.

RATING: 9
This is the best game for introducing new players into 18xx games.

I recommend this as the first game purchase out of the 1825 series.  After playing this Unit 2 a few times, you can then decide on which 1825 game or kit to buy next depending on your preferences. A recommended second purchase would be one of the following choices: (a) 1825 kit D1 &/or K5, (b) 1825 Unit 3, or (c) 1825 Unit 1.

Common plus points for 1825 Units 1, 2 or 3:
Each Unit on its own plays in a relatively short time compared with most 18xx games.
When a dividend is paid, the share price can rise by 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 spaces depending on the relative size of the dividend. A big plus over 1830.
No financial ruin by dumping a trainless company onto an unwilling new owner.  (People who want this feature in 18xx games should look elsewhere - e.g. 1830).

1825 Unit 2 also plays very well combined with 1825 Unit 3.  See both 1825 Unit 3 and 1 for further comments.

Other strongly recommended 18xx games are 1860 and 1861, but only if you want a much longer playing game.

RATING: 7
The upside:
-Very cool with a lower player count than most 18xx.
-The map is so tight that its almost cozy.

The downside:
-I doubt that you can see two very different games being played here, as in, it's very apparent where the companies should go and where to token.
-The share market dealings lack the dynamic/vitality that I most appreciate on the 1830 branch.

A fine small map 18xx, that's all about train operations and portfolio management. There's no stock market action at all, really.

With the provided tiles, this is a game of blocking and tempo management, but with the K1 tiles rolled in it's closer to something like Steam over Holland.

$6000 bank is about right, but maybe add another $500-$1000 if you want both the Unit 2 minors to fully come into play.

While I generally prefer the 1830 style of stockmarket cruelty, this is a really good flagbearer for the engineering style of game. The blocking and trackbuilding is really deep and intricate.

I started my investigation of the 18xx games as something of a skeptic.  While I don't think they are the greatest train games ever, I do think they are darn good.  I will note that these really feel more like economic games and not so much like train games -- to me.  However, I certainly agree with the draw these games have.  Since my preference is more toward the route building / planning aspect of the games and not stock manipulation, I sought out the 1825 series.  Despite the high prices I am happy with my purchase.  I do find that I want to play any chance I get, which really is not all that often.  That being said, I haven't played enough to really have a preference for Unit 1 or Unit 2 as a multiplayer game.  It did seem to me that Unit 2 is the better game for three players, but I really need some more games to form a more solidified opinion.  [02/08/2007]

As with Unit 1 the linear stock market makes for a more friendly stock game.  Again, this is for those that love the track building.  This map felt a little more forgiving, but you can still get hemmed in quickly.  It seems like this may be one of the best ways to jump into the 18xx pond.

01/27/08 - 2-player game went OK.  Board seemed a little constrained.  If memory serves, Unit 3 is the better 2 player game.  Would like to try 3 or 4, although if I can get 4, I'd probably rather play 1830 or have a go at 1856.

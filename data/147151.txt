The fact that anyone can walk into a room of people playing this game and immediately join in, figuring out the rules in about 30 seconds is the epitome of what a party game should be. The timing element makes it even more fun, not less, as brainstorming sets in. Completely awesome game.

RATING: 4
There are two ratings I want to give this; a 4 if I'm playing with random people at game night, and a 9 if I'm playing with my spouse and my parents. Both of my parents studied and taught conceptual education methodology at the collegiate level, so this becomes much more of an interesting activity with them (and I do largely define it as an activity over a "game" although if you come up with teams and use points, it could be a game). Most folks don't properly understand how concepts are defined, or how to use attributes (or additional descriptors) properly, and that makes this a really frustrating game once that clicks.

This game is the kind of game where the pieces belie many more uses than just game play.  We've never played it for points, more just to take turns.  It's like pictionary or charades, but all you do is place tokens on pictures on a board.  So it almost has a riddle-solving feel to it.

This game is not for everyone. You need players that can talk their way through solutions. If the "guessers" are not speaking, it makes it much for difficult for the concept givers. 

All that said, this was a good trade. It gets a lot of plays.

Tem um feeling de Imagem & Ação, mas depende mais mais quilometragem dos jogadores para ficar ágil. Funciona bem como jogo de festa. O sistema de pontuação descrito no manual é muito ruim, mas algumas adaptações com "regras da casa" resolvem o problema. 

Edição: Mesmo no nível mais difícil ele é bem fácil. Seria interessante usar as cartas de Imagem & Ação nele!

RATING: 8
The central idea in this party game is ingenious. The designers have inexplicable failed to include any sort of sensible scoring system. (The half-hearted partnership system described in the rulebook is lame.) The BGG variants section describes multiple ways to play and the game really improves as a result. It's beautiful to look at, and lots of fun to play. Brilliant.

The game resonates deeply with my inner nerd. Besides, I'm always looking for board games with non-standard dynamics, and this is one of my favorites. I can 
forget lunch, dinner, everything, while discussing with the Other Player about how to best use the subconcept-token. To be honest, I don't think we ever played it according to the actual rules, counting victory points really just distracts you from all the fun you have while playing. ..

It's okay. It's sort of a... Pictionary-like guessing game. But instead of drawing, it's all based on pointing to existing symbols. It's just not my type of game.

RATING: 9
recommended house rules: Forget all of the rules and the scoring.  Each player gets a card.  Go around the table taking turns (1 word/phrase at a time, so after the 9th time around the table the game is over).  Forget about the ! and ? pieces - use the squares to communicate concepts.  Different colors indicate a new thought (ex: use one color to indicate "milk", another to indicate "shake", then put them together for "milkshake").

This game is best played with EXTREMELY orthagonal thinking.  Can't get "Aristotle"?  Try old-old-old-old-historic-thinker (ancient philosopher) + country-of-olympics (Greece) + man-named ("female-inherits-lots-of-money" (heiress) + "baby" (tot)) (heiress + tot = Aristot[le]).

While I see how Concept is a well designed game, I don't find myself enjoying it particularly. 

I used this game mostly as a tool to teach English... and I was pretty successful in this regard with it. Every time I tried to play it as a game instead, I didn't find much inside the box for my enjoyment. Sure the idea is neat and the components - while simple - are nice looking, but the game-play is very repetitive and the interesting element that comes with the puzzle-like nature of the game gets old really fast.

Maybe, as I'm slowly discovering, I simply don't enjoy party games that much... and Concept is no exception. It's not a bad game by any means, if you're looking for a more "brain-teasery" kind of party game, but it just isn't a game for me.

I'm not convinced it's a party game I'd ever suggest over Codenames, but this is a pretty neat variation on the charades theme that spares the humiliation of having to stand up and remember the actions!

Second concept: (Red Cross, Flames)

I was interested in trying it, when someone offered at our meetup. Those who had played it before, though, weren't too keen on it and once we tried it, the reason become fairly clear. It's really rather hard to signal what you want in this game.

I noticed, watching Tabletop, that Rhett and Link could immediately guess what the other one was going for. But outside of them, and on the playthrough on Shut Up & Sit Down, everyone seemed to miss far more often than they hit. It seems like a game where, unless you know everyone at the table pretty well, and know how they think, it's going to result in a lot of blank stares and wrong guesses.

Possibly a great game for families. A horrible game for meetups and parties.

The concept of Concept is awesome. I like this game and I find it more difficult than expected.

RATING: 8.5
Not really a "game" per se but more like an "experience". Luckily then it's a really good one! I really grew to hate Pictionary and was never a fan of Charades to begin with and so this game (which is essentially a spiritual combination of the two) had some convincing to do. Suffice to say it was great and the options for choosing different clues at whatever difficulty suits the players best is a great thing. 

The downside would be that the scoring system is a little bit 'meh' but there are variants which aim to fix this. We ended up forgetting the scoring, like many others, and just had a blast taking it in turns.

An excellent light game with plenty of fun. I utterly despise Taboo – and Concept is slightly similar in that you spend almost 95% of the game frustrated while you ponder the crazy clues some lunatic has put out for you – but this game is so much more than that crappy old party game. It is innovative, looks clean and crisp and will be hilarious in our group with custom cards.
 
For the record, there are some people who this game is just not going to click for. If they're whiners, remove them from the planet as this is a harmless bit of infuriating fun. Our more boisterous group benefit from a ticking down timer and having a clockwise turn-taking mechanic for yes/no questions or making a guess. 

Update: Traded it for an old copy of Battlestations.

I like to describe this as "charades for shy people".  While this is often described as a "party game" it's more quiet and more thinky than your standard "Balderdash" or "Pictionary".  

Early rounds with new players are especially challenging as people will be unfamiliar with the myriad symbols on the board.  Once people get more familiar with the game, a sort of "language" will evolve that makes the game feel more satisfying.

A clever design that I hope to try more in the future.

When I first saw this game on the shelf (I work at a games store), I thought it looked dumb. I was so happy to be wrong! I played it at a friend's cabin, and we had a blast! We modified the rules a little, but overall, they stayed the same.

It's easy to play, easy to learn, and you get better at it as you play. I usually suck at explaining rules to groups, but this game is so simple. You could even design your own cards if you were so inclined.

A MUST for all game libraries! Seriously, drop what you are doing, go to your friendly, neighborhood games store and buy a copy. You won't regret it.

Very good family-party game, in the best sense.  A kind of evolution of Dixit, but more exciting in my opinion.  Active player must describe a "concept" (in a very wide sense) using the icons on the board.  At first it seems difficult, but as you get into it, you get new and fresh ideas about how to represent things.  There are three levels for the concept, the easiest one being maybe too easy.  Second level is quite ok, third level looks really terrific.
It is supposed to be played with teams, but I don't see the necessity.  It can perfectly be played individually.  Great fun.
Likely to be expanded with thematic cards...

Charades in the form of a board game. Solid party game, everyone always burst out laughing while playing this game and it creates lots of memorable moments. Caveat of the game is the official rules isn't really fun but the variant really up the game to a solid 8. Some of the words provided are more catered to the Western audiences as well. Quite steep the pricing for this game as well, got it for second-hand and hence worth every penny.

Interesting thinky, party style game. I have an alternate scoring method that works MUCH better than what is included in the box. We had fun with this one. My one drawback, and it's a pretty big one, is that when a player is shouting out possible answers, another player can jump onto that and steal the points. In our game, Brian was trying to get us to guess "crossword puzzle". Brett guessed "crossword". I then said the correct answer, giving Brian and I the points. I can see how this is detrimental to the fun of the game. I am thinking next time, you only give clues to one player, determined randomly each round. If that works as good as I think it should, my rating will increase.

Concept is a light, but thinky party game that is a great filler for longer game nights but is also ideal to  break out when time is limited.

Imagine Pictionary with the player trying to have a word guessed through the use of symbols and iconography as opposed to drawings; this is the crux of Concept. The game is indeed a neat twist on the "guess this" genre, and it is accessible for all players and ages. The problem with Pictionary is that a certain ability to communicate ideas through pen and paper is needed, something that isn't innate to everyone; however, Concept already displays the drawings on the game board, and you simply have to connect the different symbols to make "concepts" apparent to the other players.

For example, if you want to illustrate the word "wine", you would simply place the green question-mark token on the symbol that shows food/beverage (the main "concept"); you would then place green cubes that would further develop the "concept" on the liquid symbol and on the colour red. The other plays might think of wine, but they could also think of tomato juice for example. You could then add an exclamation-mark token of a different colour on the symbol for festivities. The use of other colours allow you to illustrate "sub-concepts" that strengthen the main concept.

My various game groups have tried counting points and simply playing for fun. Either works, but I believe the success of the session will depend on how competitive your game group is.

My biggest complaint for the game is that if you are not careful, the other players might start asking verbal questions to guess the concept, and the game divulges into a session of 20 questions. Some of my gaming group believes that asking questions is fine; however, I believe that too many questions detracts from the game's essence. Additionally, you may come to a point where no one or very few people have actually heard of the concept (I say this because there are a lot of different words, from pop culture to Greek mythology). This is something to keep in mind. 

Overall, Concept is a game that stays true to the title. You are simply making others guess concepts. It hardly has much "game" behind it, but it is still a great social board game that has you racking your brain for that person, place, or thing you simply can't recall. Concept receives a recommendation from me, but, in my opinion it is not a game that is easily adored, or hated for that matter. it is simply a solid party game.

Concept is a very challenging party game: it’s the thinking non-gamer’s game, as it requires the ability both to abstract concepts and to lay them out in a way that makes sense.

Although I like its...concept I also find it pretty frustrating to play as most items to guess in the cards are pop-culture oriented, a field I’m not too familiar with.

Whether playing it is a blast or a let-down really depends on the group: it tends towards the fun side though.

Feels more like a concept for a game.

A very awesome game whose only flaw is that it is lacking a companion app which generates cards from some online place where they can continuously expand the number of words.

We ofc can fix that ourselves, but with the given card set the game can only be replayed a finite number of times. But other than that, it is absolutely amazing.

Usable for any group, easy to teach, everyone can readily laugh about it.

'Charades the board game', more or less, though with a bit of a twist and it's well done and good fun. Hard to see how to do most of the harder clues but I guess you build up a vocabulary with some experience, which might make it possible - though it looks like quite a leap from a beginner's perspective.

RATING: 7
A good party game should reward creativity, which this does.  It also strips out the performance aspect that similar "guess what I'm thinking" party games have.  It's also a good sign for a party game when the group stops keeping track of the game and just enjoys the party aspect, as my group did.  A good party game is a collaborative toy first and a game second, which Concept does admirably well.  If you are creative but shy, this is your kind of party game.  However, the learning curve is kinda steep as party games go, and it's hard to just pick up and learn.  New players need a few examples to understand how Concept works.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I really enjoyed this game the first time out, but it's hold on me waned pretty quickly.

Firstly, and just a personal thing, like all these games it relies too much on pop culture for it to be that much fun for me. This is a game that really didn't need to go to that well at all to work, but there are still enough pop culture references that I end up just having to check out for. It would be fine (for me anyway) if the game balanced that with some more "high" cultural things I do know a bit about (classical music, literature, art) but there is only a small literary element - mostly folklore - and not much else. Fine, but it makes it hard for me to enjoy the game much, and - the sad thing - it's a game that could very easily have been made in a way that I would have more thoroughly enjoyed. An additional way that this becomes somewhat problematic for this game is that players can easily pick clues for cultural references that they know they share with one of the the other players.

More problematic, I think, are the communication rules that are needed for the game to work properly but almost impossible to adhere to or enforce. The rules allow the "describing" team to use the board and to say "yes", and that's it - no other communication is allowed, between either the team members or with the other players. But inevitably (in my experience), the describing players end up pushing the envelope and pantomiming or signaling to each other in a way that messes with the way the game is intended to work, is not ideal given the design is what it is, and can be unfair.

In general, the game feels underdeveloped. It could have used more clarity on workable set of communication rules, and more explanation of the design intent so that players understand how much non-game-board-related-communication is acceptable (because some is inevitable), and why it's important. I realize it's supposed to be a fun party-type game, but understanding the full intent of the design is often key to enjoying a game for what it is.

Another development area would be the difficulty levels of the clues, which seemed almost seem random. There may be a language/cultural thing going on there though. There are also many that are simply too hard to describe with the concepts available on the board, and so devolve to simply guessing a lot and hoping. 

I still think it's a decent game. But it's a great core idea that could have been an actually great game, if it had been pushed a little harder to be all that it could be.

Charades for introverts. The base mechanic is fantastic. The specific rules for team play don't work well. I've had good success using a cooperative  scoring system with both my family and my gaming. Similar to the one Wil Wheaton used on Tabletop.

Basically charades using only pictures as clues.  It's really fun figuring out how to get across some fairly complex clues using only the provided pictures, and the system for relaying various "concepts" is clever.

Overall, just a good, casual game.  I'd rather just play without scoring, and just have fun giving clues and guessing other peoples' clues just to see how clever everyone can be.

This feels like "charades with a board game." I like it as a party game, but it seems to be limited by the number of players that can find around a table (and see the board). It also might require people to have their glasses on to see the board from a distance.

It's a novel concept, though (no pun intended).

This is probably the best new party game to come around in years. I have a friend who is LOVES party games nearly to the exclusion of all other genres, and we played it together and I am very happy to report that when he wants to play this one repeatedly, I don't foresee myself tiring of it. Sure, you'll run out of topics sooner rather than later, but it's pretty trivial to make your own or steal some from another game.

Fans of Time's Up will really dig this, I think. It has the same shared laughter at other people's obscure clues and foreign lines of thinking. And oh my god does it feel good when you've all been staring at something for ten minutes feeling like you'll never get it with the cluegivers gesturing wildly at you and making encouraging noises and then you FINALLY remember an incredibly simple and common phrase that's been in the periphery of your mind since the very start and feel simultaneously like the world's biggest idiot and world's biggest genius. It is simply glorious.

Not that this is a game where points matter (even my otherwise extra-competitive boyfriend who even tries to play Cards Against Humanity competitively didn't care to keep score, for once) but the 1-point tokens feel totally useless if you're playing with an even number of players. We ignore them in this instance, and just give someone an extra point if they have to bring in a third party or give 1 point each for ties.

Though tracking the double point markers IS a very effective turn limit. It makes the game length just right, in my opinion. After running out, we usually just throw the tokens back in the center, switch up the teams, and start again!

Update: Once you are familiar with the game, there's not much reason to keep playing in teams. But always, always play in teams when introducing new players to the system - it really helps to have two sets of eyes on the board/cheat sheet when you're new, as there's an overwhelming amount of spaces to memorize. It also just takes a few turns to really come up with good ways to give clues - when and how to use sub-concepts, etc.

The Concept (haha! Get it?!) of this game is awesome! It’s actually not much of a game, it’s more like an activity for creative minds. In Concept you try to explain a, well, concept, to the other players but without saying words. The way you do it is that you have a board in front of you with various spaces representing e.g. a man/woman, buildings, night, phrase, the colors, high/tall, food, animal etc. etc. etc. You then place a question mark on one of those spaces, which then represents the word the players are trying to guess. An easy word could be milk; you place it on the food, and then put cubes on liquid and the color white. It starts getting very interesting once you need to guess a phrase, for instance “a needle in a haystack” (which was one of the actual phrases). 

There are tons of different words with various difficulties. We have never NOT guessed a word, but it has been a close call a couple of times, and we only guessed it after 10 minutes with 5 players guessing… Because we just wanted to solve the puzzle! Normally you score points in the game for solving the words, but the rules actually state that you should probably just play without keeping scores, and I agree with that. It’s the same we do in Telestration; a game which gets much, much better if you just play for fun without scoring!

Concept is such a great party game and has been a big hit with everybody I’ve introduced it to (though the groups have so far only been non-gamers, light gamers and family; no hardcore gamers). It’s such an enjoyable game, and it’s awesome to see how different people express themselves in different ways. Even my mother and sister, who aren’t fans of games, like this game a lot, and they’re very good at it too.

This game is great for a slower, thoughtful night with a couple friends. It bills itself as a party game, and shares elements with pictionary/charades/taboo, but it feels nothing like those games. However, we don't play with points (the designers say in the rulebook  that that's how they play), so I imagine it'd be more energetic doing easier concepts and trying to guess first for points.

What a clever little party game. Throw out the rules that come in the box, they're terrible. Instead, everyone gets a card full of concepts. Choose one. Depending on the difficulty of what they've chosen, they either get 3, 4, or 5 minutes to try to express what's on the card. If someone guesses correctly, they get 1 point and the initial player gets 2. 

This sort of floored me. I'm not usually into family style party games, but the creativity and imagination that Concept encourages and allows is pretty stellar. The rules are stupidly simple (really, I just gave you everything in the paragraph above) but the concepts can get deceptively difficult to get across. How do you convey the concept of "regret" using combinations of simple pictures? Or "nothing"?

The game is more of an exercise in how good at non-verbal communication you are, so people who aren't very expressive might not get much out of this. And really, you're playing into people's minds more than the board: are the people you're playing with familiar with what you're trying to get across? What would be a good initial sequence of pictures to pick from that will lead people into thinking what you want them to think? It reminds me a bit of Dixit in this way. So simple, but so good.

It doesn't hurt that the graphic design for the box and components is refreshingly clean and modern.

A great idea for a game that can be played at a lot of levels making it suitable for a range of ages. Unfortunately the scoring rules are about the dumbest I've seen (even for a party game). Heck, the designers admit in the rules to not actually using them. But getting rid of the teams, adding a bit of time pressure, and the incentive of points for the clue giver can make it a good, fun, competitive game.

More an activity than a game, but an interesting idea where players must get their clues across by placing indicators on relatively abstract/generalized icons on the board.  Once you get the hang of it, it can be quite fun!  I don't know that we'd pull this out often, but the whole idea of the game feels quite novel at the moment.

Fun as an activity, less so as a game. The scoring mechanic is rather clumsy, rewarding non-stop shouting over a more thoughful approach. Formulating the concepts is the highlight of this game, though I've seen some players having a difficult time grasping the rather structured way this game requires you to think about your hints. The German-language cards feature a strange mixture of obscure and old-fashioned phrases and current trash-tv celebrities in the higher difficulties, which did not go over well with my group.

Innovative game that is different enough from other word/phrase guessing games to occupy a niche of its own.
My rating of 6 is for the variant the designers/publisher/editor seem to recommend, which abandons the points system. I think the rules for the points are outright stupid and don't fit the game at all. If I were forced to play it with this points system, I'd rate that version considerably worse.

Deberia revisar las demás microreseñas porque fijo que me estoy empezando a contradecir a mi mismo, pero justo cuando escribo esto, considero el Concept como el party game definitivo. El Time's Up es una pasada, pero o conoces la palabra o tienes que dar muchas vueltas para llegar. Aquí, la palabra suele ser conocida por todos, pero tienes que dar vueltas a cómo demonios la describes con los dibujitos de la mesa. Una pasada, de verdad. Y cuando se acaben las cartas, te inventas tu tus propias definiciones (al momento si hace falta, usando pelis que acabas de ver o objetos que están en tu misma sala), este juego rejugabilidad infinita sí que la tiene de verdad.

Components: Solid components; fun images. As with other games that put multiple words/clues on a single card, it's difficult to manage the deck of used vs. unused cards.

Experience: Really, really tough. I like having to think of clusters of clues, but some of the images are so ambiguous, and some of the words are so tough. A real head-scratcher.

Having a partner really helps to keep the clue-giving from stagnating.

Firstly, I love the idea and execution of the game. The icons limit you so you have to be creative no matter what and every player provides a unique insight into their thoughts. I think this game could be bad if you play with people who don't understand social cues or take forever thinking instead of acting, but that could be mitigated with a timer or limiting the number of guesses.

This isn't a game. Like legitimately, there's not a game in the rules here. The whole point mechanism makes no sense and is pointless.

Concept is basically just a variant on charades without any clear structure or rules to it. As an "activity" in the right group at the right mood, it can be very fun. But as a "game", it fails regardless.

The strength of this game is in the clues. Other than celebrity names, you will very rarely encounter a clue where you read it and go "I just don't know what that is", and a lot of them give you multiple ways around - with the word "wolverine" do you describe the animal or the X-man? Up to you!

The official scoring rules are weird and I don't understand them though. I just give a point for a correct guess and a point if someone guesses it with a vague time limit.

Players take turns selecting a clue off a card, and trying to get the concept of that clue over to the other players.  This is done by placing nice plastic pieces out onto a clue board consisting of about a hundred icons.  Players can quickly grasp that the clue is a person, movie, book, food, whatever.  Further clues and sub-concepts can be used to refine the procedure.

Fantastic activity - I hesitate to call this a game (the scoring system is suspect, and even the designers attempt to distance themselves from it in the rules) - that has been a huge hit with three different groups I've introduced this too.  It's quite amazing how quickly people take to it, then start exploring the game space it provides.  

A copy of this should belong in every game collection.

Probably about 20 games in and I think we're getting too good at it.  Rating drops a point to an 8.

Don't get all the hype and the Spiel des Jahres nomination this received. I found it really boring and uninspiring. The fact that it uses pre-designed icongraphics to convey the informations hinders the imagination and creativity, in my opinion.
Also, it feels like this wants to be a party game, like Taboo or Pix, but it fails in delivering the laughs and cheerful atmosphere. Instead, everyone is sincerely looking at the board and making guesses.
Maybe just played it with the wrong group, though.

Concept is probably my favorite game in the limited-information-transmission genre of party games. Limited-communication games rest primarily on the cleverness of the limitations on communication, and Concept's limitation is a doozy: the cluegiver may only inform the guessers by way of cubes and icons placed on a grid of central symbols.

It's these symbols that make the game; they range from obvious variations of colors and materials to bizarre two-and-three-dimensional shapes to more abstract concepts. The clues are nicely structured to force the occasional mental restructuring. (For example, "circle of friends" required a detour to the TV show, and "Porky Pig" required us to figure out what exactly fragments from a mouth meant.) You can also do neat things with numbers of cubes or shapes to emphasize styles or point out something new.

This cleverness causes the game to create a feeling of real openness; you can go with the obvious symbols, or go with a pop-culture or literary reference out of left field. There's also the occasional bits of amusement caused by misidentification, where somebody (me) misremembers Venus as having no head instead of no arms. It's everything I'm looking for in a limited-communication party game, and I don't see it getting old soon.

No real need to bother with the scoring mechanism; the game isn't the sort where that really matters. If you're sufficiently competitive about party games to cause this to bother you, I'd recommend looking for something else.

Just set this game up on a table, step away, and watch people gravitate to it and after a few minutes you’ll soon see a crowd of players shouting and cheering along.  More of a ‘fun activity’ than a game, the actual rules regarding points and game play are pretty malleable.  It can be played individually or as a team sport.  I haven’t played it enough yet to find a “best way” to play it (although I have added a sand-timer to put a some control on it), but players just seem to enjoy simply going at it trying to express their ‘concept’ to the other players; that is where the real fun is.  Contrary to Codenames, where I know many people seem to dread taking their stressful turn as the Spymaster/clue-giver, in Concept, players seem to jostle over WANTING to take their turns to be the one expressing their concept.   

A fantastic party game, but I do wonder about its re-playability given the initial limited number of cards in the box: I hope they have some more expansion decks coming (similar to the way new Dixit expansion cards are produced every so often).

Outstanding family/party game. It's great for everyone - kids to grandparents. Lots of laughs, with a dose of occasional frustration. We like to play where the presenter selects an easy, medium, or difficult concept and gets 1,2, or 3 minutes to present, respectively. If they are successful, they and the correct guesser get 1, 2, or 3 light bulbs, respectively. 

It's fun, but can get very frustrating due to limited pictures.

2017-12-30 : Another play with the following house-rules :
- Everyone always has a card in hand so they can think ahead of their turn
- On their turn they pick a 1,2 or 3 point concept and have 3 minutes (timer) to get it across.
- If somebody guesses their word correctly the active player and the guesser score the points.
- If all points are gone, most points wins

Concept is an interesting idea of a game where you are trying to relay your concept through various iconography. Most consider the rules that come with the game to be pretty terrible and other consider this to be more of an activity than a game (i.e. Telestrations). I find being an activity to be more acceptable in Telestrations than this, because Telestrations is hilarious. I think this could be a good game with a solid set of rules, but I'm not willing to put in the effort to come up with some. It would be like being sold Dixit cards and finding out I have to create my own rule set. Since I wouldn't do this, I could at least derive joy from a set of dixit cards due to its wonderful artwork, unlike Concept.

This game is a board-based version of Charades where you leave clues for the other players to work out the answer to. I love how this has simple rules (making it easy to introduce to non-gamers) and there are emergent strategies in how you leave and interpret the clues.

Feels like a party game for academics. Which I am. But still...

It's not very intuitive because you're limited to the symbols they provide and you have to familiarize yourself with them first. Also hard to rate because this is more an activity than a game. It can easily be made into a game, but I think you need to have played it for some time before that. Adding time pressure would most likely result in a frustrating experience.

Each difficulty worked out quite well either way and it's an interesting experience every time. Even some of the more obscure phrases and things seemed to work out if you can find some clever ways to break down the words. Loved it!

Concept is an interesting concept (teehee :)) but there is not all that much game here as the rules are very very vague and can (and did in our play) lead to a lot of rules discussion and arguement. 

You draw a card with an object/phase/person etc on it and then you have to convey that concept by adding coloured cubes to the board, for example 

The question mark on male indicated the correct answer is a man.
A cube of the same colour on a image of a video camera could suggest you are looking for an actor.

An exclamation mark of another colour indicates a sub-concept something related to the answer but not part of the answer something to help you narrow it down. 

For example an exclamation on an image of a boat or ship,  the same coloured cube on a down arrow and multiple coloured cubes on a skull and cross bones. 
Ship > down (sink) > lots of death...... Titanic

therefore we are looking for an male actor related to titanic.... Leonardo DiCaprio.

It feels like this game would work with a large group of people that play together very regularly and that understand the way each other can think.

Essentially a more calm version of charades, with symbols on a board instead of gestures.   Both a party and a thinking game.   When I play, I always have more fun than I expect to have, but not as much fun as some other party games, like Codenames or Cards Against Humanity.

Very good game! In my opinion, one of the best "family" a little behind Dixit and Codenames! Note: the game requires a creative and extroverted group !! A weak group in these areas will make the experience with the game be middle or bad ... *** Best with 6 players ***

Summary: More activity than game, but one of the better party "games" I've ever played as players try to communicate through a few simple icons. [b]Will buy[/b]

Rating history:
1st play: :star::star::star::star::nostar:
4th play: :star::star::star::nostar::nostar:

1st play: DEC/14. Less of a game than I expected, but I don't care: this "game" was a blast to play. It sounds so simple - almost too simple. Use cubes to mark certain icons on a board and hope other players can guess the "concept" you were given. Zucchini: plant / food / green - people will get is fairly quickly. Moses? Person / ancient / religious. But how about something like "ask for a hand" or "cat got your tongue"? Yeah, this game is one I'd love to play fairly often. I will be buying a copy in my next order.

4th play: DEC/14. Still enjoy this game, but the shine has come off a bit, and I don't think I will buy it (I'm content to borrow my friend's copy once in a while.) One of the best party games, but still a party game, which has limited interest to me.

Nem biztos, hogy igazságos leszek vele, mert csak pár kört toltunk 3-4-en, józanon. Ilyen körülmények között nekem elmaradt az élmény az Activityhez és a Dixithez képest. Fő problémám, hogy nem sok mindent tud csinálni a magyarázó játékos a kitalálási folyamat alatt. Kitesz gyorsan 3-4 jelölőt, és a többiek találgatnak. De innentől nem igazán tud tovább segíteni, ha nem megy a dolog, mert a többi rajz, annyira nem nem igazodik a feladványhoz, hogy csak félrevezeti őket, ha elkezd variálni.

Concept is really difficult to rate. As a concept the game works fine and is actually a lot of fun to fool around with with the right group. As a game, however, it largely falls flat. The real fun is in tackling the harder terms and seeing whether you can bring them across.

As an activity this would easily score a 7. As a game I'd rather not play.

If you enjoy Alias, but would like to challenge yourself to explain words with pictures, then this game is made for you.

You're gonna have awesome times when someone guesses the word in 2 pictures and sometimes when you've poured all the cubes onto the board and just want to rip out your head, because no one understands your thought process.

But it is guaranteed to give that party night some nice energy, especially if nooo one understands the one who's explaining.

After one play, which we extended to something like four hours. A charades variant, which can be exciting/thrilling but can also be a dud at times, depending on the word/phrase chosen and the people you're playing with. We had a great time with it, but even then there were some words where we just guessed wildly and quickly gave up.

The concepts provided are limited, of course, so you have to stretch your imagination. I do like how it makes you think differently about something. Would happily pull it out and play it again.

Update: Never did get to pull it out again, and ended up selling it. I think in the end we were more interested in other party games for bigger groups.

This game requires the right group. If someone isn't into the game, their turns can be excruciating, and trying to get them to guess clues can be frustrating. We always play this as a group instead of in teams, and I enjoy the way it gets my kids thinking abstractly as they put clues together.

Bought in April 2014. Kind of a semiotic [thing=2281][/thing].

Last time we played with a 5-minute timer and the game was much pacier. Also, we allowed the clue-giver to choose any of the 9 items on the card - if s/he chose an "easy" the clue-giver and the correct answer would each score 1 point, 2 points each for a "medium" and 3 each for a "hard". Worked well. We're a bit more tuned into the thinking now, and we were doing the difficult ones quite successfully.

I sometimes bring this to the monthly gaming meet-up I organise, to help justify keeping it on my shelves, but the whole game is basically just a clever gimmick. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy it, but more as an activity than a game

OK, it's basically Charades: the Board Game, but it also manages not to be naff, unlike Charades. Good as an educational tool as well as a game. We just play without points, and allow the clue-givers to pick from the cards, or make up their own subjects. Good as a filler, or party game.

Concept is quickly becoming a staple of my game group as a filler. Everyone wants a turn. Everyone wants to participate. And it's very easy to integrate people into the game as they show up.

This one is a brain bender. I think it's best played cooperatively as it can be monumentally frustrating when it gets competitive. It's essentially charades but with icons. While this sounds simple, the limited options mean you have to think flexibly and your interpretations may differ greatly from your teammates. My favorite thing about Concept is that it gives a fascinating insight into how each player thinks and connects ideas. It can be really entertaining to have the guessers get incredibly close but yet be completely off. Best example I've had: trying to get them to guess "booger" while they list just about every medical term related to mucus and you struggle to show them that it's childish slang without leading them away from what they've already figured out.

This was enjoyable, but surprisingly easy. Only the top difficulty words presented any challenge. Since there is no time constraint, all answers were eventually figured out.

Charades with icons instead of gestures. Most of the people I know don't keep score, but simply play for a bit for fun.  With experienced players, you could form teams, employ a timer and make a game of it, or play the way the rules state (All players at the table take turns providing clues in groups of two with the first person guessing the answer and them scoring points; With no timer and the clue givers always getting points, it comes down to who at the table guesses the most answers).

This is just a ridiculously difficult game. It is so much fun with a group of good friends and its so satisfactory when people guess it correctly, but the rules are kind of vague to me and it can be frustrating, but what makes it frustrating at times is also what makes it so great. Everyone thinks differently so you really need to connect with your friends on this one.

My left-brained self simply cannot get around the lack of structure. Although it can be a compelling exercise in intuition, most of the time it just freaking drags (considering the mental processing required for each turn), and right-brained individuals will completely drown you out with questions while you are busy analyzing connections. Some clues are either poorly-written, a pop-culture reference you might not get, or esoteric. There need to be at least a dozen more icons. I far from hate this game, but I would not cry if I never played it again.

RATING: 5
A nice quiz game through abstract deduction. The game, Concept, is mainly based on partnership mechanic to find out correct answer. Game questions in Concept are guided by several illustrations. Participants make a correct answer by using their intuition and deduction power. The game is very fun and full of warm and nice communication. However, the game regulation is somewhat easygoing and vulnerable. Especially, there is no certain answering order to participants, so that all kinds of rough guess and answers are flooded throughout the game. Sometime, these kinds of situations drive the game to big disorder. For this reason, I still prefer Dixit much. Without this looseness of game regulation, Concept is quite a good family game. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves plentiful communication.

I have heard people say this is less of a game and more an activity, and I agree with that, but this doesn't take anything away from it as it's good fun and the points are totally meaningless - everyone can just laugh and enjoy the experience.

I love how the game pieces provide a sandpit for the players to play in, the coloured pieces can be used imaginatively with the pictures on the board and I think this is the main attraction.  I think that some of the cards that come with the game had some pretty stupid words and phrases on them, and I think that this game would also be great with the players coming up with their own.

I played Concept with two very different groups, and it didn't wow me in either attempt. The second session was better because it was with word gamers vs. hardcore board-gamers, but it still wasn't lively enough to make me want to play it again. The idea is an interesting one, and there's some joy to be had when someone finally guesses a hard phrase. But it leaves no lasting impression with me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
Unique game where one player trys to get others to guess a word or phrase by putting coloured emphasis cubes on combinations of symbols. With practice there are enough different symbols on the board to represent almost anything you can think of, the key is what combination of symbols is best used to get the idea across in the quickest time. Can be played as a game in rotating pairs of clue givers and phrase guessers, the only downside to the game is that it is difficult for a pair of players to talk about what symbols they think would work as clues without the rest of the players hearing them strategize. The game might work best with each player acting alone as the clue giver and all others guessing. Concept is a great game that can work well with a large group. Less of a game ... but a great activity.

RATING: 7
Party game which tries to use the same basic mechanic of pictionary or tabu but taking it to another different level. Instead of painting or saying words or whatever, all the symbols are plotted on the board and you have to indicate whatever you are trying to make the others players guess (movies, concepts, things, person, animal...) with color cubes and other signals. 
The game comes with many cards with concepts to be guessed, from difficulty 1 to 9, but, as the designers tell in the instructions, it is fun just to make up your own movies, songs... Highly recommended for groups of non-gamers, for gamers as well, but I find easier to catch the attention of those non used to play board games.
Positive:
1. Easy to explain
2. Easy to play
3. Recommended for every type of player
Negative:
1. For unexperienced players, it may be difficult to understand what is going on if you start playing with some complicate concepts
2. There are some images that may be difficult to understand or that can be understood differently from one person to another, you have lists with a short description were the players can check the concept, but it may slow down a bit the game. At least at the beginning

I'm not completely sure that this is strictly speaking a game, but it's a fun thing to do, especially in large casual group settings.

Update: this keeps coming back to the table, and I keep wanting it to, so I've added a point to its score. A couple of notes, it definitely shouldn't be played for points. I suspect I'll never use my lightbulbs. Also, it can be a lot of fun once you've gone through and seen a lot of the cards to start making up your own things to clue. And cluing words in creative, offbeat ways is a fun way to spice up the game.

I need a new deck of cards, we've been through the deck 3 or 4 times now.
We play non-competitively, no points, no teams. We also started rolling a d10 to pick our word for us. On a 0, if we don't know what the word is, or the word is boring, re-roll. We want to keep it interesting, so better words == more fun.

I bought this game(ish) after listening to a review of it on the Secret Cabal? I think.  My wife and friends love it.  

First of all, it is pretty.  The design of the board and the icons were ingeniously put together. 

The only (sort of) con about this game is the scoring.  The scoring in the game is odd.  

That said, every time we have played this game we've given up on the scoring altogether and just played to play and still had a blast.  

This is a great creative party-style game (or activity) that appeals to gamers and non-gamers alike. I would definitely recommend

I'm not clear on how scoring is supposed to work.  The TableTop episode that featured this game used custom scoring, and when we played we just played for a while and only vaguely kept score.  So at this point, I'm not sure there's actually a game there or not.  It's moderately entertaining as just an activity, but I'm not sure it has staying power. Update: the second time I played this, the group I joined was just playing it as a cooperative activity and not actually scoring. It's okay, but it can get frustrating if you get stuck and there's seemingly no way to get out.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (May 2014)

WOW, what a surprise game! Some friends warned me that Concept wasn’t a game, more an activity for communicators not engineers, so most likely I wasn’t going to like it. I’m glad they were very wrong. 

I really love Concept AND it is a competitive game. I haven’t read the rules, but the game was explained to me without partnerships. After I read the rules I will come back and comment on them, not sure if we played an official variant or not. So far I love the game; it is a unique game in my collection and a great party game. 

Concept has great components and can be explained in less than 1 minute. It can be very hard to correctly convey the concept in the card (a plus for me). I think Concept has infinite replayability as you can use you own concepts.

I (somewhat) dislike that players shout their answers, for example, when it is clear that the answer is a rock band all players begin screaming bands so it is mostly luck of a player catch the correct answer first than the others, perhaps we can solve this if players take turns to answer, but this is a very minor dislike.  
I don’t think I will ever get rid of it. Great game. It has the potential to go up even higher in my personal ratings.

It's funny.  I don't know if this is really a game.  I mean, it's certainly an enjoyable activity but, it's almost as if there are no rules.  Even the rules say that it's up to the players to come up with their own rules.  It seems like a good basis for a game but, I wouldn't say its completely fleshed out.  Now, that being said, there's a lot of fun here.  I'd like to see a timer added and players can certainly add their own.  Also, it seems like the "easy" clues are actually rather difficult to figure out while the "hard" clues are simple.  Your mileage may vary.

It's much better to play this than charades (where you make a fool of yourself) or pictionary (where you embarrass yourself). Groups are more willing to play it for those two reasons.

It's a fun game, but it's a bit broken. The board and way the concepts work are well thought out, but it feels like it's lacking just a little bit, like perhaps gestures, actions, a few more describers, etc.

The cards are not balanced at all. Some expressions and titles we never heard of, and at times the 'easy' would be far too difficult, and vise-versa. For example, one of the 'challenging' (hardest) words was black eye. The person who got it put a token on eye, and the color black... yeah, not that hard.

Then comes the rules. It's very vague how to rules work, but we figured they're trying to describe the classic pictionary team rules. However we don't like playing in teams as you're limited by the person you're teamed up with. So we just had everyone guess, and gave points to the one who guessed it and the one who gave the concept. It even said in the rule book that after testing it, they found it more fun to just guess and not do teams or points. They couldn't have at least figured out a better system!? I think there are some good variants in the variant forums for this game.

So it's a well designed board (that could use just a bit more), the concepts are okay if not a bit scattered, but the rules are poorly designed (they felt like an after thought). It feels like this game should have sat a bit more in the slow cooker... Maybe future versions will be better.

After looking forward to the design, I was definitely disappointed. I should have looked more carefully at the rules and seen that even the people behind the game admit (as in Telestrations), that they often play more as an activity than a game. This seems like something that could easily be made competitive with the right rules, perhaps with dueling boards, to make it like Word Blur. But as it is now, it is an interesting exercise, definitely frustrating at times (but I think it's made to be), but simply not fun enough to be played a lot. 

In almost all respects I think I prefer the Pictionary Card Game, which does this in a competitive and more exciting way.

People seem to like this one more than I did.  Feels like charades with a board.  Maybe Pictionary without drawing is a better description.  Hard to describe without showing it, I guess.  heh  It is somewhat fun as an exercise, but is barely a real game.

Excellent game that has only one weak point - limited vocabulary. During one weekend  in nice company we went over all pack of cards two or three times and already begun to guess correctly not because of good explanation, but because it was explained in a similar way before. As soon as they start releasing additional word packs for it, I'll change my rating to 10.

Csak egy megcsavart Barkochba. Biztosan van, akinek ez nagyon fekszik, de szerintem feleslegesen bonyolított ezzel a rengeteg ikonnal. Ha nem muszáj, többet nem játszom vele, mert most már többször adtam neki esélyt, de egyszer sem sült el jól.

Wanted to grab this fun party game (more of an activity) before the Wheaton effect. Was a hit the first time we brought it out and we didn't even bother keeping score. A lot of the concepts are hard to get across, but I suppose that's the challenge to the "game". Love the high player count (the box says 4-12+) and looking forward to many, many more plays.

It's sort of a mash up of Charadess and Pictionary only with a grid of symbols and icons. It's great for people that would be too self-conscious to play real charades. I love racking my brain for different and creative ways to convey what's on the card using the board in front of me. It really makes you feel accomplished when you pull it off! The scoring system is loose and could have used some work before release though. Apparantly nobody follows it anyways.

Use images to get your concept across! This game is fun if you're in the mood to think it out with friends or if you're a competitive thinker. 

One thing I have noticed is it gets very old, very fast. I think everyone has their one way of thinking when trying to get a concept across and since you're limited to the board, you can't do much more than that.

Maybe with more plays at cons or something I'll like it more.  Well, "liking" it isn't the issue, it's that I don't think anyone in my group would ever want to play it, perhaps myself included.  7 for now because it's not "bad", just very "situational".

RATING: 7
This game is much more fun that it would appear to be.  We had an absolute blast playing it with non-gamers, who got it immediately.  People didn't want to leave the table.  You need to house rule it, and as some critics have pointed out, it's more of an activity than a game.  We did not score it after the first couple of tries, didn't seem to be a need to.  Definitely need a time limit of five minutes or less.  Can play individually, although getting help can be critical in expressing something differently.  Two player is also fine.  Great game.  Edit after quite a number of plays now:  rarely play with teams; competitive people really want to score it; planning on house ruling you can't start yelling out guesses before someone has put down at least two clues.  It really gets annoying to me when people start shouting out answers and the person has barely begun.

Now this is interesting - really made me waiting for the finnish edition (updated 3/2015: bought it). After couple of first games you realize, that this game is missing the right rules to count points. But okay, that's easy part to solve (you'll find couple of examples here at BGG). Otherwise Concept is a well made game and I see a lot of places where Concept is a good choice to be played. This would deserve 8, but because they f*cked up the difficulty levels when they translated Concept to Finnish, it gets only 7. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
In Concept, your goal is to guess words through the association of icons. A team of two players – neighbors at the table – choose a word or phrase that the other players need to guess. Acting together, this team places pieces judiciously on the available icons on the game board.

To get others to guess "milk", for example, the team might place the question mark icon (which signifies the main concept) on the liquid icon, then cubes of this color on the icons for "food/drink" and "white". For a more complicated concept, such as "Leonardo DiCaprio", the team can use the main concept and its matching cubes to clue players into the hidden phrase being an actor or director, while then using sub-concept icons and their matching cubes to gives clues to particular movies in which DiCaprio starred, such as Titanic or Inception.

Bei Concept stehen Begriffe auf Karten, die von Teams nacheinander gezogen und erkärt werden müssen. Das Spielfeld ist eine Abbildung zahlreicher Piktogramme, die vielfältig zu interpretierende Charakteristika abbilden. Anhand dieser Bilder versuchen wir mit kleinen Steinchen den gesuchten Begriff sinnvoll zu umschreiben, damit die anderen Teams ihn erraten können. Bei erfolgreicher Erläuterung bekommen sowohl das Team, das erkärt, als auch das Team, das das gesuchte Wort erraten hat, Punkte. 
Wird der Begriff mit wenigen Hinweisen nicht erraten, kann man versuchen, Unterkategorien zu dem Begriff zu umschreiben.

The usual guessing game with a team trying to describe a word, phrase, movie title etc., and the rest of the players trying to guess it. The twist here is brilliantly executed, however: you’re using a tableau of very appealing pictograms to give your hints, and the well-designed tools provided by the game allow for a couple of subcategories to edge the crowd on towards the right solution.

Familiarity with the cards sets in after about ten plays, but this is not as bad as it is with other party/guessing games – it should work fine if you just snatch your secret words from a dictionary or encyclopedia or film lexicon or whatever.

This is an interesting game that requires people to think creative to describe an object, person, saying (etc.) using only icons.

Great game for just hanging out and killing time with some friends. One person picks a card and tries to convey one of the words or phrases on the card using only the icons on the board. Like charades but more clever.

No time commitment, very little to explain, and not very competitive, while still offering ample opportunity for creativity and critical thinking. Not even really a game insofar as getting points or working towards a win condition. There's an option for that, but even the instructions say that if you are playing for points then you are really missing the point of the game.

I describe Concept as "a think-y party game," and that feels about right to me. I love it.

The use of teams is a great twist on the usual one/many split in this style of game, and adds a neat dynamic. The option to choose words of a specific difficulty is great for ramping up (easy was too easy after one game -- just right). The board is well-designed, as is the lovely insert, and the variety of ways to convey information -- both in terms of graphics and the cube/pawn breakdown -- is fantastic.

There's even a bit of a group metagame that builds up, something I always enjoy: "They used that to mean 'X' last time, maybe there's another way to look at this," for example. And tons of room to be clever, both as a guesser and a clue-giver, while also enjoying how some concepts seem easy to convey but aren't -- and vice versa.

Being easy to teach and learn, and supporting 12 players, gives Concept a high chance of seeing the table at parties. It's a unique game in that niche.

A very unique thinking game. But the board does take some time to memorize what all the symbols mean. Concept is very thinky, you have to rely heavily on how good your partner is at giving clues, and the rules are kinda wonky. For a family game, it's frustrating and limits conversation. I'll pass.

Concept is, if nothing else, an interesting and unique game.  The board is comprised of several small pictures and symbols.  Players will use these pictures and symbols as clues to various "concepts" they are trying to get across to the other players.  The concepts are listed on cards that are drawn from a deck.  Each card has three difficulty levels.  Points are awarded to the player, or team, that first guesses what the chosen concept is, as well as to the player, or team, giving the clues.

Concept is very easy as far as rules go.  There are hardly any rules in fact, and the rule book basically tells you to play the game any way you want.  Having said that, it's a very thinky game both for the person/team giving the clues, and for those trying to guess.  I enjoy the challenge of doing both, and I recommend that you at least give this game a try.

RATING: 9.5
At first I thought: it's a nice idea but not so fun in practice. It's pretty contemplative for a 'partygame'. It's more of a 'coffee game', like chess except this one doesn't bore you out of your skull. Come to think of it, maybe world did need such a game. Just don't expect something like Telestrations that will make the room roar in laughter. Play this when you'd play Scrabble. The scoring system is terrible so it's best to play without it. I think Concept is best with lower player counts, like 2-6. Replayability is great, basically infinite, as you can use your own words if you want. Of course if you play this 100 times a year you'll develop patterns and that will be boring, but let's be realistic.

2-Player Comment:
* The original rules don't work for 2, but they really don't work for any other player count either. It's a good 2p game when you play it as an activity, just trying to guess each others explanations without scoring.

I tend to ignore the official team and scoring rules of Concept and invent my own. I typically play it as a co-op game, with everyone helping to reach a high score. The core mechanics are so great, so can pretty much play it without bothering with scoring at all, and it will still be a great gaming experience.

My second favorite party game. We don't play by the rules. Instead of teams, one person draws a card and then gives clues to what it is until someone guesses it, or everyone gives up.

My scoring system: 1 points for Easy, 2 points for Medium, 3 points for Hard (for both guesser & clue givers).  2 minute 15 second time limit.

A refreshing take on guessing games in that it does not use pantomime, forbidden words, sketching, modeling, lego etc.
Especially when the person placing the clues does not resort to any other means of communication this almost becomes an art form of finding, well, concepts. I like how this does, for once, not preclude people who are musically or artistically challenged from having fun.

"Often marketed as a good "party game", Concept can be described as Charades/Pictionary .. The idea of the game made perfect sense to me -- structured ideas, very much like a relational database .. I'm not sure if the theory behind "concept" is too abstract for others to grasp -- I see players puzzled when an example is being taught"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I really enjoy the concept behind "Concept". 

A game lasts as long as the players want to and provides a huge amount of variability by allowing enough room to customize your own distinct brand of house rules. In one game we ignored team based play and rather opted for a free-for-all approach when guessing, awarding a standard 2 points to the person who guesses the correct answer and variable points (based of difficulty) to the person who successfully conveyed the concept.

I'm surprised by how much I like this board game version of Charades.

So far this has seen lots of very enjoyable play.

Concept has players trying to guess words or phrases using pictures and symbols. It's a nice idea, though the game itself is pretty loose on the winning/losing conditions. The manual actual says something along the lines of "just play however you want, until you're done!"

As with most party games, it's recommended that you play it with a larger group. (4+)

Igazi TÁRSASjáték, a szó legszorosabb értelmében. Nekem nem is a barkochba jutott eszembe róla, inkább Activityhez hasonló az interakciók miatt, ami azért elég jó pont.
Ami számomra nagy pozitívum, hogy "mesélőként" is érdekes, sőt, másfajta kihívást igényel. Nagyon különleges élmény képek alapján megpróbálni átjuttatni mondanivalónkat.
Ebből adódik a talán egyetlen hibája a játéknak, hogy ha elakad az illető, a többieknek unalmas a várakozás és a vaktában történő találgatás (ugyanakkor sokszor igencsak mókás :) ).
A pontozásról fogalmam sincs, szerintem nem is érdemes vele foglalkozni. A Concept egy remek időtöltés, már csak az Imagine-t kellene kipróbálnom, hogy kiderüljön, melyiket vegyem meg!

For me, this is way better than Alias or Pictionary. The mechanic actually requires some thought and planning (well, it doesn't, but if you don't plan your explanation carefully, it'll be hopeless & frustrating for the other players), which I like: it focuses the game, adds a problem-solving element & removes chaos. 

Ok, you could probably remove the chaos element from aforementioned games by removing the timer, which seems to generate all the hassle. Anyway, Concept destroys those kind of party games (and the like) for me. That being said, there's basically no game here, but it's fun nevertheless.

I expected to hate this game, but it's actually pretty fun. It sort of falls into the same category as Dixit for me though. It's a little too much thought to put into what I consider to be a party game. On top of that, the rules are so open to variants and whether or not you should even keep score that I have a hard time classifying this as a game. Telestrations has the same issues, but that game is funny whereas this one tends to be a little more thoughtful. Don't get me wrong, the game CAN be funny, but I think that depends on the players more so than the game. In a lot of ways, this has the same issues as Pictionary. You'll have those funny games, but you'll also have those games where arguments can come up about how poor of a job someone did at giving clues. For me, this is a fun occasional activity, but I don't know that I'd ever request it.

Concept is brilliant. It's one of the few games which I feel doesn't need to be played as a game whatsoever. It's just something you can do - and it's brilliant. This is one of those games where you end up standing out of your chair, pulling your hair out, without even realising it. The idea is simple - convey a very simple concept to your teamates using only coloured cubes and corresponding symbols on a board. Think 'Charades' but you don't need to do any acting; all you can say is 'Yes'. Concept is practically zero set-up time, and a playtime of about 5-10 minutes, so it's great for a quick game. It's hilariously frustrating and wholly recommended. Again, don't feel the need to adhere to the actual 'competetive rules' (they even suggest this in the book). Just pick a card and start playing.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The only thing that lets this game down is the concept cards themselves. Things like that are always prone to being culture specific.

House rules (a time limit, better scoring options, perhaps eliminating the team structure, etc.) are a virtual necessity to turn this into something playable. Interesting as a conversation starter, but entirely dependent upon players involved.

Concept is really group-dependant. Can be a killer, can be a complete failure.
Though the original cards offer a big load of guesses, we tend to play in 2 teams and ask for the opposite team to find custom-made hard ones (but not impossible... veto is allowed).
Anyway, it is a very good game, that is to say a game where you actually have fun.

Concept é um dos mais recentes da coleção. Lembra vagamente, para quem conhece, o Dixit. Isto porque ele consiste em apresentar pras pessoas uma ideia usando outras ideias mais básicas. Levar os demais a pensar em Joana D'Arc marcando "personagem", "histórica", "feminina", "guerra" e as cores da França é fácil. Mas como você faria "jogar dinheiro pelo ralo"?

RATING: 6.2
Not really a game. Fun, creative exercise in a group. It can be incredibly fun/funny at times.

The main reason I don't rate it higher is because it always seems to wear its welcome for me. Due to not being a game, my group always wants to do 'one more card each'. What would be fun for an hour ends up being played for 2+. Thus, the first 30-60 min of playing are at an 8 enjoyment, but thereafter its at like a 4 for me. 

Keeping it as I have no other game that fits this niche.

--- Preliminary thoughts ---
The components are just great, not only in quality, but also in originality and design.

Very simple rules, super fast to teach and learn, you can be playing in a couple of minutes.

It features a really fresh idea for a party game, on the line of Pictionary, but way cooler. You point some concept designs preset in the game board and people have to guess. Concepts can be primary or secondary, allowing many different combinations.

It's not one of these party games with lots of laughs and funs, but it can be entertaining (again, something similar to Pictionary).

A possible issue: if you are not very imaginative, choosing the concepts can be a tough and slow process.

A good news: its price make it an affordable game.

I think there's too much hype around it. It's a nice game, but it's not something special.

It's not the kind of games I usually enjoy and I don't think I would want to play it past the first couple of games.

Gioco sul filone di Taboo o Pictionary che può ricordare Dixit. Ovvero un classico party game che probabilmente si apprezza maggiormente dopo diverse partite per via della sintonia che s può creare tra i vari giocatori. Spunto interessante, può essere apprezzato da gruppi alla ricerca di giochi un po' spensierati. Personalmente l'ho trovato poco accattivante e a tratti anche noioso. Bocciato.

The perfect antidote for gamers who feel reined in by prescriptive tree-climbing exercises. Concept takes some serious house-ruling even to qualify as a game, but it requires depth of craft and creativity and there is some glorious group-think going on if you play the game often enough with the same people.

Bonus points for uniqueness. Also aesthetics of the box and manual are great. A "concept" that can be taught in just a few minutes. Scoring it seems tedious, its mostly about solving the puzzle. If it were more like charades where you divvy up into teams that might make the scoring more important.

Una simpática reimplementación del Pictionary, que viene con una serie de dibujos en el tablero. Como resultado, las pistas son menos versátiles, la gente que no sabe dibujar tiene iguales posibilidades, y no es necesario tener un pizarrón o papel para jugar.

Mejor? No realmente. Me pareció que le faltaba el típico reloj de arena para dar por terminada la ronda cuando nadie acierta a adivinar. Eliminar el juego en equipo tampoco funciona, porque igual te tirás a acertar en voz alta, dándole información a todos; y los cubos, para hacer hincapié en una pista, también son limitantes y no funcionan, porque igual predominan las señas en silencio como referencia.

Concept is a party-style game that has been described as "charades the board game".  One player acts as the clue-giver, and places a number of differently-colored tokens on one of a large number of icons on the board, each of which represents a different concept, like female, historical, mechanical, death, etc.  (Players have a very large player aid to decode these, which is a bit annoying.)  Same-colored tokens can be placed on different icons to represent that they belong to the same aspect of the clue.  The clue-giver may give no indication of the clue besides the tokens placed on the board.  In any case, I thought this was pretty interesting, and would be willing to play it more.

I can only enjoy this on very rare days, as it makes my brain feel like the wikipedia server. A neat idea, but the icon system can't really represent stuff accurately, it has been simplified too much. Learning the icon system is still a pain in the ass though. And the rulebook is such a mess!

Another party game in the vain of "what am I thinking"?  Works best as a solo player game where you are trying to get at least one other person to guess correctly.  The player board has various pictures that represent concepts.  By adding markers to these pictures you try to get others to guess what you are thinking.  It's not as easy as you think!  I would highly recommend the large neoprene mat sold separately for this one - the larger pictures are a big help!

This is an ingenious game, where players communicate words and phrases by pointing to combinations of visual images. Basically, this is a version of charades that Stephen Hawking  could play. It is philosophically intriguing to see how anything and everything can be broken down in order to facilitate communication: I wonder if the game could be used as a way of communicating ideas between people who had no common language?  There's probably a PhD project there for someone.

Concept is quite a unique take on the classic party game mechanic of “get other players to guess a word.” Instead of using drawing, charades, etc, concept uses a beautiful board full of iconography. The clue-giver(s) for the round place tokens onto the icon in order to describe the word or phrase she is trying to get her fellow players to guess. The first token is a large plastic question mark that represents the main concept of the word. Then, cubes that match the color are added to give additional clues about the concept. If an additional line of thought is needed, the main player can place a second large token to represent a sub-concept and follow that up with clues of a matching color. The player who guesses the correct answer and the clue-giver both get points, and the turn is passed around the table. The game ends after a number of rounds and the player with the most points wins.

Concept is a very thinky game without feeling like a brain-burner. It fits somewhere in the same niche as Dixit, as a party game that will stretch your creative thinking. Unlike Dixit, concept seems more logical and “left-brained”. Players are forced to create a line of thinking that will illuminate the topic so that others can guess it. There certainly can be creativity involved, but clues that are too “out there” will leave the other players struggling to come up with the answer. This situation also highlights one of the problems with this style of game (think of Pictionary), where a clue is going nowhere, but the clue-giver just keeps giving the same hints. We experienced this situation in one game and it was frustrating for everyone. However, repeated plays should help smooth out those issues. 

So, while I think Concept is a fascinating experience, I’m not sure how good it is as a game. The rule book omits some details about how to define a game round and determine when a clue-giver is unsuccessful. In fact, an inset in the book states that the designers and developers often abandoned the scoring system and just played for the fun of giving clues and guessing answers. If this is something that will leave a bad taste in your mouth, Concept is not for you. However, if you can set aside your gamerly nature and just enjoy the ride, Concept may show you some new places.

This is a puzzle style 'activity' in how to effectively communicate under restrictions of only using icons and only saying 'yes' to questions/answers. Admittedly the design has competitive gaming features, but I suspect most will dispense with those.

However, there is a hurdle to the activity which slows the pace of play initially: both the clue giver and the audience have to search and take on board what the icons mean in order to comprehend what is being communicated. 

What I find interesting is the clue-giving process becomes a developing skill in trying to hone the communication, which sometimes requires a little creativity in regards of the use of the cubes, but mainly it is trying to get your team to get on track.

At times this can get frustrating, especially with dismantling and starting again, overusing the tokens/cubes etc. I guess a timer would just make things worse, so I guess the advice of just stick with the 1st level clues until the board/process is mastered.

Still an interesting exercise for those who like the restriction/cryptic clues and at times it generates discussion and laughter.

Move aside, Cards Against Humanity. Take a break, Codenames. This has become our gaming groups new favorite casual game, playing just as well with a small group of family members as with 10 of our intoxicated friends. 

While the cards may become stale, and some folks already have an advantage from having played before and having limited the pool of available subjects being conveyed, this game delivers. It's funny, it's fast, it's easy to teach, and it's interesting. 

A lot like Charades but with limiting how you can communicate even further, which then requires creativity and understanding how the other players think. Brilliant!

This is one of a zillion pseudo-charades games, and not a  good one. 

The dealio here is the use of an image board to communicate cues from cards instead of acting things out as in basic charades or drawing things (Pictionary, etc) or using limited words (Taboo, Password, 25 Words or Less) or whatnot. The imageboard manages to be both too big to communicate things clearly and yet too limited to have the sort of clues you want. That might be excusable if the images were either a bit more intuitive or if the reference sheet was not horrible. It's formatted different than the board for exactly no good reason, making it way too difficult to find suggested meanings of the icons.

Then as there is no time limit nor forfeit condition, the rules as written mandate that difficult rounds drag on in endless frustration with no exit clause other than success. 

The inclusion of "subconcepts" for communicating ideas is an interesting idea, but seems to do little more than create confusion in actual play.

The only good part of the design here is the way that clue giving teams rotate, more useful charadeslikes could steal that.

I like that it's interesting to watch and easy for players to drop in and out. I don't like how limiting it feels and how hopelessly hard many of the card phrases are to communicate. If I'm going to have to work this hard to be creative, I'd rather play a party game that rewards that work with laughs, like But Wait There's More or Funemployed.

A wonderful spin on Charades with a perfect marriage of thinky strategy and creative fun.
This is a party game for sure but it's innovative nature makes it a win for experienced tabletop gamers in that it encourages you to think outside the box with icons and cubes, nothing more.
Simple, stark look has never worked so well for a game like this for me :)

This is the gamers version of charades, and it does that well enough. I don't care much for the official rules on how to play and score, nor do I think most of the cards difficulty levels are at all correct. Some things are wildly impossible to communicate while some are trivial, and the cards don't often seem to get those differences correct. We have fun just using it as more of a sandbox and playing around with whatever words and scoring we want to at the time.

This is innovation, folks. Not the umpteenth small tweak of worker placement or deckbuilding. This. A big board of icons that can signify whatever you need them to signify at the time, confirmed or denied through the use (or not) of the word "yes" when someone asks a question. The game comes with a deck of cards that can serve as prompts, but you know what else will work to make clues about? [i]Any noun.[/i] Also any quotation, any song lyric, any place, any verb, any book title, any memory, or any shared combination of words that you can think of. 

Complaints that the game is more of an activity than a game are fair -- this is a party game, after all, and the scorekeeping is not strictly necessary. A bit brainy-er than your typical party game, but hell, those happen to be the kinds of parties I go to.

An interesting "game", even though I consider it more of a collaborative creative activity, like Charades. The "rules" are not actual rules at all and as soon as you get going, you toss the "rules" and scoring system overboard anyway and start having fun with the board and cubes. Still, it might be a tad too free-for-all for actual gamers and I would suggest playing this with a good mixture of gamers and non-gamers, maybe even the latter exclusively.

The concept of Concept is actually pretty genius. It is basically charades for people who are too embarrassed to act out the clues. Now, I love party games that feel like charades (Times Up is an all time favorite) but it's nice to have Concept around for when you want to include more right-brained gamers. The only problem I have with the game is that the difficulty ranking of clue cards is very subjective, and wasn't even close to our personal experiences. A better ranking system could open up a tighter scoring mechanic, but it feels silly to nitpick a party game. The components are really more of a tool to create your own, better, game.

This is a really tough party type game.  One really needs to use your imagination together to first pick the easiest clue and convey this clue in almost a charades like manner except you have pictures on the board.   These pictures can be used to make a direct clue or multiple clue layers that you can lace together.  Just a really interesting semi-cooperative mental exercise that really needs practice to get good at it.

An interesting little party game, which can scale to quite a few players across the two teams.

Some of the answers are incredibly difficult and some of the "sayings" aren't actually the correct sayings at all. One player, who speaks German, knew one of the sayings in German and it was a literal translation from there. But you can't do a literal translation like this for a game, it just doesn't makes sense.

A clever game that, I would say, isn't bad. Would partake in a game from time to time, but wouldn't be the one asking to take it out.

Disclaimer: I have not played the game - just a short demo. Rating is probably slightly higher than I anticipate it to be upon full play. I particularly dislike the fact that *some* familiarity with the game iconography is required (it's not bad, and possibly as good as can be, but not without issues). It feels like familiar party games with added components that seem to detract rather than enhance the 'concept' of guessing an imposed brief aka charades.

8.30.14 Played at Stratigicon. The game has some fun elements and is basically charades with a board. The real issue is trying to convey the words with ONLY the symbols on the board.

Rating is for game as is. This game can be house-ruled to become good but the rules as is are not so great. Note that I did enjoy playing this. But there needs to be a time limit to turns, a little more strictness to responding to players and how you can place things on the board to give clues.

Ultimately, there's a good game hiding in here waiting to come out.

Charades for more logical people in a group setting. you've got different bits so you can link ideas by the color of the bits you spread out. sometimes logic and a huge spread of icons isn't enough to get the point across, but it's usually good and quick. can be played with however many people, but it doesn't lend itself to a large party, i don't think (gotta fit everyone around the board). i have played this enough times. yeah. in the future i'd much rather play either Monikers or Deception: Murder in Hong Kong. or, you know, maybe a real board game since there's only four or five of us.

Really enjoyed playing this.  It's amazingly hard the first few clues to work out how to do it, then by the time you've played a bit you're even attempting some of the hardest phrases.  Very different to many other games because of the limitations of the board, and the lateral thinking required.  Not a game to worry about the scoring too much though - it's very cooperative trying to work out the clues, and needs to be to make it work.

I am a huge fan of games in which you home in on an answer as information is gradually revealed, like 20 Questions or Charades.  This take on the genre is very cool, where the player knowing the answer has to indicate the characteristics of the answer using icons, making the process more abstract than other similar games.  I enjoyed it a lot.  I would have thought that it would get stale or overreach rather quickly, but there seems to be enough on the board to create quite powerful descriptions.

I eventually would like to own this, but although it's good, there are usually other games that excite me more, and for which I can't scratch the same itch by playing 20 Questions, which requires nothing but the power of speech... and people who are willing to play 20 Questions...

This is the only Charades style "guess the word" party game I enjoy. You don't need to be able to move your body like in Charades, you don't need to be able to draw like in pictionary, you don't even need a large vocabulary or a ton of cultural knowledge, though those do help.

As a game, Concept is OK.  As an activity, Concept is one of the coolest things I've ever done on a tabletop!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Like many party games, Concept is more of an activity than an actual game. But unlike most party games, it's kind of quiet and thoughtful instead of boisterous and fun and lively. 

I kind of liked it, because it is an interesting way to get people to guess something; instead of actions or word clues or drawing, you have to choose different pictures and diagrams to lead people to the answer.

But I kind of didn't like it because it was somewhat boring. The clue giver seems to have the most fun, trying to decide which clues to give. But other people just kind of wait and then throw out guesses here and there.

I would definitely play again; I like games with group interaction and good party games in general. But I didn't really love my first impression.

Un juego más cercano a los clásicos juegos de mesa de dibujar o hacer mímica, en este caso utilizando la simbología. El resultado es un juego excelente, quizá no del todo terminado en cuanto a reglamento y puntuación, pero que con el grupo adecuado puede ocupar una tarde entera tarjeta tras tarjeta.

Por ponerle otro pero (aparte de la puntuación), es un juego que se da mucho a jugar muchas partidas, y jugadas con el mismo grupo se tienden a elegir las mismas palabras para adivinar. Se pueden repetir bastante.

Really unique type of "visual charades" using iconography to symbolize broad concepts and categories.

Players take turn drawing reference to enough of these icons that the remaining players can guess the word or phrase appearing on the game card.

People complain that there is not a lot of "game" here, but I find the distinction immaterial; this game does what party games set of to do: create fun and funny situations of social interaction through meeting a challenge - even though this challenge is not directly competitive, it is no less fun.

Concept is a great concept with pretty good execution. IMO it gets better if you supply your own word set (because the ones in the box aren't numerous enough, and perhaps are too easy) and/or your own board: I LOVE playing Concept rules on a grid of 25 Dixit cards rather than on the included board.

I was doing a very bad job when suddenly my 5-year-old son (and teammate) placed a cube on the purple paint icon. Everyone instantly got it. I was amazed. I never would have thought to give that clue, but now it seems obvious. That's Concept in a nutshell. Brilliant.

A quality party game, although it does need a little bit of house rules on it to be more fun. I suggest that everyone plays for themselves (instead of breaking into teams) and that everyone scores individually. Both the person giving the clues and the one that answers should get points, and the giver should probably get more points for the harder difficulty cards. Still, I enjoy this more than both Pictionary and Charades (which this is similar to), just because I think that you can get more across in this than in either of those games.

Very good game.  It also works well with children (I'd say from 8yo), and it's a hit with my daughter who is not strong on verbal skills and organising her thoughts:  that games somehow allows her to express things in a non-verbal way.  It's also quite enjoyable for people (like me) with language background other than English (or whatever language you are playing that game):  they would certainly need a dictionary to make sure they understand when it's their turn to lead, but then...  how enjoyable it becomes to use non-verbal clues in order to get a verbal answer. :)

Pros
- Fun group activity for a short period of time

Cons
- There's no real game here - it takes a back seat to the "activity"
- More than half the board is virtually useless in giving clues
- The scoring system is pointless
- Some of the "easy" clues are significantly harder than the ones labeled "hard"

Like Pictionary, this can be a fun activity to try out with friends, but gets old very quickly after about an hour.

RATING: 7
A party game for intellectuals.  That sounds snobbier than I wanted it to.  This game is really for people who want a fun activity (which it is more than a game, and proclaims it unapologetically in the rulebook) that gets the brain juices flowing because it requires a good amount of thinking.

When playing one player selects a card from a deck which has 9 words or phrases on it in 3 different difficulties.  They then select one to attempt to make the other players guess by giving them clues using pawns, tokens, and this board of symbols.  The depth and fun of this game comes from the need to be creative to deliver your ideas to your fellow players.  Some of the symbols on the board allow you to narrow down the selection to a general concept but bridging the gap to the specific can be hard.

Very fun to spend some time with a group of friends who like thinky activities.  If you need that competitive structure there are suggested scoring rules and you can set your own time limits, game end, etc.

I prefer more strategic games, but for a party game it is okay.  It is a twist on pictionary as the pictures are already drawn and you are trying to make connections between the pictures to get your team to guess the word/phrase. I enjoy telestrations more for a drawing party game.

It turned out less interesting than I thought. I feel that the designers found the mechanisms and designed the board, but could never really tell us how to play it. Nothing ever really feels right. Also, I have the French version, and they should have found a way for the game to be playable by someone not from France. The cards make this game even less interesting.

It's basically Charades for introverts. Instead of getting up and acting something out, you indicate sets of related symbols on a board showing many different kinds of concepts, from the concrete ("television", usually used to indicate that it is the title of a television show) to the abstract ("inverse/opposite/not").

Points are scored and no-one cares; you just marvel that someone has successfully communicated "Inception".

Extremely clever. I have little interest in playing again because I have little interest in party games, but I think it's an excellent design.

Very fun party game if you modify the rules a bit. Change it so that points are multiplied by the difficulty of the question. Although it is more of a simple party game so there's no real need to have score.

There seems to be a few icons missing that I'd like to see -- something like with normal trope categories (fantasy / sci-fi location, medieval / ancient location, horror / scary / fear location, action / adventure location). And maybe a category for "numbers" or something as well.

Either way, really love the game and think it is very neat.

This game is enjoyable. We had a lot of fun and it can be a challenge. But in the end I must echo the opinion that this is more of an activity than a real game. It's more of a puzzle. A 2-way puzzle. The puzzle to put together the right clues on the one hand and the puzzle to figure out the clues on the other hand.

Györgyivel és Gyulussal játszottam egy kört.

Nehezebb rávezetni mint ahogy gondoltam. A kötött mennyiségű felhasználható ábra miatt nem lehet elengedni a fantáziát. Nem az a könnyed partijáték. Inkább mérnöki pontossággal kell összerakni az asszociációkat, hogy a másik ki tudja találni.

Gyulusnál láthattunk néhány kreatív megoldást, ahol több kockát rakott egy-egy mezőre, de azért még eléggé el kell gondolkozni azon, hogy hova tedd a jelölőket.

Györgyi eléggé el volt veszve és az általam összerakott asszociációs ugródeszkák is éppen csak hogy elvezették a többieket a megoldáshoz.

Szóval érdekes kis játék, ami valahol félúton lehet az Activity és az Definity között, de mindenképpen a Definityhez közelebb.

Fantastic party game when you want everyone on the same team and don't care about scoring.

Concept is another iteration of Charades. It utilizes markers to indicate the main/sub concepts you are trying to convey and further refining it by additional cubes.

This game reminds me of Funglish. It's a parlor-style game and I don't see any real difference between it and other party style games. It's not really a game; its an activity.

Sure, you don't have to talk out of your butt while humming the star-spangled banner, but the answer levels vary wildly in complexity and the "concepts" are strategically missing key concepts while containing others that are rarely ever used. When it works, it's clever and funny. When it doesn't, it's frustrating and slightly broken.

Boring, that's the best thing that I can say about this game. Here, use these abstract symbols, try and get people to guess something that's specific on the card you drew, and you can weight it so that something is more important, you can say that this is the most important concept, and for a party type game, it's just a party killer. It seemed cooler watching it on Table Top with Wil Wheaton, but playing it in real life, it's a snooze fest.

Concept is charades, except instead of acting out the clues, you place tokens on a board full of symbols. The game comes with a cheat sheet suggesting possible interpretations for those symbols, but they often also have existing connotations that you can use.

This isn't so much of a game as an activity. It comes with scoring tokens, and theoretically there's a way to score, but it didn't really make much sense and it's more fun to play it without trying to keep track of points.

This was an okay party game I guess. Party games aren't much my thing, but I can enjoy them... my main complaint against them is that I'd rather be playing a real game. What really tanked this experience for me was that we split into four groups and two of the groups just weren't very good at the game. If they had been really bad at the game it would have at least been funny... but instead they would often put down a couple of tokens and then spend two minutes looking at the cheat sheet trying to figure out what to do next. Imagine charades where a player sits down for a couple of minutes between acting out clues.

RATING: 7
[thing=147151][/thing] is a game in which the players try to gess things (not just words, but names, even whole sentences) while the main player gives clues using the board of broad concepts, represented by icons. There are tokens that the main player can use to indicate the principal concept, others to indicate secondary concepts and cubes to pass further informations about the concepts. For instace, say the password is Robinson Crusoe. As main concept I can put the green token in "Book/Literary", conveying that the password is a book. Then I could put the yellow (secondary concept) token in "Man", meaning that the the book is about a man. I could put a green cube in the "Fiction" box, saying that the book is a work of fiction. A yellow cube in the Ship box, trying to pass the idea that the man is a sailor. And so on and so forth.

[thing=147151][/thing] can be played as everyone for himself or as teams. The person that gets the correct answer gains 2 points and the person giving the clues gains one. The winner will be the person/team with the most points in the end, which happens around 12 rounds - this is can be a rather quick game, if a timer is added, without it, when the players don't get the password soon,  the rounds don't have a defined end, only the shame-o-meter (the round ends when the person notice that the others won't get it right), which can drag the game somewhat.

[thing=147151][/thing] has advantages over the most usual guessing games: first, it doesn't requires drawing ability ([thing=2281][/thing]), which many don't have. Second, it doesn't requires acting chops ([thing=5122][/thing]). Finally, it doesn't requires much imagination ([thing=163][/thing]) nor knowing well the people you are playing with ([thing=39856][/thing]). Sure, these are all nice traits to have, but many do not, and being behind from the get go in a game just because you can't draw/sing/act/gesture to save your life, isn't the most "party" of all things. [thing=147151][/thing] leaves almost all of this behind (a good imagination can still comes handy), as it demands the players to break down the password into its basics building blocks - it is a mental exercise, and the requirement is knowing how to express an idea, a concept. It may sounds easy, however, sometimes is harder than one might expect - I think is harder than all those other games mentioned.

The game helps in this matter by providing cards with 3 levels of difficulty, each with three passwords. This makes [thing=147151][/thing] able to fit even in the most uneven groups - players can assume handycaps, like always going for the words in the most difficult set, while others are free to choose.

[thing=147151][/thing] is a fun game, with some pretty bits and a very clever board. The scoring part can lead to lots of constant shouts of guesses, as only the first to get the answer receives two points - but the game can be played without it, if the scoring doens't agree with you. However, what could prevent [thing=147151][/thing] from working is the learning curve or entry barrier, which are much higher than in other games of the same type. Breaking a password into concepts and understand it is, for instance, much harder than saying a sentence in [thing=39856][/thing], and, for the others, guessing is harder than just picking a card from hand that you think fits the clue and hope other vote for it. So, overall, for families and casual gaming, [thing=39856][/thing] would most of the time work better.

However, [thing=39856][/thing] entered in a tired zone in my group - we still play it, but most of us activelly avoid it. For gamers, I think [thing=147151][/thing], as it provides a higher challenge, can last more. [thing=147151][/thing] also has one advantage over [thing=39856][/thing]: it works better with 3 and 4, while [thing=39856][/thing] is best with 5 or 6. Finally, after playing [thing=147151][/thing] with kids and teachers, there is no doubt [thing=147151][/thing] could be a really effective tool in teaching, better than all of the other mentioned games in its niche.

Overall, approved.

This game is Pictionary on steroids!!  A very fun mind burning team game. My family loved pictionary so I knew this would be a hit and it was!!  It can be very stressful to articulate even the easiest of words which can turn into some good laughs. Some icons are hard to understand so there is a lot of looking to the player aid so we tell teams to have one person check and yell out what that icon represents to help speed things up. This game is a stressfully good time in a box.

An interesting and superbly unique party game.  It isn't the kind of party game that creates huge laughs, but one that makes people think in ways they haven't had to think before.

En concepto, su objetivo es adivinar palabras a través de la asociación de iconos. Un equipo de dos jugadores - vecinos en la tabla - elija una palabra o frase que los otros jugadores tienen que adivinar. Actuando juntos, este equipo coloca piezas juiciosamente en los iconos disponibles en el tablero de juego.

Para conseguir que los demás adivinar "leche", por ejemplo, el equipo podría colocar el icono de signo de interrogación (que significa el concepto principal) en el icono de líquido, a continuación, cubos de este color en los iconos para "comida / bebida" y "blanco" . Para un concepto más complicado, como "Leonardo DiCaprio", el equipo se puede utilizar el concepto principal y sus cubos de juego para los jugadores de pista sobre la frase escondida ser un actor o director, mientras que a continuación, utilizando iconos sub-concepto y sus cubos iguales para da pistas sobre determinadas películas en las que DiCaprio protagonizó, como Titanic o inicios.

El primer jugador que descubra la palabra o frase recibe 2 puntos de victoria, el equipo recibe puntos así, y el jugador que termina con más puntos gana.

RATING: 7
A pretty fun variant of charades but without any verbal cues. Concept is more of an activity than a game. While scoring can be implemented, a casual non-competitive game can also be had with plenty of fun. Players vie for points by taking turns offering pictorial clues and guessing the item or idea presented. The most novel aspect to this silent charade is that concepts can be offered in layers. For example, the first layer should denote the actual item/idea while subsequent "layers" of clues can each describe a certain attribute. These layers of clues can work in interlocking ways and provide creative means for players to present the clues.

RATING: 8
The concept of the Concept is brilliant! My first play of it was not too fun though, but it might be because of the strange group we had. I definitely want to play it again if it will work better or not (and then change my rating either to 6 or 8). My biggest fear is that if the guessing is too difficult, the game can stall badly.

hate this. I just don't get how someone can enjoy this game. It's just boring to explain things by only laying down cubes next to an image and hope that someone can deduce what you want to explain.
As mentioned, you try to explain a term to your partner, only by laying down cubes on the board (with icons next to them). 
Very bad game

RATING: 6
Quite good, but you have to memorize meaning of about 100 icons. If you do not, or if what you think that some icon means is different from what other players think, the game will not work.

good looking and quiet fun party game, feels very similar to Mysteres which has the advantage (in my opinion) to offer less constraints and a much smaller box ^^

[+] can be played with any number of players, can be played in teams, some very easy words (blue) and some much harder (grey) that require multiple sub-concepts, no real scoring needed, just play and enjoy
[-] big box for a party game... especially compared to Mysteres that offers a very similar experience

got in MathTrade Essen 14 -> left at home

got 2nd copy at home

EDIT: after several years of playing Concept regularly with different crowds, I see now how easily accessible it is compared to Mystères or other trivia games. I still think Mystères is more intellectually satisfying for me, but Concept is just easier to get out.

We play it as more of an activity than a game (we leave out scoring completely and just take turns trying to get all of the other players to solve one of the answers). It has gone over really well with everyone we have introduced it to. It's a simple idea for a game, but it allows for a lot of flexibility and creativity. I love the thrill of finally having someone guess the answer after I've been struggling with giving clues.

I'm not much for party games, but this one is a lot of fun.  It's like Zendo light!  I also like that you're not limited by the cards that come with the game.  It would be easy to incorporate cards from other games with similar kinds of subjects, like Time's Up! or even Apples to Apples (or just come up with your own!).  It's one of the few party games I've played with competitive people who wind up not caring about the score at the end of the game, so that's saying something.

Barely a game, but a really fun social activity. We pretty quickly dispensed with even bothering to keep score, and often make up our own words rather than relying on the cards. Some real potential for creativity, and surprisingly difficult to predict which words will be hard to get others to get others to guess and which will be easy. (We've noticed that the difficulty rankings on the cards don't correspond very well to our experiences!)

I can't understand if this game is completely stupid or part fun - part genius. But we actually had fun playing it so it's an ok party filler game.
We think it needs to be played with a timer. The difficult questions are too difficult for non english speaking people, there are too many phrases and ways of saying that are completely ignored here. It's much better if you can find an edition for your language . I personally would also give more points for more difficult questions. The rules are very vague about many aspects but we managed to have fun and this is the important thing.

[EDIT] Played the italian version. This game is pure fun! one of the best party games that i know. Possible house rules: 1, 2 or 3 points for the questions of different colors. Max time 5 minutes. If you guess before 2 mins double the points. Give points to the card explainer and to the guesser. The explainer can't say the color of the question in advance. if no one guessed, everone except the explainer get 1 point (or 1,2,3 pts.)

The game was just as good as I expected it to be, and I feel it was well deserving of its Spiel des Jares nomination. Although it has a "party game" premis, one should know this is not your average light hearted group game.  It is challenging for both the hint giver, who must break ideas down to the elemental level, and for the guessers, who are forced to think way outside the box.

RATING: N/A
A charades variant party game that can be played as teams or one for all. Timed, the clue giver takes a seemingly easy subject card and begins placing specific tokens which convey the main and subordinate concepts on the game board of icons.  You will soon be wishing for more or different sets of icons. I love the wisdom from the SU&SD play through... As the guessers, try not to focus on the icons themselves, but rather on the vocalized concepts that the grouped icons may represent.

This really isn't a game, but more of an activity. This is like Pictionary, Charades, and others where you are trying to get people to guess a topic based on clues you give them. The mechanism that concept uses is putting cubes on varied symbols on the board. To our group, this replaced the only fun part of the genre (drawing, acting, etc.) with a less exciting hunt and find exercise to find the right symbol, when giving the clues, or the definition for the symbol when guessing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Concept is an interesting word game.  You are trying to get people to say a word or phrase by placing cubes on images on a board.  You can use any given images for all kinds of different ideas.  It's an interesting experience.  It is charades without as much embarrassment and with a bit more creativity given your options for clues are fixed.  

This is also a game that we tend not to keep score on.  Rather than have teams and try to get a clue done in a specific time, we typically just have one clue giver and everyone else guesses.  It works great this way as an activity.  

If you aren't keeping score, then this is a game that is great for when you have a situation where people need to drop in/out of a game (start of a game session waiting for people to show up, end of the game session when people are expected to be leaving, watching kids...).  

One downside to the game that is a hindrance to me is many of the target words/phrases are based on popular culture (books, songs, films, personalities, etc.) and as such are going to get more and more obscure over time.  I would have preferred to see the game use more generic definition or historical statement types of items that are a bit more timeless.  There are a fixed number of clues in the game so it will get stale over time as the clue board doesn't change.  If both the phrases and the available clues both were random, then even if you got the same phrase you likely wouldn't be able to use the same method to get that stated (much like CodeNames) so this is a limitation.  And you can always come up with your own ideas to try to get across.  Just write something on a slip of paper and then go see if you can get people to guess it. 

Either way, it will be good game for a pretty long time.

Choose one then use different colored cubes to set them beside the pictures, hoping your team will guess correctly before the other team. Always fun, always funny, consistently one of my most played games.

I don't think this is as good a game as home-spun charades, but it is more accessible to the shy, as they have something else, the board, to get people to focus on instead of just all eyes always on them.  As such, it can get more introverted people to play a game almost as good as charades, which is definitely worth doing.

Wife's new favorite game. The comments are right though, the scoring is a mess. We normally play to 12-15 depending on group size, and let the active player pick a 1-3 point clue. If after 5 minutes no one guesses the right answer, no points are awarded, but if someone does guess, both she and the active player get X points.
Just as a note, because some of the 'challenging' clues are actually pretty simple, we house-rule it that the majority can shame those who scored points into taking one less if the 'hardest' clue was something like 'camel' or something silly like that.

Simple, but very flexible in terms of the player groups it can work well with.

An easy party/social game that is like charades but played with a board. The board has a wide range of symbols and icons onto which players place cubes to represent the clues, for example "tornado" might be a cube on the "wind" icon and one on the "spiral" icon. Different sets of coloured cubes allow players to develop sub-concepts to give deeper or extra clues.

Theme: Word guessing
Mechanic: Social/party game
Ideal players: 3+
Length Short-Medium

Tolles neues Spielkonzept, allerdings lernt man schnell dazu und dann wird es extrem einfach. Es sollten außerdem mehr Karten beiliegen. In den ersten Runden genial, aber nichts, was man zu oft spielen kann.

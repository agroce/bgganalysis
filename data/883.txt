Card game somewhat like UNO but with a little (very little) more control.  Colored chip scoring system seems flawed.  Not one of Knizia's better games.

A fun and fairly uninvolved filler.  There's not an awful lot to it...but sometimes that's exactly what you want.  The cards are nicely done and the game is very easy to learn.  It's playable quickly and it scales pretty well from 3-5, although I think it's best with 4 or 5. Not as good as Iliad, but that's a more complex game.

Another Taj Mahal-like card battle game.  Maybe my least favorite of the series, but I still enjoyed it and would play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a great thematic card game, relatively simple to learn and to play. It's a trick-taking game with specialized suits and some specialized cards, so if you like that kind of game (hearts, pitch), you'll probably like this game, too. And the theme is actually pretty well played throughout the game, so if you like combat with knights, that will be a plus (but folks can ignore that if they want). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
If the cards are against you, forget it.  I played an ENTIRE game once where I did not fight because it would have been futile.  Just way too luck oriented for my tastes.  A game where if the cards are against you, there's nothing you can do but sit and watch.

Fun little filler.  Sure, there's a lot of luck, but one usually expects that in a card game.  Requires patience as you build your hand, then pick your battles in suites you're strong in.  The lead often see-saws back and forth.  A good crossover game as well.

RATING: 2
IMHO, did not live up to the designer's name. Can be done with a basic deck of cards. Nothing war-ish about it, could be flowers on the cards for that matter.

Another UNO twist plus an extra bit .... That's it...

You run a tournament from 1 of 5 colors.  If the cards you play (plus neutral supporters) beats all of opponents, you win the tournament claim the prize and start the next one.  As always with card games some nasty things you can do to your opponent and help/protect yourself.  Another good non-gamer game to introduce people to gaming.  Okay with 2 players, better with more.  Plus at $20 or less, it is a good value.

Perhaps with only the number cards this would make a decent game.  However, the special power cards throw any semblance of control out.  The game also lingers on past a filler into tedium.  I hate that you no longer draw cards after you retreat from battle thereby eliminating the possibility of a hand management aspect (read: something to think about).

I really enjoy this game.  It has a nice balance between skill and luck and lots of interaction.  It reminds me of Condottierre a bit but both are definitely different enough to own at the same time.  The battles can be intense as players decided whether or not to push their luck, and the action cards add a nice randomness to the game.

2-5 | (4) | 45 min | 10+ | Reiner Knizia, Andy Lewis
The key is to know when it is best to battle and when it is best to wait. In any case, it feels a little bit random and is too light for me. Not the best game ever, but I would not say no to a game. Knizia's ability to make games out of a deck of cards and a couple of rules never ceases to amaze me (even if I find most of his games dispensable).

A Reiner Knizia classic, fun for the whole family!  Fast game play with many opportunities to stab your neighbor in the back!

RATING: 3
Interesting trick game that overstays its welcome with a dragging end game and silly "power" cards that are either game breaking unbalanced or impotent for when you need something. If you played without the power cards (i.e.; Gem Dealer) I think it would be great.

Looking forward to playing this with more than just 2 players.

Ivanhoe is pretty much Taj Mahal with all the interesting parts missing.  Blech.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
1 play. 
2 players. 

Ivanhoe is yet another meaningless card-based filler that falls far short of the standard Reiner Knizia set for himself with Battle Line (from the same year, incidentally).  In fact, the game largely recycles Knizia's hand-managament ideas from Loot, which I largely despise.

The flaws of the game are obvious and well known, so I won't get too far into them here.  Primarily, however, the game relies on randomly drawn and heavily situational special action cards that either clog a player's hand or (more likely) provide substantial benefits that overwhelm any of the strategic elements of the game play. 

I'm sure two players isn't the best number for this game, but I see little of value here for an experienced gamer.  I therefore have no qualms in labeling it outright bad.

Cray light game with some really interesting battles for chips.  Can be really fun to watch others duke it out and intense when your in a battle.  Can be frustrating losing chips to the maiden tho.  You can really get stuck with a bad hand and that isn't much fun.  Overall - a worthwile little game.

Fun, quick, but at times thoughtful Knizia fare.  Multiplayer is superior, and can be raucous.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is sort of an auction game in which players want to win battles of various suits (types of combat, such as jousting, swordfighting, etc.).  Its theme is pasted-on in Knizia style, so this is not a game for people looking for a rich Camelot theme.  This isn't my favorite auction game, but it's not terrible.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

RATING: 8
We have played with 2 or 3 players, and greatly prefer 3.  "You gotta know when to fold 'em."  Luck of the draw is a major factor in this game, but there is also a good catch-up mechanism.  Players who spend alot of cards fighting for one battle will deplete the cards in theirs hands, allowing someone who backs out early a good chance at winning a later round.

RATING: 4
Knizia seems very fond of making these light, fast filler games. Ivanhoe, when boiled down, can essentially be called Taj Mahal without the board and interesting scoring. The cardplay is essentially the same, yet much more chaotic because of a number of special action cards in the deck which can throw auctions for a huge loop. I think this is decent, and given its fast playtime tolerable, but nothing I would ever be pining away to play.

As Kenny Rogers once said:
"You've got to know when to hold 'em
 Know when to fold 'em
 Know when to walk away
 Know when to run".
That's the whole strategy of this game.  It's a blast, a simple card game of oneupmanship full of bluff, special cards, and dramatic reversals.  It's just great fun.  Looks nice too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun card game. Lighter but still requiring some skill. Lots of special cards do add to the luck verses skill but they do make it more exciting and proper play of those cards is still critical. With lots of cards the luck should tend to even out because its not like you will only get one or two in a round. Traded for Scripts & Scibes.

Another well-designed Knizia game.  The theme is arguably pasted on, as the game is at heart a rummy-style game for which many themes could apply.  The medieval tournament theme fits quite well, however, and we find ourselves playing this quite often with gamers and non-gamers alike.

[COLOR=#990000]**[Español** Siempre quiero jugarlo y en ningún caso negaré una partida a esta pequeña joya. El mejor juego de bazas o estilo "pocha" sin discusión posible, ni Tichus, ni muuu, ni bridge, ni subasta, ni ná... Se puede decir que es la versión en cartas del Taj Mahal.

Me agrada el comentario de MisterCranky, quien lo ratea con un 10, el cual hace referencia al Magic y dice "Me podría haber ahorrado los miles de dólares que tire en el Magic the Gathering si hubiera comprado este juego antes." Lo cierto que hay que tener mucha imaginación para esta comparación pero muy en el fondo no le falta algo razón, ya que el Magic básicamente consiste en robar, descartar (en el Camelot  lo consigue gracias a las geniales cartas tácticas) y "bajar" los 5 colores.

No juegues con la variante de poner las cartas especiales a parte como lo hace el Battle Line lo hace menos estratégico.

También en algún momento si te lo curras, puedes ganar un mano a mano y con ello una ficha, haciendo juegos psicológicos, genial. 

Casi siempre que pierdo me lamento de algún error.

El juego de Knizia favorito de Faidutti.

Esperando a la versión española de Crómola llamada Camelot.

He jugado al Ivanhoe sin las caras tácticas y ha funcionado muy bien el juego.[/COLOR]

Taj Mahal bolied down to its essence. A fun and exciting game full of bluffing and trying to time one's attacks perfectly. Much, much better than Great Wall of China, which in a way is a similar game, but without the constant tension of Ivanhoe.  There's a lot of action cards around that can perhaps sometimes spoil some carefully made plans - I'm a little bit worried that there might be too much chaos in the game because of those cards, but I'm not yet sure at this point.  Rating may go down if that happens to be true, or up if it doesn't.

I P500'd this at the millenium and didn't get around to unboxing it for an absurd 17 years!  Gosh why not!? I was put off by the mediocre reviews (which IMO seem nonplussed Ivanhoe has special action cards and is not simply Crazy 8s or Uno) and lack of reprint buzz.  However, this is is a great trick-taking/bidding game with a decent amount of theme, for a card game.  Not best at 2 player though and some dead time if a tourney carries on and you've withdrawn long ago. Overall though a great balance of luck, push-your-luck, take-that and card play strategy, but I think deck familiarity benefits veteran players, though new players can easily upset win in this fun filler.

Another milestone in Knizia's card auction game series, i.e., Loot and Great Wall of China. Not quite there compared to GWOC. Players still lack sufficient control to make meaningful decisions.

Camelot themed Knizia game, though not specifically Arthurian.  A reimplementation of [gameid=292] (which is identical to [gameid=37376]) with several additions.  I personally prefer the additions and game-play of Ivanhoe, but Gem Dealer has better components and is more suitable for children and families.

Nice, fast card game that has lots of interaction.  Good fun.  The people I've played it with have enjoyed it and it has the qualities of bluff, hidden information and spontaneity that I enjoy.  Not so much a logic contest as a game of instinct.

After ten plays, I find I really like this game.  It's consistently a fun experience.  It will never hit the highs of some other games, but I cannot imagine it disappointing either.  And, particularly with four players, there is quite a bit of strategy for such a simple game. 

It will never be the first game I grab for my group, but for Scout events or other travel occasions, the accessibility and compact size will make it a regular.  In fact, the Scout troop does like it a lot, and it allowed us to bridge up to Citadels.  Honestly, though, there are those that like Ivanhoe better.

For a card game, it is pretty thematic; I don't normally expect much from card games thematically.  In this game, the action cards make sense, and you somewhat feel like you are actually dueling.
------------------------
Edit:

I have found after a few more plays of Citadels that I am one of those that likes this game better!

Very fun trick game w/ jousting theme.  We often get sidetracked away from trying to win because of the short term fun of just blasting each other w/ the special action cards.  We should hold them for "just the right time" but they are too fun to wait!

RATING: 6
Ivanhoe is a card game where players fight tournaments in five different weapons (suits). The first player to win with four of the weapons wins.

A tournament is an auction round that feels vaguely reminiscent of the autions in Taj Mahal. Players can only play cards of the currently selected suit, and must bid higher than any previous player to stay in the tournament. Various action cards can strongly influence the results, e.g. by changing weapons in the middle of the tournament, or by discarding certain cards from the players' displays.

There is a bit of hand management going on, but card distribution and especially the action cards add enough randomness (or variety, you choose) to turn the game into a fun, short, casual filler.

One of my favorite card games. We've had a blast with this one from 2-5 players. It scales well. I'm always ready to play this one. Lots a decisions and surprisingly full of tactics. After owning it for several years, and playing it many times, it still fascinates me - and I find it to be very tactical. Yes, there's a lot of luck, but it is knowing how to best use your luck, when to drop out of a fight, when to "drain" another player, when to take the risk, when to exhaust your hand, etc. The more I've played this one, the more subtleties I've discovered. I also find that some players consistently win - meaning that they have learned how to maximize their hand.

Getting harder to find this game, which is too bad.  GMT quality is a mixed bag, but they are a small publisher so I like to cut them some slack.

It may seem light at first, but there are some fun tactics involved if you play your cards right, especially as you get a little more familiar with the game.

Gorgeous cards.  This is a decent game to play but not great.

Theme is pasted on.  Ivanhoe is a trick taking card game.  About as much feel of medieval fighting as regular playing cards.

Game is much deeper than it initially appears.  Lots of luck but no more than a normal card game.  Luck can be overcome by skill to a decent degree.
Game does not work well with two players.  One player can be stuck having to call tournaments he doesn't need while the other gains cards.

Fun, short card game with some interesting mechanics.  Making all cards played in a green tournament have a value of one is an example of that.  Definitely a game of streaks, however.  There's some strategy involved with what tournaments to start, when to withdraw, and when to change the tournament, if you have the right cards.  This is one thing that drags this game down a bit for me.  Last game I played, one player won three tournaments in a row and couldn't be stopped because the other players weren't getting the cards.

RATING: 7
A lightly themed card game that feels like a cross between War and Uno. One of the players starts with a card (or cards) of a particular "suit" (actually representing the type of joust tournament). The next player must play cards with ranks that is greater than the first set of cards. Other players continue playing higher ranking cards of the same suit, until all but one drop out. You get a card before playing a card, but that's it. If you win the tournament in that category, you win a disc. Win a disc in all five tournament categories (i.e. suits), you win the game. There are numerous "action" cards that manipulate the cards around, and modify the play.

Simple, fast, brainless fun for 20 minutes. Definite card-playing skills may be of help, but it seems like it's mostly luck. Not a bad filler game, and the theme is somewhat immersive after awhile.

It's quite interesting, at least at first.  It's a hand management game of accumulating cards slowly and spending them quickly, trying to convince your opponents to withdraw.  The text cards add some flavor.

The problem is that once it gets near the end, it will pretty much depend on what cards you happen to have in your hand, and at the point it also starts feeling a little long and tedious.  So, nice quick game at the beginning, but pretty "meh" toward the end. (1 play)

RATING: 7
Puteo e interacción aseguradas para un juego de bazas tan apasionante o mas que el tute o la pocha. A algunos les recuerda a Taj Mahal (no he jugado a este). A mi se me asemeja a Condottiero. Gestión de la mano con apuestas. Buena idea la de las cartas especiales que le dan sabor. Táctico. Hay que saber cuando salir de un combate a tiempo, cuando arriesgar, cuando agotar tu mano o cuando hacerlo con el rival. Contras: esperar a que los demás acaben un combate en el que estás fuera puede resultar muy aburrido. Dificil recuperar posiciones si has empleado muchas cartas y has perdido 2 o 3 combates. La suerte influye en la victoria o derrota.

RATING: 6
1st played 12/27/07. Taught in ~5min and played in ~45 w/ 6 players. If you've played Condottiere it has similar elements. The strategy/luck scale dips to the luck side more that I prefer. Bluffing works well with it also. Each player is dealt a starting hand of 8 cards. Deck contains 4 colors tournament (TMT) card colors. White can be played on any TMT. If white (or any other color) cards are played into a green TMT, they only count as value of one. A white princes (value of 6) can only be played once into any one person's play area at a time. Cards have value 1-7. There are also special cards which allow you to discard the highest card in play, steal a card, swap a card, swap color playing, etc. Starting player or winner of previous TMT begins TMTs. Players play card(s) into their play area and must beat the previous card total, if they can not, they pass (and take a card from the draw deck). The only was to get cards is to pass, so playing in a TMT depletes you. Last player in gains a chip in that color, he already has a chip of that color. If you win purple you can pick any color chip. The game ends when a player wins 4 TMT chips. It's worth a game play if you know someone who has it, otherwise I wouldn't recommend purchase.

Apr08: Actually, I think this is right up there with "best of breed".  It's very similar to Condotierre and it's ilk, but it's more enjoyable and fast moving.  I like how the game *will* end after a certain amount of time.  It's even reasonably thematic for being a card game about medieval jousting.

I recommend giving it a try if you like card combat waros.

One of the few Knizia games I've hated so far. It's sort of a climbing game in which playing cards lets you draw more cards, and passing means you are out the round. So rounds seem to naturally become two players endlessly one upping each other, while everyone else has to just set their cards down and find something else to do. The only way to get new cards is to play cards, so if you have a loser hand you're probably going to be stuck doing nothing for most of the game. I'm sure there's some hand management based strategy lurking in here somewhere, but the game is too dull to bother finding it.

Knizia auction game - Taj Mahal and Beowulf recycled the core auction mechanic, tuned to suit the new games. This one's simpler than either of those, consisting of just auctions, really, although the differing card types, the wild cards and the special cards add some depth.

It's a lot of fun, and certainly not as brainburning as Taj Mahal to play well. Good card draws will help your chances, but there are decisions to be made too about when to commit, when to hold back and when to use the specials and wild cards.

Can be a little hard to close out a win if the others gang up to stop you.

Nice artwork, too. (GMT 2nd edition).

Easy to learn... easy to play either seriously or for fun... a great addition to anyone's game library.

I'm utterly baffled at how low-rated it is on the geek. Most of the complaints seem to be about randomness. Big deal! This game is very playable and your decisions matter. And it's just plain fun, even after 30+ plays.

Ivanhoe succeeds wildly at being the kind of game it's trying to be. It is my favorite game of its category. Paradoxically it manages to be both brainless and interesting at the same time.

RATING: 8
Far better than Gem Dealer IMHO, this is a game as much about when to withdraw vs when to attack.  It's biggest problem therefore is likely in how unintuitive that type of play is to first time players so I think it suffers from not having enough time to explain that to first time players.  We do enjoy this as a 2 player game as well.  One trippy thing about the game is there are two types of wilds.  White wild cards that can work for any fight, and the purple cards themselves where winning lets you chose any color token in place of purple if you desire.  Manipulating the timing of playing these will most often determine the winner vs. just playing any card you can until you cannot beat your opponent and must withdraw.  There are quite a few special action cards in this game as well which really helps the theme come across.  Let's face it, almost ANY simpler game can be accused of having a pasted on theme but in truth most of the action cards really work theme-wise.  Even the various colors such as how green works for unarmed combat or even that jousting (purple) is far most prestigious to win.  The Drop Weapons Action that then changes the color to green (Unarmed Combat).  It's just always worked thematically for me and a big part of why I still enjoy the game after all this time.  Occasionally gets mathy when you have to add up the cards in your display past 20.

Joust with poker cards...a tantalizing combination.  Potential PC game subject. A nice turn for GMT away from all the more traditional wargame.  Money from selling this kind of game perhaps can subsidize the development of the more niche historical wargame.  I don't like this game, however.  The drawing of cards is random to determine your colors to joust.  The choices to shift the colors are limited.  Every player is trying to reap the benefits from thier own "long" suit as each successive player must either withdraw, or play a card/cards that exceed the previous player’s sum and follow the suit, or play a supporter card (the "wild" card) to change the things. Why a mere facelift for a simple poker system inside?  A disappointment from Reiner Knizia.

There's a few problems with Camelot : first of all, it tends to get longer the more players are in the game. Also, waiting for the other players once you're out of a battle quickly becomes boring. Lastly,  it's almost impossible to make a comeback if you loose two or three tournaments in a row after having spent many cards : being short handed is a killer. Oh, and as far as I am concerned, playing "Retreat" to take back your "7" card then "Countercharge" to take out your oponent's "6" then replaying your "7", should be treated as an illegal move. Other than that, Camelot is a fun and devious little game, definitly worth a try.

A light card game with a nasty "take that" aspect. I like this better than Condottiere because it plays quicker, but I suspect that Condottiere is the better game (more opportunities for interesting combos and devastating plays).

Good clever little card game with only the slightest feeling of fighting. Good 'gotchas', and moves quickly.

[-]For 2 players, we liked the variant rule, 'loser starts next tournament' better than the standard, 'winners starts next tournament'.[/-]

For 2 players, we use the standard rules as written, which have served us well after dozens, and dozens, of plays.

Oh, but we use a great LOTR mini to represent the player who has the field. Sword and armor, great atmosphere.

Il ne s'agit pas du meilleur "petit jeu" de Knizia (il est clairement moins bon que "Schotte-Totten", par exemple), mais on ne peut nier qu'il est très dynamique et engendre des parties très sympathiques autour d'une table. Le même système de cartes est entièrement repris dans "Taj Mahal", mais de manière plus subtile et moins chaotique.

Este juego de cartas es rápido y sencillo. Pueden jugarlo 2 a 5 personas. Consiste en ganar los torneos y obtener los premios de cada color. Para ello deberán ganarse cada justa con el numero mas alto en la apuesta. Puede ser ayudado por algunas cartas que representan aliados  o  eventos que afectaran a todos o a solo un jugador. Me encanta el diseño gráfico de las cartas, mas no el material de las mismas. En todo caso es un juego que vera muchos torneos ya que a los niños a mi esposo les ha encantado.

I love card games, and I did like this one.  It was sort of the card version of Taj Mahal--very similar mechanics.  But the win condition was weird--you play a series of tournaments, each tournament ends in a particular color, if you win the tournament you get a token of that color, you win the game by collecting a token of each color.  I had EIGHT tokens (five colors needed to win) and couldn't win because I kept not drawing cards in the one color I still needed--frustrating.  Maybe a house rule--turn in unneeded tokens to draw more cards?

This one strikes me as UNO for adults. I don't usually like filler card games, but this one seems to have some potential. It can be really boring if you don't have the cards, sitting idle round after round. Also, the balance of cards seems heavy on the action cards. With a handful of action cards and no suit cards to battle with makes for a tedious game. The obvious problems with it (waiting through rounds, unbalanced deck, and sporadic length of game play) really bring down this card game.

RATING: 6
From what I can tell after one play, this is a middling Knizia to join Palazzo.  I was ahead all game, but had no Joust cards.  The player who had won nothing all game crept quietly to the fore, since he had socked away a dozen cards earlier.  When it came to the final joust, he dropped ten purle cards and three White cards.  Game over.  So there seems to be some strategy and bluffing, but not enough to compensate to overcome the card draw advantage.

A Knizia game, where one plays knight cards out of their hand (vaguely similar to the Condottiere mechanic) to win tournaments. Win 4 tournaments to win the game. I felt that it was fairly random, especially with the "Riposte!" cards. In fact, now to make fun of games with a random effect, I use the "Riposte" words and people understand. The game is fun to play once or twice; I've played it three times and my friend who owns it has not (perhaps thankfully) brought it out.

Initial rating, January 2010. What I'd call a medium-level Knizia design--somewhat similar to "Battle Line" but really geared for more than 2 players, as I'd only rate the 2-player game a "6". With 3, however, it becomes quite tactical.  It's basically a trick-taking card game, based on card colors and numbers, with "Action" cards that essentially allow their holders to mess up others' hands. Typically thin theme in a Knizia design, as this could as easily be about boys fighting on a playground and choosing to use rocks, sticks, fists, etc. Nice artwork printed on 110 sturdy, laminated cards. Also comes with 25 small plastic chips, in 5 colors. Purchased January 2010. Very happy to report that my non-gamer wife and non-gamer 15-year-old stepson learned it quickly and liked it.

We played without action cards first time round. It gave us a feel for the game, but obviously you don't get the full flavour. It seemed ok. We had short everyone-pass wins. We had long 12-cards-each type duels. Our game evened out until there was a winner-take-all situation. Didn't grab me.

This reminds me a lot of another Knizia game, Beowulf: The Legend, except this reduces it to just a pure card game.  I really enjoy this kind of bidding and one-upsmanship, though at the end it becomes a little frustrating when people don't have cards of the one color they need to win.  There's a fair bit of take-that and randomness, but if that doesn't bother you, it can be fun.

An interesting trick taking card game. Play goes around increasing value, until all but one player drops out. Staying in combats you don't intend to win is a way to discard cards, since you draw for every card played. When you drop out you gain a card, and the winner gets a bit weaker by not getting the extra card. 
Learning when to cut your losses is critical

Impressed with this after the first play. Simple card game, but requires thoughtful timing choices, adjustments to random card draws.

The simplicity of a filler game and the thoughtful choices of something more complex.

15-02-2015. Rated after 1 play. Knizia game in which the theme is PASTED. Regardless, I liked it. Ivanhoe is a hand-management game in which you are a bunch of knights trying to win tournaments in 5 colors. 

Each tournament is played similarly. First, the starting player draws a card and then determines the color by playing a card from his hand with a color and a number. Opponents draw a card and then have to exceed the number and match the color. If they can't they're out. Play continues similarly. 

Besides the numbers and colors, there are white cards that are wilds and can be added to increase the value of any tournament color. You can also have white cards that change the color of the tournament or have you discard some.

I did like Ivanhoe. It's light, but fun diversion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Really nice card game - I much prefer this over Condotierre which is quite similar mechanically - just more straightforward, faster play, and has more of a push your luck mechanic, since you are getting to draw a new card at the beginning of each turn, so even if you've got nothing left to keep competing on the trick, there's a chance with your next draw.

Ivanhoe strikes a great "fun per time-invested" balance. It works for my younger kids (9+). Two of my sons are WBC Juniors champs :)  A very high rating for such a simple game, but we love Ivanhoe. Even years later, I find this still tip-toeing in-and-out of my personal Top Twenty.

This game was a huge surprise for me and my group.  I'd read many mediocre reviews of this game, so I'd avoided it until I played it at WBC.  Wow, were those reviews wrong.

At first glance, Ivanhoe seems like a take-that luck fest that lasts too long.  And it can be if your group plays it that way.  But if you look underneath the surface, you'll find that Ivanhoe is deeper that it first appears.

Yes, there are seemingly random "take that" cards, but those "take that" cards don't create random chaos---they create the tension that elevates this otherwise straightforward push your luck card game into one of the best fillers I've played.  

Once you play Ivanhoe few times, you'll start to see layers of gameplay.  How long should I hold back gathering cards?  Too long and you'll let another player win.  How much should I invest to stop this player from winning now, even though I cannot win this tournament?  Have the other players played enough green cards that I can start a green tournament this round and win it easily?  How much should I invest to win this tournament in a chip I already have just to maintain the initiative?  When do I gamble with my maiden card?  Is now the right time start a purple tournament even though Unhorse is still out there?  To answer these questions, you need to pay attention not just to what colored cards and action cards have been played, but also the play style of the other players at the table.

You can find Ivanhoe for pretty cheap.  Do yourself a favor and just try it.  Play it a few times and you may end up agreeing with me that this is one of the most fun and overlooked card games on BGG.

[GMT 07 edition, 2nd printing] {Medieval; fighting, bidding-variant, utility cards; optimal 3-4p} Ivanhoe is a brutal and fun card game.  It is easy to teach and learn.  Player interaction is strong.  Replayability is good.  It is game of hand management and risk calculation.  The action cards provide lots of surprise.  Some players may despise the action cards for chaos but I find it very fun.  It is a good filler for gamers or boys ^_^  Luck is important in Ivanhoe but players still have chances to build up good hands during the game.

The cardstock is thick enough for multiple plays.  The card illustration is ok and card information is effective; however, I would prefer nicer victory chips (at least some tokens will illustration).

This game is a bit like Taj Mahal without the board. However it is nowhere near as good as taj Mahal. I'me sure there is a good game in Ivanhoe somewhere but we haven't quite found it. The problem with the game is that it tends to go on forever, due to the fact that as soon as somebody nears winning everyone gangs up on him, pegs him back and prolongs the game.

Though its not the same, its along the lines of the card only part of Taj Mahal. You do card "battles" and the last person to survive gets a marker. Get enough different colored markers and you win - so its all about picking the fights you can win and managing your hand.

RATING: 5
This is a long filler, but too long to be a good filler, and too luck-driven to be a good strategy game.  Timing is very important in this game, and it really helps if other players have a nice draining battle ending in a Pyrrhic victory for one of them.

I liked Attacke back when and was interested in trying out Ivanhoe, which adds special action cards. Sadly, the special cards don't do much for the game. Also was disappointed in trying this out with two players after seeing this on a Geeklist of recommended two-player games. All in all, either the core game hasn't held up well over time, I initially overrated Attacke, or Ivanhoe is a pretty lackluster reimplementation of the game. Whatever the reason, I found Ivanhoe to be a bit of a disappointment.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I would only really recommend this game as a quick filler with three players. The &quot;stuff the leader&quot; element could make it drag on too long with more players. The best part of the game is the theme, so make sure you play your role: &quot;Sir, thine nefarious blow upon my pate with yon morningstar has wrothed me. I challenge thee to a contest of lance and steed!&quot;

I played this abstract card game twice as a four-player game, and it has some nice tactical elements to it, but, at the end of the day, it's just a dollar-auction, and suffers from the same flaws.  Good filler game, and certainly fun for the first few times one plays.

Awesome filler.  It feels like combat.  The battles become must win.  Only one play, but I was left mesmerized.  Just a tad on the long side for what it is.  I am a sucker for the card based auction.  A grande ole time when played.  Its just too long for what it does.  Taj Mahal doesn't increase the time tremendously, and does everything much much better.

Desire to play has seriously waned over a couple of plays.

[thing=883][/thing] is a light-medium (for the usual fare of) escalation games. In the game, the starting player of the round chooses a color to be in dispute, putting in the table one or more cards of the said type. Then, in order, players buy a card and decides to pass or to enter/continue in the dispute. The next player always must put in the table an amount higher than the last player did.

The players must follow the suit (color), but there are cards - white cards: the squire and the lady - that can be used in any dispute. The player with the highest amount after everyone passed, wins the round and takes a chip in the color in dispute - if the dispute was for purple, the player can choose to take a purple chip or any of the other colors. If a player used a lady in the dispute but lost it anyway, he/she must lose, if possible, a chip (the player chooses which color), that returns to the pool.

There are also a lot of special cards with many effects that are useful in many ways, from changing the type of dispute, to steal cards, and so on.

The winner is the first player to get chips of 4 different colors.

I found [thing=883][/thing] interesting and fun up to a point: when I saw myself out of cards. At the start of your turn, you buy a card, but only if you are in the dispute, so, if you pass, you no longer take cards. This means that, if I have, say, 1 card, I buy 1 and pass. The next player, which has, say, 5 cards, buy one, use one, and, thus, stays with 5. In my next turn, since I already passed, my turn is skipped, so I do nothing. The next player, buys one card, may use one, and, so, stays again with 5. If the round ends, for the next dispute, I will have 2 cards, the next player will have 5 or 6 cards. My turn will probably be: buy one card and pass. Therefore, after I participated in three or four disputes, I was basically out of cards to be used (I had one card, and it was a special card).

The game just ended for me, but the game still had about a third of it to be played! I bought a card and passed. That was it, up until the game ended. I get it that this is as it is to serve as a way give everyone a shot - one player might start the game with better cards, but can enter dire disputes that require the use of a lot of cards, and, thus, the other will have a chance to win the next ones. But the way this same thing happens in games like [thing=21654][/thing], where, after the round ends, every gets three cards - if you used a lot, you will be behind the others, but one round out might be enough for you to return as a real factor to the game; or like in [thing=112][/thing], that when all but one player has no cards, everyone gets a full hand of cards.

Also, I could just had had bad luck, because most of the cards I bought were special cards, that, although useful, aren't enough to keep you in the dispute, since you must play at least one color card of the type (with a value higher than the last player played) to stay in the dispute.

Sure, hand management is paramount in the game, but once you started a dispute, you don't know if the other players will pass, or quit, after just one or two cards, or will take the dispute up until 20+ points. And, after a point, you are basically "pot committed" - you just have to continue playing cards, otherwise you will lose all the other you already played in the round, and lose the chance to ever win that color again.

So, in the end, I liked the game while I was in the game. After I was out, not so much.

First play - 3 players. I love the theme of this card game. Knights battling each other in 4 different types of combat. The large amount of SPECIAL cards tends to unbalance the game but they do add a lot of flavor to the theme. SOme are over-powered and once you recognize those and use them wisely you should be able to defeat your opponents over the long run. It moved fairly quickly but it may be a bit too long for some people's liking as this isn't much more than a TAKE THAT! filler.

An oldie but a goodie from Dr. Knizia. I enjoy the push-your-luck elements here and well as the chaos than the designer was brave enough to add in. Plays well with non-gamers and those used to more commonplace (read: chaotic) card games like Uno, etc.

Good game, but ultimately a pain to try to understand/remember all the rules.

RATING: 5
1-5 plays. I was extremely disappointed with this as I was convinced I would really like it. It oozes theme and I think the Fellowship/Ring to Mordor/Hunt mechanism is excellent. However, at its heart, it's a wargame - and a distinctly average one at that (if anything it reminded me of Axis & Allies but not as slick). The game is overly long with much of the time spent fiddling with the pieces and understanding the plethora of rules nuances and the exceptions created by the cards. Whilst the board and pieces look extremely attractive, in game terms, the implementation is poor; Mountains and regional borders are not particularly clear; units just don't fit in the regions and regularly cover key cities/strongholds which, if you're not totally familiar with the map, can be fatal; the decision to (presumably) cut costs by making allied nations all the same colour makes it virtually impossible to distinguish them resulting in a distinct loss of gameplay and a feeling that you spend more time trying to understand where you are rather than actually playing the game. Now I accept that this is based on one play and familiarity will address some of these issues but I found Squad Leader easier to take in and less clunky after one outing and the prospect of spending another 20 or 30 hours just to get to a level where I can start to think about enjoying it as a game is not my idea of fun. I'd be happy to play again but I would much prefer it if some of the theme had been sacrificed for playability and a shorter playing time. And a final note, to flag this as 2-4 player game is merely to satisfy the marketing people. This is a 2 player game. The rules for 3 & 4 are tagged on at the end in an attempt to sell more copies.

This was a fun game, but sure will chew up a game session. It has a hell of a lot going on, and a lot of decisions compressed into each turn.  I would have to play many more times to learn all of the nuances for the different strategies.

Tentative rating. The system seems very detailed and flexible, but my first game was somewhat lackluster. I was playing the Free Peoples, and my opponent, as the Shadow, wasn't comfortable enough as a gamer to play as aggressively as that side warrants.

Tentative rating after one play using introductory rules.  The introductory game is a superior Risk-like wargame but one with more interesting decisions to be made.  Am looking forward to the standard game.  I'm guessing that my rating will go up with addition of event cards, characters, minions, and a more complex Fellowship movement system.  All in all, I am very impressed.

This game balances thematic elements with euro style mechanics as well as war game mechanics. 
It is hard to describe the feeling one gets when playing War of the Ring. I can't imagine a game that captures the feeling of being the Free Peoples Army or the Shadow better than this. It is truly an amazing game.

RATING: 9.6
Awesome game. Excellent bits and board, very immersive. It is probably my favorite 2-player game, and it is THE definitive Lord of the Rings game. If you want an epic Lord of the Rings gaming experience, this game cannot be beat.

During the game, both players must allocate their actions between the fellowship of the ring (either finding them or getting them to Mordor) and the War between the Free Peoples and the Shadow. Each nation has their own miniatures and the cards do a very good job of reenacting situations (or possible situations) from the books. The action dice are a cool part of the game that can force you to alter your strategy a bit, but still gives you a ton of choices.

I love the full game, but also enjoy a variant on the intro game I made that cuts out the cards (thus, cutting play time in half) and is more balanced than the original (broken) quick-play rules. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The re-telling of the War for Middle Earth with every play. Theme, theme, theme. The 3-point fonts on muddy card backgrounds is one drawback. For me the other gripes people have are legitimate, but not too much of a problem for me. I have a defective board, but that doesn't hinder the enjoyment a bit.

Intricate mechanics weigh down the game. Luck dominates strategy. As getting the right cards at the right time and rolling the actions you need for the turn or actually getting the hits you need for success, can all get in the way of careful planning.

A strong  theme and the sense of doom, can be felt while playing. Components and artwork are of a high quality (although the text is a bit small on the cards). Really shines as a 2-player game.

Ok, the 1st play is under my belt. Can't really give a honest opinion about the game yet but it sure seems to have some good qualities. Basically the game is like Risk but when you add the strategic planning of how to manage your resources the game gets more depth. Should you concentrate on mustering troops and leading 'em into war or should you try to finish the game by deciding the fate of the Ring.

But I really must say that you have to be familiar with the story or you won't have a clue what's going on.

This is a classic and the only game that I painted its minis. It took me months but I enjoyed it. I will never do it again ever but my experience with playing with painted minis is vastly enhanced. Now about the game, it is grandiose, ambitious, deep and really long but I love it, the 2nd edition rules are a very good upgrade. Rules are complex with many, many exceptions, your first games will take 3-4 hours minimum with most of the time reading the rulebook but it is very rewarding and the theme is all a LOTR fan could ask for.

RATING: 8.5
From a design standpoint, it's simply breathtaking how faithful this is to the War of the Ring story.  Any one who's looked at the fiction of the War of the Ring can appreciate just how non-linear it is -- in fact, this is what made me eventually realize just how more universal the Ring trilogy is than Star Wars could ever hope to be.  

Everything is here, the brutal grind of the armies flung at one another juxtaposed with the vital quest to render the ring.  And the game itself, in the 2nd edition is just fantastically, lovingly produced;  you can simply feel the positive energy that went into its creation knowing the design itself was already proven and successful.

Still, I have to say this game didn't entirely work for us, and least not in the sense that we want to play it alot.  This is a bleep-we're-snowed-in-for-36-hours kind of game -- not the kind of game you want to impulsively play again immediately after finishing.  The quest of the ring is exhausting for all, the stakes so high, that it makes no sense to trifle with it strictly for diversion. 

This is a game you must be prepared to live....

RATING: 7
The LotR theme is very well woven into this game, resembling very much the actual situation known from the books. The components are beautifully made and if you like detailed plastic miniatures, then you'll drool happily over what you get here. The mechanics works well, you draw cards (random factor), roll dice (random factor) and then decide what you do based on what you get, which makes strategic planning and choices possible. Combat boils down to a simple dice rolling mechanic. This is the type of game where a good strategy will win the game only occasionally. There is unfortunately too much 'luck' involved for me to find it really awesome.

RATING: 10
A very tight design! The designer captures both the Fellowship of the Ring story involving taking the ring to volcano to destroy as well as the battle for Middle Earth and the return of the King and the ascension of Gandalf.  Much of the story (at least as much as I know it) is contained in the game while and you are playing a great game of resource, dice, and card management.  It's a bit long, but so were the books and so were the movies: you simply cannot tell this epic tale in a short setting.

I guess I don't understand the game.  I've only played the FP side twice and felt like I just didn't have anything to do except wait for the SP to attack.  Kinda boring for me.  Got lucky and moved the Fellowship fast in the early game, and unlucky in the end when drawing Shelob's Lair and eyes which really hurt.

I played this game several times now and I find it an absolutely great game. The victory condition to bring the Fellowship to Mount Doom to destroy the ring or to win by victory points makes this game outstanding. Especially the event cards gives this game a wonderful atmosphere. However I am giving it a 9 for the "simple" combat system.

RATING: 7
I suspect that this game is ultimately one of the biggest disappointments I have ever experienced.

While I love everything else about it, the endgame is shocking - Fellowship journey into Mordor feels like a luck of the draw issue and after the ridiculous amount of effort it takes to get there that's not good enough.

I'm really unhappy about that because the rest of the game really works.

Trade: Includes battles of the third age expansion and I would rather swap the whole lot (battles of the third age is in the main box and does not have its own packaging)

The setup alone for War of Ring was extremely complex, and the game play only continued that trend. A few moments of geopolitical genius flared during our time in Middle Earth, but we were ultimately left wanting.  I hope a few more times playing will change my opinion of this great looking game.

This game does a great job of capturing the theme and spirit of the story while not going down the slippery slope of being scripted. All of the elements you'd expect to be in the game are there and then some but you are free to rewrite 'history' or follow the same path. There are so many options available to both players that I doubt the game will play out the same way twice. Sure, there are several seemingly sure fire overall strategies that are mentioned a lot but even if both players try the same strategy twice they will always be different since the cards are such a significant part of how the game unfolds. Lots of choices and tension all the way through to the end. The corruption buildup at the end of the game seems a little harsh on the Fellowship but I guess that's really the way it should be otherwise it would seem too easy! Overall, a solid game that I'd play almost anytime if I had the time.

Oozing with theme and flavor in every way possible and successfully captures the aspects of LOTR as a narrative. However, the rulebook is a bit too conversational and poorly organized and the amount of exceptions to rules is daunting.

Neither fish nor flesh (aka: Wargame or Eurogame). Feels like being driven by the game-system and not by the players. For me too much based on the "draw the right cards at the right time" syndrom. And I hate having a rulebook + x pages of errata + x pages of FAQ. Looks like every rule has at least two exceptions. Didn't work for me.

If you want to relive the LoTR saga and see how things could have turned out differently then play this game.

If you are a LORT fan this game may be for you.

I really had a great time playing this, and I look forward to playing again. It was a bold design choice in this age of streamlined European games and I applaud the result. Sometimes it's nice to just hunker down and play a beautiful game with moderately complex rules, especially when all the exceptions to the rules make sense and enhance gameplay. Like all good games, this one will continue to get better each time it's played.

Bring elements of card-driven wargames (the cards themselves and the action dice that have a similar limiting effect on options) to a simple buckets o' dice combat system. Add a cleverly abstracted sub-game in which the Fellowship treks towards Mordor, dogged by Sauron's minions and picking up corruption. Add a varied set of characters and interesting decisions over how to use them best.

The graphic design seems to place looks over function; you will frequently be squinting at names and borders, losing important details under masses of plastic pieces, struggling to remember the meaning of pretty, but opaque icons.  Those plastic pieces are also very good looking, but less than functional.  The different Free peoples are too hard to tell apart.  I found the rules a bit verbose, but not nearly as messy as I'd been led to expect.

Despite those minor criticisms - and not having read the books or seen the movies - I found War of the Ring a highly immersive experience.  The various elements all come together brilliantly.

Started off playing a few rules incorrectly, but as time went on we improved.  Rated at 7.5 not because of the lack of enjoyment but because the time required (we went well over the suggested time - although it was our first game) means it will not see regular games.

RATING: 6
Besides to big plastics - what's wrong with counters - for to small areas, the whole game doesn't feel like a solid whole. Didn't they know the card driven games. It could have been a great source of inspiration and proper game design. The cardtexts are often too long and too complicated. There is no timeline and cards appear random. The decks are too large and I do not see the usefullness of the double card deck.

Most of the action takes place in Rohan and Gondor, since it is very time consuming to move armies large distances. So I was wondering why there so many miniatures at all. And why doesn't the game start in The Shire as in the book.

Not an unenjoyable game, but clearly overhyped with an odd game design philosophy, if there was any.

Now played almost 10 times. I admit I had to rewrite my comment once again. Good component, although the Nazgul are among the worst pawns ever made in a game: they keep falling on their left side. Bad basic rules, good advanced rules. I don't like both the dice system and the fact that all the units are equal in power and movement. 
Basically a good boardgame, but IMHO not a strategic game at all. I maybe expected too much. Try it before you buy it. A mention I want to do for the customer service, directely from the game's author that are really helpful and kind! Thanks!

The is an excellent creation that combines the tactical elements of a wargame with the mechanics that almost force the game to play out along Tolkin's basic plot for the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  My only concern with not rating this higher is that I start to wonder about the replayability of this one with it being sooo structured.  Update: after a number of playings, I've updated my rating from a 7 to a 7.5  I've actually purchased a copy of this for myself, which I'd doubted that I would ever do...

A superbe job on capturing one of fiction's greatest narratives in a compelling and (usually) tense game. If you are into LotR, buy this. Knocks against it, however, are: a large and necessary FAQ, little to no "fog of war", and a sad reliance on d6 for combat (and all the known foibles that entails). If the designers had only managed to break the d6 bond and reached for a truly balanced and strategic combat system, the game would be a 10 hands down. Rocks as a 2-player game; not quite so good with 3 or 4. Sure it's long. So are the books and film. Get over it!

I enjoy every round of this game. A very immersive two player game (there are rules for 3 or 4 players but it IS a two player game).

I still like the first edition even though a second one has come out. First edition has some flaws and I would have rated it around 8 if it wasn't for the expansion (Battles of the Third Age) which really smoothes out balancing issues.

This will be my next buy. I played this game for the first time somemonths ago, and I was surprised with the fidelity this game describes the J.R.R. Tolkien stories about the Lords of the Rings..

Finally played the game.  Though first game is long - due to learning, teaching and reading the cards.. it was a lot of fun.  Specially playing with soundtrack from the movies.  The Shadow lost when the Fellowship managed to get to Mount Doom.  A lot was also due to failed Hunt of the Ring rolls by the Shadow.  Can't wait to play this game again.  Definitely more fun than any other Big Box Wargame (A&A, Risk, etc.) I've played.

i don't deeply mind complexity, but i have to get something in return for it.  in this game i feel like i got high chrome and high thought complexity, without actually receiving high chrome or being given lots of meaningful choices.  the sauron player seems much more fun to play, but it was annoying that i didn't seem to have control over corruption.  the multiple paths to victory also seemed to be a ruse, with each side having a preferred method.  i actually walked away from this game wondering what the lord of the rings risk game is like, because it might be better.  i'd still try it again sometime, but it doesn't initially seem to be worth the investment it takes to play it.

Unnecessarily verbose rules. Colossal amount of time to set up, made virtually impossible if you're not intimately familiar with middle earth's geography (even with the setup guides it takes a while, and not every nation referred to in the cards is in the lookup list in the rulebook). Gameplay mechanics are interesting -- variable action selection and variable hunt mechanism are quite clever and novel. Completely indistinguishable free people characters (yes, I know there are differences, no, I can't see them from three feet away), a horribly designed map (looks nice, difficult to read and play, not big enough for pieces, army replacement counters a hassle), and a preposterously verbose rulebook (which makes quick rules checks a lengthy process) make for an overall negative gaming experience for me. Not particularly interested in playing this one, not sure what all the fuss is about.

A fantasticly rich game experience.  The game is chock full of interesting game mechanics - Unique cards, dice and die mechanisms, etc.  The variety of elements in the game is incredible.  The fact that they all work in a balanced game experience is shocking.  The fact that it all comes together in capturing the theme and feel of the story but still allows the players to explore 'what ifs' is brillant.  Easily one of the best games out there.

A must for fellowship of the ring fanatics.

Rating after one play. One mistake that I made was that I was trying to keep everyone in the fellowship alive, so I didn’t hesitate to give Frodo additional damage/corruption. Correct procedure would have been to let some of those pesky hobbits go.

One note on this. My friend who I play with has actually done a lot of modification of the game, replacing the regular and elite units with cubes and disks. I found that for a new player this made the game much easier to see at a glance.

Great integration of theme with gameplay.  However, the game can be a tad fiddly and would be better served with smaller separately colored symbolic bits (or counters) than provided miniatures.  Dealing with the minis DOES detract from the game due to fiddliness and information clarity issues.  The gameplay itself feels like a lot of in-theme stuff (the cards, etc) thrown in and very thoroughly playtested into balance.

I love how this game oozes with the LotR theme. I love the minis, the cards, and the game art. Frankly, everything component-wise is top notch.

The rulebook is a little crappy for such a relatively simple game - if the game isn't just explained to you, it can be quite daunting to learn.

The gameplay itself is VERY fun, but in all honesty is just a bit too luck based for my liking. The end of the game is basically dictated by whether or not you draw an eye tile - and when that happens the fellowship takes a pretty massive hit of corruption. This has caused the free peoples to lose in both games I've played. [[edit: I'm told that this is because I'm not stacking my hunt tiles properly. I'll try weighting it a bit more.]]

I do absolutely love the idea of the free peoples being limited in the number of components provided, while the shadow armies are unlimited. That adds an interesting dynamic.

RATING: 7
Great pieces.  Board reminiscent of METW.  Nice feel to the game and good connections to the book, lots of good idea - corruption points, etc.  Some graphics too good and need some getting used to.  Won my first game as Free People capturing Mount Gundabad and Umbar for a military (as opposed to ring based victory) and close to capturing Moria also.  I was left with the feeling that the game was biased in favour of the Free Peoples and that the Shadow Armies would have a difficult time winning, hence my rating.  Keen to play again to hopefully disprove my theory and up my rating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Heavy, like all wargames are. The theme works well here. The Shadow player has obviously more army power, so the Free People Player must rush and take the ring to mordor if wants any chance in winning.
Takes quite some time to play. 
I don't like the fact that the figures are too much alike, they aren't very distinguishable - finaly I'm getting my minis painted so let's see if it hits the table soon.

Played full game once (and one simple quickstart game).  I enjoyed the game and will play it again;  the command dice roll allows a wide variety of choices yet still controls the game a bit to prevent it from being too open.

So I've played it now.
I hate it.  I feel the need to let EVERYONE know how much this game sucks.

I was going to review this game, but every time I sit down to do it, I get "flashbacks" and have to wait out the horror of reliving the game.  I may do it sometime, but not in the near future.  The game is that traumatizing.  I do want to add, though, that someone was kind enough to take it off my hands.

Még egyetlen játékra sem készültem ennyit, mint a Gyűrűk háborújára. Hetekig tartott, mire magyarítva elkészültek a kártyák, és a szabályt is elég nehéz volt összeszedni, az eredeti nagyon kusza. Szerintem a hagyományos módon (egyszer elolvasom a szabályt, és utána azonnal mehet a játék) teljesen esélytelen kipróblni. Több hetes rákészülés után végre tegnap kipróbáltuk a két személyes változatot, és felemás a tapasztalatom. Egyfelől nagyon egyedi a játékmenet, tetszik, ahogy megoldották a gyűrűhordozók bujkálását, és a romlottságukat. Tetszik az is, hogy mindkét fél 2 teljesen eltérő módon is nyerhet(katonailag, és a gyűrűn keresztül). De ahogy a rákészülés, úgy maga a játék is baromi időigényes. A felpakolás így kezdőként 1 óra volt, de egy haladónak is legalább fél óra lehet. Ha új emberrel játsszuk, a szabály ismertetés alsó hangon 1 óra. És maga a játék... nos a hivatalos 3 órával szemben, nagyon nehezen tudom elképzelni, hogy 5-6 órán belül vége legyen. Néhány órán belül odáig sem jut el a játék, hogy a nemzetek többsége hadba lépjen. Egy szó, mint száz, nagyon jó játék, de elrontja az élményt az, hogy külön életmódot igényel a rákészülés, és szabadságot kell kivenni, ha játszani akarunk vele. És még ezzel együtt is szeretnék újra játszani vele:)

Fontos még, hogy nem pont ugyanaz a katonák elosztása, mint a leírásban. Az össz darabszám stimmel, de jópár nemzet seregében +-1 katona van.
A másik, hogy a Szabad Népek játékos dobókockáin 2 oldal ugyanaz, pedig a leírás szerint 6 különböző oldala van. De minden akcióra lehetőség van így is, csak más eséllyel. A mi játékunkban pl. ezáltal felértékelődött a Gyűrűhordozók menekülésének lehetősége. Azért ez elég durva hiba, ha teljes szériában kiment így. De nyomozok még, hátha én értettem valamit félre:)
---
A második játék már jobban sikerült, és rövidebb is volt jóval: 3 órás partit játszottunk. A mostani tapasztalat az, hogy a Szabad Népek játékos szinte esélytelen. De még próbálkozunk majd:) Talán katonailag nyerhet az a fél is.
---
5 év elteltével újra játszottam, immár a 2. kiadással, és el kell ismernem, hogy nagyon egyedi és hangulatilag nagyon erős a játék. Visszamenőleg megbocsátom ennek az 1.0 verziónak is azt a néhány apró hibáját, és felpontozom. Vicces lenne, ha 2 pont különbséggel pontoznám az egyébként szinte tökéletesen megegyező játékokat.

THE GOOD
I really love this game because of the event cards and the action dice. They are different every time, and though there is a finite number of cards, there is an almost limitless number of ways in which they will be drawn. It is almost as if each game is a rewriting of the book, chapter by chapter, paragraph by paragraph.

The balance of military action versus character maneuver also makes this game great. Players must always be ready to change tactics and must never rely on one course of action throughout a game. Tunnel vision quickly leads to defeat.

THE BAD
The rules are a bit fiddly and not written intuitively - it is practically impossible to find a certain rule in the book in a timely manner. Facts and figures are hidden in large blocks of rambling words, so that finding the answer to any particular question is like looking for a 3000-year lost ring in Middle-earth.

THE UGLY
I'm going blind with the small print.Argh.

Once you get past the excruciatingly long set up (why are 2 player games always the most complex?), this is a very good, albeit long, game.

It does use dice to resolve combat, but each player can use cards to alter dice or add additional effects.

A game for people who play a lot of games, not that there's anything wrong with that, since I'm one myself.  Beautiful pieces, lovely map, quick play, tense endings are all good.

Originally a 9, but quickly slipped to 7 when the DEW strategy was independantly discovered in one of our games.(effectively making the game a very one-sided afair in Sauron's favour.)  

Deserves a better rating considering the uniqueness in gameplay and the colour & thematic elements.  It also has a number of different strategies that can be attempted.

Might be able to re-evaluate the game after trying some of the variants designed to make the game a fairer contest.

I prefer to play Knizia's Lord of the Rings.  The emphasis in that game is more on the Hobbits rather than the large scale battles of WotR.  However, I did enjoy my first play of War of the Ring as the Shadow forces.

The action dice are both a strength and a weakness of the game design.  I'm a player that likes to have more control over my actions.  Fortunately I rolled an even distribution of actions so I was able to muster and move armies on a regular basis.

This follows the story very well, the board and the figures are gorgeous. Unfortunately it's way too long (6+ hours with 4 players!) and fiddly (stacking pieces below the figures and there is still not enough space on the board). Too much luck (card draws and dice) for a game with this complexity.

Update: Now an owner of the 2d edition, the only issue remaining is an option for cardboard chits rather than miniatures, but that's a minor point. The new cards are much better, and even help your determine priority when there are conflicts. I love this game!

[1st Ed] I have played this beauty of a game over 70 times now and I still get immense satisfaction from playing competitive opponents. There are lots of things to love about this game but a few things have increasingly annoyed me:
1. I dislike the stupid, childish miniatures! Just give me nicely drawn cardboard chits.
2. It gets harder to read those cards.
3. We need an official master rule book with all the FAQs already answered. Its gets tiring looking in various places to get answers, and every game I have to look something up. I've decided to lower my rating because the rules are difficult to understand.
4. I am definitely not a fan of FFG style games.

Got this last year with some Christmas money, and finally got around to learning how to play it.  Wow!  I can now understand the buzz that surrounds this game.  I feel I'm still in the learning phase with this title, but the different game nuances this affords is creative, strategic, and enjoyable.  I was a little leery about buying a game that has the same standard goal each play, but have come to realize that the randomness of cards, the dice rolls, and the opponent's strategies definitely up the level of replayability.  I look forward to playing this again and again.  It doesn't hurt that I love the Tolkien stories.  [Christmas gift]

I'm impressed. Rating after playing only one game. Took 5 hours to finish and the result was unknown until the very last die roll. The dark force had it's 10th victory point one turn before the ring could have been destroyed. 
Lots of flair. Best game on the subject. Longer but so much deeper than the Confrontation game.
A real strategic wargame, with political elements, heroic interventions and very close to the book. Makes you read about the subject. Best strategic fantasy wargame I played.

Beautiful and beautifully crafted game. All master Tolkien's fans will love it, as will anyone who likes boardgames.(Just Tolkien's fans maybe even more).

Looks nice, but that's the only +. It's an experience(like going to a movie and see what will happen, passively), not a game (like steering the events by decisions actively). There are no decisions to be made during the whole game as the free people. Luck can not be mitigated at all. Most of the map is there for no reason other than being mentioned in the books and inflating size and price of a bad game.

Does an admirable job on balance though playing as the Fellowship is a lot more nerve-wracking. Gotta keep those hobbits moving even with lots of nasty Nazgul running around. Definitely a game where people need to read the rules (several times) before trying to play.

After second game it was still very nice to see the painted figures in action. Now have played both Shadow and free people and I'm struggling to see how the FP can achieve victory by destroying the ring if Shadow have half a tactical brain.(5 plays down and the FP have got 2 away from thwe crack of doom once).

Dice play a bigger part than I usually like but this game seems to carry off the rub of the luck with rolls potentially propped up by cards being used. A wide number of strategies and options I'd like to play more of this.

Rating may go up after more plays. Lots of rules for a first timer to grasp right away. Text on the cards is very small and the pieces seem too large for the map. The armies also should be painted to help differentiate them. Overall, an interesting game. 

Update:I tried it again, and for how much I like LOR, I just don't get into this game, although I really want to. It leaves me thinking about what else I could have played during the time it took to play it. Seems overly long for the mission of the game. I'm shocked that I don't like it, but I have to face facts and admit, I really don't.

There really isn't enough that you can say about this game. It is different every time you play it, it is not luck dependant, you always feel like you are "in" it, and the theme is not only good, it is perfectly suited. Lots went into this game and you can get lots out.

I got to play this the other day and well, it's beautiful, but it's far too much investment for what one reviewer said and I agree, "Finally (finally!) let me mention the Event Cards. Without Event Cards, the game would really just be Risk with a few recognizable characters thrown in and a time limit."  Which is what I felt like I was playing except those "event" cards eluded to above seem to be wildly unbalanced.  This is NOT worth the hype. If you are a "dyed-in-the-wool" Rings fan, you'll probably love it to death.  I still can't figure out why have all those lovely different miniatures when all the armies are generic.  The map is pretty, but almost useless as a gaming tool.  Again, we get lots of cashing in on the latest movie theme, but at least it was an effort, unlike lots of the garbage that gets produced after a big motion picture.  I could be convinced to try it again, but I'm not eagerly awaiting the coming of the Fellowship.

The only thing that stops this from being a 9 is the fact that it really strikes me as a 2-player game only, and it simply lasts too long!  The 3- and 4-player versions seem quite tacked-on.  However, as a 2-player event game, this is fantastic!  Very engaging, entertaining, and enjoyable.  My wife and I heartily endorse this one!  Probably not for serious grognards whose ego is tied up in their win/loss ratio.  So cinematic!

WotR takes awhile to learn, and really needs two players who are familiar with the game, the cards, and the general flow of the turns.  Once you have that though, wow.  So many choices and options, and the various aspects of the game (politics, mustering, leaders, etc.) are quite clever and fun.

After many more games with players who are familiar with the game, this has become one of the gems of my collection.  Every game is different, every game is intensely interesting, and every game is a treat.

An excellent game that recreats Tolkien's world. When you play WotR you truly feel the Middle Eath, and I suppose this was the aim of the authors: excellent work!!

I knew the game from playtesting and loved the gameplay, now that I had a chance to see the actual components, and they match the quality of the design, I think that the perfect score is well deserved (except maybe the lobster orcs, but this is really trivial in comparison to the quality of the figures!)

I think this is an excellent game.  Generally 'theme-based' games often skimp on quality.  Here, the game 'felt' that it represented the military capabilities of the factions from Lord of the Rings in a logical manner, yet still the game is balanced.  

From a strategy standpoint, skill is rewarded, I was surprised at how my son (with a little experience) domianned me in an apparently simple looking game.  The game can be tense and interesting.

My biggest negative is that set-up time is fairly long for a realtively quick game,

See my comment for "LOTR: The Confrontation" about my handicap with this theme.

We finallly set it up and slugged through a few turns (that much took over 2 hours). Husband as the Free Peoples, me as the Shadow. I suspect it was pretty agonizing for him, but he patiently worked me through the rules and by the end of our "trial" I was starting to get the hang of it, including some strategy. I'll take the big rulebook to bed for a few nights, and maybe I'll be ready for a full game soon.

We did find that the minatures of the same colour are very difficult to tell apart at a glance (i.e.: the Northerners vs. Rohan vs. Gondor vs. Elves), but maybe that comes with time. Or time plus a considerable amount of model paint. Oh, and the Nazgul are badly balanced, they keep toppling over onto their soldiers. That's only funny the first three times.

A towering achievement! Truly innovative game engine which uses action dice and cards to drive the game play. All the elements combine to lead the players to follow the story arc of the books, yet there is always the delicious tension of having to manage your dice/cards/units to accomplish what you know you have to do.

Two games in one: an operational level war game alongside a character game that both sides must focus on to be successful. Within the story arc you can choose various strategies and tactics ensuring ample replayablity. Only a few niggling minor gripes prevent this from being a perfect "ten."

Great game for LoTR fans, if you want a quick game play Lord of the Rings - The Confrontation (2002). For an excellent 4 hour LoTR wargaming experience, look no further. Bags of replay value as the starting cards have a big impact on your strategy and it will take a number of playings to explore the strategic possibilites of each side. 4 player has a significantly different feel, meaning I want to play both 2 player and 4 player. 3 player doesn't seem so good though. Unfortunately everyone I play this with has now burnt out on it - the main complaint is the 'mordor track', I don't have such a problem with it, but the end result is it's not getting played anymore, hence I've knocked it down first from a 10 to 9 then 8 and now to 7 as I've given up suggesting it and  it's not getting played :(

There seems to be a *lot* of substance to this game.  So far I lost as the Free Peoples and am eager for more.  Since my opponent and I were both first time players we felt a bit over-whelmed by the rules but we felt it was important to muddle through and get a game in.  Of the 2 sides I think the forcers of darkness are easier to grasp but an experienced Free Peoples player can make this game a tight race for victory.  I look forward to the next match.

I like the use of dice as it give the game a random course of events.

Very, very solid.  One of the best games in my collection.  Always seems to be a tense finish, provides for lots of analysis afterwards, absolutely steeped in theme.  Always has me wanting to play again as soon as I'm finished.

Own card upgrade kit, Battles of 3rd Age & Lords of ME exp.

My one play was an introductory affair that got us 2 turns in.  I really want to play this fully and will rate the game after having done so.

Second game went 4 turns, so things are improving!

RATING: 8
You are immersed into Middle Earth, with great event card and action dice elements offering a nice range of options. Brilliant weaving of the Fellowship movement with the character involvement and the epochal battle for Middle Earth. Each turn tough decisions need to be made, progress must be achieved, and the unexpected can happen. Though dice and cards are integral to the game system, luck should not determine your success, despite opinions of some players. Unfortunately, length has lessened the number of plays (3 hours). Learned a great deal while playtesting the second edition for the Italian designers.

Traded inadvertently in a math trade where I entered information incorrectly, but my oversight. Someone got a great deal. Bought second edition to compensate.

I was an early playtester but my schedule didn't permit me to spend the time, but I kept up with all the playtest discussions.  This is a classic example of "mission creep" where slight problems with game balance were addressed by added rules.  Eventually, what was orginally a very streamlined design became hopelessly bloated with unnecessary, complicated, time-consuming elements.  It's a shame.  I wish I still had the original playtest file, because I would do a print/play version of the original game before the playtests ruined it - it was balanced, quick, and FUN!

This is a great example of what happens when you don't try to streamline a game's design at all. There are so many special situations and subsets of rules that it's  impossible to learn it all on the first time you play it. Overall, it seems meant more as a Lord of the Rings simulator, and less as a game. Traded mine away after one "play" (4 hours of rules reading and setup, then about an hour of play, then we quit).

Awesome!  Can't wait to play. Played the basic game a couple of times years and years ago, enjoyed it, but now I own it I am looking forward to getting stuck into the main game.

Update: Played the main game.  Love it.  People who love Lord of the Rings should find this a blast.  Much to think about and much to do, many options means many potentia,l strategies to pursue.  I am really impressed with this and am very glad to own it.  Playing the game is time consuming, look at it as an Event.  Wonderful game that actually plays very simply.

Look for some of the player aids here on BGG, they are truly excellent and very very useful!

Update:  Having played some of the other 'big name' games with this theme, I feel that War of the Ring is quite simply THE definitive Lord of the Rings game.  The other games are nice - especially so because they carry the theme of these wonderful books, but War of the Ring is a sweeping narrative in the style and with the scope of the trilogy.  A masterful game.

With one playing I don't know if there's a lot of variability in the strategy or if the game is unbalanced but what I can tell you is that this game is the modern equivalent of what Axis&Allies was in the '80s - very cool and lots of fun!  My friend replaced a lot of the army pieces with some very basic (Supremacy?) pieces so I didn't have the difficulty of trying to tell the different pieces apart which would have been irritating. In all, a very fun game that if you love the theme or lighter wargames in the A&A mode it's worth it for you to try.

Very nice wargame with a lot of tactical decisions to make.  Models the feeling of the books surprisingly well.  Seems somewhat scripted, and the randomness of the action dice can be very frustrating and screw up your well-laid plans (especially as the Free Peoples player).  It is a long game (4+ hours) which limits how often it will get played.

RATING: 6.5
UPDATE: Played this again recently, and I'm to break all my rules and give it a 6.5. Usually, on my rating scale, a '7' is a game that is probably a keeper if it offers something interesting and different, while a '6' rating essentially guarantees the game will be sold. War of the Ring seems like the absolutely perfect bubble game. I want it and its huge box out of my house to make room for better games, and yet when it comes to selling it, I can never quite pull the trigger, and when I play it, I have just barely enough fun to still not be able to make up my mind on what to do. So I keep it. But I'm not thrilled about it. So much stress for such an average game. If it weren't Tolkien, it would be gone.
---
Overall, disappointing. War of the Ring was on an odd power curve for me. First game was disappointing, as the use of theme here is not very imaginative - this is Risk with a War of the Ring veneer. It's a pretty good veneer, it should be said, but it really hasn't grasped the theme fundamentally the way Knizia's Lord of the Rings did. But the next couple plays were fun, the dice add some excitement, the game is visually appealing, and it's familiar enough via its Risk heritage to be accessible.

Where the game got killed for me, though, was in the repeat draw. War of the Ring as only one really valid path for the Fellowship player: race the Fellowship as fast as possible. This then badly constrains the Shadow Player's options - you can't seriously hunt for the ring, it's all about getting the military victory conditions as fast as possible. This then degenerates into a game that isn't about judging your opponents, adapting, or other elements of real strategy, strategy elements that a game this long really has to have - the strategies are pretty much set - but about hyper-technical tactical details and analysis. For me, this is OK, but not something I can really get into, and certainly is not very thematic.

At the end of the day, the game is just too expensive for the limited replay value for me. Unless you're going to get really excited by the minute tactical details of this one, probably something to play on a friend's copy.

I think War of the Ring fell over in two critical ways. Firstly, as mentioned, the theme simply isn't grasped firmly eough. Secondly, though, is the action dice. They are a fairly clever as a concept, but when viewed in a holistic way, I think they are ineffective. They serve to constrain rather than enable. You have an idea what you want to do, but you are constrained by what the dice allow you to do. Certain combinations of dice don't suddenly open up options that weren't available before, although many combinations will prevent you from doing what you want. If they enabled uncertainty or an ability to bluff, that might be something - but they don't, all dice rolls are open and can be seen by everyone, so your opponent knows exactly when you have a crappy roll and how to hammer you for it. The Fellowship knows how dangerous it is to move, and can calculate the odds exactly, which seems quite wrong.

Obviously, I'm not exactly enamored of the game, but I actually liked the 3-player version better than the 2-player. This version adds more constraints on how you can play (usually not a good thing), but by not allowing the FP player to take consecutive actions with the same nation, it seems to weaken Gondor and Rohan enough to make the game a little more interesting. By contrast, the SP doesn't seem to suffer much from the new restrictions, and they benefit a little bit with the added card-drawing freedom.

Addenda: whoever the graphic design person was on this, I certainly hope he or she never works again in the game industry. The number of serious usability issues is absolutely mind-blowing, from areas so small they are unusable despite vast areas of empty and wasted space, impossible-to-distinguish-or-even-see towns/cities/fortifications, indisinguishable Free People sculpts, invisible terrain and boder symbols, to tiny and meaningless iconography, and miniscule font sizes. The game *looks* good, so I'm not sure how significant this will be to most people, but the actual design is exceptionally poor.

I'm rating this so highly because the mechanisms, while a bit strange, seem to integrate so well with the theme.  Secondly, it's just so ridiculously fun to play.  Especially with the strategic expansion, I consider this to be a real gem in my current collection.  Very glad to have painted the figures, etc. It took me weeks of FAQ study etc. to fully grok the rules.  The game can be a non-starter with bad cards and/or bad dice (action or combat), but thankfully it doesn't take too long to finish up if things go completely south on you.  Reducing rating because of the direction taken with 2nd edition, in particular the opportunity lost to upgrade cards for 1st edition + 1st expansion.  Would have really liked to have more readable and more correct cards.

I really like this one. Very clever adaptation of Tolkien's work. And I don't think the rush to Mount Doom thingie some people bring up is a problem. I've often enough put my best efforts into that only to be corrupted in Mordor... Lots of facets to this one. That said, it's not a game I'd take to a desert island. But it doesn't have to be a game I love.

Good attempt at recreating the epic novels. Good quality components apart from the wonky Nazgul and the miniscule font size used on the cards (1st edition). The new cards are a must.Also the rules are very poorly organised (an FFG trait). To win as Sauron by completing the corruption track seems almost impossible so the strategy of trying to quickly overwhelm the closest towns and fortresses becomes quite repetitive. The board becomes very crowded in the centre whilst virtually nothing happens around the edges.

I know this will not be popular with the super fans of this game, but I didn't really like this game. I love the Lord of the rings. I love all things fantasy, but this game suffers from two problems. One is that it is too long. This could be overcome if I liked the game more. Its second problem is the fact that it is a simulation. I feel like it is 3+ hour reenactment of the movie. After a few plays, I didn't want to play anymore. Then you have the luck of the draw at the end of the game on the track to mordor. Very anti-climatic.  sold my copy and don't forsee playing it again anytime soon. I've had my fix and don't need anymore.

Oh, please help me!  What did I get myself into by purchasing (trading for) this game?  I am actually frightened by it for some reason.  When I bought [gameid=22825], I played two full games by myself (alternating sides) to learn the rules and get a flow for the game.  I have yet to do the same for WotR because for some reason it scares me.

And gosh, I wish that FFG would have found a better way to distinguish the different Free Peoples armies - the spears of the Northmen look identical to those of Rohan, which look like the Spears of Gondor!  Argh!!!  And they are all the same color of blue!  The Elite mounted FP units suffer the same unidentifiable characteristics.  NOw I have to crank out old paint just to add some color-differentiations so that I can tell everything apart.

Maybe I am afraid of this game because I need to PAINT the minis first just so that I can tell the units apart from each other!

My rating is based on playing the super awesome, extremely expensive, special edition that comes in a box that looks like a book.  MAN, is it beautiful.  I finally got the chance to play this one and even though it is pretty to behold, the game was tight and fun too!  The two-pronged approach of military vs ring/corruption victories definately gives each player a balancing act to perform.  The decisions, and there are plenty of them, are not easy and the pressure is felt by the opposing player's actions.  

After my first play, I really want to play a copule more times to get through the 'learning' phase as this could be one of my favorites.

-update: One of my favorites.  I always think about it and how every game has its own feel, which is a real feat.  I don't think a game so tightly woven around theme will ever be this good again.

If you're a fan of Lord of the Rings, this is a game for you. It simulates the plot of the book, but it's an open simulation, so you can change the course of events. You can command armies of middlearth and guide, or seek to destroy, the fellowship in its mission to Mordor. Very big board with beautiful map of Middlearth and lots of plastic pieces representing various army units make this game even better. On the other hand this game sometimes seems to random. After a wictory you may feel that you won because you had luck, not because you commanded so well.

Hugely thematic, but still allows you to change the way the story plays out so the game is not scripted.  Knowledge of the cards is a must from the standpoint that you need to know what's going to come up so you can prepare, and you need to be aware of how your opponent (especially if they're the Shadow) can kick your butt with a single card play.  

Dice mechanic is cool, but you can still mitigate a bad roll.  The hunt mechanic is brutal.  You want to move the fellowship forward but you'll have to sacrifice somebody.  ouch.

RATING: 10
Wow.  Right now there's no game I'm more consumed with.  This is by far my favorite wargame of all time.  Combines elements of a fantasy adventure sub-plot within a well architected wargame.  Rules can be tough to crack.  I would suggest playing the introductory game a few times, per the suggestion in the rules.  My one gripe is that I really wish the units had been colored differently.  Common sentiment.  Be prepared for a time investment, but it's worth it.

UPDATE:  I have played it nine times now, and it still holds at a 10.  A further gripe, though, is that the rules are tricky to learn.  I would recommend looking through the FAQs, etc, as there are lots of rules that are non-obvious but which affect gameplay out greatly for one side or the other.  Remember that if a character dies (which can never happen if they're alone in a region), you lose the character dice associated with them.  For instance, for Gandalf, Aragorn, Witch King, etc.  If the Fellowship gets revealed, they can't end movement in a settlement.  Also, the game isn't over until the end of the turn for military victories, so it's possible to lose ground, then gain it back before you will lose the game.

RATING: 5
[i]For what it's worth as context, I am not a huge Tolkien fan; I think The Hobbit is a pretty good kids' story, I find LOTR entertaining as literary comfort food once I give myself permission to ruthlessly skip ahead when the prose starts turning an especially deep shade of purple or, worse, when somebody starts threatening to break out into [b]another fucking song[/b], and I can't imagine any non-gunpoint context under which I would read the Silmarillion.[/i]

So.

Neither the total catastrophe I feared nor the miracle I had faint forlorn hope of it being. War of the Ring is a decent, playable-in-a-longish evening (we started the setup and rules explanations a little after five and were done a little after nine) dudes-on-a-map game. There's a lot of dice chucking, which some people object to, which is a mystery to me -- surely the game would be more random if there were only a few die rolls that were considerably more decisive?

Likewise, the rolling of a fistful of dice every turn, which some people can't seem to get past, was OK by me; it gave each turn a little shape right from the start, and gave you a partial preview of what your opponent was likely to do, thus informing your in-turn tactics a bit without making the whole experience run on rails. (I found the dice pool of available actions to be less restrictive to play than the orders cards in Combat Commander, with the caveat that CC's order cards are a hell of a lot more thematically justified.)

I [i]do[/i] think that some sort of gamey simultaneous action selection system a la Race For The Galaxy might be more interesting than just dicing for the available actions, but the game does provide you with enough outs that you'll very rarely be in a position where you cannot at all move an army that absolutely must be moved.

Combat is more buckets o' dice; it felt comfortingly familiar to me as a Here I Stand player, really, and it works fine.

I enjoyed the hunt for the Ring/moving the Fellowship subgame; it gives both sides another dimension to worry about besides what's happening on the board plus it seems like it's pretty much the only plausible winning scenario for the Free People in most games. Mechanically, I don't have any great objections to any aspect of the game, in the final analysis, and I would prefer this to the old Milton Bradley Gamesmaster games, which are more or less this game's peers, complexity- and mechanics-wise.

My lack of enthusiasm for the game stems less from something wrong with the way it's put together than from a lack of interest, both in this style of game in general (strategy-light dudes on a map), and with the source material, plus, strange as it is to say this about a game that drizzles fancy components in the box like Rachel Ray drizzles olive oil on a roasting chicken, a pretty searing general dislike/annoyance with the components.

The board is as large a mounted map as you'll ever encounter and yet far too small for all the bits likely to be put into key spaces like Minas Tirith, the spaces on the board do not obviously display at a glance whether they contain a town vs. a city vs. a fortification (and none of the information about a space is legible if there are troops there (and there are ALWAYS troops on pretty much any space that matters) the cards can be difficult to read, the dice (while admittedly lovely bits of pseudo-marble shiny) have unintuitive squiggly symbols on them that are hard to read across a table, the hero figures for each side are indistinguishable from one another without consulting a key, the political tokens are likewise virtually indistinguishable without a long look and a cross-check against a interpretive guide, and, worst of all, the Dudes on this particular map are all red and blue and distinguished only by shape, this despite the fact that the particular faction within a given side that a unit belongs to is frequently critical information, information that that it is thus virtually impossible to get without detailed examination of individual pieces. Also my Nazgul kept toppling over dammit.

In short, everything about the graphic design of all the physical bits values a very narrow band of aesthetics over legibility and usability. I wouldn't harp on this for the better parts of two paragraphs if this wasn't a game specifically designed to look tantalizingly cool on the tabletop and if it wasn't priced accordingly. And all of this sexy cool designer porn is exactly orthagonal to the basic goal of usability.

And I throw out, perhaps churlishly, the data point that we players of historical wargames with our quotidian, color-coded, cardboard counters and our point-to-point maps have figured this stuff out a long time ago. Your funeral, 'trashers.

I've only played this once, so take my rating at that value, but for my value, this game seems like a fantasy version of Battle Cry or Memoir '44. I don't really enjoy the dice aspect of the game (which is surprising, considering how much I love Axis & Allies and it's ilk), but I like the in-depth nature of the wargame. My biggest concern (and the low score) is the difficulty of finding someone that's into board games enough to sit down and learn the game, who also has enough ability and time to play and enjoy it.

Christine does not like war games or anything that even resembles war games (for the most part) let alone a game that has war in the title.  Nor does she really like games that are derived from books because they usually thinly slap on a theme and run with it.  However, Christine really does like this game and managed to win by a corruption victory.  The best thing was that Ross really enjoyed the game too, even though he lost (ha ha! Christine beat Ross at a war game!).  A good game overall.  The theme fits the game.

This game can be a very frustrating experience.  There is a lot of luck involved.  Even though it is all about risk management, you can still feel like your best laid plans are completely ruined.

Still love this game, even if I stink at it!

This game is a must for all fans of the War of the Ring saga. You just play through the whole adventure and on the board the war plays out at the same time as the fellowship tries to get the ring to Mount Doom and Sauron desperately tries to catch up with them with the help of his ringwraiths.
The fellowship might want to split up to get important characters to be able to help out in the war while the ringwraiths tries to do the same.

Finally, after five years of owning, I played War of the Ring.  It was awesome, a brutal seven hour adventure that left me mentally and physically drained.  We took a long lunch break, but still, I was exhausted but enjoying every bit of it.  This is what a Lord of the Rings game should be. 

Great look, great gameplay.  Very Fiddly, lots of little rules and chrome, but still, it wouldn't be near as good if it were only the intro-rules gameplay.

It takes a while to set up, but it sure looks nice when it is (I painted my set a while ago). The fixed starting positions can lead to some rote opening moves, but I have yet to experience this as I don't play it enough to have any sort of standard strategy.

Surprisingly enough what with the word "war" in its title and all, this is not a wargame. It's a strategic game of adventure and conquering with plenty of clever game mechanics to go around and keep every player on his or her toes, whether it be the Free People or the Shadow. Has a great feeling to it and beautiful artwork.

Initially I thought this game was too hard for the fellowship to win but since playing a few more games I think it can easily go either way. It is an absolutely faithful reproduction of the canonical possibilities of the Trilogy withsuperb production. One thing that might frustrate some is that the wargame component, which takes up much of the time in the game plays a subsidiary role to the quest and hunt for the ring but this is as it should be. However some of my opponents still preferred the old SPI game.

RATING: 6
This is a war game that feels a lot like Risk or Axis and Allies except there are multiple victory conditions and a distinct unbalance in forces that really raises the tension in the game. The use of the LoTR theme is fantastic. One player takes the Shadow Armies and the other player takes the Free Peoples. It is the free peoples job to survive long enough to get the ring bearers to mount doom (or possibly to take two of Sauron's strongholds... more on that later). The game starts with a ton of pieces on the board. The miniatures are fairly well detailed and fun to play with, but I was a bit disappointed in how bent up they came out of the box. Also, they don't fit on the board especially well.

During play, players roll dice to see what actions are available to them in any given round. Depending on what actions they take, there is also dice rolling involved for attacking, defending, and hunting for the ring bearers. The dice rolls usually require a 1/3 or 1/6 chance of success, but can get more favorable if the free peoples try to move the ring too fast.

It is the dice rolling that is the ultimate failure for this game for me. Sure, they add an element of luck and fun for a gamer who wants a less hardcore experience, but they also mean that the players turn a great deal of their destiny over to random chance. Depending on how the dice roll up, either side can score an easy victory quickly. For my part, I am left with a bitter taste in my mouth and the feeling that whatever I did the dice squashed.

If you like Risk and don't mind what the dice will do to you, this is a great game. If you like LoTR at all, this is a great game. If you want a deep strategic experience where you control your own destiny, this is not a great game. Try Agricola or Puerto Rico or something like that.

RATING: 8.5
I have questions about the replayability after some time.  But at first blush the game seems exceptionally balanced.  The components are very very nice and add wonderfully to the theme.  But this game is not all shiny bits....there is some substance under all that.  In the couple games I've played, War of the Rings builds a slow and steady crescendo of tension and drama.  The games can go either way and reward clever play.  There is a bit of luck, but I don't find it to be a large enough ingredient to distract from the richness of the game.  

We played one game where each side teetered on the edge of oblivion for about 3 turns and the Fellowship managed to destroy the ring at the last possible moment...and then just by the skin of their teeth. It literally couldn't have been closer. We got done, looked at each other and said, "Wow!"  That's what a game should be.

Indeed the best "Lord of the Rings" game to date, an instant classic!

Very good game, the best wargame since PoG. Rich in flavour. It solved the majority of the problems that plagued the other games on tLoR. Simple but elegant mechanism handle the ringbearer journey to Mount Doom. The combact sistem is pure Axis and Allies stuff, but you got enough event cards to bring it to Middle Earth. 
Be aware this one is a long game for german games standard (3-4 hours). We played in 4, and it's highly advised to do the same, but you don't have to speak to your buddy otherwise it becomes endless. The game is highly enjoyable in the 2 players version (and goes on more quickly as well).

Clever and unique movement mechanism for the fellowship.

This game is simply epic in every respect, and for once proves to be a game which lives up to all the pre-release hype surrounding it. It is tense exciting and different every time, and the feeling of play is very authentically "Tolkien". Components, cards and map are excellent and look beautiful on setup. Some of my figures were very bent (I bought 2 copies and both were the same), but this is easily remedied with the application of hot water and careful patient bending. (but see below) The figures themselves are remarkably detailed and well designed (though the large Nazgul are top heavy and WILL continually fall over in play - we found this entertaining, but it will frustrate others) In summary, I cannot imagine any game being produced to a better standard, and while no game is ever "perfect", this one is as close as you're ever likely to get. Buy it!  Update - reduced my rating to "9" because I found over time the figures "mended" with the hot water method above will sometines re-assert their original bent shape. Seems to be because of the "rubbery" type plastic used.

I'm finally playing it.After a horrendous wait of 14 months (!!) Why? one reason! The Manual. (Dutch Phalanx version, but I doubt it to be due to the translation) The rules of this game are written in the most awful & chtulian mind bending format imaginable! Too much for words! The format they adapt is a disaster for any organised mind! Everything is mixed up. They over elaborate so you totally lose track. And when you go looking for a part of the rules and (by luck) localise the title you re looking for, you have a 50% chance to find your answer. If not, you have to go look for the next title (identical but different lettering) for your answer and even then.. I say different lettering, but there is actually correspondence between chapters or parts and lettering. I hope this rulebook is easy for non gamers, but for me (the gamer person who usually reads the manual & then proceeds in teaching anybody else I play with) it was HELL! I'm used to reading a manual (sometimes twice) and then dive in! Needless to say I read this bitch trough once, ended up totally weirded out, cancel the first game (4 days after getting it) & then finally playing it Now; 14 months and 28 days after getting it!This 30 page rulebook have been 15 pages at most if for example the FF people would have had a go at it! *edit: And they actually DID make one :) Altough the size is about the same, the clarity is day and night! If only I had looked there earlier!* The only way to learn this is to find a friend & prepare to dig trough the rulebook as you play it. Taking about 2 hours for the first and second turn! Do yourself a favour and get some rule summaries / charts / .. player-aids! They ll do you A LOT of good!The 30 minutes of "preparing the board" are gruesome. This ll probably go quicker as we get a hang of it, but still.. its a whole lot of Rosie .. ehrm plastic to spread out over that Huge board!Enough gibberish, the game itself is Great! Rounds take about 15 minutes to complete and its kinda thrilling. I have the feeling the good guys don't really stand a chance, but then again.. that's authentic :) A well deserved 8 although I fear the average 6 hours (according to friends) will keep this one on the shelf more that it deserves!

THE Lord of the Rings game IMO with a great integration of theme. Also a very good asymmetric strategy / war game. Action dice and situational event cards mean a different story gets told every game. Successful integration of theme and tension usually lasts until the very end. Luck can be a factor, and many games could go either way based on the final tile pulls. Even better with painted miniatures.

War of the Ring is a great strategy game.

It represents incredibly well all the whereabouts of the geopolitic of The Middle Earth at the End of the Third Age.

This game is 20 times better than the Old SPI game (1977) wich was a good game in his time.

War of The Ring is much more interesting that it may look like at first glance.
Please refrain from hasty criticism, as one need many plays to understand the deepness of the game.

Quite good game to play with 4 players with a cooperative strategy within the teams(shared-victory home rule).

This game is really incredible.

A great mix of wargame and story-led activity that doesn't hold too close to the book. It will take a lot of time to get used to this, but I'm looking forward to every minute of it.

After only two plays, I wouldn't say it takes too long at all. Familiarity with the rules means we can storm through. As we get more savvy and start thinking properly through strategies, it will get longer, but all the more involving I'm sure.

One quibble: the cards are very powerful, so it seems odd that drawing them is so random.

RATING: 8
I greatly enjoy this game on two levels:

1. The game is a fun one. The initial position eliminates much of the "build up forces" time that makes some games take forever; the action-die mechanics are neat; there are interesting tactical and strategic decisions to make; there are many ways to try things.

2. It *feels* right, with the free peoples stalling for time, the fellowship fighting for every inch of ground, the overwhelming hordes of darkness inexorably tightening their grip, and it all riding (eventually) on a pair of hobbits. The mechanics support the atmosphere.

I have a few minor irritations (drawing useless action cards early or late in the game, etc.) but my only major complaint is that separating off a bunch of Companions to get involved with the military side of things - something that's both interesting for gameplay and reflects what happened in the books - tends to be a terrible strategy, as it both slows down the Fellowship (by using Character dice) and makes the ringbearer more vulnerable (by removing companions who could defend them).

I've only played with the expansion game once; it looks like it adds even more good stuff.

Lord of the Rings at its finest.  Controlling armies from all over Middle-Earth, all set during the time of the books themselves.  This is a gem.  The cards allow for much variation and surprises, and with some LOTR music on, this game really evokes the feel of the books.  One of the best games in my collection, and I'd never turn down a game.

Epic and great game - catches the atmosphere of LotR.

I must admit that it is just monster-fun for me to hunt those dirrrty hobbits with a horde of smart nazguuuul, hrch hrch.

This is an incredible game.  Every game turns into this great, unique, saga.  Highly replayable.  My current favorite game. 

Well, with the 2nd edition rules games just run too long so I've had to downgrade this.  Now it's just too long for what it is.  Very sad state of affairs really.

RATING: 8
In my book this is the definitive LOTR strategy game. It captures the essence of Tolkien's narrative without taking away from the player's freedom to determine the course of events. The gameplay is unique. It has enough depth to appeal to the more hardcore player, while being accessable to those who are interested in a fun, LOTR theme wargame.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I hate hype, which is partially why it took me 2 years to try this game. In fact, it's an excellent, extremely tight, thematic game with well integrated mechanics. WOTR works on a number of levels, adding a level of complexity uncommon to most Ameritrash (which, ultimately, is what it is). The Fellowship "mini-game within a game" is an extraordinary mechansim for adding a sense of tension to every decision, and also a convenient game timer (much, much better than the arbitrary end point after X-many turns in so many lesser games). Downsides are primarily that the game plays looong, especially when you're still learning (expect 6-8 hours, even after a couple of games), and a fairly dense rulebook (although not unreasonably so).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The "1's" here are simply foolish.  This is NOT a short game.  This is also not an easy game.  It is, on the other hand, exceptionally well-crafted, well-considered and prodoundly engaging.  It's one of the first games in a long while to make me think of it between plays.  I have yet, however, to bring in a 2-player session in below 4 hours.  It is also, however, IMHO, NOT suited to multi-play.  The 3 &4 player versions really do seem a bit tacked-on.

The production quality is great.  I liked the turn sequence and the general play of the game.  The rules, however, got in the way more than they should have.
The battles were pretty fun.  They played well, and the battle cards really kept things fresh.  
After one play there are definitely things i would have done differently.  That is usually something that peaks my interest in a game,  but not so much this time.  The level of rule complexity would limit me too much in finding someone to play this game with.   I would be interested to see how i could improve on first effort, but the game is so unbalanced that it works against my motivation to do so.

300 fanboyz can't be wrong, can they?  ;)  I've played once and I'd give it a 7.  The pacing is one of the major problems, as it's just really friggin' slow.  It's interesting how much LotR flavoring they packed into it, without making the game have a scripted feeling at all.  BUT, the game really forces the Sauron player to be very slow and plodding, and it was difficult to get the Free People's player's forces going...  That said, I will play again.

Just played my first game with the Standard Rules (with one earlier play with the Quick Start Rules). Awesome! This game deserves the praise it has received. Kept us on the edge of our seats to the very end. Mechanics work very well and are easy to master. The Free Peoples do appear to have to stick to the gameplan in the book - move the Fellowship first and foremost, while stoutly defending strongholds and making opportunistic spoiling attacks. The Shadow Army needs to militarily crush the Free Peoples as quickly as possible. Event Card play can swing momentum in a hurry. Great game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is quite an amazing game. Asymetric sides, dripping with theme, multiple ways to win, combat as well as hidden Fellowship. All the good stuff from the books is present in this game. Excellent concept and true to the story or the story's potential. It's great to play each side, as they play so differently from each other. I love the tension involved with the various aspects of the game, such as when to separate companions from the fellowship, when to use cards as an event or for combat advantages, and when and where to initiate an assault on the enemy cities/strongholds. Epic wargame level that takes a few games into it to become familiar with the rules and gameplay. Overall, great fun!

Absolutely the best thematic game I've ever played.

I would prefer wooden discs as units over the plastic figures, for playability.  There's a file created by a user here who made an excellent set of stickers for wooden discs.  Someday...

I was actually quite surprised at how this "heavy, complex" game ended up being much less difficult to learn and teach as I had thought (Do yourself a favor and watch "how to play" vids on YouTube), yet the gameplay allows for difficult decisions and strategies.  My decision to get this was motivated partially by wanting to get into the miniature painting hobby.  I recently began that mammoth undertaking, and am very glad that the game is one of my favorites to play as well!

RATING: N/A
Comments after 1st game: All I can say so far is I don't like the organization of the rules (no concise place that says what each action die's choices are, you have to dig through the rest of the rules to see that, "oh, I can do this with an X die".  Also, I hate that several of the nation's army types look so similar.  The bases need to be a different color if the shapes are so similar.  The map is pretty but barely functional, the national borders are hard to distinguish and finding regions is a pain, esp. those that aren't in the initial setup and thus numbered in the rules.  It took an hour just to set up and still we kept grabbing the wrong armies.  All that said, I think there is a fun game in here, maybe after we paint all the bases, write in the initial starting armies ON THE BOARD and download a bunch of rule rewrites we will be able to find it more easily.
Comments after 2nd game:  I still don't know how to rate this.  Setup was faster now that we had baggied everything.  The game started out well, we split it over two nights.  But, by night 2 and the hobbits approaching Mordor we began to think not all was well in Middle Earth.  What is the purpose of all those troops in the Mordor regions, the game isn't long enough for them to get anywhere and they can't actually hurt the fellowship because it fast-tracks to the Mountain as soon as it reaches the edge region.  The fellowship player really has to decide to either bee-line for Mt. Doom or go the military victory route, they won't have time to do both.  In our game, the Fellowship never moved more than a couple armies (and then it was in response to a Shadow whompin' down in Gondor / Rohan territory).  Once the fellowship made it to Mt. Doom I had to stop my military conquest to try to corrupt it to death, but that was all pretty random and didn't work.  He only drew one tile with a "stop" on it so got to the top pretty quickly.
As others have said, this is a better LOTR simulation than a game.  There are lots of fun aspects to the game but they don't fit together well at all.  I enjoy the card play and military aspects but the fellowship part just sucked the fun out.  I think I ought to try Queens Gambit based on the other negative comments, maybe it shares some of the good things and not so much of the bad.  And, I still think the rules are horribly organized and riddled with conflicts.

RATING: 8.5
A blast to play, this combines a light wargame with a Euro-like quest game in a package of awesome Tolkien flavor.  It'll take a few more plays to really determine how many of the strategies are obvious as opposed to being real choices, but the evidence points to there being enough of the latter to make this one a winner for the long term.  However, it won't appeal to Eurogamers who dislike light wargames unless they are LotR SuperFans.

The color scheme used for the pieces was a very, very bad idea.  It can be difficult to tell many of them apart.  Fine for those with the time and inclination to paint 'em all, but a hassle for the rest of us.

UPDATE: Wow, 5 years since my original review! Considering the amount of effort the game takes to play, the strategies are not quite as deep as they might be (it's mostly "how do I best make do with what I've rolled"), but it's so much fun to play that I've upped my rating a bit. This might be the most flavorful board game of all time.

RATING: 5
This game looks good and has some nice ideas such as the dice for actions mechanic, and is probably a good teaching game for people new to wargaming or younger players. However, when you get right down to it, the game boils down to how well the tiles fall once the fellowship reaches Mordor. All the time, effort and cards you spent maneuvering (what little maneuvering there is at 1 area per turn), mustering, battling and sieging is often, ultimately, a complete waste. This game is a case study in how a great theme (not to mention plastic bits) can obscure mediocre mechanics and pacing.

Lastly, as others have pointed out, this game will not stand up to repeated plays. There is only 1 path to victory for each player, and the rest is up to the action dice and cards.

RATING: 10
This is one of my favorite game of all time. My first play was marred by rule look-ups and players with AP. We even tried to use the four player variant, which I would never attempt again. On subsequent plays, the rules have become intuitive, and they fit the theme flawlessly.  There is not a game out there that I think brings out the theme better.  While I have not won a single game, I would love to play this again and again.

What I liked:
* Everything about the game is very, very thematic

* Too long, almost takes as long to watch all 3 movies!

Not often does a game leave you thinking after it is played...but War of the Ring did that to me.

"War of the Ring" does something few games can: it manages to create a unique, borderline literary/cinematic experience everytime its played.  Again we get great production values from Fantasy Flight, adding a lot to the appeal.  There's just enough details in the rules to make you feel as if you're playing something substantial without getting too fiddly.  My one gripe: a rulebook that seems to have lost clarity in translation.  Having said that, there are tons of player aids out there (and here for that matter!) that help you with this.  A great game experience!

Borrowed this game and played it with my wife. The new player version was so unbalanced it ended in 4 turns when the dark player took the whole of Gondor and most of Rohan without any resistance.

In our second game we played the full game. The game was closer, with the light player (me) winning due to some bad dark player rolls, which allowed me to counterattack Isengard (before Saruman was in there). I also took the whole of Angmar. Meanwhile, the fellowship only got around Moria, but got struck with 5 corruption when my wife got Shelob's lair into the game.
Luck (dice rolls, card draws) are too important in determining the winner, and took a bit away from our enjoyment. It was also a bit too long to keep us interested.

Why did I ever let anyone talk me into trying this?  I only played this game once but it had WAY WAY too many rules.  There was not enough clarity in the rules.  There were tons of extraneous rules to remember that had little to no effect on the over-all outcome of the 4+ hour game.  I am lost as to how so many geeks give this game a 10!  I have to assume they would like almost anything with the Lord of the Ring theme and tons of cool components (which I do like for the most part).  The geek rating is certainly NOT based upon the elegence of the game mechanics.  I just assume that people really enjoyed the experience of playing the game because it brought the Tolkien world to life for them.  Maybe if I had more free time the experience would have been better for me too.  Instead, it was tedious and laborious.  I would love to see this game remade as a 1 - 2 hour game (like Puerto Rico) and with the elegance of what I have grown to expect from the best European style games.

Almost the game I wanted on this subject and at this scale, but not quite. I agree with those who complain about the size of the card text and that some of the town/city icons could be clearer. I'm also not a big fan of the board generally - Middle-earth, at least most of the west of it, should be greens rather than the drab tans and browns. I don't like the figures much either. They are good sculpts, although the Nazghul are a little impractical for a crowded game board, but the colours are all over the place. They are too bright and mixed up - I would have preferred all of the units from the same race to be of the same colour and to have been of a less jarring hue - the orcs should have been black, the Urukai brown etc. In fact I think I would have preferred the whole thing with cardboard counters with good quality art on them. Just aesthetics maybe but it does result in some playability issues and in a game where theme is so important so are the aesthetics in conjouring up that theme.

These whinges aside it is still a good game and is easily the best Tolkein game that allows you to move armies/characters at a strategic level across a map of middle-earth. Despite my gripes it still captures the theme well and the combat mechanic is much superior to that of Risk, which was a worry I had on first reading the rules. The theme adds at least a mark for me and if you like boardgames and Tolkein this really is a must buy. 

It's a bit like the movie - not without it's faults but still excellent and the best that we can really expect on an immensely difficult to realise, but cherished, subject.

RATING: 10
This game is perfection.  It beautifully captures the Lord of the Rings story.  It uses an simple and elegant dice action point allowance system that works fluidly and allows for a different game every time.  The theme is pervasive and at no point do the mechanics pull you out of the story that is developing.  There is constant tension as the Free Peoples attempt to sneak past the massive armies of Sauron.  This is a permanent fixture in my collection.

RATING: 5
Huh.  How is this possibly in the top ten?  Wife and I thought it did capture the feeling of LotR; I was totally stressed as Sauron needing just one more city before Gimli and the ring made it to the end.  But for the long amount of time the game takes, it just didn't feel fun.  I think the dice-action mechanic takes too much choice away from you.  So the game is driving itself towards the conclusion and we are just watching.  How about something like an AP system where it gets progressively more expensive to pick the same action. Like 1-2-4 AP, and Good gets 4AP and Evil gets 7AP, just like the number of dice.  That way, you'd be choosing what happens and actually playing the game.

RATING: 10
This game deserves the hype.  There are so many tough choices.  So many things you want to do with limited options.  And the theme is amazing.   However one drawback I found initially was the fact that the spaces are too small for all the pieces.  Even using chips (ala Axis and Allies) to substitute for the figures doesn't free up enough space and makes things clunky.  This can have a negative impact on strategy as the pieces unknowingly bleed over to adjacent spaces.  And the Nazgul look cool, but they are too tall and top-heavy...they are constantly falling over. I fixed it by taping pennies to the bottom of them.  Also I wish the print on the event cards was larger.However, this one is still going strong after 6 plays with good replayability. I always want to play this incredible game...and I don't expect it to change anytime soon.  This one is a 10 now (and has moved from 7->8->9->10).  The small spaces are not a big deal once you get used to them.Update...after 13 plays this is now my favorite game.  I didn't think any game would supplant Dune, but this matches Dune in every category except diplomacy.  Still, I find myself thinking about playing WotR more than Dune nowdays.  Everyone I've taught the game to has also liked it.

Update:  The new release has gotten even better and fixed the few minor complaints that I had.  I mean they fixed everything that I suggested.  Larger cards. Extra Dwarven elite deployed during startup.  Troop box and army markers (to reduce overcrowding).  Better map layout that shows adjacencies more clearly.  Shorter Nazgul.  Fixed wording on cards.  If I have to find a negative it would be worse quality dice and maybe the mini's are a little too bendable.  But cmon...the game itself is a true 10...and now the components are 99% perfect.  A true 'must have' in any serious gamer's collection.

Lovely looking game themed on the War of the Ring.  Players represent the Fellowship against the Shadow Alliance.  This breaks down into Elves, North, Dwarves, Gondor and Rohan up against Isengard, Mordor and Haradrim/Easterlings.  Dice are tossed that generate actions, akin to being dealt a hand of cards in a card driven wargame.  Actions are spent on recruiting, campaigning, playing events or on the ring game.  The ring game is an abstracted journey from Rivendell to Sauron's Smithy, with Sauron dogging the footsteps and tossing corruption at the Fellowship.  Sauron is trying to recover the ring or win a military victory before the ring is destroyed.  Some issues with the graphics on the board - the town/city/fortress icons are too small, too alike, and disappear as soon as you plonk a few units down - I'm painting up some wooden houses so at least we can see them.  The event cards donate 50% of their area to ornate bordering, with the important text crammed into tiny 5 point font in the remaining 50% - a shame. Still, the gameplay is superb.  The designers obviously understand the book, as all the pressures of force and time are here, and it's been superbly developed into a balanced, thematic game.  This game is a must for Tolkien fans, and worth a try for anyone else.  Great effort.

Second edition (from ARES) is here and fixes several problems - much better graphics and cards you can actually read.  My favourite game, by quite a margin.

Interesting mix of fantasy and war game. Not for the casual player. Haven't gotten into it too much because of the complexity. It is not for family game night, but is a good game if you want a light-weight, miniatures focused war game. A few interesting twists to keep the LOTR theme from just being too nominal. Hope artwork and board layout improved with later edition.

RATING: 3
The game has good details that do not make up for the fundamental flaws that ruin it: 1) the Fellowship player has far less activity than the Mordor player, 2) a dice roll at the start of each turn determines your strategic direction and you only make tactical responses to these dice, hence it felt like the game was playing me instead of vice versa 3) the game resembled "Star Wars: Queens' Gambit" moreso than any other game, lacking new mechanisms or interactions. A derivative of Risk with action cards that attempt to add flavor of the books to a bland wargame. Like many recent "light wargames", it is focused on memorizing and playing the overpowered cards instead of strategic thinking.

RATING: 9
Great board, the appeal of the whole materials is gorgeous for quantity and beautiness.
The rules are rather complex, but not hard, if read more than once. They cover in a magistral way the facts of LotR books, and the game seems fully replayable, rewriting every time the history of the WotR.
For now, the game earns a 9, it's really fun (almost perfect, but too long); time (and hype) passing will bring +/-1, not less.
Note: this is the only game for wich I've had fun reading session reports!
UPDATE: I played it again after some months, thinking to refine my vote downgrading after the hype. Instead, my 9 still remains, it's a gorgeus game, fun to play; its only drawback is length...

RATING: 9
I'd call WOTR a cross between Risk, the LotR Boardgame, and Star Wars: Queen's Gambit.  Overall, it most closely resembles the last of those.  QG is also an asymmetrical wargame where one side applies overwhelming force while the other attempts to stall long enough to complete their side quest.  QG also limits your available actions each turn, but uses cards rather than dice.  My wife and I really enjoy QG, but WotR is a richer, more rewarding experience.  

The game is all about playing well to maximize your odds of winning the race through Mordor.  The fact that you can play very well yet still lose due to bad Mordor tile draws is a plus for me, not a detriment.  After all, if the endgame is determined before the end, why bother playing it through at all?  However, skillful play definitely dramatically increases your odds of ultimately winning.  Sometimes as the FP especially I feel like the Hunt in Mordor was tragically unfair, but upon retrospection I realize that I should have spent longer healing before plunging into Mordor.  The luxury to do that, is of course provided by doing well on the military front.  I really love the interaction of the military and the hunt for the ring components of the game.

I still find this game to be a new challenge each time, as the players must shape their strategies around the cards they have available, and I've not yet come close to exhausting the interesting combinations that can arise.

Plus, my wife loves the game.

I think I would be willing to pay for a fully painted set of miniatures on this one!  

A few drawbacks - the die rolling here is generally exciting and fair overall.  However, as with any game with dice, a string of outlier rolls can tip the game.  Also, I did not find this to be playable out of the box - I had to take quite a bit of time to color the bases of the figures.  The map is also a bit hard to manage sometimes, and the cardboard counter to replace the figures don't work really well.  This might be inevitable, however, as I suppose the map couldn't be much bigger, and I wouldn't want smaller miniatures (or would I?  Actually smaller miniatures that came in distinct colors for each nation would have been fine with me!)

Overall, my wife and I always look forward to playing this and will center weekend afternoons around it.  We have managed to play games of this in under 2 hours, but in general you should allow 3-4.

UPDATE May 2011: I toyed with giving this game a 10 for a while, but in the end can't do it for two reasons. 1) It is too fiddly - I still need to hit the rulebook and FAQ every game.  2) It is either has too much of the game outcome dependent on luck, or it needs to be shorter.  
Don't get me wrong, thing is an great epic game, but isn't perfect.  Also, -0.5 points because you pretty much have to paint the figures some how to tell the armies apart.  Couldn't they have molded in different color plastics?

UPDATE UPDATE (5 whole days later): Screw it, WotR is a 10.  This is one of those rare games that gives me a visceral excitement n my gut just at the thought of playing it.  The game may not be perfect, but love ain't always easy.  Still minus half a point for making me paint all the minis just to play, though (Collector's Edition gets the full 10!)

Played as a 3 player and loved it.  The Fellowship barely destroyed the ring with 1 corruption point to spare and the Free people had lost 9 points worth of territory.  I am looking forward to further plays.  High quality componets and tough decisions throughout.......a big winner.

I have now played this as a 2,3 and 4 player game and it shines with each of those numbers.  A theme drenched game that scales well.

If there is a better narrative-driven wargame, I have not seen it.   A most impressive design, with all the story elements in there, and yet you will find yourself always mixing things up.  Like, "Remember when Boromir made it back to Gondor alive?" or "when Legolas stayed with Frodo and Sam into Mordor?".   All of that kind of stuff is possible in this game.

With two ways to win for each player, and dual-use cards, there is a lot of strategic tug-of-war happening in this game.  The momentum builds solidly every turn and the last track in Mordor is a constant thrill-ride while you await every tile draw with heavy anticipation.  

The rulebook is a bit of a wreck, but once you see how the game works, it's not all that hard.   Fantastic fun, and the most thematically-rich wargame I own.  Each time I play it, it gets better.

Very interesting way to balance the two sides. One side has all the numerical advantages, but he has more grounds to cover. 

Consider a shopping mall and a thief. The shopping mall has staggeringly more resources to spend on security, but they must be on vigilance 24-7, and cover the entire mall. The thief has the luxury of choosing where and when to make his move, and succeed despite being overwhelmingly outnumbered by man-work hours.

A great game in every way except for one important area: we found it to have very little replay value.

Wading through that awkwardly constructed rulebook was a chore, but worth the effort.  And there are some great play-aids available for this game here on the 'Geek.

But after playing it a few times, we felt that it was always the same.  The Fellowship races like hell to dump the ring before the bad guys can win the military war.  We found that trying to win the war as the Free Peoples was just too hard to pull off, especially against a Sauron player with any sort of experience who knows what to watch for.  And as the Sauron player, trying to find the ring was a waste of resources when it was always so much easier to concentrate on winning the war instead.

Don't get me wrong, we didn't always get the same outcome in game after game; it's just that we found ourselves always using the same strategies for each side.  Although this game offers you "multiple paths to victory," the odds of victory were always far greater if you followed Path A rather than Path B, and that makes Path B seem like a red herring they crammed into the game just so it wouldn't get boring.

Great game in terms of theme, but the movies didn't help it any in that regard.  It's really hard to play the board game and NOT have it mirror the plot of the movie...

RATING: 6
A few plays.  Lots of theme; great sculpts.  A number of rules exceptions to learn.  The game is railroaded too close to the book for my tastes—-the Fellowship player’s only real option for victory seems to be to march Frodo to Mt Doom using one of two viable paths (Moria or high pass). I would have preferred more possibilities for military strategic options for the FP, and/or more “what if” alternate scenarios and victory conditions for more variety (e.g., FP able to use the Ring, or other ways to destroy the Ring), even if that would mean deviations from the book.

For the FP, the game seems more like a Fellowship character game than a wargame; military strategy is purely defensive/reactionary, and is mainly just recruiting in response to SP activity; and there is simply too little for the FP to do compared to the SP, so that it can get boring.  The FP and SP players almost seem to be playing separate games at times, with only indirect interaction in each others’ spheres—-the FP concentrating on Fellowship character stuff, the SP concentrating on military action.  The military action is a bit too abstracted--I wanted more of a military game.  Progressing through Mordor seems too abstract and random with tile draws (and difficult).

I like the action dice mechanism: it creates interesting tactical decisons each turn, as do the cards, although I wonder at the utility of many of the FP event cards.  My feeling from playing the FP is that the game may be too repetitive in an overall sense; the game always seems to cover the same basic pattern (SP conquers several strongholds, Frodo gets to Mordor). Although there are some nice tactical variation and nuances from game to game.

Played my first game of War of the Ring. I enjoyed it. It was a 3 player game. I almost won too as the free people.

Setup of this game is long. Beautiful board and pieces. Don't know if there are balance isssues.

Now that I know the mechanics, I want to play this game again soon to understand them better. After another game, I could give you more details.

Not something I would buy for myself even though I enjoy the theme.

Theme of The Lord of the Rings is awesome.

This is an absolutely brilliant game mechanically speaking, and anyone who loves dudes on a map and/or Lord of the Rings themed games should absolutely have this one in their collection. 

That being said, the miniatures are often hard to tell apart, and the iconography on the board makes the scoring areas frustratingly difficult to identify. Buy this game, but buy the 2nd edition version. It cleans up a lot of the artistic problems.

RATING: 7
Yes, this is a fantastic game to look at. Yes, this game has multiple paths to victory. Yes, this game does have a feel for LotR rather than a tacked on theme. But after a couple of plays I find it hard to understand the high ratings. It's long...very long. Set up is tedious. If you play with a different opponent each time it will add an hour to the game and basic questions will still be asked throughout. It's very hard to differentiate between the Free Peoples troops, the cards can be confusing and often plays are missed because they aren't intuitive. Overall, it rates high on production and quality and quite a bit less in the critical area of playability. I'll try it several more times and perhaps my rating will go up in the future.

RATING: 6
Great!  A great, epic game -- the quintessential LOTR wargaming experience, and maybe a quintessential AT experience.  Asymmetrical setup and powers show a clear understanding of the theme and a respect for the source material.  Held back from greatness by a few cludgy rules and a mediocre rulebook, which requires that you either play it all the time, or spend 20-30 minutes on a refresher course with your opponent.  The pieces could also be made a little easier to tell apart.    

But these are nitpicks!  LOTR is the ultimate fantasy yarn, and WOTR is the ultimate LOTR game (although Knizia's LOTR is equally awesome in totally different ways).

I've only played once, as a 4 player partnership game, but although initially a bit confusing I really enjoyed it and would certainly like another go. I can see that once I had a better grasp of what cards might be available that better strategies might be possible.

Having acquired my own copy I finally played a 2p game (intro version). This went OK, but was more tricky than it needed to because of a) the difficulty of distinguishing between the different nations and b) working out what the symbols on the dice meant and what you could do. However, am now eager to try the full game!

RATING: 5
In my comments for AGot I said it felt like Risk, however I feel this game feels more like Risk than AGoT does.  Thankfully, it has a lot more going on in it than Risk which makes it so much better.  Some of these mechanics include: cards having combat effects and board effects, managing the fellowship, the hunt for the ring, the political track, and siege combat.  Overall, good, but a bear to setup. Also, I have a natural dislike of games that include unpainted miniatures instead of tokens/meeples. For a long 2-player game, I would rather Twilight Struggle. I haven't played it yet, but Through the Ages would also likely be a better 2-player long game for me. Those who like Ameritrash will probably love this. The second edition is better than the first.

Anyway, I haven't seen a game this dripping with theme and yet having great mechanics since Dune.  The free peoples have a unique feel that is totally different from the Shadow player, but they seem to be well balanced.  There may or may not be a balance problem.  I haven't played enough games to know for sure, but it was not immediately detectable in one game.  The only downer is that it takes so friggin long... just like Dune.

I suspect I've overrated this game, but it's hard to fault a game that gets the epic feel of LotR right.  It doesn't do everything right, but I can't imagine how one could make an epic strategy game of the war of the ring that does things better than this.  The feeling of being the Free People's player, watching the armies of Sauron bear down on you, all the while struggling to move the ring forward, trying to hide what you're doing and buying the time to get the ring to Mount Doom is fantastic.  The event cards generally capture key events from the book well, allowing exciting reversals for both sides.  It does seem a little unbalanced, but then things weren't really balanced in the books, so this hardly bothers me.

RATING: 9
What a game!  The flavor and attention to detail is fantastic.  And it's a great game with lots of strategy.  I am amazed at how the game feels so true to the books, and yet gives the players so much freedom in recreating this war on their own terms.  The only part of this game I find somewhat irksome is the die rolling in combat, but that is more a personal preference than a criticism of the game.

Well designed game that models the trilogy well, but it is complicated and takes a long time to play.  Steep learning curve.  In principle I love this game, but because of the complexity and time commitment I just don't get to play it much.  In fact, I tend to forget the rules between plays.

Sadly, this was never hitting the table and I really don't have anyone to play this with nor the time required so I traded my copy away.

The Fellowship has only one strategy: head for Mount Doom. This makes their game less interesting. How many times can you play a game where there's only one clear-cut strategy for one side? The Sauron player has slightly more options but not much. Replayability is therefore in question, but the components are nice enough that they could entice me for another game. That is, except for the poor execution in graphics, map layout and lack of practical usability of all those nice bits...

Recently tried this for the first time.  I really enjoyed it and think the SP bias might be a bit overstated.  I nearly pulled off a victory as the FP (one space away) and think the FP would have won had we not goofed up Mordor.  (Max forgot that there could only be one Eye Die allotted / Companion.)  It was a very tense and fun game.

Best Tolkien themed war-game.  2-4 players, 3 hours, high complexity 5/5.  Is it a Risk/Allis-Allies style game, as some suggest?  According to my well-informed and reliable buddy, this is an unfair characterization of the game, because it is totally unique and brilliantly contrived to fit the books very well.
Impressions after two plays: the assymetrical aspect of the game is well done - each player has different objectives, yet the game seems well balanced. The various plot lines (military conquest by Sauron's forces, ring dunking by Fellowship, potential for corruption) seem well worked together and very thematic, giving a real sense of the drama of the original story, and potential for a tense finish.

WotR is truly a masterpiece of a game, which befits the grandeur of Tolkien's imaginative world perfectly! Strategic storytelling and military decisions with some luck-driven (aka dice roll and card draw) factors to keep every new game fresh, exciting and different leads to good replayability, and ever-changing stories which unfold during the game. Some may be true to the original plot of the books, some will differ quite a lot, allowing a sort of "What if...?" alternate history. The best thing, though, is that while playing you will eventually find yourself immersed in Middle Earth and its struggles of good vs. evil. A true gem!

This is probably the best 2 player Ameritrash game out there - tense, interesting and incredibly thematic.  I've played this twice, and am eager to see it hit the table again.

Was never able to establish a regular opponent. The game was fun enough but I was never able to get to the point that I could flow through a game.

[u]The Good[/u]: 1) Has clever mechanics that represent the flight of the ring bearer. 2) Does a good job at touching on many of the major events that take place in the books, and yet still allows the players to forge their own path.

[u]The Bad[/u]: Has less depth than I would have prefered. If it were a bit less Risk-like in the way it handled its units, even without a true solitaire mode this game would easily be in my top 3.

[u]The Bottomline[/u]: Highly recommended for Lord of the Rings fans, and really shines when both players are well familiar with the setting.

I have only played partway through a game of this as it so large and takes so long.

Still what I did play felt very one-sided in favour of the forces of darkness especially since there forces go back to their supply if destroyed and the forces of good are gone from the game.

Still I will give it another go if I ever find a table big enough.

RATING: 7
This game is really long, and non-hardcore gamers will likely balk at the ruleset.  That said, seasoned wargamers will find plenty of familiar concepts here.  Basically the good guys have to dunk the ring before the bad guys' inevitable military victory, requiring a balanced approach on the good guys' part (resisting just enough to delay defeat, but also keeping the focus on sneaking to Mt. Doom).  Given the game length and overall complexity, it's a little surprising they didn't go even further in the complexity direction.  I have only played this as a 2-player game.

The 3-4 player rules are somewhat laughable, as they simply divide a side's army in half and give each to a different player.  I can see how that would affect the pacing of board movement, and admit there might be more of a difference than I can predict, but if I have more than 1 opponent available for that much time, I'll probably look for a game where everyone can serve a more selfish interest.

I feel one will either love or hate this game, as its one of the worst dice-fests to ever grace my table.  However it also has some of the best implemented themes I've ever seen, and really forces the players to become involved in the alternative Middle-Earth history they are creating.  this is one of those games you need a whole day to complete, and I've yet to see a game last under four hours, especially since the rules are incredibly complex, and the rulebook tends to be frustratingly vague, confusingly worded and badly organized.  There is also a lot of downtime as well as potential for frustration due to the over-reliance on dice and random card draws.  This aside, its one of those few games that creates an organic story out of a gameplay session that you will probably be taking about with your friends for a while after.  Not something to play frequently, but a must-play for fans of Tolkien, or epic gaming adventures.

This game uses great elements from many existing systems in a nicely streamlined way.  The turn sequence and choices during a turn are interesting enough to sustain a certain tension throughout the game and I like this very much.  While the dice provide random choices which keeps the game from being too predictable, it is my impression that there are probably few good openings but many different ways of executing them.  But I think enough experimenting would underscore a few obligatory moves on both players.  Still, I find the drama of every turn to be enticing.  However...

Who has the audacity to take wonderful John Howe art and ruin it with what is definitely the worst design of a map I have ever seen.  I am convinced this was not picked in playtesting simply because the testing was done with counters or such.  Incidentally, GIVE ME COUNTERS AND NOT TOYS!!!  Those figurines are klunky and impede the game; good old counters would have been perfectly suited for this game.  Would have made the game cheaper and not one bit less fun.

Looks like a really fun game. I'd have bought it already, but I'm not so sure I'll get to play it often - apparently takes about 3 hours to play if you know what you're doing, and requires extensive discussion to be playable. The collector's edition of the game looks even better, but I'd be dreaming if I were to even think of putting that down on my wish list.

Update:  Played some more and raised it from a 7 to an 8.  I could really see diving into this game with the right player (hopefully my son in a year or so).  The artwork and theme are inviting and it's fun just to push armies across that big board.  I think the action dice thing is a nice change of pace from other games.  I can't claim to rate this game on it's strategies or depth because I haven't been there yet, but it does capture the fun of a risk style area movement game that I loved as a kid.  Of course the theme and artwork is a huge draw for me!


Update:  I cubed it.  I kept the plastic elite troops and leaders and used wooden cubes for the lower ranks.  I also spray painted units to make it easier to tell things apart.  It really cleaned up the board and made it easier to read the map.  It's much more inviting to play now. 

Only one play, could go up.  I'm not wild about the crowded plastic figures.  Still, fun so far...  I really like the big map with all it's areas.  I might convert the plastic figures to wooden cubes just to uncrowd the game.  I'm a sucker for big, beautiful area maps.  I recomend it.

This is Ameritrash done right, although it really feels mostly like a wargame.  It really brings the story to life.  Luck all over the place, but tons of strategy and interesting decisions too.  As a new player, having to keep track of two text options is a bit much.  I prefer the normal cdg style of event or points.  Still, the game is just so damn thematic.  I'm seriously excited to see how the story develops as I play this.  Long, but worth it.

[Light Wargame, Risk Clone - Dice for Combat, Dice for Actions, Event Cards, Plastic Minis] [2P:3] Inelegant. Clunky. Unintuitive. Frustrating graphic design decisions. Worst of all for a dyed-in-the-wool JRRT fan, War of the Ring only superficially captures the feel of Middle Earth for all that chrome. Could definitely have done without a lot of the fancy bits (What the heck is the point of having all the fancy figs if you already know they won't fit on the map and so you need to have the cardboard chits - just use the chits and scratch the figs! Oh that's right we need to figs to up sales to unsuspecting people will ooh and ahh at them. The mini/chit juggling lengthened the game and made it so fiddly that the next time we played we left the minis in the box. What a crying waste. And what's the point of having all the different looking figures of THEY'RE ALL THE SAME? ARGH!) and pretty symbols in exchange for streamlining and usability. Did they REALLY have to have different symbols for the good and evil dice? Perhaps I've been spoiled by the simple elegance of The Confrontation, which has much more JRRT flavor in fifteen minutes than WOTR does in three hours. WotR is clearly outclassed by H:RvC and HotS from a playability standpoint; disappointing to say the least. The game is extremely RANDOM RANDOM RANDOM and has a disproportionate amount of compounded LUCK LUCK LUCK, even for a wargame. Dice to determine your actions (unforgivable), Event card draws (with some questionable balance in the cards), dice to resolve combat, dice to resolve the search for the ring, and to finish it off, a tile draw to determine the effects of a successful search. The entire "Hunt" segment of the game is laughable. I'll stop short of calling WotR terrible or broken (it's not), but it's tremendously disappointing, random and luck-driven. As a Tolkein fan, and as a boardgame fan, I cannot recommend this game at all unless you are hopelessly enamored of Risk variants. And by the way - the 3 & 4 player claim is a joke, this is a 2P game only. 3 & 4P simply splits the duties normally handled by a single player among two players. Unless you're comfortable with a very high degree of luck in a 3-hour game, much more so than a quality wargame that plays in the same amount of time (my point of comparison is always AH's Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, and Columbia's Hammer of the Scots), and you're very tolerant of usability issues in a game's design, I would strongly advise that you at the very least try before you buy. Even if you are a huge Lord of the Rings fan like I am. ***UPDATED: Added weight rating of "light" due to randomness. It doesn't really matter what you do; whoever rolls better and draws better, wins.

Não apenas um lindo jogo como uma grande peça de estratégia, em especial pelas cartas que dão uma dinamica especial a cada rodada. O tema é abarcado com perfeição pelas regras, fazendo parecer durante o jogo que relemos o livro (ou uma outra versão deste). Nota máxima para a mecânica da movimentação da Irmandade. Bem adequada a forma de equilibrar as forças das Gentes Livres e das Sombras: uns precisam de poucas conquistas para vencer o outro possui força ilimitada.

Allows the players (keep it to two) to relive the LOTR. There is more to this game than I have had time to explore, but the storytelling is fantastic.  I love that in a game.

It is a little complex, and not for the faint of heart. Down time isn't bad at all, with the way turns are structured. Reading the cards is a little tough, due to the small font, but a pair of reading glasses (which I was starting to need anyway) fixed that. 

Update, 12/2013:
I am now playing with the 2nd edition cards, which were sold separately to allow 1st edition copies to play as second edition.  The main reason is that the cards are bigger with bigger printing - much easier to read.  It also fixed some balance issues as I understand it, though I am not experienced enough to really speak to that.

Not perfect, but still my favorite board game.  It is an asymmetric game based on Lord of the Rings.

The 3-4 player rules are tacked on.  Very lengthy, and the rules are complicated, but it's an amazing game.

A friend and I we're playing the game for the first time, in my finished basement back in September.  We stepped through the setup and about two rounds before we ceased playing for the evening.

About an hour later, my 2 and-a-half year old decided to pry my refrigerator open and poor himself some juice.  Instead of grabbing a juice box, he yanked a quart sized container of crystal light lemonade on to the floor.  Well, the top flew off and the lemonade ran underneath the fridge, down the ice maker water line and dripped all over the game.

Let me tell you something, that nasty stuff instantly curled the game map off of the cardboard backing.  It must have reacted with the glue....

So... I'd love to rate the game, but I've got to purchase a new one first.

I won’t comment on the strategic aspects of this game because I’m sure that the majority of War of the Ring players has already commented this way.  I’ll just say I’m an incredible admirer of J.R.R. Tolkien´s works and certainly I can say that War of the Ring is, as good as it’s possible, accurate to the original history: for example, when some particular events happen during the game, I’ve realized that this occurs in the same sense and meaning as in Tolkien´s books, as if a mysterious will could make them become real! (In fact, this is, in my opinion, one of the strong points of the game).
So… great strategy, good concordance to the history, well defined rules, incredible board and piece design… what more can you ask for? (If I could, I would give a better qualification than 10 to this game. Get it or repent of your bad decison!)

Epic is the one word to describe this game. The thematic integration is awesome, it really feels like reenacting the saga much of the time, albeit in some kind of alternate universe where the story doesn't follow quite the familiar path.

The game is very long and luck or the lack of it, either in drawing cards, chits, or throwing dice, can be a decisive factor but in general the game feels well balanced. The combat system bugs me a little (as might be expected from a descendant of Risk) although I cannot quite pinpoint why.

If it wasn't quite so long this might even get a 7, as it is I don't think I'd want to play more than once in a while.

Finally got it to the table. The rules took waaay longer than expected, and we didn't get to finish our first game, but it looks like it might be one of those nerve wracking, and frustrating, dice games. I can handle those at times, but when I have such a large force and can't win, that gets me pretty upset. I prefer to keep my friends, not my games, so I'll have to see how this plays out in the end before I can rate it.

This game is much bigger, longer, and more complicated than I was expecting.  I should have read more about it before putting it on my Math Trade wantlist.  I was able to learn the rules and play half a game.  It was fun, but it's quite a time investment for a game, and just barely worth the effort to learn all the rules.  Now that I know the rules, I'd be more willing to play again, but it's not worth keeping since opponents for it would be hard to find.  

Traded away... but might reacquire it someday if I have an opponent.

While I enjoyed the game, it felt very scripted.  I felt like while the details may change slightly, the overarching strategies of the two sides would always be the same.  I also felt it was very random, since dice tell you if it's possible to act or not, thus sabotaging strategy on a turn-by-turn basis.  Finally, some of the cards' text are too small for some of my friends to read comfortably, making it unenjoyable for me to force them to play.

Slightly complicated and long, but that's what you should expect from a truly epic game.

The rules are well written IMO, I learned them by heart with 2 readings. The rate could change with more playings, at the moment I can say this is the game I've been waiting for a lifetime, a really immersive game experience.

Not a "wargame" in the purest sense at all, and I think it's important to understand this.  As a GAME with a war theme, this one shines.

This game is a mixed bag. It has a number of interesting sub-systems, for insistence its "hiding in plain sight" fellowship procedure, but is seriously marred by its lack of development/design. To name just a few of its most glaring problems:

1. Many cards are far too complex. (Just imagine what it's like having a handful of cards saying something along the lines of, "You can do "A" if you have "B" in area "C," as long as "D" is not in area "E, except when your opponent has already played card "F." And this with a map that makes finding specific areas almost impossible.) In addition, the card's font size is so small you have to wonder if it's even possible to request it that way. (Bring a microscope.)   
2. The figures are indistinguishable. Most of them seem to be either the same color or the same shape. (Bring a powerful microscope). 
3. The markers are all but meaningless. Now I suppose this design decision had something to do with international sales, but why they settled on a political marker system that generates confusion in ALL languages is beyond me. For example, couldn't they have kept the almost squiggles, if they thought so highly of them, and superimposed a capital letter, say "D" for dwarf, "R" for Rohan? (Bring someone with a great memory). 
4. The 2-player game is seriously unbalanced as the Nazgul can be used to reinforce Saruman in an "unhistorical" manner. (Bring house rules).  
5. There is an awful lot going on at once. Elegant it's not. (Only play with someone who knows the rather long rules inside and out). 
6. The game has only limited re-playability as there is really only one strategy for each side to use. So each game revolves around how lucky you are in doing what you tried to do in your last game. And as the armies only move one space at a time (including all-cavalry armies), keeping  your intentions hidden from your opponent is impossible.     

Some quick fixes include keeping 2 or 3 magnifying glasses with your set, using miniature Poker chips a la "Axis and Allies," gluing nickels under the Nazgul to keep them from falling over during play, substituting the "Risk-Lord of the Rings" pieces for those provided (they are color-coded and smaller, so more undersized areas become usable on the rather messy board) and suggesting your group try a different game.   

All in all, a potentially fine game, which could have been 200 percent better with competent development.

Great game if you are into these types.  I'm not.  Takes to long.  Dice and card draws bring too much luck and introducing new people to all the rules is not that simple.  Lacks the elegance of simple rules.

RATING: 8
War of The Ring is just the right kind of wargame.  It is dripping with Tolkien theme.  The combat system is dice and battle-card heavy, but interesting and wholly appropriate.  The strategies for victory are many.  While you can't avoid some AP in this game (there are so many choices!) and the unpainted colour scheme of the pieces makes things a little confusing, WotR captures the spirit of Tolkien's world accurately and tastefully so. It is the perfect balance of dice battles and card play with thematic connections throughout. There are quite a few heavy systems working together on this one, which can also bog down the game - but it's as full an experience as you're going to get when it comes to a hundred plastic pieces on a board moving around and battling for who reigns supreme!

Wow. What a game. This has to be one of the best themed games I have ever played. I cannot believe how well they have captured the LOTR story. If you don't know LOTR or don't particularly like it, avoid this game. Otherwise this is a must buy. Best with 2 players, this game can be astonishingly tense. Only downsides are setup time and potentially long-term replayability due to the same board setup each time. This latter has be been addressed somewhat by the expansion though. Love it!

I was on cloud nine after Game of Thrones and Heroscape, and then lo and behold an even BIGGER box arrives in the local game store.  BGG why didn't you warn me?

This game takes forever to set up and break down, forever to play, forever to learn all the rules, and then forever^2 to learn all the cards.  There is so much randomness in the cards that it really destroys any semblence of balance and strategy.  Every time we've tried it was a miserable experience.

Like Elfenland and Puerto Rico: OVERRATED.

RATING: 10
[b][i]War of the Ring[/i][/b] is a rare combination of great theme with great mechanics that work with the theme. 

Allow me to give a sampling of the decisions in a round of War of the Ring. The core mechanic is the action dice that you roll every round. The dice tell you what you can do this round, and since you only have at most 10 dice it might seem like you don't have that many options. In truth, there are many possibilities (and this can paralyze newer players). For example, suppose you rolled 3 army results. Those dice must be used to mobilize armies on the board, but there are so many choices on where to move. Are you going to use those dice to reinforce/assault the men in Minas Tirith? The men of Gondor are strong, but conquering Gondor puts the Shadow half-way to victory. Or should you help/attack the elves of Lothlorien? It's a single stronghold, but shadow control of Lothlorien is an ideal staging area for moving in many directions and if you take it early you can hopefully interfere with the Fellowship movement. Should you wait until the end of the round when your opponent is committed to a strategy or should you perform your moves immediately before your opponent has time to adjust his strategy? And what about your newly drawn Rohan-based action cards, are these powerful enough to switch your attention to the horse lords? Meanwhile, what about your opponent? Should you set the pace of the game through aggression or should you only react to their actions? These aren't easy decisions, but they are fun.

Behind the military deployment is the Fellowship progression which acts as a game clock which the players partially control. The variable game clock is clever game design, and it's seamlessly integrated into the theme. So well is the theme integrated into this game that you don't even think of it as a game mechanism, but rather as the Fellowship marching towards Mordor. If you can imagine the Witch-King proclaiming "Do you not know Death when you see it?" as he smashes Rivendell to put the Shadow within an inch of victory while the Free Peoples hurry the Fellowship through Mordor as they throw caution to the wind, then you should try this game. 

[b]First Edition[/b]
The 1st edition is nearly identical to the 2e. The biggest change is a re-working of the cards for better balance in the 2e. Thankfully, Ares Games published an Upgrade Kit to help out 1e owners.

one of the most monumental games I own and played and one of the best so far. it depicts with really well made minies and board the battles in the war of the ring universe. it's basically a 1vs1 game(even tough more players are permitted with certain variants) that put's the player in the role of either the free people or the evil forces trying to wipe them out. the game is based on a dice sistem that permitts certain actions, features a political background in wich we see expecially free people's different factions reluctant to start the war in the first steps of the game and obviously describes the events of the book and film series. the free people player must either have good military successes(whic is not simple for them)or escort safe and sound Frodo and Sam to thei destination to destroy the ring; the evil forces must either corrupt the company of the ring or almost whipe the free people from the map. every player as it's own diffent kind on cards, special actions and icon heroes that fight along with thei armies

An extremely good and exciting game.  Both sides have lots of different strategies they can take, cards can swing the tide of battle in fun and unexpected ways.  The characters each have powers that are also helpful and unique.  A fabulous game with a rich mixture of options.  I would have to give this a 7 rating as a 4 player game though, the two additional players slow the game down a lot and disrupt the flow.  I think with experienced players the bad guys have a bit of an advantage but mostly a balanced game.

All I can say is "Wow".  And to think, I almost traded this away before playing.  There are only two things that prevent this game from being perfect in my book: 1) some of rules/card interactions are ambiguous (just look at the monster FAQ), and 2) it won't hit the table so much because of its duration.  I doubt if I'll ever be able to play it faster than 4 - 5 hours.

A game that hasn't seen table time more than twice, takes quite an effort to setup, but the main problem for me is I can't find anyone to play this with me.  There are quite a lot of rules, none of which are particularly abstract, but still it takes two people with some serious dedication to play this and not only that, you need two people both of whom likes Lord of the Rings.  I admit I am a fanboy ever since I read the book in my University years, but the mystic isn't as strong if you've only seen the movie.  The situation is compounded by the fact I live in Hong Kong and people that have read the book is few and far between.

So my rating for this has a disclaimer:  I have play this twice and soloed twice, its not much to base a rating on.  But I will give this a 7 for the gameplay I've seen, I like the victory conditions which is thematic.  I like the production value, I don't have the special collector's addition, I would've brought that if I played enough of this game, but o'well, the original is pretty acceptable also.

I really would love this game if the combat resolution would not be done by rolling dice.
The luck factor within the action dice mechanic is ok, but the combat dice rolling really turns me off. I much prefer combat resolution similar to "A Game of Thrones" or "Dungeon Twister".

RATING: 9
Rating went up after few plays. Very enjoyable, highly thematic game with a nice amount of detail. Especially the moving of the fellowship and hunting for it are excellent mechanics. Few cards are bit too scripted to the events in the books (requiring specific character to be in a spesific place while something specific is happening) and the plastic miniatures are sometimes somewhat cumbersome (but pretty), but otherwise it's hard to find anything to complain about in this game.

If I could give this game a thematic rating, it would be a 10. It totally captures the JRR Tolkien universe and will give you a new appreciation of the overall events of the LotR storyline!

The components are AMAZING! (even the non collectors edition which I have)

However, and I may be against the majority...the rules are horribly fiddly. There is so much going on...and you never really feel like you have tons of control. Armies move very slowly. Because of this, it drags a lot. The map is cramped...especially with the figures on it. The battle system is basically just Risk...with the option to add card bonuses. Even though, I think it's awesome how they have rules for the Fellowship movement that represent the dangers of the story very very well, the rules for that are also fiddly. 

Last game I played took almost 4 hours. Neither of us wanted to play afterwards...whereas my opponent and I could play Twilight Struggle and not feel that the 4 hours was as draining.

So now we have seperate entries for WotR first edition, WotR second edition, WotR special edition?

Seriously?

I just don't find this a good game.  It's like Risk, but a lot more complex.  All this complexity doesn't add to the fun. The tiny models also all have the same color and it's very difficult for those not familiar with LoTR to tell the difference between different races, not to mention that the cards, while thematically excellent, require knowledge of the LoTR universe.  The rules are not intuitive and the rulebook is a mess.  During the middle of the game, it's getting more clear each turn who's going to win, and then it's a drag until the game ends.  You know, like Risk.

1 play (starter rules).  Appears to have a very interesting gameplay/mechanics, quite unlike any other wargame I've played (attacker vs. defender, where the time 'limit' is determined by the ring quest - Where the attacker can use some of his resources to 'thwart' the ringbearer, thereby giving himself more time.)  As I said interesting, and I'm looking forward to the more advanced rules.
Second Play (advanced) - impressions: What an incredibly balanced and tense game.  Delicious.  Took too long, but that was my fault as I was just learning the rules/reading the cards/learning how to play.   Looking forward to my third game which should play alot faster!  Next game took almost half the time.  I got a bit of analysis paralysis on the last few turns, mostly because I couldn't figure out why my opponent was doing what he was doing.

"Guerra del Anillo" es sin lugar a dudas un magnifico juego de estrategia. Destaca la calidad de los componentes, sobre todo el precioso mapa de la Tierra Media y las estupendas miniaturas.

Pero mas alla de esa cuidada presentacion, que tambien podemos encontrar en otros juegos con una mecanica semejante a la del "Risk", estamos ante un verdadero juego de estrategia. Los disenadores han logrado transmitir el sabor de "El Senor de los Anillos" al juego, y han creado un reglamento que, sin ser demasiado complicado, logra que el juego tenga una notable profundidad.

A destacar, sin duda, la elegante forma en que se ha resuelto el viaje de la Compania del Anillo hacia el Monte del Destino, y la interaccion de los Companeros que la van abandonando (Gandalf, Trancos, Gimli, Legolas...) con la diplomacia y las operaciones militares.

Las cartas son otro gran hallazgo, ya que contribuyen a dar sabor a cada partida, y tienen un doble uso, como eventos o como cartas de combate.

En definitiva: un gran juego que merece la pena, y que no resulta tan caro en comparacion con otros juegos de estrategia, teniendo en cuenta la calidad y cantidad de componentes. El unico "pero" puede ser la duracion de una partida: hacen falta entre 4 y 5 horas para terminar una. Si eres fan de "El Senor de los Anillos", y si te gustan los juegos de estrategia o quieres iniciarte en ellos, "Guerra del Anillo" es un titulo imprescindible.

Wow, the passion this game has solicited from all quarters of BGG is amazing.  From fights over font size to shills and even comments on nationalism!?.  As one person said, quoting Shakespeare, "The game's the thing."  

Yes, some have real concerns over hype, peice and area size, and a high luck factor, but the truth of the matter is that this is a highly playable game with replay value.  It's a 7 as I will play this again, but not anytime, and thus a good ranking is warrented; but it's by no means a 8 or 9.  If you are a europlayer unused to 2+ hour games, this is hardcore.  The luck factor may turn you off as well, but there are so many hard decisions that need to be made at every turn that you may find more resemblance to the familiar.  Two bonuses that make this a clear winner in purchasing at full price are: 1) it's a Lord of the Rings game that is beyond the spin-off genre, it's a strong medium war game; 2) you get a bonus mini hobby as you really need to paint the figs.  Take a serious look at some of the images and see how much love there is for the genre.  Great game, lots of passion, buy it... when all is said and done, the game really is the thing!

BUT BEWARE if you paint the figs and they suck (subjective as that may be), you may find it hard to sell if unsatisfied by the game play.

RATING: 5
A fun game which reminds me slightly of the olden days of Risk and Axis and Allies. A GIANT board, with hundreds of minis, along with in-depth gameplay,  and the theme really sold this one for me. A good war-game when you and a buddy want to sit down and decide the fate of the One Ring.

Slight imbalances could ruin your good time, but I guess these are fixed with the expansion. It's long set up and tear down, have it seeing very little time off the shelf. The production is great, but the figures (unpainted) are hard to tell apart, and having four armies all the same colour make it a virtual nightmare to sort.

But, if you're a LotR fan, and/or a wargamer, you'll likely enjoy this one. I found it to be dry, and far to fiddly for what it's trying to accomplish.

Expect a longer first play (about 6 hours, if it's taking longer you're doing something very wrong), but subsequent plays should be in the range of 4 or 3 hours.

This is "play time" as the setup time is about 30 minutes or more.

Evokes the feelings of both factions really well, you'll feel like you're in the books!

A negative point is that the pieces are cast in blue and red only even though there are actually 8 different nations which complicates your perception of the board a bit.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A generally good wargame, but I have some reservations. I haven't played enough to see replay problems yet, but I expect the game's single scenario will wear thin eventually, so I play sparingly. A few of the pieces are hard to tell apart, and this makes an already cumbersome setup even worse. The "four player" specification on the box is malarkey - it's a two player game, which you can play by committee if you really want to.

RATING: 8
I did not expect to like War of the Ring. When I first read about the project, several warning bells were triggered in my brain: games with miniatures, licensed games, games marketed at teenagers, fantasy wargames, games designed by a "design team," hodgepodge hybrid games in the tradition of Fantasy Flight or Games Workshop, games certain to be overridden with errata, games likely to have all sorts of cumbersome rules exceptions to stay true to the theme. On top of all that, there was already a game called "War of the Ring," and it was a complete mess by almost all accounts. If ever there was a game that I was predisposed to hate, this was it. 

Well, you've already guessed what comes next. I gave it a shot, and I loved it. I'm not convinced it's a game that I'll be playing years from now, but after five plays I'm still excited about playing again. That's good replayability for a game of this length. I would probably have played it several more times already if my main wargame partner liked it as well as I do. Designing a game like this has got to be an extremely tough task, and it's hard for me to imagine the design team doing a better job. The action die system works wonderfully, the cards are good, the war vs. fellowship tension is balanced well, and there are multiple strategic paths – sometimes. I would have liked a bit more flexibility on that last point. Often your strategy is stereotyped by your current card selection or your action dice or the sheer length of time it takes your troops to get to the more remote parts of the board. This is the primary reason I don’t foresee War of the Ring standing up to heavy play over the course of several years. But how many games of this sort really earn that many plays? Very, very few. Overall, War of the Ring succeeds in the dual task of providing an exciting, interesting game and evoking the events and atmosphere of the Lord of the Rings.

After one play: The game was a blast even though it took forever as we muddled through the rules often making mistakes as we went along (The Free Peoples won by destroying the ring albeit just by a hair as the Fellowship was one corruption point away from a Shadow vicory!).  This game is a beautiful translation of the beloved novels which negates the fact that there appears to be a bit of luck involved (not really because of the dice but because of the card play/drawing).  Although, since the cards can be used for two purposes, this luck factor is reduced.  Game length can be a problem, particularly with four players.  It took us 7 hours but that involved a lot of rule flipping so I definitely expect that time to come way down.  For now, I give it an 8.  This could drop or rise depending on whether the strategies and outcomes of each game tend to always be similar.  I recommend it to anyone who is a big LotR fan and to any others who don't mind a bit o' luck 'o the draw in a well thought out light "war" game.

The first few plays I have allways lost with the Free People and I think it is hard for the free people to form a strategy in this game as a beginner, but it gets tighter for every game I have played it. A lot of tension and angst, with a nice chrome.

A lot of moving parts on this design but they mesh together surprising well to deliver a game that is rich in theme and strong in tense gameplay. Dropped my rating after repeated play -- still a good game, but as the novelty fades there is less and less to enjoy about it.

This is the best LotR game I have played.  Some component issues could have been better (ie card font).  However, the game is strategic and tactical with a wide variety of options driven by the clever combination of action dice and cards that creates a new 'story' every time you play.  Definitely a wargame with replay value.

Particularly good game if you are a LotR fan. The game mechanics allow the plot line of the book to be followed along very closely. The integration of the fellowship and the hunt is ingenious. The card system provides a nice way to incorporate numerous 'what ifs'. A very enjoyable way to spend an afternoon or evening.

Perhaps the best theme integration ever. Interesting mechanics, it's an asymmetrical game with some obvious balance issues if you're playing without the expansion. 

Even so, most games I've played have been a down-to-the-wire struggle. Beautiful map (if somewhat hard to read and lacking a lot of green), great bits, overall an awesome production. 

The english rulebook is horrible, however - an organizational mess, and should really be rewritten. The custom player aids here on the Geek make everything that much easier.

I don't seem to like this as much as most people.  The problem is that it only works with 2 players and there's lots of other two-player games I own that are much better (Paths of Glory, Hannibal, Backhand Blow).  But, it still remains a great Ameritrash wargame.

I've only played this three times, so my rating may change.  Nevertheless, I have found this game to be chock-full of agonizing choices for both players, while still capturing the geopolitical situation at the end of the Third Age of Middle-earth.

The game's theme comes through strongly, and you feel the excitement and desperation of the plot while you play. 4-player is a bit akward but it works (if nothing else, it's nice to have someone to commiserate with when Shadow starts getting cocky). My only complaint is LEARNING to play: I don't know if the rulebook is to blame, or if I've lost my ability to learn complex games quickly, but it sure took a long time to settle down and feel comfortable with all the rules.

I want to like this game. In fact there are things about this game that I do like. I'm a big LOTR fan and this game oozes theme. I seem to be becoming more partial to wargames so that aspect of the game appeals to me also. I do want to play this again because, for the most part, I enjoy the experience of playing.
However, for a game that lasts around 3 hours it seems like there is far too much luck involved. In the two games I've played it's basically come down to a crap shoot as to whether good or bad tiles are drawn from the hunt tile bag once the fellowship reaches Mordor. Both times I played as the Shadow side, the first time I won due to corruption of the Fellowship, the second time I lost as they made it to Mount Doom. Both times left me feeling dissatisfied with the result though as it seemed like the previous 3 hours were a waste of time and we could have just skipped to drawing tiles to determine the winner.
Throw in the fact that bad dice rolling for Action Event Die can leave you with very few options, and bad dice rolling in combat can mean strong positions can rapidly turn to crud, and it just leaves a bit of a sour taste in my mouth.
There's almost a great game here but it just doesn't quite work for me.

Rating based upon two games of the intro game only.  Components nice, figures actually kind of weak considering the cost.  Game play is very nice with the intro game easy enough for me to learn and teach my 8-year old as we played our first game in < 3 hours.  Game is a bit complex for a typical board game and a bit light for a typical wargame.

RATING: 7
balancing the war versus the fellowship is a great concept.  excellent theme and design.  game has dropped in my ratings for sitting on the shelf while other games get played; it seems that every game develops along pretty much the same line (clash at Helm's Deep followed by clash at Minas Tirith).  I think the low number of cards per turn, combined with the action dice and low movement rates tends to restrict the amount of viable tactics; you pretty much always know what someone is up to.

Repeated play reveals that the path of the fellowship is the only real element that matters; Sauron will capture the necessary VP, so unless the fellowship moves fast and lucky, it's all over.

That being said, it is fun to play once every year or two for the story and tension.  Just don't take it too seriously.

includes the 2nd edition upgrade kit and Lords of Middle-Earth expansion.

I've read the books, loved the movies, am a big fantasy fan, and love detailed plastic miniatures as well. So I really wanted to like this game, but...

Setup is a pain. Many different miniatures look all the same and I can't understand why they don't come in different colors. The map is horrible to read and gets cluttered already in the setup. Playability suffers from the fidelity to Middle-Earth, as some distant regions are not even worth to bother with. Fiddly rules. Very static and slow gameplay. Cards are very unbalanced, and a lot of them are only useful in very specific situations; too many times you no longer have any chance of using the cards when you draw them. The cards intend to bring some flavor of the story, but without them, the game would probably be twice as fast. Luck fest. No fun.

I have to confess I'm no wargamer, but I own and enjoy a few light wargames, such as "Star Wars: The Queen's Gambit", which also may take long (but is a much better game), and "Nexus Ops", which provides some good light fun.

A pretty awesome LotR veneer cemented onto a mediocre wargame.  While it's cool to see an alternate history of the War of the Ring unfold before you, in the end the game itself is too weak to hold my interest.  Armies move so slowly that there is no interesting maneuvering on the map; while a well-timed card play can lead to a surprise from time to time, most of the military aspect of the game is just a trudge.  The hunt-for-the-ring subgame isn't interesting enough to make up for the shortcomings of the military subgame.  WotR is a lot of flash and very little substance.

Truly an excellent game with lots of ways to win. Plays surprisingly fast, considering the scope.

I especially like the way it combines many simple rules into one elegant whole, which only keeps improving after repeated plays. WotR is beautifully balanced between the war itself and Sauron`s hunt for the ring. The battle system brings A&A to mind, but proves itself to be much more enjoyable.

Seiges are also done nicely: they are epic, hard and long, and usually quite impossible to win without heavy casualties.

Muy buen juego con una cuidada ambientacion y estetica muy del agrado para todo fan de la obra de JRR Tolkien. 

La larga preparacion y las mecanicas algo farragosas dificultan a los jugadores meterse en la partida y tener una buena impresion del juego. En mi opinion una vez superadas estas, Guerra del Anillo consigue su objetivo de reflejar el arco argumental y el desarrollo de la historia de manera analoga al libro y peliculas de "el señor de los anillos" pero por desarrollo y mecanicas queda un poco desmejorado frente a otros juegos de guerra o de aventura. 

Juego al que ayuda mucho disponer de una guia clarificada de las mecanicas de juego. (sin ellas, a pesar de su calidad en materiales, le hubiera cascado un señor 7)

Played the game a few more times. I like it but the game comes down to luck. We'll try it with the expansion next time.

RATING: 8
A great game which ties very closely to the book in terms of events without removing player choice. It is not a hard game to learn (despite the bloated rule book, we use the first rule) but there is a lot of depth and tension as the ring approaches mount Doom. Despite being highly asymmetric I found it very well balanced, the majority of our games get down to the wire and when they do not it is due to a series of errors or good play. 

If you like LoTR you are very likely to enjoy this. The second edition nicely fixed some issues with the first. I got the upgrade cards which were well worth it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Gives an excellent feeling of the LotR theme without forcing your hand or too much rules overhead. Very simple things lead you to same types of decisions that the characters in the books have to make. The layout of the areas on the board is excellent, Rivendell feels like an inaccesible dell tucked away, Moria is the quickest but riskiest route to Morodor although the gap of Isengard is tempting too, Emyn Muil feels blasted and barren. The splitting off of companions linked to the reduction in hunt dice, along with the companions combat abilities isn't an overwhelming push to chuck out everyone but Sam and keeping everyone on board is viable. The combat mechanics feel a bit retro but are servicable and quick. The setup of pieces scattered all through middle earth is good, it makes it more than just a case of lining up on either side and smashing into each other, evil can quickly pose a threat to most areas on the board.

The not so great stuff: The good side is more fun to play. You have more to do, where the evil side is pretty much just racing to smash strongholds. The evil player can win just by the good player crapping up on luck, which feels a bit anticlimatic. It is almost impossible to tell the elves/Gondor/Rohan pieces apart from each other. 

As a side note, the Quantum Fellowship rules are brilliant. The faster they move, the less sure you are of their position. Their position is probabilistic until observed. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Certainly a HUGE improvement over the SPI version, and probably the best depiction of the entire epic war on a board game yet designed. I wish some of the rules could be a little streamlined, though. Like why does a character die move EITHER the Fellowship OR all the other characters? Why not simplify, and have a character die move EVERYBODY or ONE? Wouldn't that be easier to remember? And when is it that a country is activated as opposed to moved on the political track? Can't remember if it's the first time an army is attacked, or when their zone is entered, or a fort captured, or...ug. Little things like that. And the luck dimension is fairly significant. More about allocating dice than anything else. Still, all in all, it's good.

Played only once, but the feeling that I got from this is that it's uncanny how much the game actually feels like LotR! It's a shame it takes so long to play and I don't really remember the rules at all - I'd like to try this again. Could go up as well, but has to stay 8 until I'm able to form an opinion on re-playability and balance of the sides. And it looks pretty good set-up even if you'll never play it. :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Great game, but probably a bit over-hyped as it does have some flaws.  Its a great design and covers the subject matter beautifully.  The components are top notch.  This would be a 10 if the designers would have tried a little harder to make it easy to play.  Its a risk-esque combat system where you roll trying to get 5s to hit.  That sort of game should be easy to figure out straight out of the box.  This game isn't.  If it gets reprinted with some of the niggling issues fixed, this could be a 9.5 easily.


Really fantastic game with a lot of strategic depth.  The rules aren't as bad as people make them out to be, but in places they seem overly complicated for what the results are (for example, the political rules for activating) The icons tell you nothing, the pieces are more difficult to tell apart than they need to be, and there is some gameyness to some of the decision making because of the countermix.  (Example:  too few elf regulars)                                                                                Also, it seems with the super-simple combat rules, it wouldn't have been too difficult to differentiate the units somehow?  Why can't elves get some bonus in forest, dwarves in mountains, etc.  Also, many of the fellowship members special abilities seem very bland.  They could have been sexed up a bit, which would have made a FP victory more possible.  Hopefully the expansion will fix these problems.          

 I also think its too long for what it is, mostly because you know who is going to win part way through in some games.  The action dice seemed neat at first, but really don't constrain your choices that much, and when they do you feel like you've been cheated by lady luck.  Still, a beautiful game thats a lot of fun.  I'll definitely pick up the expansion at some point.                                                                    
                                             Don't get me wrong!!!  This game is tons of fun, and deserves every bit of the  rating I give it.  No CRT, plays fast for a wargame of this scale, and the card and dice combination keeps things interesting.  The pieces are all absolutely gorgeous and I could see myself playing this game every day for a couple of weeks without getting bored.  I agree with folks that say that the icons on the board and bits are impossible to decipher, but I think in a way it adds to the charm of the game.  The game adds for a lot of different strategies on both sides which is a huge plus for a 2 player wargame that isn't based on scenarios.

UPDATE:  In anticipation of this thing getting redone (likely in 2008) with the new parts from the expansion, painted minis, and probably some other new stuff thrown in, I've traded this game.  I'm excited about getting the deluxe edition with the expansion stuff in it.  My next step will be getting a signed "Bill the Pony" card from Kris Hall.

- Great theme

A highly thematic game, nice looking components.  The rules could be much more clear and less convoluted. If you are a Tolkien fan, you of course just had to buy this game; this does not justify the tons of "10" ratings this game has. The components are not well thought:  first of all, without painting, the figures of different peoples look too much alike, and secondly they do not fit on the cramped board; I would have preferred nice tokens.I'll buy some wooden cubes before playing again, I am sure my note will increase.

[Initial Impression: 3]
I love this game...I hate this game...this game scares me!  Huge, expansive, truly epic, all as a Tolkien wargame should be.  There are a lot of fiddly issues with the sameness of the figures (confusing), the fact that a massed army won't fit on the board, that you're constantly looking up card effects and rules (admittedly a first-play issue), and with the dice determining your actions.  But the real death-blow was that, after all that set up, after the in-depth rules reading, after *6 hours*...the remaining members of the Fellowship had infiltrated Mordor, were climbing Mt. Doom and the heat of the fires was rising, just 3 spaces from victory and only about half-way along the corruption track...when a random die roll resulted in a random tile draw, resulting in another random die roll which resulted in an overpowering, hopes-dashing, game-ending 6 added corruption (nothing else in the game can add such a massive amount of corruption at once).  Any game that allows a day-long endeavor to end without regard for strategy (the Sauron player was being far too conservative with his forces and the Fellowship entered Mordor with almost no corruption) is simply hateful.  I sometimes feel like I want to play again, but then the fear grips me...I just haven't had the heart or willingness to tempt fate to get it back on the table. A first experience that may have ruined the game for me.  Ask me to play and re-rate it again in a year, when my pain has faded...

Sep-09: I began to play it again. With all the rules it becomes a really challenging game. It can be a little hard to remember everything and to learn how to use the dice properly, but after that, the game plays smoothly.

Mar-11: Dropped from 8 to 7 due to playing time.

RATING: 5.1
Some good concepts here (the activation dice rolls, political mechanic to get allies into the war, and the different methods of winning), but, serious questions about game balance (too easy for the SP to gain a military victory and too difficult for FP), the are cards too imbalanced and contain too many references for those us that don't live by the fellowship. Also, difficult to understand the ring mechanic (hunt, revealed, located, etc).

I don't understand the hype on this one; other than the theme of course. 7th ranked wargame? Not in the realm of any real wargamers I know.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is superior to the 1978 SPI wargame of the same name or ICE's 1984 Fellowship of the Ring. Seems easy to grasp and straight-forward until you play. The cards drive your opportunities, so you can't go into a game determined to play out a certain strategy -- you must adapt to the changing circumstances dictated by the cards in your hand. The dice determine what activities are possible in your turn -- a wonderful idea for limiting command and control potential. Very subtle, very true to the books. Lots of replay potential. Searching for this game lead to my stumbling upon BGG, for which it will always have a spot in my heart.

The war of the ring as tolkien conceived it. It is described every aspect of the war. Whenyou are playing it seems that events unfold as you were reading the books. Three drawbacks: 1) You need a very large table to occupy for more than a day if you haven't completed the game. 2) You need pills for headache. 3) You need a fair amount of time or you risk to play the game very rarely in this busy life.

It takes much to long to play.  Contrary to Descent, the time does not fly and after 2 hours of playing I am sick and tired of playing WotR.  It is annoying that quite often the regions are too small to hold all the units.  It takes too long to manouver your troops on the board and certain nations are useless.  The miniatures are great and I will keep the game just for the figures.  They may come handy when I find time to customise other games - BattleLore for example.

OK, but I am not desperate to play again. Seems quite slow moving although there was quite a lot of tension at the end as my final attacks to reach 10 as the Shadow Player looked to be faultering and it would take too long to bring up fresh armies. Seemed like too many decisions were decided by the dice not strategy. Especially the roll choice dice. Roll a bunch of Muster dice and you are, errr, mustering most of your turn.... 
Appears to take even longer to learn/teach, set up and play the second time around. Not good at all.

HIGH marks for this no holds barred treatment of Tolkiens' subject work in a game format.  The game is (in my opinion) slightly overbalanced towards Sauron; I think the more skillfull player should always take the Allies.  The graphics, miniatures and components are a visual treat, the design adequate to good.  It plays long on the average but some games resolve themselves within the course of a couple hours (with luck).

The game does a very good job of evoking its theme and there are multiple paths to victory (or defeat).  The action dice do a good job of making the game develop differently each time you play.  On the downside, the figures for the different nations can be devilishly hard to tell apart.

Anytime you license Tolkien, you've got some big expectations to fill. This game knocks it out of the park. The only reasons its not rated higher are the playing time and the fact that the 3 and 4 player rules feel like an afterthought and I'd really like to enjoy playing this with 3 or 4 players.

The theme and gameplay is very deep and engrossing, and there is much strategy to be laid here.  Playing against the hordes of Sauron really felt hopeless and impossible, which was perfect!  To face the odds as the characters did, and still somehow survive, and even win gives a great glory to the victory.  Very nice game and nice bits too.

Fun with the right person, but ultimately not what I would call a superb game.  Luck plays a significant role in the dice and card decks, but there is some room for strategy.  At first I thought the Shadow player had a slight advantage, and while this still may be true, there are enough strategies for the Free People's player to pursue that it might negate any small advantage that does exist.

RATING: 7
It's a physically big game, with tons of figures and a big board.  However, too many of the areas on the board are too small to hold more than 5 or 6 units.  The result is that you have to keep your armies off the board and use tokens instead.  Too many of the units look like each other and the ringbearer can be hard to catch if on their own.  There's nothing in the game that encourages attempts to follow the storyline from the book and it can all come down to some big battle in the middle of the board.

However, there's quite a good simple battle game here, with some very nice components.  Ignore the book and work with what you have and it's an asymmetric skirmish of puny good overcoming rampant evil.

The dice are probably the best part of the game.

Nice, if underdeveloped, Axis & Allies style game on the middle two-thirds of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings (from the departure from Rivendell to the climax at Mount Doom).  Nice components and some clever game systems promote a pleasant playing experience, but even as someone who has never read Tolkien, I found the game's narrative lacking.  The book featured climactic battles at places like Helm's Deep and Minas Tirith, but in the game the Shadow armies are so overpowered that they just walk over the Free Peoples with ease.  This isn't helped by the combat cards, whose effects largely negate the defensive bonus afforded to the Free Peoples for defending in such places.  So the end result is just a race game:  the FP heads the ring to Mordor, and the Shadow blitzkriegs Middle Earth.  Both the narrative and the gameplay would have been improved had the Shadow forces been toned down.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.7
Es largo (3-4 h) y complicado… pero no se puede esperar menos de un juego épico que sigue fiel a las novelas, pero que a su vez es muy flexible al dejar el final abierto. Juego tenso y reglas bastante liosas… No te fies: es un wargame (ligero, pero wargame)… pero no es sólo un wargame. Tiene algo de los Card Driven Games (CDG) como puede ser el uso variado de una misma carta o el concepto de “activación”.  Buena mecánica la de la “caza” y la “corrupción de Frodo”. Pegas: no es intuitivo al haber muchas excepciones en las reglas, fallo de diseño gráfico en el tablero (las miniaturas no caben en algunas regiones), algunas miniaturas se confunden. Sobreproducido. La suerte incide en este juego más que en otros. Hay que ser tolkeniano para que te guste. Sólo para 2 jugadores, para 4 es un "apaño" muy mal hecho.

Have yet to finish a game.  So far, it's pretty good!

*Update 3/29/11* Finally got through a whole game. From that single game I'd say that this one is quite a nail biter. Playing the fellowship I felt that throughout the game I was on the path to defeat and in the end found the light at the end of the tunnel. The mechanics are very well thought out and the game play gives the feel of the books, constantly desperate and wanting more but lacking the time and resources. Enjoyed this one quite a bit. The only portion that I didn't care for as much was how much luck was involved during the last few steps of the hobbits journey to mount doom (Granted it does give that wonderful feeling of suspense). Other than that, a great game.

If it weren't for the ridiculous playing time, I would be inclined to give this game a 10.  The tension and suspense is absolutely killer.  The action die system is a great idea and makes it so the game doesn't bog down into redundancy.  I'm truly surprised by the balance through playtesting the designers managed to achieve given the very, very different feels for each side.  My friend owns this and I don't mind setting aside the time every now and again, but this sort of epic really demands a lot from a person.  This is probably the single reason I won't be purchasing it (aside from finding another willing individual to commit as well).   Still don't mind giving it a glowing review though.

Update:  It's become somewhat apparent that the Fellowship needs a significant amount of luck to overcome a moderately competent shadow player.  I'll have to play a few more games to confirm my suspicions on play balance before I lower my rating.

Re-Update:  Yeah so I bought it (couldn't refuse the price I was given).  I also want to retract some of my concerns over balance.  I believe I've been strongly overvaluing rushing the Fellowship instead of breaking off companions and sticking to safe free settlement travel.  I'm really tempted to bump the rating up to a ten, but I need to see some successful Fellowship strategies first...

Truly a wonderful game, perhaps less so to gamers who don't like Tolkien much.

RATING: 10
The star of my collection, and my absolute favorite game. While not perfect, it sates my LOTR lust at the same time it provides a meaningful strategic experience. The dice and cards keep things randomized, fresh, and thematic, but theres enough planning and strategy that luck is not as big a factor as one might think. The best part, for me, is a successful Sauron player must think as one imagines Sauron thought, and the same is true for the free people. An intense marriage of form and function, theme and mechanisms, length and depth.

What constantly amazes me about 'War of the Ring', every single time, is it's perfect balance and multitude of options.

If you like playing computer games without the aid of a computer, this one is for you.  A beautiful and complex simulation of the War of the Ring, this game is not for beginners but is a delight to fans of the books who also like war games.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I'm a little ambivalent about this game.  I LOVE the theme.  The board is pretty (though has some functionality issues), and the pieces are cool.  The game play is satisfying, but not spectacular.  The game felt wide open at first, but after more than one play feels scripted to me as there really seem to be few viable strategic options to win. Rating game play alone… there are much better wargames out there to spend my time on.  However, to be fair, this game is one of the better currently existing implementations of the LOTR world in board game form.  So, if you want a LOTR wargame experience, this is a good choice.  I suspect the theme is carrying the game for many people, meaning, if it didn't have the Lord of the Rings (LOTR) theme, those same individuals would rate it lower.  Then again, maybe I'm projecting my own bias.

Update - 
I've been playing with the expansion, which fixes some of the issues I had with the base game.  I am really enjoying playing this game using the expansion, and with the expansion I rate this game an 8.

War of the Ring is presented in a very attractive way and the components are of good quality. However, the board is far from clear and the text on the cards could be larger. The military aspect of the game is rudimentary but seems to be pitched at the right level. The mechanism for simulating the advancement of the Fellowship reminds me very much of Knizia's LotR - it works quite well here, although it can be frustrating for the Fellowship Player if your plans are waylaid by a couple of unlucky tile draws. Overall the game appears to work well in combining these two aspects into a strategic framework. The cards both provide an additional layer to the game and add to the theme by introducing specific events from Tolkien's novel.

A close second to TI:3 in my eyes.  This game plays like you are recreating a story instead of just having a theme thrown onto it (a problem with some of Reiner's games in my opinion).  We have yet for the Free Peoples to win in the games I have played but I am willing to give it another go.

Editted to add: After more plays, the ratio is about 60:40 Shadow player.  I like how the game is tilted towards the Shadow player.  It should be hard for the Free Peoples to win.  Every battle should be a struggle and destroying the ring should be this side of impossible.

Editted: Back to 50-50.  Seriously, this game can be won by both sides just as much.  I totally cannot see this supposed Evil imbalance that appears from the "internet experts."

While I doubt that the power of this game will corrupt my soul and slowly warp my physical appearance, I do see what the hype is all about.  One can quibble with some of the choices in the physical production -- why or why only 2 colors of plastic?  The map is beautiful, but a little more functionality would have been nice.  The iconography has to be memorized, and is thus also less useful than something a little less stylistic and more functional.  

That said, there is a TON going on here.  I can't imagine how many games I would need to play before I was sure I had pursued all possible strategies.  But it would be easily in the dozens, maybe the hundreds.  This is not a light game, and don't even think it is particularly light for a wargame, but it is tense and seems to move fast even though it probably chalks up at 3+ hrs.  I'll be playing again, but given the playtime and setup, not as often as I would like.

If interested in WOTR, consider the following very carefully:

 - The rulebook is over 20 pages
 - The FAQ is 15 pages
 - There are 500 threads of people asking questions about the rules

Okay, still interested? 

 - It is a 2 - 4 hour game with quite a good dose of luck and yes the whole game can come down to one tile pull.

There, you should be scared off now (I know the tile pull ending sure wasn't too appealing for me). Well if not then like me you are probably LOTR obsessed or just so damn intrigued on why everyone loves this game. 

The answer is simple really, the production values are absolutely stunning and the gameplay is remarkable close to the movies/books. This realism comes at a HUGE price of complexity however and very large time investment in the beginning but WOW is it ever cool. I'm sure if not for the theme this would not make it over an 8 for me, the same rating I give Axis & Allies. 

In some ways this is very similiar to A&A for me:

 - Realism at the price of complexity
 - A lot of rules making for big time investment starting off
 - Dice for combat (luck factor)
 - Movement rules similiar
 - Attack/Retreat rules similiar
 - Longer than usual game
 - Room for different strategies
 - Very fun to play

Of course this is mostly general stuff and gameplay does feel completely different from A&A for the most part. You have all the special characters with their abilities, special cards with abilities that can usually be used every turn and in combat, dice to determine your actions, 4 different victory conditions, activation rules, etc. 

Not since A&A have I had to read the rules more than once for more than 6 hours which is why I highly recommend NOT learning this by yourself like I did, a terrible way to learn a game like this. Even DOA my fav game had less learning curve and rules. The rules do follow the law of logic thankfully and are mostly clear but I do not like how they were put together. I'm not sure that 'less would be more' here as all the details really add to the game so I think the complexity is necessary and in the end, worth it. With a nice turn summary and more play the game is starting to flow now and we are enjoying playing out the story of the ring very much. This will most likely be my 3rd "10" rating after more play but we'll see depending on replay, luck etc, could even go down a bit.

Bottom line: If you want to play out the story in 30 minutes with very little rules than LOTR-TC is your game. If you want the 'real deal' and know what you are getting into with this then the payoff should be worth it, it is a gaming masterpiece that a lot of work went into to have the WOTR come beautifully to life!

I love Tolkein and games of conflict.  I highly suspect I'd love this game.  The problem is that it would never get played.  The people I game with are generally into the shorter Euros.

RATING: 7.3
I really enjoy playing this. The comparisons being drawn to Risk, Memoir 44, and Battle Cry are all valid in a certain sense. The only reason it's not a 10 is that my Nazgul won't stand straight! The battle are primarily dice rolls with modifications from characters, cards, and the number of attackers/defenders. This is much more advanced than Risk and much better than Memoir'44 and Battle Cry. There is much more detail and the theme is very rich and brought to life with the cards and characters. I recommend this to anyone who isn't afraid of some dice rolling and who enjoys the LOTR theme. I'd say this falls in the grey catagory between Euro game and war game, with other great games such as Wallenstein and Game of Thrones though probably more on par with Axis & Allies but more advanced.

There's a zillion pieces, it takes a long time to setup... the rulebook may seem a tad heavy, but once you get going... the game is FUN.  I really enjoyed it.  The game seemed pretty balanced and our first play went down the wire where frodo perished just a step or two shy of destroying the ring.  The 'hunt' mechanic is cool and the production value is outstanding.  I would play this anytime.

Fantastic game. Took 3 days to finish it as we were learning rules and we kept on getting interrupted (my opponent had to go out to play ASL, I had birthday dinners to attend). Love it, won with a military victory and just in time too as my hobbits had 11 corruption, definitely can't last another round in Mordor. Thankfully had a Will of the West die roll and can just move in to a Sauron area that had no army cause' I just killed them the end of the previous round. Going to have a rest and start again with me playing Sauron.

This is a pretty good war game. It is hard to set up due to the miniatures and tiles looking too much a like, but the game itself is nice. I'm looking for a chance to play as the Shadow side after loosing badly as the Good side. A good portion of the loss was due to poor play on my part. Some recommendations I'd make, Get Gandolf the White and Aragon quickly as you need the extra dice. Push the quest for the ring as much as possible, early. Get your companions out on the board away from the Fellowship and doing some good in some battles.

Huge, beautiful game based on The Lord of the Rings. Will Sauron be able to conquer Middle Earth before Frodo makes it to Mt. Doom? This is a very, very good game. The usability of the components leaves something to be desired (especially for new players), and the game might have some unnecessary complexity, but it more than makes up for it in its ability to generate a convincing narrative and generally provide an entertaining gaming experience.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (April 2011)

To be perfectly honest. I don’t remember much about the game, other than the disappointment I felt when I played it. The thing is, War if the Ring was/is very well ranked and regarded and it was the favorite game of the friend who explained it to me, however, I remember I didn’t like the game very much and on 2011 I liked most games I played. Perhaps it ws over hyped.

It is too slow and too long for what it offers. Best with 2 players.

I remember I thought the game was a lot harder for the Free People player.

The game components are very well done.

Bottom line, I have changed a lot since 2011. Perhaps now I can appreciate better the game, but my desire to play it again is low so I’m not sure if I will ever play it again. If I do, I will come back to write a proper comment.

Current Rating: 5.0

Yes there's a lot of randomness, yes there's a bunch of rules (which you pick up fairly easily after playing one or two games), yes the board's too small (even though it's huge) and the pieces should have been different colors, but I love this game anyway.  There's only two sides, so there no annoying kingmaking that these types of games tend to have.  The game captures the theme so well that I don't mind that I can't roll 5's or 6's to save my life.

After just a few games, you can set-up and play this in 2-3 hrs (maybe less) as long as the Fellowship is moved aggressively.  I prefer it this way.  I would hate to play this for 4+ hours only to run into a bad sting of hunt tile draws in Mordor.

Update after more plays.  I still love how this game brings the book to life in it's mechanics.  The FP need to move aggressively to have a chance at winning.  We can now set-up and play in about 1.5 hours.

A great strategy boardgame in Tolkien's world. Every game is different, the game is faithful to the theme of the books, game balance is near-perfect and the strategic options are wide. The game does an awesome job of transmitting Tolkien's world to the players. Being a Tolkien fan helps - my rating would be 1-2 points lower if I wasn't one - but is not compulsory. This is a good game for anybody interested in getting an asymmetric wargame that is still perfectly balanced, and which varies a great deal from one play to another. The single downside is having to know the rules pretty well in order to enjoy the game - but it is really worth it (complexity is the only thing that keeps this game from being a full 10 in my books - it does turn some people off, and therefore makes the times I'm able to enjoy this game not as numerous as I'd hope).

UPDATE 8-2010: I got the CE version and have incorporated it into my plays. I'm using my own painted miniatures from this set along with minis from the CE that I didn't have (touched them up to meet my specs). We play with my "Starting From The Shire" Variant or my "Army Game" Variant for fast plays. Now I've updated my "3-Player" game with the CE expansion of the Dunlendings making it perfect as Saruman now has a large army at his disposal to be an equal part of the game as I didn't like him controlling the Far Easterlings (the Sauron Player now does). The large map/cards/tokens from the CE are invaluable and going to good use. I also added forts/towns/cities/strongholds pieces from History of the World which work perfectly in this game. The final piece for my pimped game was a miniature Mt. Doom for the FSP to climb. I've now got my ULTIMATE WOTR game I've always wanted.
UPDATE: I've split plays between this and the CE edition. I've made this a "Travelling Edition" to take places I don't care to take the CE to.

Played only 1 "learning game" as the free people.  We messed up an important rule (I don't blame the writer of the rulebook, only us players) which skewed the results a lot.

Beautiful and entertaining game; however, I don't feel that the journey of the Fellowship and the tactical war portion of the game combine well.

RATING: 10
Stunning, epic affair that captures the Lord of the Rings theme in a manner I doubt anyone imagined could be done. The Shadow's military might and action dice advantage (which can be swiftly increased by bringing out Saruman) are set against the Free People's resiliency to sieges and, of course, the Fellowship's movement towards Mordor. The action cards lend a wonderful boost to each game's unique story arc and can spring a number of nasty surprises on an opponent in regular play or when used for combat effects. 

There are some issues: the map is a drab, disappointing reddish-brown with weird symbology for VP spaces and three different settlement icons that can be tough to distinguish. Nation borders are tricky in spots, too. The action card text is almost impossibly small in many cases, bordering on microsopic. The Free figures can look a bit samey, but I ended up painting the bases of mine to lend a hand visually. The rules as written are a catastrophe and result in many people playing key rules wrong the first few times out--definitely print out a player aid or two from this site. 

Fortunately, none of those things come anywhere close to knocking this down from a flat-out perfect 10. A game I will never, ever turn down.

After several plays, I still give this game a high rating.  Different strategies as impacted by the random flow of the cards give high replay value.  Many games have come down to the wire.

Where to begin?  Great board, theme, design, everything.  Rich rich rich theme.  Addictive and, to a large extent, unique - the mechanics have not really been copied anywhere, and they work extremely well.  This is NOT just Risk with LOTR pasted over - people who claim this have clearly never played the game (plus Risk is essentially a negotiation game and this is not).  Once you know the rules it flows well and plays fast - the game will seem to finish quickly!  Only gripe is that luck plays a bit too big of a role, in the sense that there are often key moments where a single good/bad dice roll or card draw will heavily influence the outcome.  But there IS strategy and the better player will win more often.  I will still play many more times because it is no doubt a very fun game.

Wonderful simple game-mechanic solutions to translate thematic material into a game. (Like the elfen-rings giving advantage to the free people, but upon using giving later advantage to Sauron.) Rules (I read in dutch) badly translated and leave open many questions. Map beautiful but difficult to use. (As has been said before.) But the game addictive and every time different. A masterpiece.

RATING: 7
War of the Ring is a fantastic wargame that offers some additional aspects that make for a very interesting game experience. The theme is brilliant. Dividing your attention between the Ringbearer and the war of Middle-Earth is always hard. The luck in rolling dice and drawing cards is minimal, because there are multiple ways to combine the dice and cards to play out your strategy. The hunt for the ring is always exciting and is very cleverly done. I love it; too bad it takes a long time to set up and play. Also, the game is incredibly fiddly with all the miniatures, the tokens that replace miniatures, and why do the Nazgul keep topling over? Sold my copy, because I want to invest my WotR time in playing Twilight Struggle.

RATING: 7
A very chaotic design where players are often managing events rather than initiating strategies.  Opportunity knocks often and loudly in this game, requiring players to put their carefully made plans aside to take advantage of windfalls in the cards and action dice.  It's a fairly interesting ride, though I suspect I'd find the Free Peoples much more dull than playing Sauron and friends.

RATING: 6
While it captures the feel of the books/movies and seems to have a nice narrative to it (makes you feel like you are writing your own version of the story while playing it), I feel the dice system seems to slow this game down way too much. Your actions are determined by the roll of the dice which bogs down your strategy. It can take a while for reinforements to come in needlessly. I feel if you take away the dice and implement an action system, the game would play out quicker (takes too long as it is) and give you more control over your strategy without taking away from the thematic feel of the game. Also has a long set up time. But there are very good game mechanics there that capture the theme of the stories.

RATING: 6
After playing Middle-Earth-Quest I downgraded this game to 6/10 as in direct comparison I rather play MEQ for a Tolkien fix as it is more approachable and plays more relaxing.
---
Contrary to the stats here on the geek, the Free People won in my first two games. In the second game we were able to shorten the playing time from 5 to 4 hours. The easy way to spoil the game is to read and execute the available strategy guides. If you just neglect these, there should be enough possiblities for the average gamer (i.e. somebody playing this every once in a while with months in between) to never get fed up with this game.
Don't play this game with non-gamers. They likely won't get it. The game is too open which will stall their decisions. 6.5 hard hours were enough lesson to me. Game ended with corruption victory of Sauron.
After my second four-player-game I think I enjoy this more with four than only with two players. On the other side, I enjoy this game a huge bit less as a whole because of two fucking die rolls messing up the win after five hours (chances for the result which led to the loss were 1:81!!!).

RATING: 7
Juego de estrategia sobre la guerra del anillo. Aunque el setup es fijo ofrece muchas posibilidades de estrategias distintas. Algunas mecánicas me recuerdan a Twilight Struggle. Por ejemplo es necesario conocer las cartas del rival para planear la estrategia.

UPDATE: Me he hecho con el kit de upgrade de la 2ª edición.

UPDATE: Reduzco la nota a 7 porque siempre resulta anticlimático que el jugador de los pueblos libres se la juegue en la corrupción cuando la sombra amenaza por ganar por conquista. Esto reduce las opciones de la sombra a forzar la conquista más o menos rápido y hace que ese bando sea menos divertido de jugar.

I really wanted to like this game. But...I sold it on Ebay after 3 plays. I'm a huge Tolkien fan but this game is too controlled by the story line. Get the Fellowship to Mt Doom, Sauron tries to stop them or take over enough cities/towns to win first. Repetitive and got dull. My gaming pals wanted to ditch the fellowship and just have battles in Middle-Earth. Also, the cards you draw determines which fellowship characters will go where. Clear rules, great game pieces, lovely board, but I just couldn't get into it.

RATING: 7
Having only played the introductory game, I consider my rating to be very volatile at this point, but likely to move up.  I wouldn't want to play this all the time, but it is definitely quite fun.  I'm not a Tolkien expert, but the game has a lot of the flavor of the story and feels very thematic.  There is a pretty big learning curve that I have yet to fully conquer.  The shortcomings of the game all have to do with appearance.  The map is confusing, having to scour the board to find things, or distinguish between towns and cities.  The pieces are fine I guess (I'm no fantasy fan), but the Nazguls tend to fall over quite easily, and they're too big for the space they're supposed to occupy.  The cards could be designed much better as well, for easier readability.  However, that said, I enjoy the game and look forward to becoming more familiar with it.

Traded away - just too many rules to realistically expect to play it that much.

RATING: 2
Difficult to get through all the rules and dozens of little things to forget. Long playing time and progress feels minimal since units move so slow. Heroes pretty much all do the same with a slight benefit to their own kind. Lots of units are in bad positions and do nothing the whole game. Mt. Doom is way to hard. 

Battles feel way to simplistic, leaving the player with a 'that's it?' feeling. Seems like a [b]over-glorified Risk with an annoying ring journey aspect.[/b] Hard to distinguish the units and borders. Very easy to overlook cities and towns. At least the dice are pretty.

RATING: 9
Fantastic reenactment of Lord of the Rings. Much tenseness and decisions to make each round. The Sauron player gets the satisfaction of watching his minions tear apart Middle Earth, while the Fellowship player can plot and plan his way into Mordor.

An extremely streamlined combat system that caters for many different factions makes this really easy to play and the different minis for each faction really sells the game.

Poor game. Lacks streamlining. Board is difficult to read. The fiddliness doesn't add choice or variety. A dicefest with great reliance on luck. Drawn cards are regularly useless (50% +). Overall very frustrating and quite a missed opportunity. A game in inner turmoil over being complex (RPG-ey) and simple (Risk-like) ends up getting the worst of both worlds.

I have played once. Our game lasted for 4 hours, but somehow it didn't feel like that long. The game was really tight all the way to the end. Everything seemed to be in balance and the decisions got harder as the game went on. The map and all the pieces also look really good and the miniatures are easily distinguishable from each other. Cons are that a system that uses a lot of dice can lead to frustration and there is not enough room on the map for all the troops.

Combines light military strategy with the Quest to destroy or recover the One Ring, depending on the side you're playing. Simple and good battle resolution, with story elements to add flavour, options, and variability. Seems to work well. Both sides have a good chance of winning.

A very solid game with a lot of flavor.  The rulebook is very poorly organized and the Event cards, while injecting a lot of excitement in the game, are occasionally fiddly.  The game gently shepherds the players along the path followed by the actual parties in the books, but offers enough opportunity for creativity to create plausible and interesting alternative histories.  For me, it falls short of a couple of the criterion for a "perfect" Tolkien game -- for one, the hunt (while a great mechanic) is passive rather than active.  I have a few other quibbles like this, but mostly, I think it's a very solid game.

No longer considered for trade.  Finally got to play a couple of games and BOY! was I foolish for letting it take so long!
An excellent game; just superb in all aspects.  Quality of components, theme, strategy/choices, tactics, balance (with added expansion) and fun factor!
Only gets a small notch off of perfect for being 2 player only and the rules are a bear to get through and minutia laden.
Still an absolute must for fans of LotR, wargames with some real choices and strategy (but still a dice-fest for the AT lovers!) and gamers in general.
Runs about 4 hours still while rules are learned, so that may hold some back...not me, but some.

RATING: 7
Rated on the basis of one very long game. I enjoyed it a lot, and the thought and effort that went into balancing it yielded good results: when I played, I was Sauron and my friend was on *the last space* of the Crack of Doom when I managed to increase his corruption enough to win. The entire game came down to a roll of the die: 1-3, he won, 4-6 I did. I rolled a 6. Insane! And also a little annoying. It made me feel like I could've flipped a coin and saved myself eight hours. But then again, the production value is so high that the game was well worth it. Unlike a lot of more schematic Tolkien games, you aren't following the story exactly, but creating the War of the Ring as you go. The game leans toward conquest of Rohan and Gondor, but they aren't necessary, and there are plenty of ways the Eye can win by, for example, attacking to the north, or by sitting back, not mustering much at all, and hunting for the Ring. The range of choices you have per turn is satisfying, and the action dice introduce enough randomness that you will always get PART of what you want to do, but rarely will you get the exact results that you need. I really like this game, and I'm curious to see over the next few plays how much strategy has to do with the outcome. [ETA: Played again, this time as Free Peoples; got trounced. So much for too much balance!]

Yet another update. I'm rerating this from 9 to 7 just because I've played it so much I'm sick to death of it. I still think it's phenomenally well balanced and designed, but there are a fair number of fiddly rules to keep track of and a lot of winning strategies. The trick is to figure out which route your opponent is going to take, and optimize your own strategy to take advantage. Is Sauron sending all his Nazgul to Minas Tirith? Then start moving Frodo and the gang. Is Saruman in the game early? Then get Aragorn or Gandalf down to Rohan and try to hold the line, getting the Shadow to spend dice. So much of the game is a defensive maneuver for the Free Peoples. One thing I did wrong my first three or four games of this was to underestimate the power of splitting off Fellowship members to accelerate movement on the diplo track.

As of this review, I've only played this game 1.75 times (the 0.75 being a learning game that we didn't have time to finish and was hampered by numerous rule difficulties).My first impressions, however, are that this game captures the global theme of LOTR brilliantly, from the various battles of Middle Earth to the quest of the ringbearers. The rules are complex, and take some getting used to, but the mechanics and theme combined to make my limited experiences with the game stand out. If time weren't an obstacle, this would get played A LOT.

This seems to be a very well put together game, lots of thought went into the details. I played the free peoples, and I think I came pretty close to chucking the ring in.

April, 2013 - Finally got to play this!  I really enjoyed myself.  Despite my lack of knowledge on how to play, I was competitive.  I got the ring bearers to the victory space, just to lose on the final draw from the bag.

I see how I could have done many things more effectively, and I would enjoy another go at this nicely thematic game.  But I can also better understand how some people express concern about how this game might play similarly each time.

But then again, I found several fun things to try.  In our game I saw a very different sequence of events happen with Rohan and Gondor than "history".  This was interesting and entertaining.

I'll never be so enticed by this game to consider getting the collector's edition.  I amy not even buy a regular edition, as I doubt I would ever play it much.  But I am glad I played, and can see the allure of playing more.

At first I was a bit overwhelmed by the options available -- should we try and move the fellowship right away, try and mobilise the passive nations and when to separate the companions from the ringbearer. I misshandled the last one in a major way, which led to the free people trying for a military victory. It worked, as the shadow had overrecruited and was unable to muster in south harad to prevent us from grabbing the last city. Not a thing one would do again.In short -- seems to provide ample choice of strategies, variation in that cards have to be used in combat and are really circumstantial as to which get get played for the event, and a touch of wonder in that you really are along for the ride in your first game, over your head, that is.Looking forward to playing again, it remains to be seen if I have gained any wisdom from my brief excursion into middle earth. At least it seems more likely to hit the table than my copy of the SPI game ;)

Played 4 times so far, would play more but for the fact it takes 5 hours or so!!! Love the different mechanics, love the theme, like the board but needs more definition of regions etc, love the miniatures,(except that they should be coloured by army/force) love the dice, would love the cards but for the small print on them; luckily both my girlfriend and I have  20/20 vision!!! I think if played more and got used to board regions, army differences as in the miniatures and available cards and their effects this could be a real nice strategic game... but would it then become boring???

RATING: 8
A beautiful and efficient game that captures the grand storyline of the Lord of the Rings very well.  The two sides are very asymmetric, but are extremely true to their literary analogs.  This leads to players having to understand their strengths and weaknesses, and then making informed choices about how to use them.  The action dice mechanic is very cool, and does a nice job of abstracting the fact that not every choice is available exactly when you need it.  I want to play this more and more to better explore the system and its options!

It's hard to find games with a better marriage of theme to game play.  There's a lot of up-front investment in learning the game play, but once you get ramped up it runs pretty quickly and smoothly.  I know a lot of people prefer the second edition to the first, but aside from the small rules changes in the second I like this edition.  The map is more Tolkien-esque, and I personally love the tall imposing figures of the Nazgul, even if they are a little prone to tipping over.

This is a good game with a system that is easy to learn with just the right level of complexity.  A "Risk" like game, but takes the basic idea further with action cards and event dice.

I would like the game more if the plastic figures were limited to characters only and the armies were counters. Too many plastic figures just cause clutter.

War of the Ring is, by far, the most immersive game I've played: every mechanism is there so that you can recreate and/or rewrite the Lord of the Rings history. If you like the films you should give it a try, but if you consider yourself a fan of LotR and haven't played it yet, put it in the first place of your "to do" list.

The game itself is quite a challenge: both sides are completely different and, not only require a different strategies, but also offer completely different game experiences. 

As the free peoples you see how armies of orcs start to gather and crush everything that gets in their way. You can't stop them, but you have to do your best to slow them as much as possible. Your focus is on buying Frodo and his ever-shrinking fellowship enough time to reach mount doom and destroy the ring.

As the shadow armies you feel completely overpowered: you have enough power and brute force to crush everything that gets in your way. You have the potential of crushing everything, but... Will you stomp your foes fast enough? How much will you focus on pure stompin' and how much will you focus on catching those pesky hobbits?

Regarding tactics and strategy, luck has its impact, but it can be controlled. On the one hand, each card has two actions, and can be used either in combat or to get some sort of benefit in the board positioning. The more chrome-heavy actions are usually tagged along with ones of general use, so it's weird for a card to feel useless. On the other hand, some people complain that the game is too centred on dice, as in a game as thematic as this one, dice do add a lot of tension and drama.

All in all, a perfect game for hardcore Tolkien fans, as well as for those who simply enjoy the films and like highly thematic games.

RATING: 3
Two-player wargame. Needlessly complicated rulebook and although the miniatures are nice, the difference between the different races is barely noticeable (why no different colors?). Basically an advanced Risk where everything is dictated by dice (dice for the actions you can take during a turn and dice for combat - don't really mind the last, but having the possible actions detemined by dice can be very frustrating). All in all, this is an epic game which takes ages to finish and gets tedious after a while. So, I'd rather spend that time watching the three extended DVD's of Lord of the Rings (again :-)).

It is a very nice game. It's complex, probably to complex, because players can be easily overwhelmed by rules, but playing gives a lot of fun.

The concept of two-area conflict is very good. One of the areas is military, the second is quest for the Ring. The Shadow player is military crushing, but he has only limited time to destroy the Free People player and he must divide his attention to the Fellowship as well. Very, very nice.

The only huge drawback of the game is, as in all FF games, the randomizes both in battles and, especially, at the final stage of the Quest. Because of the separate decks it is not inconvenient in card arrangement.

I could comment the game flow using only one sentence: "We are playing and after that we are drawing 5 tiles to see is the winner..."

Fantastically detailed and lovingly crafted, from art to cards to miniatures. Brave attempt to recreate the LotR Middle Earth setting from the micro to the macro largely succeeds, but also has a few tricky rules and exceptions. Long playing time and extensive setup prevents this from being a truly remarkable game, but very good in its own right, and certainly stands out from most other attempts at epic scale fantasy war.

Awesome how the game makes you write an alternative history. Fun battle system. Beautiful map and miniatures. Rules are complex but not as much as they're made out to be; it may seem too much because the rule book is very detailed, specifying things that in other games you'd have to find in a FAQ. Still some things could be a bit less complex. Main complaint: duration of 6 hours. Also, don't expect a balanced wargame; the Shadow player is much stronger (but needs more conquests to win).

"Choke of the Year Award - War of the Ring - After the initial modest disappointment with the weak theming and somewhat unwieldy rules given the lack of detail, early plays of this game were still fairly promising. But no, it turns out this is mostly a railroad job after all without anything in the way of either serious strategic options, interesting tactical detail, or player flexibility. A disappointment because the system of dice and cards is pretty reasonable, and the first few games are fun to play as you explore the options. But it seems once that exploration process is over, so is most of the enjoyment of the game."

The rules are written well but the organization is frustrating. Without a glossary or quick 'term' reference sheet first time games can be slow as syrup! It is a wonderful concept with a full scale board and many many elements to keep track of. Be patient and play it through a few times. Take advantage of the quick reference player aids made here and hopefully if a second edition comes out there will be better guides and aids to walk you through the small little rules that have to be kept track of.

I'm pretty close to giving up on this game.  I'll give it another try or two, but most of the people I've played it with haven't wanted to play it again.

I don't mind having to deal with adversity, but it seems like there's a little [i]too[/i] much of that here.  In my last play, I decided I wanted to try to run the fellowship as fast as possible, and then had turns where I rolled all helmets when there was one die in the hunt pool, and all swords when there were four or five dice in the pool.  Shrug... OK, game, why don't [i]you[/i] play, and let me know how it went.

I'm not crazy about the effects of the cards; they feel gamey & unrealistic to me.  Maybe I'd like it better if there were ways for the opponent to cancel events as they were played, so that they were less of a sure thing?  Knowing that the Dead Men of Dunharrow will show up if you get Strider across the continent may help you recreate the books, but from the point of view of the fellowship or the leaders in the game, what does it mean to be holding that card in your hand?  "Ooh, if I have a Hobbit in a battle, I'll get this bonus"--nobody in the game world would think that.  (Compare to something like "if I move troops to this region, maybe I can slow the enemy's advance.")  Similarly, the choice between the event and the combat effect on most cards is not one which would ever face a participant in the war.

I really hate the rulebook, both for the irrelevant blather which just gets in the way when you're looking for a rule--put that in a sidebar, people!--and for how often the rule you're looking for is four pages away from where you expect to find it.

Update: traded to MScrivner 2/26/08.

Just one play behind 4-player. The game is random enough for being this long already, and with two Shadow Peoples "factions" you have somewhat limited info with the SP side's event cards. But I see a lot of comments about the game being lopsided to the SP so maybe 2 SP players works as a fix.
The theme is implemented nicely, but the game pretty much goes on rails. There's no real incentive for the Free Peoples player to go for the conquest victory, and the SP has to get very very lucky to win by corruption. So the strategies are quite set from the beginning, and the tactical options are quite dictated by the action dice and card draws. While pretty lukewarm, I want to try it again. If it would settle down to less than 2 hours with further plays, it could be an ok beer and pretzels distraction every once in a while.

[2008.Feb.10] A solid offering by Fantasy Flight Games. This game has considerable depth and thus, does breathe life to Tolkien's Middle Earth. However, with more plastic than a Tupperware Party, there are almost too many details to worry about while playing this game; it really is hard to keep track of all of your potential options.

RATING: 8
I like how this game seems to stay true to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It is almost impossible for the free peoples to win with a military victory, and I like the fellowship component of the game. Thats not to say the game is scripted, because I don't feel that it is - but for a simulation of the events in the LotR trilogy, War of the Ring does a damn fine job.

It's interesting to see how little dice the Shadow player allocates to the hunt early on, only to see him allocating as many as possible when the Ringbearers get too close to Mt. Doom.

I enjoy the suspense of the game when the fellowship makes it to the Mt. Doom track.

Likewise the battles at key points such as Minas Tirith and Helms Deep are exciting, and the Free Peoples player has his work cut out for him.

Part of the appeal of this game for me is really the content, or the theme of the game, however, I find that the mechanics of the game work perfectly to compliment the theme and to recreate, in boardgame form, the dual struggle of the War of the Ring and the quest to destroy the actual One Ring.

This is an example where the theme of the game combined with excellent mechanics makes for a very satisfying game.

The more think about it the more I enjoy this game and come to appreciate it. I think this is probably the definitive LotR game.

The rulebook could be clearer - and I think the "Hunt" should be included earlier in the rulebook then where it is (at the end) because really I think it is the most important part of the game.

My most recent play confirms that I don't care for the rulebook, as it's still hard for me to pinpoint a specific rule, but i'm getting better.

This is one of those rare "epic" battle games that really captures the spirit of the LoTR.  The game definitely has a learning curve to it!  Be warned when first playing.

When I'm in the mood for a long 2 player game, this one rocks.  Compares very favorably with a slightly similar predecessor, the SPI version of same name, which I still have and vaguely recall playing as a high schooler.  This is truly excellent and fits the "2-plyr deep strategy" game category with a bit of a learning curve.  But, once you've got a decent understanding of it and get underway, it's a lotta fun.  If you have an appetite for fantasy, this is a gem of a game.  The theme is as close to Tolkien as you could possibly get with a boardgame.

Very thematic and immersive game which is quite compelling in the story arc of the game.  There are many times the Free Peoples will feel overwhelmed by the forces of Sauron and wonder if there is really any hope and then find hope in the Fellowship as they slowly make their way up Mt. Doom.  There is difficulty in discerning who is who with some of the figures.  I wish they would have some marked bases to help differentiate between the different Free People nations in particular.  There is also not nearly enough space on the map in certain regions but there are counters made available to replace the plastic figures in those situations.  I do also think how they differentiated between elite and regular troops is quite clever as there are interesting decisions in some instances of what dies in battle...elite units live longer, but provide the same attack value as a regular.  The Nazguls constantly tripping over themselves was bothersome, but I must admit the sculpts were impressive and stand out on the board.  Dice were sweet as well.  Not sure why they didn't include 10 d6s for combat?..unless my copy was just shorted five dice.  First game will take a while and most likely I expect I would need to play several times to truly grok the game.  I think I would prefer to keep this two player, but 3-4 player brings in some other interesting decisions/difficulties.

Italian view on the Middle Earth.  The box is huge!  Wanting to play this game someday while not wanting to own it. There will probably a reprint in the future as the game is already OOP.  

The game is almost a perfect combination of traditional boardwargaming with miniatures - minus some of the areas with insufficient space which are not able to hold all the miniatures in one place when they move in to conquer the area.  Nonetheless, War of the Ring is the closest thing I have ever seen for simulating the story Lord of the Ring.    

We have a 4-player game but it seems to me 3-players game is the best as the Free Peoples can be controlled by the same person while the side has fewer action tiles than the Shadow Armies in a game turn.

For Tolkein's fans, the map is the most gorgeous thing one could probably dream of having to realize.  All the Middle Earth geography, names of regions and places are included on the map - a kind of authentic research into the Tolkien's world.  Although I am much less enthusiastic of the miniatures and figures, they do convey a visualization of being in Middle Earth reminiscent of the dark trilogy movies.  Overall, the game associates with the theme of the story very closely and it is not surprising to see it has a very high ranking in BGG with regards to theme. 

Before going to the good sides of the many game features I like, there are two minor quibbles.  The first is the size of the Event Card text is way too small...even for good eyes like me.  Many of the game rules and dependent variables require the reading of the cards often and the effects of the cards can be quite significant - whether a nation would join the war or raise new troops.  

The second thing is the some of the area size on the map are not sufficient enough to hold the maximum stacking of 10 units.  While the figurines are finely diecut and they look really lively and authentic to the description as was told by the book and the movie, particularly Nazgul the flying bombers, they appears to be crammed in a small cage shouting out for help. Well, I shouldn't be that picky as the map has to tell the Middle Earth in proportion, before you remember every small places or regions in the world.

Back to the game features, the Fellowship has a Guide when the Companions start with them.  The Companion may leave the group and go back to the home country to raise troops.  The Free People are in need of them AND they are in real short supply....while stock still lasts.  A Free People unit, when eliminated, is never able to recover to return.  The Shadow Army, however, can always raise as many troops as reinforcements from the dead pool.  Talking about the difference between walking dead and human flesh and blood.

The entire game system is designed based on the Action Dieroll. There are six different types of  actions. In the beginning of the game, each side will roll the action dices - the Free People have 4 but the Shadow Army have 7 (both can be increased to a certain extent upon entering of some characters).  What the dieroll turns up will dictate largely the kind of actions each side can do.  For example, to recruit new troops as mentioned above, you need a "Muster" dieroll.  To perform an action, you spend a die with the corresponding side up.  So the Free People is really restricted in resources while the Shadow Army is powerful to perform a lot of the actions and with more flexibility in strategy.

The Army (with or without Character leader) can move to the adjacent region one at a time. Two armies are activated to move with a banner while a single army with a Character is activated with a sword.  The sword dieroll can also move ALL (remember, it is all) companions Character not in the Fellowship or to move the Fellowship itself.  The Shadow player can move ALL Nazgul and Minions with this dieroll.  It creates the situation that the Companions should leave at the right time and go calling for help.  In a four player game, although the two players control units of some of the Nations only, they can actually move all the individual companions or Nazgul and Minions.  

I like the simplicity of the combat system where the number of combat dices is determined by the number of units in the Army, plus the number of possible dieroll due to the presence of leaders.  Each dieroll scores a hit on a 5 or 6. Combat cards and Characters special abilities can modify the number of dieroll via combat strength and leadership rating.  The attacker declares whether he is going to use a card first and then the defender.  The cards effects are resolved simultaneously though.  There is a good variety of cards text and effect.  They are pretty good at relating the events in the novel to the game in gaming terms.  I really like how the designer handles the card management aspect.  For each hit, it is satisfied by removing one Regular Unit or replace one Elite Unit with one Regular Unit.  So it means the Elite Units has two steps to hit. But then, an Elite Unit only grant you the same one combat die as a Regular Unit. The attacker can keep on attacking until he chooses to stop or the defender elects to retreat.  

Defending Units can retreat into an adjacent region or retreating into a stronghold if there is one in the embattled region.  A siege of the stronghold would start.  The attacker only hit on a 6 while the besieged hits on a 5 or 6.  The attacker can continue another round of siege only if he reduces an Elite Unit into a regular one.  Simple and effective siege rules.

No rule is complete in a game based on the Lord of the Ring if there is nothing about the "Ring" and the hunt for it.  The "Fellowship" comprised basically of Frodo and Sam.  They are bent on reaching Mount Doom to complete the "quest".  The Companions can stay with the group or leave to raise more Free People troops.  The Fellowship can be "hidden" until it is revealed by the hunt or declared by the Free People player (in order to get healed in a city or stronghold).  The Fellowship counter on the map is only an indication of its last known position.  When the Free People player uses a Character die to advance the counter on the Fellowship Progress Track, the Fellowship counter itself doesn't move.  The number on the track just means how far did the Fellowship travel. You count the number on the track from the last know position to an area that the Fellowship can reach.  This simple game mechanic really conveys the whole story atmosphere of hide and seek of the Fellowship effectively.

This is not a gateway game, play it only when you have read the rules at least 2-3 times. After that try to play some test games before playing for real. The learning curve makes you realize the greatness of the game.

Had a chance to play at Origins '04 - 4 players as two co-operative teams. Played out in just about 4 hours. Forces of Good (Ben & I) suffered the fate of corruption with 3 spaces to go to destroy the nasty Ring. Many options, difficult choices (use of action dice and cards). Nice blend to cover the game. Two small issues: forces of good (minis) are a bit hard to distinguish amongst races and I hope the final version cards have somewhat larger font. Game generated tremendous walk by interest. Thanks Erik for GMing for us. No question about buying it...

I've played the basic game once, and that's not even close to enough for a fair rating. That said, my expectations going in are that WotR will settle in somewhere between 5 and 7, though I maintain an open mind.

Critics who say that this is just Risk dressed up in Tolkien clothes aren't being fair, though. For one thing, that game actually exists, and I have played it. The combat system in WotR is a marked improvement over Risk, as are the victory conditions.

Finally, three years after buying it, we get around to working out how to play it. And after one play, well, I can understand the advantage of owning the Collector's Edition. The rules for my edition are poorly laid out, the font on the cards is so small as to be almost illegible, and the nazgul kept falling over as soon as you tried to stack them on top of counters. A difficult mission, to say the least. A break is certainly needed before anyone will feel like tackling this again.

I can't quite understand why the different nations pieces weren't color-coded to match their borders (like many other games - Axis and Allies did this 20 YEARS AGO!) I also find it hard to distinguish some features and locations when the board gets crowded. On the plus side, this game is a LOTR fan's dream (if you dig deep strategy, or sometimes even if you don't) and even though there is a random nature given to it by the dice, the abilities the characters and minions add and the cards give make the game level out in terms of luck. What would a war game be without some luck in it? It is obviously not made for casual gamers, Grognards (for the most part), or perhaps even Spielfreaks; However, for those who seek a moderate war game with a fantastic theme and have the patience to play a 2-3 hour game, none will be disappointed. I like this game alot and look forward to many future plays.

There's a lot happening for this game, and I respect everything it set out to do.  Theme-wise, it has come second only to Confrontation for Tolkien games.  The action dice system is one of the best parts; every other dice mechanic it has (read: combat) is what kills this game.  Bah.  Still, a good time and a better spectator sport.

RATING: 8.25
Game is so thematic and theatrical, while at the same time being a battle of efficiency and well-timed battles.  Read the rules before playing (that took about 2 hours), then played one game (as the good guys).  Took us 9+ hours with two people!!  I don't know how anyone can play this in less than 4 hours.  Worth the trouble of set-up and wading through the poorly organized rules.

UPDATE: Played again as the Free Peoples, and this time we cut the game down to 6 hours.  Rating went from an 8 to 7.75, because I can now imagine situations where I'd turn-down a play of it.  Seems a better system for distributing the shuffled cards --- like dividing the deck into logical thirds, would reduce some of the calamities that slow the game down.

SECOND UPDATE: Rating back up, this time to 8.5, as I'm dying to play it again.  This time as the Shadow forces.  Me and my gaming opponent's third game of this, and we were STILL making rules errors (mostly forgetting the exceptions to the exceptions).  Took approx. 6 hours again, with a very loss on the part of the Free Peoples.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.4
The game mechanics portray very well Sauron's constant dilemma of "Search for the Ring now or fight the war?  Search for the Ring now or fight the war?", and the Good Guys' experience of "The bad guys outnumber us, but I have to accept this grinding series of defeats, because if I just give up, Sauron will be able to give his full attention to catching Frodo." .  

The plastic figures are attractively detailed, and there are almost two dozen different kinds, plus about a dozen more individual-character figures.  The map-board is pretty, especially to fans of the book.  

There is a simpler introductory game, and a full-rule-set version, marked chiefly by the addition of a lot of event cards (to let the players do particular things that happened in the novel), and more detailed (and more satisfying) hunt-for-the-ringbearer rules.  

I would say the full game rules will satisfy a deep [I]Lord of the Rings[/I]-geek—and only such a person would have the patience to learn them!  ;)

Interesting epic battle with a strong thematic feel. Setup is fiddly and rules/special cards take a little while to understand. After that the game mechanics aren't bad and the turns go by quickly.

I'm a LotR fan but this game is only a '6' for me. There are too much negative points: 1. Without Internet help a lot of rule questions could not be answered. These chaos rules need to be 'streamlined' and completely rewritten. 2. Beautiful but for the gameplay totally impractical plastic bits. Far too big. 3. You have to paint the army bits and glue a coin under the Nazguls. 4. Luck plays a big part: Cards and dice are an important part of the game engine. 5. Nice board but once again impractical. What I like: You usually wanna make more moves than you have. Conclusion: If you wanna have a card driven dice luck fantasy game then take BattleLore. It has different board layouts and less playing time.

Wargame for 2. 
"Action dice" are a nice mix between limitations and freedoms (because the same symbol may be used in different ways and several actions may be accomplished with more than a symbol).
Asymmetrical (different cards, objectives, some rules, etc.) but balanced.
Luck is present (a lot), but can be partially managed. The most disappointing part is how much impact the (incontrollable) last turns (the "Mordor track") has on the final outcome.
Good replay value.
Nice flavor.
Poorly organized rulebook.
Excellent bits.

Slugged through the complete rules the other night and played the full game.  People are right, play the full game and forget about the quickstart basic game.  Great game, very enjoyable.  Long but worth it.  FP cast the ring into Mount Doom.  I underestimated the hunt dice.  Don't forget to add dice to the hunt pool quite often!  Though, I did completely crush Gondor militarily.  The game did hold very close to the storyline which I liked.  I thought the Nazgul should have more powers than the simple leader powers that all leaders had.  Just my 2 cents.

3-12-08 - Upped it to 9 from 8.5 after several plays.  Excellent game system here!

This game is even better when you realize how truly awful it could have been!  Issues with game components aside (a lot of playability was sacrificed for beauty) this game is an amazing blend of strategy and escapism.  The first time I led Sam & Frodo into Mordor I got got goose-bumps!

Edit:  The previous review was written shortly after my second play.  That was over a year and half ago and i have yet to play it again.  Nor do I really want to.  A really short trip from "Wow!" to "meh."

This game has an amazing theme and some good mechanics. However, the game is burdened by excessive rules: prepare for  a 40+ pages rule book, cards that can only be played under very specific circumstances (if faction x attacks you at location b after y, you can play this card), and printing player aids. If none of this deters you at all, you'll probably love this game. If you want a game that you can more or less grasp after your first play, this is not for you. I don't think this game has more depth than other heavier games like Imperial 2030 or Carson City, but it's a less elegant in it's design.

During my first play of the game it was me versus the game's owner who had played the game way to many times.  I was the fellowship and managed to get Frodo to the second step of Mt. Doom before I lost the game. Basically I think I did well my first game.

I thought the game captured the tension of the Lord of The Rings quite well.

Interesting blend of War and Euro game.  Rule book and FAQ's must be read thoroughly before you try to play, but the overall game is not difficult, there are just many rules to cover off all required facets.

Based on one play:  Somewhat too long, seemed like there were too few choices, and combat was incredibly simplistic.  I don't know.  That said, the first hour or so was really fun.  Too much of the game, I suspect, is wanting the correct dice to come up and trying to memorize cards.  So I don't know if my opinion of it will go up much.  One of my friends, whose opinions normally find similar to mine (and thus respect), has played it apparently 50 times. I am very curious to try the expansion and its variations.

RATING: 9
Rating after five plays.  I like the game.  The theme is excellent, the tense decisions make it fun to play.  Sort of feels like a Twilight Struggle/Queen's Gambit combination, but much longer and with more rules.  Since those are two of my highest rated games, that is praise.  Has to played on the weekend for me, not a big deal.  The map is too small to handle the figures, the card type is very challenging even with my reading glasses (gramps!).  The rating may very well go up as I like games with some random elements and very tough decisions.  Oh, and since I don't paint, the figures are probably my biggest negative - a shame they weren't in different colors.  If someone gets a spare copy of the collector's edition they want to give to grandpa, I'd be mighty grateful ;-P

Moved the rating up to a 9 from an 8.  I doubt it will go higher due to various production issues and the occassional crazy swings due to the light combat system.  Is it as good as PR and Twilight Struggle?  I would say, almost, but not quite.

Now up to 10 plays.  I want to rate it a 10, but the components still nag at me some.  The cards are painfully hard to read - and I have up to date reading glasses.

The crappy rule book almost put me off this one at first but once you get past that theres an interesting, well balanced and fast playing wargame here. 
The first half hour tends to feel slow and samey whenever i play this which stops me rating it higher.
I like the production but i probably would have preferred it with a greener map and smaller minis (or just wooden cubes).

This actually feels a lot like Wilderness War to me and id recommend any fans of this to check it out (or visa versa). The number of viable stategies in this seems to be a little lower than WW though.

Complex, fiddly and slightly unbalanced but very good nevertheless! A great game that manages the rare feat of being both highly thematic and tactically rich with many options to explore in search of the win. Although very definitely not a card-driven wargame it has a similar feel thanks to the way your choices are limited by the action dice results, much like the way they're limited in a CDG according to your hand of cards. Multiplayer game is also interesting, although I do wish someone would come up with a non-team variant.

I love the theme, now if they could only adapt it into something like the much better A Game of Thrones or Struggle of Empires type systems...

Played 2 times.
Last Played Dec 16, 2006

Still unable to rate it.  The first game was difficult and I havn't been able to convince my husband to play it again.  The rules are much more complicated than anything we have tried before, so while the game seemed to be a good game, it is just more complex than we are usually looking for in a game.

I finaly rated it.  I enjoy the game, but it has a learning curve that is hard to get over unless you play it frequently and since my husband doesn't like it and it works best as a 2 player it doesn't get much action in my house.

I've been a die hard LoTR fan for decades. This matches the theme and flow of the books very well for a game. Its wonderful, a bit of randomness from the cards, but acceptable. The ONLY reason this is not rated higher is the playing time. At about 4 hours, it makes me not always willing to play it.

RATING: 4
One play.  My opponent and I agreed that the endgame was a letdown--our reaction was "well, that was anticlimactic."

I dislike the theme, and it's a theme-heavy game.

I would play this again if I had an opponent who really really wanted to play it.  I wouldn't suggest it myself.  That said, I think I would like it more with more plays, but I'm not sure the payoff would be worth the effort.

The components in the Fantasy Flight edition are *terrible*.  The plastic minis make it very difficult to tell the units apart.  Cardboard chits instead of minis would increase the usability considerably.

Very balanced game despite the seemingly overwhelming odds in favor of Sauron.  I really liked the mechanic of the cards and the choices...oh the choices...

By far the best LotR game experience in that it really lets the players feel the tension and buildup that provide the backdrop for the books in addition to doing a wonderful job modeling the journey of the ring itself.  The game feels desperate.  That is the only good word, and it is something truly special. Eventually I will finish painting all my minis and finally get it back to the table

An epic fantasy boardgame for two that captures the final moments of Frodo's trek to Mordor and Mount Doom.

Great game. More than 30 plays, always with a great pleasure. Components and minis are beautiful, especialy the board.

Une deuxième édition avec quelques modifications de règles et quelques changements graphiques:
- La matériel a été amélioré (les cartes plus grandes format tarot, plateau avec zones redimensionnées et plus ergonomique,en plus de la figurine de Gollum les figurines des nazguls ont été repensées et ne basculent plus comme c'était le cas avant), des display ont été créés pour les armées, 
- 2 aides de jeu sont désormais disponibles. 
- Les règles ont été réécrites et réorganisées et sont bien plus lisibles.
- Quelques cartes ont fait l'objet de modifications.

Le jeu est toujours aussi plaisant, toujours aussi bien équilibré, même après 35 parties la rejouabilité est une réalité.

RATING: 9
After one play, I feel that this game hits so many right buttons. There are lots of meaningful decisions and options each turn, the components are excellent, the theme is as well integrated into the game as I've ever seen, there's practically no down time, there's a true difference between strategies and playing styles of the two sides.
The map, while great looking, does have problems, making it difficult to see settlements and fortifications, especially when armies are covering them. And distinguishing different units is difficult at first - I painted their bases different colors to solve that problem. 
But these, relatively minor, problems aside, this is truely an excellent game.

There was this girl in college...let's call her Darcy, for no particular reason. The first time I saw this game was like the first time I saw Darcy: I immediately wanted to love it. The first time I played this felt like the first time I met Darcy: I immediately did love it. Unlike Darcy, however, this game loved me right back in unspeakable ways and failed spectacularly to turn me into a bereft and bitter creature resigned to the futility of existence and the perpetual agony of squatting on the pointy end of a soul-sucking vortex of despair.

This game is [i]almost[/i] as good as I hoped Darcy would be; one cannot simply abandon reason, after all. But for the longest time, I assumed my deep and abiding wannabe-love would go unrequited just as it had with her.

At BGG.CON 2012, a kindly soul reached down into the sucking void and lifted me out by teaching me this and playing it--twice! That's twice in four days, which for me is pretty darn good, whether it's gaming or loving.

It's exactly like love should be: beautiful, deep, true, entrancing, captivating and challenging. And when you see it, there's probably no chance that you will be so nervous about asking it for some together time that you flee in shame and cower in your room convinced that you will die alone and unloved and hated by small animals, that last one for no particular reason except that it elevates your self-pity and self-loathing to new heights for entertainment's sake.

Reject the sweet lies spread by the shallow and the jealous: that it is unapproachable and vain and tedious. No, it goes deep and stays deep, and if you can't appreciate that, then you don't deserve her...err, it. Love it, and it will love you back.

I am--at long last--sated.

I really want to love this game, it has BEAUTIFUL components and it is a Lord of the Rings game after all.

BUT BUT BUT:

To me it is way to repetitive and static. It feels more like an advanced Risk (which I loved in the 70s, but hate now). The game just seem to drag on forever...

I really do not understand the high BGG rating of this game

RATING: 6
Well, I don't get what is so fantastic about the game.  It does pretty decent job at recreating the books except there is a lot of character death.  However, there seems to be a lot of fiddling about, moving armies around when the game appears to boil down to if the Fellowship goes corrupt or reaches the crack of Doom.  Maybe the high raters have never played a game like this before, and it seems new and exciting?  And all that plastic really gets in the way.  The dice are nice, though!

Played last night and had a blast. Certainly captures the tone of the books.  I may even have to rate higher after a few plays as my one complaint is that the scales seem to heavily favor the shadow.  (after reading some comments I may just have had an unusually bad run of luck with the event cards). Oh and perhaps the clairity of the rules in a few spots, that slowed the game a bit, but once we had the rules down it flowed nicely.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I wasn't expecting much after reading the rules, but I was pleasantly surprised. The game neatly ties in many subsystems into a coherent whole that forces though, anguishing decisions on each turn. I wish there were more wargames like that out there. The simulation aspect of the game will also appeal LOTR fans; the rules allow you to relive the events of the book, or to explore what-if scenarios. Very nifty.

That being said, I have two concerns with the game. The first one is that it feels more random than it should (there are lots of results that only trigger on a roll of 6 on a D6, so a few die going one way or another can have an outsized result on the game). My other concern is that it seems that it seems almost impossible for the Shadows player to get 10 points in 12 turns??

Still, this is a very fun, tense game and I am looking forward to repeated playings.

Great execution of the Tolkien story in a game format. Long, compared to most Euro's, but short for many epic wargames. Luck of the draw and dice can effect outcome, but that's part of what keeps it exciting and keeps both sides in it to the end.

Bombastic game. Great in every aspect. The box is huge, board is large and really a lot of plastic pieces. The game itself is like making Tolkiens world alive, fantastic game feeling. The free people have no time to loose, Frodo must destroy the one ring. On the other side they need every dice to improve their military power to delay the plans of Sauron. Fascinating design, and after some games you can manage it to play in 3-5 hours (inclusive setup time).

I don't like to give 10s, so this is close. There is the possibility of the action dice coming up with some really bad rolls that will negate skill (e.g. Sauron getting all Event action dice). Otherwise, this is a balanced, assymetric war game that requires one to play the board and cards (can't really come up with specific 'openings' or techniques) - I like that.

RATING: 8.5
One of the most frustating games to learn, not only because of the mountain of rules but also because the games starts right in the middle of all the action. You have too many options right from the start without having any idea about what a good move is, this problem is even made worst because of the poor component design choices (board and minis) when it comes to giving you a good overview. Tip for introducing the game to a new player: let him/her play Sauron, because this side has more clear options and is a bit easier to play with.

The next play after the first full play it starts to be fun.

3rd play: free people win by me caused by destroying the ring, very satisfying, although Sauron was played by a first timer.

9nth play: Sauron failed to conquer the Gray Havens what would have resulted in a victory, instead the free people won the game in the first turn of the next round by destroying the ring. This was just epic.

My favorite two player game, and a game that I will honestly only play with one other person- my friend and co-designer, Brad. There is nothing in the gaming world I enjoy more than sitting across the table from Brad as we play this game. It takes a long time to set up and after MANY plays can feel a bit scripted, but it remains one of the most thematically cohesive and satisfying asymmetrical designs I can think of. A top five, desert island game for me.

This is the game that changed my gaming paradigm.  I have always had a bit of a problem with very chaotic/random games.  I rarely play/purchase overly random games, and many times I modify the rules to games I have purchased to reduce the randomness.  I don't have a lot of free time, so when I sit down to play a game I like to play against my opponent, not against his dice rolls.  That is, until I played WoTR.

This game is simply fun.  Don't misunderstand, there is a lot of thinking required and a multitude of decisions to be made, but they are largely limited to the 'action dice' rolls you have in a turn, and the cards you possess at the time.  Its hard to determine a long term strategy because you may not receive the dice rolls required to allow you to pursue it.  However, the short term tactics (essentially on a turn-by-turn basis) is very engaging.  The multitude of options due to the optimization needed to best utilize your action dice coupled with event cards; the large playing area and variety of pieces and objective areas; the multiple paths to victory; and the incredible theme - man this game is dripping with theme; come together to create a very fun game.  It is not the brain-burner that some of my wargames are, but for a lighter, decision-filled, super-replayable, well balanced, evening-playable, war-themed game, and especially for a LoTR fan, this game can't be beat.

Okay, here's the deal:  there are a lot of cards in this game, and to play well, you need to know them pretty well.  If you're playing against somebody who knows the game better than you, it can be pretty frustrating.  But for a couple of people that are playing the first, or third, or fifth time, it's cool.  I think it probably starts to wear out after 4 or 5 plays (I played it a few times before I started logging games here, so I've only got two "official" games in).  Definitely for two only - don't bother with 3 or 4 because it's really just a two-sided affair.

I have no idea how to explain it. A friend simplified it as risk. This might be appropriate at some level with the warring armies, but the fellowship and such really change this a lot. Afterall, in risk, one army can't run to the crack of doom and claim a victory!

Véletlenül vettem észre egy aukciós portálon, szemtelenül olcsón. Mindenképpen szerettem volna egy táblás wargame-et, érdekelt, hogy tetszene-e, hát gyorsan lecsaptam rá.
Több mint 200 darab szép kidolgozású - főleg a főszereplők! - műanyag figura, hatalmas játéktábla (a második kiadás táblája kicsit átláthatóbb, de ezt is meg lehet szokni hamar).
A játékszabály tanulmányozása - és az eredeti formátumba szerkesztése! :) -  legalább egy hétig tartott, nem nevezhető egyszerű játéknak a sok kis apróság miatt, de ebbe is hamar bele lehet jönni. De persze lehet, hogy csak kevés hasonló játékkal játszottam...
A játék azonban lenyűgözött! Valami hihetetlen profizmussal adja vissza a LoTR könyv élményét, nem véletlen az előkelő helye a Thematic rank-en is! Alapfelállásban a gonosz oldal annyival erősebb, hogy a wargame besorolás majdhogynem csak erre az oldalra érvényes. A szövetséges játékosnak nem sok esélye van így győzni, akárcsak az történetben kénytelen védeni magát és a harccal 'elterelni' a figyelmet Frodoékról, hogy a gyűrű megsemmisítésével megnyerhesse a játékot, ami szintén nem könnyű, érezni, hogy a nagy, vörösen izzó szem végig ott van rajtuk (gyűrűhajsza)! A karakterek megelevenednek, céljaik, sorsuk a könyv lapjairól egy az egyben került a játékba, de az eseménykártyák is ott és úgy használhatók fel, hogy a könyvhöz minél hűbb legyen a játék.
Számomra nagyon érdekes játékélményt nyújtott ez a játék - bár hossza és bonyolultsága miatt nem sűrűn kerül elő majd sajnos.
A játék után fiammal (gonosz oldal játékosa, természetesen) megnéztük a filmeket is. A játék alapján sok-sok részlet ismerős volt neki (bár ehhez a Knizia féle LoTR is hozzátett), de számomra is öröm volt felfedezni a sok hasonlóságot!

RATING: 7
UPDATE:  Dropped a point.  I still want to play, but just went through a game session that was FAR too long.  Maybe that was due to poor play on both our parts, but even so, that's too long.  Also, the cards crapped out halfway through.  Most of them were nigh unusable, and the dice didn't help matters much.  The SP still feels OP, and was corrupting the Fellowship no matter what I did.  Some harsh complaints are starting to sound really appropriate.  However, I do want to play again, but for dear God not that long.  

UPDATE #2: Sold. Waiting for the new edition.

Played twice, only finished once.  However, as far as I can tell, this game is holding up awfully well at mid-2006.  I'm still not catching what it's detractors don't like about it, which is unusual for me.  Look forward to more plays!

UPDATE #3: After a game with someone who really knows how to play, I need to acquire the new edition.

RATING: 8
My first impression is that it is a very balanced game. I managed to throw the ring in the fires of doom with 11 out of 12 corruption points for a win, when the Shadow Player had 9 victory points (10 needed to win) the first time I played. The second time the free peoples took a rather easy win, once again with the ring thrown down in the fires of doom (shadow player had 6 vp:s).

Every rule in this game reinforces the feel of Lord of the Rings. Very good, thematic rules that result in memorable games that feel like an epic struggle between good and evil.

On the con side, it takes a while to learn and to set up. Some of the provinces on the board are too small to hold the figures. Same-colored armies are difficult to tell apart at a glance.

RATING: 10
Acquired at a UK Games convention in October 2004.   

Great fun it is too - loads of variables to conjure with, especially for the free peoples player.  

The rules aren't anything like as daunting as they first look!

What's impressive is how well it simulates the dynamics going on in Tolkien's masterworks. As the free people's player you stand a negligible chance of winning a military victory but you can pose just enough of a military threat to "distract" the eye player's attention from the fellowship providing you think laterally, keep the fellowship moving and are prepared to take a few risks.

Sure, it's imbalanced in favour of the shadow player but I don't have a problem with that - makes it feel true to the books.

I'm gonna have to paint those figures some time...

After 18 plays I upgraded my rating to a 10.  It gets better every time I play it and I find it difficult to imagine not enjoying this wonderful, wondrful game.

This my rating from just one playing. I thoroughly enjoyed the game. It was much more that what I expected. They managed to combine the war with the mission to destroy the ring in a very clever and smooth gaming mechanism. 

I am not sure about the replayability of the game. I hope that the cards in addition to the dice-controlled actions will keep the game fresh and no real "opening ala chess" will be developed. Actually, this was my only concern and my rating might go even higher if I feel that its replayability is high.

I really like this game, to the point where I should probably rate it a 9 or 10. However there isn't a whole lot of strategic options on either side unless you get lucky on the card draw.  Still is a lot of fun to play and even with only a few strategic options the tactical game always plays out differently.

I'm pretty disappointed by War of the Ring. First of all, let me state it is fun to play, even if it is long (for Euro standard). It has theme, it has character and it definitely has a "I see the story developing in front of me" factor that is quite unique. But, as a wargame, it's hardly great... let me explain why:
1) There's no maneuver. Having troops that slowly wander (1 space at a time) in such a large map simply makes maneuver impossible. No flanking, no desperate double marches to the rescue, nothing. Just one space moves, one space attack. The evil player mass up big armies, then overruns the free people, and this stops when a siege starts. Makes WWI looks dynamic. There are some moves that can actually be done as distraction, but I'd say 90% of the moves are just spent in massing up, moving up to the next objective and smashing. Finesse? Not available.
2) This leaves a system that seems to be based much on the administration of your resources instead of using them in clever way. This is in part true... but then, the dice comes. You roll the dice to decide your action, and this, epecially as a free people player conditions your action from a little to very much, depending on the dice rolled and the time of the game. I had a fast start with some lucky military victories which gained me time to move the fellowship more... but when I finished gaining time, I've got no character dice for three turns in a row. So the fellowship stayed still while the opponent got back in track from the early victory I had. Unability to seize themoment because I'm not that good at rolling the action dice? And you call this strategy? So the game hints that you should be good at using your resource, and then does half job on your behalf with those dice. The game then plays much more like an action/reaction system, where you on't do long term planning (only a very broad plan), and then follow your and your opponent dice wherever they take you.
3) If dice for actions are not enough in providing randomness for the game, the game throws at you buckets of dice for combat, then to hunt the fellowship, and to this the corruption tiles add another layer of luck. I know my game ended after four hours of player because I've drawed the wrong hunt tile while I was on the final stretch of the fellowship run, and then my opponent managed to roll a killing 5 on the dreaded die result. Disappointing, to say the least, as one roll of the die decided a 4 hours game. 
4) Finally the game has some complicated rules (fellowship rules spring to mind), by Euro standard, but then it has boring rules for armies (no characterization, all armies are identical, no matter if they had a lot of sculpts avilable), characters (this is almost ridiculous, the good characters are almost interchangeable with leaders 99% of the time, the evil chars are a little bit better however as far as characterization goes), cards (lots of cards with the same effects, a lots of cards that apply only on special situations, making them  interesting only if you have this or that character in a particular location when you draw it...), terrain...
In the end, I could end up playing this another time. Or two. But just for the fun factor involved... as far as wargames go, this is probably one of the most brainless dicefest I've tried.

Gorgeous, epic game if you don't mind the randomness of the dice and cards ... which I don't. The theme is reflected VERY well in this game. The game isn't particularly easy to teach or learn, because the rulebook isn't one of the best I've read.

It will take a couple of games to really get the hang of it. This game however, is worth all the effort.

The map can get cramped, and the Nazgul are clumsy, but otherwise fantastic production.

Played this a lot. Excellent, tense two-player game that really captures the story - there's no pasted-on theme here!

I feel it is slightly unbalanced in favor of the free peoples if they concentrate on destroying the ring and aren't afraid to sacrifice companions in order to avoid corruption. The shadow won't have time for a military victory, and trying to stop the fellowship relies a lot on chance. Still, what a great game.

Very few board games are as immersive as War of the Ring, and no other game encompasses the grandeur and the scale of the books like War of the Ring.  I like pretty much everything about this game: the dice for actions, the cards, the characters, even the slightly unbalanced gameplay. I feel like I'm playing through the books, that I'm engaging in an epic struggle, and I love it.

The game is not simple, and it is long.  Also, do not try to play this with more than two; the three and four player variants are really a joke.  If you don't like asymmetry and some luck, you won't like this, but any fan of the books should try it out. It is a fantastic game.

Best two player game, and one of the best games I´ve ever played. Period

2009-10-10: This game is just awesome. Welcome to my top 10 Mr War of the Ring

2010-01-12: There are some minor issues with the game. First, there's this issue with the Companions. They 4 companions + 1 army unit... and the unit gets killed, and so the whole pare of companions. It doesn't make any sense. Companions should add dice to combat pool, and also should be taken out as casualties... one by one.  Second, War of the Ring, has a point of no return for the Free Peoples player. As armies get removed from the game, there's this point where if enough of your armies get killed, there's no way you can get back in the game... it's a better call to just give up. I don't like that in a game. I'm going to change my rating until my next WotR game.

RATING: 9
Excellent thematic game.
Gameplay is streamlined but the game offers different strategies for each side. Competing war actions and ring quest actions are cleverly rendered. There is a lot of playing cards with quite immersive texts which make the first play a real pleasure.
Also, game component are to notch, even if managing large armies in small territories can become difficult.
The game may become a bit repetitive after numerous plays, but it's always a pleasure to take it out of the shelf.

I've played this game 3 times, but I doubt I'll ever play it again.
The game is unbalanced in favor of the Shadow player(s). THe ring is almost impossible to get to mount Doom, and the forces of evil grow too quickly. The sensation of playing the good guys, constantly on the verge of destruction differs greatly from the comfort of playing the evil guys.

Also the components should have been painted properly.

Truly epic game. I've only played a small number of times but they were all great experiences. The production is pretty annoying however, small print on the cards, and a lot of non-useful plastic figures crowded onto tiny (yet accurate!) map areas. Next time I play I hope it's with someone with a set modded for useability. 

A bonus for this game is that it helped me totally understand what was going on in the movie version of Return of the King, cause I haven't read the books. Yeah, you heard me, I haven't read 'em. The first hundred pages of Fellowship are boring and I'm not a patient man.

RATING: 7.5
Wargame themed after Lord of the Rings. Players roll action dice that dictate their actions: move, recruit units,  play event cards, etc. Event cards can be used to influence battles. Excellent theme, very nice pieces. Game length  has varied from 3 hrs to 6 hrs, but fully engaging. Excellent two player game; 3 player version is fun if you are the fellowship since the two shadow players will start stepping on each other's toes, but not as fun if you are one of the shadow players. Many dice rolls, so luck is a factor, but this game does transport you to Tolkein's world. For the two player game, I would rate this an '8'; for the three player game, especially if you are one of the evil players, I would rate it a '7'.

RATING: 10
Near Perfect game. Amazing theme that feels natural with the mechanics. Elegant and clean game-play with lots of strategy, tension, fun, and even room for roleplay give the great interlock between theme and mechanics. Does a wonderful job of simulating everything that is Lord of the Rings. This game should have been called "Lord of the Rings" and Lord of the Rings the board game should have been called "Journey to Mount Doom" or something because this has all things war of the ring wonderfully simulated in a single game whereas LOTR the game focuses just on the journey of the hobbits. If you buy just one LOTR game or just one board game, make it this one. It's great even if you don't like LOTR. Everything from design to art to components to feel to originality in mechanics to the sense of urgency all the way to the climax--all of it is beautifully crafted.

We now have the second edition upgrade kit in addition to the Lords of Middle Earth expansion which largely overlaps with the expansion of the first game with a few ommissions and improvements. We've had the very difficult task of including the second edition upgrades with the expansion as well as elements from the first edition expansion that are not redundant with the new expansion (such as the ents or siege weapons). It was clunky at first but now I feel it makes the game that much richer though some of those first edition expansion components/mechanics such as ents, corsairs, and siege weapons are not used as much since they're less useful (probably why they were left out Lords of Middle Earth) still, thematically, it's nice that they're now available to us in case the situation calls for them.

I currently have second edition upgrade kit, lords of middle earth and soon warriors of middle earth.

Great game. After many plays, it still feels fresh and exciting every game. The much-derided dice rolling actually enhances the tension of the game, rather than detracting from the strategy.

Downsides: You need a long time to expalain (starting with a litle bit "boring" example game only for the mechanics). You have a long list with rulemistakes. And the first game needs 4-5 hours. You have to paint the figures, or you have a big problem to defined the armees.

RATING: 4
An intense and admirably detailed game that I'll probably never play again.  My third complete play convinced me that WotR, despite its numerous virtues, is just not worth the time investment it requires.  Why not?  Several reasons.  One, there are way too many rules.  Minor, easily forgettable, buried-in-the-manual rules.  Two, there are way too many exceptions to those rules.  I think the manual uses the word "except" more than any other in board game history.  Three, most of the cards have very nit-picky conditions for legal play, and you will find yourself unable to use anything in your hand with appalling frequency.  Four, the action dice, while not devoid of flexibility, are a poor method of reducing AP-related downtime.  No swords for the Free Peoples player(s) means no movement for Frodo.  No movement for Frodo means a 90% likelihood that the Shadow forces will win the game.  On the plus side, they might do it fast enough so that the good guys don't suffer much.  But if they don't, the game can be a long and grinding nightmare that you endure, rather than play.  A reluctant thumbs down for War of the Ring.

RATING: 7
An otherwise good and very thematic game, but it takes far too long for what is offered for my preferences. The miniatures and the map borders can get annoyingly confusing on the board and lacks elegance that other games like GoT has for example in this regard.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Best WOTR game, due to the clever "Schrodinger's cat" style Fellowship - the fellowship is somewhere a certain distance from where you last spotted them, but neither side knows where until they are revealed. Or maybe it's the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Nice map and miniatures, but card text is a bit too small for most people.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Game played faster than I thought.  About 2&1/2 hours for both games that we played back to back.  Amazing how closely it follows the books.  Yes, of course there are some alternative possibilities, otherwise it WOULD be the books.  Gives a very strong JRR Tolkein vibe to it.  Excellent 2 player game.  Just make sure you have the time, and are not too worried about game balance.  Remember this is about the books and their history, meaning that the bad guys are weighted in their favor.  Still fun though.

The expansions pull something away from the game.  I think I prefer the base game.  However, the Ents are pretty cool and do fill a gap.  The Galadriel piece is far to strong, and the Umbar Ships are almost worthless.  The Siege engines add almost nothing to the game.

WoW! I'm a fan of the books/movies but not overly so, but boy was I impressed with this game. I will admit that as we were going over the rules and trying to come to terms with the odd design choices, I was a bit dubious. Once things got rolling, though, this proved to be a great game that does its subject matter a great service. I look forward to many more playings.

RATING: 5
Very good ideas and design, it catches the spirit of Tolkien books, BUT... it is not a user-friendly game to play: too long (especially the set-up), too much event cards driven (looking at the cards in your hands and deciding their use takes time and slows down playing: I prefer games in which variation is obtained through elegance of design instead of event cards), somehow "heavy" to play without such significant strategical choices that repays for the effort. When I discovered euro-games some years ago the first thing I appreciated was that their little playing time, elegant simple rules allow more strategic choices than wargames I used to play. And I stopped playing wargames simply because I found euro games funnier to play and at the same time more rewarding. I think that WofR is an hybrid between wargames and euro-games (a very good thing in itself), but too much pending towards the wargame kind for my tastes

It's long, the board is too big yet many of the regions are too small, the pieces need to be distinguished better, and it is altogether pretty fun!

Upgraded to a 10, but that's mainly for the Collector's Edition, which makes the game much more playable from a logistics standpoint and includes the expansion.

I love this game and play it at any opportunity. Despite the terrible rules and the amount of time and energy necessary to play the game, it seems fresh and tense every time I play. That said, there are some friends who refuse to play this game ever again. That said, I think this is one of the best games emulating a genre or book, and almost see it as playing a "What If" scenario or alternate retelling of the Lord of the Rings rather than just playing a game. Wonderful!

RATING: 8.5
A beautiful design!. It is outstanding how the game system handles & involves the fellowships journey, the characters from the book and the political situation of Middle Earth. Thumbs up too for the use of action dice. Why I do not rate this game higher are for 2 reasons: a)The nature of Middle Earth makes it difficult for the Free People nations to aid each other more than localy (Gondor/Rohan, The Shire/Grey Havens & Mirkwood/Iron Hills). b)The conditions for several event cards to be useful while in your hand, can be hard to achieve, even as they double as battle cards. Rating based on four solitare and five head-to-head sessions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not the "epic" game I was expecting.  Too short, key battles resolved too quickly and limited strategies make for limited replay value (for me, anyhow).  Technically, you can play this with more than 2, but like Axis & Allies, this is not a multi-player game.

The best game in the small field of fantasy wargames. Unfortunately most of my wargaming friends scoff at fantasy and my fantasy gaming friends aren't interested in a 4 hour game with 24 pages of rules. I've enjoyed the 2 games I've played, but I'm worried about the lack of strategic options - the FP has only 1 or 2 feasible routes to Mordor, and usually only wants to reinforce his armies, not move them. The Sauron player has more military options, but I'm worried that the cards will dictate which one to do.

This game has the best game material i've ever seen, it's simply gorgeous. I am also very found of everything related to Middle-Earth.

RATING: 7
With no knowledge of the cards or the odds, my fellowship simply rolled merrily along in my first game with just the expectation of enjoying the game. It's the one game of recent times that I've been thinking about afterwards, thinking through different ways to play the game. I'm not sure I'd ever want to play the dark side though - too wargamery - whereas for a traditional euro player like myself, the fellowship was fun, balancing risks and multiple options. Great chrome.

THE Lord of the Rings war game.  The theme is heavy as is the game (physically and mentally).  A bit unbalanced to the evil side.  This is fixed with the add on 'Battles of the Third Age'.  Even with the advantage to the evil side, it's a classic game.

Very thematic, albeit fairly long.  Chris Farrell's comment that the open action dice are a problem is spot on.  I think that it might be fun to play a game in which the dice rolls are in secret for each side (on the honor system, of course, though in a computer implementation this could be easily properly enforced).

Gorgeous game. To my mind this is universally one of the best adaptations of Tolkien's master-piece. Players that are fans of the Book will be given one of the most involving experiences they can ever hope to get. No spectator of the LotR film will ever be able to so accurately feel the intense clash of the free peoples/fellowship of the Ring against the Shadow Warriors. Simply fantastic!

An immense fantasy themed war strategy game. Set up time is above average. Playing time can be up to 2h30mins (do yourself a favour and don't ever try to play this with 4 players! this is a 2-player game!).

- Extensive rules that are not very well structured and might originate some confusion. Due to the different gaming styles fused into one game, reading these rules requires close attention and are best studied with the game set up on your table so you can better understand how it all works. Once you get it though, the game is fairly easy to play. Nevertheless, this is no game for newcomers!

I'm sorry everybody but this game didn't "do it" for me in a BIG way. Having played it I am now of a mind that I would prefer another spinal tap to playing this again.

I ranked this game on the scale given I did find this game extremely annoying and I will not play again I traded this albatross away at a slight loss just to get it the hell out of my house.

There is a lot going on here, so one play is not enough to make a real comment. Given that, the game is chalk full for those who are really into the LotR. The mission is as it is in the books/movie, the fellowship must destroy the ring or get others to join them while the evil side must kill off the friendly armies or slow down the ring bearer and corrupt him. Lots of possible actions, but as the fellowship you must move fast as time is not on your side.

When I opened the game box I was in awe of the quality of the game components.  As a wargamer perhaps purchasing games from Decision Games at even greater cost, may have lowered my standards.  With information gathered from previous post on BGG I knew I was going to paint the minis before actually playing the game, the details of the sculptures demanded it. 9 days later and after 35 hrs of painting I played my first solitaire game.  The game is great fun was easy to learn and shows great replayablity.  I am completely pleased with my purchase.

Often 2-player games are very short, light, or quick playing.  None of these are bad things (in fact, most are considered quite desireable!) but sometimes that's just not what I'm looking for.  I'm looking for a meat and potatoes type of game, a game with lots of stuff going on where the fate of the universe/world/country is based on my decisions.  This role would normally be filled by a game such as Twilight Imperium (or perhaps even Axis and Allies), but until I played War of the Ring I had yet to be able to scratch that itch with just one other player. After one play my impression is that this game completely fills my need for a deep 2-player strategy game, and it is a lot of fun as well. 

I also feel this game does an amazing job of recreating the struggle for Middle Earth as read in the books (or seen in the movies).  While playing the game I feel like I am facing many of the same dilemnas that the fellowship (or sauron!) faced in the books, and yet always with a different twist to make the choice difficult.  Although I am a fan of the books and movies (movies moreso than the books, I'm not afraid to admit), I am certainly not a fanboy.  I just very much enjoyed the many 'what if?' scenarios that even one play of the game brought to the table.

I particularly like the 'action die' system.  Instead of each person having a long drawn out turn (ala Axis and Allies) each player is continually making decisions and actively participating.  Sure, not getting the actions that you need can be frustrating to a control freak, but I believe it just makes you have to adapt to the situation at hand.

Anyway, if you like games like TI and A&A and only ever seem to have one friend around willing to spend 4 hours of their life playing a board game with you, War of the Ring should fit the bill!

An excellent game, great depth and strategic options from a fairly straightforward ruleset.  Great LOTR flavor too.  Might be a 10 if not for the ugly map.

Best among many LotR games, I think.
Surprisingly playable and vividly trace the triligy with nice "ifs".
Recommended for all LotR fans whether BG geek or not.

...but rulebook layout is a little suck.

Awesome area-control game which allow you to replay Lord of the Rings in the most satisfying way. It's a bit more complex to play as the Free People. It is really a 2-player game, but is playable with 3 or 4 players as well.

Feels as if two games are put into one. The search of the ring and the war for it. The fellowship prevents this from being some kind of Risk-sequel-clone. Also the leaders give nice flavour to the game. Although the battling and searching the fellowship systems have dice, they are unique and bear different symbols than regular dice = more fun than it would be with regular dice. Surely would like to play a second game!
Quite a lot of figures, I'd say.

As expected, a giant gleaming heap of awesomeness made from pure win.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure how often I'll get to play it (just like Die Macher!)  It's quite long and highly specialized.  I DID get Wifey to play, because she loves me and is a huge LotR fan.  Really re-creates the book well, and while the Free Peoples do start feeling like they're behind, the fact that dice have a lot of say in what everyone gets to do ends up helping.

RATING: 9
Payed only once with 3 players. So many things to remember so it was actually easier to play with a third player. One player can browse the rules continually and remind the others of what is forgotten and what can be done.
The bad guy won in the end, but we actually did not have a clue what we were doing in the beginning so it really does not count. 
Easiest way to learn this game is to start playing and see what happens. After a while the dice were not a problem any more. Fighting and playing event cards were automatic etc. Then after 1st play it is time to read ALL the rules again and notice all the forgotten/missed details.

I dearly would like to try it again soon.

Nine Year Old Son Catching the Nuances Upon His First Game: Priceless +0.50 Subjective 

I find very little not to like about this game.
Theme is utterly perfect-- everything seems to concur perfectly with the world of Tolkien.  The cards give flavor and speak to various actual events.  The characters affect the world in a meaningful and intelligent way.  This is Tolkien's war, as it should be.  

People complain about the graphics and card font.  Buy glasses.

People complain that the dice/cards often push them away from developing overarching strategies or that the system is too random.
This game is about balancing what you CAN ACTUALLY DO with what you NEED TO ACCOMPLISH.  One must maximize the use of the resources that one has available, each turn.

The mechanic supports the theme elegantly, by creating an atmosphere of attrition and defensive tactics (Free Peoples) versus territorial gain and unchecked military buildup (Shadow Armies)

My only complaints would be the game length and that it is decidedly a two player game only (from my view) unless you find playing with partnerships appealing.  This game is in every other way flawless.

I just love this game. At least in theory, because I've had only one go at it. The only problem with this game is it's lenght.

4/5 hour game needs lot of spouse-karma points, and being a (ideally) 2 player game, I'm not the only one needing those points...

Apart from that, this is an epic game with epic proportions. The game components are just great and the game play quite lean!!!

Who can play?  Uber-geeks.  2 players.

Absolutely the best Lord of the Rings game for a couple of geeks that want to sink that ring in Mount Doom or wreak havoc with orcs and nazgul.  The game is assymetrical, so the Fellowship player is on an adventure to Mordor while the Shadow player is waging a risk-style wargame to destroy Middle Earth.  More than any other geek-fest this is the one I can't get enough of.

just learning it now.  large and unweildy system compensated for by the promise of immersing oneself in an epic theme. i adored SPIs war of the ring, and this looks like a more manageable version of that one.  once the mechanics (loaded as they are with tweaks and exceptions) become more familiar, i will be more on board.
later:  once the mechanics become familiar, moves surprisingly quickly, with short actions trading back and forth each turn.  the cards beautifully drive the narrative without determining the outcome.

This game has some amazing components. It's a longer game, and is moderately complicated, but it provides such a rewarding and immersive experience. By far the best Lord of the Rings board game out there. High replay value, too. Gameplay is asymmetric, but the game is well balanced. One of my all time favorites.

Amazing light war game. Gotta love the great miniatures and the whole feel of the Middle Earth environment. Takes a bit to get used to, plus the rules can be a bit complex, and furthermore, each card you play can bend/change that on every turn.

RATING: 8.5
Really captures the feeling of the books. Very good game overall. A tough game to really get a handle on, especially as I don't get enough chances to play it, since it's basically a 1 on 1 game. I feel like the 4 player version feels more like a 1 on 1 game with a "teams" mode tacked on. Hope I get to play it a lot more.

Purchased because it was such a good price - rules are crazy.  It'll take some learning, this one, before I can give it any honest grade.  For now, it loses a point because the rulebook and explanations are so unintuitive.

Edit:  Tried to play twice now, neither have been complete.  I can say that we always start with a lot of interest, but after trying to play and constantly having to consult rules and slowing play, I'm getting frustrated.  It also would have been very nice if the different race armies had some kind of distinguishing feature from one another -- but because there isn't any such thing, I'll be forced to paint the bases at least.. but then I ask, "why?" .. I have yet to have some fun with this one, but I'm not going to rate it yet.

Update: Traded.

Really like the way this game incorporates so many of the story elements and still remains interesting and challenging as a game.  Love the hunt and hide the ring aspects.

It really doesnt get much better than this game.  They pretty much thought of everything.  It's a fantastic adaptation of LOTR.  It's fun to be both sides, as they have so many different things to do.  Especially with the expansion you have a perfect game.  Without it you have less options, but still is a great game.  Every single game of this I have played has been completely epic.  I mean, it is ALWAYS down to the wire.  There is never a landslide game.  Over the 4 hours it takes to play, with all the different actions and stategies, the game is soooo well balance that it always comes down to someone at the mouth of mount doom on the same turn that Sauron is about to crush his final victory point.  It is so intense when you pull that last tile to see if you toss the ring in or not.  I personally like to be Good guys since you get all the fun fellowship characters, but being evil is great to.  I like to attack the DEW line (the settlements to the northeast) rather than the typical Gondor Rohan attack.  I could play it every week (and I did for a long time!)

One play of this highly rated (Euro?) wargame, which really tests your dedication to the hobby. I have high respect that this game offers a strong visual and detailed narrative via some interesting and novel mechanics(simulating the book better than Knizia's designs), but sadly for me it also provides text overload, fiddly rules and play, and the real test of entertainment tolerance: the length of playing time; my interest waned after 2 hours of labourious reading & rule checks. This game was a reality check for me that I will never have the dedication nor the additude of a true gamer, I'm quite content with simpler fare; despite the strange narrative of Knizia's Middle Earth designs, especially The Confrontation, I admire their streamline functionality and short term pleasure they provide, but more importantly these are designs I have more chance of playing with loved ones. My rating reflects my gradually growing casual player attitude.

The components are excellent; some of the best I have ever seen in a game. This is a low level wargame; no more difficult to learn than A&A. It plays best with only two players. The games we have played have been evenly balanced even though the sides have different goals; the game is well developed. The multi-purpose cards not only add flavor but prevent the game from falling into a 'perfect strategy' trap. The first game was long (5+ hours), subsequent games have taken half of that. Note: the 'dark side' has much more to do during the game than the Fellowship.

I love how well it recreates the situation during the Third Age, both with armies and placements, as well as the political track and how you have to convince those to go to war.  Movement and Combat are both handled very well, and I particularly like the combat system of 5&6 is a hit, and both sides deliver casualties at the same time.  Even the leader re-rolling allows for less luck-based outcomes.

This game really is quite immersive, and I find that I don't even notice the hours ticking by when I play this.

An outstanding game. The execution of theme within this game is beyond words. You really feel like you are in the Lord of the Rings novels. I actually feel like I'm in the stories while playing this game. You can have real tension as the ring bearer trying to get to Mordor. The military situation is balanced very well, so that the free people can just have a hope of holding on long enough to win. So many decisions and different paths to follow to victory (or defeat). One of my favorite games of all time.

4/1/2008 - Well after long consideration, I have decided to give this game my only 10 rating (at this time). I consider this game an absolute masterpiece.

Played this beast for the first time and it did not disappoint, sure, getting your head around the rules is a legendary feat but worth your while and the the rules are at least coherent and not badly written (like so many other games). It seems there are much more possible strategies than meet the eye and I quite like the idea of tactics being shaped through the random card draws (although I think there should have been a few more). A deep and engaging game. I love the theme (Tolkien !) and I think nothing needs to be said about the artwork and miniature etc. While not the most efficient (the map can be confusing and the figures look alike in parts), they are gorgeous. Brilliant Game. One of my favourites

I did not have time to complete a full game, however the game would seem to have a lot to offer.  I can see some value to building up your forces as the evil empire rather than attacking very early as I did.  Attacking early allowed the Ring bearers side to begin mustering new recruits on a regular basis.  I really like the idea behind the track of war as I call it.

This is THE Tolkein game. It defines the genre.  Of all the games it brings the true flavor of the War and the struggle to destroy the ring. Unlike other games (MECCG, LoTR Board game) this has it all in one easily accessible package. The only complaint I've seen that's truly justified is the small text on the cards, but you get used to it some how.  The map is beautiful, the pieces are awesome (you don't HAVE to paint them), the rulebook is attractive and well written (perhaps with some minor organizational problems), and the game play simply works.  I have no problems with the length of the game (4 hrs for the first game, much less after that), considering other games, like LoTR Risk, take just as long.  I would strongly suggest forgoing the "introductory game", it is little but an unfair game of risk, weighted strongly in favor of the sauron player.  Dive right into the richness of the standard game, break a few rules as you learn, but you will enjoy yourself so much more.  You can't beat this game for full imersion into Tolkein's world.  Update: After 10 plays, the game consistently takes only 2hrs, and I still love it and want to play more.

I can't help but be amazed by this game.

Some have compared it to Risk-LOTR but I think the only thing it has to do with Risk is battle resolutions and then only because of dices you have to throw. There's much more to it than just dices : battle action cards that can change much, elite regiments and officers. There's also a different kind of battle (one that can go on for several 'dice-use') when there's a siege and that reminds me of Hannibal's system.

I don't think it's correct to assume Free-people's player has far less to do because he has less action dices : the Dark Lord must spend several dices tracking down the Fellowship if he wants to avoid the destruction of the One Ring. So, all in all, they almost have an equal number of actions to play on each turn. However there are a few Mordor action cards  that are truely too powerful.

Just a question : why are some people rating it at 1 when the, obviously, haven't played the game ?

A great one in all senses. I love the way designers have caught the mood of the story. As the Shadow player, get the most from your unlimited army resources and political advantage. Your only chance to win is conquering at least ten point of free people settlements. Beware of your strongholds is your Achilles heel. As the Free People player, move your companions group as far as you can or try to get two shadow stronghold. Fantastic strategy game with a lot of variants and possibilities, perfect for group gaming. Mix of cards, figures, strategy and one of the best written story ever. Superb components quality.

I must have played this 15 times and no game is ever the same, each telling a different (and often cool/funny) story.  The luck element is gauged just perfectly, while still rewarding tactically-sound behavior. The board is beautiful. Highly recommended with the added rules/items from "Battles" expansion.

RATING: 8.5
Surprisingly well-balanced given the two different ways of winning/losing. Some of the cards can be a bit powerful, but I think the game would have felt stale without them. Feels respectful towards Tolkien's work while letting the players make their own choices and have the war play out in a different way. Many interesting tactical choices add replayability. The main downside is that the 3- and 4-player options feel like an afterthought. That said, I think this game is fun any which way you play it.

Takes a lo-o-o-ong time to learn, and our first few games ran at least six hours each. Nowadays we can usually finish in the advertised 3 hours or less. But even at six hours, the game is riveting for the entire time!

While this [i]is[/i] a wargame, it is not [i]just[/i] a wargame. It is amazingly rich in theme, evoking the novels on every play without ever forcing the action to follow the literary plot. You must not only maneuver your armies, but also make the right choices for around ten different individual characters. As the Free Peoples player you must keep Sauron's armies at bay and try to sneak the Ring into Mordor without allowing the Ringbearer to be completely corrupted by the Ring. As the Shadow Forces, you must divide your attention and your resources between your attempts to crush the Armies of the West and your urgent search for the Ring!

Solid game - not brilliant but not a disaster.  Captures the feel of the novel well, but also feels too scripted.  Pacing is a bit off: as much time is spent merely marching reinforcements up to the front; a more clever design could have abstracted this and cut down the playing time. The set-up is a bit too fiddly, especially with very similar looking miniatures.  Finally the cards don't quite work: they don't add much tension and in some ways are not random enough!  Some events are good and will always appear (e.g. knockout Saruman) where others will never appear.  More constraint would ensure the game played differently every time.  As it stands, there is little tension: if you have a good card you just hold it 'til you play get a chance to play it.  But, it works, integrates characters and armies, and covers the full scope of Middle Earth.  It also usually comes down to a tense climax, as each player is running a different race, and speed in your race tends to also mean speed for the other player in his race: this does however exacerbate the role of chance.

Based on one play, may change later.  There are lots of German games and lots of wargames I would rather play.  I have a very hard time understanding all the ten ratings.  This is a long, slow game with too much randomness for that sort of commitment of time.  Disliked how my turn's strategy was chosen randomly and then I had to adapt my tactics to match this random die roll.   Furthermore, the graphic design is terrible!  It LOOKS good, but borders are hard to distinguish, imporant locations are tiny and buried under counters, many important regions are too small to hold the armies that should be put into them (and stacking counters under minitures like A&A does not work well because the counters are _slick_ & don't stack well), card sizes and fonts are way too small, etc., etc.  The Fellowship Player has far fewer choices than the Dark Power player, which is not fun if you are the Fellowship. 
(Overall, I suspect if I play it more my rating will drop...)
This game was obviously based on SPI's War of the Ring game.  What the designer did was take that counter fest and try to make it easier for newcomers. Shame he could not have used the font that SPI used on its event cards.
Trying to figure out the good points / attractive qualities of this game:  The theme is what makes this game fun, if not for that I would expect at least a 2 point drop in its ratings.  I suspect that the theme has enouraged a large group of people ready for bigger / longer games to try one and that is a good thing.  
UPDATE: Thought of another thing that some people may like.  Many games with lots of choices suffer from 'analysis paralysis' (not a problem in my group thankfully).  With this game your stragetgic choices are made RANDOMLY and you have to adapt.  No paralysis for newbies who would freeze up with a big game.  That suggests to me that it may be a transition game from light games to heavier strategic games.  Still have hard time understanding all the ten ratings tho.

Great Game; beautiful figures; wonderfully captures the flavor of the movies and books.  Intro game horribly broken, meaning you go straight to the regular game, but that has a long learning-curve.

In FILES, I have two Revised Intro downloads for those who want faster play that also fixes the Intro game.

Very fun game.  Great two player wargame that takes a few hours to knock out.  Both sides play VERY differently and don't always give an obvious approach.  Our game was a great bout that came down to the last second when the Fellowship was at the crack of Doom and the final hunt tile was drawn.  It turned out to be high enough to corrupt the ringbearers to the point of a loss for quite an upset.  Looking forward to the expansion.

This is certainly one of best thematic games. The miniatures, the map and the artwork on the cards are gorgeous. After one (and a half) plays it seems as there are a lot of strategies to try out. The Mordor player is certainly creating the game (is he giving the fellowship opportunities to advance; does he attack Gondor, Rohan or the Elves?), while the fellowship player rather reacts to this. 

In general I am not a big fan of reading a bunch of cards in each turn. But here I can overlook this easily, since the cards really offer a lot of different possibilities and increase the thematic flair of the game. The only down side I see so far for this game is the very long setup time and the rules. The rule book is well written, but there are just a lot of rules to remember (especially regarding politics) and you will have to take a look in the rule book several times during first play.

tl;dr: Not a bad game, but probably not a game for me.

I've read the rulebook & the Universal head instructions multiple times.  I've set this game up and run through 3 - 4 turns a number of times mostly by myself, but once with my wife.  I just can't muster the gumption to care.

I love the idea of a board game encompassing all aspects of the War of the Ring.  But this game just kills the intrigue for me.  I think it has to do with all the special-case rules.  Rules for moving the fellowship, splitting off from the fellowship, fighting in the field, fighting in a siege, each card in the game is its own set of rules.  The expansion makes the problem worse.

Like I said, I love the idea of all these, but when it comes to actual play, I get bogged down and don't want to actually do anything because I don't want to have to look it up.

Even when I do finally grasp it all, the strategy for what to do next isn't obvious.  Even if I pursue trying to achieve the conditions for a particular event card - pulling it off seems to be only a marginal improvement in my situation.  That's probably by design.

By that point, I've invested HOURS of effort in reading, setting up, and actually playing, and I still don't care.  I don't have that kind of time these days to invest in something I get little satisfaction from.

My reaction is a little weird since I really like TI3 and both these games strike me as having a similar "weightiness", so maybe it's just the theme?

I'd be willing to play it with an enthusiastic partner, but I doubt I'll ever suggest it.

Excellent 2-player wargame that really captures the flavour of one of my favourite books (and now also movies). Both players are constantly on the lookout for opportunities for themselves, and potential pitfalls for their opponent (often determined by the strategy cards), and all the while trying to play according to a grand strategy. More balanced than the uneven distribution of units would seem to imply.

And, yes, it does play much better and easier now that I painted the bases in the nations' colours. I also added the different city size bits from Sid Meier's Civilization to serve as towns and cities, and the fortifications from History of the World (Hasbro) for the strongholds (they nicely contain a city from Civ). This makes the board a lot clearer. In case the board should become too crowded in places, I use the plastic chips from Axis & Allies as replacements. Works better than those cardboard chits in the game.

RATING: 6
Revised rating:  Extremely onerous to set up and play - moreso even than any of the big hex-and-counter games I've played. Payoff just isn't worth the work, especially once you get that deja-vu feeling from the scripted play. 

-----------------------------------

Various mechanics hang together well. Dunking the ring sub-game is genius, as is interactive action die system.  Great interplay between characters, events and battles. 

Hurt by the limited options available to Fellowship player. Play becomes predictible with experienced players as much of map is best ignored. 

Still, will produce tremendous narrative game experiences before strategic limitations become apparent.

RATING: 8
I enjoy this game very much.  I think it does an excellent job of creating a narrative (which is the joy of the game for me...watching it unfold, more than winning at all costs), but you have to be prepared for a fairly luck-driven experience (although being familiar with the cards can ameliorate the luck factor some).  I have played about 10 times, and it almost always comes down to the wire.

 First impressions, wow thats alot of game. Rules look interesting, will update after playing.
 First game was long, 4 players trying to figure out the different elements 
of the game. Overall impression was very good but need to play many more times.
 After an excellent 2 player game I raised my rating to 10. It is just such a thought provoking game with endless possiblities. After the game I just kept thinking about it and analizing how everything played out. I could play this game everyday.  After 22 plays, still find this one of the best 2 player strategy games I have ever played and the expansion makes the experience even better.

Pros - 1)components: lot of beautiful plastic miniatures 2) lot of dice and cards 3)excellent game flow: during a turn, players quickly alternates doing different actions and there are a lot of things to do; after one turn is over, you are in frenzy and want to start a new turn to make other things, again and again and again... basically you reach the end of the game and your appetite of rolling dice and playing cards is far from being satisfied. 4)It drives you deep inside LoTR atmosphere.
Cons: 1)For first timers games last too much (it's fun but takes away a lot of time ). 2)Sometimes units can be mistaken for others: the color is ok I like that all units of the same faction are of the same color, but I would have liked a more different shape or some easier recognizable details.  Overall a very good game, a must for LoTR fans and a valuable one for the rest.

I desperately want to play this more but just have not been able to swing it.  I rarely end up with one other serious player and two or three hours.  I've played it a couple of times, just enough to become addicted.  I am concerned about balance issues with SA fighting strong along DEW.  I played both roles the other night to see if it was as broken as I've read here on BGG.  The elves dug in well in Lorien and it was not going to be a slam dunk for SA.  We'll have to see.

rating after 1 play -6
rating after 2 plays -6

should be my ideal game but feels like a generic war game with too many dice and generic units. the 'ring' thing has been abstracted to an unthematic side mechanic but the thing that really annoyed was the fact that all of each side's units were of the SAME colour making it v hard to see which were which. also the cards felt like they dicated ur tactics too much

update-have just got hold of a set where someone had painted each faction a separate colour so am going to give it a few more tries..

have done - played 3 more times as the fellowhip and...

rating after 5 plays - 6 (as goodies)

yep confirmed all my original feelings - will expand in detail later but suffice it to say i don't want to play as the goodies anymore - will try as evil next...

update - played it quite a few times now as both sides and it didnt get any better - the latest game confirmed my impressions (and gave me a new concern as it came down to the wire and instead of feeling much tension it just felt like whoever rolled better won).

likes:
action dice mech, theme, marching armies cross board, politics, ring as timer

dislike
too long for how much fun it is, to luck dependant (action dice, battle dice, hunt tiles, action cards), playing as fellowship is dull as half ur turns are spend just moving a ring along a track, playing as red is just bullying a weak guy

i cant even give this game a 6 cos it is just too long
i would play this occasionally if someone really wanted to but have no desire to play it again

so final rating after ~10 plays = 5

it isnt a very good game - is more akin to watching a film - if this is what u want and u LOVE LOTR then u may enjoy it - if not then NOT RECOMMENDED

Still waiting for my oldest son and/or daughter to reach the point where THEY can read the rules and teach the game to me!  This game is now (temporarily) out of print (12/2010) and teaches the lesson... just BUY the damn game. You can always sell/trade/burn-as-firewood later but if you DON'T buy the game and it goes OOP (oh, Battlelore, how I crave you), you'll then regret it even more so.

In my opinion, the best of the strategic game adaptations of Tolkien. Plays well with 2,3 0r 4. 

Plastic pieces are fiddly and too big but, the characters almost demand this.

The game can be decided by outright military victory, destruction of the ring or corruption of the ring bearer. Players have limited resources in their decks and must choose on which arena to focus.

Some of the rules are tough to resolve at first but, ultimately work well.

Have played it twice.  I'm not sure about balance but I've heard it's weighted towards Sauron.  Really great mix of decision making depending on die rolls.  Do I play a card or muster more troops, move the fellowship, search for the fellowship, build armies, move armies, etc.  Great game that requires a commitment of probably 5 hours or so.  Some of the troops and markers are a little similar and thus confusing but best design on the subject by a mile.

RATING: 8.9
15-06-2014. Rated WotR 1st edition a 8.9, version 2nd editions 9. Difference can be explained by the better and larger cards, bigger regions on the board ánd the better marking of VPs each stronghold is worth on the board.

04-03-2014. Finally played War of the Ring. Admittedly, I now rate my own copy of the first edition, but regardless the game is largely similar except some minor tweaks.

I adore this game. There is so much to do, and so many interesting things to do. Because we were both new to the game, I won on 4 military VPs, by attacking both Isengard and Moria. Epic! I survived by bringing my heroes there for extra battle dice. 

I advanced the fellowship a few spots, but then decided to attack the weakened spots, since Saruman had left Moria with 2 troops and Orthanc with one in an attempt to flank Gondor and Destroy Rohan. Neat!

Currently, I'm loving this game. I must say, that I am not yet sure on how/if my rating changes. But currently I love it and would really want to play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Only 1 play each of the quick-start and standard rules. But I don't see this hitting the table again.  The theme is pretty well integrated but mechanically it just feels like two games, an asymetric, more complex version of Risk on one side and a very race/push your luck game to destroy the ring without getting corrupted on the other side. I know that's what the last 2 books are like, basically 2 separate story lines, but I would have liked to see the Risk part perhaps simplified and the hunt aspect more interesting, with the Sauron player getting to use the Nazgul more actively to hunt and the Free Peoples player doing something more interesting than "I use a Character die to move the Fellowship forward one", and again, and again.

Very good game,rather hard to learn but once you get passed the learning curve easy enough. Except for the fellowship rules those are still a pain. Evil does seem to be a bit overpowered but not by that much. Would recomend getting the ares edition with the bigger version of the cards  very convinient.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
[b]October 2013 Gifted to a friend who is much more likely to play it[/b] - Will probably look into purchasing the 2nd edition in the future.

Must...play...more...If I had the time. It's complex, it takes a lot of time, and it takes a lot of space.

But, the complexity gives it so much flavor and really helps to model the politics and the struggles depicted in the book. The breadth of the game feels truly epic as you struggle to fight a successfull delaying action or impose your will with extreme brutality on the rest of the world. The space the game occupies as well as the detailed miniatures as well as the use of the cards and map really add to the epic feel.

As a Tolkien fan, I love it. As a guy who loves ameritrash type wargames, I think it successfully depicts an assymmetric war that both sides have a chance to win. There are heroic last stands, brutal combats, gallant heroes, unforgiving decisions, tide turning events, and a hellish gamble of a journey against all odds.

The liklieness of the Shadow sacking multiple free peoples cities is very likely, even though they didn't take any in the books. Thematically, that's one of the big differences with the books, but I believe it's okay in this game as it gives a lot of tension to the game.

If you've got time and an interest in the theme or an interest in this type of war game, give it a try. I've thoroughly enjoyed my couple plays.

The best possible war game theme, for my tastes. Also, the best mechanics and components. I don't have much else to say about this game. It's a masterpiece.

Seems a bit scripted. Could be more interesting with a changing set-up. Recruitment is woefully slow, and this makes taking casualties a real pain. And some of the SP card that cause automatic casualties seem very harsh.

RATING: 5
dropping and dropping. Quickly down to a point where I (almost) always refuse to play. Gorgeous and superbly themed, yes. But there's so much not to like: Playing and set-up time is beyond excuse (less would've been MUCH more). The rules are UNNECESSARILY complex, nothing is solved elegantly. The German translation is errenous. The lay-out of the board is crappy to say the least, regions and settlements impossible to make out. But worst of all, I have a huge problem with two fundamental concepts of the game: The action dice are quite frankly a bad idea. And the strategy cards are a pain in the ass. Either nearly useless or game-clinching, it's important when they pop up RANDOMLY.  And then game-breaking events are decided by dice.  All games I've played so far have been decided by a serious of fortunate dice rolls. I like that in a 45-minute romp, but in a 4 hour game it's quite frankly intolarable to me.  Sad to see that so much potential has been wasted.

Tried to play this game twice with different people, and both times didn't finish it.  It took way too long, and we gave up on it.  And this was after I read the rules for several hours.  Very frustrating.  And I spent a ton of money on the game.  Very frustrating.  And my box was all beat up and the store owner wouldn't give me a discount even though the game box was all smashed in because he said it was such a good game and it was back ordered for months.  Very frustrating.  Probably never play it again, but I'll keep it for the miniatures, and just in case I ever decide to try it once more.  Very frustrating...

Lots of fun, but with a very specific traget audience - Tolkien fans that enjoy playing long-ish (2-4 hours), light wargames.  Yes, there is lots of dice-rolling, but there are enough strategic and/or tactical options to balance the luck.
Nicely balanced and incorporates a lot of the books into the game.

I really really love this game.  However, were it not for the love of the Tolkien universe, I may not like it so much.  It has real ambition, but some real design issues as well.  These are primarily component quality/aesthetic, as I see it.  It is very hard to discern/locate regions on the board.  I'm not so sure the "subtle earth tones" theme really works well for logistically for a board depicting a fictitious landmass with tons of borders--likewise, many pieces look identical upon initial glance, and are unpainted plastic that has been injection molded using material of the same color.  These are of so-so quality (or were with the intial release of the game, anyway)--about half of mine were warped or bent upon opening the box (these issues were apparently common to many copies upon release).  A game this expensive should have added a few bucks more and at least had pieces of unique color!!  Painting individual pieces would be perfect, but that would be monstrous for production and tedious for gamers who don't put that type of effort into their hundreds of games (like me!). Ok, enough grousing...it's very rich and detailed0--I doubt very much that many twelve year olds would find this game approachable--but there are no doubt some who would (particularly fans of combat/fantasy games, Tolkien fans, or both).  It's hard enough for me and my thirty/forty-something year-old friends with masters and PhDs to wrap our intellect around.  Still, I love the game, as I said.  Richly detailed, satisfyingly intricate, and not too long--one of those games where playing honestly gets a lot faster once players are more familiar with its turn mechanic (see my Turn Summary document for help with that!).

A thrilling 2-player battle that comes down to the wire and represents an engrossing narrative and back-and-forth conflict. The caveats: possibly a little unfair in favor of the bad guys, takes 4+ hours, and the 'introductory rules' are amazingly unfair and not much simpler than the full rule set. I look forward to playing this game many times more!

Truly captures the epic struggle of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings in a boardgame with very nice components. I've played this quite some times solo and only with two different real-life opponents (one game with the first, two with the second). I've taken the plunge and painted this game, this gave me extra 'bang for the buck' as I enjoyed it very much. It took me about seven month of painting (on and off during some weekends).

Simply put, if you love Lord of the Rings, you owe it to yourself to play War of the Ring. The game is intensely thematic, visually stunning (sometimes to the detriment of the usability of the game), and has lots of depth. Be prepared to fumble around a lot in your first game, as the rules are pretty intricate.

RATING: 8
My friend refers to WotR as a "historical simulation," and that's very much what it is. It's a tremendously successful effort at representing "what if" scenarios for the War of the Ring. The basic concept of the military and Ring victory conditions is quite clever and really motivates the game to follow courses that, while individually different, all seem appropriate for the story. 

The game does take a while to play, and I know that my appreciation of the setting, stories and movies makes that less annoying than it might be for a theme I didn't care about. It also has the "problem" that game time can vary rather a bit depending on how the game goes, but any wargamer ought to be used to this. Hand in hand with the potential length is the fact that a lot comes down to the endgame, which might frustrate you if the game has been long and you're not in it for the process of play. I've read reviews and game sessions where a game of WotR comes off as an exercise rather than an experience. For me, it's firmly in the experience category, as I think my session reports will attest. I'm not looking to figure out the optimal win strategy and then stick to it. I want to know what happens if the Easterlings strike at the Dwarves, or if the Fellowship sticks together to the bitter end to defender the Ringbearer. With that in mind, I won't become stuck in a rut and focus on the deficiencies of WotR rather than its strengths.

Overall, I really enjoy WotR and wish I had more time to play it.

As a kid I used to love the epic wargames, but now I'm more into the Euros.  This is an epic wargame with some Euro sensibilities; as importantly, it feels like an epic wargame should, even to someone (like me, believe it or not) who's not really into the whole Tolkien thing.

I've never gotten around to play this beauty, but I'm very impressed by the complexity of the rules (though the rules booklet could be better organized) and the miniatures (some of which, regrettably, came bent out of shape). The game reports I've read has made a favourable impression and I've got mates who play it regularly - but I haven't had time to jump in on a game yet.

Still, this one ranks above mid-range, until proven otherwise.

RATING: 7
There are lots of things in this game I like, but what I love is that every single game seems to be close because of the victory condition setup. In most of my games the Fellowship is poised to destroy the ring in Mount Doom, while Shadow is a few corruption points away from a ring victory himself, while also being ready to take his last settlement for a military victory. *Every* game I've played swells to a climactic dramatic finish. Once you know what you're doing, this game plays in 2-3 hours (not 4-5 marathons than people are complaining about). ***UPDATE: There are a few things which I don't like about this game, but what I hate is the compounded luck that can completely derail any attempt at strategic play. Dice rolls for your turn actions, random card draws (with many of different effectiveness than the others), dice rolls in combat, dice rolls in the hunt, random tile draws for hunt damage, and once you get to Mordor just total luckfest as to whether you draw a good or bad tile. The amount of luck in a "strategic" game this long is really ruining it for me. This started as an 8, rose to a 9, and is now falling towards a 7.

Its a race game, where the Fellowship is trying to dunk the ring while the Shadow is trying to conquer the free peoples. Strategy comes in as you try to speed yourself up and slow down the enemy. Fellowship can slow down the shadow by guessing where he is going to attack and mustering troops there, and by splitting off companions to these places to help fight. The Shadow can slow down the Free Peoples by hounding the fellowship with Nazgul and armies (for rerolls) and praying to god that he rolls good on his hunt rolls. But there is no depth to these strategies. "He is attacking Gondor...I guess my strategy should be...to muster in Gondor?" DUH! You don't decide your strategy either, the game does, by the cards you are given and the dice you roll. I actually go into the game thinking "If I draw this card I'll do this, if I get that card I'll do that". Right now, I'm still happy to play the game if someone asks. Once I start saying "um...lets play this instead", I'll drop this to a 7 (and despite all my moaning, I don't believe this game deserves less than that).

My summary of feelings on this game is very much what I feel about PlanetSide. The problem with both games is that they're unique, but just not very good. So if you want to play a game like them you've got no other alternatives. And thats the only thing that brings me back to each. ***ANOTHER UPDATE: Ok, I lied, I DO believe it deserves less than a 7. I will only ever play this game again if I can be the fellowship, and then I'll just go on autopilot, moving the fellowship as much as I can and mustering where its needed. The only thing I still like in the game are little dwarf figures. They are the funniest. ****FINAL UPDATE?: Replayed this game 3 times recently. Just does nothing for me anymore. Way too long for even setup let alone the game, I just get frustrated when I lose, and barely feel anything good if I win. The only thing that still attracts me to the game are the aesthetics. The figures are funny and the map is pretty.

Bought this to have a crack at painting the miniatures. Once finished, plunged in with the standard game, which went down surprisingly well with the missus. Beautifully produced game, clever and engaging mechanics. Knowledge of Middle-Earth geography and LOTR is very helpful, especially as map board is difficult to read once loaded with miniatures, but I didn't find the issues so bad as others. Took about 5 hours for our first game - had no idea how much time had passed. Exceeded expectations.

Shame about the lack of Gollum, Gandalf the White and Aragorn miniatures. Look forward to acquiring the expansion, hope the makers think up some other expansions or variations for the future. In many ways the core mechanics seem very similar to Blue Vs Gray - so a Civil War game or other historical conflict would be nice. This would surely be the mechanics and production values best suited to an epic Genghis Khan game!

I am honestly not obsessed with LOTR, but too many of the games are just so damned good.

Edit: upped rating to 10, which it is impossible to deny this game.

Not sure what I think of this game yet. I played one game as the Shadow Player, losing to a final hunt tile pluck that had a 40% chance of succeeding. I was a little saddened that after hours (and hours) of playing the game basically came down to a coin flip. Or maybe I'm just ticked that I had 9 victory points and was bearing down on the city of Dale with a military victory in my grasp... sigh! But anyhow, War of the Ring is seeping with theme; if you're a Tolkien fan, this game is an absolute must. The game has a number of interesting mechanisms, but despite them (or because of them) there is a tremendous amount of luck to contend with. Action dice rolls shape your possible course of actions, which is cool. The cards you draw and when you draw them can have a significant effect on your game, which is not all that cool, but I can see that knowing what ALL the cards are could help you plan ahead, and possibly mitigate the luck somewhat. I don't like that there are certain critical game moments with severe consequences that require a lucky roll to surpass. I felt fairly hopeless as Sauron to hinder the fellowship's journey, there's just so much luck involved. I discovered as time went on that there were some subtle, defensive things I could do, but it's maddening to watch to ring-bearers zip through your lines like you're invisible. The "fellowship hidden movement" system was a fascinating implementation that borrows from Schroedinger's Cat. You invest in move points, which increase your range of "how far the ring bearers are away from their last known position", and then at some point you declare which region they're actually in. It's bizarre, it's "collapse the probability wave." Frodo's Cat. Anyhow, I'm rambling. There's a lot to this game, and a hefty learning curve. It's worth another play to figure out how I really feel.

Lengthy setup (60 minutes)

Pros:
Beautiful components and board
Once the rules are understood on both sides, this game plays very smoothe.
Outstanding 1 v 1 wargame.  Best ive played in my opinion.
Strategies, replayability, and decisions are endless.
Theme is outstanding, and the game can easily be recapped as a wonderful story afterwards with heroic deaths, locations and often similiarties to the books/movies.

I would only recommend this game to experienced gamers who enjoy war games and have tiem to site down for a lengthy session.

I assumed this game's high rating was mostly hype, I was wrong. I'm not a huge LotR fan, I could take or leave the theme,  however this game does a very good job of capturing the flavor of the subject matter.  If you are mildly interested in the theme, this will probably grab you. If you don't like LotR, then it won't. If you don't like longish games, you won't like it. If you don't like any fiddly rules, you won't like it. However, if you like a well grafted theme, you don't mind the occassional long playing game, and if you like light to medium wargames or don't mind extra "flavor" rules, then give this a try.

[url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/428901/a-timeless-epic-struggle]My review is here[/url].

Ignoring the theme, this is already a tough, excellent game, which presents agonizing decisions involving the dual-purpose cards and innovative mechanism of action dice. Add on the Lord of the Rings theme, and this game is an automatic 10, because the theme is integrated so seamlessly, so beautifully with the mechanisms. Look through your discard piles after you finish the game, and you can visualize an alternative history of Middle-Earth that is different from what you know, yet entirely plausible. I have seen the theme fester on the emotions of the players: both players start out joking about the theme and noting how cool it is as they do things that just "make sense". Then the chatter dies a slow and eerie death as the shit hits the fan. The FP player feels the tension first, the despair of a defensive war fought on too many fronts and with too little in reserve, and the frustration of the dice going horribly wrong in a siege (the FP player always gets REALLY moody midway during the game). This culminates in an ultimate crisis of faith when he realizes there's no way in hell he's going to win. Then he remembers Frodo and Sam with renewed urgency. All this sound familiar? This roller-coaster of emotions will happen to the FP player in the game, no matter how prepared you are for it. Soon later, the Shadow player feels a different sort of tension, an annoyance at that little Fellowship cockroach evading capture time and again and bringing your bomb closer, and impatience at those unexpected delays you keep incurring while trying to gain that decisive victory and break. That. Stronghold.

The genius of the game is the asymmetry of the two sides perfectly capturing the situation in the novels and movies. This is a war fought on two fronts - the military domination of Middle-Earth and the hunt for the Ring - with each side having the initiative in one of them, and an outside chance at a secondary victory if the opponent screws up. The Free Peoples start in disarray, reluctant to fight, while the Shadow is able to muster its full strength early, yet must step carefully to avoid provoking the Free Peoples to band together. The fascinating concept in the divergent goals is that of time. Both sides possess a ticking time bomb which they attach to the other at the start of the game, and the loser is the side whose time runs out first. The Shadow player tightens the temporal noose through military victories, while the FP player challenges the Shadow player to quickly level those surprisingly resilient strongholds through movement of the One Ring. Both sides have limited capability to extend their time limit a little bit for some breathing room: the FP through hapless defenses barely thrown together in the nick of time; and the Shadow through a focus on the Ring and a blighting on the probable path the Fellowship is taking. But do not be tempted to simply react and forget your goal. The winner is always he who made his opponent's bomb tick faster.

The struggle of time (or rather, this timeless struggle!) is delicate and snowballs from tiny innocuous actions (or lack thereof). Huge momentum swings happen during the game as the little things done or not done add up through subtle means (mostly through action dice effects). Momentum will swing back and forth 2-4 times in the game, and the key is to seize that pendulum and never let it go again.

In no other game is the flow of war so drastic, so devastating, and so riveting. "Game" doesn't do War of the Ring justice. This is an epic.

5+5

Really, I should dock this 0.5 because of some questionable decisions regarding the components, and because this version can suck it next to my COLLECTOR'S EDITION.

I have played several top ranked boardgames (Puerto Rico, the Princes of Florence, Advanced Squad Leader, Carcassone, Settlers of Catan, Shadows over Camelot to mention only few), but this was something... bigger... something epic. Finally a game that really has captured the spirit of the great Lord of the Rings, even better than those nice P. Jackson movies.  Yes, I am a Tolkien fan, but I'm not a war game fan (or at least I wasn't before this one). The only fault in the WotR is the long duration of the game (and putting all those figures to the board before the game), so I'm not able to play it as often as I would like. But it's worth of waiting and all the preparations! Clearly the best boardgame I've ever played!

[2 plays]  This is a very good game. Very nicely themed to the stories and extremely well designed. Seems to be balanced both in terms of who can win and also in terms of fun to play either side. I might rate this a 9 or 10 if it played in half the time - but rating it as highly as I do in spite of that should give a good indication that this is a game worth playing if you get the chance.

games can vary greatly based on a few lucky card draws and dice, so the length can be wildly variable.  Played one game where Sauron lost in about 8 turns.  There is a good hidden movement (after the fact) system that kinda works, although it could have been done better with some record keeping.

Outstanding game, one of the best games I have ever played. I liked the way the shadow player will be able to pursue a northern strategy in trying to take strongholds and cities on the top part of the map as well as the normal ones like Helm's Deep. The shadow player has some tuff decisions of how to best use his die. I have not played it enought but it seems the the best way for victory for the free player is to get the ring to Modor since the free player will run out of troops in the long run. The game componants are beautiful and funcional. The cards at my age are a bit hard to read. A delightful game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.75
WotR is my sentimental favorite as it was my introduction to true Geek-dom. The narrative and immersion is tops. I regard this game so highly that it's easier to ask, so, why not a perfect score? The 2nd Edition re-ignited my zeal for this game, but there are remaining negatives:
 
- The card-management aspect of the game is the weak spot for me; This is my biggest source of analysis-paralysis. It's simpler for the Shadow since that side has more dice resources; but the Free Peoples have to be much more discrete. The use/discard decisions are often difficult and bogs down the gameplay. 

This is exacerbated by the fact that the cards serve a dual purpose as battle modifiers. Also, effects of cards played on the table are often forgotten. This all serves to busy an already complicated game. Maybe my brain is too small to optimize the cards' use. This make Hulk angry. Hulk smash.
 
- The game is so epic and expansive that sessions can last several hours and lead to gaming fatigue. In a tight game, the machinations of climbing Mt. Doom could play out like the bottom half-inning a pivotal baseball game that's already stretched 13 innings. (You'd think you'd love that, but sometimes you don't. Sometimes you just want to call it a night or play a different game.)

RATING: 5
Based on one play, I found it considerably lacking. Risk-style combat, cards full of fiddly and unbalanced rules, open-ended meaninglessness to the die rolls, nice but completely unmanageable art (FP cities, towns - what?). Stunned by how this has taken BGG by storm on the strength of a lot of nice looking minis that all have the same combat strength. I'll play it more so I can get a better assessment but my gut is that this game is seriously overrated.

The rules take a bit of reading, but the combination of cards and action dice captures the theme beautifully and allows for a variety of strategies. I especially like the hidden movement mechanic for the hobbits. Two small quibbles are that the game can sometimes end abruptly and the Mt. Doom endgame is played essentially on autopilot. Granted, I am a LOTR fan, but this is an excellent game.

RATING: 9
A really good game for two players. WotR has captured the theme remarkable well. Playing as the free people you actually do feel desperate when the hordes of Mordor & Isengard start to close in. As the player of the dark forces you are militarily superior, but have to allocate recourses to find that blasted ring.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A tough one to rate.  There's just WAY too much going on here for my taste BUT unlike other Mulligan stew games, all the stuff in this game works pretty well together.  Also, while the game plays out much too militarily to give an satisfying feel for the books, there is still plenty of tension vis a vis the dunking of the ring.  If I have time for more plays it will be interesting to see if more knowledge of the cards will add strategy or if they will be revealed as simply adding more luck (and unneeded complexity) to the battles.  The components are amazing, but frustrating in some aspects (telling the units or the towns apart, for instance). There is no denying that this game is a tour de force, and I completely understand how many people who are into rich complex games would love it, it just isn't quite my style.

180 minutes is only realistic if everyone knows the game well.
Possibly, this is quite a good game. Maybe. With the right group and if everyone knows the game well.
The game is not good, if it is not well taught. It is impossible to get into the game as it progresses. One has to know everything from the start on, otherwise forming a strategy is impossible.
The map is confusing and too small to accomodate the figures. The iconography is not the most intuitive.
Not for me.

There are times in life when all you really want to do is crush a hobbit or two, send some Uruk-Hai out on a rampage across the country-side and replay those scenes from the movie in your head as you send forth Nazgul on fellbeasts to wreck things.

Or you can play for the side of light.

This game scratches that itch and does it masterfully. There has been a lot of discussion on the balance and strategy in this game so I won't go into that, except to say that every game of WotR has felt both satisfying and as though I had a fighting chance of winning whichever side I played. Thematic, engaging and sprawling - this won't get played often, but it never fails to deliver when it does.

In a nutshell, this brings Middle Earth, the place where I would like to be, to life. 

It is well conceived (driven by an innovative dice mechanics), very well developed and rather well balanced too (maybe slightly favouring the Shadow, which has definitely been fixed in the second edition). Gameplay is tense and, to me, engaging like nothing else. 

This game is the reason why I can't rate anything else a 10.

RATING: 8
Ok, so I decided to give this game another chance and I realized as I was playing it that it was just so much more fun for me to play the forces of Darkness than the Fellowship.  After putting time into the game I have had the chance to see how enjoyable it really is.  Perhaps my opinion will change about the Fellowship eventually, but mostly it seems like you just take a beating and hope to hold out until you slam dunk the ring into the mountain.

Yes, the dice mechanic was done first in Minos and questionably better.  But there usually are a number of great options available with what you roll. The reason I can't give a higher rating for this is that a couple bad action rolls can be devastating.  The system does have the potential to clump in awkward ways (Mordor/Fellowship tile cards stuck at the bottom, no mustering in the begining, all muster at the end, no swords rolled etc.)  

I have a love/hate relationship with the cards.  I tend to not like a bunch of crap on a bunch of cards in games. On one hand the cards add excitement and color, but really slow the pace of the game down and often you are reliant on good draws.

Regardless, it is quite fun and beautifully evocative.

I convinced my brother to give this game a shot, and he quit halfway through; I was trying hard not to, myself.  This is the most rules-heavy boardgame I have ever seen or heard of, one that literally had me exhausted after reading the rulebook.  The bits are nice, and I get the feeling that there's a good game in there somewhere, but you have to have some really determined players to get anywhere.

I'll improve my rating if I ever get to play again, and I find that it's better.

Edit: Played it with a good friend.  We mastered the rules and played a few times, and it's become one of my most favorite games.  Excellent game, excellent.

I've enjoyed this game very much: several options, well-balanced, good components (except for the color choices of the figures, the small text on the cards, and the not-so-obvious nationality symbols), and good sense of theme. The rulebook could be a little better organized, but the FAQ answers all the points of confusion.

My only negative is that lots of the gameboard doesn't seem to get into play. (We've changed that by permitting an end-of-turn movement of unengaged army units of one space as long as the army is 5 units or less, and doesn't begin or end next to enemy units/settlements.)

Updated note: use the Battles of the Third Age expansion and play with the rules straight out of the box!

RATING: 6
Certainly I get the appeal from the standpoint of Lord of the Rings fans, but for me, the game was too long and too fiddly for a fair bit of randomness. It seems that there is a bit of an asymetrical race between the two sides, and that the draw is in deciding how much you try to slow down what the other side is good at versus what you are trying to accomplish (meaning how much do you try and stop the Fellowship as Mordor, and how much do you try to fight the war to hold off the marauding monsters of Mordor). It's got some nice thematic elements to it, but I think that Chaos is a far better game in this genre.

Jury is still out on this one. I've only played a few times. It just doesn't scratch the CDG itch the way I would like it to. For all the cards in the game there are too many repeats. Maybe I'm just spoiled by other CDGs like the Napoleonic wars and Sword of Rome. Some of cards are particular so it can become frustrating trying to have the right conditions meet. I don't mind that the game may be unbalanced.

After playing some, the rating has gone up. Good  game.

Mar 2005: Haven't played a full game - just got a demo (very poorly run!) at GenCon '04. While it has some interesting mechanics - the race to destroy the ring, the Shadow's search for the fellowship - it seems to be too much of a wargame for me. There are just way too many little pieces on the board. Plus, each country is so small that the hordes don't easily fit (and the "solution" of using chits isn't very good)! It may be better as a 2-player game. We played with 4, and had a hard time figuring out which armies belonged to each player. Why use such ugly colors? Why make every good/evil piece the same color? Couldn't Saruman/Sauron and Rohan/Gondor/etc be, at the very least, different shades to facilitate 4-player games?

4/10

Sep 2011: 2er, full game, with someone who knows the rules.
MUCH better! The physical production is still a bit iffy -- pieces don't fit in regions, Nazgul are top heavy and need pennies glued to the bottoms to keep them standing, etc. -- but the game play is greatly improved playing this as a 2-player game. Gameplay is very evocative of the theme and story. And there are some very cool mechanisms here: 
- the dice-driven action selection narrow the scope of what you can do, which is good for a non-wargamer!, but _should_ average out over time
- the search for the Fellowship by reducing your dice pool ... very nice! In fact I like pretty much everything about how the Fellowship is handled: it must break over time, as people are forced to split off to do things; terrific semi-hidden movement system that is both simple and effective in hiding exact location without becoming cumbersome; how Sauron catches glimpses as they move, are found, then hide again.
- event cards and dice sort of remind me of card-driven (war)games like Twilight Struggle, which BTW is an awesome game!
- combat is tough! Clever to have Sauron's forces unlimited, but have the Free Peoples succumb to attrition through the game.
- pretty simple turn structure, really, for such an involved game
- the final push up Mount Doom to destroy the ring is appropriately tense!

I'm not sure how much I will like it in the long run, though: there are an awful lot of dice rolling here and I tend not to like those types of games. And the game is somewhat long, although that isn't necessarily a problem for me. But looking forward to trying it again!
7/10?

RATING: 8
Absolutely dripping with theme. Personally I find the luck well balanced. There's just enough dice rolling to feel like you're balancing out bad luck without turning the game into a dicefest, and the cards, although varying in usefulness do not feel overpowered in the context of the game.

I am slightly wary about limited strategy options, but as I never bought the game intending to play it 50 times in as many days, we probably won't be hitting the problem until long after I've had very good value for money from it.

Quite a fun, tense game that really evokes the feel of the LotR novels.  I do have two complaints that drop the rating, however:

1)  For a game that should take about 2 hours, you have to factor in about an hour for setup and teardown -- so in that respect, I'm not sure the payoff is really worth the amount of time spent NOT playing the game itself.

2)  Some of the pieces are VERY fiddly, in particular the Nazgul, which really don't want to stand up.  And while I get the point of the tokens for stacking multiple units, the board still gets rather cluttered rather fast, and moving large armies can be a pain in the ass.

Still, lots of fun here, though I don't think I'd pick WotR over something like Twilight Struggle if given my druthers.

I'm not very familiar with wargames or fantasy themed games, so I had reservations despite the high ratings.  After an initial basic two-player session, wow!  I love the mechanics, the dice, the decisions, and the cool looking pieces.  I definitely want to play again soon and I have a feeling my rating might actually go up even further.

An excellent long wargame, despite the graphic design flaws (small font on cards, figures hard to distinguish).  Note to the Eurogamers: if you don't like long war games, stay away.  To anyone else, this is a fine game that should allow many replays.  It reminds me of The Napoleonic Wars, another game I rated a "10."  I've been looking for a good fantasy wargame for over 35 years, and this is the first game that I feel qualifies!

Twice played after the introduction rules which were already fun. 
Ine time played with complex rules.
Unfortunatly it isn't that easy to see the difference between your armies. This could have been done better. Also the colors from the borderlines are sometimes hard to see. Even more the difference between towns, citys and fortifications.
With the exceptions from the above points this is a great game and I'm looking forward to have my next game.

RATING: 7.4
Setup takes a bit too long to bring it to the 
table.

But the game immerses you in Middle Earth at
the start of the war. With you making critical
decisions over the fate of Middle Earth. 

It's can be a bit overwhelming to keep track of 
all your units and the underlining strategies
of the cards/tactics. But still a great game.

RATING: 6
Moderately complex, but then so is the topic.  Despite being designed by Italians, it has a very "big-box american" feel to it.  The rules will run kind of fitfully until you've had some practice.  I recommend a couple of solo games before you sit down with any opponents; this will cut down on rules hunting.  Does a remarkable job of integrating the story into the war.  The Howe artwork is first-rate; the map is truly beautiful, although this comes at some cost to its functionality.

RATING: 10
This game is about as good as it gets in my mind.  A good mix of war and fantasy.  Plenty of bits.  Good models and gameplay.  I first felt that Mordor is a little too powerful, but overall the game is pretty balanced.  I love the devastation when the evil player knows the fellowship is close to the chasm in mount doom. The gameboards are very nice as well.

RATING: 7.5
I have had this on my want list forever and then it went out of print and became difficult to find.  So I was really exited when I got it in a math trade.  The two sides have wildly different powers but seem to be balanced as I have played twice and each side has won.  Fellowship and the hunt is integrated very well and each side has to balance hunting for the ring/moving the fellowship vs. performing war actions.  It requires more play fomr me as the couple games I played lacked tension for whatever reason and I think this type of game needs tension.

Aah, expanded Risk for two players/teams. War of the Ring is unwieldy: a board that is both too large and too small, complicated rules for a game that isn't really hard, and a production that is way over the top, yet not functional.

Still, I had a lot of fun playing this. Would want to play this more, but wouldn't know with whom. Sad, really.

RATING: 10
A superb treatment of the novel; better than I ever expected to see. The dynamics between the military game and the simultaneous quest game make an intriguing play experience. Only downside is that new players must invest some time absorbing the rules and play two or three times before understanding enough to play without feeling lost.

In my opinion this was a breakthrough design, one which demonstrated that in some cases an entirely new approach can be clearly superior to a top shelf hex and counter wargame design. Richard Berg and SPI put their all into their War of the Ring game, and at one time I owned the deluxe mounted map edition. It wasn't as good as this game; not even close.

RATING: 3
The game takes way too long to begin with.  Perhaps if I were to play again, the strategy would come through, but I don't like investing that much time into a single game.  

Warning:  there is a high screwage factor where the dice are concerned.  Your actions can be severely limited if the dice say so, and thats just not all too fun.  Don't understand how someone could rate this as a ten.  

I'm growing tired of listening to people talk about this game.  There are a whole 200 people that like this game, and those that have so far bought the game(only fans have bought it by the way) think that it is the second coming.  

Well, it's not.  This game is so lacking that it's not even funny.  WOTR is an average game at best, not top 50 worthy, and CERTAINLY not top 10 worthy.  Over time, when non-tolkien drones have a chance to play, this game will take a nose dive in average rating.

A very successful marrying of strong theme with strong mechanics. Easily my favorite 'war' game (I don't count Twilight Imperium as a war game - war is only one tool in that game to achieve victory points.) It's the action dice and the asymetrical goals that really make this game for me. The action dice really ensure there is very little down time as each player takes many smaller actions in turn. Upon completion, I was immediately looking forward to its next play.

RATING: 9
Wow!!  WOW!!!!  What a truly EPIC game!!  This is my favourite board game of all time for 2 players (although when I don't have several hours to commit to a game, [thing=21763][/thing] is my favourite board game of all time for 2 players), particularly  when combined with the expansion elements of "Battles of the Third Age", and when played with BGG user Jimzik's "Starting from the Shire" variant (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/111865).  It is also about the most complex board game that I could ever tolerate playing, and it would certainly be too long and complex for me if I wasn't such a big Lord of the Rings fan.  The level of complexity really brings the books to life, but if you are not a fan of heavy games or are not a Lord of the Rings fan, you will probably want to avoid this one.  And it certainly is a beast to just get to the table - prior to our first game I spent dozens of hours spray-painting the minis, reading and re-reading and re-re-reading the rulebooks and FAQs in an attempt to wrap my head around the countless rules exceptions, searching BGG for player aids and rules summaries, and scavenging from other games for settlement markers and other game pieces.  The problem is, despite being an absolutely incredible game, the graphic designers have seemingly done everything in their power to confound the novice player - everything from monochromatic figures, to map regions that are too small to fit the figures, to barely discernible nation borders, to settlement symbols and region names that fade into the board background, to bizarre nation symbols on the political track and elsewhere, to minuscule card text that requires a magnifying glass, to a terribly organized rulebook, make this a very difficult and frustrating game from a visual standpoint.  I've gone to the extensive effort of correcting most of these problems with my game, and the work was definitely worthwhile (you can do the same - have a look here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/38850).  If you have one willing opponent and several hours to set up and play through a game, it simply does not get better than this!  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 5/5  Total: 9/10

Does a superb job of capturing the look and feel of the novels in a tight war game.  The rules are rather meaty, so that will take some time to learn.  Also the game can easily run 3-4 hours.  Despite these issues, the game is rather fun to play.  The only gripe I have is that it seems to me too easy for the fellowship to progress on the map.  Maybe I am just not a very good player with the forces of Sauron, I'll have to see.  I also find it frustrating that you can only do one round of siege combat in a territory per turn unless you sacrifice an elite unit.  I think a few tweaks are necessary with the rules to take this game from good to excellent.

Theme play awesome!  takes a couple of plays to learn.  It will take several plays to learn the Free Peoples' strategy.  Components awesome.  Game play - not so good.  The military aspect becomes inconsequential.  The Free Peoples only hope for victory is to destroy the ring, since military conquest is near impossible due to the starting position of the political track, limited amount of units, and military disposition of Shadow forces.  Unfortunately, it does not take much resources for the Shadow player to corrupt the ringbearer.  The Companions (heroes) seem underpowered and the game very scripted.  Game length is extremely long and entirely too long for what it has to offer.  I'm a big fan and wanted to like this game but very disappointed.

If I had a gaming table this would be set up on it. A great game that recreates the story so well, and allows for loads of what if moments for fans. Love the books, love the films, love the game. Only down side is it took me probably eight hours of reading and copying out the rules to really begin to understand what to do - the rulebook layout could have been a lot better than it is. Worth every minute of the effort though.

Update 2017 - Great game, but I don't get chance to play, and the rules overhead coming back into this is pretty high.

Great theme, figures and map. I am still waiting for a serious 2 player game of this, my son found it too long and didn't like the combat rules. So have only played it Solo since, as a Solo game it is especially good because of the Custom dice adding variety to every game. 
The most satisfying part is sneaking the Fellowship into Mordor.

Only a 9 because of the combat rules, which I don't like; I would prefer some simple version of wargame type rules. I suppose that could be fixed with house rules, but the Elite/Regular set-up complicates that.

The theme is really the saving grace. It's a pretty poor game otherwise. It's just... the same game every time, as far as I can see. 

Yes, I know that criticism could be made of a LOT of games, and of quite a few that I like. War of the Ring just doesn't seem to offer a particularly varied play experience. The game almost feels too short; there is not enough time for a game to begin to develop before the ring has been dunked in Mordor (or not).

This game... I used to think the Shadow always won. Last six games, the Free Peoples have won. Every game is different - every game a struggle. If you like LoTR and wargames - this one is a must. Its a deep game - I've played it over 15 times and I still have to consult the rules book everytime I play. It's a long game too - usually 4 hours or so. I think it's best as a two player game. Simply put - I'm hooked! I love this game!

Wow. I can see why people like this a lot. Simple but interesting wargame spiced up to the point of brilliance with cards, clever systems and evidently classy development and testing. We liked the combat system, sieges, tight rules, diplomacy, fellowship... well, everything really. The Hunt rule, with the hidden hobbits, is the best bit. Superb design here. I was really, really impressed. Excellent and believable narrative, tough game, almost draining. Came right down to the wire with the game turning on some AMAZING card sequences and a quick rub down with athelas. The event cards are truly excellent - lots of work went into these. A very clever and rewarding game, on all levels. I am guessing 4 hours, but may be shorter with experience.

Felt too restricted for me, which I suppose would change if I gave the game more time. I just didn't get that 'this seems to have depth' vibe.
Sorry!

The amount of rules (for this type of game) turned me off too. To their defence I SUCK at reading and my memory is not to be admired either :D

Did not finish my first game, yet i can see a great game within. A must-have in a 'Lord of the Ring' fan's collection.

Played the full game with Ivan and Jason. Perfect theme match, unique mechanisms and player interaction between oppositions. Only minor issue is the long play time.
Perfect in almost everyway. Ratings from 8 raised to 9.5.

A very good strategy game that offers 2 ways for winning: crush your opponent in a military campaign, or destroy the ring (or the fellowship, if you play Sauron).
This game really brings the book (or films) to life, and the artwork and miniatures are the beautiful icing on top of this nice game.

RATING: 7
I enjoyed both times I played this game, however the odds of having the time and finding someone to play with are small enough that it only gets the chance about twice a year.  The rules are complex enough that it usually means me rereading the entire thing.  Thus the fun ratio does not equal the effort involved to get it out.  If I were back in college I could do it, but with five kids... it isn't going to happen.  Traded.

Could be fun given enough time, with the right group, but it is too long and too complicated (or the rules are too confusing) to make it something that will get played.  I had one shot with my wife and daughter and they didn't like it. My wife realy likes Axis and Allies, so it did have a chance.  This could be a good game, but I think it's highly overrated.

RATING: 9
Phenomenal game - amazing how the game captures the feel of epic battle between two completely different foes.  A brilliant siege system, a cool win mechanic (transporting the ring to Mount Doom), loads of bits... this is a grand wargame that should appeal to Ameritrash and strategy wargamers alike.

I don't know about this one. Very thematic and intense but too many dice throws and card or tile draws to keep my interest in the game. I don't want dice or (un)lucky draws make decisions for me, I want to be able to say that winning or losing a game was because of ME, not because of my good or bad luck. Especially if I play game for 5+ hours, I don't want luck of the draw decide the outcome of the game. It's just far too long: our first game took about 5,5 hours. Interesting game which I could be lured to play every now and then.

Perhaps too epic. I like it, but finding someone to play with is nearly impossible. Somehow others lose interest when I say "Don't worry about the rules. Yes there's a lot, but we'll just play a game using these simpler rules first, and then we can play it for real."

If there's a game that betters War of the Ring in terms of delivering a fantastic, nail-biting experience while expertly balancing narrative and strategic gameplay, I haven't tried it (Update: I've at least now played its equal and it's Twilight Struggle).  Many strategy games tend to make concessions when it comes to theme to ensure the mechanics are accessible to new players, or the thematic elements are only pin-on dressings with just a tenuous attachment to what the player is actually doing.  Not so, here.  This game drops the players right in the middle of a warring Middle Earth.  The players are first and foremost competing for victory, but every single action taken towards this goal compound to create an exciting and engaging alternate telling of the Lord of the Rings epic.  When playing, I keep switching between grinning like a kid because of the cool situations that are unfolding and scratching my head trying to decide what would be the best course of action.

There are some nitpicks about the production quality that can be made (small text on the event cards, awkward board for handling so many pieces, overly esoteric and subtle symbols to differentiate regions and nationalities) but, really, these don't detract from my enjoyment of the game one iota as these problems are greatly outweighed by what this gorgeous production does right.

(My one worry: I hope the first 95% of the game isn't essentially pointless and that the victor isn't always decided by luck of the draw once (if) the Fellowship enters Mordor.)

UPDATE: The game is surprisingly good with 4 players.  I wouldn't have expected that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Very well balanced game. One game session was decided by one single die. That is not to stress dice luck in this game rather to show how close this game can be.  Altough playing the good guys without the expansion feels slightly tougher. Yet, even without the expansion, the good side has its chances. Well-done game-testing

Runs real long so far, but an incredible sense of immersion and narrative.  I need to start playing earlier in the evening.

Edit: Rating bumped.  The time flies by and I'm mesmerized from start to finish.  The balancing act between the ringbearers and the military struggle is always agonizing and I feel like every game I play of this is a close one.  Really, really captures the feel of the source material -- defiant stands against overwhelming odds, darkness everywhere, a palpable sense that time is running out.  Beautiful.

A very good game, highly recommended. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
War of the Ring has a lot going for it, but if I can name only 1 thing that stands out, it's this: You're IN the books/movies, living the story and seeing how it could have evolved instead.

Whereas the Free Peoples Player has to work with nations that don't want to go to war, limited resources and ultimately gambling a lot on the Fellowship, the Shadow Player has a big but slow army, and needs to divide his resources between the military, and the hunt for the ring. It's a brilliant recreation of the story, and it works.

Most of the exciting stuff that happened in the books can be reproduced in the game, but the game's also open enough to allow many different events to occur.

If there's a drawback, it's that the various systems themselves (the political track, the hunt...) are too complicated, and could have been simplified. As it stands, every time there's a chance this game will hit the table, I have to restudy many of its systems. And that's a big drawback unfortunately.

I let this one go . . . reluctantly.  Great bits, interesting concepts if a bit more luck-driven than I like.  (I like the action dice, but in a game this big and in-depth, they seem out of place.)

Rating based on 1 play.

No real problem with rules, but did have FAQ.

Beautiful game and deep play.

If you love Lord of the Rings then you should at least TRY this even if you are not a wargamer or a heavy gamer.  It has loads of theme. 

I imagine this is immersive and loads of fun as you get more comfortable with it.  I look forward to getting there!

Update: 3 more plays and the rating moves to an 8.  The game is obviously well designed and brings it's subject matter to life about as well as one could hope.  There are a LOT of little rules that seem to be included primarily for sake of theme.  I wonder if these could be trimmed without effecting gameplay significantly.  I am waaaay to new to this game to make an informed judgement about that.

I can see the rating moving up to a 9 or back to a 7.5 depending on how fast future games play, but it will likely never be lower than 7.5.   



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 1


Overall - 1 (The anti-Travel game. There is no way to even try to make this a reasonable travel size)

This is a great game. Excellent balance between "ring" choices versus "battle" choices. A more perfect game would have had "event" cards that were painted/illustrated effects (instead of the symbolic pictures), and more miniatures that reflected the strategic balance of the book. (Like the "ghost army".) 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Though this game is a little longer than what is normally practical for me these days, it does a better job of immersing you in the world of the Lord of the Rings than any other game I've seen.  The huge number of detailed miniatures and the large board contribute to the epic feeling of the game.  Highly recommended to any Lord of the Rings fans.  The multiple facets to the game, including the political side and the progression of the fellowship make the game much more interesting.  Well balanced between the two sides even though they really have completely different goals, methods, and strategies.  Lots of strategic/tactical options but with enough luck to keep the game interesting down to the very ending in most cases.  One of the few games I'm glad I bought new.

I find this game is a brilliant combination of more 'elegant,' euro-style mechanics and wargame feel.  The theme is incredibly strong, and you can play out events that just "feel" dramatic, while at the same time, the effect of luck on the game is fairly minimal.

Certain strategic degeneracies, however, prevent me from rating it a 10.  That, and the fact it is not for everyone.  *I* think the rules are reasonably elegant, but others still think they're overwhelming and clunky.  In terms of how often I want to play it, it is definitely a 10.

The best board game that I own, and the only one with a 10 rating.

A lot of set up initially. Took around 20 minutes for a first play. Rules are fairly simple and I found it easy to get stuck in right away. Once I worked out what I was doing strategically the game was an absolute blast. The game oozes theme and allows for a high level of player interaction. What I thought would be an easy victory for the Shadow player ended up being a very narrow win to the Forces of Good as the fellowship reached Mount Doom. I can see this game resulting in a tight finish on most plays. The components are excellent and the artwork on the game board and cards is of the highest quality. My first play took a little under 3 hours, so I can see an average game taking about 2 hours. I'll definitely be playing this again and therefore highly recommend it. True Ameri-trash fun incarnate.

A good strategy/war game with a few extras on the side (Fellowship quest) which adds another dimension. While I definitely like the game, the strategy has a high learning curve. I think that it can go on a little long for what it is, making it less appealing to grab and play and making it easier to "burn out" from and have to let it sit on the shelf for a while before pulling it down again.

Did not like the back and forth mechanics with no real feeling of moving the game forward.  Unlike a lot of other new 'big wargames', there's no turn mechanic, no inevitable accumulation of victory points, so I had the feeling we weren't really going anywhere.  Maybe if I just played a 2 player game with a friend and didn't mind a longer game, this would be fine.

Only one game so far. I liked it a lot. Only reason it's not rated higher is the luck factor. Our 6 hour game ended with drawing one hunt tile with about 50-50 odds who would be the winner.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Pretty damn good for the amount of replay I've gotten out of it.

For a card driven game it doesn't suffer too much from "memorize the deck or else!"  As long as you tell new players about a few key cards "don't leave Saruman alone if the ents are out!" "there is a card in here that lets an army with a leader move two spaces!" you should be fine.  Anyway, it is the most flavorful LOTR game I've played, and being the LOTR fan I am that is enough to move it to my top game list.

The main negative I can think of is that the free peoples may not be as fun to play for some.  You basically move the ring as much as you can and react to the Sauron player.  Not as much opportunity to plan cool strategies as shadow imo.

A good 7 that has a special place because it renders the story with brilliance. Only for Middle Earth lovers as it depends on that.

*

The Risk-like conflict mechanics are saved by the brilliant fellowship travel mechanic, different endgame conditions, card mechanics that grant different strategies & tactics game to game, and very well conceived flavor that provides the chrome more a feeling of depth than gloss. You can tell the design was built outword from the story, and if you love Tolkien it's a treat.

I painted the characters in detail, and gave the leaders of each group a monocolor paint job. And I replaced the elite and regular troops with dyed wood discs & squares, matching their colors. This vastly improves the readability of the gamestate - it no longer looks like a crowded bus - and imho the aesthetics are improved.

Played once at Little Wars Convention on huge map with bigger figures.  This game should not be played by more than 2 players.  Also in my one game the "war" part of the game was almost useless.  Search for Frodo and wear him down.  Once he gets to Mordor, just hope you corrupt him enough before he moves the whole track.

Need more plays to really see if the war is taken out of this game.

An overly long, detailed, and somewhat "risk-like" version of Lord of the Rings.  The ring-bearer is mostly disconnected from the battle stuff, the politics of rousing the west against the forces of Sauron is just a matter of time, and the combat system isn't that interesting.

It's an example of check-the-box design, where most events in the trilogy get an event card somewhere with flavor text.  That's not the same as recreating the essential tensions of the book: Can the west be roused in time?  Can Sauron be distracted from the ring-bearer's quest?

Played it about twelve times now, and love it. I don't read the strategy articles, but balance seems about perfect. Too bad I don't have more opponents...

I have played several games, and most of them have been close, although so far most of them have been won by the SP.  I am a long-time LotR fan, and really enjoy how well this game captures the theme of the books.  The only reason I didn't rate this game a 10 is due to the length of the game.

I really enjoy playing this game with its epic feel.  However, it takes a major commitment of space and time, so it doesn't get played as often as it might.

RATING: 8.5
Slightly complicated on the rules front, but after a couple of games you get the hang of it (hence -0.5).  
The multiple ways of winning are great.  The mini's are beautiful, as is the map, and the rest of the components.  Plays very nicely with 2, but not played with 4.  It seems a 2 player game tho.  A real "you can never quite do everything you want to" game.  Length can be a problem - 4 hours is about right once you both have the rules down.

Alas, must join in the chorus and sing the praises of this remarkable game. This design took imagination; and really captures mine as well. Great potential for an expansion, but it doesn't NEED one. The miniatures are amazing. Whoever sculpted the minis is the Michaelangelo of gaming minis!  :) If you're having problems w/ balance/leaning for the minis, just use hot water to straighten them and then put in refrigerator for a few minutes.

RATING: 5
I really wanted to like it and althoug it has great theme and great pieces it eventually leaves you kind of unsatisfied. The worst is that it makes you choose your strategy in the beginning and then it's practically impossible to change it. You gotta fight through with it.This is especially bad as it is a long game and you cant just start over with a 3 hour game to try a new approach.
All in all... you can play it for the theme and beauty of the game but you'd expect more. Edit: sold it with a heavy heart, but there is hardly anytime that I will play it

I have this game in my collection since 2005. Mainly because of the daunting rulebook, the daunting FAQ and a messy gameplay test in 2006 I never properly played it. Until yesterday evening, that is. It took us six hours to play, but it was a great experience. Cannot believe how incredibly faithful to the book (and film) this game is - it is really dripping with theme and full of drama, allowing for some great showdowns at key locations on the board. The only minor complaint I have after playing a single game is that some of the cards seem a bit too powerful, but that might just be a matter of experience.
Still, the game will probably sit on my shelf for another year before it hits the table again. It takes too much time to play on a regular evening, and requires a second player who is just as dedicated to playing such a complex game as me. My advice for your first game: Definitely have both players read the rules and be sure to print one of the great summaries created by BGG users.
Now, did this game not have an expansion?...

I am not usually a big fan of war games, but War of the Ring is a magnificent design. This game captures the essence of LOTR and gets a big thumbs up. The game is extremely thematic and card play clear reflects progression of the story line. I especially enjoy the hunt tiles and how it affects movement of the fellowship. The fellowship part of the game was extremely well designed and well integrated into the game play. I am less pleased with how the battles are conducted. The battles look relatively simplistic and as the free peoples, your choices are rather limited. Which brings me to my biggest worry: the replayability of this game is limited, at least I suspect. The starting armies and strategies are similar and i could imagine, or time, a dominant strategy will emerge. Still, it is a very well designed game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Only 1 play so far. This one is very difficult to rate. 

For first, it takes way too long to setup and quite too long time to play. 

The graphics and miniatures are very cool, but make the game play bit difficult and annoying from time to time 
I was playing the Mordor and failed to notice that you can directly move from the north to Minas Morgul... which cost me the game actually. The map is a bit difficult to read and manage.

Also, I'm not 100% convinced that the action dice are optimal decision limiting tool for such a long game. You can get very much screwed by the dice. For example, in our play the fellowship did not throw a single fellowship move (nor the joker action) during his 3 first turns. That's pretty bad.

However, I like many of the mechanics. I like how the fellowship works and how you get more dice etc. Mechanics go very well hand in hand with the excellent theme. I liked the feel of the game, it really feels like playing a LotR game.

There is slightly too many minor rules for my taste. Even so they work well with the great theme, they tend to slow the game and it is very difficult to keep them all in your head, when playing.

Anyway, I still want to try it again. It had lots of upsides too.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Each side has two paths to victory, and concentrating on one allows your enemy to get the upper hand in the other.  So it's self balancing without having the sides be identical.  Impressive design.  Flavorful, too.

Would be a ten but docked a point for poor human factors engineering: microscopic card text, inscrutable heraldic emblems, minis too similar and too big for their regions, map could've been better.

I've only played one game of War of the Ring, but it was a real blast. I took a military victory over the Free Peoples. However, it has been noted a thousand times that the game is largely luck dependent. Some good rolls (or bad rolls) and some really good cards (or bad cards) can really change the face of a battle, but there is a lot of tactical play required in making the right moves at the right time.

The only reason this is not a 10 for me is the playtime.

This game is extremely thematic and tons of fun to play, but the strategic options are in fact pretty limited upon repeated play. The cards and dice do add some random element to it, but only enough to modify your strategy from one to another of the available 5 or 6 viable ones.

If you play it only occasionally, this will not likely become an issue. If you play it fairly often, it could become a bit tiresome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
A great game that duly deserves its ranking. This game is dripping with theme and puts you into Tolkien's Middle-Earth while not sacrificing gameplay or strategy. The game has a ton of different mechanics in it but they work very well and come together nicely. Expect a long time on the first play. Setup is extensive, learning curve is a bit steep, and you will be consulting the rulebook often. However, it is well worth the time and investment. A beautiful game.

Played with three players for the first time. Definitely fun.

Lord of the Rings theme.  Board based wargame, adventure game.

Splendid strategy game that will please most fans of fantasy boardgame/wargame.  For Tolkien fans, this game is a must as many aspects of the books are presented here, seamlessly blending in with the general gameplay.

I usually play the free peoples, and lose most of the the time.  It is one of the few games where you enjoy the game just as much if you lose.

Just had first play (the introductory game only). I played Free Peoples and got absolutely hammered - so comprehensively despite my best efforts, that my opponent and I agreed that it seemed terribly weighted in favour of the Shadow Armies.

RATING: 9
We've been discussing this as an option for the deeper war games we don't play any more.  The minis would beg to be painted, it looks like the theme would just ooze onto the table, but we're still thinkin' about it.  The board is small, but we're not sure about the price tag for the rumored collector's edition.

Got to play this with two others who knew the game using 2-player teams instead of the 4 player rules.  Both enjoyed it but we're still thinkin'.  Main issue is whether we'd actually play it enough, Hannibal's been sitting in the cabinet a while now too.  We definitely want a bigger board, but....

The view at this time is that we're most likely going to try to snag the collector's edition.  We both want the bigger board and really don't want to spend the time this late in life to paint the minis.

This one's starting at a 9.  We'll have to wait and see how it holds up with just the two of us when our copy arrives.

Great gameplay and the best themed game I have played. Light war game style reminds me of Axis & Allies. Both sides have their challenges and rewards. Finally reaching Mount Doom and destroying the ring feels great especially if, like me, it takes you a few games to do it. Watching your unending Shadow hoards crush the free peoples armies make you feel invincible, the Ring is mine!! Until next time which is hopefully not too long but tricky as our games take 4 hours (including rules checks).

My wargame experience is pretty limited, but if I wanted to buy a 2 player wargame of this complexity, WotR would be the way to go.

Epic and brilliant.

The game is all right, but the setup and takedown times are excessive. The playing pieces should have been color coded by individual faction (instead of just us vs. them) on the Fellowshop side to help make this easier. Doesn't get played much, but it is fun to play when it does see table time.

The rulebook is just horrible and the FAQ with clarifications just as thick. Its a dice-rolling feast with alot of luck involved also with the card draws. Setting up the board and overall playtime is waay too long. Pieces and many special rules makes it a fiddly mess. It could be an entertaining game that catches LOTR like no other if it wasnt for all the special rules and hilarious time investment. Very hard to learn let alone teach to anyone.

Arguably the most cohesive and faithful treatment of a theme out there.  The Shadow player is trying desperately to find the ringbearer, but also  managing an all-out offensive.  Meanwhile, the Free Peoples player has to wisely manage his risk in moving the fellowship, while trying to apply his cards to their greatest effect.  The theme that doesn't come through in the base mechanics of the game is supplemented with the cards, which allow some wonderful uses of very specific concepts from the book without having to add special exceptions to the rules.  This game has its drawbacks as well. The rulebook is poorly organized, and figures are alarmingly difficult to distinguish, especially for the Free Peoples' forces.  Perhaps the biggest flaw, though, is how games seem to come down to the hunt tile draw in Mordor.  Drawing an eye tile in Mordor can be crippling, and drawing two is usually enough to end the game for the fellowship.  Although this heightens the drama on the last several turns, it also means the previous 2+ hours of the game were more or less irrelevant.

Ya he repetido y las impresiones siguen sin ser del todo positivas. No es mi estilo de juego, también hay que decirlo. Especialmente en el caso del jugador de las sombras, me parece un poco monótono, ya que tu objetivo es uno y sólo uno (que la compañía pierda por corrupción es algo que depende mínimamente de ti).

RATING: 7
Extremely well-done recreation of the War for Middle Earth and the Quest of the Ringbearer(s). A military strategy game joined to a hunt-and-seek quest game, War of the Ring is very well balanced. Lots of great choices present themselves to either the Free Peoples or Shadow players. So many, in fact, that players may struggle to focus on getting one thing done well.

My only negative criticism of the game is that only 2 can play. The game system doesn't suggest any clean workarounds that would give additional players any significant share in making the critical decisions (well, any decision can be made by a committee instead of a solo-player, but I'm not sure that does much more than add confusion and complication - no real value add there).

I cannot get the movie images out of my head, which is very unfortunate. But putting the fact that I am neither a Lord of the Ring nor, generally, a fantasy fan aside: Too many rules, too much fiddling with miniatures that don't fit into the territories, miniatures look far too similar (for someone who doesn't mess with spraypaint), takes a century and a half to set up. I am particularly not fond of rules like "If character A is in territory B and opponent's character C is not in play you may do XYZ in territory D except if card E has been played by opponent". It makes things very unpredictable and it's hard to develop any strategy, especially if you are the fellowship player and hence rely more on individual characters' cards. It is not entirely unenjoyable once you get into it a bit and it's got a nice board. I've been told it gets better once you know the game better - I guess I just don't like the idea of having to learn 20 cards by heart before being able to play the game properly.

RATING: 9
The definitive simulation of the actual, historical War of the Ring.  Always tense right down to the wire, with really well-designed, asymmetric victory conditions.  Excellent interaction between the military and the political.  Always tempts you to try something new - like bringing in the dwarves or making a grab for the Grey Havens.  Play it with a Lord of the Rings buff (I have one handy) for an added dimension of realism - they will tell you the real-life, actual, historical events referred to on the cards and such like.

RATING: 8
A brilliantly designed game which absolutely nails its theme. The shadow has endless hordes, while every free peoples soldier that is lost brings defeat by the hands of Sauron ever closer. The fellowship spends the game ducking and dodging the ring-wraiths that stalk them, as Frodo races against time to destroy the ring at Mount Doom. Everything about this game rings true to the Middle earth saga, which is a real credit to the design team.

It's also just dripping with plastic miniature goodness and every component is top notch. Unfortunately, there is one instance in which the designers worried more about aesthetics then functionality. The map, while providing a wonderfully detailed view of the political and cultural boundaries of Middle-Earth, is a train wreck when it comes to playing the game. The territories where most of the action takes place are far to small to hold the pieces involved, while outlying regions that never see play are huge. Another problem with the graphic design of the map is the cities, forts, and towns are all but indiscernible from one another. This can be a major annoyance, since each of these features has a different effect on battles that are conducted there, and thus it often requires constant referrals to the rulebook to determine under exactly what conditions you are actually fighting.

Another slight irritation stems from the miniatures, which are quite nice but all molded in the same color. Free peoples are blue, shadow nations are red. While I'm sure this was a production cost issue, the game requires you to track each nations participation in the War of the Ring separately. It's not too tough to differentiate between the shadow races since Orcs, Goblins and Easterlings are very easy to tell apart. The problem lies with the Free People armies, as the plastic miniatures of Rohan, Gondor and The North are almost identical in sculpt. Again, this causes extra, needless referrals to the pictures in the rulebook. Overall, it tends to unnecessarily complicate things in an already complicated game.

Nit picking aside, the asymmetrical gameplay and differing win conditions of the two sides are one of my favorite aspects of the game. It feels like each player is playing a different game, yet they intertwine flawlessly. I also enjoy the action dice mechanism. It adds quite a bit of interesting decision making to the game, although occasionally a bad roll can force you to essentially waste a turn. Still, the dice provide the perfect touch of chaos, so that you never know exactly what is going to happen on any given turn.

The end game is technically a little random, but nevertheless I enjoy the tension created as the last few tiles are drawn when Frodo makes his final approach to the Crack of Doom. A bigger concern is that the shadow side has more or less been solved. An aggressive move to the north can be very difficult for the Free People to stop, which can lead to an easy military victory for the shadow.

UPDATE: The Battles of the Third Age expansion has helped to take out some of the predictability that had started to creep into the game with repeated plays. If you already own this game, GET IT.

RATING: 8.5
A very nice game with trully stunning artwork. On the good news, it can very easily be played on a one-on-one basis (2 player game) and the game theme appeals to lots of people. Downtime can be a problem sometimes but due to the fact that the players interact in the game this can be eased a bit. Also I'd say that the learning curve for newbies can be a bit steep (there are lots of exceptions to the rules to remember). If you're a LOTR nut (like my bro) I'd reccomend it any day.

A unique and original amalgamation. Clearly inspired from the books down, not the mechanics up.  Filled with tough tradeoffs and loads of overlapping decisions. AP isn't a strict concern (there's too much to evaluate, and possibilities are too chaotic); however, there is a lot of card text to wade through, and figuring out the right order with the dice you have does take time.

The rules are a pain, though, and there are some pointless bits.

I have the Collector's Edition--see my game comment there for my lengthy profession of love for this game.

Most of my games played have been with the expansion, but the base game is also great.  Some aspects are more scripted in the base game (kill Gandalf early as FP, attack Dale-Erebor-Woodland Realm as SP), and some are more scripted with the expansion (bring the Elves to war first as FP).  Overall, both have [i]plenty[/i] of strategic diversity though, so I wouldn't worry too much about it.

My only complaint is that the original board is a usability nightmare.  Despite the board being huge, many of the regions that see the most action are way too small, borders are wonky and hard to see (especially when packed with units), and settlements and cities are not nearly obvious enough.  The collector's edition board fixes all of these problems wonderfully, and hopefully they will use this same layout in the new revised edition.

Also, download the revised collector's edition rules, which are much easier to follow and reference.

RATING: 10
I just dont know about this one.  I think fiddly and underdeveloped comes to mind.  Like, very fiddly, and I usually dont mind fiddly games... Another issue that drives me to distraction is the serious component usability issues: Map areas are too small for the huge amount of minis, and the damn Nazgul are idiotically tall and prone to being knocked over.  I found this supremely annoying, and was highly distracted dealing with the miniatures, nazgul, and the disks that one uses to represent armies.  I found the components to be so annoying, that I had a hard time liking the game at all.  This game should have counters instead of miniatures.  

I liked the action dice mechanic, I didnt find it particularily limiting.  It made doing things to get more dice mandatory though, so things can get sort of scripted, at least in that regard.  To play this game even semi-competently, it is 100% necessary to know both players decks.  Strongly suggest reading all the cards before playing, otherwise frustration will set in.  Overall, meh.

Okay, the above was my ORIGINAL REVIEW.  I still don't like the fiddlyness of the pieces, but I've revised my opinion to calling this game a 10 after playing it more.  In fact, this might be the best game I've played in the last decade.

This might go up after more playings.  During my first game, I thought I played the Free Peoples pretty well, but just got overwhelmed by a constant barrage of cards increasing my corruption.  I ultimately lost due to getting to a 12 corruption two steps from Mt. Doom.

Oops.  Turned out we played it wrong, and we were giving the Shadow too many victory points.  This made me bypass healing in Minas Tirith.  I think it would have been even closer had we played it correctly.

Played it again as the Free Peoples - everything went my way.  Got to Mt. Doom with 1 corruption.

I have played the game and find it to be very engaging and enjoyable. I rate it a very good game and it is easy to get me to play it.  I find the components to be good (could have been better. I painted the bases of all minis) and I love having a huge map of Middle Earth.  Captures the epic feel of LotR.  Very good replay value.  It is complex with a lot to remember and to do, so it may not be for the casual gamer.

What captures the feel of Tolkien's universe and condenses it into anywhere from 2 to 4 hours of nail-biting, fantastical action, where the Free Peoples hang by a thread as the armies of Sauron march across the landscape, pillaging and burning? If you said the Peter Jackson movie adaptation of the trilogy, then you'd be right! If you said War of The Ring, you'd also be right! I have yet to encounter a game wherein the universe/theme translates as well as this one does. Every game I play simply amazes me. The only problem I've ever had with this game is the totally disorganized rulebook, which can be realistically called an editor's nightmare. But if you take the time to learn WOTR from someone who knows how to play, then you will find it "goes down easy." 

If you ever see me at a Con and you WANT to learn how to play this incredible game, I'll gladly teach you.

RATING: 8.5
This is a great 2 player strategic wargame.  It's almost two types of games in one.  The good side is trying to hold back the tide of darkness while delivering the ring to Mordor and the evil side is trying to destroy the ring bearer and take over free cities.  It's a little long but the dice mechanics are cool and the epic feel of it is fantastic.  Love to bring this out any time.  The setup takes a while though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Huge game, the biggest board I've ever seen, lots of pretty minis and rules that offer enough depth for replayability, even though it always is "the same war".

My game came incomplete, I sent an email to the maker and got the missing parts a  few weeks later.  

The minis could have been colour coded, now it takes some time to learn what is what. And I think it would turn messy if you play a four player game (since there only are two coloured sets of pieces).

RATING: 7.5
Very long, and terrible ergonomics. Still a very fun game, one I hope to play a lot more of. The theme is there in spades. The game has a lot of randomness, but not quite enough to make it balance out. Still, I'll play this anytime I've got a few hours available.

"7.5" after 1st play without expansion, it may increase (playing with it).

I think the game has a bug - experienced players win military by Sauron very quickly and there is no way to prevent it.

I like mechanic of this game very much.

purchased 301204..in the process of painting...please hold..completed painting and have since managed one game (albeit a bit rushed towards the end as we were running out of time) I thought it a good game but not as intuitive as I would have thought. Keen for another try but as the frenzy of the movie trilogy has now worn off, I'm not so sure how easy it will be to get this game to the table. So, of course, it also meant I didn't get the expansion. On the other side of this, this year (2 years later in December 06, I've played 27 games of the Lord of the Ring:Confrontation by Reiner Knizia. So it's a much simpler game, but I'm pleased in the fact that I have successfully introduced this game (now as a standard) with my non gamer work-mates who previously would play god knows what, but generally had to involve killing and slaughter of other players units. I doubt I'd ever convince them to try WotR however.

Exceeded my expectations.  Former iterations of this concept have jettisoned either the personal quest or the grand strategy aspects of Tolkien's Trilogy; this incorporates both, admirably.  Shadow/Freeple balance is an issue, but easily corrected.

I am so glad I spent the hours wading through the non-indexed and poorly organized rules for what has turned out to be an amazing gaming experience that perfectly reflects what is meant by the term THEME.  This is not just a game... this IS the War of the Ring.  It reminds me of what all the other Euro games I play are missing.  A heart and soul.  A masterpiece that improves with each additional playing.

This is a beautiful and high quality game.  It is simple, plays fast, and has a high degree of player interaction which keeps all players in the game the whole time.  While it doesn't necessarily follow the books, this game manages to deliver an enjoyable narrative that could hardly be more evocative of Tolkien's world.  The game is fairly well balanced, and the expansion seems to further the balance.


-----
Added notes on the BotTA expansion to that game's page.  I would say ultimately that game balance is better without the expansion elements.  Better yet, just go with the second edition.  For posterity sake, I cannot see ever removing the "10" rating. Despite moving on to a new editions, it is still the same brilliant game.  I would consider this and 2e really a single "10" rating.

A mish mosh of fairly good (production quality) and very bad (everything else). Very strong theme, excellent looking components (which don't fit on the board, by the way, and make identifying borders and regions nigh impossible). But the complex, arduous gameplay greatly detracts from the experience. I've never felt so uninvolved, bored and disinterested in my role in a game. Decisions are not very compelling, the exception-riddled rules are confounding, and the gameplay bogs down into a herky-jerky pace that really squeezes any enjoyment out of this. I never need (or want) to suffer through this again. I was delighted to trade this away for El Grande...

Played at Origins.  First off, the look of the thing is fantastic.  Even with the pre-production copy we were playing you could sense that the final edition will just scream quality.  The pieces are FANTASTIC.  Those of you who thought that Quest for the Dragonlords was the shiznat will really get to see what good figures are.  The game itself is quite fun, and I look forward to playing it some more.  My buddy and I were evil, and we had a blast crushing the goodies.  It was a very close game.  I like the action dice as they sort of remind me of the card-driven wargames that I'm into right now.  Balancing the battle stuff against the various tracks and finding or moving the fellowship creates a nice bit of tension.  All-in-all seems like a must have.

In my oppinion it's  the most theme-based Lotr board game.

You play along the whole trilogy.

At most points the game gives you the best possibilities for a win when you play conform to the storyline but you can choose for yourself if you want to try a different path (if you play your cards right you can change history :D).

Very strategical game and very balanced between the forces of evil and good.

Best to be played with two players!

Surprisingly balanced considering how asymmetrical the two sides are.  The cards not only add tons of theme, but make the game exciting and full or surprises.  Lots of viable strategies for both sides make each game different.  The rules are a little intimidating to new players, but actually simple compared to many war games (no tables to reference and few modifiers).  Almost always a nailbiter to the end.  Only reason this is not a 10 is to let the Collector's Edition have a higher rating.

2J - The best game I have about The Lord of the Rings. Every play is an adventure.

RATING: 9
This game is Lord of the Rings in a box. Period.

RATING: 6
PROS: Thematically accurate to the books, great strategy game, lots of figures (both a PRO and CON)

CONS: TERRIBLE rule book. Too much writing for very simple system (though does cover everything). Ignorable Quick-start rules, need play a few games before everything becomes understood. Map/board poorly designed, favoring accurate middle-earth map scale instead of an evenly distributed war-game board. Locations are hard to find, borders hard to locate, painting NEEDED on some models to help identify factions

RATING: 6.5
I got to play it a few weeks after I played Middle earth quest, which is the main reason I could not give it a 7 or higher. 
It's an OK game, but when compared to MEQ, it fairs a little in every category.

Best two player game.  Looks wonderful and is fun to play.  Great Theme and true to the books.  Amazingly well done.

After 1 Play: I have the same problems with this as I do with many wargames.  First, I don't like the number of rules in these types of games.  They don't fit together in a logical system, and as such I find them very hard to remember.  Second, my tolerance for luck diminishes quickly as game length increases, and this simply has too much of it.

It's very complete. All the aspect of the story of Lords of the rings are perfectly recreated.
I think that it's too long to play but remain really a good game

RATING: 8
Long game, particularly long setup time, needs a table as big as the universe, miniature colors are bad bad bad, the rules are confusing... Who cares? No game I've ever played has conveyed theme so well before.

Perfect adaption of the book - playing the free people makes you feel so desperate with Sauron storming from all over! I love the way the games handles the assymmetrie and still feels pretty balanced. Only drawback are the bad rules (especiall the german ones) - you can't play without a FAQ...

Only one playing, but a good game indeed! Hard to say if it has lasting power, but that I will see.

Dripping with theme, and an interesting strategic situation. Not as much maneuvering as I'd maybe hoped (it's more of an efficiency game). It can be played in 2 hours, and feels satisfying.

1/22/09 -- A valiant effort, but it's hard to like a game that totally misinterprets its own inspiration.  The LOTR novels were so not about warfare, or its logistics, which is all this game seems to offer.  The entire drama of the Fellowship's adventures are relegated to an uninspired side track and the game is instead about how many orcs Sauruman can muster before the Ents turn up and other such trivialities.  I honestly feel like WotR is for the gaming equivalent of people who think Vivien Leigh should flash her tits in "Gone with the Wind", which is to say that it's for people who don't get it.

I also don't like the action dice.  I think their intent was to add a sense of uncertainty along the lines of the cards in a CDG, but it doesn't work.  The dice seem to mainly serve your opponents by letting them know what they can safely get away with each turn.  They were an interesting experiment, but I suppose the fact that we haven't seen them reused in other games since proves my point.

Still, it's hard not to like the game to some degree.  It is based on the LOTR saga after all, and events of the War of the Ring are interesting to see played out.  It's also not terribly long and it has flashy pieces.  I'll stand by a 7 rating for the time being.

I PLAYED IT (4 times so far). You need one game to get comfortable with the rules, but then it becomes a wonderful gaming experience, and you can set up and play the game in 3-4 hours. Important choices to be taken, tactics, atmosphere backed up with the best production ever - excellent miniatures AND extensive playtesting. I can still give this game +/- 1 point, but is currently my favourite.

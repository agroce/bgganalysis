Good, classic Knizia feel.  Pretty simple game with some connection/enclosure stuff slightly reminiscent of [b]Genial Spezial[/b]...and other games.  Glad to have another bidding game from RK after so long.  The bidding itself is nothing spectacular, but it all plays pretty smoothly.  Hope he keeps this up!

Not bad; certainly not good, either. Pretty game, though, thanks to Herr Vohwinkel.

I think there is a reasonable game here.  The auction mechanism is a twist on Traumfabrik's closed economy, with players who bid nothing sharing the pool of previously spent shells (Orongo's currency).  There is also a spatial element, with players seeking to extend networks to cover as much of Easter Island as possible.  While Orongo offers some thematic nods to the history, it is all pretty abstracted in Knizia's signature style. For me the game's fundamental problem is that the outcome of any single auction rarely seems critical. Outbid to claim three spaces?  Well, claim two instead and spend no shells. As a consequence the game play felt flat and undramatic.

I was quite shocked that Orongo's art came from the celebrated Franz Vohwinkel and a publisher of Ravensburger's stature.  Not only is it ugly, the tiles blend into the exact same coloured board spaces to make it much more difficult than it should be to see where everything is.  The conch shells look good, but do have a tendency to roll around.

I thought this was just okay. Feels like several other games with a pasted on theme. In this case, the theme is molded in plastic in the form of shells that roll around the board. Very impractical for their use in marking exhausted hexes. The tile placement to indicate which hexes are active seemed odd to me.

The game mechanisms are better than the average ratings indicate. This is a true Knizia, and one that a Knizia fan would definitely enjoy and appreciate. Released ten years ago, it'd probably be a hit.

Of course, games don't get worse as they get older. If a game would be considered great ten years ago, it's still a really great game. It's just, how do you get people to look at this game? No KS hype/buzz, no plastic minis, no "wicked cool" theme involving spaceships or orcs. Yawn.

I think half the people who rate this poorly are in this camp. The other half are those who get frustrated with the components, which is fair. The shells work great as currency but are annoying to place on the board -- easily to roll off and jostle others. Moreover, the spaces [i]with[/i] tiles don't look very different from the spaces [i]without[/i] tiles, which is less forgivable. We usually play three players and mark the tiles with the fourth player's markers, which is okay. Still, a notably bad misstep.

As for the way it plays, though -- good solid Knizia, absolutely no complaints.

2-player has strategic positional play with blocking on the hex map, but the auctions are uninteresting. Multiplayer has too much chaos on the map, so you can only hope to claim spots on the map with immediate gains.

Players bid shells to earn the right to claim locations on Rapa Nui, which triggers the opportunity to build Moai statues.  Intriguing new Knizia game, combining auction, position placement, but is ultimately a race game (bit like Blue Moon City, but without the temporary alliances).  Once again we get a very well  designed and developed game, honed down to a 45 minute play time, and is remarkably tense.  Anyone who claims the theme is absent needs to read some more, and look harder.  I'm hardly an Easter Island expert, but even I could spot several well implemented thematic touches.  

Good stuff - sits well amongst any of the 45 minute Knizia super-fillers of the past 20 years.

I don't need to own Orongo but happy to play. It's easy to learn and wrapped up in 45 minutes or so. It's got randomness/luck built in with the tile draw which goes to making a new game every time but there's not necessarily a way to get "good" at the game. Still, it plays so quickly that I don't mind. Plus the auctions and the route building make for a lot of interaction. The route building, in particular, can make for a very mean game. Which I like!

Blind bidding game. Each player must build all of his statues, and in order to do this, needs to take control of several –connected- fields on a map. The available fields increase during the game, as they are drawn randomly. How many fields a player gets is determined each round by a simultaneous action.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pleasant and quick. What keeps it from being a top-tier Knizia auction game is that while it has some tempo (in the form of its closed economy), there's no real sense of player asset differentiation--usually everyone is equally interested in winning the bid most of the time.
I mean, a weak Knizia auction game is still great.

I might have rated this a 6 or 6.5, but the components really, really suck. The plastic chips can be seen through, but just barely. The shells (snails, actually) keep sliding off the chips and rolling over when you place them, and the Moai make for nice Dominoes-like chain reactions. What fiddly materials - although they do look somewhat attractive. Oh, and the tiles are hard to see, especially at the beginning of the game. 
Almost needless to say nowadays, there isn't the slightest hint of thematic depth to be found. The game could take place anywhere and doesn't take into account anything meaningful about Easter Island. As for gameplay, yes, it's fine about once, but I don't have any desire to play again, as the game offers nothing new.

After six plays, I really like this game. I'm not usually a fan of blind bidding, but I like how it's implemented here. The game this reminds me most of is [thing=904]Traumfabrik/Dream Factory[/thing], since the money that players bid ends up in the hands of other players, in a closed economy. A significant difference is that money leaves the game as players pay for moai -- and in this respect the theme (of the decline/collapse of Easter Island) is sort of baked into the mechanics, in the fashion of Knizia at his best.

I am partial to the theme, and I love the shells and wooden moai bits. That the shells can roll doesn't bother me too much, but the tiles are way too hard to see on the board (the tiles look exactly like the board space underneath them, making it hard to see at a glance which tiles have come out so far). This bugged me enough that I've put a little red dot sticker in the lower right of each of the tiles in my copy.

After a long pause RK has been able make a game around an interesting auction mechanism. Besides that there's also a tile laying mechanism and combining these two makes it interesting. The weak point is the random way the tiles come onto the board which causes some players to benefit in the end, because they've been building their networks in the right area. The neat shells are not that practical.

Beautiful game, beautiful components – that can be a bit of a pain to use. Shells roll on the plastic tokens, and tiles drawn and placed on the board are just not distinct enough (they should be more different than the illustrations they are placed onto). Otherwise, it’s a family game (luck does play a role and it’s very simple) and should be treated as such. It’s not much for gamers (probably most would say meh), but as a family game I believe it works fine and I’m really impressed by the fact that this big box Knizia is not a rehash of his old mechanism ideas. And my wife who is really a family gamer liked it too, even though she hates bidding – but bidding works fine here, even when playing two-player.

Update: I'm starting to think it's like classic Knizias - the more I play the higher I am rating this one. The rule that you have to place shells on the tiles used make the end of the game very tight and fun.

Update (4 plays) - and it's even better now that I fixed one minor rule error.

Dr. Knizia's star certainly has fallen. There was a time when everything he touched was hailed as a cause for celebration, but now you have things like this not even budging the needle. I think there's certainly an audience for this sort of game now, but I don't know that it's me. It's the kind of mechanics-first design like Through the Desert or Samurai that Knizia built his reputation on, and in 2004 or so it might have made some waves. But I think the general audience has moved on to convoluted VP engines and I personally want more narrative, thematic games. If you like more straightforward, pre-Agricola designs, it's worth trying this one out.

My favorite game from Essen 2014.
It feels like 90s German style game.

I already played this game 30 times. Sometimes, 3-4 games in a row. It is truly excellent mixture of auction-bidding and area-conquering (How many games have both?).

More I play the game, I see more different ways to win. Most player think this is very short gamer's game.

Ok. Components have problems. But the game surpass these problems as it is not unplayable.

I like the secret bidding (same as in Modern Art). The shells are a cute component, but sadly don't sit well on the board/tokens since they have no flat side. The cheap bingo chips work to mark player areas, but make it difficult to see though depending on the colour. An OK bidding game.

A good game spoiled by bad design choices. The shells roll about and fall off the tiles they were placed on and should have been flat. The blue and green translucent discs look similar. And the tiles are the same colour as the board so are hard to differentiate when placed. A player tried to resolve this problem by placing the tiles off shore which just made mapping routes even harder for me. Not sure I would bother playing again because of these issues.

Reiner Knizia with some cool bits. Too bad the bits are unhelpful and obnoxious to use in game play. It is a cool bidding game to try and make paths and connections to place the faces down on the island. It was interesting and not the worst game I have ever played. I would play again, maybe since I won. It is not high on the list of games I would want to play again, however.

A recent Knizia that feels like an old Knizia. It's pretty good -- a closed-economy auction combined with route-building and blocking. The abstracted Easter Island theme is typically Knizia too. Unfortunately, the production is poor. Tiles that should stand out from the board don't and the bidding markers are cute but impractical shells that roll around.

A new Knizia hearkening back to his classic era.  Minimal rules with plenty of play - I think they used to call that elegance back in the day.  I am somewhat stunned how under the radar this great little game is flying.  Four players new to the game - all loved it.  Seems very family friendly.

An abstract with a fun blind bidding system, where only the winner pays, but 2nd place still gets a benefit over 3rd and 4th bids. If you bid 0, you instead collect the accumulated payments (but you divide it up if more than 1 player bid 0, which sucks for them). It's probably best to try to consistently come in 2nd for a while.   

I prefer the bidding system in another Knizia game, Dream Factory, where the losers divide up the winning bid automatically every round and where the theme is much more interesting.  Connecting meaningless tiles on a board to purchase a Moai is as pasted on a theme as you can get.

Orongo is a classic sort of Knizian design – basic in rules, but with a twist or two to give it considerable depth. Sometimes you'd want to win the blind auction, other times you'd prefer second place, and there are times you'd just not want to bid at all. The closed economy also shrinks gradually, and helps tighten the race considerably towards the end.

Players are bidding to build networks on the board, and there are some simple blocking tactics which can be executed. Network-building is an otherwise hit-or-miss mechanism for me, and unfortunately it's too dry for my tastes here. Poor component design further adds to the frustration – the shells wobble about when placed, and the tiles lack contrast to differentiate them from the board. It's a quick and solid auction game, but falls short in the charm factor.

Production is not up to usual Ravensberger standards. Think i will enjoy this with 3 or 4. V simple auction for areas, make connections and race to finish

Much better with 4 than 2. Lots of blocking. And tension in the auction as the currency in circulation diminishes as the game progresses.

However production issues do make this difficult to play and evaluate other players board positions

Yes, this is a Reiner game through and through. Simple rules, good strategic and tactical options, very, very streamlined, short playing time... and no soul at all. It's been developed to the max and that leaves no room for a soul. There simply is no spark at all and that's a shame. I'm sure he still is able to make great games but for some reason he seems content to simply design these family and kids games that have little to no appeal for gamers. Too bad, he did some awesome stuff back in the day.

There's a lot to like here: the blind bidding/money management, the reducing economy, the ability to play nicely or try and actively block each other off and the simple accessible rules.

Unfortunately this is all let down by some very poor (or at least misguided) production choices with the shells not being fit for purpose, the colours all being quite similar (though we were fine with it in a pub basement), the placing of new tiles each round not always helping to identify what spaces were available and the likelihood of knocking over a moai and it causing a ripple effect that made a mess of the board. We came up with better options for most of the above in about 30 seconds of post-game chatting.

Ultimately Orongo was an interesting game that I'd like to play more, but Ravensburger have not done it justice. I also don't know how many plays it has in it without a variable set up (something like in Hawaii would have been perfect here).

RATING: 7
This is a tentative 7 for Knizia. It won't rise but may fall to a lower rating. I like this game but it comes with a few pitfalls which won't be clear until we play a few more games. There are many classic Knizia hallmarks to the game. A blind bidding, closed auction mechanism. In fact, more than being a closed economy, it is a shrinking one as shells are spent to mark used resources on the main board. So the amount of currency is essentially depleted toward the end of the game. This twist makes it a different system of resource management than Traumfabrik. 
Things I like about the game: Low rules overhead, which should not be a huge surprise for Knizia-fans; unique shrinking economy bidding system; fast game play and a very clean and streamlined end game scenario.
Things I don't like about the game aesthetics of the game not withstanding: Tiebreak situations for bidding and potential kingmaking. The last of which, I consider a potential downer. 

The game rests on bidding for the rights to claim territories on the board either for harvesting resources or for erecting Moai. So getting what you want when you want is crucial. The game is easy to understand and turns are rapid. As the board gets congested, the game becomes more and more cutthroat as players are able to cut off potential connections to the coast line which is critical for erecting Moais. This aggression could be a turn off for some and it is not hard to see someone playing spoiler by going around the board simply cutting off other players. This will be particularly galling if done on purpose when someone no longer feels he/she can win. Thus far, this has not occurred as players still feel vested in their actions. Any token spent cutting off other players is resource wasting on your own. So, the decision to play spoiler is a heavy one. It can end up something along the lines of Attika where the responsibility of cutting off an opponent lies on the player just before the winning player. Thus far, this hasn't happened, but the potential is clearly there.

Which speaks to the situation about a clean and clear ending to games. I love that games have clear and easy victory conditions that does not hinge on scoring 6 different categories, especially with hidden agendas. Orongo is simple that way: place the final ceremonial Moai and you win. However, I wonder if these games lend themselves to the situation of blocking and kingmaking. Knowing who is in the lead forces others to be a kingmaker.

Despite the game being very mathy and abstract (despite the cool Moais and shells), this game has some definite appeal.  A Traumfabrik style closed economy (although shrinking in this case) plus an interesting route building element leads to an interesting and fun experience.

BUT, as I am sure is noted elsewhere, the board coloring is horrible.  The tiles should have been a different color (brown, red, something other than green) so people could find the darn things on the board.  The production problems definitely spoil the game (thank you to the owner of the game I played for marking his tiles so we could actually see them).

A aesthetically stunning game, i am absolutely in love with the completed board (an aspect of the game that i usually don't care about).
The game itself is quite simple, fast, very very equilibrated and tense, a race to the construction of the final moai.
There are problems, yes, as many noted already: the tiles are impossible to see on the board and the gorgeous shells do tend to roll around. Still, you have to try this game as it is very nice and one of the most thematic Knizia games ever: extremely facinating if you know a bit about the history of Easter Island.

Fun closed auction with tile placement element and diminishing ecomony.

Game components are not well-thought out, leading to a rather unsavory play experience. The setup for each round is also somewhat tacky and fiddly, adding to that feeling. The main game mechanic is easy to understand and teach. Player interaction is high.

Fun game with some component issues (pieces that won't stay in position, hard to distinguish board) that negatively impact gameplay a little. Very much a case of form over function. Still, the closed economy bidding makes for some interesting choices and a tight race to the finish.

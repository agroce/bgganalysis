Fun little dice game that passes the 'Mother-in-law Test'.  The dice are a good size in your hand, too, so rolling just feels good.

What a blast! This challenging and quick game takes a few minutes to internalize, and then becomes second nature. Interest use of dice probability creates great momentum;  at the beginning of the game, you have a constant pressure to advance toward the middle, and at the end, you’re desperately hoping to get just the right roll, but other players have a chance to catch up. No perfect strategy, yet luck doesn’t seem to play a huge factor in most games.

Really great quick filler. I like that I can play it in the car, or out camping, just about anywhere. It's mindless and fun like solitaire. I can even play it modified by myself, and I don't play a lot of solo.

Great dice game for families looking for something light. Very little strategy, but enough to make a roll-the-dice-and-mark-a-score game more interesting than, say, Yahtzee.

Great little lunch time sort of game.  Definitely a good game to introduce newbies too.  This one will be a roll and write classic.  Highly recommend picking up the Deluxe version for the erasable marker and boards.

If a child wanted to play this I would.  It is a dice game with the biggest thing in its favor, is shortness.  For a quick filler game there are better choices.

Like the original just with bigger dice! And the new Qwixx Mixx side of the board is neat, adds something different without increasing difficulty of learning or playing.

Our kids (7yo and 9yo) love it. It's a quick game to play and fun to play with younger kids. I would definitely choose this over Yahtzee any day of the week.

I definately like Qwixx Deluxe better than orginal Qwixx. I find that the game usually lasts a bit longer and it seems harder to lockout the two rolls needed to end the game.  I would play this version over the original version any time.

RATING: 7.5
This is just one of those games that everybody kinda likes and nobody hates. Which pretty much makes it the perfect filler, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. This version is great with the dry erase boards and the odd variant on the other side. It's allowed me to use the original, with its dwindling supply of score sheets, as a travel version only.

(This game is one that is seriously being affected by its Geek Score. The Avg Score is currently a 7.2 with more than 80% of all votes falling in the 6-9 range. Yet it's been adjusted down to a 5.861? That's just weird. Yes, it's not as popular as many other games ranked similarly, but shouldn't that be reflected in something other than an altered score? Like maybe its standing amongst all other 7.2 games? Just sayin'.)

This is the bigger version, with eight large dry erase boards. And the backside has the Qwixx gemixxt alternate mixed board style for more variety in play.

Abstract dice rolling game.  You roll two white and 4 colored dice that are red, green, yellow and blue.  You have a board that you can select from numbers that are ascending or descending from 2 to 12 or 12 to 2.  Any player can cross off the white number on their boards.  The active player can then choose one of the white dice and a colored dice and cross off a number on that track.  The trick is that you can never cross off a number on that track to the left of the current number.  If you choose not to cross off or cannot cross off a number you take a penalty point.  

Games ends when two dice are locked or someone has taken 4 penalty points.  

The game is pretty fun.  It reminds me of Take It Easy as it is effectively a solitaire game.  Good but not a great game.  I can easily see why this was a Spiel Des Jahres nominee.

[u]29-Oct-2017[/u]:  Qwixx is a family-friendly roll and write game.  Each turn one player rolls all of the dice.  Every player can use the two white dice if they wish.  Only the current player can use the colored dice.  The goal is to score points by checking of numbers on four rows based on the two-dice totals that were rolled that turn.  The catch is that you can only cross off numbers from left right.  Once a number is crossed off, you cannot cross off anything to its left.  So there is a mix of planning, luck, and statistics.  Just don't play it with more than four or so.  The downtime can be too much if you do.

I love this game.  It is similar to Qwinto.  A quick, light weight, addictive filler game that has no down time because players can take advantage of the opponents' dice rolls for their own scoring.

I didn't see a need for them to move this into so much larger of a box. I do like the dry erase boards with the alternate board on the back (and more challenging). I will likely laminate my regular Qwixx paper with a printout of the alternate board as well. May not be room for 5 (or 8) dry erase markers, but I don't always play with that many and can share them as needed. The new board side can be very confusing for people, but adds complexity and more strategy for people familiar with the base game.

Love the huge dice and the big dry erase boards.  This version has enough boards and dry erase markers to play up to 8 people. 
Played the Qwixx Mixx side numerous times now and it changes the game much more than I thought and it's now our preferred way to play.

Erasable boards and chunky dice make the deluxe edition worth it. Just wish all the back/Mixx sides were different.

I have gotten a lot of play out of this one. It's hard to play this game just once. Almost always people want to play it again (and often again and again). I like that this one plays 8. Not perhaps at its best at 8 players, but it works okay.

Really helped my daughter learn to quickly add small numbers and to figure out the number on the dice without counting the dots each time. She started playing this when she was 5, so I'd say you can figure this game out pretty young.

The dry erase pens that came with the game were awful, so we bought a pack of expo markers, which fit in the box perfectly. The bigger dice are great for people with bad eye sight like my whole family, yet bulky for small hands to roll.

Qwixx Mix was a fun change of pace, but a little confusing at first. The rules mostly just reference the regular rules, so we couldn't figure out if locking the line meant closing that row or closing that color. We figured out that it would obviously be the color since you remove that color die from play.

This is literally the same game as Qwixx just with some markers and erasable boards. I didn't much care for the non-deluxe version of this game, but at least it's mercifully short.

The problem with Qwixx is that even if you're playing the game correctly the winner will be randomly determined by the luck of the dice. Playing well just gets you a lottery ticket and then you hope your numbers are called. There are many better and more interesting fillers that I'd rather play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Qwixx is fast, slightly mindless game of optimization and risk-taking. Yes, there are some decisions to be made, but really, you are just figuring out how fast you want to end the game and score points. You can certainly look at other player boards before deciding but that truly takes too much work for such a short filler. So you focus on your own board while trying to avoid penalties. It's just another ok filler.

Bought 11/19/16 as a Christmas present. Was able to get it for $7 which I thought was a steal since it has the dry-erase boards and markers.  I was all set to get the regular one and just laminate a few score sheets. This is much better. I have never played before. It looks fun and challenging. Looking forward to trying it out.

One of my favorite fillers of all time.

The original is frequently suggested and rarely turned down, so our scoresheet supply is nearly exhausted.  Time for a decision: order new ones, print out a stack, or purchase another copy of Qwixx just for the sheets.  Since the Deluxe version was on sale for only $10, I took that road instead.

First-world decisions are hard.

Great for non-gamers. Simple rules that are easy to teach family of nearly all ages. Components are very nice, but buy better markers. Some in my box were already dried out but the erasers worked great. There's some thought involved as to when to start crossing off numbers in a row, but otherwise roll the large chunky dice and hope the numbers you need show up.

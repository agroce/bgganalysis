Edit: I just picked up my Kickstarter copy from 5th Street Games at SaltCon 2013. The English-language version turned out beautifully, and I love the four new bonus animals: Horse, Goat, Llama, and Hippo. What a delight!

--

A gift from nadgamgee! :) 

I shared My Happy Farm at SaltCon 2012 and it went over *extremely* well. We all laughed at the hilarious artwork and each of us made sure to make our animals happy! (I don't think I've ever cared so much about the characters in a game before!) 

In a world filled with waaaaay too many dry Eurogames with pasted on themes, My Happy Farm is welcome relief. It combines charm with tightly integrated theme and mechanics in service of a very satisfying game. It belongs in everybody's game collection--and it's an excellent gateway game for new gamers.

And in what other game can you compete for the longest sheep, cow, rabbit, or pig? Love it.

Geared toward newcomers and for family members who may not be hard-core gamers. It's a simple resource conversion game with a delightful theme. You're converting seeds into food. You then either feed the food to your livestock or sell the food to buy more seeds. The player with the best-fed livestock wins.

It's a cute, basic farming game.  I have only played with four players, where it suffers from the same problem 6-player Alhambra does: the cards don't stay out long enough for you to plan ahead for anything, so it just becomes the luck of the draw for whether or not you can buy something on your turn.  I imagine that the game is much more balanced with two players.  Alternate game title: Farm Centipede.

Played this with Phil (5th Street) at a game design get-together.  Impossibly cute.  Really, it's adorable.  My girlfriend is going to love it.  And it was a surprisingly strong and tight design.  Feels similar to something like Zooloretto, which puts it in very good company.  I'll be very happy to play it again.

Quirky little game. Something is missing though. The game feels too short, yet drags a teeny bit in some places. Almost like you need to be able to "ramp up" production during the later game. Fun game, but your abilities in the first turn, are identical to what you can do in the last turn.

Fun, light, casual family game. Your goal is to have the happiest farm animals - as in the longest sausage-looking cow, pig, sheep, or bunny - all wrapped in charming cartoony artwork. A stripped-down version of "Hay Day" with a "Lost Cities" inspired scoring system.

RATING: 3
This is an odd game. It has some design issues if we are to consider it seriously. The value (in VP) of each veg is lower for higher VP cards. So, cheap cards gives you better VP payout per veg *and* they help you score the longest animal. The few cards that cost only a single veg to buy are clearly the best cards in the deck if they happen to flip up while you're doing that action you randomly get a windfall.

But maybe this game is just a fun kids game which we shouldn't think about too much. However, if that's the case I question the complexity of the game. It is a bit too complex for kids to figure out on their own. It has several moving parts. A choice each turn of 2 out of 6 actions (which must be different from each other). Hand limits and barn limits to enforce. Plant 3 of the same or 2 different veg for an action. Buy up to 3 cards, one at a time refilling the display in between. It seems like a lot of little rules for little ones to remember.

So who is this game for? I have no idea, but I know it isn't me ;)

Light, simple, and short game of acquiring seeds so that they can be planted, grown, harvested, and then used either to raise money or feed your animals.  Decide your strategy carefully because you want to make sure all your animals are the happiest of all.  Winning isn't reward, it's seeing all the faces on your happy animals.

Graphic arts are superb are but not much is happening for 2p in turns of gameplay. It ends almost when you starts to get something going. Not sure if prolonging the game would help it either since you are doing the same thing over and over again. Probably it will help to have 3-4p.

More of a kids game. I love the theme, and it is one I typically favor. There's just something about a farm that gets me, probably having worked on one for years. Still, the mechanics are pretty bad here and very card dependent. Would only play with younger ones.

Great family Euro game that kids and adults can enjoy.  For me personally  I wish it had a little more depth to keep me engaged but as a Family  game that is competitive without direct conflict, and teaches forward planning and efficiency,  it is great.  In terms of player count, 2 player feels sub-optimal but at 4 player the game really shines and is the most fun.

My Happy Farm is a quick light game with a surprising amount of strategy. To be most efficient you have to plan out your moves, while keeping an eye on everyone else. My 6 yr old played and enjoyed this thanks to a clear round structure. Not great with two players but a game I'd happily play!

Not as good as I thought it was going to be.  Kinda slow.  I like the strategy of making sure you have the plants you need when.  Kids didn't like it at all.  Probably wont stay long.  Wish there were more body parts to add.

The game is obtained to prepare children (7 and 9 years) for eurogame mechanics:
- phases 
- action choices 
- resources gathering
- planning.
We are using home rule to modify balance:
children gets some extra coins on start.
With 3 players the game is quite competitive in acquiring feed cards.

I had played this game on the second ukrainian board game festival
(	http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/70818/second-ukrainian...)

I was just a prototype, but it impressed me from idea to design. An artistic implementation of farm life, where you have to grow some forage plants to feed four animals in your farm.

Depends on what you grow, you can feed specific animal. The growing animal goes to be bigger and bigger depends on how many times you feed it.

Simple plantages' growing and animals' feeding processes via card mechanic has small barrier of undestanding of rules and allows to have a lot of fun playing this game.

I expect, this game can get very popular.

My girls really like this game quite a bit (and so do I).  Good decision making game for kids.  Requires no reading so even my 5 year old can play (and play and play; she likes this game a lot!).  She wants to make all her animals happy by feeding them (her main objective) while my eleven year old and I can try to grow the longest animals. Cute art. Cute theme. A winner!
Lots of fun for all!
Ranked 8 because my kids like it so much.

RATING: 5
My first impression was the game was too simple for adults and too complex for kids.  But by the end of the first game, it seemed better on both fronts.  The art is very childish looking, but there are some interesting, if light, tradeoffs to make between temp, efficiency, and tactical relevance.  The game is short, so there isn't time to do the most efficient process (and storage capacity limits that anyway), so it is meaningful to actually aim for a short term goal and think about other players are aiming for.

update:  the real issue with the game is that the dominant pressure is to feed each animal once with the cheapest food available.  But the gimmick is that feeding one animal many times produces a ridiculously long creature.  Having the thematic pressure and strategic pressure so starkly at odds ruins both.  The game would probably be better if unfed animals had +1's on them, thereby explicitly encouraging specialization.

1 play, 2er

This is a family game? It's got great artwork (couldn't they have had 4 different barns?), but it seems a little too thinky for a family game. Because of the hand/barn limits, and the somewhat limited harvesting, you have to time your card play just right in order to efficiently buy seeds, plant them, harvest them, and feed the animals -- without wasting time or cards. The game is good, but just a bit more complex than I'd expected going in for something billed as a family game.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Each player starts with a player board, 4 animals made of 2 cards (head and tail; head on -5 side, tail on 0 side) and 2 coins. Shuffle the deck of seed cards, give each player 2, and place 6 in a face up display. Shuffle the feed deck and put 6 of those on display face up.

On your turn:
1. advance any previously planted seeds one season (spring -> summer -> autumn -> discard pile)
2. take 2 different actions:
- buy 1-3 seed cards (1 coin each; from face up display; replenish immediately after each card taken; hand limit = 6)
- plant seeds (1 or 2, or 3-of-a-kind; from hand to spring slot)
- harvest plants (carrots and clover from summer or autumn slots; hay and beets only from autumn; cards go to barn; barn limit = 6 ... discard any excess)
- sell plants (from barn -> discard; collect 1-5 coins, as pictured on the card)
- feed animals (spend food from barn -> discard, according to combination on feed cards; add cards to appropriate animal, flipping head to 0 side if first time fed; replace card in display immediately; may feed as many times as possible)
- take 1 coin from bank

The final round triggers when you cannot replenish the feed card display. Every OTHER player gets a final turn. Then, for each animal type, the SOLE player with the longest animal (most cards) flips the tail card to the bonus +3 side. Add point values showing on all cards; highest sum wins (tiebreaker = most fed animals).

Farming euro card game for kids. Raise pigs, rabbits, cows and sheep by feeding them from the crops you grow, selling the rest to market. Silly and playful how the livestock cards convey their happiness and size by flipping the head card and adding middle girth card sections to earn points for the longest animals and lose points for the neglected. I also like the three growing seasons that convey different crops take longer to grow before harvest (e.g. Carrots ready in summer versus grains in the fall crop). The trick is to anticipate the feeding needs of the livestock cards with the time to grow and harvest your crops and managing your hand of crop cards to cover the shortages.

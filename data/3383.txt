RATING: 9
The game is as plain as a game can be, true. And it is all luck, barely any strategy. But I just can't help it, I always have a blast playing this game. 
Riding piggy back on the opponent adds a wonderful note to the game, just enough meanness to make it more interesting. 
I would play it as an opener to get the mood up. It is quick, easy and pure fun.

Yuck, random dice-fest that the strategy is very very obvious. There is a push your luck element, hmm, roll 1 die for a sure move, 2 with more risk or 3 and hope. But really that's it ... dull, totally pasted on theme.

Overall for a dice filler Can't Stop beats this in every department.

What a snorefest. When you roll dice, you may not roll higher than 7 in order to move. You roll the dice one by one and every time you get to decide to roll again or move the amount of pips multiplied by the amount of dice. Anndd thats about all you do, the whole game. Going in rounds, every time you cross the finish line you score a card. We played with 4 and there were a loooot of cards. Maybe it's slightly better with more players (some interaction with stacking the pawns), bu personally I wouldnt bother.

I'm writing this comment several years after having played the game, and to be honest I have completely forgotten the experience by now. It was a game played in between 'serious stuff', that much I do remember. A comment on the actual play informs me that the game contains 'silly dice tactics, and is therefore great for families with children'. Well, okay then. Reading through the rules I can already see the makings of Die Rüsselbande, which I think is by far the more attractive game for all involved. Rating is provisionary, but I don't expect it to change upon replaying, really.

A light and fun game that is a good filler for a games night. Start to explain the game and people think its like a game of Goose (so not interesting at all) but with the race around the table where people jump on each other necks it does become fun. People start to laugh and once they see the benefit of hiking along on someone's back they start to play the game in a really mean way.

Mahe is a super cute game! I've played with a max number of players (adults) and we had a good time! We always tried rolling exactly 7 or trying to get on other players backs. It's really easy, so it's a great game for kids as well! Definitely not a game for you if you want intense, deep-thinking action.

A smart Camel Cup style system, but this time you're aren't betting on public camels, but trying to move your own turtle to hatch eggs. Push your luck roll and move system is simple yet quite smart and backpacking is nasty and brings a bit of a tactical dimension to the dice decisions.

Roll and move race game with a twist: the players can throw the dice up to three times as long as the added values of the throws don't go beyond seven, and then move that sum multiplied by the amount of throws made on a circular track (the maximum throw equals one lap). At the "end" of a lap there's a random token with points waiting for the first player to snatch it (there's a total of 18 tokens with different values). When the tokens run out the biggest scorer wins.

Overall it's quick, luck-driven, mindless fun. Some spice is added by a quirky stacking mechanic: if one player tops another one, then it'll be the top player's choice how many throws the bottom player will attempt, and of course any token reached in that move will belong to the top player.

Simple roll and move game with enough twists (push your luck, piggyback positioning) to move it into great 15min opener territory for 4-6 people, enjoyed by gamers and family alike. We've started using a home-grown variant where, if you're on the board, you can roll two dice upfront and modify your position +/-2 if you don't crash (useful if there are potential piggyback options out there on the uneven spaces) or you can roll all three dice to move double the spaces you roll ... if you don't crash. It introduces the possibility of dramatic big come from behind wins ... and more laughs.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Sounds like a tense push your luck dice game, in which you decide to roll one, two or three dice but don't want to roll higher than 7 or forfeit your turn. But the fact you have to multiply the pips rolled if you don't bust seems to take the fun out of it, as does the summing up at game end of the chips you have taken. 
So the initial interest has waned for as far as push your luck dice games go, Exxtra seems the best so far, which I have since sold (and repurchased...and sold again).

It reminds me a lot of Parchesi; however I definitely prefer this one to Parcheesi, because 

- plays have a fixed length (until all dishes have been collected),
- at each dice throw you have a risk challenge to throw a second or third one,
- there is an extra twist especially with several players, as stones can jump on top of other ones and thus be carried along,
- it takes little space, funny illustrations, and up to 6 players.

A cute push-your-luck dice-rolling game. You roll 1-3 d6 moving your token around in a circle, collecting 1 VP chip (shuffled in random order, different values) when you pass  one position on the circle, or 2 VP chips if you land on it. The twists:
- you choose how many dice to roll
- if you roll 2 or 3 d6, your roll is doubled or tripled, respectively. But if the sum is >7, you instead jump back to the start space (do not pass go, do not collect a VP chip)!
- However, if someone has landed on top of you, when it's your turn to move the person on top of the stack tells you how many dice to roll. You must then move your token as well as everyone else sitting on top of you!

Fun, light, fast game.

Roll & move. A simple how-many-dice decision each turn (mostly a no-brainer). Played twice: once with the original roll one die, choose to roll a second rule, and once where we decided 1/2/3 dice before rolling any. The latter felt less luck-based, like more of a decision and speeded up the game.

At first I thought it was great. But then I realised nobody had ever really won a game. And then I realised we had never played by the rules. And then I realised I wanted War of the Ring. And then I realised that that too was awful. And so I bought dune and was happy. Thankyou risk, for setting these events into motion.

A lot of fun if you like original Risk.  Using the ring as a random time limit is a nice touch and forces careful planning(do you shore up defenses or stay on the attack?).  Having a different map other than the same old boring Earth map is nice also.  You have to study it carefully to see who you're really bordering.  Leaders and fortresses are also welcome additions.

RATING: 2
It may not seem as complete as the "trilogy edition", but I feel that in some ways this edition is the better game.  It has a more manageable number of territories with less dead ends, and it doesn't take an overly long time to play.  The theme is not well implemented, though, and the board is ugly.

Very nice game. Remarkably good varian of risk. addition of the extra map in the expansion really adds to the game (although that map was sold under cover of a full game price. Real exploitation.) Good, tense, fun, fickle game nevertheless.

RATING: 5
A variant of Risk. Still mainly dice rolling, but the speed which with the fellowship moves adds an extra touch to the gameplay. The endgame can be a real pain, however.

RATING: 5.95
I never really understood the attraction of Risk when there are games like Axis and Allies or Shogun/Samurai Swords/Ikusa, but at least they made one with a Lord of the Rings theme.

RATING: 5
It's RISK with LOTR skin ... bought prematurely tho. Later got the "Trilogy" Edition. Added some minis and character specific mechanic. Served as a poorman's Wor of the Ring for awhile!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Time limit mechanism is the best thing that could ever happen to risk.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A definite step up from RISK. 
The good: The cards, locations, leaders and ringbearers add quite a few layers to the otherwise silly dicefest of the original. 
The bad:Still random, oddly hobbled to only 4 players
The Ugly: pretty crooked for leaving out the last third of the map (only to resell the same game the next year with the whole thing)

Still, it addresses the biggest flaw of the original: The ring acts as an integral time limit! 

I do play this on occasion!

RATING: 5
The cast of miniatures are as ever, very well done. 

This is one of those RISK game that has an ending period and a definitive cooperation battle plan between good and evil. 

Which makes the dice rolling more acceptable as a simple system of battle attrition. 

The inclusion of adventure cards with leaders are both used concept but does not overwhelm the game like AD2210. 

Best of the RISK series. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Much better than original Risk and mainly 2 reasons for that. 1) Action-cards 2) Limited time-frame

Also having a LOTR-theme helps.

The classic game of world domination merged with Tolkien's defining fantasy work. There are some specific scenario cards to allow for different play options, but I haven't used these in years and forget what they were like.

An excellent version of Risk. The game ends when the ring goes off the board, nearing Mount Doom. Feels like it's not telling the entire story though, the trilogy edition is better. 

Can be played in teams as well.

RATING: 6
Although the use of terrain (mountains, bridges) is a neat new mechanic, this game just doesn't feel like Risk. Unlike Risk 2210 A.D., the new cards don't enhance the old Risk strategies but pull you AWAY from the old feelings of Risk. The port movement seems imbalanced, and the fortification rule being unlimited makes this game feel very much out of synch with the Lord of the Rings books.

Played maybe a dozen times. OK game, doesn't really do it for me. I can't say I hate it but I just find this themed variant pretty dull overall.

The fact that the expansion was not made available in North America would have really ticked me off if I had been the one in my group to shell out for it.

RATING: 6
Risk with a turn limit and themed play. Fun, but the turn limit gives a lot of power to the last player to go, and the theme is trumped by the "trilogy edition" which makes this game both pointless and dumb. Way to go Hasbro, you jerks.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pretty nice risk mod.  For me it needs to be altered more to fit my image of Middle Earth. (Yes I know this is risk, but there is no way in hell orcs, with a one unit advantage are going to take Lothlorien or Rivendell, same goes for elves taking evil lands.)

Meh. We enjoyed it. But it was a little...hmmm, heavy? Someone mentioned house rules are a must and they are correct. You will need a few games under your belt to get the full knack of this game.

I would rather play War of The Ring.

I love the Lord of the Rings. I love Risk. Win-win, right? Not exactly, and for really only two reasons. First of all, the entire top and bottom corners on the right side are usually neglected by myself and all those playing with me. Why bother adding them to the game if no one can be brought to care about them? Second, and far more importantly, turtling on strongholds is ridiculously overpowered, and skews the game completely in my opinion.

I hate Risk because of the endless dice rolling, but I collect LotR things, so I bought this game. Because it has a limited amount of turns before the game is over, I find it tolerable to play. Also, it plays differently than the original Risk, so it's not just Risk with a new look.

RATING: 4.33
It's Risk.  It's Lord of the Rings.  That helps.  It does have better bits than regular Risk that make it more enjoyable, but it is still very much Risk.  It doesn't add that much from the old model.  The Middle Earth helps, and having a timer to end the game is a huge boon to it, but I still don't like the Risk style of combat.  I don't really have an urge to pull this out ever.

Black army: 2 leader shields, 4 cave trolls, 12 dark riders, & 25 orcs
Red army: 2 leader shields, 6 cave trolls, 11 dark riders, & 36 orcs
Box has one split corner that was taped in an amateurish manner and is experiencing shelf wear on many corners and edges.

Game is complete.  Game board; 4 armies...each with 2 leader shields, 6 eagles/trolls, 12 dark riders/riders of Rohan, 40 elves/orcs; 1 ring; 3 red dice; 2 black dice; 2 wild cards; 42 territory cards (9 evil, 9 good, 24 neutral); and one rule set.  Aside from a somewhat wrinkly ruleset, all cards and pieces are in very good condition.  The box has no split corners, but a four inch section of the left edge is peeling up a bit, as is the bottom right corner/side.  Shelf wear is evident, but box is solid.

Disclaimer- I am one of the few on here who actually likes risk.  I own many variations of risk and while I like this one, I do not enjoy it as much as some of the others.  It is MASSIVE and set up takes a while and the map is a lot of territory to cover.  The ring and cards can make this a unique experience and I would think those who do not like regular risk for the typical reasons would like this much more.

The rules don&#039;t seem to be too clear about the &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; players are working jointly, or as individuals.

Remarkably well-done RISK variant set in Middle-Earth and covering aspects of the book and the film. Of note is the decision by the designer and publisher to make the trek of the Fellowship determine the length of the game. That certainly lightens the burden of learning the game while keeping the scale of the game and flavor of the theme intact. Loses a point for being for only four players and having an incomplete map of Middle-Earth. Get the "Trilogy Edition" of this game instead.

Played per the rules, the game is broken.  If you are way behind in the game, and the ring is about to end it, your best bet is to attempt to take over as much territory as possible.  Sure, you may lose, or the ring may not finish the game, but at least you have a chance at winning.  Way worse then normal Risk, despite the nicely designed theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The missions make this more interesting and lead to more action on the board than in classical risk. The ring is an automatic game clock so you don't have to wait until the blue are erased...
And i love the theme, of course :-)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I don't like RISK so my rating reflects that, as it's pretty much the same game. It's better than RISK because the ring is a timer mechanism so the game will end (quicker than normal risk), but it's still risk ... I'd much rather play War of The Ring for this type of game.

Not in the same league as Castle Risk - the only good 
game of the franchise I've seen. This one has too much
luck, and too many gimmicks. Add the hard to read/view
map (especially the bridges vs blocking rivers) and this
really doesn't have any redeeming aspects.

At least this one isn't too long.

This is a suprisingly disappointing version of Risk.  Perhaps the trilogy edition is better, but this seems to be missing something.  Still, for Risk and Lord of the Rings fans, I find this is viable alternative to Classic Risk, though I think my friends would disagree.  The production quality is better than average.

This is a fun version of Risk if you play the old way, because of the new places from the book/movie.  Also, love the pieces!  But when you play the Lord of the Rings way where the ring is moving, it's even more fun!

Bought this second hand but have parts on order from Hasbro.  Will be getting new complete armies, new map board, new dice, new ring, new cards, and rules.  Mine was missing rules, and a few pieces including the ring.  The box cover corners are worn and one is torn, but repairable.  All in all, for the $2 I paid for the game and the $21 in new replacement parts, I will have a $99 game for $23...and one that I enjoy playing.  This is just a little less enjoyable than the trilogy edition that I also own.  I had originally purchased it just for spare parts for the Trilogy edition, but with the replacement parts it should be a complete game.  I had downloaded and printed the rules and was able to play it out of the box.

RATING: 7
I've enjoyed playing this game ever since it came out. My friends and I played it so much that we wore out my old copy. Unfortunately, as I've grown as a gamer, Risk has really shown its age, so this game doesn't have quite the same appeal to me as it once did. Still, I would be willing to play it. It is the best Risk map that I have played on.

For those wishing to try out alternatives to this game, try out:
-Risk Legacy, for a quick and ever-changing Risk experience. This is especially good if you have a consistent gaming group.
-Game of Thrones: The Board Game, for a more immersive war experience, where deals are expected to be made and broken.
-The War of the Ring, for a completely encapsulating Lord of the Rings experience. Highly recommended for those of us who love the world of Tolkien.

The game itself isn't that bad, but hasborg tried to suck every last dime out of a gamer by releasing the much better (at the same price!) trilogy edition, it still wouldn't have been so bad if it wasn't for the fact that they didn't show that half the board was missing on the box, in terms of gameplay, though it is a nice new twist on risk

Not too bad. The final scoring needs to be kept in mind as you play and then you can try time your moves to make a final grab for territory on the final turn. However the final turn is determined by a 50-50 die roll so the end can take a while to finally finish. You need to look at the map carefully to determine attack routes. Based on 1 play.

I might actually move this up a rating after I play it a few more times.  I think some of the rules changes (i.e. the adventure cards, the finite time of play, the lack of an incredible explosion of armies at the end of a game to save somebody, etc.) really helped the game.  I really liked the theme as well, and it didn't feel as tacked on as expected.

RATING: 8
A good but simple variant of Risk. It feels like a lot of opportunities given by the theme have been missed. There's little point in getting this if you already have Risk, I think: War of the Ring is a more complex and satisfying experience overall, though this is much easier to get into.

i think there is one red man missing, not that it makes any difference really unless you managed to deploy EVERY single soldier and ALL the larger creatures as well in one massive army (never going to happen) :)

A present for my wife's birthday. I was lucky this one was on sale. It's a little better than classic RISK I think, but some aspects are disappointing. I've already started to make additonal rulesets for it, some based on other people's work. If there's interest I'll publish them.

Got this game for $1 at Goodwill, and it was worth every cent.  The components are all decent quality, the artwork is kind of "meh", and the gameplay is Risk.

I do find that rolling to move the ring bearers can make the game take way too long, so we generally just move them every round instead.

I'd probably rather just play the StarCraft version for the objectives, but if I'm in a Middle Earth-y mood, this game will certainly suite.

It's better than regular risk (as long as you're looking to play with 2-4 people). The ring movement means the game will end in a reasonable time frame and before the action gets stale. The cards and leaders spice up the original Risk enough to add some more excitement. Not an overly complex game but it's worth playing.

We like this one!  With 2 players, it is quick and fun.  With 4, there is more strategy.  The movement of the ring puts in a nice time limit so the game never last 4 to 5 hours (or more) like regular Risk.  Overall, it is very fun but I have found that with two or three players, it really goes VERY fast and the winner is determined very early...whoever starts out well with positioning and dice will win.  We usually play two full games in 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  Best with four players.

Still a bit luck bound but I'm a sucker for Middle-Earth games. The theme is implemented quite well except for the players representing the forces of good being required to fight each other in 3 or 4 player games - also the ring/fellowship is abstracted out (although this is used as an interesting game mechanic to limit game length) so no Frodo, Legolas et al.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I don't usually go for themed games but I thought this looked ok. I wasn't dissapointed as the the gameplay was much improved on original Risk, especially with the cards and the LOTR connection. Been waiting for the expansion set for years and just found out today that they've been around since 2003.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not at all bad. Ok, it is Risk, you can't get away from that, but the added time limiter and the cards turn this into a fun game (to mu surprise I must add). As a Tolkien affectionado I also appreciate playing in Middle-Earth for a change. The maps feels more interesting an fun than the standard Risk map.

I have only tried this with the expansion which affects the rating, I guess it would be less fun without it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Good old Risk, but in Middle Earth.  Players play a "good" or "evil" faction, whack away at each other, while the Ring moves through Middle Earth (this represents the Fellowship, and is the game's clock).  Rivers, bridges and mountains channel the action in certain directions providing some interesting tactical nuances.  Action cards spice things up and are an additional source of victory points.  The game board stops north of Gondor/Mordor, so we can assume an expansion is on the way.

Standard Risk was once my favourite board game, but now it bores me. Lord of the Rings Risk is a much better version in my opinion, because of the mobile heroes, which boost your dice, and the multiple mission cards and battle effect cards. Having a destined end condition (the ring reaching mount doom) instead of the standard last man standing mode is also a relief, because Risk games tend to take hours. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
An acceptable and entertaining Risk variant with the bonus of a built-in timer in the shape of the Ring Bearer moving across the board.  It suffers from Risk's usual complaints about 'too much luck' but side steps the length issues quite nicely.  It also has nice bits and is reasonably fun to play.

Nice dice fest. It's Risk. With another theme. With some sort of additional strategic layer (the journey of the Ring, new card-stuff, Leader-rules...)

An ok game but only for four players, the three player version isn't very balanced because of the initial setup.  Two people end up very close to each other and the third person has much more room to expand unharrased.As a four player game it is decent, leaders, strongholds, and sites of power add excitement and new elements to the game.  Extremely fluid, don't expect to have a "kingdom" and hold it for most of the game like "Risk 2210 AD."  The ending time of the game depends on the roll of a dice so it could take 5 turns or 8 or even 15(very unlikely though).I would recomend "War of the Ring" over this game though.

The rules are atrocious for this game, and the game play has serious issues. The worst part about it, is that Hasbro designed it quickly to cash in on the Lord of the Rings movie when the third movie wasn't even out in theatres yet. So they ended the board 2/3rds of the way, with the promise of an "Expansion" Instead we got the trilogy edition of Risk and no expansion (in Canada that is).

Basically all those eager LOTR fans that bought this game were SOL and told "just buy another copy if you don't like it." well stuff it up your @$$ hasbro. This doesn't even go in my games cabinet. It's in a box, having only been played once.

Edit: I have since sold this to someone.. Good Riddence

This lord of the rings version brings a few twists to the classic which are mostly good. I think it tends to finish a bit early without the expansion. And also the random end is not a very good solution and can lead to some weird endings.

RATING: 5
The fact that they didn't include the whole map and you have to buy an expansion to get it makes the rating lower.

Time to restate my dislike for this game, it is not that it is an all together horrible game but, for me at least, this game relies too heavily on the classic concept of dice rolls to influence battles.

Ring progresses across the map.  It makes for an effective game timer, so the game can't drag on forever.  I also consider this among the top 3 Risk Variants both for play and presentation.  I use the figures all the time in Wizards Quest, and they really spice up that game.

This is the UK edition from 2002 - i.e. it's unexpanded. It has the cardboard ring. The box is a little scuffed but the contents are still unopened so the game is in VGC. I know it's not seen as a brilliant game next to the expanded version (though I don't see a lot of difference)  and I'll be taking that into account when I choose what I expect to get for it, so don't be shy :)

RATING: 6
Halloween day saw Parker Brothers‚Äô Middle Earth Risk arrive on store shelves. Being a big fan of the original Risk as well as Risk 2250 in more recent times, I had very high hopes for his one. Unfortunately the result is a bit of a mess and fails on many levels, coming across as a greedy rush job to capitalize on a hot license.

The basic core of the rules will be familiar to anyone who has ever played Risk. The core combat rules are the same with the added complications of leaders, fortresses and limits on the sizes of attacking armies. Territory cards are collected to turn in for additional units and the map features the same country and continent bonus system.

The game board is a tad small. It seems an attempt to retain the look of the hand drawn maps of Tolkien while at the same time moving everything about slightly for gameplay purposes and adding color to differentiate areas. A legend on the side of the map shows the bonuses collected for controlling complete areas yet, irritatingly, lacks the corresponding color legend that every single version of Risk until now had featured. Sea routes connect a couple of the port cities. The Fellowship, represented by a gold ring (did you ever think to see a mass produced one ring?), moves across the board during play, ending the game when they move off of the map. The alarming indicator here is that the game board ends at the Dead Marshes. Both the sea routes and the route of the Fellowship simply wander off the game board. This is a strong indicator that an ‚Äúexpansion‚Äù is already in the works. If they plan one for each movie you‚Äôre looking at $150 for what will ultimately be one complete game.

The counters are moderately detailed with the ‚Äúevil‚Äù armies looking quite a bit better than the ‚Äúgood‚Äù armies. It doesn‚Äôt help that the evil armies are in red and black while the good armies are stuck with fluorescent lime and lemon yellow, making them a colossal eyesore. Other than quick lip service in the rules, the whole notion of good and evil has zero relevance to the game other than determining starting territories. There is no alliance or cooperation between good or evil players, and no optional rules with the game to provide means to play this way. Perhaps these will be in one of the ‚Äúexpansions‚Äù.

The game also includes a deck of Adventure Cards that provide goals during gameplay as well as special tactical effects or bonuses. These are well done and add a lot of fun to the game. It appears that this deck was where most of the design team‚Äôs time was spent.

The Fellowship‚Äôs movement across the gameboard seems little more than a missed opportunity. There are cards that hinder them that can be played to delay the end of the game but other than that they have zero effect on gameplay. No bonuses or penalties as they pass through your area; no reason for good to want them to win, no reason for evil to want them to fail.

‚ÄúMissed opportunity‚Äù is really the phrase that best sums up this game. There are several good innovations here that just aren‚Äôt executed well. This one needed another month or two and I expect that we‚Äôll be seeing a host of house rules for it to bring it more inline with what wargamers were hoping it would be.

RATING: 3
Gameplay has some slight improvements over classical "Risk", but keeps its basic problems. It still takes long. The theme is poorly applied, putting all peoples in a free-for-all war. Game ends abruptly and feels incomplete - just because it's just half the game, of course (you need the "Trilogy Edition" or the expansion).

I bought this when the first movie came out because I really wanted to learn Risk, was afraid that it would be too complicated, and thought the movie tie-in would help.  As it turned out, I still didn't have anyone to play with but my how far I've come in my board game tastes. :-)

Well, it's a good game, it's an improvement from the original and it's different than 2210. Even though I did better at my first attempt at this one than most of my previous with 2210, I still think I prefer 2210. Played the complete version a while ago and while it does make for an even better gameplay, it still fails to live up to the heights of 2210.

This game is useless now that "War of the Ring" exists.  I traded my copy because it sucked.  This is a really terrible game, adding bad mechanics to an already weak system.  The map is better than standard risk and the components are decent, but the game stinks.  It seemed so thrown together and you didn't even play through to mordor unless you bought an expansion only sold overseas or the new trilogy edition.  What crappy marketing.

This is a real hit for me (and the rest of my group!). The rule changes are sufficient to make it feel like a 'new' game but there's enough of the 'old' Risk to still feel familiar. The artwork is great and the bits are nice. Pity there couldn't be 4 *different* sets rather than 2 'good' + 2 'evil'. Only let down by a slightly 'fuzzy' feel to the rules. They'll be plenty of discussions for the first fews plays - especially if you've not played 'vanilla' Risk.

I'm *really* hacked off the expansion went out of print so quickly - and I am NOT going to pay 3x face value on EBay!

Basically RISK, with a few new rules and a distinct turn limit that is determined fairly randomly so it avoids the "last player wins" mentality from RISK 2210. However, the game also lacks many of the enhancements that raise RISK 2210 above regular RISK.

Avoid it unless you are a RISK fan, and pick up the Trilogy Edition instead.

Almost the best Risk game made. Much better than classic risk. The addition of leaders and strongholds and ring cards made this game an instant classic.

Ok, little addendum about the rating. This relates to the multiplayer version. I can see the game with a decent amount of players... well, still not being fun, but at least being a bit of a tolerable diversion while doing something else. A social lubricant, I guess.
Problem with 2p mode is mainly that it exacerbates the worst swingy, stupid luck factor of the game. You can't temporarily band together or bunker up or whatever in a 1v1 scenario. One player does well means the other does badly. And when this is a matter of pure luck due to carddraw or dice rolls then this sucks even more.
Yeah, 2p mode gets a definite "1".

What's there to say about the actual game? It's Risk. Added on top we have a timer mechanic (thankfully. Though still lengthy), some event/power/quest cards and special minis. I think there already existed versions of Risk with the area cards and leader mechanic but those could've been new as well.

Oh, and the rulebook sucked Though this could've just been due to it being the Dutch version. Rulebooks aren't always brilliant, translated rulebooks...

Love the movies, the books are okay, this game is alright, but apparently I don&#039;t like RISK, even if you do make it shorter and add more stuff.  Decent little components.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The abilities you can draw in this game, is simply too random in and varied in power, that lucky drawing pretty much settles the game. :-/

I do love the original RISK game though, and also the Star Wars variant. This one though, is just too random for my liking.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
I like this edition better than the trilogy edition because it doesn't have that cluster fuck at the bottom of the board (Mordor and southeast) that makes it seem weighted too heavily toward the evil side.  Also, it's shorter, since the ring has a lot less spaces to travel.

very nice variant of the original game, but the ring drastically shortens the playing time - you can't take the world in a single surprise attack, it needs time! (for a game of Risk usually up to five hours :) ) so leave the ring aside and let the elves conquer middle earth *gg*

It's risk with a few bells and whistles which generally detracted from it 'being risk'. You'll probably like it better than risk if you don't like risk. I hate the fact that the scoring mechanism strongly favours the player who played last when the followship leaves the board. If the followship are in the last square, you have to go all out for territory, and if the game doesn't end, you're scuppered...

Better than the original Risk since there's a time limit and some additional strategy added. The core game mechanics are unfortunately still the same.

Extremely entertaining and fun; I just wish more emphasis was put on the storyline (ie good guys shouldn't fight to death against one another, the fellowship's movement should reflect the presence of the armies (good or evil) that occupy the territory that it crosses...)

RATING: 3
I am not a fan of original RISK rules, and this is simply that, with a strange deck of cards to replace the armies.  I understand that most folks play RISK with rules such that you can move armies, but in this game, you cannot.I did own this, but I gave it away

Just played normal risk with it, 2 players. Was abandoned by second player becoming disinterested with the prospect of a 3 hour game even though their army was winning by a mile. Seems first player has a massive advantage on turn 1 because they can load up and attack very weak defence, but it appears every turn is similar.
Also played solo full rules. Leaders and missions add a little more to it and the ring move timer is ok.

The very fact that everyone has created their own modified rules for this game just shows how tired and broken the rules are for this series.  I won't even go into the miserable edition that they released after The Two Towers that didn't even include the full map of Middle Earth!  If the game wasn't themed LOTR, nobody would touch this game for its lousy mechanics, unclear map, and lack of strategy.  I am sorry that I spent my money on this game, instead of the many others that are much more worthy.

A gift from my brother. I like the LotR trilogy, Risk is an ok game. I would play this RISK over any other risk due to the fact that this one has a "doomsday clock" and will most definitely end before the grass grows. I'm just not feeling it should be rated any higher.

Risk with the LOTR theme.  Great artwork.  Minor changes added that add more more strategies that the classic Risk.
Still a lot of luck but with more control. Variable time limit that was added with the ring.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
I never thought I'd willingly play Risk again, but my friend lent this to us so I could play with my sons. It's still Risk, but the missions give you some direction to your conquest other than just region control, as well as adding LOTR theme, along with a fun map and army units, and most important is the ticking clock of the Fellowship passing through the map that both discourages turtling and makes the game go by in a very reasonable amount of time, or even feels too short. But makes it good with kids. 

I'd rather try the 2003 version that includes Gondor and Mordor, but still wouldn't buy it. But for fans of Risk and LOTR, this is a FAR better game.

I purchased this game and felt that something was missing.  Sure enough, an entire section of Middle Earth is not on the board, including Mordor!

The only positive that this game has over the Trilogy edition is that it takes up less space and is slightly easier to set up.

RATING: 7
a timely variant to the classic engine that is risk. fun, and easy to play. the biggest bonus to this game is the fact that it has a variable turn limit, this game will end before global domination occurs (ie, oringinal risk) so its easier to get borderline fans to play... the fear of 6-8 hour plus games is removed :) which is nice when you want to expand the pool of talent you draw from.

1 / 5 - Bad.

Shame. Some good ideas (leaders, strongholds etc) ruined by the idiotic "game ends on random turn" which makes the preceding play pointless: the person who gets the last turn almost always wins. Some of the pieces seem to be modeled from grotesque bodily fluids and the board is confusing to look at as well: it's hard to tell which areas border which others. Totally unthematic. Could be vastly improved by some simple rule tweaks. See my review for more details: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/1440682

I like it alright -- but the randomness of some of the event cards made me downright crabby (what?  Remove some of my carefully deployed battalions??) and just absorbing all of the new rules (once you've drawn an Adventure card, no more cards -- except Event cards -- can be played that turn...oh, uh, what's the difference between those cards again?) was a chore.  The next session should flow better, but we were all rooting for  a high die roll for the Ring to leave the board (which signals game end) and all groaned loudly when we failed to get one four times running.

Somehow manages to make base risk even more random; the mission cards have wildly varying usefulness/power, but no "cost" associated with playing them (and you're limited to 3 in your hand, so if you can't play one you can't draw a new one).The region cards add another layer of randomness -- if you're lucky enough to draw one of each kind plus a couple with a region you control on it, you get a major advantage over your opponent, through no reason other than just being lucky enough to draw the right cards. I like the ring game-ending mechanism though.

I actually liked this quite a bit, as much as Risk 2210.  I'd like to use the Rings of Power variant and see how that works.  Have had some good games with this.  They didn't go far enough in really making this unique.  You'll know they've succeeded the moment the grognards start buying Risk games!

UPDATE:  Downgraded it a bit.  The timing mechanism of the Ring only benefits wives and girlfriends. I think the only way to play this now is with a variant and the clock ripped out.  Shame.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The movement of the fellowship does make this game end in, what feels like, a very quick time, which does make the supplied ratio of playing pieces seem incorrect as you never have the opportunity to swell large enough to use the larger multiples. Additionally, without the wraparound nature of the map, it's easier to play defensively.

RATING: 8
I love this one. The adventure cards add a fresh touch to the formula and in Boardgamegeek's forums there are several house rules that makes the game even more epic! I once saw an alternative map in a forum that was more accurate with the OG map (but it was sloppy made with paint xD). If you're going to buy this game, buy the trilogy version instead, this one doesn't have Mordor, Gondor and Harad (they are part of the expansion).

Lord of the Rings risk trilogy edition is great but this one scams you by giving you an incomplete game where you are conquering middle earth except, WHAT, mordor and gondor are missing and if you want them, you have to wait a couple years like a fool, like I did and get the new edition which isn't an expansion, nooooo, it's a whole new game which means your original is worthless, WORTHLESS!

Love the board--even though the map dimensions are a little skewed. Piece molds are alright. 

The One Ring included upon purchase (over 10 years ago) was quite nice, though we lost it after a couple months. Admittedly we were kids. One does not simply put away a finished board game.

Best RISK type game i've ever played (and I've played a few). The use of event cards, leaders and Sites greatly add to the strategy element of the game and makes it really stand out as a great strategy board game.

RATING: 5
Well, for 10 euro's I thought this might be an improvement over the default game. Mostly just because it has a different, more balanced map, and there are minor assignments.

The action cards are not particularly balanced, which causes some unexpected large swings of power. Of particular note is the card that not only halves the attacking force but adds an equivalent force to the defenders.

Great added game components with the addition of leaders and strongholds. LotR is ok but Risk is great.  The map is fairly balanced. Fun with 2 or 4 players. I also prefer to play to completion verses till the ring leaves the map signalling a tallying of points for a victor.

RATING: 2
One point for the nice plastic pieces and the second because I am a fan of the book and the films.
One of the worst "strategic" game I ever played.
You cannot take hold of any continents. The river and the bridges even more are annoying.
Whoever is lucky with dices ends the game and therefore wins the game.
You like risk?
Stick to risk 2210 AD

RATING: 4
A decent version of Risk. The movement of the ring ensures that the game won't go too long. Some of the cards can seem too powerful at times, especially when combined. Still feels too dependent on lucky die rolls for my taste.

More strategy than vanilla risk. The theme is ok but seems wrong without the other half of the map. I like the addition of strongholds, leaders and missions/events.

RATING: 5
This version is glaringly and infuriatingly incomplete, with the map cropped at the south end, and the crucial regions of Gondor, Mordor (yes, the two key players in the war) and Harad all absent. The idea was that you would buy the expansion pack, but this expansion pack is extremely rare and expensive now on ebay.

Anyway, that is one annoyance. The second key issue is imbalance: whoever gets the last turn will probably win by sprawling out over as many provinces as possible; making all the run up to that last go seem pointless.

Other than these issues, I did enjoy playing the first few times.

Another [i]Risk[/i] variant that didn't disapoint initially, but became a disapointment years later.  The game itself isn't that bad.  It adds a depth to the original game by cards that effect play, locations that have effects on battles, and new pieces that make your armies more powerful.  Anti-climatic because the game ends when the Ring moves off of the board.  What was the most disapointing is that I understood that as they released The Two Towers and Return of the King movies, they would introduce two more LOTR risk games that you would add to the initial LOTR risk board to create a triple sized LOTR risk board!  But instead, they replaced the LOTR Risk with a slighty larger version, [i]LOTR Risk - The Trilogy Edition[/i].

I really liked this version of Risk and thought that the randomized number of turns was in keeping with the unknown perils that the fellowship would have to face to destroy the one ring. However, one in the group did not like the wild swings in power that took place at the very end of the game while we waited tenuiously each turn to see if the fellowship roll was >3 and thus end the game. Hey it's still Risk but the extra LotR flavor and mechanics make it better in my opinion. Definately one of the best LotR movie spinoff games.

Risk is  a love/hate thing for me.  The good thing about this variant is you can play good vs. evil if you want which takes Risk-Politics out of the equation.  I know politics are a huge part of the game but sometimes it's nice to just play simple old strategy.

RATING: 4
Risk with mission cards (which acquire more troops + VPs) with a turn track timer so the game ends in a reasonable time. Make sure you conquer a territory each turn to get a card for the mid-game surge of reinforcements. Aim to control all the territories in one of the regions if you can to get more troops and end-game VPs, but good luck at that as the other players all get a shot at winning just one of them back before your next turn. Also aim to own stronghold regions for the bonus VPs and defend them in force. But ... the next time I want to play a 2-3 hour game where everyone gangs up on the leader all game to keep things even and then the winner turns out to be whoever gets to go last as they get the final all-out push to grab VPs (1 per territory, and end-game is controlled by a die roll), I'll know exactly what to pull out.

Lets be honest, this is Risk with a Lord of the Rings theme. Not bad but recommended to play only with alliances (Good vs. Evil).

Pros:
* Production quality is top notch.
* Includes a cool metal ring (+.5 to the rating).
* Force limited time constraint by moving the ring reduces the pain of playing out a full game of Risk.

Cons:
* Setup is too fiddly.
* The manual should be streamlined as the rules are too convoluted to learn quickly.
* Certain rules are not clear and have to be interpreted.
* A 4-player game without alliances is too chaotic.

Of all the Risk games I've played (original, Castle, 2210, Original Trilogy, and this game), this one is my least favorite.  The minis are pretty neat looking (except for the leader pieces), but the cards don't work nearly as well as in 2210 or Original Trilogy.  If you're looking for a LOTR wargame I'd recommend War of the Ring- it's significantly more complex but still very playable and a much better game.

Although a lot of new things are added to Risk (leaders, event cards, strongholds, new board, etc.), which make the game much more interesting, I find the game ending somewhat dissatisfying.  There aren't a lot of turns, and it can end in somewhat a random way.  The player who turn it was last will have a lot of territories as a result.

Need to try again - think that 2 player may work better with 2 armies each. Board is indeed very hard to read in lots of places, which is silly. Nice pieces. Great value as a thrift game. Ring movement mechanism is frankly wierd, particularly as delaying the Fellowship is just as likely to benefit the Good as the Evil side -  but a turn limit is useful in Risk. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This game has the same mechanics of the original game, but with some characters and special places that modify a little bit the standard rules.  You need the expansion to play it well. Also there is a timer, represented by the ring's journey, that was put there to avoid the game to last forever. Nevertheless, it makes the players try a final blow when they feel that the game is going to end, and luck and dice rolls decide who will be the last player and, because of that, the winner. The journey is nice, but the end game mechanic is by far not well developed.

Beautifully produced game, but not very innovative, nor interesting, nor substantially different from regular "RISK" - which I grew tired of a long time ago.  I cannot recommend this game as anything other than a collector's item.  Sold it on eBay and frankly will never miss it.

Es bastante divertido (todo lo que puede ser un Risk), pero no me gust√≥ el tema del movimiento del anillo. No pegaba nada con el Risk.
Ademas el mapa es horroroso, y el tablero se hace peque√±o y engorroso.
Lo acabe vendiendo, por que me gust√° mas el original.

RATING: 6
One of the better Risk variants I've played, although pretty cheesed that they basically replaced this game with the Trilogy Edition. (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/8107) I paid Hasbro a few extra bucks and got the missing pieces to expand my version so it's cool. Fixes Risk's length problem by introducing the Ring traveling across the board, and adds some tension since you don't know exactly when the game will end.  Mission cards also get you to break out of turtling.  Still, probably too many choke points on the map, but they had to stay accurate to the world I guess. :P

Risk was the sleepover game of choice when I was a kid. You could start after dinner and play through the night, downing Cokes and chowing on Pizza, thinking you were about to win, only to have the momentum swing against you for like the 8th time. When I didn't know a whole lot better, that was fun. Now, it seems kind of clunky. But enter LOTR Risk! Unlike the countless Monopoly versions out there, this one actually does make use of its theme well. It even has a built in component that keeps the game from going on forever, as the ring constantly moves across the board, acting as a sort of timer. Fun, but still, the combat is a bit flawed.

Colourful variant of Risk. This introduces some welcome elements that Risk itself could use, like having a more or less fixed ending, and being able to reinforce and attack in the same turn. But it's a lot less clean than Risk, and the cards do disturb game balance. So I prefer Risk, but it could definitely learn from this.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A fun variant of basic Risk using the upper 2/3rds of Middle-Earth. The game has a built in timing device which will end the game before it becomes an endurance trial like its forebear. But while the game is very pretty there's still some minor issues, the biggest of which is that the game really only includes material from the first 2 movies and not Return of the King. It's a fun game with nice production value but most BGG'ers will probably want to play a different game because this is, after all, Risk. 

The game parts are very pretty and stylized, although the map can be a bit challenging to play on due to territory borders being difficult to see and not drawn with enough contrast on the board. Dittos for the rivers/bridges.

RATING: 3
While I love the theme of the game (being a LOTR fan), and enjoy the original risk, this is a horrible game.  The leaders are a fun idea, but there are so many balance issues with the rest of the rules that playing is an exercise in absurdity.  For example, regions have so many connecting boundaries to neighboring regions they are almost impossible to hold.  There are way too many ways to get new armies out onto the board.  For example, turning in an infantry-cavalry-creature cardset allows a player to bring out 10 armies on their 4th turn -- with lucky events and a few good missions, we had 2 players in a row get 21 and 22 armies on the 4th turn (while I got 6 -- and I had a region!).  The power swings in this game are immense, and ultimately unsatisfying, as anything you do can either be easily undone with a large army, or simply walked around due to the abundance of adjacency connections.

Not a bad game if you like dice rolling and a lot of luck. The missions lead to a game play where armies suddenly march all over tha map to conquer a region for a turn, then give the area up to march to the next mission. The game end is triggered by a die roll at a certain time, and usually the last active player can make enough points during his turn to win the game, at least when the player skills are about even.

The ring-as-game-clock is a good idea, but Risk is a mediocre enough base game, and I'm not enough of a LoTR fan, for this edition to be anything but vaguely pointless.

Like 'light' wargames like this and it's good that you can play with more than two, although it feels odd that you'll then get Good v Good and/or Evil v Evil at some point. Problem of original Risk was always the length, but this is nicely sorted by the progression of The Ring in this themed version.

Battling in Middle earth with many of added nuances really helps this game.  Also, like the limited time aspect that pushes you to be more aggressive rather than the build and wait strategy commonplace in Risk.

Horrible!

I bought this when it was first released (before the 2nd film came out).  The fact that they released this prior to the 2nd film, and therefore left half of the world missing, is ridiculous, especially since they didn't release an expansion, but rather just re-released the game with the whole world after the 2nd film came out.

Horrible.

A wasted opportunity.  First, shouldn't ever have been sold as a standalone game.  Second, no choice about ring movement?  That should be a key strategic decision and instead it's just a timekeeping mechanic.  I had to house-rule it to buggery and then decided to abandon it altogether when War of the Ring came out.  Basically, if you want Lord of the Rings Risk, buy War of the Ring and forget about the 'Risk' component.

I love The Lord of the Rings and Risk and so was pumped when my uncle got me this game for Christmas several years ago.  Unfortunately, it's incomplete!  They only included two-thirds of the map, with the rest supposedly offered in an expansion--lame!  Then, they had the gall to not release the expansion in the US--super lame!

The "Original Trilogy Edition" apparently contains the whole map, but I already have this edition, dammit, I don't want to buy another!  Plus, the expansion comes with a Minas Tirith mini-game that looks fun.  Would love love love to track down a copy of that expansion.

This game gets a middling score for the map ridiculousness.  Otherwise, it's pretty good.  Good minis, good bits, interesting tweaks to the classic formula.

The only reason it's better than regular Risk is the theme. Well, I guess the missions are kind of cool, although very often absolutely impossible to achieve. Still a dicefest.

Fairly lame with the addition of the story line. LoTRs is awesome, Risk is awesome but together they are nothing. To each their own.

One of the better RISK games out there. It's still RISK though

While some balance issues, questionable color choices for the Good forces, and the decreased maximum number of players handicap this game, LotR Risk is a vast improvement on the original, adding sea routes, fortifications, leaders, and cards that can modify access between territories. 

While the game doesn't convey an especially deep LotR tone, it does nevertheless provide a rich fantasy element, and its sturdy and attractive pieces are a definitive improvement over basic Risk pieces, being far more enjoyable to play.

A favorite of my gaming groups.

I own this game apparently. Someone left it at my house years ago. We only played it once and I don't remember anything about it. So I haven't rated it because that just wouldn't be fair. I'd play it and then rate it but I hate Risk. How the hell did this get in my house? I have no idea. I made poor life decisions at some point it seems.

Update: Traded! Hooray! My life is on the right track!

It's Risk! And it's LotR! Too bad it has only half of the world on the map! I give it a 7 because Risk gets very tedious after a while...

For some reason, our group started playing a lot of Risk. Bought the LOTR variation, just to get a another version. But really, Risk isn't that fun...

Too random - it's far too easy to win or lose based on how well you roll the dice.

Risk, but the added elements of looking for the One Ring/working to get it to Mordor changes the game play and adds a sense of urgency and replay-ability that is obviously missing from standard Risk.  Action cards, leaders and strongholds add in some depth and if played correctly can drastically change the game.  If you enjoyed LOTR, and enjoy theme adapted games, you should check this one out.

Theme is neat, but not enough difference from vanilla to make the game noticeably more enjoyable.

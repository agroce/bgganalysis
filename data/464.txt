This game has loads going for it: it's fun; it requires you to think, but not too much that your brain hurts; it has lovely components (Franjos version) and looks great out on the coffee table - bet lots of visitors will want to play; it plays well with 2-4 and even works as a fun solo game*; the referee Kangeroo adds a real twist and a touch of MENSA-type thinking to it (but I don't mean that in an off-putting way...  This is NOT a heavy game). Another advantage is that it can be had cheaply if you go to the right German games shop.

It can and probably should be played quite quickly (or at least not slowly).  There are strategies and tactics in it, but I don't think it's a game to spend too much analysis on.  Obviously, one tries not to get any one piece too isolated and it can be a bit like Carategena in that a clever play can be to line up a piece of your own, seemingly miles away, so that you can jump over it before anyone notices what you're up to.  To do this with several pieces is an endorphine moment.  Nice game!

*A bit like advanced Solitaire (without a formula):  taking turns for each side, you can either try to see how quickly you can finish with one side only, or to get all sides to cross the line.  You can vary this by using different amounts of colours each time.

I really liked the one play of this game.  It's abstract in the same way Hey! That's my Fish is.  
The end game is particularly interesting.  The dynamics of the game seem to change considerably when one player appears to be heading for a victory.

Better and deeper than it seems. It's quick but not simple, you must pay attention to every move, both your and opponents'. It's difficult to find but a great half way between filler and tactical game. Very good.

Played at Essen 2002 and again since.  Can be quite a heavy and chess-like if you approach it that way.  Depending upon who and how many you play with be prepared for some downtime between turns.  Easy to add more players than provided for, just add additional sets of pieces & perhaps reduce number of pieces per player.

A very simple concept but getting your roos round before the other players involves a lot of thought and isn't as easy as it may appear...

RATING: 7
It’s a nice light hearted game and an enjoyable puzzle working out your best move for a given turn. Occasionally there is room for some really clever manoeuvres, catapulting a Kangaroo vast distances around the billabong. For something light, fun and a little thinky I won’t go far wrong reaching for this.

A quick abstract for four players that doesn't involve too much calculation.  Some pretty significant chaos keeps it from being too involved, which can be either good or bad.  I think that it's short enough that this is not a problem.

This is a clever and cute race game that involves no luck.  It is like a game of checkers with the goal altered to that of a race.  Components are nice - even the faux leather map 'board'.  Easy to teach, but with good strategy options for those with a careful eye.  [GTI: AGSL]

Don't really like this type of game,  but the kangaroos are fun (cue Skippy noises),  and some long sequences are fun to achieve.  Getting left behind can be fatal.

The coupling of an elegant and challenging movement system with a race game - and we love race games - makes an ideal combination.

But be warned.  The movement system is so challenging, as I say, that you have to exert strong discipline and remind players that they are taking part in 'a race'!   Kangaroos are not great thinkers as far as I know.

Normally I love racing games, but this one bored me.  It's just a game of leapfrog, but one where turns can take a long time as players try to find the optimal move.

I normally like race games, but this one is really an abstract game with a racing goal.  It's all about creating and seeing series of jumps that will allow you to finish first, while ruining other players' jump sequences.

The wooden kangaroos were neat though!

RATING: 7.8
Hey! A 4-player totally tactical abstract that is fun to play.  Tell your friends.  Seriously very few things in board gaming beats pulling off a monster jump series in this game.  Or getting beat by a little kid in his very first game.  This is what gaming is supposed to be about.  Bringing people together to have fun. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quick, spatial race game. The mechanism for moving your pieces is like chequers but you can make symetrical moves of any length (like jump, 3 empty spaces, an opponent's kangaroo, 3 empty spaces land). You set up chains to get your kangaroos zooming around the billabong. It is great fun but is prone to taking ages as players hunt out that killer move. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Billabong was a solid multi-player abstract with some pretty wild dynamics. Each player has a team of four kangaroos that race around a board. First player to get all four across the finish line wins. On your turn you move one space or hop over other kangaroos. How far the other 'roos are away from you determines how far away you'll land. A legal move requires all the spaces in between you, the other 'roo, and the landing spot to be unoccupied. You can keep jumping if you continue to have legal moves. This creates some interesting slingshot effects, some important defensive play to keep great jumps away from others, and - I'm guessing with repeat plays - a heavy emphasis on having your 'roos work together. We played with four which my not be the ideal number since it really crowds the board making long hops difficult to set up (but allowing an abundance of short (h)opportunities).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Elegant.  It would be austere except for the theme and the fact that many people seem to find bouncing 'roos funny.  Allows for surprisingly clever moves on occasion.  Hits a very happy spot for me, especially in the route planning permutations.

I am not usually a fan of racing games at all. I aquired this game as part of a trade with another game I wanted more. I just played this with my wife and son and a friend of my sons. This has got to be one of the best racing games there is. I would definitely play this again, even with my regular gaming group. It has a lot of room for great tactics. There is no luck in this game.

Fresh, ingenious game. I can't help but be impressed with the design of the game but I'm not sure how much fun I have or how often I'd ask to play. Can't help but be reminded of other classic abstracts like checkers (unlimited jumping), chess (following long diagonals and lines), and backgammon (a race game to bear off your men). Exceedingly clever and handles multiple players for and abstract.

A jumping race game that requires much careful thought. It&#039;s a joy to pull off a multiple jump move! Although the down time can be long, you can occupy your time in between player turns by planning your next move. In a small way it is similar to Ricochet Robot as you plot the route your kangaroos must jump.

I have played about 75% of the 1300+ games I own and in my lifetime have played around 2,000 different games. This is my #1 favorite at this time.   

This was an instant classic with me, and a huge surprise as well, since one of my most detested games is checkers--checkers is at the very bottom of the list along with Parcheesi, yet Billabong has checker-like similarities, and is at the very top of my list.

It is an unusual racing game--Can start in any of over 200 squares, but you don't start the race until you cross the start line (of course), which might take a few moves. You have 5 kangaroos that jump their way around the board, and over the finish line into the Billabong (a small obstruction in the middle of the board) to cool off. There is also a referee that can be used to advance one's position, or to mark one's starting location. Very interesting, and different from other games I own. I love it.

You can keep jumping as long as your jumps are legal. I have seen players almost at the finish line but unable to cross it, who start jumping backwards around the board, recross the Start Line, start jumping forward using a different route, and clear the finish line, all in one move. I have played many games, yet still marvel at the creativity and surprise of unexpected moves. 

This is a beautifully simplistic game with pure strategy. No luck--no dice, no cards; just your positioning.

I really enjoy the theme and the great wooden kangaroos, but many other themes could be used, or none at all, like checkers.

Rules in German only in my version.  Found English rules on Game Cabinet.

This came in such a big box I was surprised when the board was a soft one, rolled up.  Nice quality, but it could have gone into a tube and used exactly 80% less shelf space.

It has been on the market since 1995, so I am surprised the mechanics haven't been copied often.

Another note:  Many times I am asked to bring games, and this is the first game where such a wide variety of people ask me to bring it.  I know half a dozen people would buy this game if they could just find it.

RATING: 6
A marsupian variant of chinese marbles and checkers.  Interesting moves can be found with even the slowest kangoroos.  My one gripe is the lack of clarity as to how to determine what constitutes the direction of movement.  I will look for clarification but since backward movement is allowed, we were a little confused as to what constitued a 2nd passing of the line.  Anyhow, I want to try it again with more than just 2 players as I think the game must scale perfectly.  More players means more combinations for movement.

Nifty abstract. The game is all about "my piece jumps yours" a la checkers, but your pieces are in a race, and they're kangaroos. Fun to set up really long jumps, but be warned that players can fall into AP in trying to do so.

Nice little race game which is basically a checkers or chinese checkers variant. Its one of the better  multiplayer abstracts I've played and it has a nice theme (mostly pasted but it works) 

Some room for clever play here which is where the game shines, the ability to set yourself up for nice jump combinations. Blocking is possible, you have to watch you don't set up your opponents and even if you don't you may be able to block a nice big combo of theirs if your watching. 

No luck, a little depth and wont run too long with 2 or 3 which I think are the optimal player numbers (2 with slight variant) keeping this as almost a meaty filler length. 4 would be a little chaotic but more importantly in this case just longer and more prone to AP 

Tidbit : With only 2 people add 4 kangaroos in equally apart locations where it also wont be too easy to make big jumps with them. This makes jumping a little easier and helps to simulate a 3 player game

Good family game for those with younger kids. Better for adults than something mindless like "Chutes and Ladders".

With 4 people this gets rather chaotic. I only played once and we didn't have time to finish; I'd like to try again some time. (OK, I've tried a second time.  AP heaven.  Make sure to place your shadow before moving a roo in case you need to backtrack, not to mention in case you need to jump over your own shadow across the finish line.)

There aren't many differences between Billabong and Chinese Checkers, at least on paper: both are race games, both can acommodate several players, in both the pieces can either move or leap during one turn. Billabong has a different board, less pieces for each player and a free setup. 

There is, though, one more difference: in Billabong the leaps aren't exactly over a neighbour piece, but over a piece at a certain distance, and falling as far from the piece jumped over as it is from the jumping piece before the leap (as long as the path is free). An extra piece is placed during a player's turn on the departure space of the piece being moved to help with further leaps and avoiding cycles.

This makes Billabong an extremely deep and satisfying race game, easy to learn but very difficult to play well.

RATING: 6
This is not a race game really. It's a totally abstract round-the-corner representation of Chinese Checkers. Plan all you like, but when your turn comes you're going to have re-evaluate the board, which leads to points deduction for killer downtime. Points addition because your turn is actually pretty interesting with lots of options and forward planning to engage in. Doesn't net out to me wanting to play more though.

I managed to find a like-new Amigo Spiele version of this game on the cheap on the BGG marketplace. What a great little game! And a lot of value for the $10 I paid for it. I've only played five 2-player games so far, but I'm really digging the mechanics and really enjoying exploring the strategies and how all this relates to the interesting board geometry. Would love to see how this scales for 3 and 4. As of right now, I would be willing to play this without a second thought.

A clever game of seeing the geometries of multiple jumps a la Ricochet Robot, but easier. Like Cartagena, don't let yourself get cutoff and alone while trailing the pack unless you've set up a foolproof long jump. The 2" tall kanga-meeples are terrific.

Takes a bit too long for my liking, and reminds me too much of draughts, which I am rubbish at and dislike. I could imagine getting into it though if someone was really keen to play, and if AP wasn't making the game torture.

This is a great fast filler game, unless of course an A/Per won't realize that this is a kangaroo racing game.  This can turn into slow murky death with players that will over consider every permutation.  But, if you can play this with people that are interested in getting in a quick filler it will come highly recommended.

This is an abstract (racing) game where you have to set up checkers-like jumps to efficiently move your 'roos around the track. You jump over a single 'roo, as far on the other side as you started on this side (can't leave the board or jump into/over water). The first player to get all their 'roos around the track wins. 

I prefer a bit more theme. Still, it is kind of fun trying to figure out your best moves while avoiding setting up long chains of jumps for other players. That does tend to make turns drag sometimes, though.

[b]--- Rules Summary ---[/b]
The board is a grid of squares with the central area removed. There's a Start/Finish line. At the start of the game, players take turns placing their 5 tokens, one at a time, behind the start line.

On your turn, move one of your tokens (to empty squares only). Either:
- move one space in any direction
OR
- jump: place the black token at your starting location, then may make a series of jumps, each over ANY token in line with your piece. Legal jumps are over only ONE meeple, and you jump as far beyond them as you are in front of them (e.g., if there are 2 empty spaces between tokens in a line, you will jump to the 3rd spot beyond them in that line). You ARE allowed to jump over that black token. At the end of your move, the black token is removed. 
If you manage to move/jump past the Finish line, remove the token from the game. The first player to finish with all 5 meeples wins!

I tend to dislike puzzle games but found myself liking this for some reason. Probably because the puzzles are a bit more clever and have a lot of moving parts because of player interaction. This does open the door for AP, though, so just remember to steer clear of this with known offenders (who will win this, anyway).

Jumpin Roos!!  A groovy abstract racing game.  This is one of my favorite "filler" abstracts.  I think I just made that up.  Anyhow, a great deal can be added to game play by making sure you yell "BOING BOING" for every jump.

RATING: 7
Be the first to get your kangeroes over the finish. Move them by jumping over other kangeroes. 

You can jump as much as you want with 1 kangeroe but the distance of you jump has to be the same on both sides. 

If there are 3 squares between you and the next kangeroe, you will need to have the same amount after your jump. But that is not always possible.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This is really an abstract; any leapfrog-style theme would work fine.

It's what I would call a light brain-burner.  It can be a bit prone to AP, as it takes a while to go through every possible combination of jumps to figure out which one gets you the farthest.

The best abstracts have simple rules that lead to deeper strategies.  Billabong is easy to learn and teach, yet the tactical decisions elevate this abstract above most others.  Buy the 2002 Franjos version with wooden kangaroos and vinyl mat for the board.

GAME: Warhammer 40,000
RANK: 1915
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A classic Miniature play with decors and units moving using a tape measurer. Interesting, if somewhat depressing, lore that exist for decades...

-1 For painting required (no patience or talent)...
-1 For too much complexity of rules and play...
-2 Too many models that changes too often. Lots of discontinued... Also cost a fortune in minis and new codex...
-1 Too many rules changes and version codexes, it's hard to keep up to date...

RATING: 5
Was great in 3rd, worse in 4th, better in 5th, worse in 6th, and horrible in 7th edition.  7th Edition has pushed many out of the game.  I used to live for 40k, now I can say there are MANY better, cheaper, and more fun skirmish wargames out there.  Do your research before you invest several hundred or more to play this game.

Very good theme.  Miniatures are very cool.  Games are won by making the right army list and being smart deploying your units.  Games usually take a long time.  I used to play Dark Angels and Tyranids.  I enjoyed making buildings for cityfights.  A lot of the fun in Warhammer is using your own assembled and painted minis, and hanging out with friends; kind of like a nerd's version of a superbowl party.

RATING: 4
Outrageous geek-tastic gonzo-violent setting. Cool minis if you ever have the time to paint them. Players are given plenty of opprotunity to customize and personalize their army providing for a surprising amount of personal expression and emotional involvement.

But the [i]game[/i] is terrible. Freeform movement rules turn it more into performance art than a competition of wits. And the IGO/UGO has got to go.

See also Warhammer.

Most of the pleasure comes from collecting, painting and modelling. This makes it very expensive. The game is definitely unbalanced and decided mainly by your army calculations before your models even reach the table. But it is a hobby in itself, and an incredibly detailed and rich one.

Love the theme. Love the game. Hate the amount of time used just preparing your army. Hate the piles of cash spent just preparing your army.

Warhammer is one of those games that become more like a hobby than just a game for occasional playing. You can spend infernal amounts of time and money into building, painting, customising and showcasing your armies. The more you invest the more you love the game. 

As to the game itself, the juiciest lure is in choosing the right army for each battle. That is the moment when you lay the foundation for your basic strategy, and in principle the events on the table are just direct consequences of the pre-battle choices. Of course, you need to have eye for tactics since there is quite a bit of room for chance in the game (read, lot of dice rolling).

I find comparing Warhammer 40k and Fantasy Battle fruitless. It is just a matter of personal preference which theme you find more interesting.

I absolutely hate the constant rule revisions. I see no point in them other than forcing you to start building your army from scratch in tournaments etc.

RATING: 2
This edition has a lot of balance issues with assaulting being very powerful and the Eldar and Blood Angels being pretty much the only viable army choices if you plan on winning. 

There's also this weird rock/paper/scissors game regarding whether to take vehicles or not. You're mostly better off taking a few anti-tank weapons on infantry since if you take only one or two tanks they're going to die immediately. Transports are death traps, so it's not like you can just spam them to make up for screening or anything.

More a reaction to its players; when I wanted to join a group, their reactions were along the lines of "Go play something else, it's too complex for you."  Implied (but never outright said) that it's because I'm a girl that it's too complex for me.

Absolutely the best edition of WH40K ever made. If you don't agree, probably you're under 35 :) GW was a decent company by then. There was NO NEED to buy the codex, you could just organize ANY ARMY with those rules and spent exactly what you wanted (although miniatures were very expensive already).

GW, since WHFB 3rd, is compulsively changing rules to make you spend more and more. Just bought the 5th edition for the miniatures, as an expansion for my Marines and Ork forces. I have no intention to modify rules. According to most users, rulebook of the 2nd edition is absolutely the best. In addition, they allow you not to trash your old and beloved goff and gretchin troops. My rating of assault on Black Reach is much lower.

PD. This edition is the only one that allows you to play the best expansion for WH40K ever made: Dark Millennium (please see my comment on that).

I tried getting into this years ago, but just couldn't keep up.  A Games Workshop game isn't a game so much as a lifestyle choice.  To play it, you've got to dump a bunch of money in for models, then spend countless hours painting squads and flocking terrain, all while hoping that the next rules revision that comes along doesn't completely invalidate your army list.  Some people dig the hobby gaming thing, but it's just not my cup of tea...there's much more fun to be had elsewhere without all the overhead.

I like the background story and models very much but there are two things that keep me away from this game and lead me to Deadzone / Warpath and Dust 1947.

1.) That you activate all our models, before your opponent does. I prefer systems where you activate one of few models or groups and then your opponent does. It's more exciting.

2.) The price. It's very expensive compared to some other systems with miniatures of similar quality.

RATING: 7
Warhammer 40K lives more off it's theme and background than it's actual gameplay.  It's a quick, fun little game, but it's really geared towards a younger audience with it's simplicity and gameplay.

Still, it makes for a fun afternoon occasionally, so it still has a place in the home.

This gets a 2 solely on the hobby aspect of the game. W40k itself is a strategy-barren dice roll-off. While the figs are awesome, and you'll see some great dioramas on the field... a quick analysis of the rules (and lack of flanking, real morale, and insufficient cover rules) shows that this game is a glorified Yahtzee.

What I will give 40k above fantasy, is its fluff. 40k's universe is really quite cool. I've had wonderful experiences modding Dawn of War (once upon a time) to help with a Horus Heresy mod, and frankly find that storyline simply compelling. That said however, those storylines could be better expressed through other games (I have not tried the board game Horus Heresy, but would love to) as they would likely bring more strategy to the table.

Si se refiere a la Segunda Edición era un pedazo de juego. No sé si porque me pilló en mi adolescencia pero es que no le veía ningun fallo. Era mucho más táctico y estratégico que sus sucesores... Debo de estar equivocado porque todo el mundo dice lo contrario... seré yo...

Si se refiere a la tercera Edición pues la cosa cambia y mucho. Se cargaron los perfiles de movimiento, los retocaron a la baja. Se cargaron las tarjetas personalizadas de los vehiculos, la fase de magia, los combates cuerpo a cuerpo, la personalizacion de los persanajes cambiando todo el equipo... una puta mierda y con perdón; por eso y por romperme todas las ilusiones que tenía en este juego le metería un 3 pero en fin... todo sea por la nostalgia que puede que me ciegue mi racionalidad...

One of the best out there, and I can't wait to see how the new rules work.

The cost and time spent painting (not playing), make this seem more of a lifestyle choice than most other games.  While I like customizable games, I don't like the cost (in time and money) required to change forces.  Additionally, I'd prefer Warhammer over Warhammer 40K because hand-to-hand combat seems more thrilling, and I'd significantly prefer MageKnight over both of them.

Terribly slow and cumbersome battle game. After four hours of playtime, most units are still in the same positions. Here and there a single wound is scored but not much else happens. Incredibly boring game, that really only gets playable after spending hundreds upon hundreds of dollars on miniatures. Also, special characters are WAY too strong compared to normal foot soldiers, and you can have an unbalancingly high amount of those leaders in your army.

This game got worse and worse over time.  The Rogue Trader days was a lot of fun, because games were like creative train wrecks where the rules were so bizarre, and so free form that games took on narratives for us, rather than balanced wargames.  Will always hold a place in my heart.  Then the newer, more refined versions came out and it was all over for me.  Cool mini's though, and the development spawned Space Hulk and Epic, so it can't be all bad.

God awful expensive miniatures game that only wants to sell you more miniatures.  Terrible rules, suffers from archaic "you go, I go" problems.  First side moves and shoots and then whats left of the second side gets to lose.  Awful habit of GW never selling you the entire rules as they milk you for more and more money.  NO PLAYTESTING of the crap they add and no balance in anything NEW that comes along.  GW's idea of product design is a bunch of teen boys in a back room going "Yeah, that'll be cool!"  This is for the teen masses with tons of mommy and daddy money to spend.  You want a REAL tactical wargame, go get "Stargrunt II" from Ground Zero Games, it beats the pants off this crap.  Only reason it gets a 1 is because it does have neat stories in the books and pretty graphics.  I played this in the early 80's and it wasnt much good then, but it worked with the 10-15 miniatures per side that it was meant to be played with.  The rules havent changed much, but people play with 100+ minis perside and it turns into a rather moronic dice tossing contest.

See Warhammer Fantasy Battlles. However, WH40K appears to be the more popular and lucrative table-top miniatures game for Games Workshop. Unlike WFB, GW keeps coming up with bigger and weirder looking vehicles and alien menaces for your force to encounter.

There are better lifestyle games these days, if that's your thing.

Fun and hilarious tactical anecdotes aside, and they do abound, the games are often too unbalancd for real strategy to prevail.

When I owned a game store back in the mid 90's, I actually had a Games Workshop sales rep say to me "We don't really care if the rules are good or not.

The game isn't much better than this bloke's morals.

I have owned Rogue Trader, 2nd Edition, and 3rd Edition...that's where I stopped. As they geared the game more and more to "squads" (i.e. buy MORE models instead of less), I finally opened my eyes to the money-sink I always (secretly) knew this game is. I bought too many terminators with reaper autocannons, and spent too much time painting them, just to have them removed from the f-ing game. No mas. I'll stick with the games that stand alone and work: Blood Bowl (3rd edition) and Mordheim.

Have been playing since 1st edition (Rogue Trader) and this game gets better and better with each edition. 

40K is a fantastic set of rules for skirmish wargaiming in the horribly oppressive distant future. There is just the right amount of complexity to suit casual and hardcore players alike.

Only downside is that GW charge a fortune unnessecarily for their product. Expensive to start but soon you can add to your armies bit at a time.

I almost never played this due to the time investment required but I collected it and talked about it non-stop for about 3 years of my life.

Own a Imperial Guard army. Good game. But way too expensive and time consuming. Got bored because there were only two other people who would play. A bit too much luck and the first turn is too important if he map is not large. Only good if you have lots of time, lots of money and lots of friends willing to play.

RATING: 8
I great cinematic miniature wargame. Great models, interesting lore, incredible variety and customization. On the negative side, the rules are overly complex for what is only a medium-weight wargame, the game balance is quite poor, and the overall cost is exorbitant.

A major aspect of the game experience is the modeling. Your entire army is built from kit components, as is all the terrain. More than any other game, the army you make is uniquely yours - not only did you build it yourself, but the army building rules give you tremendous leeway to customize your army composition and equipment.

Ah 40K...the game I love to hate. Depending on my mood on any given day of the week, I love it or hate it. Somewhat comparable to illegal drug addiction. Doesn't seemed well balanced in the choice of factions, which is a bummer to finally realize that you have chosen a weaker faction long after you've spent way too much money and way too much time painting. Still I must rate it so high only because of the laughter and commraderie its has provided me while playing with close friend over the years.

I have been playing and painting too long to get out now. Simply said there are much better tactical wargames than this. Virtually anything hex and counter would do you well. Why not play Panzergrenadier or on lighter side Memoir '44? Theme and minis I guess.

Update 04/2011
In a tournament with some friends. It is great to get together and paint minis, but once you get past the hobby side of things the game is just so painfully one dimensional. No interesting scenarios, bland rule set, and way too long of a play time for a game of such little depth. Win or lose it is a bore.

Update: 09/15/2017 
With the advent of 8th edition new life has been breathed into this old beast. Good to see that GW has finally learnt that the game rules setdesperately needed an overhaul to drag it out of the 90's.

RATING: 5
Much better than WFB because of the more skirmish nature. Thus, less of the 'spend $500 to be competitive' BS prevalent in GW sh-ite. I didn%u2019t really play that many times though. I got on this band wagon as all my friends were getting out.

My first major investment into the world of gaming is now gone, Was never really happy with the 40k system since 3rd edition (biggest hate is the AP armour save system)
When 6th edition came out I realised I'd only played once since I bought 5th so It was time to get out.

Will miss my orks, especially the humour ridden orks from the days of 1st and 2nd editions.

RATING: 4
I understand the visceral appeal of a table full of painted figs, and there isn't much of an argument from me about the depth of atmosphere in this game. The problem is the game itself is dreadfully dull. A single six turn battle can take three hours to complete, and there isn't that many real decisions to make while at the table. Nine times out of ten you can pick the eventual winner as soon as the table is set up. The current ruleset (fifth edition, as of this being written) is so slanted to close combat tactics that it there isn't much point of trying to field anything else.

Players field an army of space-fantasy themed troops and/or beasts, and try to eliminate the opposing army in battle.  More a hobby than a game, you have to buy a rulebook, codex (special rules for your chaps), buy an army and paint it up, then trundle it into battle.  Fun game, awfully expensive to get into, but you'll always find opponents out there.  When played seriously in tournaments, you quickly learn millimetres are important.

RATING: 2
As if the miniatures aren't expensive enough, GW has to go changing the rules every 18 months. And they always still have issues. Last I checked they had revised vehicles five times since the first edition. I cut my (financial) losses a few years ago and stopped collecting/playing this one...

RATING: 3
First, I would like to say that as a hobby, there is some merit here.  There are many options for customization, painting, building battlefields, etc.  There is also a very rich story/background to delve into.

Unfortunately, all of those things seem to be far better than the game itself.  If you actually want to play the game, prepare for lots of rules variations that are always subject to change, about a hundred dice that might be rolled all at once, and very little depth in the way of real strategy and tactics.  There's just far too much dice rolling here and memorization of arbitrary values for units for my taste.  In fact, that's really all there is, just a fancy dress up party for a simple dice rolling fest.  Even moving units is determined by dice rolls (and the use of measuring tape).

This is not a cheap hobby/game to get into either.  If you want to collect and play competitively, prepare to spend a small fortune.  I have some relatives that seem to enjoy playing this game, but sometimes I wonder how much they actually enjoy it versus how much they simply want to enjoy it given the amount of time and money they've invested into it.  

Regardless of whether I just want to roll some dice or play a really deep game (or anything in between), I think there are hundreds of better, not to mention cheaper, choices out there.

The best hobby craft game (i.e. modeling and painting) and the king of all time sinks.   Very rich universe and you can easily spend more time reading about it, and modeling than you do playing.  And maybe that's okay.  The rules are very long, but they aren't as hard as people think they are.

Warhammer 40,000 can be very expensive to play. I played once with someone's else army. It was interesting, but nothing something I want to invest a whole lot of money in.

I enjoyed my experience Warhammer 40,000.

I would prefer playing Space Hulk than Warhammer 40,000. Warhammer 40, 000 is by the same game company as Space Hulk  but the game is WAY longer, although it is had to get since its OOP.

I have enjoyed my experience playing Warhammer 40,000. It's quite enjoyable for what it is.

Another game might change the game's rating.

RATING: 6
This used to rate a solid 8 when it was in its 2nd edition. Now in its 4th edition. Avoid 3rd edition as it was the worst of the bunch (4th is similar but it fixed some of the worst problem with 3rd). If you can find the 1st edition (aka "Rogue Trader") it's worth a try.

Still, great background for the most part.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Second edition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
To begin, I think the 40k universe is fascinating. I love the idea of a science fiction/fantasy universe where no one is really the good guy, technology and magic are practically indistinguishable, civilization is, despite being incredibly advanced, on a downward spiral toward destruction, and fear and ignorance rule the minds of all. That might show up better in games like Necromunda, but I still have that setting in mind whenever I play 40k. 

As for the rules, second edition was garbage. It was yet another case of "HeroHammer" in which one or two models would be really strong and the rest of your army would just tag along in order to fulfill the distribution of the points system. There was a lot of unbalance in the game between individual units and characters, but in general the armies were all close in ability. Everyone had one or two killer units and a bunch of junk to follow them around. I give that edition a 5. 

Third edition was a huge improvement. Units were far more balanced in relation to one another, characters and other special units were toned down a lot, and the army selection process was much more intuitive and coherent. I also liked the way they changed how armor is affected by weapons, how hang to hand combat works, and how various actions occur during the course of a turn. This was a real unit based skirmish game, where every unit counted and army selection felt like it actually mattered. 

Unfortunately power creep was a big issue in this edition. Every new army book that was released was more powerful than the one that came before it, and the more specialized armies were quite broken is you played to their strengths rather than for flavor. Some of the armies even had special rules that felt like they were designed to hose a specific unit or opposing army. Errata by way of regular release schedule? Maybe. I didn't like that part of the game. Still, it was a huge improvement over second edition in terms of balance and strategy. I give third edition a 7.

Well, the miniatures are AMAZING (some of the best in the market right now, if not the best) but the rules are terrible. The system is extremly boring and simple

They have not changed the core rule system since it was born (1993) so... what are we expecting for?

Played 3rd edition as a teenager and was obsessed for some years. With hindsight, as a game it was much too bloated, inbalanced and fiddly: inevitably each player would have a different interpretation of the rules, and games could often hinge on conditions open to interpretation e.g. whether X was in cover/LOS/range etc. Nowadays I've no interest in getting back into it (nor the wallet either, nor the patience for things like painting).

The 3rd edition was a massive attempt to simplify the game, but it comes at a cost.  Any sort of skirmish tactics became near useless, yet the huge armies seem far too tightly gathered for a battle on a tabletop.  It also changed some armies radically.

I stopped playing Warhammer 40k when 3rd edition came out.  My 4,000 point Tyranid army suddenly was unplayable because it didn't have enough of the right troops (I focused on the Longer ranged troops, in 4th ed. Tyranids are a melee army.)

I've always loved the space-roids setting this has. "In the grim darkness of the grim future, there is only grimness!" It's mostly the cost and collectible aspect of this that bother me! I bought this set as a poor youngin' and couldn't expect to compete against people with more elaborate armies. I even went so far as to make paper cut-out figures and homemade Eldar out of clay just to use against my friends. :)

Now, it seems as though I just couldn't devote myself to something like this. Buying and painting, buying and painting...and not playing. (Necromunda seemed to be the solution to this!)

When I was younger and had the time and energy to devote to this hobby, I really loved 40k.  The world is very detailed, and all the miniatures are very well done.

The second edition had major imbalance issues with my opinion, and had a difficult time integrating vehicles in essentially an infantry skirmish game.

Decent fun, but the time required to set up and play a standard game is crippling (4 hours plus).  Keep it down to 500 points per side on a 4'x4' board AND PLAY FAST with a bloated goat-load of house rules (like players alternating turns squad by squad) and it ain't a half bad way to spend 40 minutes.  But then I guess it isn't 40k anymore, is it?

And the game's not half bad as a "roll-all-the-dice-you-own-no-really" kind of game.  And I'm pretty sure I'm assaulting you this turn... if I'm not misjudging that gap.  [bites knuckle]

[imageid=257469 small]
UP-UPDATE:  8 --> 6  I'm at the point now where I'll actively avoid playing this... It's a fine-enough game, no doubt—everything I said in the preceding paragraph is still true—it's just that I've had my fill.  I've pored over the books, painstakingly painted the armies, handcrafted the terrain, and played the hell out of it with innumerable memorable games, burning through four editions (2nd-5th).  In the end it feels like a middle school crush, a soft spot in my heart that is far superior in concept than actual execution.  It was only ever going to go so far, and it did, and so I am done.

Yesterday I purged all my terrain; it was taking up valuable space in the garage while entropy nibbled away with its inexorable teeth, leaving dings, dents, and a slow snow of paint flakes and flocking...

As miniatures makers, very good. They have been the bests for a long time.

As a game, it's nearly broken. It's even expected to be nearly broken, this way they can re-write the game continually in order to sell more.

As a hobby, it's like a cult: every month they promise you a gaming paradise that never comes and little by little you lose all your money.

I know what I'm talking about. I had a 10,000 point Eldar army, I have been a W40K fanboi. No more. I have sold my minis and trashed the books. Avoid this game.

Combat system is much too complicated for one that bears no resemblance to real world physics. Space Hulk feels more realistic, with 1/10th of the rules. 40K's only saving grace is some of the figures it spawned (Tyranid and Tau).

This is the only miniatures style game I&#039;ve played and it&#039;s a lot of fun. The models are all great and the rules are pretty easy to follow after a bit of practice. It can be played straight up as a tactical strategy gaming or you can create your own characters and storylines for a more immersive game. If you&#039;re even considering getting into this, know that you&#039;ll be spending a small fortune building your army and just as much in time to paint and assemble them.

Ended up spending hundreds of dollars to get a decent-sized (2000+ point) Ork army to play at a local game store and give myself an excuse to paint a bunch of minis. The game is far from perfect (I was playing 5th edition), but still a lot of fun to play. There is a tremendous amount of strategy and tactics that can be employed, and takes a lot of commitment to get things going right. For a game of such complexity, though, it still runs fairly fast. I had a great time playing the games that I did, and am looking forward to playing again sometime.

This was the first minis game I ever played, back in 1987 (using the hardbound Rogue Trader rules).  Although I fiercely love the fluff universe and the quality of the figs, the prices are just way too high for what you get.  I stopped playing the game after the codex and rules updates kept destroying the value of the armies I already owned (not to mention times when I bought a model and found no stats existed for it).  So now I look on in amusement while other people blow thousands (yes, thousands) of bucks on huge armies to use with a rule system that discourages innovation and tactics.  It's all about the One Big Über-Character now, and the kid rich enough to afford that one piece will win.

The background is rich and darkly intriguing, but the rules are (by wargame standards) the absolute pits. Armies get caught in tactical ruts, addendums and errata ('clarifications') abound, and buying the expensive new figures wins it. Tactically bankrupt, overpriced, and gimmicky to the extreme. Nice figures and background, though.

This was great back in the day. Hilariously unbalanced characters and equipment (vortex grenades, anyone?) meant that if you didn't take it seriously, it was great fun. Ork weaponry I remember especially fondly - there's nothing quite like materialising snotlings inside space marines or destroying hive tyrants with killer bees. I have no inclination to play it nowadays though: there are shorter games I can play for that kind of silliness.

This rate is for the whole 40.000 collection
(I have version 2,3,4,5) including additional rules from V4 big book (which are more or less adapted from Necromunda missions..)
If not playing in competition your Giger Aliens, Heinlein starship troopers & bugs or XX-XXI centuries army (NATO, Warsaw Pact, Viet-Nam Special Force...) can easily be played as proxy, making W40K a generic system.

Why 8 for it and 3 for WFB ?
Well because I mostly play W40K as patrol.
with a total of 40 mini and 4 vehicules on table (sum for both player) and thank to different shooting range, annulation or armor save, scenery blocking line of sight,.. you rarely roll dice for everyone.
Not like in WFB when 2 units on 25 pikemen make their first clash. Surely shoot & assault of little squads are easier to handle than the charge of regiments.

But please avoid V3 and V5. Use V1 (Rogue Trader) with referee like an introduction to roleplaying, V2 for skirmish only and V4 for big battles.

This game is as good as the time/money you invest in it. A true oddity, as it is not merely a game, but a hobby unto itself.  My tyranids are a pride and joy of mine, but this game is too expensive and time consuming to be enjoyable by everyone. 

I withhold review score for that reason

I dig the fantasy settings more, and find the 40k rules overly cumbersome as well... so I like LOTR miniatures (also by Games Workshop) a bit more. But 40K is a good evening spent, especially if you like painting, or like spending lots of money, or can play with a friend's army :)

This game uses clunky, grainy mechanics (on a d6) where an entire army takes a turn before the other army gets to react.  In addition, the buying standards encourage big macho heroes over grunts.  If you want to play high fantasy spare opera where big heroes wipe out hordes of regulars play, play this game.  If you want a fairly-balanced game where players move alternately and regular guys can make a difference, buy something else.

This is for the Herohammer edition (2nd) which also fuels Necromunda.  For small unit games with a couple tanks and 3-5 infantry, this is a great, detailed game with excellent close combat, sustained fire and overwatch rules.   Yes, it became wargear craziness, but no one had made a game like this before.  I'm not a huge 40K fan compared to it's better cousin (WFB), but if I play, it's 2nd edition for sure.

I have a lot of blue space marine infantry units, many painted with metallic paints.  A space marine dreadnought and an old fashioned predator complete a small army that is mostly space marine infantry plasma-gun based.  I have many HQ and Elites, and a handful of terminators.  

Not all the figures are painted.  They have been in a box in the garage, so some may not even be in particularly good condition or may have become unglued.  This was an amateur army set that was never finished, and I would like it to go to another amateur rather than a collector -- someone who wants to get into a game and is looking for enough figures to both get started playing and to eventually build on.  

There's a bunch of old-style 2e unpainted orks, too, that came included in some kind of boxed set that we bought.  

I'd like to trade away the whole collection for a couple of good board games.

I quite liked the 3rd edition when using larger forces. The rules in the 1st Edition were more RPG like, with a GM detailed plots etc, the 2nd Edition was brilliant for skirmishes as it had very high details for all weapons, grenades and statistics and now this edition seemed to allow more simplified larger conflicts (though not on an Apocalypse scale). The only flaw with this edition of the rules was the assaults were a little hard to do, not the rules themselves but moving large units into close combat made things quite annoying. Still, an ok game and the first one to make a big change from past incarnations.

In a way, I wish I liked this. It's such a strong sub-hobby unto itself, and the world is so cool -- but it just doesn't work for me in practice.

Yeah it's "better", but I'd usually rather play Heroscape. I'd also rather put a down payment on a house than keep up with my army building. I would consider it a pinnacle of back story development though, and a long term campaign based on it is impressive. Really, it's a great game, I just don't have the drive to fully invest myself in it enough to get the most out of it.

This is the system of choice for my super serious mini-gaming friends who are far, far more invested in the system then I, so although I'd really like to try a couple of newer systems (AT-43/Ragnarok  and Hordes/Warmachine most of all), I doubt it will happen any time soon.

RATING: 7
I have enjoyed the initial version of the game, though the new editions leave something to be desired. I do not agree with units as a whole having to move or fire, they cannot do both, or mix them. The Space Marines are a good example, they are to be trained invdividuals, so when one portion moves foward the rest can provide covering fire.(Just like in reall military operations.) Overall I love the game, and have painted a good, at least I like to think, unit of Space Wolves back in the 90's.

I have bought a few box sets and individual Space Marine figures, mostly to use in customizing other games and as minis for modern-set roleplaying games. Haven't ever played the full Warhammer 40k game but I would like to watch a match some time.

I put for max players since I did play a game with 6 players and that was insane a two on two is ok but better one on one, Great game but I got tired of GW Marketing scam by changing the rules every bloody damn year so mostly we play with house rules if need be but are happy with one version of the rules. Minature are naturally a must to play this game which makes it more expensive and time consuming to play the game. The box comes with minatures so you can "play out of the box" but the urge to make your own army soon tugs at you in your sleep and your off buying new rule books and Models. If your going to get into this look at this as a long haul the basic game cost anywhere around 120 Bucks (canadian) but if your serrious look into investing over a thousand in the years to come. If you want to really get in the mood with this game I suggest to go dig up some old GW Novels (if you can call them that) since they give the universe a better feel (may not work with the "again" new system they made). Oh how I miss the Horus days.

It was a fun money pit. I like painting (ok attempting to paint) the mini's. The rules were a bit fiddly and the games could take a while to play out. Still a decent game though.

After playing battlelore I realized it scratches the same itch but with much less $ and hassle! I'm so impressed with that system and I would love to see battle lore : Future Fantasy at some point :)

Me and a buddy bought a starter set and split the cost. I painted all my figures in one evening and they looked awful. So bad I didn't really have the desire to learn the game.

I'm playing Warhammer 40k since the early 90ies and still love it. Aside from intense gaming it offers painting and terrain modeling and I love that, too. Of course it's not a cheap hobby, but you get some real nice models for your money and if you order at discounters in the net you can reduce the cost at least by one third.

Warhammer 40K bought me into gaming during my teens. If it wasn't for 40K, I wouldn't have Blood Bowl, Heroquest, Space Hulk or any other Games Workshop products. Although the game is pretty damn good, the time and resources which are required to model and play make this sadly a no-go game for me now!

As you might have seen from my images uploaded I used to be pretty into the game.  However the constant rules revisions and lack of players my age that aren't unbearable knocks it down pretty heavily.

I LOVED this game in high school.  Since then I have found games that take less time, have less rules lawyering, and are a lot more fun.  This game, though fun, is also a money pit.  It would get a much higher rating if GW would quit changing the rules, and make it cheaper to build armies (30-40 bucks a squad?! and you need lots of squads to play!)

After resisting the temptations of Games Workshop for the past thirteen years, I finally succumbed.  One month later: still painting but they're coming along.  I find myself purusing eBay for WH40K stuff and I spent $50 on the full-blown rulebook.  Now I'll need to dump a wad of cash on the Codex books for each army.  As the Talking Heads song goes: "My God, what have I done?"

Technically I don't own this game. But I've played it many times and have purchased so much GW crap (Minis, Codices, supplements, etc.) that they should give it to me. Plus the bastards obso-de-leted my main army. Should have given it a lower rating.

Some of the figures are great, particularly the earlier ones. Art and supporting fluff is good if rather dark and depressing.

It's quite fun if you don't mind learning a ton of rules. All too much work to play a game where most of your time is spent looking of special unit rules and exceptions to the rules and then cross-referencing against standard rules which have further exceptions.

Nuts to the old timers who had to make a day of their 2nd edition games.  THIS was the golden age of 40k gaming.  Too many add-on rules and unresolved issues corrupted it over time and led to it's ultimate downfall.

I played mostly the second edition, and gave up at the time of the third edition. Though I loved Rogue trader's bg, it has been streamlined to no end by GW...

Wonderful background material & great miniatures. The investment to just have a basic 1500 pt. force and the rules to play are mind-numbing.

Technically I wouldn't consider this game "perfect" but by the rating system's suggestions, it definitely rates 10.  I don't even think the rules are great, but I love the ability to build any kind of army I want.  It always keeps me coming back and I always want to try out my new army every time I finish building it.  It's way too expensive to buy all the models and I would advocate using proxies as much as possible, but I really enjoy playing.  Even though I don't think the rules are great, I think they work well to demonstrate who can build better armies.  I don't think it's entirely balanced either, but I think part of the fun is using fragile units finessefully to try to kill simple Chaos and/or Marine armies.

I can't fairly rate this, because it's two different games under one entry.

For some bizarre reason, the 2nd and 3rd editions share an entry, while the 1st, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th are all separate.

This is especially bad because the two are literally completely different games.

2nd Edition is good. 2nd edition with the Black Codex is as close as 40k ever came to perfection. 8/10

3rd Edition is arse. It is quite literally a reskinned WW2 game with a 40k skin hastily slapped on it to sell more models. 3/10

4th Edition is basically 3rd with a little bit of polish. If any editions should be combined into a single entry, it's 3&4. We don't need this rubbish being lumped in with 2nd.

A very tactile game compared to its little brother (Space Marine), but the actual figures would rather severely limit the army you could field (unless you bought and painted a lot more, of course).

Luckily a friend let me borrow some of his units.

The best version of 40K. The only version to win an award for it's rules. Characterful, still encouraged you to model and it you could still undividualise your characters well (important in a skirmish game). You didn't need to buy a massive amount of models to play unlike later editions.
I went back to play this edition a few years ago at a wargaming club. By the time we had finished everyone else at the club had come over at least once to see why we were laughing so much and having obviously so much more fun than people playing later editions.

By Games Workshop when they still had a fun about them instead of the kiddie focus they now support.

For me probably the slickest ruleset developed, without losing the detail of squad level mechanics. While it lacked the fully encompassing nature of first edition where you could field pretty much anything you could imagine, or the modern day army level games, it did speed up the game. Well, apart from the ludicrous amount of card and counters!!!! It did something great though, it allowed people to have two armies and scenery straight out the box setting up the GW model for decades to come. However, it also sparked their downfall (to my eyes) which was that miniatures gamers love their ability to create, be that armies or landscape. While the new stuff looks amazing it lacks the personality of the first edition irks and marines (can you see any smoking cigars hanging off a customised rhino now). I recently sold my copy of this as I needed the space and nobody else locally still plays it, but it still holds a place in my heart, after which the late nineties until late noughties saw me drift away from it. I know I was no longer the core demographic but I think it's a shame that GW forgot that they COULD be all things to all people having the ranges they used to. Anyway if you've never played it give it a shot, you never know but you may enjoy it!!!

RATING: 7
Miniatures game. Designed to milk you of money with new editions, codexes and miniatures released every month. Massively over priced but a fun game for older children, teenagers and intelligent adults with little else to do (Nerds).

Too complex for average Joe's to play and the need to buy new books and miniatures for it and then have to paint them take up far too much time if you have an active social life.

Wow, what a lousy game.
It once (up until '95 or so) was cool, but then they figured they could make lots of money by targeting mentally retarded teenagers with a love for technomusic. (Yes, they actually sold a technoCD as soundtrack to 40K. Anyone remember ,,Realm of chaos'' by ,,Boltthrower'' ? That was a cool soundtrack!) Oh well, I guess I'm just not dumb enough for this kind of thing. 100 Bucks for three brushes anyone? (No joke! They sell them online!)

I own a Sisters of Battle army and a Space Marines army.  I used to have an Ork army, too, but traded it to a guy just getting into the hobby.  Great fun, when you're playing someone who knows the game.  Very laborious when you're teaching it to a rookie.  A lot (really too many) rules to swallow...but once you've digested them all, a really satisfying game.

At least I played it. And... I played even some scenarios. Well. What can I say? I saw more better war games. Of course I understand fun of collecting you own armies and so you can controll randomness of the game... But it's not for me. I can play sporadically, but I don't want to buy all of these figures, etc.

A very expensive and unbalanced game, but lots of fun. There are cheaper, better miniatures games around now, but the popularity of 40K means you'll never be short of opponents. 

Some consider this game a dicefest, but there's less dicing than in your average block game, and it's really about managing expected value (e.g. if you need 4+ to wound and your opponent needs 4+ to save, mathematically you should commit at least four attacks, which may be the difference between moving-and-firing this turn or rapid-firing next turn). The randomness is really in the army lists...

Expect to make many of the pieces yourself by chopping up existing figures and scavening bits from other GW products -- if this scares you, you should avoid the game. The Citadel painting guides are excellent and should be mandatory for all mini painters.

If you're considering getting into 40K or a similar game, I'd say check out a block game instead, or if you're committed to painting minis, go for a low-density skirmish game like Necromunda. The advantage of 40K is its huge player base, but if your gaming group isn't already playing it, there are better minis games to get into now.

RATING: N/A
I've never played this, and what I've seen of it in play has never really appealed much to me. I've managed to pick up a bunch of marines, orks and terminators, and would probably be willing to play some low numbered skirmishes (6 to 12 pieces per side) to see if there's anything in this for me. I have definitely enjoyed painting the marines though. On the whole, I think that Space Hulk gives me everything that I would ever need from WH40k - the theme, the bits, and a chance to throw some dice and kill things. Real 40k looks a bit ponderous for my tastes.

This game is like the little girl of the poem... when it is bad it is very bad, but when it is good it is terrific. If you have the money and patience to build and paint an army and scenery, it looks spectacular (check out any GW store or read White Dwarf to see what I mean) but man, this game not only has thick rules (the new streamlined versions help this) but it is a HUGE money suck. A grand can easily be dropped on this game to build a worthwhile army. Rules have some hiccups (move or shoot should be changed to action points) but so much variety and those minis are awesome. Play this at the risk of your wallet and time.

Personally, I find the mechanics lacking in integrity, the source material lacking in imagination or authenticity, and the official models lacking in artistry or cost. Still, it is common currency.

I had previously rated this a 7.5, but in protest of GW's recent cease and desist letter to BGG, I am un-rating the game.  I was in the midst of painting my minis, and have suddenly lost all appetite to play the game, or any other official GW game.  Off to play their also-banned, fan-maintained, NetEpic.  If GW doesn't want to support their fans, I see no reason for BGG users to give them free advertising and product support.

*as a side-note, I have never before entered a "political" vote, and hope never to do so again.

If you've got four hours to kill I can seldom think of a better way to use it.  Yeah the armies aren't balanced, yeah the guy who spends more money on models usually wins, yeah you have to paint for weeks to make it look nice.  I don't care, it's a blast.  You get to roll dozens of six sided dice and destroy armies with the hailstorm of hot bolter fire that results.  If you don't have fun doing that you should take up another hobby.

This fantasy variant of WHFB suffers from the same syndrom. Maybe even more, the former diversity of the various races are almost nonexistant with the actual version.

bass ackward rules, rules changes every few months and an errata that could choke a sperm whale make this a game hardly playable without the use of special computer programs like army builder or devoting you life and money to studying the new rule books.

A fun skirmish game.  The 4th edition rules fixed my primary gripe; vehicles now have more teeth.  Otherwise, it is a fun game to play and the models look amazing.

The newest edition is streamlined, plays fast, and is plain fun (especially if you don't mind the massive quantity of dice used).

But if you think it looks cool and you like the wingnut setting, you can't go wrong picking up the starter boxed set.

I own scads of army books for this game and I love the back ground. Most of what I have is 2nd or 3rd edition stuff (probally useless now that 6th edition is out).

A great game if you have the time and money to invest.Usually easy to find someone to game with as well. Let the galaxy Burn!

eh...most of the fun is in the collection and painting, which I don't have time to do.

I only own the rulebook for background reading. I like to paint the miniatures, but I loathe the game mechanics. there&#039;s an awfull lot of detail, and it&#039;s all resolved with six sided dice, lots of six sided dice...

A little simpler than warhammer but still too expensive, too long to paint, and a new rulebook EVERY year. GW are penny pinching *people*.

Certainly a stepping point into boardgaming for me, but still...  Games Workshop are a bunch of money-grubbing corporates whose idea of rules is &quot;what makes us more money&quot;.  Couple the rules &#039;re-writes&#039; every few months with the fact that said rules invariably require the purchase of more kit than supplied initially, and you have a lucrative con.
Decent for miniatures hobby, mind - just a bad game.

I don't like the sculpting style of overly large headgear.  Don't like the layer after layer of rules either.

Looking for 5th Edition stuff only. Primarily the new Space Wolves stuff and/or Tau Codex and figures.  Also looking for Space Marine or Tau vehicles, too.  :)

Fun, but rules, rules, rules, rules, and did i mention rules.

While the rules have issues, it does play well, and I think we forget just how abysmal 2nd ed was.

I got into this after Warhammer Fantasy and didn't play quite as many games. I always preferred the Old World over the uber-macho 40K universe. 

I collected Dark Angels, Blood Angels, Dark Eldar, Eldar, Imperial Guard and Chaos but my Blood Angels were the only ones I actually finished painting. Dug it out and sold it all on ebay back in the mid 2000s, probably to fund a MtG habit.

I liked the tactical skirmish aspect of it. I played a self-made game similar to this before. But in the end, too much investment, as always with GW.

Si no te lo tomas sólo como un juego, sino como un hobby... es una buena idea.

RATING: 5
A pretty fun game, but I much prefer the greater planning necessary to be good at Warhammer Fantasy.  The incredible mobility and arc of fire of most troops makes it too easy to compensate for poor tactics for my tastes.  

My Space Orks, Dark Eldar and Space Marines have all been eBayed away.

RATING: 7
Good game, but I'm lazy to paint the models and to collect good enough army to prevail is too expensive for my wallet. So I stay in skirmish games.

This is a grea game. I play Tyranids & Necrons. It is a fun way to waste some time. The only downside is the cost. It is way too much to buy an army so i recommend online retailers like DoorDice,com that always have the componets for 20%, sometimes more. Otherwise play Advanced Hero Quest. It's a lot cheaper and plays almost the same.

This is a fun game to play with, despite being very fiddly. At this level of detail, I think I would prefer a videogame to a boardgame. The level of customization available is unmatched in digital gaming, however.

Difficult to rate, as a game it's not bad but not amazing, but it's so much more.

4th edition (and now 5th) improves upon 3rd in every way. The game was fun at the time, but there's no reason to go back.

I own this, but I'm not listing each edition separately for simplicity's sake.

Great if you are a grognad with lots of money and painting skill.

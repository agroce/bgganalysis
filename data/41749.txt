You know this cheap pizza that you can buy at the average discounter supermarket that costs basically nothing and tastes like ... well, the reminiscent idea of the good stuff that you get at Giovanni's round the corner? 

American Rails is a bit like that. Not that it has cheap material or an ugly design. Both graphics and material are fine. It is even fun to play. Its just that ... its a bit of the rush you feel when playing Chicago Express, it's a bit of the mind-boggling complexity of 18xx, it's a bit of the crazy interaction of well ... every bidding-game ever. 

But then again, it's just a weird mixture of too-much-of-everything, and you could simply play the real thing and be done with it.

1st play: Clearly inspired by Chicago express, this one adds a variable turn order, more choices for where to establish train lines and cities that reward monopolies.  It increases the weight of the experience, and also the duration.  Part of what I love about Chicago express is the playtime, and I don't know that the extra complexity is worth the effort.  The experience isn't as smooth and the board/components are quite a bit less attractive.

2nd play: This time, played with my regular group who are a little more engaged when it's not their turn.  As a result the game played a lot quicker and that made the experience better.  It shares many of the same things I like about CE, but with a variable turn order and more flexibility over routes.  Blocking off routes and capitalization actions both become a bit more important, and the minimum bid amount seems less amazing in the late game, but this time, because we played until the bits ran out, we didn't have a bunch of auctions that everyone passed on.  CE still edges it out, but this is still good.

Oh my, a Chicago Express variant that improves on the original.  The "player-controlled variable turn order" is something more to think about.  The player choice of company start locations adds variation and there isn't the same Chicago or bust feel.  The reduction in city income when a second railway connects to it is another clever element.  Overall, a very good game indeed.

Production quality of the Quined edition is pretty good, with a mounted board and money on thicker paper than you sometimes find.  The rules are well written and appear complete.

A lot like Chicago Express but with more freedom and a very nice turn order mechanic. Catering for 3 players I’d chose Chicago Express. For 5 players though it would be American Rails. With more blatant strategy than Chicago Express, comes a little more play time. My first game took 2 hours with 5 players. I can see that dropping a little with experience. This is an excellent game going straight into my top 10.

- For its small print it's a great production, but it certainly deserves a big publisher's attention.

RATING: 8
Similar to Chicago Express, but I find it a much better and balanced game. The connection between action and play order works really well, and there's more freedom in where to build track. But in my opinion it shares the same endgame problem of Chicago Express: since shares have no value and don't count for the final net worth, it tends to be very arithmetical because you need to estimate how much you can spend on a share auction and still come out ahead.

Still it plays fast, and unless you really want to do all the maths to squeeze as much as you can from auctions, it's not too heavy.

RATING: 3
I actually played this yesterday from a friend, so i don't own it. However, i don't want to. I found it terribly boring and arid... you makes some bids on railway stocks, owning different companies, then the company, through you (or vice versa actually), buys tracks to connect cities in the us. However, different players can own the same company, thus splitting dividends and making a somewhat cooperative gameplay. The problem is you can get cornered easily and fall behind fast. There is a very nice mechanic that is you spend an action to buy tracks, but the money must come from company funds, which can be received by injecting it as an action or by auctioning more stocks. Nonetheless it's pretty lousy and seems like they just glued the theme badly, but it is still an economical and corporation game.

After two plays -- In the "Chicago Express" vein, but an more to my tastes. And I hope that the game will not start to feel 'samey' after 10 plays. Different openings (while still wholly deterministic) and a novel turn order/action selection mechanism should help. Still a subtle system.

Update -- The desire to play this faded pretty fast.

First play, I messed out the game due to getting some rules wrong... so I can't evaluate the game yet...

I'm sorry for my partners, we played to another thing due to my misinterpretation of the rules.

*update*

After playing this two times without mistakes with 4 and 5 players, this game is very good. I want to play it a lot to find a way of optimize my decisions. 

Very good train system, different from the AoS and 18XX train game families.

*update*

It's a pity that my game group don't like this game because I really love it. That's the reason why I finished trading it away: my unability to take it to the table.

Preliminary rating of 8.  This needs a few more plays to decide if it's good enough to keep.  It's like CE but the temporary alliances feel weaker.  That said, the turn order mechanic is brilliant and AR does remove the singular race to Chicago while increasing the replayability by allowing companies to start anywhere.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Too derivative of CE. If this were just a patch or $10 expansion,
fine, but at Winsome like prices, it's ridiculous to
put out something like this.

RATING: 6
Many people looking at this game have probably already played Chicago Express, as the two games share a lot of similarities.  However, a lot of tweaking was done to make American Rails seem somewhat significantly more replayable.  I won't go into the differences as there is already a great review on the subject, but I really like the changes here.

However, the main thing that mars an otherwise very good game for me is the end game, which can easily boil down to a king making situation.  The end game also becomes weirdly calculational, as players can easily see what a share is actually worth near the end.  If not for this, the rating would be a clear 8 or 9.

Overall, still a good stock holding game with tough decisions on board positioning, timing, and who to partner with and when.  Too bad that the end game sours it a bit, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
We were all new to this game, so we probably made a lot of mistakes (not rule-wise, but in terms of decisions…). In our game the player who won was the player who actually got his “own” company up and running almost all by himself. He splashed a lot of cash into the company and didn’t do much else. That did seem a little weird as I had expected that you needed to cooperate much more and that you would need to buy and sell stocks all the time. Again, maybe it was just us, but he did win fairly convincingly, so…
The turnorder mechanic where you go first based on how high on the track the action you selected the previously round is, is pretty good. You are forced to make some tough decisions; do you want good actions now or do you take some worse actions but then go before other players in the turn order (which can be crucial).

I think it was maybe a little weird when you offer a stock; for instance, there were to stocks in a green and a blue company, and I chose to offer (and eventually win) the blue company, which meant that the player in the blue company got fewer points throughout the game because the revenue now had to be split, whereas the player in the green company got all the points for himselv. Yes, I know that the money I put into the blue company could then be spent on laying rails and improve the company, but it still felt a little weird to me that you could sort of choose who to punish. Maybe it will change in my next play – I’m sure I’m going to try it again, and I’m also more hooked on getting my own Chicago Express to the table. Still, American Rails didn’t chance my mind on train games in general: I’m just not that into them.

I love Chicago Express.  American Rails takes it and makes it go a little further and better.  It also neatly balances the different Chicago Express dials so that one dial doesn't always run out first.

RATING: 7
First impression: obviously very similar to Chicago Express, no real need to not compare the two directly. First game was four newcomers at the table. The opening phase of the game is delightful and full of possibilities, but the game got slightly but noticeably draggy near the end. Felt like it was difficult if not impossible to pull out of being in a bad situation, and the game is longer than CE.

Still in all, it's quite a bit better than mere adequacy, certainly worth a re-visit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Cool and a little odd.  Weirdly like the most recent wave of Winsome titles--that is, a clean Winsome frame with some weird cadences more properly suited to eurogames.  Namely the way turn order is played out.  Still, it's fun, and the little turn order dance is at least as interesting as Wallace's Steam.  

Gifted to my brother for Christmas 2012.

(Hypothetically interesting, but I want to read reviews and likely play it before I think about picking it up. I've already started unloading the HRS games that I don't care for as much, and this is definitely in that family, but without the Winsome development behind it.)

RATING: 6
I was never one for its spiritual predecessor Chicago Express, not because I didn't recognise its qualities; more that I had trouble bending the game to suit my needs... which is difficult and requires skill and training. By the time I was finally able to formulate a few un-dumb rules of thumb, American Rails entered the scene, and was promptly picked up my gaming friends as 'a good game'. Recognising the heritage I tried applying the same heuristics, and was pleasantly surprised to find out they 'worked' at this low skill level. Although the games are obviously different, at my pitiful level they are readily interchangable to the point of awarding both the same rate.

I am hard pressed to decide which one would be 'better' at this point in time. There is more freedom on the map, true, but development has been curtailed; the ideal number of players has increased to a number I have trouble filling; there are actions which only make sense under certain conditions (as opposed to the one size fits all-approach of CE); I dislike the artwork; etcetera. Apparently there are qualities to Chicago Express I hadn't realised before... and that doesn't even take into account that I've never played Chicago Express' expansion which is rumoured to deal with a few patterns which tend to crop up in my games every time.

All in all the rate can still shift, and it will if the game gets replayed... and that is somewhat of a rub, as it currently doesn't, in fact has been sitting on a shelf after my friends had purchased it. Shame, really.

This game derives heavily from Chicago Express. But it removes some of things that I dislike about Chicago Express and add some things that I really like.

- The turn order is variable, depends on your previous action.
- Starting city of each company is variable, making more replayability options
- Putting the income only at city making it more sense than Chicago Express. No more raising income with spreading to mountain without reaching the cities.

Overall feel, the game is more calculating and evaluation. This is where experienced players will usually have better decision than the less experienced. It's sign of a good game.

The new best version of Chicago express/Wabash
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Players are investors in American railway companies in the 1850's.  A very simple game, mechanically.  Players choose an action and either utilise it, or pass on it.  Actions include auctioning a share in one of six railroads; expanding a railroad; injecting capital into a railroad; developing cities on a railroad, and so on.  An elegant tweak on the action selection, is you are also selecting your position in the turn order for the next time you act, and of course the powerful actions (auction, large expansion) mean you go later next turn.  Every three action rounds, dividends are paid out based on railroad expansion to share holders, and most cash after seven turns (seven payouts over 21 rounds) wins the game.  Very much from the Chicago Express stable, this one improves on it in so many ways - less scripted, more tactically rich, the turn order/action mechanism is excellent, and amazingly the game is much easier to teach to new players.  Loved it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very cool twist on Chicago Express, but with perhaps a more interesting version of a similar map. the main difference is in the way the action selection works. It makes for a more even game, without the problem of over-action that can happen in certain groups.

Is it worth owning both this and Chicago Express? Maybe, ut I'm glad I have both.

This is a really solid train game and strikes the right balance for me between economics, track development, and some gamey factors like turn order and action blocking.  It's very much like an advanced version of Chicago Express.   Which is the only complaint I have against it, because C.E. scratches the same itch.   Production here is just a hair better than Winsome, but if you're into these kind of games you probably don't demand high production values for this type of game anyway.   I much prefer this style of rail game to the dry and process-oriented Age of Steam family of games.   Good game, but I don't need to own it.

2014-05-06 : We played half a game of it at Spiel and I liked it enough to finally get around to acquiring it. It got put on the table last night and it was a very fun and tight game. I especially liked the very elegant way the board layout handled player order and what options are available to each player.

Given all that it would have qualified for an 8-rating if it weren't for a number of minor, but somewhat annoying problems :

1) It's that "shared victory" crap again. And - of course - it happened on our very first game that 2 players had the same amount of money (=victory points). Is it really that difficult to put something like : "In case of a tie, the player with the most shares wins, second tie-breaker is highest final position on the action selection chart" in the rules ?
I truly dislike this sort of sloppy game-design.

2) The player cards have a game end condition misprint that's a real boo-boo. There's a pdf here which fixes this, but that's an oversight that shouldn't have happened.

3) The Quined edition comes with little houses to represent developments, but the board layout still has them as cubes, which is a bit unfortunate.  The rules regarding developments could have been a little bit clearer as well.

RATING: 7
Being a good fan of Chicago Express I thought it would be interesting to play American Rails for a bit of comparison.  Obviously, there is much in common between the two games.  I like the additional freedom that one has in American Rails and the additional available actions as well is refreshing.  It is also easier to explain to new players as CE has a couple of funky things going on which don't make a lot of sense until they start happening in the game.  That being said, I like that CE plays in half the time as I felt AR was beginning to feel long-ish by the last few rounds.  As neither game has much of a catch-up mechanism, AR especially dings new players vs. experienced as it can become quite apparent after the half-way mark who is going to win.  But overall if you don't have either game I think either would work for your collection as the sweetest thing about both is the stock system where money goes to - and is spent from - the railways instead of the player.  It's a brilliant idea that is done equally well in both games.  It just depends whether you want a freer, but longer experience or a shorter, but more tightly scripted one.

Variable setup, income reduction in shared cities, and the action selection mechanism are the linchpins in this fine Wabash derivative. Incentives are much looser when compared to Wabash, but timing the endgame is every bit as crucial. Can run a bit long, if it goes to the very last year.

The core of this is an auction game, wrapped with the railroad investment and construction to generate the valuations upon which to decide how much to bid in the auction.

This Historic Railways spinoff compares very favourably with the best Winsome products.  It comes in a similar flat pack, the map is stiffened color paper with nicer artwork than many Winsome games, the stock and player cards are custom printed color and also very nice, the cubes are almost identical in size and feel.

It also recognizes Wabash Cannonball (WC) as an obvious predecessor, but it has some other nice twists in gameplay which help to differentiate it.

First, unlike the counted actions in WC which trigger payouts, American Rails (AR) has a set maximum number of years and rounds- every three rounds ends a year and triggers a payout, which means fewer gamey non-action choices and a more regular income.

Second, the actions chosen determine next round order, which has a very AoS feel to it, without the additional time added for an auction.

Third, the larger map adds a number more historic cities, and that necessitates an additional railroad to use the added space. Also, unlike WC, Detroit is not used as a game-end timer, it is reached and developed like any other city.

Based on a 1st 4-player solo play, I think the play tension isn't quite as heightened as WC's, but it adds a nice historic feel (despite the non-historic railroad names) and gives some added control to game flow (removes some of the potentially chaotic thigs one can do in WC).

I'm starting this at a 7 for now, but this definitely was a nice extension of a wonderful series of simple but challenging railroad games.

The action selection really is just super great.  After a few plays, the boardplay doesn't seem to have degraded into boring routes.  I love the number of companies in the game too; you really have to pay attention and diversify your shares geographically as well.

The last play turned painful.  All players realized the last couple rounds were calculable, so the auctions ground to a halt.  Especially since scores were only a couple bucks apart.

I have some variant ideas, but haven't fleshed them out.

I love this family of games (American Rails, Chicago Express, German Railways, and to a much lesser extent, Paris Connection). The cool part is how often alliances form and then dissolve, such that you're happy to build up a rail line with another player right up until he or she either overtakes you in shares in that company or otherwise looks to be winning. 

One downside: Like Chicago Express, this gets a bit mathy and slow toward the end. You may know you're out of contention 3/4 the way through and just have to ride it out. But high-skill, low-lick games are like that.

I really liked the mechanics - my first impression is that I like it better than Chicago Express (a game I really enjoy).  I enjoyed the way companies could start in any city, and I enjoyed the action mechanic going from left to right.

Traded in Jan 2013 Math Trade.  Wasn't getting enough plays to justify holding.

Juego de trenes centrado en la compra de acciones de las diferentes compañías.

Se trata de un pequeña maravilla en la que iremos desarrollando una serie de compañías con diferentes números de trenes y acciones. En cada año tendremos tres rondas de acciones en las cuales elegiremos principalmente entre expandir una compañía, intentando que suba su valor, y sacar a subasta una acción de una compañía. Al final del año se cobra en función de las acciones que tenemos, las cuales valdrán en función de lo que se haya extendido la compañía

After getting a fair share of plays within a year from its release, I haven't played Chicago Express anymore in the years since. Along comes American Rails which feels like a refined version of it and which is at least as good as the original if my memory doesn't betray me.
The key change is the fixed structure of three player actions per year before a dividend is paid out. The player order depends on the kind of action they have taken in the previous round. The more powerful, the later they go. Another change increasing replay value is the free choice where to start a railroad once the first share is sold. No set piece as Chicago Express was.
A train gamer won't ask if he needs this when he has Chicago Express, Kansas Pacific or any other cube rail game. Everybody else should give it a try if he doesn't own CE.

Our first game was marred by user error. But even though I now know what we did wrong (bidding too high for shares the first round, letting a player scoop up a bunch of shares for cheap in the next round), the game is just too long. I realize that the whole purpose of the game is to tweak Wabash Cannonball/Chicago Express a bit. But I see no reason to play this over its predecessor. The components are better in the original. The play time is shorter and the decisions are very similar.

Conservative rating; hope for and expect it to go up with more plays, with a review to follow. Currently concerned that there are too few actions between dividends to shake things up: auctioning shares hardly seems justified if you can just expand your companies and hope for an undiluted income base. Only played with three, which is said to be suboptimal, though I liked it well enough.

A reworking of Chicago Express. Takes many of its good mechanics and adds enough to make it a great game of its own. It does tend to lengthen play time a bit, but the ability to impact share price of a company you do not own, impact turn order based on which action you pick and expand more than one company you own with an action are some of the cleaver tweaks that make this a very enjoyable game. Components are all very good quality for a self produced game. The Red company can be very powerful and is often undervalued in the first game (or two). Have played with 3, 4 & 5 with 4 being my preference so far. I look forward to more plays.

Enjoyed this one but I prefer Wabash Cannonball (Chicago Express).

Otherwise, the games feel very similar.

RATING: 8
Good, old-fashioned railroad stock game, but stripped down to its essence (some of the companies have only two or three shares, for example). Super easy to learn, engaging all the way through, and tense. The word "elegant" gets thrown around here a lot, but this is a really lovely design with no extra fluff. Suffers a little from a highly calculable last round, but not a huge deal. Three players is not optimal, but works. Probably best with four. And this could easily be expanded with different maps a la Steam.

Except that this one is better and more challenging.  Tim did it with this design and I thoroughly enjoyed the game.  It's quick, easy to grasp yet there are many many strategy involved.

A train game that really hit it right for me.  I Had to go out and preorder the  final printing of the game.  Has all that Chicago Express did not deliver for me.  Love the fact the trains can start anywhere: allows some real variety.  Finished within the 90 minutes.  Great layout makes it easy to see who is up next and what your options are.

June '17:  great four player game in which I limped in third.  The auctions are nerve  wracking and I am not good at them.  I did not get enough shares overall, and unless players collude, tough to catch a leader, but it is such a nice open game, with the chancw to start anywhere on the board, and plays so quickly this does not bother me too much.

Wow. This really does take [gameid=31730] and notches it up. Particularly with a simultaneous action selection / turn-order mechanism. Plenty of decisions to make and an interesting map full of plenty of opportunity to score points for your investments and while blocking out others.

The mechanics of this game are an improvement over Wabash Canonball and Chicago Express as the minimum bid is $10 which stops the purchase of shares at silly low prices. Also the ability to fund a company with $5 as an action helps to keep underfunded companies in the running.
The real issue for me is the runtime of the game which with 5 players went on for  nearly 2.5 hours! I do not think that this would redcude much with frequent plays as there are so many actions per player per game. At this length the game takes far far too much time for what it delivers in gaming experience which is a shame. Maybe 3 players is its sweet spot?
Update: after second play with 4 players, 105 minutes. The game felt a lot faster, but I still feel that for the depth of game the runtime has to get much closer to 75 minutes to equate with the gaming experience.

American Rails is Chicago Express with a couple of improvements. Chicago Express was big simplification of the 1800 game series. It involves buying (not selling) shares of railroad companies and developping them. The best improvement American Rails adds is the action chart, that allows players to choose better actions while sacrificing their order of play (they will later be forced to worse actions). IMO, it also encourages negotiation.

The game changes a lot whenever people buy shares. You only have so much control about everything and even if you read the situation very well, all it takes for things to go the wrong way is some people choosing differently than you thought they will. Then is when you will have to strike some deal with the rest of the players and try to catch up with the leader. You have to be careful though. Even if things change fast, you can find yourself out of the victory race quite soon if you commit important mistakes in the early steps.

Gioco molto bello perché riesce ad offrire, con meccaniche semplici e durata contenuta, un ferroviario con fase azionaria non banale ma profondo e strategico. Gioco perfetto per gli amanti di 1830 che però non hanno tutto quel tempo a disposizione. Gioco che preferisco di gran lunga al più quotato Chicago Express e che in certi versi mi ricorda Imperial (per la scalata verso il controllo delle azioni), le compagnie hanno tutte caratteristiche differenti: numero di azioni e numero di binari costruibili. Promosso a pieni voti.

Although it has a lot of similarities to Chicago Express there is enough here to actually have both. As with Chicago Express you buy shares of train companies and can build out track for any one you have a share in with the purpose of increasing its share value. However as you cross paths with other trains you can effect their prices (negatively). You also each get the same number of actions before each payout (3) and no one can select the same action as another in each round. First game went a little longer then I felt it should, but sped up on a second play. Well worth a try.

a wabash cannonball/chicago express variant with excellent components quality.

it has two new ideas:
1. you can start a RR in any city
2. there is a zero-sum mechanic between RRs: you can build one RR into another RR's cities, simultaneously increasing one's income and reducing the other's. this is what makes the game.

also, the action choice chart, while not really a new idea, is a worthwhile development.  all summed, this is a well done game. if the game was a little smaller, shorter, and tighter it would be a 9 or a 10.

RATING: 8
An excellent derivative of the Historic Railroads system.  I was extremely impressed with how balanced the various railroads were despite their differing pros and cons.  

The ability to choose the starting cities of each railroad and forcing players to balance their actions this turn with the next action round's turn order really make this game standout by putting much more control in the players hands.

Having only played one three player game, the actions felt a bit loose.  Particularly the fact that we were guaranteed one of the Expand actions each turn if needed.  However, I don't see that as a criticism because everyone is aware of it and can (should) plan accordingly.  

I'd like to play more before running my mouth too much more, but I can see this rating increasing with further plays. :)

RATING: 8
This game is not substantially different from Chicago Express and Paris Connection, but it does have the potential to go on longer than it's cousins. It's been just long enough since I played the other two games that I don't feel comfortable writing up a list of differences between the games, but from our one play it felt like the thing that makes this game really interesting and different is that you don't know quite when the end of the game will trigger, which makes your mental math about what stocks are worth difficult, since stocks pay out at the end of each round. I enjoyed the game quite a bit, but I've liked most train games I've played. One of my friends who likes Paris Connection because it's short, and likes 1846 because it's more about stocks than logistics for him, disliked this game a lot. He felt the game relies too much on players knowing what their own best interests are and then acting on them in order for the game to be stable and avoid a runaway leader. In fact, in our game, despite other players having the opportunity to stop me, I was able to buy both copies of the stock in the red company, which seemed like a fairly chumpy move since Red wasn't a large or impressive company, however, players had more or less left it alone all game, and since I was getting 100% of it's payout, this small company amounted to more money coming to me than other players were getting for their 30-50% of larger companies.

The sad part is I picked up Chicago Express and American Rails because of this friend's liking of Paris Connection, thinking this would be a way I could play train games with him, since he also doesn't like Steam or Railways of the World. Now I have a whole new branch of the train game genre I won't be able to get to the table.

Another train game with hexes and buying of shares, the weird thing being if only one share of the company has been issued then the owner gets all of the income it generates (and not proportionate to the total shares). And then if someone decides to float your company share, you have no incentive to invest in it as it doesn't increase your income but if someone else takes it, you split the income. Weird!

Chicago Express is better. American Rails is about 30-45 minutes too long for the challenge it offers.

The worker-placement-esque mechanism that also determines turn order makes this game feel like yet another soulless Euro. I think this mechanic balances the game too much as dividend payouts come in regularly, and the kinds of actions taken are too evenly distributed.

In my last (and only) game, I knowingly overpaid for a share (which cost me the game) partly because I was bored of passing so often during the share auctions.

There are definitely similarities to Chicago Express. I think both games are great games. Chicago Express is leaner and plays in 30 minutes, while this can take 60-90 minutes. But with that extra time, the game is a lot easier to understand compared to CE's opaque gameplay. I think if you want a more competitive game, go for Chicago. If you have people of different skill levels, this one is better. If you don't like investing and making money, this isn't your game.

First play (3P) was tense and enjoyable.  We all enjoyed the action phase and its effect on turn order, though with three players and 3 expand options, it was rather natural for all the railways to expand aggressively to start.  Game ended due to lack of supplies after 4 turns with scores relatively close to each other.  Great fun, fast playing, and can't wait to try again.

--Aug2010-- Delightful mutation of the Wabash Cannonball/Texas & Pacific system.  I found the action selection system entertaining, and enjoyed the modest negative interactions of the train companies as they built into one another.  Very happy to play again.

Nice Wabash Cannonball variant with a pleasant action selection twist.  As is the problem with all games of this type, there are not enough players and time to play them all as much as they deserve.

Antes de American Rails, había disfrutado mucho de una partida de Chicago Express. Después, me pareció que American Rails era superior.

Las reglas son extremadamente sencillas, pero No lo recomiendo para no jugones por dos razones. La primera es que tiene una profundidad estratégica bastante grande, y la segunda es que, entre jugadores con diferente nivel, las primeras pujas pueden ser muy definitorias del resultado final del juego, esto es, alguien puede quedar muy atrás en la primera puja si se permite que alguien se lleve una acción muy barata, o al contrario, que se puje demasiado por una acción. El típico dilema de los juegos de subastas: ¿cuánto cuesta esto?

La interacción es continua y el puteo se presenta tanto indirecta como directamenteen forma de pujas por acciones y bloqueos. La diferencia con el Chicago Express es que en cada partida cada compañía se fundará en una ciudad diferente a elección del primer inversor, lo cual dota al título de una rejugabilidad más elevada.

Nuestra partida fue a 4 jugadores y, si bien a 5 jugadores debe ser más divertido aún, a 3 jugadores no recomiendo jugarlo.

Un buen juego

Played 1 4P game. I'm generally ambivalent towards auction and shareholding mechanisms, but I did enjoy this game. Although I have yet to try Chicago Express, this reminds me of Airlines Europe on steroids. Almost all game aspects - from turn order to the acquisition of stocks - are controlled by players, making this game highly strategic. Auctions are an exercise in cost benefit analysis, as players have to weigh whether the amount they are paying for the stock can be recouped over the length of the game. The only thing which is a bit of a downside is the last turn can really grind by as it's all about optimising your score.

[b]Official Rule Changes[/b]

a) In the SETTING UP section, add the following sentence after the second paragraph (which ends with "Do the same for each of the other five companies."):

--------
If there are three players, randomly choose one company and remove it from the game. Place all of its shares and cubes back in the box.
--------

b) Change the starting cash section to read $50 for 3 players (instead of $65).

c) Change the EXPAND 2 OR TAKE $2 section to read:

--------
TAKE $2 or EXPAND 2

The player takes $2 from the bank and adds it to his personal holdings, or takes $2 from each other player and returns it to the bank.

Alternatively, in a four or five player game, the player may take an Expand 2 action instead (see Expand).
--------

The Expand 2 option is now only available in 4 or 5 player games.

NOTE: Did you notice the new option for Take $2? Now, instead of taking $2 for yourself, you can instead make all the other players pay $2 to the bank. This makes the Take $2 option more powerful, as it could put players below the $10 minimum amount needed to purchase a share (particularly early in the game). And since the Take $2 action comes before the Auction action, it could be particularly nasty to someone who took the Auction action with the intent of buying a share for himself.

A train game based on its predecessure Wabash Cannonball. Starting with the art work and the components although this is not an euro kind of game example to anything (it's basicaly a professional home made production) they´re quiet good and well designed. Wooden cubes, good stock certificates and a beautiful map. Not a board but a good map.

It gives the same feeling to play (strategically I mean) than Wabash but in fact I find them both quiet different.
I like this one much better because the action selection is very clever and the way the game can easily change its destiny is more obvious. I mean, there's a lot more options to win in a more simple (apparently) game.

One of the best of 2009 maybe but I need to play it again and with more players to confirm this statement.

Very much in the vein of Chicago Express, and just about as good, but not as tight. The different starting cities provide a variability missing from that game. Gorgeous artwork. Excellent.

Small Press Wabash Cannonball - style game. Initial impressions from first 5-player game very favourable.

Attractive & clear map, high quality cards for shares & player aids. The action selection / turn-order tradeoff is neat, free choice of railroad starting cities makes for greater variety, ability to split expand action between multiple railroads sounds interesting (though nobody actually did this in our first play). The cherry on the top is the city income difference between monopoly and shared occupancy, which reduces the income of the first railroad when another railroad joins them.

What an excellent game!  Makes good use of the Chicago Express system.  Very well-produced--I've seen games from major companies with crappier production values.  The lack of money isn't a handicap as any gamer worthy of the name has stacks of fake cash lying about ( and likely very little of the real thing as it's all been spent on games. :) )

Train games. Some people love them, others hate them, but there sure are a lot of them. And I tend to like them. I knew this game would be somewhat similar to [thing=31730][/thing]. That is a game I quite like, but I never got a copy, as I already had [thing=37387][/thing] which, for me scratches the same itch. It's been a while since I've played Chicago Express, so I can't say how similar it is, but let's just say it is very similar. You could call it a ripoff, or a homage, or a variant, but chances are that if you like the one, you'll also like the other. And so do I. In fact, the only thing I can hold against this game is that it doesn't do anything new. It does some things differently from Chicago Express, like the way you select actions, but it certainly has the same feel. So if you can't get enough of Chicago Express, make sure to check this out. You'll probably like it as well. But does one need to own both? Probably not.

Played the Quined version and it was very attractive.  Very approachable rules set and very smooth playing.  It appears that you have to be very careful with your bidding.  I overpaid for my first couple of shares and was out of the running while another player scooped up a lot of the other ones with little competition and won in a landslide.  Cool game.

*Unplayed. Looks more elegant than Chicago Express? But American Rails is 50 dang dollars.

This could scratch the same itch as Power Grid, which makes it a little superfluous for me.

I had a warm feeling about it. After playing it, I'm adding fuzzy to my list of feelings I have for it. Tough decisions, piled on fun decisions, with twists of economic intrigue. Love it. I can't wait to keep it forever.

:: UPDATE ::
After another couple plays, I've decided that the end-game falls flat. It has in every game I've played so far: 4. The final round, and often the penultimate round are really boring and meaningless. So, because it doesn't actually build to a tense final finish, I lowered my overall rating down to a 7. If I can find a better train game, I'll possibly get rid of this one, which is unfortunate, since it features Alexandre Roche's art, which is always fantastic.

RATING: 7
American Rails is an older game that completely flew under my radar. I had never heard of this one before. But I was warned that there would be dire consequences if this didn't get to the table, so my sense of self-preservation insisted that I try it.

It's a stock market train game that focuses of route-building. There's no pickup and delivery in the game. Instead cities generate income for a route every round, which I assume is an abstracted sort of shipping income. There are companies which start the game with a set number of shares and train track. Generally the companies with more track also have more shares.

One neat feature of the game is the action selection mechanism. Each round every player will get three action phases. The actions spots are stacked vertically, with the more desirable spaces at the bottom. When you select an action, you place your player bit in that box and perform the action. Turn order for the next action phase/round is determined by the order of player bits from top to bottom. So taking a desirable action might mean you go last in the next phase.

The actions are largely about building track, with build-2, build-3 and build-4 spots, but there's also a spot to start an auction, put $5 in a company treasury, develop a city (increase its income by 2) or guarantee start player (and do nothing else).

Building track requires you to pay the terrain cost, plus surcharges for any other track/development that you build through. There's no restriction on direction, as you simply mark track with a cube in the hex. Some terrain only allows a single companies track.

Starting an auction will allow the player to start a single auction. So only one company can go up for auction each action phase. The minimum bid is 10. The money goes into the company treasury to fund track-building, so while you might want a cheap share, the company won't build very far unless you pay a higher price.

The game ends when either the seventh round is finished, all the shares are gone, or if four of the supply depots (company tracks & developments) drop to two or lower.

The game is a very clean, straightforward stock market game. Knowing how to value things and being able to effect efficient routes are key to the game. Timing is critical as well. If our game had gone another turn the last place player would have likely won.

I enjoyed the game a lot. The only drawback that I saw to the game is that the last round isn't particularly interesting, as everything is calculable and obvious.

RATING: 7.5
Enjoyed this. Really not sure what makes the difference between this and other share dilution games like Irish Gauge or Chicago Express. This somehow felt less opaque and less calculation-heavy. There is a greater promise of variety as well, as players choose where to start each railroad.

The leader (and eventual winner) in my first game was evident early on as the two-share railroad was started in NYC with no other railroads started near it. Maybe it was this particular fact (and error of the other players) that gave the game focus.

I like the standard turn order system with position determined by the move chosen in the previous round, with players having chosen better actions (lay four track, auction a share) going after those who took weaker actions (passing entirely, development). Action selection is WP-style: Once taken, it's gone for the round.

Estimating length of the game is important for share valuation, and was done quite poorly in my game. I think I might like it (even) a little better if there were a fixed number of turns (but certainly less than the maximum possible number of turns provided for on the board... that seems to be way too many). The game would become more easily calculable, which could be bad, but I was already playing as though it were calculable.

...I think my first play was a fluke. I think this is probably not that much better than comparable games. Holding it back from getting a better rating are 1. that it's too mathy and 2. I don't like it when the auctioned shares start to have seemingly calculable value.

I prefer this to Chicago Express, mostly because of the action selection mechanism, which is very good. I still don't care for the share dilution, and am not convinced that auctions are ideal for games of this type.

RATING: 4.5
I started playing expecting a game similar to and possibly better than Chicago Express (a game that I enjoy quite a bit), but American Rails turned out to be quite a disappointment. First of all, the artwork of this game (Quined edition) is really uninspired, and the board looks really, really bland. The gameplay itself starts off really interesting, but by the start of the second half the winner was determined and two other players were wishing it would end, but had to endure for another 45 minutes (during which the rich got even richer). The bonus for connecting two or more cities is huge, and there is too little you can do about it if there is no interesting stock left at that point. Really, I have no desire to play this game again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It took multiple plays to come clear, but AR really does stand on it's own next to CE. The variable starting locations, the evaporating stocks (if no one chooses to bid on them in an auction), and of course the really sleek action selection mechanism helps this Winsome-alike stand out from other, similar titles.

That it also plays as fast as CE (as long as overly AP players are avoided) is also a plus. I'm glad I now own a copy and hope to get it to the table more.

Quined games edition:
Excellent game. The turn order mechanism was superb and the variable starting cities for companies makes each game unique. These are also the two features that make this better than Chicago express. If it wasn't for the graphical appearance and the slightly longer playtime, Chicago Express might have become obsolete. The graphics aren't bad, they just aren't up to par with a Queen productions such as Chicago Express and German railways.

A very good game, but not really different enough from others in the genre (e.g., Chicago Express) to merit owning.  Maybe a slightly better game than Chicago Express, but I have a hard time with the plastic box, paper map, and lack of money in today's game production environment.  Much easier to get Chicago Express to the table due to its production quality.

Now that it is coming out in fully produced form, I am looking forward to adding it to the collection.  Only want the new version.

Absolutely not a bad game, but it's not my kind of game. it works well, it's relatively fast and simple for a railroads game but it has several downsides: horrible graphics, repetitive, probably scarse replayability and very very fiddly, an exercise in keeping track of scores, money, bills, change and so on. Russian Railroads is soo much better!

I played Wabash Cannonball/Chicago Express, the inspiration for American Rails, extensively upon its initial release.  I even made it to the finals in the first (and last?) CE tournament at the [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boardgaming_Championships]WBC[/url] in Lancaster, PA.  I totally deserved to lose, as purchasing a share for more than it can ever pay out is decidedly a bad idea.

American Rails is a funhouse mirror image of CE, with nearly all differences spelled out [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1067935/how-american-rails-differs-chicago-express]here[/url].

As enjoyable as CE is, it never felt fully developed.  The sudden entrance of the Wabash rail line (and its associated stock auction) is downright odd, the game can end too abruptly, fixed turn order is irritating, Chicago is overly important, and the initial stock bids tend to be rote.  American Rails, after a single play, appears to addresses all of these issues and more.  It's wild how this reworking completely escaped my notice until 2016.

[i]Update:[/i]

Still an interesting game, but my enthusiasm has waned. A player can quickly secure a power position if certain a company starts in a "superior" starting location - especially if no one else builds nearly.  At least CE stops players from making early boneheaded/overpowered moves by pre-establishing the railroads' entry points.  Plus, if you're losing CE badly with no hope of catching up, you can be confident that the game will be over quickly.  Not so with this one.  American Rails can be looooooong.

AR works best if all players have similar experience levels and no one screws up, neither of which is guaranteed in my group.  My conclusion: This version is probably too fragile for its own good. Note: In the last game, I was the screw-up.  So no finger-pointing here.

Great game! I'd say a slightly more gamer-y version of Chicago Express. Potentially more variability as unlike CE the first investor gets to choose where the rail company starts out from. Given a choice I would probably play this over CE.

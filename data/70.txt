RATING: 8
Set collection, pseudo-area control game.  This game has really nice pieces, and is easy and fun.  It plays quickly as well.  My only complaint about the game is the requirement of building the City Hall, which gives the builder no advantage.  It is generally something you do when you have nothing better to do, and hope the other players can't capitalize on it too much before you do.

Essentially a tile-laying (in the form of buildings), hand management game with great components.  Appears to work well with 2-3 players.  Theme is solid, as the game board develops into a city, and placements such as parks, factories, residences, buildings, and streetcars make some "sense".

Smashing game.  Lots of fun, a fair bit of depth, a sprinkling of luck, a well done theme and fantastic bits.  Families with kids over about 10 would also enjoy it.

Boy is the Shopping Centre powerful!  Just be careful that you don't let you opponents score with it too easily!  And if they're feeling mean they'll plant a factory or park right where you're planning to carry out your masterplan.

It's OOP, but get it if you can!

RATING: 6
Simple game of set collection with a touch of "take that".

Update:  It's been a while since I've played this one and tonight the game was just not all that much fun.  It suffers from the "screwed get more screwed" factor that just makes me ask "why am I playing this?"

Once you fall behind/get screwed out of your positions there's little to no hope of recovering.  The last 30 minutes of the game all I could do is pass.  I doubt this will hit the table again...

By far the best looking member of the Metropolis family of city building games.  The novelty (to me at least) is that the city blocks are assembled as you go along.  Not very deep and there's a fair chunk of luck, but it doesn't outstay its welcome.

man, i was blown away at how bad this one was after reading so many positive things.  the randomly-dealt cards are about all there is to it.  there are some choices in terms of park placement and such, but there is just a lot to dislike here.  nothing gets going until city hall is built, but there's little incentive to build it unless you have a 9-card lock on a region.  and if you do, guess where the parks should go before it's your turn?  it seems like the city hall should get auto-built by some random mechanic or even on a specific turn.  i'm  not sure i would play this again without trying some kind of negotiation variant, which is what i think the game needs.  and by the way, everybody who complains about setup is crazy.  just throw away the inserts, problem solved.  i'll give it another shot with fewer players, i guess.  i tried it with 5 and i've read that it gets worse with more.

This is not a good 5 player game as it gets too random with not enough control.  Looking forward to a play with 2-3 players.  Very nice components although the insert is way overproduced.

Unfortunately the only way that I ever end up playing it is with 5.  With 5 it should be regarded as a filler as you are too subject to the whims of fate, and the draw of cards.

A game with indeniably very pretty components, but we all know that gameplay is what really matters... Fortunately, Big City also manages to be engaging, simple and fun to play: a rarity!

Got it from Germany a while back and sessions have always been satisfying. Our enjoyment improves as we discover its subtleties and find new strategies. The handling of the property cards seems slightly constrained but it's aleviated by the game's trade variant.

Note: I bough this game new. While the contents say there should be 3 church buildings, the game only came with 2 and the plastic trays have spaces for 2 pieces: must be a printing mistake.

RATING: 7.5
If  Sim City, Cathedral and Chinatown had an illicit threesome in a plastic factory then Big City would be its inevitably gorgeous offspring.

My favourite city-construction game, for the whole of one week. As it happened we broke the seal on Chinatown one week after playing Big City, and despite its flat and far less luxurious make-up, it still towers sky-high over it thematically related 3d brother in my book.

As the game progresses, the beautiful buildings of the 3d city obscure the fact that there is actually not a lot going on. But boy do they make that look good. And its simplicity isn't wholly a bad thing either. Turns fly past, and overall game play will easily clock in under and hour. There are enough considerations to be made (placement of additional suburbs, choice of buildings, (re)directing trams, and blocking moves) to keep that hour very interesting, and, it can't be said enough, the way it looks invites game play. Puzzling out how best to utilize the plot for potential developments around it, without opening the door for others to profit more than you will ever yourself, is always interesting. And because the city districts are printed on tiles that can be laid out in many, many different ways, replayabilty is top notch.

Most people recommend it as a 2 or 3 player game, I actually feel that in a 3 player game it might be exquisit for 2 of them, but can be utterly pants for 1. Adjacent plots might be easier to come by, but as it also becomes more obvious what you area are staking out, parks seem to become very powerful indeed, not only ruining your plots, but wasting a turn discarding for better plots, which frequently trigger the need to spend another turn placing a district to make those new tiles work for you. By the time you are back in business town will have sprung up all around you and you'll just have to live with what is left to develop.

On avergae it is still a very good 3 player game, but personally I prefer it as a 2 or 4 player game. With 4 players it is slightly easier to place buildings awkwardly for a run-away leader. With 5 it's a bit too spread out and luck-driven. 

When I first played it I thought it was wonderful, but at the same time it left a teeny hollow aftertaste. During my first Chinatown session I realised what bothered me most, its static nature. Without trading and plot swapping it just lacks a certain dynamism, and the luck of the tile draw becomes very important indeed. But with poor development options it is hard to compete against players who were lucky to draw adjacent plots, especially if they also are lucky enough to draw the parks, which enable players to build over otherwise safe locations. Contruction of the Town Hall on a plot you own is more often a sacrifice for game play's sake than a genuine development that will help yourself, and it can even happen that one player is forced to make that sacrifice, being the only one who can match the requirements.

It hasn't stopped me from enjoying Big City though. Far from it, it's one of those games I wish that would come out more often, but experience tells that here it gets pushed aside in favour of Chinatown most of the time. I'm sure that my ideal city construction game combines elements of both of them. Until then I happily play both.

The sort of game that makes it so much easier to make new converts to our hobby.

RATING: 7
It's a game about building a city, rather like SimCity, but very elegant and without the horrid bookkeeping that could result if you didn't translate a video game to a board game very well.  Building layout, in other words, has an effect on how well new buildings are scored.

That, simple rules with interesting building interactions, and the nice plastic structures is quite a lot to go on.  I wish there was an expansion with even more buildings.  It's easy to add more yourself, but you just can't get the nice plastic buildings easily for this purpose.

This is a light tactical game where players are trying to build the highest scoring properties in the city plots they have options on. Mostly it's about hand management and short term planning but you should add a little luck also if you want to win. Game is quick and has gorgeous components. Taking everything into account, this is a great family/casual gamers game.

I quite enjoyed this. Would love to play it again with the goal in mind to build the shopping center. Seems kind of odd, that [i]that[/i] would be the highest aspiration in the game, but the end product is nice. Most people who claim not to care about theme would not be bothered by it so why should I?This is one of those games like Clans that has the curious quality of being equally enjoyable at optimal or sub-optimal levels of play. You can really just play cards from your hand wherever they lie. Or you can get serious with the planning. Both ways seem like a satisfying way to play the game. Because of this I could probably play Big City while very tired and still enjoy it. Big City, like any good game however, does reward good planning and optimal play.

If it somehow managed to play six it would probably be the perfect game in my opinion.  The length is good.  It isn't too heavy.  The bits are awesome.

Played twice. Both 2-player.

Not as "friendly" as those little plastic buildings would lead you to believe. Quite a bit of screwage going on - which I like.

I have a feeling playing this with 4+ might be...interesting, in a chaotic way.

---- update ----
Played a 4-p game last night...definitely has a different feel; some players felt frustrated by the speed at which the board changed - I didn't mind it too much, but could see their point. Liked it better as a 2-p...have to give it a 3-p whirl soon!

Interesting game.  Plays pretty quickly and does offer some interesting choices throughout.  It does seem with the way the dependancies work you could end up in a situation that wouldn't be very fun, if no one wants to waste their turn for the City Hall, but in my first game this wasn't an issue in any way.  One of the coolest parts of the game is the end... when the city is all built.  The cool 3D pieces look so neat on the table.  Even though I don't think this one will ever end up being great, the 3D pieces and its ability to cover that 2 - 3p game range makes it a keeper.

Kellemes csalódás ez a játék, mert egész jó hangulatot ad a játék folyamán. Van benne nagy fokú keresztbehúzás lehetősége a másik játékos részéről. Például hiába próbálok egy egy nagyobb beruházást összehozni, ah az ellenfél kineszeli és oda parkosít vagy esetleg egy gyárat épít, amivel még az össze környező mező értékét is romokba dönti. A játék minősége elfogadható, tipikus régi hangulatot ad. Bár szerintem, ha kisebb elemekből készültek volna a város elemei, akkor nagyobb táblát is össze lehetett volna hozni, bár így is elagyaltunk majd másfél órát vele. Tetszik, hogy nem fix körös a megoldás, hanem addig megy a játék, míg mindenki nem passzol.

Used to play this years back a lot and had fond memories of it. Played again lately and it reminded me why it hasn't got played in a while. The game was very quiet the whole time with all players just planning their own moves and no real conversation needed. This is the ultimate multiplayer solitaire game. I'm sure this game was amazing stuff when it first came out as all the really cool mechanisms and bits are there. Just maybe outdated now and just a good game not Great like I remembered it to be.

RATING: 5.5
Abstract, dry & annoying for me.  Perhaps there is a variant that would help, but the base game seems to involve a lot of annoying gameplay where you just set up the board for the next guy to score more points than you just scored.

comments: too much luck.  you'll never really have the property cards that you want.  you always seem to be setting up your opponents so you have to play cautiously.  it seems like you have a lot of options, but you don't.  in our 2 player game, we never had 3 properties in a row to build the large residential or commercial blocks.  i can't imagine playing with 4 or 5 players.

As an urban planner, this game appealed to me and was quite a bit of fun!

There's a lot of luck of the draw going on here, but choosing which cards to draw and when to play them to score the most points (and deny others points) is key.  So, timing your hand to set yourself up and deny your opponents is where the game is at, as well as trying to mask your planning intentions to avoid being foiled by your opponents.

A very nice game this. You need a bit of luck in the cards you draw to get properties next to one another but you can engineer this slightly. Be careful that your play doesn't allow somebody to build something big.

RATING: 8
Based on 1 play with 3 players:

One of those neat games that is fun whether you feel like playing as strategically as possible or just playing turn to turn. There's tense and interesting choices to make here, all wrapped in a very simple system. The way the luck of the draw works is great! You have just enough information to know when you should draw from each pile.

The pacing/length is excellent, and it's cool to watch the city grow, and the little city pieces add to the theme a lot. Not enough games really feel like you're building something, but Big City definitely does!

Also? Just the right amount of screwage.

Love at first play!

Rated 8 after one play. I'd never heard of this game, and apparently it's hard to track down at this point, but after one play, I'm pretty impressed. The game consists of a numerical grid, somewhat like Acquire or Chinatown, but players play cards to place buildings on the board, nabbing points for each placement.

The game flies by, and the combo of hand management and building placement is slick. Throw in a City Hall with special bonuses, a cable car that gets gradually added to the board, and there's some surprising theme to the game. I'm more than happy to try this again.

The card management mechanic is very much fun. Long term planning for when you want wich adresses, and watching what districts interrest them is only the beginning. the two Parks and the Factories give Big City a soubtle, but sometimes gamechanging, player interaction cick.
Very good game. Wanna play again. My neighbour allways says it's too long. I don't remember it that way.

Light spacial card-driven game with great components and easy to grasp theme and mechanisms. Would function well as a gateway game. There's quite some luck of the draw, as well as screwage. Still, a very enjoyable experience with 2 or 3 players. Play with the limited, single tram line variables. Keeper, just for the bits and the ease of play.

Will happily play this game from time to time, and might even suggest it depending on the audience.

Big City is a fairly light, best with 2 game that is essentially about collecting cards that correspond to spots on the board, and then using those to plop down various building types to score points.

The game has several hooks present. First, the building pool is shared, and it definitely runs out, particularly the smaller ones (residences and commercial of 1 or 2 plot size), as well as the one plot special buildings which call for specific neighbours (i.e.: 2 residences adjacent, &c.). Second, the street car lines, which are multipliers, can often turn into evil pissing matches as they are frequently used to bisect plots to prevent larger buildings from being placed (they are also often run into dead ends, presuming that one plays with the proper non-branching rules). Third, the board is modular, and because having cards for adjacent plots is a good thing, being able to place neighbourhoods in advantageous ways can greatly aid that cause. But your opponent might not be pleased with where you put that new plot of land. All the better.

The bottom line is that Big City is a lighter game. It is card driven, and getting a good run of cards at the right time will make you win, especially if you can get a majority of the special spoiler pieces (parks, factories) which can be laid down anywhere on the board (with certain restrictions), and which do not require one to have the actual plot cards for the spaces they are being put down on (i.e.: hose city). That said, especially at the two scale, there are a lot of little things that one can do to win at this game, and at that 2 scale, one is often able to KNOW where the other cards for a neighbourhood are, as the decks run out. This, in turn, makes this game much less chaotic (and more interesting). Because the piece pool is shared, and stays the same at all scales, this game is best with only 2, in fact, I exclusively play it with that number. Any more than that, and you have almost no way of knowing where people have pairs or triplicates of cards in a row, and you can inadvertently aid them with placements much too easily. With 2 though, this is one of my favourites. It's light, but it's always a blast.

Nice game. I like the fact that there is zero player state on the board, which means that people tend to play for themselves, or at least screw others in general, rather than targeted screwage. Has a bit of the Chinatown feel, with trying to get neighboring building plots. The "non branching" train cars are the only way to go.

Big City was, I think, the last 'old big box' 999 Games-game remaining unplayed. The game's concepts are not all that silly: by placing buildings on a city grid, points are scored. But the score can be increased by placing certain types of buildings close together, or by keeping them apart avoiding a malus. It's a game of topological optimisation; helped along considerably by the lavish appearance with little plastic buildings.

But I just found it a boring exercise. As player you're quite dependent on the card draw, and although part of the game is making do with whatever you're dealt, I just couldn't be bothered to make the effort. I guess I'm getting a little spoilt after all this time, but a game should do more than demanding these simple min-max-like calculations of me. It is also hard to directly block other players because apart from a few special cards plots of land cannot be blocked by others. Once you have the cards in hand, you have a near-exclusive right to those areas. But you can never tell if your opponents have or haven't got the surrounding plots, so it all turns into a bit of gamble: scoring now, or later with the risk that some maluses are involved. The only remedy is lowering the player number considerably so odds that you can do more are increased... But odds they remain. I can think of other titles which use a few parts from Big City without suffering needlessly from flaws of their own, and I'd rather play those than this dinosaur.

Components: The cards and the district tiles are nondescript but workable. The plastic buildings are a delight to play with; the detail on them is so rich that during the other player's turn I found myself gazing intently at the city we were creating.

Experience: An interesting manifestation of set collecting, whereby sets can be used to create different sorts of buildings, and different numbers can end up adjacent to each other, even though they are not sequential. It was a pleasure to build the city, and being able to draw back up to five cards made my choices seem fresh, unlike so many other games where it is more work than fun to replenish my hand.

This is a great game that I always forget to play. The pieces are great (I have the original, I don't know what the re-release will be like). I especially like the City Hall piece which scores no points, but someone must play it before the game can progress beyond a certain point. It's like a 4 person game of Chicken.

Every review I have read on this game raves about the components. It is very breathtaking to open the game for the first time and see layer after layer of stuff. As a bonus it is not a bad game either. The game is so simple it can be played with preteens. There is a strategic game in the box belaying its simplicity. The first time I played I went through the motions of placing the best buildings down while my girlfriend was setting up high scoring combos. I wanted to play again right away to use some of her strategy. If it ends up to not be your cup of tea all is not lost. You can still pull it out and drool over the cool bits. One of the best games to open for the first time as the bits just keep coming.  Unfortunetly you will have to throw out the trays as the pieces just do not go back in very easily.

[Delonge] Exceptional and overlooked Euro. Wonderful interactions as you try to grab real estate and cluster the right buildings into your real estate. Simple decisions keep the game flowing fast.  Great interactions without allowing for payers to hose one another. Gameplay is fast and the limited pieces and space put a short clock on the game. Oh, anddid I mention  I had fun, even when losing? I detest Carcassone, and I see this as my alternative to that game. Also, the spectacular production is a beautiful thing to behold, again proving that Goldseiber is synonymous with brilliant bits.

I love city building, I love how this game grows in front of you, I love so much about this game. What I wish though was that the gameplay was a little more interesting. It's extreme hand management where you're cycling through decks trying to get a few that line up together and that element is a little opaque at first and I tend to favor very transparent and intuitive rules that get out of the way. That is what keeps it from the table.

I generally like games of brinksmanship, and that's what this one is about in terms of deciding what to build vs making yourself a target. While it has some interesting elements, it felt too chaotic in terms of not being messed with since you really have little to no idea who has or is willing to use which cards to thwart your plans. I've only played with 5P which I hear may be the worst number so perhaps it's a better experience with less.

Fairly good city builder, a nice development on Metropolis/Boomtown/Downtown/San Francisco and uses the same mechanism of commerce needing housing, but housing is devalued by industry. Players are seduced by the loads of plastic bits, but the really interesting part is the modular board. This allows players to influence the city shape before & during the game and brings unrelated locations adjacent to each other, so making location cards worth a lot more. Pick it up before it goes out of print.

Big City is city development through card drafting. Due to the randomness of the card draws, and (especially with more players) limited influence on where the major victory point producers (town hall, tram) end up going the luck factor is pretty high, certainly higher than I expected of a development game. Then again, it doesn't intend to be an economic simulation and plays pretty quickly, so the luck doesn't hurt too much. The plastic bits are very nice and make it a favourite with the tactile crowd.

I didn't really see what was the big deal about this game.  The pieces were really nice, and I did like that the completed city looked like an actual city, but there was far too much luck involved, and the game just didn't feel clean.  It was difficult to really develop a strategy.

I'd like to try it again, but with 2 players.  I think it would rely less on luck in that case, and be more enjoyable.

I found it to be a bit like Chinatown without the negotiation. The plastic bits are great and the game wouldn't be half as fun with out it. Setting up the scoring bonuses is key and I found there to be a good deal of player interaction. Doesn't last too long and the completed board with all of the buildings is really nice looking.  I feel like I could play better with more experience which is a sign of a good game to me.  I think it has potential to have a bit of a problem with a runaway leader because of the big point combinations.

An easier game that I think would fit nicely into the Gateway Game category.  It has a large element of luck, but this is balanced fairly well with non-obvious decisions.  The illusion of control is lower than, say, Carcassonne, and as a result probably not as good a gateway game or just plain game.  Overall, though, I enjoyed my play both when lady luck was against me and later when she pushed me into a win.

The pieces are excellent looking, too, which could help the gateway-ness.

This is the first Delonge design I have played, and it has left a strong desire in me to seek out more of his works.  Alan R Moon's Ticket to Ride is often heralded as being the great gateway, along with Settlers, and as much as I enjoy both of these titles I believe Big City is truly a forgotten gem that lends itself to inviting new people into gaming.  Big City is strong in both game play and aesthetic qualities.  Tougher tactical, and strategic decisions than first thought are required to be competitive.  The element of luck is reduced by the ability to play the odds and exchange cards to better your situation.  I agree with comments made that the more players Big City is hosting the more chaotic the feel, however, chaos is not always an element I frown upon.  The sweet spot here is three players, but it scales quite well.  The additional bonus that Big City offers is the tapping into of the inner child, as it impossible to not be genuinely excited while watching this little, big city grow.

Love the organic nature of the game.  A lot of strategy, even though your choices become more and more limited after you pass the halfway point, as buildings become scarce or non-existent.

Love the big city pieces, but the game does feel fairly dated at this point. Non-branching street cars is the way to go, and much of the fun derives from the production, which is just fine in my book. Still, not compelling enough for me to reach for it, given other options, and sold it.

786- have you ever met a city planner? not the big political appointee.I mean the one that works 50 hours a week & gets paid for 40. Even when he's not working, his eyes will be squinting. In order to get a hint of their lives, just play this mega-attractive game w/ 2-5 players who have great dreams to bring forward. Game components are beyond belief and the pattern of play almost never repeats. Will you be the new hero of The Fountainhead or will you be the loser w/ squinty eyes? (198)

Big City an obvious descendant of Sid Sackson's Metropolis, but plays very differently because there's no collaboration/negotiation.  It feels a little ho-hum to me.  Score a few points here, score a few more points there, it's all the same, really.  I recommend playing that streetcar lines may not branch.  I'm not sure why Rio Grande decided to change this rule.

A tile placement game greatly enhanced by the gorgeous pieces. I'm quite poor at this game, but I enjoy it and love the look of the game when finished so much that I don't care. I've only ever played it with three. I can see how the game might suffer with more players. 

**UPDATE- Have now played it with 5, and the game isn't as good, but it also isn't as bad as I expected. The luck of the draw becomes a bigger factor with 5, and planning becomes more difficult. It has a much different feel, but the game length seemed about the same.

Pretty bits with huge luck of the draw. The building prerequisites are pretty obtuse, too; and during the endgame lots of players have nothing to do but screw other people over, which introduces a kingmaker element. It was still rather fun, though, largely due to its brevity and lack of weight.

Played it again and I have the same thoughts I had years ago. It's a good/ok game, but nothing I would ask for. 

It's more tactical/strategical than you might think at first. The "negative" cards can blow up your plans which feels out of place, as everything else is safe. I don't mind to have the option to interact in a destructive way, but this one is just about getting (un)lucky.

Very fast playing set collection tile laying game. The luck of the card draw can be nasty and the occasional kingmaker can ruin things, but this is a very cool, simple, fun little game.  Card draw luck can effect thingss a lot but if you draft cards intelligently, that effect is minimized.  The "kill the leader" mechanisms through the factories can also help beat on someone who got an abnormally good card draw.  The turn to turn decisions about what to build and where are interesting and the long term strategy on what cards to draw and what you are shooting for in the future is also very compelling.  The scoring and different buildings add some meat to the game without being overly complicated and the city hall game of chicken is kinda neat.  Probably the best thing is how fast it is- this game would be a dud if it took two hours but the play is fast and it really offers a lot for the short time frame of the game.

I like Big City, I really do. Reason why it doesn&#039;t deserve a clean 9 or 10 is the fact that there&#039;s too much to do. Too many decisions to make and too many options to choose from on every turn. Through out the first and the second game I was really confused what to do and how it would result. Don&#039;t get me wrong though, as a building game Big City beats many others.

Excellent city building game, one of the best I have tried.  You actually have a realistic looking city taking shape with the great bits included and the building rules follow the law of logic which is great.  This is quite easy to learn and about an hour to play so very accessible while still having a good portion of both strategy and tactics as well. 

Planning is quite necessary and choices are very important, especially concerning which card stacks to draw from and when. Getting two adjacent cards can be quite important and then setting yourself up for a nice placement for those cards by making sure certain pre-requisites are met equally important. Some really great moves can be set-up and pulled off netting you some good points. Lots of other things to consider too like; when and where to build city hall, when and where to start the VERY important subway, do you keep or toss the park card early on or just slap it down, do you toss the factory card or build it early or just keep it for the screwage effect when you know where your opponent will build later, do you hold out for the church or build something else there, and then there are times you are just holding out for certain points but dangerously so as your plan could get spoiled causing you to waste precious time. 

There is a bit of luck in the cards but with only 2 or 3 at the table it is minimal as you choose which stacks to draw from and there are enough neighborhoods to go around. A great game but yet another one that will be chaotic with more than 2 or 3 players so I won't bother trying. 2 probably best for the additional control, only caveat is knowing your opponents cards is much easier which is kinda good and bad. 

A great meaty one hour middle weight

A good game with great bits that plays in an hour or less?!? Wow...that's impressive. Those three factors put together make this game very worthy of the high ratings it receives. Strategy, clever placements, a bit of chaos, and a little screwage factor combine very nicely to form a game worthy or repeated play. Though the gameplay is nothing truly unique or even very special, the overall package is something great. Plays best with 2 people, good with 3, and a bit too chaotic with more than that.

Big City is all theme and pieces for me.  If it were less overproduced and not about city building, I wouldn't give it a second thought.

Would have rated it an 8 or 9 back in 2000-01 when I was playing it alot, and while the bits are beautiful and the game play mechanics are very straightforward, there is a bit of a luck factor (it's always good to get 2-3 adjacent properties to enable you to build larger buildings).  My main concern with the game is that the player who builds City Hall (thus triggering most of the bonus scoring options) is almost always at a disadvantage because he/she almost always winds up setting up the other players for big scores while getting zero points for City Hall itself.  For this reason, I prefer the game with 3 rather than a full table of 4 or 5 as the screwage factor on the City Hall player is alot less, or so it seems.

You place boards with numbered spots. Then you play cards randomly selected that have numbers that match the spots on the boards. Try to play 2 or 3 in a row to score more. You put down buildings in those spots. Various complexities are added like playing a subway to improve scoring. You have to think about your best options, but the game seems heavily influenced by the luck of the card draw. Still it is fun with really nice building pieces.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Big and beautiful but the game play is pedestrian.  You can do some things to gather connected cards - and sometimes it works, and sometimes not.  I feel most of the game is looking for a good opportunity - and then crossing your fingers for getting cards to work out.

Metropolis has more interesting relationships among buildings, and more control over the plots of land you build on.  It's the better game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Components are outstanding as was usual for the Goldsieber big boxes. The gameplay doesn't completely hold this promise. It's an ok game but a bit too luck-dependent and straight forward for strategy gamers and a bit too dry for family gamers. The challenge is to set up the board for scoring big with the subsequent placement of a high-value building. There are a few buildings that can be placed on any spot by other players to thwart these usually obvious plans. In a competent group of players the winner should be the player whose main scoring opportunity isn't destroyed that way. Should get better with fewer players. I only played it with four so far.

As everybody says, great bits that really enhance the game play. Underneath the flash is a superb game. Sure there is some luck in drawing property cards, but there is a fair amount of agony in choosing an action each turn. And there's a sense of helplessness as other players enact their turns. There's a tension here for me that is similar to Through the Desert.

Big City had great potential but has many obvious flaws that cry out for variants. For example, there is little incentive for anyone to build the city hall, which opens up the more interesting buildings and parks seem completely counterproductive. As well, the mechanic of cards representing each block is too simplistic - you get a lot of dead cards that way. It is very light and fast so it may appeal to some people on that basis alone. There are many other superior strategy games that are also light and fast. If you have several hundred games you may consider this to play once every year or two.

RATING: 7
A game about drawing city tiles and then placing buildings on groups of those tiles.

The Good: A gateway game. The rules are pretty easy for the first few buildings. Placing the plastic buildings is fun !

The Bad: Placing City Hall is a bottleneck to many other buildings. However, no one wants to place City Hall as they basically lose a turn.
The rules get fiddly for the higher point value buildings. This will get easier after a couple of games.

Based on one play; three-player game.  Fun game; neat pieces.  I think we got the neighboring vs. adjacent part mixed up but that was probably due to the fact that the rules are translated.  I liked this game and my rating is wavering between a seven and an eight.  I think I'd like to have this game.

We needed to play this a few times to get it right as the rules on scoring the different building types are a bit complex and no one realised at first the importance of getting the City Hall position right.

There is a good opportunity to plan ahead and I still have a lot more to learn about winning strategies and the best time to play the factories. This is a deeper game than it may first appear.

A fascinating game.

Light game, feels a little bit like Simcity -boardgame. A luck-driven, because you need right cards to build what you want, but that's OK - there are still decisions to do. Those plastic buildings looks great, althought overalry the components aren't very good.

Played twice, 3p, 5p.  I didn't enjoy this as much as I wanted to.  But, I think the game is pretty good.  I think I had the worst luck possible in this game.  So, I should probably give it another try.  And, after giving it another try, I again had the worst luck possible.  Or did I?  Or is it that one must play non-optimally?  I really hate that in games - I have to help myself just a little bit to avoid helping somebody else a WHOLE lot, and that other person could be just about any other player.  I don't have any real interest in playing this game again...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of THE most beautiful bits & components of all my boardgames.  An excellent 3 player game (with 4, control is decreased considerably).  I somewhat describe this as a game of "offensive Medina".  It has more luck involved (with card draws) but skill is also needed to do well while blocking opponents when necessary.  I think Medina is a better & purer, but longer.  This is short & sweet and satisfying.  I'm very intrigued about the "Bigger City" variant where you play with two sets of this gorgeous game.  Probably plays at it's best for three players only for less chaos but I can see doing this with four in teams of two each (hey, a new variant - this game is so open for variants).

Remembered this game from my childhood when I played it with my twin brother when my relative Lamar brought the game to the Rice Family Christmas Dinner...:-)  Finally was able to acquire this OOP game from Germany at a relatively decent price (far cheaper even with shipping than any I've seen available in the USA).  I enjoy the 3D aspect of the game, and the game is relatively easy to teach and learn.

Not a bad game - it plays quickly, which is good, but ultimately, someone HAS to be the one to build the city hall, and thus, lose a turn (effectively), SOLELY so the other buildings can be built. The waiting game to see that happen can be somewhat frustrating.

I love it, even though I sucked at my first game of it. I look forward to MANY more plays.

Update: Would you look at that? More plays and it's a 9! I like the balance of hand management versus the timing of the buildings. With experienced players it can seem like someone has an unfair lead, and a timely play puts you with them or out in front.

I played this two player.  It was ok, with lots of plastic and someone had painted the buildings so it looked especially nice.  The game played ok, where you played cards to place buildings and if you were next to other buildings you got more points.  The game was ok, but not something you really wanted to play again.

While I enjoyed this game quite a bit while the action was going on the later turns and ending seem anti-climactic even when I got jumped on the last play to end up in 2nd place it didn't seem that exciting. I'm thinking this one should only be played with the maximum number of players.

Quite taken with this game after just 2 plays.  Fast, lots of room for strategies, nice interplay of the buildings, streetcars, parks and factories for point scoring.  Wonderful components to boot!

Great game.  Unlike other games with a heavy "take that" factor, this one makes you feel a little better about getting screwed over.  A well placed factory can destroy a players plans, as they did mine this evening.  Still had fun playing.

This game also has a kingmaking problem, even if it might be unintentional.  It is quite easy for one player to be the target of several factories/parks unknowingly while another player escapes relatively unscathed.

Was waiting on the reprint but gave up.  Bought a lightly used RGG copy on Mar 7 2010.

Great game of tense card play. The rules may seem a bit opaque at first but it plays like a gateway game.  Can suffer from some analysis paralysis for some though.

I like the game of chicken trying to establish the bonus conditions *before* building your building but knowing that you may be telegraphing your position too strongly causing someone to trash your hopes with a park, factory, or well timed streetcar placement that bisecs your properties.

Good game. It says a lot for the design if I can play oh so horribly but still want to play again.

Played 15-20 times. 

Update: Played again in 2012 after a 4-year hiatus. Down from an 8 to a 7. I like the game but it´s not great. The endgame is almost always anticlimatic and the City Hall thing is not very elegant. I will enjoy playing it once or twice a year. And the components are great.

Very nice game. Good game-play and it´s nice to see the city grow. Haven´t tried any of the variants, but I don´t think the `Who´ll build the City Hall´-problem is that much of a problem.

Very pretty game to look at when set up.  Have gotten several non-serious gamers to try the game, and they enjoyed it, although had a bit of trouble making the 'long-term' planning to build the warehouse and such things.  Plays quickly, and works with two players.  Had it, traded it, berated by my wife, and re-acquired.  This cycle continued a few times, but now it is officially gone.  Not enough control to be very serious.  Good but not great game, superceded by city builders such as Urban Sprawl.

I heard pretty good things about this one and was fairly disappointed. Not a bad game, but it felt like Chinatown without the negotiation: lots of luck and fishing for draws next to each other. Then you try to build up a location before building on it, to maximize points, which just telegraphs what you're doing to everyone else so they can mess it up. Not very fun.

Takes a little while to get going but once the city hall is down you want every turn to be your own. Pacey, nice array of options and neat bits. What with this and Manila, Mr. Delonge certainly hit a sweet spot when it came to designing games that appeal to both gamers and non-gamers at the same time. Added bonus in Big City: the theme is not medieval.

I really liked this one.  Great player interaction and super components as well.  Big City has a such a classic feel I could see rating this a 10 (with 3 or 4 players).  Can get nasty with the factories and parks.  A little chaotic but so short it hardly matters.  Deserves a reprint.

Big City is a game that [apparently] will never see the light of day again, and honestly it's probably for the better. It's a really fun game, but it's awfully luck-driven and doesn't scale well at all. With new entries like Urban Sprawl, Suburbia, City Tycoon, etc in the genre coming out more regularly, I don't see this ever succeeding again [despite the fact it still commands a huge OOP price].

The game is kind of a rummy game at its heart. You draw cards matching tiles on the board, and you need to occasionally play some cards [any number that all line up, from 1 to 3 city blocks "long"] to put buildings on the board, then and only then you'll refresh your hand [draw-play/discard, or vice-versa, is the central rummy mechanic, and it exists here as discard/play-draw]. The catch is that you get a whole lot more points waiting to either set up neat stuff around the blocks you plan to play on or set up long chains of blocks to support bigger buildings.

The real killer in the game is the shopping mall building which provides most of the tension. The rest of the game, played well, is about trying to set yourself up to build this whopper of a building [worth potentially 1/3 or so of your final score] without letting others take advantage of it. To build the shopping mall, you need to basically have one of every other building type "nearby" [adjacent], so whenever anyone builds anything else that placement will always affect the likelihood of a shopping mall coming out.

The game can be won and lost quite handily if you're not paying attention / your opponents aren't paying attention, but it can also be won and lost just by not drawing the right cards. There's a relatively large amount of things to think about, and a relatively small amount of control, which really would sour the game on most players [I'm a card gamer, so I'm used to that]. I don't see it ever coming back in vogue.

THe random nature of card drawing, and the lack of good reasons to return cards to the pile, make this game feel less fun. Another on the list that I feel really wants for some minor tweaking.

Get cards in districts, then erect buildings and score points according to your neighbors or districts. It&#039;s okay, try to maximize your points and react to what other people are building. Near the end of the game, buildings run out and you can force a player to use their card suboptimally (sort of like Zugzwang in chess) which needs to be fixed.

Definitely an acquired taste... a game that requires a lot of control to prevent opponent's scoring opportunities or to set up your own, yet uses luck of the draw to limit your options radically .

A fantastic tile-laying city building game inside a decidedly ugly box. Simple rules makes for easy introduction and lots of plastic components can draw a crowd. Depth comes from playing off of or trying to confound other players moves.

The only flaw I can think of, (other than the difficulty in finding a copy), is as each game comes to a close there is very little surprise; the person in the lead several turns before is likely to remain the victor.

A little random -- if you don't like dice games, you'll hate, hate, HATE Big City, because too much is out of your control.  But if you don't mind the chaos of not being able to completely dictate your fate, there's fun to be had here.

Also, the pieces are just gorgeous.  This game was obviously created during a non-recession.

Modern game designers desperately trying to dredge up new mechanics should take a look at this design gem and learn simplicity from it. Rightly well-regarded and justifiably difficult to get your hands upon, it offers a wealth of strategic choices from remarkably simple card turnover, and the City Hall altruism mechanism is a stroke of genius. It also scales incredibly well, although perhaps it is slightly less pacy with five. When you consider the totally flexible map options, I cannot possibly see the weak links in this game.

Comes out once or twice a year. Can't believe it's out of print and expensive now! You'll never pry it from me! :-) EDIT: $150 on eBay pried it from me. 

I like the vibe, the board looks great while you're playing, and there's quite a lot of room for player improvement. Nice all around game. Setup/teardown time can be a little slow-ish mostly due to being careful with the building bits.

I'm in the camp that says this should only ever be played as a 3 player, which gives enough turns for players to be satisfied they can play strategically and create setups that will be rewarded - or crashtackling other players's setups for the observant ones. As a 3 player, it's a nice 30-40 minute romp - play cards, draw cards, plus other options. Add a point for the wonderful diarama it produces.

This is a fast-paced city-building game which is somewhat reminiscent of Acquire in that you draw grid spaces in which you're allowed to build.  If you draw adjacent grid spaces, you can build bigger buildings; you also get bonuses for certain types of buildings depending on what's next to them.  While there is certainly a luck-of-the-draw element, there's also a lot of trying to figure out what your opponents will do when, so you can maximize your own builds.  I found this pretty enjoyable for a light game.

TRY July/05: Seems ok, as long as everyone is aware to prep their spots prior to building.  ie. setup the multipliers, such as city hall & streetcars.

Personally, I think there are too many banks, post offices & cinemas.  I'd rather see 2 of each (instead of 3), plus some other types -- possibly a school beside housing & park, and maybe a library beside a business & other special building? Or something with a factory as a condition.

RETRIED with hospital (beside factory & business), school, and library, as suggested above.  I added an inner city bonus for Hospital & Library.  Played nicely.

It's been a long time between games and I always enjoy the playing. Each game is visually different and a delight to see at game end. As for game play, there are moments when you have to hold off building in order to score big. Then there's the uncertain tension that someone will thwart your plans with placing a streetcar/factory/park across your desired plot. It has my favourite scoring method, similar to Scrabble. Best with 3 as 2 is anticlimatic and 4/5 has too much chaos/downtime. Have to play this more often.

Fairly quick playtime. Cute components. Most of the game revolves around deducing where your opponents are preparing a big point score, and then making that area worse for them. In some ways it's a little random since you need to be lucky and draw the contracts for several consecutive lots in order to build the larger buildings for the most points.

1 play. The game as explained to me is broken. Placing the city hall piece stalls the game until someone falls on their sword. It is especially broken when one can not add neighborhoods so the person with the 15 lot and only a diagonal one has no incentive to place the city hall piece. Beyond the start, the factory and park pieces just didn't add anything special (often one felt the card was a disadvantage as a draw was wasted).

Plays well with 3 and 4 players. With 5 it is difficult to plan ahead. 
Strategy is more complicated that first appears. You try to collect sets of properties for your buildings. The large blocks and special building that require a mix of adjacent  buildings are more valuable. At the same time your opponents can block you. 
The bits are fantastic and add to the experience

Simple game with much luck in the drawing of cards to collect sets. The only major decision point is which card stacks to draw from. If you get the cards you want, everything else follows. I love the Factories and Parks, and wish they could be recycled in some way to keep screwing other players (think natural disaster tiles!), like the Wasabi! cards in Wasabi. As it is, I feel Wasabi! is a game that provides a similar feel, but is much more involved and better.

Good game for the 3D city-building experience. Face it: if it weren't for the joy of fiddling with the chrome of the buildings and watching the city take shape, I probably wouldn't play this game at all.

This is a beautiful game with a sense of accomplishment when it is done. It is fun to see how the city looks at the end, which will always be different.

This is a good game with opportunities for some strategy and tactics, but it will take further plays to see how that balances with the luck of card draws. Either way, it seems like it will be a good medium weight game for casual to serious gamers. I look forward to future plays and also trying it with 2 players.

Ok, the games looks fantastic. Nice chunky plastic bits (if only they were molded in full colour). The city is small when fully constructed at the end of the game but boy, what a game! It's a quick points for placement game. There are interesting strategies (using streetcards, blocking opponents with factory, parks, etc) and it provides some thoughtful play (do I trade cards for better ones, build up my area so I can put in a shopping mall later, etc). Good fun.

Let's get the obvious question out of the way first...is this better than Sid Sackson's "Metropolis"? In many ways the answer is yes. Big City has better (and more) components, a modular board setup, additional scoring potential (city hall, street cars), and the scoring is more streamlined. However, Metropolis is a cleaner, less fiddly game with a little more luck and the final scoring is not always known until the end of the game. Based on my ratings of the two, I like this one a little more overall since it emphasizes strategy more than luck...basically due to the numbered card draw piles (vs. a single random pile in "Metropolis". The downside to this is that a player's strategy can be anticipated based on the surrounding buildings vs. the cards in their hand (the numbered backs). In "Metropolis" the players know the plots owned, but not the cards or which buildings they are likely to place. "Metropolis" also offers a negotiation and property sharing rule that can have major scoring implications, and this can be used to screw another player. I guess you could separate and stack the cards in "Metropolis" indentical to "Big City" and have a similar game experience? Regardless, they are both good games but this one edges out the aforementioned since it offers more placement and scoring options, the scoring is more streamlined and it's a little more immersive in the planning/building theme.

The card draw (and the factory placement) can be a bit frustrating, but it's a city building game nonetheless.

My wife enjoys this game a lot. She likes the competetive "crap on your neighbor" element, and it's fun to build a city together. Big City is a fairly light game, and once you've played it a few times, you'll have the basic strategies down. There aren't many emergent strategies which depend upon player choices, but that's alright. It's a fun, competitive game well-suited for an end-of-long-day play. The bits are great too. In Big City, players take turns playing property cards, which allow them to place properties. If you can manage to collect and then play adjacent cards, you can play double and triple properties for more points. There are a variety of special properties beyond the basic homes and businesses, including churches, factories, banks, and so on. Each has either an effect on scoring neighboring properties (factories and parks) or can only be played in certain places (churches, cinemas, etc.). There is also a streetcar players are able to build, which benefits certain kinds of properties. The level of complexity here is about that of Carcassonne, although there is more planning involved.

We've found that increasing the number of players makes the game more chaotic, more tactical and less strategic, and increases run-away-leader problems. But it's still fun, so it gets played.

Our game seemed to lag because no one wanted to get stuck building the city hall.  It seems as if the city hall might need to be placed in the beginning of the game to avoid this.  It's an interesting game, but it's not too complicated.  All the appropriate information seems to be on the player's chart.  The game would probably plays well with families.

Korához képest teljesen rendben levő játék. Nekem a Chinatown jutott róla eszembe, persze ebben semmi csere nincs. Különböző épületeket építenek a játékosok a játék közben is alakuló pályára. Megvan mindnek hogyan hoz pontot. Építeni az adott számú kártyák beadásával lehet, amit köre végén egészít ki 5-re a játékos. Így persze szerencse rendesen van benne, de a játék nem hosszú, így szerintem elviselhető. Nem túl AP veszélyes, de azért kicsit gondolkodós épületépítős játék a Big City.

This is a game that always finds its way onto the table.  Great for gamers and non-gamers alike.  Quite interactive, and beautiful to look at.  Luck is what you make it in this game.  But even if you lose it is so quick that you aren't waiting for it to end.  Plus, at the end of the game it is cool to see the city that you created.  Best with three.

I looove Big City.  It's quite tragic that this went out of print because the bits are gorgeous, and it's a nice quick and light game.  It seems that nearly every game I get screwed over by someone dropping a factory on properties that I'm setting up for a big score; but then again, if I didn't spend so much time building them up for a big score, I could have played there already myself, and I wouldn't have to worry about the factory.  Oh, the decisions!

I am still well-enamored with this game, despite its randomness.  Maybe it has something to do with the fact that in the last two games, other players have inadvertently set me up for shopping centers.

Fun game of hand management and spacial positioning. I've only played one time and we didn't play very efficiently, but it was a lot of fun watching the city develop. Definitely would like to play more. EDIT: Wow, three of us were destroyed. Don't let another player monopolize a neighborhood, play the City Hall in that neighborhood, and then run a street car through it. DESTROYED!

RATING: 8.5
Initial play was with 5, so I'll reserve the rating, as it seemed a little short, such that it was too luck-based and there was not enough time for creating a bit of a strategy.  It seems like this really would be a nice, light and quick kind of game.

UPDATE:  Solid game when not played with 5.  It definitely has some randomness, but long-term strategies often pay off, and any undue bad luck is countered by the relatively quick play time.

After many years of underappreciation, I am finally able to say I am a fan of this game.  The first time I tried it was with five players, which everyone seems to agree is the worst number for the game, and I think I was expecting a longer game that didn't move quite so quickly.  (Also having a rules summary sheet in my own language makes the game immensely more approachable.)  So it was several years before I got around to trying it again.  Now I've played it a couple of times with three players and a couple of times with four players and am looking forward to trying it with two.  It felt like a 45-minute game to me, and with players familiar with the system, I think it could easily be a 30-minute game.  The trick is to keep making something happen on your turn with just a little bit of future planning.  The opportunity cost of future planning is high -- to lay just two streetcar segments, for example, takes an entire turn -- so you can only indulge in it sparingly -- and amongst experienced players, it is not so hard to thwart such planning, though again the cost of doing so can be an entire turn.  Anyway, I'm glad I discovered the game's charms before I traded it away.

RATING: 6
Of course the bits are fantastic, and the idea for the game is neat, but the game play itself just didn't grab me.  I think that's because you can't play any kind of long-term strategy in this game.  As soon as you start planning something, the board changes a lot and your plans are down the tubes.  Note, this isn't happening because other players are trying to intentionally limit your options (I wouldn't mind that so much) but because they are just doing there own thing which inevitably screws you up in some random way.  That got frustrating and I felt like the game just came down to random factors in the end.

RATING: 6.5
[Goldsieber 1999 edition] {City building; drafting, trading, modular-board; optimal 4-5p} {basic 6.5, trading variant 7.0, limited card drawing 7, limited streetcar line, 6.5; single streetcar line 6.5} I got it for the recommendations of my friends. It is a decent family game - thematic, fun, attractive bits, intuitive rules, and interactive. It also provides tactical decisions with some long-term planning. It's enjoyable to look at the final construction of the city at the end of the game.

The 'City Hall' may be a problem for certain players.  Because a City Hall opens space for double points, street cars, neighborhood, etc. many players refuse to build it, afraid to benefit following players. However, with careful planning, building City Hall may earn extra points.  Another way to avoid this problem is to disallow drawing cards from deck that the corresponding tile has not yet built. This will encourage players to build City Hall sooner.

There are several fiddly rules, which the players have to remember. Therefore, the player aids are very important. I prefer more player interaction; therefore, I prefer to the trading variant, although it may have king-making problem. 

The plastic buildings are nicely made. They really enhance game experiences (no more dull tiles :) ).

01 AUG 2009 - Played only as a 2-player so far. It was a blast! Has a small learning curve to understand the requirements for each of the buildings. A little bit of luck helps, but there are also lots of options with the cards you've drawn, plus you can draw from one of several piles of cards which mitigates the luck some as well. Lots of fun, want to play again, esp with more players. It might get chaotic with more than 3, but looking forward to trying...

Big City raised a ruckus in 1999 with its gigantic plastic buildings, and the gameplay is almost relaxing once the rules are understood.  There's an increase in chaos as the number of players rises.  A reprint has been discussed for 5 years now but the design is growing stale; it doesn't warrant the current trader's rate.  Does Big City even need to be BIG anymore?

It played well with both 2 and 3 players, and gave you lots of interesting decisions despite the fairly simple and straightforward rules.  This one should get even better with repeated plays as the types of buildings and scoring becomes second nature, I can't wait to play again.

First impressions of this game were that it was dry, and far too dependent on luck.  Second impressions improved, as I started to see some the elegance in the design, and it stuck with me a couple of days after playing it.  After the third play, I realized that the randomness was only a small factor of the game.  Though the neighborhoods come out in a semi-random fashion (the fact that players place sections in turn may be chaotic, but I don't consider that aspect of it random), and though the cards are random, as well, knowing when to pick from which stack of cards, based on what's in play, where you've played, and where other people have played, is the key to the game.

First of all, I think this game deserves a higher rating here on BGG. This is a fun, relatively light game with gorgeous components. The game resolves mainly around card management and proper timing of your build actions. It plays with 2-5 player, but I think that it plays best with 2-3. With more than 3 it becomes (too) chaotic. With 2 it's more tactical.

Good, low-complexity game.  I like seeing things getting built, so it really appeals to me thematically.    When playing with serious (stubborn?) gamers, often use a house rule granting 5 points for playing city hall.  Had a game where no one was willing to play city hall and give the rest of the table the advantage of playing the specials, so the game ended very quickly without city hall ever being played.

Een luchtig spelletje, waarbij iedereen aan een steeds groter wordende stad bouwt. Bijna ieder stuk stad levert punten op, maar kijk uit dat je grondgebied niet minder waard wordt door energiecentrales.

Een speler verzamelt rechten op bepaalde stukken grond en als hij een groot genoeg aaneengesloten stuk grond heeft mag hij daar op bouwen. Dit kan een woonwijk of kantorencomplex zijn. Maar ook speciale gebouwen als een theater, kerk en stadhuis kunnen gebouwd worden, maar moeten wel voldoen aan voorwaarden. En dan moeten de spelers ook nog eens een openbaarvervoersnet aanleggen. Oftewel genoeg te doen, maar toch vrij simpel.

A truly entertaining game experience. Tactile and strategic. A good deal of crisis management in response to other players' moves. Great feeling if you finally manage to place one of the higher value buildings. Fab game for both gamers and non-gamers. At the end of the game, do a fly-by movie on your phone of the city you have built :)

(TRADE Interest: low) haven't played it enough for a real rating.  it seems "okay" so far, but we didn't really know what we were doing.

RATING: 6.5
pleasant "tile-laying" game where the tiles are actually cool plastic buildings... But there isn't much game thinking in there, just random pleasantness for 2-3 players or random chaos for more... Cool bits, ok game

Beautiful components, nice rules and interesting interaction, but a real bear to set up and put away -- so much so that it knocks .5 or so off the rating.

A nice game about city planning. It is not a heavy gamer&#039;s game, but rather a nice appetizer. A pleasant way to kill an hour. Has great bits too, of course.

Feeling slightly underwhelmed by the experience after being hyped by the fact that it's an OOP and a highly sought after title.  Lite on the strategy and high on the randomness, it's really hard to get anything going if you don't draw the right neighborhood cards.  Although I don't mind the luck in the game, I can see it being extremely frustrating if you keep getting hosed by the park and factory placements unintentionally (but could also be very satisfying when you screw up the right person).  I do have to admit it was fun when a plan does come together getting to build the lucrative shopping mall and the church and snatching a come from behind win.  I would say that Big City is one of those games where the chaotic element is part of what makes it enjoyable to play.  With the appropriate expectation, I think I may come to appreciate this more in the future.

Love the bits...like the game.  Somewhat tactical, somewhat lucky.  You lose control the more players you have, which is not a good thing.

Muy buen juego. Recuerda a las entraÃ±ables partidas de Sim city original. HabrÃ¡ que estar atentos a la re-ediciÃ³n de Valley Games.

Interesting game of jockeying for position for maximal scoring, without helping your opponents too much.  It was sort of like a negotiation-free Chinatown crossed with Medina and Sim City.

RATING: 6
A very light game with a little too much randomness in it.  The saving grace is the quality of the bits and the enjoyable finished product once the city is built

RATING: 2
Wanted to like this one, but I can't.  The character cards are not at all balanced, and this leads to the player that draws better cards early to completely run away with it. If you draw a lot of the "famous" knights, you win, congrats.  Components are nice, art is good, theme is great, game is horrible.

RATING: 6.75
I'm unsure what to think of this. In some ways, it seems like it is a weak game -- and in others, very strong.

More plays are needed, but after three plays, I will cogitate on my experiences with this and hope it sees the table again soon.

RATING: 4
Probably the most complete King Arthur game.  Everyone from the legends is here and they have unique special powers that reflect their characteristics.

Too bad the game itself is a mundane number crunching process.

What this game really needs is to be extensively revamped using some modern ideas like those found in Race for the Galaxy, Glory to Rome, or even the designer's more recent Core Worlds.  Give me a tableau or three of knights that I can send on quests.  Give me interesting combo opportunities.  Just ensure the game keeps its unique flavor.

I'm late to the party at Camelot, and I wish I wasn't! Why didn't I pick this up years ago? 

Camelot Legends is a shining pommel-gem with an intricate scabbard to boot. The mechanics and theme mesh beautifully. It's visually appealing, wonderfully atmospheric, and for some reason (alas) woefully underrated on BGG. The love and lore-care in this design is palpable.

It also plays MUCH better with two players than I anticipated. I eagerly await many further plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
If you are at all a King Arthur fan then this game should appeal to you. The artwork on the cards is really nice. Cards represent all the characters and there are a lot of them. A little fiddly with all the bonuses and penalties that the cards apply to the card interaction (combat) but overall a pretty good game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
After several playings I have grown to dislike this game. At first it is very appealing because the Camelot theme is so rich and detailed (it's obvious this game was built around the theme). However, the consensus our group has come to is that the game is too complex for its own good, as every single card has a unique ability. This becomes annoying when you have to constantly be aware of not only all of your characters, but also all of your opponents characters and any events that are on the table. Now, this could make for a very interesting game with a lot of desicions, and in a way it does to a limited extent, but the rest of the game just doesn't warrant this complexity. Also, I think alot of a player's chance of winning can come down to luck of the draw, especially with the Knights with a dagger symbol, who can destroy other Knights at the same location, and also with drawing the right Event card that you can complete. 
It almost pains me to not like this game, because as I say, the theme is rich and very well done, but actually playing the game has become a chore.
However, if you love Aurthurian legend, I would suggest looking into this game just based on the excellent handling of the theme.

I've owned this for almost 8 years, and finally played it for the first time.  We're having a lot of fun with this one, as my son is about halfway through Le Morte D'Arthur, I just finished Tolkien's "The Fall of Arthur," and my daughter has a violent attachment to Lancelot.  It's a really good game, with great artwork and theme.  It would be even better with extra event cards to cycle in randomly, so we have less idea what to expect in each game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
Every card's a "special" with lots of teeny-tiny text in this coma-inducing horror. (Additionally, the cards are so thick you can't shuffle them normally.) Might have been okay with 20% special cards and four character traits instead of six.

Very positive thoughts on this after 1 play. A good combination of hand management and special card abilities. Will have to play with more than 2 next time. Spouse didn't like the game, however. Game is pretty good with 3, but not as good. 3 players makes the game too chaotic, IMO. There is a good, CCG feel to this game that I like. And no buying boosters!!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A lot of fun to play---the mechanics are better than I expected, and the theme makes this a welcome addition to the collection.  The game has moderate replay value, and the theme is great.  
  
I keep this game around because it's so rich in theme---and it's very well researched, which gives the characters and events extra depth.  It has a lot of CCG characteristics, but through a shared deck, so that nobody has go through a learning curve with a particular deck strategy.  Plus it is a little bit like leading an Arthurian RPG group of players around, since your characters are your "team" that you're moving to three separate locations to complete quests and so on.  This adds a charming dimension, the likes of which you can also find in MeCCG.

Interesting card game with a lot of room for great tactical play. Pretty steep learning curve due to the large amount of text on the cards. Great replay value build in the system. Pretty large luck factor in the cards you receive as there are a great big bunch of avarage cards and soem really good ones. If the good ones are mostly with 1 or two players the others are without a chance.

I like the CCG-type of game that is non collectable. Only played two player games but found the counting not such a chore as others mention here. Perhaps that issue only arrises in 3 and 4 player games. Game can be taught in a few minutes and it's different every time. Wished the theme were felt a little more throughout the game but I've seen that I'm so focused on getting the numbers that I need that theme or story is the last thing I'm thinking about. Good game that can be played in around an hour in a 2 player game. It will get some play for being a good game in this genre but not a great game - not a Race for the Galaxy or even San Juan but still good.

After one play of the basic version I'm left wondering whether the introduction of the advanced cards would take it to the next level, or just complicate proceedings. Still, enjoyed the basic version enough to want to try it again, so we'll keep it at a 7 for now...

The Forest, the swamps, they all have adventure! 

This is fun card game that is easy to play, but changes rapidly.  The first couple times you play it, you get to know the characters which live on the cards.  Each character/card has powers or strengths in 6 different areas.  

Make a band of knights with various powers in the 6 areas that you feel can take on a particular quest and send them after various quests(events) worth various VPs.  This game is absolutely lovely in appearance and feel.  

Takes about 45 minutes or an hour (if you really work to your max)

In spite of how easy this game is, you never can predict how it will turn out.  You never know how the tide will turn toward another King's company.

Nice components and theme but the game didn't play as well as I expected. We spend a lot of time without any events on the table which made the game really dull. I think I'm not going to play the game again unless someone really can convince me we've played the game wrong somehow.

By Buying Camelot Legends you bring home a wonderful set of well-drawn cards. Each of the Round Table tale character is in the game with his own card: the fidelty to the original legend is total. The problem lies in the game structure, a little confusing a usually quite slow. Most of the matches are not that fun and may become a little too much long, revealing a boring structure for the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Each card holds lots of tiny text, which would be acceptable if necessary, but it's verbose and even squeezes in flavour text.  Unfortunately it's important to know the abilities of the cards in play, but there can be so many, with most being either too far away or stacked below other cards that keeping track of the tiny text was painful to the point that practically no abilities were ever used by anyone.

The game feels like it may be quite good with improved cards, but currently its not one I'd like to play again.

Way too much information on the cards.  It takes half of the game just reading cards and trying to find all the symbols on the cards and what they're for!

This game was well received by myself and the other two players. For me it wasn't outstanding though. There is a fair bit of luck. Then again it is partly a card game. I guess for me the first game had some mystery as to how things worked but after some contemplation I'm not sure there were or would ever be many tough decisions. But having said that, there were some decisions to be made and I do look forward to playing it again.

Wow!  I am really enjoying this game.  The theme is spectacular if you like the Knight of the Round Table genre.  Where I have never played a game like this one, I'm sure there are others.  2-player games only, so far.  Needs more than just 17 events or the game ends too quickly.  Just as you've built a decent company, POW, it's over.  Feels like a little something is missing, like roving NPC enemies or static location hazards/skill checks, in addition to the events.

First off, I'm a sucker for theme.  This one has plenty.  However, it was just too difficult to read all the cards and figure out the interactions and best plays. It really hampered play for us. I think the rating could go up with more plays as a I become more familar with the cards.  One thing though, a game like this makes me truly appreciative of the genius of a game like Magic: The Gathering.

Fun to play with teenagers in front of the fireplace on a snowy day. Lacks an adequate board, in order to keep it compact I guess. You need to study the cards if you are going to realize their potential. We expected there would be expansions and perhaps a deluxe edition eventually, but it never really took off I suppose. Still enough of a challenge and just enough competition to make it worth playing, again and again.

This is a decent game, but you need to be in the mood to do a lot of mental addition.  This game is an example of the proper way to have basic, intermediate, and expert game levels.  The rules are essentially the same across all the levels, but the cards are marked so you can mix in the more advanced ones as you gain comfort with the game.  This was a nice way for them to set it up, as the game is slow until you get a little familiarity with the cards.  Ultimately traded away, as I found it just a little too much work for too little fun.

The game has been traded and never been played.

Update:

Played once. Game was OK. Lots of text on cards. Takes a while to read and re-read them. Beautiful artwork on cards. Mechanic was interesting. Took a while to understand how the game worked.

There wasn't that much interaction between players. For that, I was a little disappointed. It was a 2 player game. Wonder how a 3 or 4 player would of been different.

I would like it give it another try. If it was a little more simpler, it would be been more popular in my opinion. Shields look alike, so brings downtime along with all the text reading. Would be simpler if instead of shields it was different colors instead.

Game can be interesting if you don't mind reading and re-reading the cards. Group of gamers who does that might find this game very enjoyable and clever.

If you dislike reading a lot of text on cards, this game isn't for you.

TRADED.

An interesting card game, CCG style cards, dripping with theme and fantastic graphics. Significant but not unreasonable amount of stat counting ([url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/342940]using counters or chips[/url] alleviates much of this problem), and some luck, but repeated play and being familiar with the cards is  rewarding.  Need more play with advanced cards to determine how much of game there is in here, but initial impressions are positive.  Probably appeals most to fans of the Arthurian tales, and is most fun when players are willing to get into character by role-playing.
Still need to try the Lords of Camelot variant also.

Definitely a game geared toward former CCGers, this is a game that easily would've been made into a CCG several years ago.

I think four players would be the way to go, but there would be a lot of chaos involved.  I only wish there were more ways to screw with your opponent--the characters who can disrupt your opponent's plans seem few and far between.

I like the random event deck, though--meaning games will stay more fresh from game to game.

Players have complained about the amount of text on each character, but if you're a CCG player, Camelot Legends has less text than you'd need to remember for any of those.  Try before you buy, we enjoyed this enough to make sure it gets a few plays.  I would rate this much higher if it had maybe one fewer stat to track and more ways of directly interacting with your opponent.

It definitely has a "Star Trek CCG" vibe to it--moving people around with certain skills/stats so you can 'complete missions' and score points.  While that was a flat busted game because there were too many broken cards in the mix, Star Trek did have the advantage because you could just park your ships next to your opponent and open fire on him.  Hell, this is how I played every game of Star Trek CCG, with five Klingon ships blowing everything to bits and pieces.

Uh...anyway...yeah, if it were easier to stabby stab Lancelot who kept eating up all the quests, that would be perfect.

I really like this game, and with less luck it would have probably gone up to 9.5/10. Don't give up after your first game, you need few games to fully understand the strategy and the game is much better with the blue and red cards.

once the initial absorbtion of icons, and card powers is digested this little card game presents a fun and fairly quick playing game.  Avoid the basic rules, they are not really needed, even in learning (except for maybe a solo run through).  The game has a lot of nice flavor, and really emotes Arturian lore.

I love this game. Light enough for a quick filler and with enough strategy to feel like you accomplished something in the end. Heavily luck-of-the-draw dependent. 
And you will be doing a lot of counting stats but doesn't feel like too much. I look forward to moving into advanced to add more variety.

It’s a quite charming game, but I don’t think it is my kind of game. It is the kind of game where you have to learn about the cards and how they interact in order to play well. Otherwise it is highly tactical and you do what is best during this turn. I quite like it, but not enough for it to be really worth the effort and time to dig into it.

The game should play well with its simple rules, supported by a rich theme and beautiful artwork. You mainly play character cards to different locations, forming companies to fulfill quests by adding the values of one or two of six different stats. Occasionally, you also deal with special events. The problem is that it is extremely hard to keep track of all card powers, modifiers and interactions, not to mention the useless iconography that you have to constantly check on a reference sheet. Every card has special power text, and even with reminder tokens (not provided), it's still a bit of a chore. There are also imbalance issues: for example, with only two actions per turn, the quest that grants an extra action every turn can easily decide the game if completed early.

Whoa!  There is a LOT to think about and keep track of in this game and it can be a little over whelming for a new player but it is a FUN game.  One of the hardest things is keeping straight all of the text abilities on the cards. The bonuses and special powers of the different characters is what really makes the game.  We just played the basic game and there are 2 more levels of complexity.  One thing I saw here on BGG was using the tokens from "Risk" to help keep track of increased abilities, and that would help.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
A solid "like" based on an initial play.  [Skipped the Basic game . . . as it looked fairly remedial.  Played the Standard game, and it worked well.  The Advanced cards seemed like overkill on the complexity, but we might work them into the mix in time.]

Definitely want to give it another go.  First impression is that it is a really neat "cards with text" game where there is a lot of potential for interesting interaction between the cards.  However, like many other games in this genre, the game may not be long enough to truly engineer the use of a lot of the text abilities if you don't happen to draw the 'right' other cards at the same time.

So . . . I feel like there are smart decisions to be made during the game, but that for all the neat card text, you are likely to be playing more tactically than strategically.

Played one game, standard version with 3 players. The cards are very attractive but they can't really be appreciated during a game as you don't have much time to admire the artwork and read the quotes. This first game seemed a little simplistic, but I assume that using the full deck and with some experience playing the game it will become more involved. My initial impression is that this could be a very satisfying game for players interested in the King Arthur myth and who have at least a reasonable knowledge of the cards.

Set collection over six variables. The cards have LOTS of special abilities, which is probably going to be daunting the first time I play.

Camelot Legends is a beautifully produced card game that's extremely true to the Arthurian mythos. There's also an interesting and elegant game system at the heart of everything. However, there's so much variety among the CCG-like game cards, and you have so many of them out at the same time that the complexity ultimately obfuscates and detracts from the elegant game system. It's generally recommended for Arthurian enthusiasts and serious CCG players, but others will probably find it overwhelming and/or too hard to play.

This is a distribution game with very good card art.  The way the events work may make the game a bit random, but I am glad to own it.  It plays quite well (in some ways best) as a two-player game.  Great Arthurian flavor.

Interesting idea, but I found it ultimately uninspiring. So many numbers to look at, and every single character has special power text that has to be read to see if it impacts the quest. It seemed like far more work than was called for in a middle-depth game.

I have only played Camelot Legends once and only with the basic rules. I remember I liked it but I wasn’t impressed. I want to play it again with the full rules this time but a friend has my copy of the game :(.

The art is very well done although the cards seem a little crowed with all that info on them.

I’m downgrading it to a 5.0 rating as I felt the game was average, but I will play it again and re rate accordingly.

There are few games that capture my enthusiasm for multiple plays, this is one.  It was great to be able to play strategically right from the get-go since the beginner level incorporated a manageable amount of info and characters to reckon with.  The ability to move to more advanced levels as familiarity increases to keep it challenging is a great plus.  The artwork is fantastic, particularly the overall balance and harmony of the card layout.  Rules are straightforward.  There is a great sense of humor between the lines.  The characters powers seem consistent enough with the legend characters to bring additional continuity.  My only beef is that the art for the ability icons is not unique enough across the different abilities.  They look so similar in form and meaning that its difficult to distinguish them particulary up front.  The glowing colors behind the icons helps but is not quite enough.  Overall I loved the game, have played it many times and plan to play it many more.  I would recommend this game highly.

[b]Thoughts after one play:[/b] Iconography is awful and the sheer number of "abilities" really slows things down.  You often find yourself having to check what shield icon a card is referring to, or adding stats over and over again. The game is still fun, despite those issues.

I am worried it won't have a lot of replayability. I hope that it will, so we will learn some of the card text, rather than squinting all night again. The cards are beautiful, the theme is fun, the gameplay is simple. I think some gamers who take themselves very seriously will scoff, but this is something that can be fun. But it is a headache having to read and re-read the text on every card in play and every card in your hand, and the endless re-tallying of attribute scores gets to be a drag. We never got around to trying the advanced rules before trading this away.

As to now, only played once a two player game. It is a card game and does not take too long.

Arthurian games tend to score low among boardgame players.  The perfect game on Arthur is yet to be found.  This looks like a winner from the components themselves.  A lot of colors and nice subsystem.  It has Romance factor for characters in the game as well! I like the mysticisim and symbolism of the era very much - horoscopic details and stories in one package.  

The story-telling aspect of the game is quite good - in that players move/ wander his controlled characters (or company of a maximum 6) from place to place looking for challenges (a.k.a. location events) and meet them successfully by mustering the required ability scores (from 6 to 18) from the company.  By combining the ability scores that equal or exceed the requirements, you complete the event and score the vicotry points ranging from 1 to 6 for the events.  The players with the most scores win the game.  

There are three locations in the game - Perilous Forest, Cornwall and after all, Camelot itsef.  Each player will get 5 starting characters in hand and is the hand limit size too.  Some events would only worth 2 victory points like Mystic Temptation, while slaying a dragon earns you 7VPs.  The events require different abilities to complete - combat, diplomacy, adventure, cunning, chivalry and pysche.  Naturally, if you are familiar with the characters in the legend, these scores are assigned a value according to their respective developments and encounters in the fiction.          

In a turn, the player can perform two out three possible action and the same action can be performed twice.  You can draw or play a character card or you can move 1 or 2 characters from one location to another. The company should always move and end their movement together.  Most of the events are location specific and hence it is a choice whether you spread out your companies to three locations or focus your company strength in one location, ripping the next upcoming event in the location.  

All the cards in the game are beautifully illustrated, giving a full and rich atmosphere to the game.  The ame has Romance factor for characters in the game as well with the use of card text on the characters, extending the mysticisim, symbolism and horoscopic (read tarot) details of the era very much.  

For example, Princess Guinevere add +1 to a single ability score of one knight.  However, that knight has to be discarded at the end of the turn after receiving the boost from her.  On the other hand, Sir Lancelot works best when he is with Guinevere - all his ability +1 when he is with Guinevere. So naturally you would always want the two at the same location and moving them together if they are both controlled by you.  Tristan +1 combat in Cornwall or at any other location with Isolde.  In another example, Morgan le Fay, the very female who can seduce any knight (male, there is no female knight in the game) in another company at the same location coming over to join her own, if the knight's pysche score is lower than Morgan le Fay.  The knight is discarded at the end of the turn.               

It is therefore these relationships among all the characters that made the game authentic to the original story.  At the same time, it is also these very special card text dictating how does the game go generally.  You have to find x and y in order to complete event z, that sort of thing.  The competitive element, while it is there, is never competitive enough in the game if you are looking for that specific game element.  Some people would find it comfortable, but for the more competitive wargamer, it is not likely a choice for game very often.  The High King special card (bonus action i.e. 3 actions) in Camelot, the knight alligenance ditated by the card text effects, and the two remaining special cards (Excalibur and Love Potion) spice up the game flavor a bit but I thought they were too powerful, especially towards the end of the game.  

Overall, not a bad game but after while, it is still a random, mathematical minimax game disguised as a playable card game with a strong theme.  If you are into the Camelot world, this game is for you.  If you don't care about the Camelot, any other card game of similar nature would have satisfied you the same already. The perfect game/ holy grail on Arthur has yet to be found for a wargamer.

Arthurian games are always a hit with me, and this one is quite interesting in that it portrays several minor characters of the stories. A nice, solid game.

Really enjoy this game.  Some strategic choices and the theme feels like a labor of love by the designer.  Not the quickest game to play due to the wording on the cards, somewhat vague symbols, and the need to check for various card effects, but those minor negatives don't detract much from the overall positive gaming experience.

A very good card game.  Simple rules, easy to teach, somewhat complex in execution (which is a good thing - under several replayes the game becomes more rich, flavorful and exciting).  Defininitley worth the cost!  Play one basic one time then jump directly to the advanced game.  All the difference in the world.  Works well with 2!  Can't say enough!  Beautiful to look at!!!  Especially fun if you know and like Arthurian stories.

Artwork and design of cards is stunning.  No cartoony images or goofy flavor text to detract from the rich theme.  Mechanics are simple and straightforward, but since every character card contains text, card interactions can result in complex and very interesting gameplay.  UPDATE: Lowered my rating after several plays.  I just don't have the patience to re-calculate my abilities and squint at the text on all the cards layed out on the table.  Tedious is the word that comes to mind.UPDATE: Traded 2/05 for Settlers of Catan

This is a very fun game, that moves along at a good pace, gas enough extra cards not in play in any given game that no two games will ever feel alike, and has very rich card interactions.  A lot of take that involved, but at a manageable level.

RPG review by SHanon Apelcline has the following unfavorable comments:

"Overall, throughout the game I had a lot of trouble figuring out which of my cards could do which things. I also constantly lost track of what my opponent's cards could do and they lost track of mine. I think a lot of work could have been done with iconography to make cards even more obvious and easy to use. To a certain extent this is a natural problem when you have 100 different cards, and literally every card has different powers. However, it still does remain a barrier to play, and I suspect it would be a lot of games before I had a good, intuitive grasp on most of the cards in the game. In no ways is this a gamebreaker, but it does obfuscate the game's play somewhat. "

"Camelot Legends is ultimately a Collectible Card game in a non-collectible package. It's pretty easy to imagine a slight variant of the game where each player is building from their own deck of characters. The uniqueness of the individual cards is pretty common for a CCG, but I think Camelot Legends actually overdoes this aspect. Each card has a lot of text, and most cards have no icons, bold-faced phrases, or other methods to help you keep track of what they can do. Thus on the face of the cards themselves Camelot Legends is a lot more complex than most CCGs. This problem is also more relevent because you have a fair number of cards out, and they're scattered across the whole table. I'm going to talk more about this in The Game Design, but here it's worth pointing out just as a difference from most CCGs."

"Unfortunately I ran into problems with how the game actually played. The core problem is, inevitably, what I've described a few times: the huge variability of the cards, and the fact that there's no good way to keep track of what does what. I'm really tempted to fudge this and say, "but CCGers will be more used to this type of complexity," or "the complexity will eventually be resolved through continued play." However, I think that ignores what's a real problem."

"Camelot Legends is a beautifully produced card game that's extremely true to the Arthurian mythos. There's also an interesting and elegant game system at the heart of everything. However, there's so much variety among the CCG-like game cards, and you have so many of them out at the same time that the complexity ultimately obfuscates and detracts from the elegant game system. It's generally recommended for Arthurian enthusiasts and serious CCG players, but others will probably find it overwhelming and/or too hard to play."

I was a playtester for this game, and expected to be tired of it by now. I was wrong. This game is fairly simple to learn  (especially if you are not an analysis paralysis sufferer), and offers complexity (and replay value) in the many possible combinations of events and characters. The artistry (both visual and literary) of the game are nothing short of masterful. And just when you think you've got the game mastered, a card combo you've never seen beats you back into humility (a knightly virtue, to be sure). Fun the first time, more fun thereafter.

Just played for the first time. Played a two-player game. The special abilities of the cards and ability to move the cards to different locations make a very interesting game. Artwork is great and components are well made.

If you're not a fan of CCG's but like the variety of strategies that card games offer, then this is a game you should give a try. This is a very enjoyable card game.

A side note: The text on the cards is pretty small which may bother some. I didn't find it a problem. This is also a game where you have to be a bit focused on the special abilities of your cards and at least aware of your opponents special abilities.

RATING: 7.5
Rating based on plays with the beginner rules. 

Very interesting cardgame, although the luck factor is pretty high with the beginner rules. After reading through the standard rules, I can already tell this will greatly reduce the luck factor with the cap on total events per location and the rule that says you can only claim one event at a location per turn. I anticipate this rating to go up.

The cards have great art and are very thematic, but they're not very clear. The ability icons all look the same and the text on the cards references abilities and allegiances by name instead of by the icons.

Huh. Played once, felt like I had no control of the game and was losing throughout, then suddenly won when I was able to beat the final event. Dunno, maybe there's more here than initially meets the eye, but I wasn't too impressed by first play.

05/27/07 Played a three player game, once. The tiny, dense text gave me eyestrain. To call the cards "busy" would be an understatement.  The ample theme (usually a big plus) and nice art work did little to offset the tedious game play. There is little fun, its more like work as you try to keep track of the special abilities of 20 plus cards on the table at once. I have no desire to ever see Camelot Legends again. 08/02/08 Got roped into another game (using the Lords of Camelot variant this time). My opinion didn't change.

Just one play. I think there is a good game here, but playability is hindered by too much texts on the cards. Knowing and remembering your own card's text is one, but you also have to keep an eye on your competitors' cards with special abilities. Not so accessible.

I bought this game when it first came out and my wife and I really loved the theme.  I play it mainly with her.  We've had a lot of fun with it but it IS a very heavy text driven card game and you really do need to become comfortable with the cards.  We've put a lot of time into it and it's a decent game we both love to play.

Does not inspire much in the way of table talk, and I find that disconcerting to some degree.  Otherwise I think the theme is dripping from this game, the mechanics are easy to grasp, rules well written and organized, and easy to play from turn to turn. Our only stalling point comes from the "final" event cards and how they can stop the game completely, or stall indefinitely as players try to find the right combination of cards. A lot going on in a very small package.

OK CCG style game which struggles to find its way to the table. Different levels of play (beginner, standard, advanced) is a nice way to slowly learn the game.

With 4 players, can be tricky for all players to read the card text. This is not a problem with 2 (or 3) if you position the boards well.

Well themed, with nice quality card art. Card stock is great too (although white borders would have been better).

Some of the bonuses can be a little tricky to keep track of, but in the beginner game this isn't much of an issue (and the beginner game is very playable).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It isn't a bad game, but it would be better if it were simpler.  In a three player game there will be a dozen cards out with tiny text giving everything a special power.  (Cards will have one orientation per player, too.)  Some of the powers are in constant use, others are once only (and hence easier to forget).  The skill icons are often hard to tell apart due to fine detail and colour reuse.  The skill icons have little to do with some of the skills and the card text uses the power names.  (Similar issue with heraldry.)  It would have been a lot better if most cards had no power and there was a simple bonus for using several people from the same allegiance, saving special powers for women, kings and maybe non-allied people.  The High King card was rather powerful when somone got it early.  Why are all the non-allied characters bastards?  (Bar sinister.)

I'll admit it...I was suckered into this game by the theme and the cheap price, but BOY was I suckered!  The game consists of dozens and dozens of cards, each with their own special powers and each with SIX different attributes.  Then you proceed to put all of these different cards in three areas of battle, where you then have to keep straight not only your own cards' powers and attributes, but everyone else's at the table!  The theme is attractive and the production value of the cards is superb, but any game that garners as much discussion and variants about how to keep track of all the information while playing as this title has should send up a red flag regarding its playability.  A real clunker.

Well, I've played my 3rd game of this, and can truly say it's a fun ride.  I think you will have more fun if you are a fan of Arthurian legend (I am), or just knights going on quests and being chivalrous (I am). But I've played this with a buddy of mine and our 2 sons (12 year olds), and everybody got into it and had fun.

Yes, there is a luck factor in the game, but it's not overbearing by any means.  Plenty of excitement in the game (twists & turns), based on events and character powers.  You could concievably get the brunt of people attacking you, but it seemed pretty well distributed in our games.  Definitely need to play with the "Lords of Camelot" variant.

I like that I can easily fall into the "thematic" story of the game and have fun with it win or lose.


The only cons are that reading the card text is difficult from seated distance, so you will need to occasionaly pick up cards to read them.  Also tracking ability modifiers can be tricky.  But that's why I picked up mini dice in 6 colors to assist with this, and they work quite well.

Decent recipe fulfillment game. If I hadn't played the Hogwarts House Cup game, also from Andrew Parks, I would enjoy this game more than I do. The theme is really all that sets this one apart. It's a shame the various characters and their stats aren't used in a deeper game.

The game bogs down mid-game for me with all the number crunching and the flavour text which modifies the number crunching but must be continually re-read.

It's a shame, as it's a game that has nice ideas and nice game play and I wanted to like it more.

Does capture the ambiance of Arthurian legend. The art work on the cards is spectacular. The cards match the characters and have good commentary.
It is a trick taking game with lots of open tricks, the special abilities of the cards are crucial. Like how you see if you can capture the "trick" before making your play, gives a nice flavor of others perhaps to make a response.
It takes time to read the cards and understand the impact of the abilities. This coupled with calculations to see how you can capture the quest could lead to analysis paralysis.

The most Camelot-y of any game I've played (including Shadows Over Camelot).  I love how it incorporates every main character and tons of minor ones.  But it also requires that players learn what all the cards do and how they interact which can take a few games to get a grasp of.

A friend let me borrow this to see how the mechanics worked, and I found that it has artwork by my favorite artist: Melissa Benson. Played a 3-handed game by myself, ended up trading him for it, as I also love Arthurian legends, but haven't played with others yet.

I'll rate it after I've played this.

RATING: 6
Always have been a fan of Arthurian legend. Gameplay seemed easy, despite a lot of arithmetic to determine if one can meet certain goals.  I expected it to be a bit more cutthroat, but found the challenge is more in managing your own cards and getting what you need to have in place to obtain a goal before your opponent does the same.

Based on two plays. Didn't really "take" yet. Art and text are interesting but the game seemed very random and any strategy was mostly reactive. One problem for me was the density of card text, varity of card attributes card facings and the wide distribution of cards between fields and side quests made it difficult to even approximate the values of players' companies.

Excellent card game, reminiscent of CCG's.  It has everything most card games have: the luck of the draw.  Yet once past that the game offers players some difficult choices.    
Each game is different depending on the characters and events drawn, which adds to the replayability.  The theme is woven throughout, and the art is for the most part superb. 
Some have said that there is too much to keep track of, but I don't find this to be true.  The game offers easy to see symbols when a card can negatively effect others' characters, and it's rather easy to quickly determine whether or not your opponents are anywhere close to completing an event.   

To maintain balance, you must play with the Lords of Camelot official variant.

--Dec2010-- I'd almost forgot about this one.  It lacks the clarity that one wants in a game.  Our attempt was dominated by the looking up of concepts in the rules.  There wasn't enough information on the cards to play cleanly.   Now that isn't to say the game is without merit:  there appeared to be a delightful Arthurian theme.  Still, it was difficult to transcend the game interface in order to experience it:  We mostly saw a very mechanical "I'll play this card here... If, um, the rules permit.  Let me check."

RATING: 5
Oh, how I wanted to like this game.  And it's not terrible, but it suffers from a few serious problems.  It aspires to be like Magic: the Gathering in a contained environment, but a) every single card is different, b) the cards are oriented in a different direction on the table for each player, and c) unlike most Magic cards, the text is teeny-tiny, unreadable from across the table.  As such, it becomes nigh-impossible to keep track of everything on the board that might interact with something else.  

Combine this with less-than-rigorous rules that leave numerous card interactions up to a coin flip, and a constant tedious adding up of numbers over and over again, and the game falls down from a playability standpoint.  

On the plus side, the production values are top notch, and there are interesting decisions to be made throughout the game.

Bought this game because of the theme and to at least try a card game. So for the new experience.

Components, graphically are very nice,but are too small.
This game deserves and NEEDS everything larger.

Especially the text on cards which is microscopic and neigh impossible to read. What a shame.
As is it's unplayable for someone with my esysight and I can imagine that others may struggle so much they can't be bothered.
Am planning to 'one day' copy it all and create larger cards etc.....  one day.....

So gameplay still awaits me finding time to do that.

RATING: 6.75
This is a simple card game wherein players compete to complete events by assembling a company of knights.  The resolution mechanic is one of simple math, adding values together as indicated by an icon, yet knights grant a variety of bonuses, and some cards allow for interference with your opponent(s).  A further dynamic as added in that you never play with all the events, so no two games are alike.

There is a subtle strategy to this game, which saves it from being a purely educational game by way of learning how to add numbers.  Some events call for you to bid, some add a bonus to certain heraldic knights, and others are simply events to complete.  The player interaction is low, and apart from a couple of events it's always obvious when a player can interfere.

On each turn a player must decide if they are going to move knights to a new location, play a knight from their hand into a location, or draw a knight from the draw deck.  Each player only gets two actions, and since they are all racing to complete the events first (for therein lie the victory points) there is tension in deciding what to do on your turn.

I am not generally a big fan of games wherein cards are played to change the ability of other cards, but this one appealed to me.<BR><BR>I really like the theme and the artwork and the idea of completing quests in the setting of Arthurian legends is great.  Gameplay is novel and exciting.<BR><BR>I do have a couple of quibbles with the game.  There are a couple of rules that are tough to decipher (although the game's creator is very quick to answer any questions by email!)  In addition, while the artwork on the cards is very nice, the information on the cards can be hard to decipher.  I have a hard time tracking what special effects are in play from what cards through the course of the game.<BR><BR>All in all, though, the game is fun to play and exciting to explore and the "rewrites" of history made during the play of the game is a lot of fun, such as Sir Mordred as High King, and Sir Kay wielding Excalibur!<BR>Since introducing this game to the rest of the family (it had mainly been getting play by me and my 11 year old...) it has become a huge hit.  We play with great regularity, logging some 30 games in 2-3 weeks.

Great art, wonderful research, this game really captures much of the feel of all of your favorite (and least favorite) knights running around on quests.  

Sadly though, this game is ultimately just a bunch of crap on a bunch of cards and you just build up the stats in each group trying to reach some arbitrary numbers (calculate/recalculate/then count them up again).  

I also have a problem with the attribute shields, they are just too similar looking and not all that evocative.  If I was 16 I probably would have liked this more, but now I just don't have patience for games where I have to monitor the text of 40 different cards at once.  This just ends up taking too long rereading cards and recalculating numbers.

Huge disappointment. This game looks lovely, with a reliable theme and some superb art (of the high middle ages type, rather than gritty Anglo-Romans) and has clearly been worked on by a keen designer. I also like the game company's ethos. But the game is so thin, it cannot keep the attention. It is essentially a number comparison game, with no clever twists. Variety is provided by card effects and a curious bidding system. We have seen it all before, and there is nothing radical or appealing here. Expensive, too, in the UK at £18 (like all the Z-Man games). It fits into the same category of Gangland and Airlines - I will keep the cards until a game system comes along to do them justice. 

PS I do not understand the reviews and ratings for this game. I know that everyone here has different tastes, but I cannot see where the appeal might be in this one.

An decent game that is hindered by many poor graphic design choices.

A 2nd edition w/ the following improvements would greatly enhance my enjoyment of the game.

- Instead of using the words Chivalry, etc in the card ability text use the symbol so you don't have to keep referring to the cheat sheet.  It's what I hated about Hera and Zeus too which is a good game, but I traded it away out of frustration.  It would also help because at a glance you could see which cards in your display and company can have an effect for that symbol

- Change the symbols to be shapes or something and make the color border larger.  *VERY* hard to tell the difference between all the shields.

- Put the name of the allegiance w/ the banner so you don't have to check the manual.

- Mark which cards are "Lords".  I know this was a variant released after the final game, but would be nice to have.

Not much to it. Draw events and place on appropriate location, then resolve adjustments to attributes and then see if you meet the event requirements which basically determines if your required attribute is equal or higher than the ones listed on the event cards. Then draw, place or move current character cards to new locations. keep follwing the order till no event cards are left on locations. Most cards give special abbilities and adjustments to your characters either immediately or after the event is won.

Not that the rules itself were hard, but becoming familiar with each card's details, can be daunting to a new player, especially playing with veterans.

The art is very well done. A very pretty game that plays a lot like a CCG.

The tales of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table have inspired artists, scholars, and dreamers for over a thousand years. Now you can relive the legends of Camelot by sending powerful knights to mysterious lands in order to accomplish the world's greatest adventures!
\13\ \13\
Camelot Legends is a fast-paced, non-collectible card game for 2-4 players, featuring 100 different cards with illustrations from leading artists such as Ed Beard Jr., Quinton Hoover, Carisa Swenson, Melissa Benson, and Donato Giancola.
\13\ \13\
Camelot Legends divides the Arthurtian world into three main locations: the chivalric kingdom of Camelot, the treacherous domain of Cornwall, and the enchanted realm of the Perilous Forest. Throughout the game, players create factions of characters who attempt to complete quests and overcome their enemies. Rival knights endeavor to surmount the difficult challenges that arise at each location. When the final event is complete, the knights who have accomplished the most challenging tasks capture the mantle of victory!

The game is fun, but boy is it fiddly.  This one could have used some serious editing/playtesting/etc.  The problem, surprisingly for a card game of this nature, is NOT ambiguities in card interaction.  Rather, it is the graphic design and overall visual pollution of the game.  It is not easy to keep track of what is going on.  Because of this, I recommend it as a 2 player game, not as a 3-4 player game.  I think the fun factor would wear out quickly in a 3-4 player game.

Got this game as a free bonus with an order. I didn't know what to expect, and I was very pleasantly surprised! A really cool, highly thematic King Arthur game. I enjoy playing this very much for the stories it creates.

Played it through with some friends, using the beginner rules. Great game, but I will not play it with those friends again.  Careful people who spent five minutes each, per turn to consider every move and possibility.  Not something that fit me, as I grow impatient after 30 seconds of downtime.  

If i find some careless friends I will bring the game to the table again. :-)

After 1st play.

This game needs to be tweaked. Next time I will try some variants from forum, because I see that this game has potential..

I wasn't aware that all Arthurian Legends were written in an 8-point font.

RATING: 5
First couple of plays are tough because of the text on the cards. After that it should get better.

RATING: 5
Rather simple and evocative game, only the large amount of small font-ed text makes it slow, might improve with repetive plays.

This game is a showcase for some quite nice art.  The cards are thick and high quality.  The game is an excorcise in tracking numerous interacting elements effectively.  I like it all right, but it doesn't thrill me.

A surprise hit!  Very close game every time I have played this one.

A non-collectible game that plays like a CCG. Quite difficult for new players and first few plays will be tough because of calculating and remembering each card's special abilities. Beautiful cards and artwork makes it very thematic.

The game's very slow. You're constantly looking at all the cards on the table, reading all the abilities and calculating all the consequences: if I move the knight there, what will he do, etc. And that was just the base game (only blue shields).

Sadly, this game has sat on the shelf unplayed for the past 3 years. I got this for the cool theme and wonderful artwork. Hope to play it one day.

I like it.  I can see where people are annoyed by the text and the symbols and the recalculating.  Those reasons alone will keep this game from rising to excellence, in my book.  Still, a solid, enjoyable game design.

The most beautiful artwork in any card game I've ever played.  The size of text and symbol matching slow down the play somewhat but all in all an interesting game that I enjoy.  GORGEOUS!

After reading the rules, this game looked very promising. After looking at the cards. the artwork also was looking good. I was looking forward to play this game. What a disappointment this became. The different skills of each person are illustrated with shields. Shield which make no sense to me at all, so I can’t make up the strength of a person just by intuition. Also the text on the cards are very, very small, which make it very hard to read. Add to this, that this is just a majority game combined with some logic management, and you might understand why I got bored while I was playing this one. No fun for me at all.

Preciosas ilustraciones. Muy bien ambientado. Es un poco más lento que otros del estilo porque hay que andar leyendo todas las cartas. Buen juego.

Math heavy. Also, the cards can be a little convoluted as you increase the difficulty. Luckily you have 3 skill levels and that can keep the card craziness in check. Otherwise a nice game with some angling and a good dip in the mythos.

RATING: 7.5
The game isn't hard to understand and find his force on the card sistem that makes every challange different to another. The location and the idea of moving the knights from site to site is very good.

I love this game. Awesome theme + great mechanics = an 7.5. Takes a bit to learn the cards but who cares if you play enough.

Not a hit, but not entirely bad. Feels quite random, though.

Se colocan cartas de quest en 3 ubicaciones. Cada quest indica las habilidades necesarias para ganarla (ej: 13 ptos de combate). Los personajes tienen 6 habilidades (y algunos efectos). Si colocas suficientes personajes en la ubicación para igualar o superar la quest debes esperar a tu proximo turno para ganarla.

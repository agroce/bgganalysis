Very tug of war style gameplay. I place this here, you remove it on the next turn, etc. Boring. 45 different cards to each player's deck that you draft 15 from per game, but they all amount to basically the same things. - K+A

A similar game in feel to King of Siam. Lots of to-ing and fro-ing in a tug of war to win areas. Not sure the +1 bonus is worth fighting for. A useful 2 player game but for that reason, not one that will get played that often.

I am sure the drafting part of it is interesting (only played with the basic setup), but the main engine for the game just feels too much like "tug-o-war".  Not a bad game, but I just don't think there is enough here to stand out.  I also didn't feel like the theme came through at all.

Wow, a big disappointment. Takes the tug-of-war mechanics from Twilight Struggle and removes all of the tension and drama. Turns are boring, decisions are bland, and the gameplay doesn't feel interesting or thematic at all (especially since you keep reshuffling your decks, playing the same events over and over). Even the card actions all feel generic and samey. Sold.

Sola fide is an interesting deck-building card game for two players. Each move takes a lot of thought and strategy. It will take a few plays for each player to learn the card decks to be better equipped to select the best cards. I would say it is more interesting than fun, but we enjoy this game when we are in the mood for a quiet thinking man's game. I do wish that there was a bit more interaction with the theme, but it does come with a separate leaflet to historically describe the background for each card.

RATING: 8
Rather simple game of area control, playing smoothly; limited number of decisions to make, but fun to play; being able to draft your own deck optimally will take some plays. This is important however, because missing a certain type of card can offer strong imbalance in the game. Sometimes the end game takes too long as both players are competing for one last territory only and play goes constantly back and forth. I do not feel the theme very strongly while playing as it actually does not matter which historic texture is on the cards. You just follow the instructions and the more you play the more you instantly know what possibilities a card offers.

Love the idea of the theme here, and if it is a reimplemented and improved version of Campaign Manager 2008, could be good:

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1614652/sola-fide-reformation-basically-reimplementation-c

Theme is apparently quite pasted on and dry, and artwork not very inspiring.  Can also drag somewhat, a back-and-forth slogfest. But it does eliminate the issue which made the previous incarnation broken.

Szerintem ez a játék többnek mutatja magát, mint amennyi. Komoly kétfős kártyavezérelt, area controlnak tűnik, de közben elég egysíkú kártyakipalgotás lesz belőle. Nagyon durván korlátoz a kevés lap, ami nagyon rányomja a bélyegét a játékra. A pakli is sovány, így menet közben monotonná válik a játék.Kicsit kellett volna még reszelni rajta, és lehetne jó, mert maga az alapmechanika a kétdimenziós többségszerzéssel zseniális, a kártyahatások is jók úgy egyesével, magukban nézve. De ez így egy játékra kevés. Mondanám, hogy a draftos expert szabállyal jobb lehet, de nem hiszem, hogy sokat változtatna azon, hogy a draft után egyszerűen uncsi végigjátszani a partyt.

I immediately fell in love with the cover artwork and the theme really attracts me. Sadly, the game is not as good. Sadly because I really wanted to like it and I was on the edge of buying the game.
The problem is that the game is a dull "forth and back again" until somebody finally scores due to lucky card drawing.
There were a few rare moments when something really worked out. With more of them, Sola Fide really could have been a solid game.
By the way: We played with the suggested card combination that promises good balancing. Don't want to experience it with a bad choice of cards.

It's a very rules-light, very fast paced 45min 2-player area control game. The theme however, is *non-existant*: yes, the cards do have names and flavor text -- and if you want to teach people about The Reformation (which I guess you should, it's an important part of western history) then you can read those cards, and you may even memorize some of the provinces and people involved. For gameplay all of this is totally irrelevant. Which is fine, but don't expect anything else.

Have only tried the basic cards and with them especially the early and the late game is quite boring. Meaningful decisions are present when you fight over 4 or more territories at the same time, which happens in the middle of the game.

My first game of Sola Fide was okay, my second one (and first one with drafting) was pretty fun and the third one was extremely boring. The game became an endless back and forth without going anywhere until we called it. For now I dropped my rating from 7 to 6.

I was soooo excited for this game, and it turned out to be a real disappointment.  The combination of the designers and the theme seemed like a sure win, but the game just wasn't very fun.  Imagine if you took Twilight Struggle but took away any of the asymmetry and removed the option to play cards for ops.  It was mostly doing the same thing on repeat for 40 minutes until someone won.  So sad about this one.

Well, I do appreciate the theme and the historical booklet inside, but it's simply worse than Campaign Manager 2008 and it's pretty much the same game. The end of the game is the worst as it can go for quite long.

RATING: 6.5
After one play, I'm on the fence about this one from strongholdgames. I heard it compared to twilightstruggle and I don't think that's a fair comparison because if you go in wanting that, I think you will be disappointed. After getting past that for myself, I was able to enjoy the area control card play that makes up the core of this game. After our first play we looked at the rest of the cards and I think playing the "first time" variant actually hurt how I received the game. The rules recommend playing with the standard 15 cards that have been predetermined at the cost of giving up deck drafting/building, which I think could add a lot of depth due to the variety that the rest of the cards present. Definitely needs another play!

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Rating could go up but I wasn't overly impressed with my first play. The theme doesn't really  come through at all in this one - could be anything and it certainly does remind me quite a bit of Campaign Manager. There is an interesting twist with event cards of your choice if you win a tile that also assist you in some way and a couple other minor twists to the game. I'd play again, but don't know that I need to own. The tug of war can get tiresome in this one. Drafting your set of cards also is likely to make the game more interesting - the base set of cards leave something to be desired but work for teaching the game.

This is a very fun game to win, since it's Catholics vs. Protestants. I like the drafting system at the beginning. I don't have enough playthroughs under my belt yet to really get a feel for the balance, but the different cards available to the Protestant player vs. the Catholic player makes for some interesting drafting choices and some picks that are a bit on the push-your-luck side. This is especially true of the Protestant side. Some of their cards are REALLY powerful, but they are very situational, so they can also just be dead-weight in the player's hand.

I think the emotional tension because of the religious theme really adds a level of exhilaration to the game and I love it! I love picking the Rosary card or the St. Teresa of Avila card and then rolfstomping Brandon with it! muahahahahha!

Somehow worse than the game it was based on, Campaign Manager 2008. First off, the various boards are set up the same way every time, so there isn't as much variation from game to game. Also, the different special cards you draw when you claim a territory make for a "rich get richer" situation, even though they aren't incredibly powerful. Couple all that with a subject that may be interesting to some, but I found it to be an incredibly bland theme for this game's system. At least with Campaign Manager, the theme was more prevalent and not just pasted on. I like this game's system, but I wish they would have adapted it to the theme rather than just do a slightly modified version of Campaign Manager.

18-11-2016. Rated after one play. This was a disappointing experience. I do enjoy card driven 'wargames' like Twilight Struggle. This is from the same authors, so I expected a similar experience. 
 
The game is very, very simple.  On your turn, you can play a card or draw a card.  The cards you play often let you put a cube on a spot on one of two spaces (nobility or peasant side), or let you shift dominance to or from nobility to peasant.  If you ever have all cube-spots on the dominant side filled with cubes of your color, you win the spot and get VPs for it. As multiple spots are available and your opponent is trying to do the same, you basically are trying to tug-of-war with your opponent until one player just seals the deal on a location.

Yeah. There is deckbuilding and that might make the game a lot better. I did play it just with the recommended cards. However, I do not think that the rest of the game is deep enough to warrant delving further into deckbuilding. It seems like it would be a lot of effort, for relatively low payout as the game is so simple, basic and frankly uninteresting.

It's not bad. It's just not a game I'd like to play a lot more often.

Fantastic theme. Let's see if they can pull it off.

From reading the rules I'm not sure we're really encompassing the Reformation here. The game seems to be concentrating on regional military influence. I'd have thought it would be more a game about theological conflict reflected in church corruption (indulgences and selling of offices). Taxes and German money staying in the region it was collected. The roll of the new printing press as the Internet of its day, spreading information faster than ever before. How Martin Luther's followers exploited this high speed information dissemination. Which princes backed the Reformation and their motivation beyond theological. Trials, excommunications, alliances, meetings, infighting, Papal authority, celibacy, Peasants' Revolt, etc.

I'll have to wait until I see the cards and play to game to decide what I think.

I somehow completely missed the fact in the lead up to this game that it is essentially the second coming of Campaign Manager 2008. I liked Campaign Manager, but focusing on drawing cards and playing out of a massive hand was kind of game breaking. This adds the simple rule of a hand limit to stop that. I love the theme of this game, and the historical connection of the cards. This amplified by the fact that the game comes with a book that gives brief descriptions of the historical context for various cards. I am not wild about the foreign influence cards, as they seem to have a real "the rich get richer" effect.

A bit dry. Missing,,,,, something. Still good.

Sola runs out the Campaign Manager system again, this time for the Reformation. I like the system through all its variations but as with Richard Breese I would like to see something different from the dynamc duo. I speak as someone who doesnt get why TS is still near the top of BGG, so I suppose you would make sequels. 

Our game was close 33-29, and the last Kreis went down to the wire. Nothing wrong with the game balance, or length, but it is super dry and is missing something. It has all the flavoursome characters but the standard 15 cards give you repetitive events - Pope Leo died four times - and with no flavour text you dont even learn as you go. I would want to be deck building or working through the wider deck somehow. 

Also, the 10 Kreis are largely indistinct. Some are pro Catholic, some worth more VPs, but broadly it is just the same thing ten times over. It is, in essence, a Euro election/control game (memories of Die Macher waft in) and the period flavour is not really there. I will read the flavour book and return.

Sounds interesting and might be something for my collection of historically themed games. First play was interesting, although the cards don't carry the theme that well - they are very generic in effects. Might be better when doing the full drafting of starting decks, but even without something I would play if in the mood.

Definitely more fun in the "draft" version than the plain version.  However, I was a bit disappointed in this one.  I was hoping for Twilight Struggle, the Reformation edition, and got a pretty plain abstract tug of war game.  This is a game that would have been better with a less "themy" theme (e.g., maybe a space exploration theme?).  The reason  is that the theme really has nothing to do with the game, and since very few of us have the same sort of connection to the Reformation than we do to, say, the Cold War, that the theme quickly became superfluous and ignored.  Add some more fun art a theme easier to connect with, and I think the game would have had more appeal.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Interesting re-implementation of Campaign Manager or at least taking that game and reworking it. The drafting mechanism means that each player will only play with 15 of the 45 cards in each game.  I have played 3 times and think this will add some variability to the game. The game is well made by Stronghold but you could need an additional power cube, if the circles are captured in a specific order. Odd that no one caught that.

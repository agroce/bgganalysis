Preliminary rating based on getting familiar with the game (I really need an opponent!)
The command system is from [thing=77][/thing]: yay!  That system is so much more interesting than the card system from Hammer of the Scots, as is the combat system in this game, which was NOT from Eastfront.
Putting Eastfront-like game in the eastern theater of the civil war is a big hit.  I liked the chrome touches in the game.  The map is too small (I don't have the Kickstarter edition), but other than that, I like what I see.

I remember playing the game a few times, and it was a challenge in terms of how much can the South push before it has to stop -- or run the risk of being overrun. However, the period was never all that appealing to me, and the game remained unplayed after those initial experiences. It deserves a better home.

The crossed swords marking the locations of historical battles on the game map provide a good impression of how concentrated fighting in the Eastern theatre was along the Shenandoah valley, between the Potomac and the Rappahanock and around Richmond.  It tells a story of years of stalemate eventually broken by the Union's superior resources. In this respect I found Bobby Lee very faithful to the history.  It seemed to me that the critical element was the players' choices in deploying replacement points. That's the highest compliment I can pay the game.  I defer to Bobby Lee veterans who have found in it an exciting game of manouevre.  I'm afraid that I just found the terrain too constricting and the density of blocks  covering it too great.

RATING: 8.5
In contrary to many others I like this one more than the Front blockgames. Although there is not much back and forth manoeuvring in Bobby Lee as in reality and although leaders are - shame, shame, shame - not included, like in Gettysburg: Badges of Courage, I do like BL very much for its good atmosphere. There are plenty of strategic options, a good tactical system, a little bluffing and - as in all block games - lucky dice. I hope Columbia Games will take the effort to modernize this still enjoyable game.

Play with the latest version of the rules. They have improved the game a lot.

When you play Columbia Games' Bobby Lee, you are experiencing Genesis for a company game series that includes Sam Grant, Liberty and Crusader Rex among others. Loads of fun, and a good geography lesson for those of you who wonder why the Yankees didn't just blast their way down the Shenandoah Valley in 1862.  Are those Pennsylvania Dutch pretzels with your beer there?

I despised it when I played it around 1995.  Seemed unrealistic, and static, and the threat of naval invasion was not too bothersome for the south.   My impression at the time (15 years ago) was that it was like WW1.  We tried several times to invade as the north, trying to spread out and fake out the south.  It didn't work due to the hexside limitation on the number of units entering.

Having read some of the reviews here, about how the north can invade, has me slightly curious. Did we overlook something?  I played with 3 different opponents, we all hated this game, though we are civil war fans and like block games.

By far the worst block game I've played.

The third edition of this game is a *vast* improvement - streaming play, adding a very sensible interpretation of leadership (a huge problem for many ACW games), bringing the playing time way down, and giving it a much more historical feel (previous editions felt a bit like EastFront ported to the ACW; this one feels like a genuine ACW game). I've only played a couple times but liked it a ton.

---

Neither this game, nor it's sister game Sam Grant, is quite in the same league as the Front games or Napoleon, but are good nontheless. Perhaps the biggest issue is the relative disconnect between the game and reality, but it still plays quite well - sort of a cross between EastFront and Napoleon in terms of complexity and play feel. A frequent complaint about this game is the lack leaders, but given the huge problems they create in so many games I think that their omission is as sensible an approach as any other. Leadership is so hard to simulate in games, and really, I think the impact of specific leaders (as opposed to the general command & control problems leaders of this period labored with) is overstated.

3rd Edition: picked up Kickstarter Edition Feb 2014. Fantastic mounted (hard board) map, large hexes, good looking counters, and revised, shortened rules. 2 plays, excellent! Knocking my socks off. Love the many streamlined chrome nuances, easy playability and the right amount of simulation. Lots of tough choices, consequences, maneuver, plot development on a fantastic map. The tactical battles system is also a win. Columbia Games, good job. Please update Sam Grant this way!
=====
2nd Edition: 1 learning game (campaign), 2nd edition. Took 5 hrs with learning, wine, and philosophical chatting. Wow, the geography is such an interesting, exasperating factor here. Managing it seems vital in almost every decision. (Union Commander D. says, "Stupid mountains, so obnoxious! and later, "Stupid River!") You can't do everything, yet you must! I lived in Virgina but I had no idea that this was the situation. Good map here. I feel like now I'm understanding the Civil War a lot better than before. (To save time, we used Niko Ruf's application of Columbia Games A-B-C style block battles - we thought it worked well - http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/344385). I imagine the game could benefit from dummy blocks a la Quebec for greater FOW. I miss the use of ACW cavalry for screening & scouting (I'm not an expert but Across the Potomac is the only ACW game I know of that does that well. Now that I think about it I think Forged in Fire handles cav better, although the scale is different.)

This game, together with its sister game Sam Grant, gives a broad brush stroke coverage to the Civil War. I like it because it's considerably less fiddly than For The People, and still gives a strong sense of the challenges both sides faced during the war. Creative thinking is needed here to prevent getting bogged down in a slugfest, so novices may become frustrated with the game.

This is a tricky game. It's certainly on the upper limit of complexity for me. However all those extra rules and exceptions do lead to some decisions which are very historical, based on my limited experience of the subject. My score would likely be higher were it not for the length of the game.

Based on the 1862 scenario.  It's very impressive how much game can be had with so few pieces on such small a map.  But as with other outstanding Columbia Games, BL offers a lot of challenges for both the North and the South.  I'm curious to see how either side could achieve a decisive victory consistently.  Will definitely play again as there is a lot to explore.

One of the better block games. Although, in my opinion, the South starts a bit too strong in the campaign game, which tends to slow down the flow more than history requires. 

Using blocks to solve one of wargame's biggest problems (no Fog of War) was inspired, but not perfect. You still know where the enemy is and is not. You still know his approximate size. But, still, it's a great improvement over perfect intelligence.

A great Civil War game: fast playing, relatively easy to learn and fun.

Third edition is very playable, it also gives the possibility to play each year separately. Rules are clean and complete, even considering the need for some minor clarification. Components are outstanding. To get a complete set of dice though a separete order on Columbia's site is needed; also, truth to be told, the confederate grey blocks would need a better paint job (I resprayed mine) while the map would benefit from a locating grid. Overall nonetheless a first class product.

Bobby Lee has few equals as an operational game, but the tactical game is lacking. I respect that the creators wanted to get away from restrictive system in which just dice are rolled to resolve combat; they wanted to invoke maneuver and positioning. It worked in Pacific Victory, where each unit has different battle values depending on their target and carrier battles were abstracted through a search roll. In Bobby Lee though the tactical lacks lacks elegance and realism. So does Battle Cry but that game never really tries for it, while Bobby Lee has the feel of a serious wargame. The beauty, simplicity, and accuracy of the operational game is hurt by a tactical game that is lacking in nearly every regard.

Interesting game with lots of scenarios.  Kind of limited in its application.  Has some serious limitations, namely with the HQs organized the way they are and all units swept up into a generic unit type.  All in all, it does it's job as a generic simulation of a larger war.  I just wanted more, and it didn't deliver.

Good: Strategic - Civil War - Easy 

Nice block game system about the civil war and don't let the silly name scare you.
Plus: covering the entire war detailed yet simple. Clean game system!
Minus: the South is constrained 
Replayability is good eventhough the South is constrained and has limited options. But there lies the challenge! Can you come up with the strategy to stop the Yanks?! 
Imo did not get the credit it deserves. I think the reason for it is that the game has much more to offer than appears at first sight. 
I never cared for it's sister game Sam Grant though and reading the comments I gues it stays that way.

I did research for this game (artillery O/B and map) using a book by McClellan written in 1864! The book was called "Army of the Potomac" and was just sitting in the stacks at the downtown branch of the Indianapolis library!!

Nice simulation of "the cockpit" of the Civil War. Lots of feints and fog of war with this one. Good O/B within the limitations imposed by the number of blocks. My favorite Civil War simulation.

An excellent "block" game covering the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War. The blocks with their hidden strengths impart "fog of war" using a very simple mechanism.

This game is my nominee for the most under-appreciated and under-rated game in all of Boardgame Geekdom!  Allow me to respond to the common criticisms.  Criticism no. 1 - the game is static and reflects the feel of WWI trench warfare, not the Civil War.  Well, it is if you play it that way but not only don&#039;t you have to, it&#039;s unwise to if you want to maximize your chances for victory.  The Union has four avenues of attack available to him - the Shenandoah Valley, the Piedmont, the Penninsula, and Norfolk.  Inexperienced players usually just mass the blue blocks in the center, eye the Piedmont, and opt for &quot;hey-diddle-diddle, straight-down-the-middle.&quot;  The Rebel player says, fine, let&#039;s party - and the Union hits a wall.  Well folks, there a reason that none of the Union commanders had the guts to try this.  And it wouldn&#039;t have worked for Grant earlier in the war were he on the scene either.  If the Union forces the Reb to spread out by threatenging two or three fronts, he can thin the lines enought to break through into Virginia somewhere if he plays his cards right - or even tempt the Confederate into an offensive north that&#039;s more a trap than an opportunity.  In fact, I&#039;ve had as much dramatic give-and-take in this game as I&#039;ve had in &quot;EastFront&quot;!  Miracle come-backs and wild swings of fortune are more than occaissional happenstances.  Criticism no. 2 - Bobby Lee ignores too much about the campaigns in Virginia like the trench warfare around Petersberg.  Well, consider it abstracted into the battleboard system (which works wonderfully in this game, by the way, and poses fascinating tactical quandries).  But look, if you want a soup-to-nuts simulation, there are indeed games that will do that better than Bobby Lee.  But if you want a game that focuses on the big picture and is more concerned with putting you in the commanders&#039; shoes, this game can&#039;t be beat.  I suspect that this is a tough game to &quot;master&quot; for many and few give it the time necessary to discover all the richness that can be initially overlooked in a first playing.

The Eastern theater of the American Civil War. The best block game I've played. Has been described by some as "static" and "World War I-like", but I can only say I disagree: In my experience, while the game can certainly degenerate into a static slugmatch, it only does so if that's the players' mindset. If one wants to try daring outflanking maneuvers, cavalry raids and such, the game definitely allows it. Also, the game doesn't use named leaders, which allows it to avoid the pitfall usually seen in strategic ACW games, where players practice rules laywering by hiding bad leaders far from the front.

Yet another great blockgame by Columbia. Maybe less nailbitingly tense than Rommel in the Desert and probably not as dramatic as Eastfront, but BL defenitely has its own strengths. First of all an interesting strategic situation with several avenues of attack open to both sides. Then there is the emphasis on manoeuvring, trying to outflank the enemy or positioning your armies for a high odds assault (knowledge of terrain and using it to your advantage is very important in this game). And last but not least, the way battles are resolved on the battleboard, which makes for an interesting tactical subgame of exactly the appropriate complexity. One relative drawback is that I have my doubts about the scenarios as standalone games.

My rating applies only to the 3rd edition as I have no experience with the former ones. While not that accurate a simulation, as others have noted, given the level of abstraction it gives a good overall look on the theater. The tactical battles familiar from Napoleon, trimmed to near perfection here, are a great addition to the "Eastfront Lite" command control system. The battle system adds another layer of agonizing decisions and most importantly is FUN. Even the longest scenario plays faster than Eastfront, so in that regard Bobby Lee is becoming one of my "go to" games. The minor gripes I had about balance in the beginning aren't an issue after a few more plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Maybe block game can apply well to the  Civil War.  The publisher still carries stock of this game. This one focuses on the Eastern theatre.  A first read of the rules finds the concept of hexside limit rather difficult to absorb at first.  Another quite new to "hex-based only-wargamer" is the use of battleboard in combat.  However, with increasing experience, these could be overcome and the game can be completed in an enjoyable evening.

Only 1 play, and my poor Union was whipped in every battle. But played well and the battle board mechanism worked very well (if not for me).

Another play another defeat. This time as Reb. I didnlt launch enough strategic offensives to keep the Union off balance, and in my battles didn't take advantage of the Confederate's superior flanking skills. That said we misplayed the arty rules in battle so it could have been even worse than the Union 1863-4 steam roller that crushed all before and seeped throughout the South.

Oh the War of Northern Aggression... Bobby Lee lovingly recreates the bloody battlefields of Virginia from 1861 to 1865. It has great tactical and strategic options as you play as North or South. There's a fog of war mechanic where you never know the true strength of the enemy units until you meet in battle. In addition the dice based combat is done on a battle board which simulates the left flank, center, right flank, and reserve of a battle line. Artillery, Cavalry, and generals all play their special roles in battle as well. I want to play this more, but since it is 1v1 in a niche genre I don't get to often enough.

Very disapointing game, just too many counters and the history was not there.  No leaders for an ACW game is BAD.  There were units in every hex stretching from Fredericksburg all the way to West Virginia, I was waiting for the panzers to break through for an encirclement around Manassas.  Obviously the armies of the Civil War never covered that amount of space, but they did in this game.

Mmmmmmm...crunchy!  There's a lot going on here, and it reminds me of the titanic and brilliant EastFront for a variety of reasons.  I havn't yet played all the way through, but I'd sure like to.  Very nice use of the battleboard, and the Fog of War works really well here.  But there is a niggling little voice in my head that says, "Psst!  Bobby Lee and Sam Grant in the same package with streamlined rules!"  Angel or devil?  Who cares?  Wouldn't that rock?

RATING: 9
A very enjoyable and tense game which provides an excellent and historical feel for the eastern theatre of the ACW.  Unlike most other games on the subject you cannot use gamey ploys to manipulate your leaders - because there aren't any!  Two minor weaknesses: long-range cavalry raids are too easy to carry out, and in the late game the US artillery is too powerful.  House rules can easily fix both points.

RATING: 9
Playing a single year is unsatisfactory, since it is quite possible that the fronts will hardly move. Playing through the entire war takes rather long, so I haven't played this as often as I'd like. My rating may well go up if I get more games under my belt. So far, there are some rules issues/effects I am not sure I like.

Update: Rating raised from 6 to 7 after some solo play. The game feels less static once you learn to navigate the map. My only problem now is play length.

Update: Since I started playing this by email, I've come to fully appreciate this game. It takes a bit of study to play this game well - try a campaign game solitaire and try out what works and which strategy is bound to fail disastrously. Very tense, and you never have enough resources to do everything you might want, not even as the Union. Rating raised to 9.

By my third session of "Bobby Lee" I could not find anywhere in the rules where it was clearly stated who attacks whom first, or when--outside of first engagement, when defense gets one salvo against attackers. 

The combat rules as originally devised in this game's 2.0 version were very muddled, so I adopted the published combat variation by Niko Ruf, which nicely emulates later refinements in the Columbia block games system. 

But the variant vastly simplified the play of this game, thus allowing me to concentrate on game play rather than rules. At that point I totally agree with players who say this is thinking man's game, and as Jerry Taylor points out, for the Union player it's a matter of figuring out the best way to open multiple fronts to spread out the CSA forces and seek to create openings into Virginia. 

It would have been easy to have given up on this game as too static, but I stayed with it and kept thinking until I began to see ways of loosening up the CSA lines. I can understand why some would find this too tedious, but personally I found my perseverence rewarding. That point of view may be borne out by the fact that Columbia Games published a revised, updated 3rd Edition.

Initial rating a 7 (October 2011)--could go up. Purchased new (1993 edition), September 2011.

RATING: 3
Everything is there for a good game except the good.  Perhaps too many charts?  Or slow tedious play?  Hard to say, but this just does not flow like most of Columbia's   other block games.  Try Dixie for a great Civil war title by Columbia.

I am a big fan of Columbia Block Games, Civil War games and General Robert E. Lee ... so my rating of 9 reflects these preferences. However, you will not be disappointed with this game. Not sure if is still for sale from the Columbia Games website, but you might find a copy on eBay ...

Enjoy this block war-game.  Between two players that know their Civil War history a tense and exciting game is bound to ensue.  Quick to set up and play; one of the better "light" Civil War games out there that presents and plays very well.  Have version 2.0

A fecund game that needs analysis to be played competently. There are several opportunities for both sides. One feels like a Civil War general figuring out the best strategy. The battle maps create satisfying tactical decisions. The fog of war keeps players wondering what they are facing.

Good "lighter" civil war game.  Relatively easy to learn, and it took a couple of plays to get the rules down to the point where the game flows nicely.  It usually takes about 1 1/2 to 2 hours per game year.  It does highlight the difficulties of the Civil War each side faced (North had manpower, but poor leadership and difficulites keeping campigning armies in supply, while the South had good to great leadership, only had to defend to win, but had a serious manpower shortage), while keeping the rules limited with no complicated charts and tables.

I've only played Bobby Lee 3 or 4 times in the past few years, but I enjoy it more and more with each play.  I only wish I had more time to get this on the table.  It defintely takes some practice to learn how to maximize terrain, RPs, maneuver, and the tactical battle board.

I like Columbia Games' wargame system, with its sophisticated implementation of logistics and fog of war. You can even screen enemy forces with blank blocks, a common enough tactic in real war. Having a strategic map for maneuvering forces and a tactical battleboard for a smashing dicefest is also nice. Very enjoyable recreation of the Eastern campaigns of an epic conflict.

RATING: 5
Doesn&#039;t quite seem to capture the ebb &amp; flow of the historical campaigning.  The Rebel player can pretty much sit on his ass all game and still win.  I guess that&#039;s realistic, but not very interesting.  Maybe too small a map scale as well (each hex covers a lot of territory).

[3 plays] I am a Civil War history enthusiast. So when I first got this game, I really wanted to like this. Despite knowing other Columbia Games very well, and liking them a great deal, this one seemed clunky and overly complicated. The game flow of the strategic decision tree tended to be constantly interrupted by decisions on the tactical battleboard, and that just seemed too disconnected to me. I sold it after 2 plays several years ago. 

In the last 2 years I was convinced by comments from people I respect like Jerry Taylor that I need to play this again. I traded for a new copy and revised the battle system to a simpler style in the vein of Liberty and Hammer. The initial playtest of that scenario was quite promising. The game went smoother, faster, and the fun of manuevering on the Civil War map was unmasked. If it holds up and proves to be well balanced I'll post my changes here eventually.

Most recent play 3-11-07 with Garrett.

Still not sure about this game...it has a lot to like, a few things to dislike but just lacks a certain something to make it spark.  Can get annoyingly crowded on the map and some of the rivers etc make it hard to quickly see what crossing rules apply where etc

Boy this is a lovely system.  There is so much going on, so that you always have too many things that you need to do and not enough ability to come close to stabilizing yourself.  Fortunately both sides feel that way.  Sure this is a dice game so there is going to be good or bad luck, but the movement and field combat is so much fun that it doesn't really matter.  Easily the best block game that I've played.  My rating could go up with more plays.

I suggest marking the passes and the river transitions with settler's roads or something just to make things clearer.  This also could use a battle token to place on the board to indicate where the battle is taking place.

Traded away... I generally find "block systems" for Fog of War unsatisfying.  You wind up with masses of blocks staring at one another.  Too much fog.  You should have some general idea of composition or strength, but you wind up hurtling your pile of wood into someone elses.

Good Game. Own both editions. I might like the older version better.  Tight maneuvering. Confederates must be careful. Won as the Confederacy by trading space for time. Then caught my friend overextended pushing towards Richmond. I then outflanked him from the Shenandoah countering from Lynchburg and pushing from Charlottesville and cut him off. His units collapsed without supply. Ha! He was so pissed.

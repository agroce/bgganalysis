RATING: 5
Sistema en solitario para cartas mio.
Adaptación del juego de Napoleonic Wars al frente ruso, pero más complicado, con mecánicas nuevas para el desgaste.
Demasiadas cartas en cada mano para jugar en el turno de otro oponente, lo que ralentiza el juego esperando a ver las cartas de reacción.
Excesivo texto en las cartas que también ralentiza y sin ilustraciones en las mismas, lo que da menos sabor histórico.
El mapa con poca variedad, incluso feo y las figuras de los generales y líderes parecen una caricatura...

RATING: 7
CDG with a lot of special rules.  Kind of boring for the Tsarist player, as there's not a lot to do early on but stall and try to build up a second line of defense.  I found it a little boring while playing it- it kind of dragged (again, as the Tsarist player).  I'm sure it's a whole different experience as the Imperial player.

Initial Impression: This is a 4 player game. No 2 ways about it. There's a certain tension lacking if not played that way. This CDG feels a little lackluster and the some events have a strong "take that" feel to them. Although the attrition and morale systems are fiddly, I feel that they add to the historical flavor of the conflict and enhance the game.

RATING: 8
First impression from one 1.5 turns playing as the Tsarists: beautiful, thematic, engaging, and of excellent component quality. As a two player I felt somewhat overwhelmed by having to manage two hands of 14 cards total, but I still kept Napoleon from reaching St. Petersburg! It may be that this is better played with 4 players. Still, since I enjoy complexity in my games it was an enjoyable experience.

This game may be too complex for what I expect from a 4 player CDG.  I really like Wellington and Nap Wars, but have not yet decided if I will ever play Kutuzov again.

The artwork is beautiful, and yet during setup I was annoyed with how busy the artwork is and the font used for the text on the map to label the cities.  Don't like the small size of the text on the cards either.  I would prefer it to have the same art style and font as was used for Wellington and Napoleonic Wars. 

The turn sequence and the rules are more complex than Wellington or Napoleonic Wars.  My recommendation is to not spend your money on Kutuzov unless you really like the Nap Wars system and are completely played out of Wellington and Nap Wars.

This game follow its ancestors in that some of the rules have followed into Kutuzov. It doesn't make the games alike, but they have a basic rule set together. A game with good rules that follow the actual event quite well.The added morale and attrition rules can be seen a bit daunting at the beginning, but gives the game a nice depth when you know them. Increase the playing time a bit, that is not noticble.
Knowing the history a bit give you a nice fealing for the game too.

1. Design - cards are nice and pretty, map - solid artwork (but thin), same as counters (too little for me).
2. Mechanics - another CDG game from GMT based on "Napoleonic Wars" and "Wellington" system with chrome of 1812 campaign. All is clear and works, but to me personally - I prefer hex and counters games of this scale - "Highway to Kremlin" from OSG is the best example. 
3. Play - lots of fun with 2, 3, 4 players. 3-4 hours game length (of course with sudden victory it's goes faster). But like I said - I don't like play cards in Napoleonic era. I must feel climax of this era warfare. Kutuzov did n't have enough of this.

RATING: 7.5
I played twice and enjoyed avery game. Kutuzov is much more subtle then Wellington (which is a dice and battle card feast). 
I suspect that the game hold little replay value since the french strategy seems pretty obvious. Take note that this is a suspect and that I'd like to explore other strategy before raising the vote.

Much heavier then TNW or Wellington; a lot of care and thought went into this design, and it is deeply interesting, but I still have trouble grokking the Morale and Attrition systems at the game's heart, and wonder if some additional streamlining during development could have made this a top ten game for me.

I've given up. In four PBeM games, I could not make a move without constantly rereading the Morale and Attrition rules. Sent to a new home.

Due to added subsystems--Morale and Attrition--this is a significantly more difficult (and slower) game to learn than Nappy or Wellington.  Nevertheless, quite rewarding.  It will take several plays to get the strategy down.  One piece of advice for the French, pick one spot to attack.  A broad attack across the line did not fare well for us.

On repeated plays, this game has really grown on me.  There are several strategies for the French to choose from and the Russians must really play great defense.  Additionally, once you get a game or two under your belt, Morale and Attrition become second nature and the game speeds up accordingly.  Do not fear this, it could be better than Wellington.

I am enjoying playing Kutuzov a LOT!

Strategic, Napoleonic campaign in Russia, card driven. 

My favourite game from Napoleonic Wars system by Mark McLaughlin (and the most complex one without being fiddly). Incorporates many elements to grant some chrome for the period, scorched earth, cossacks, French attrition, morale level for both sides, entrenchments. 

The most intrincate victory conditions I've seen, though one can handle them after some reads or with the help of a summary. 

Some events are really powerful, and warm your wrists because you will throw many dice here. However, I love it.

A very involved game and a strong simulation with a lot of nuance once you get passed the complicated rules that can be a real pain up front. You get the feeling that the designer knows the campaign and that this was sort of a passion project. I'd like to see a more streamlined version of this applied to other Napoleonic campaigns like the defensive phase of the Peninsular War, the first Italian Campaign, and the Danube Campaign.

After playing Wellington, I figured this would be a similar game but on the Russian Front.  I was terribly mistaken.  It is still a good game, but the time and rules investment are very high.  Supplies, partisans, and morale are all tracked and it can be a lot to hold onto.  Ultimately, I'd rather play a different 4-player game than come back to this one.

RATING: 6
seems somewhat ponderous - you know what the French are going to do and the outcome just depends on how well you roll the dice.  the addition of morale and attrition definately makes it a deeper game than Wellington and it seemed less luck-based (LESS being the operable word, it certainly is not Chess!).

Of course, it is also much longer to play than Wellington, which may be too much to ask given that a bad roll of the dice may be unrecoverable.

The third game in the Napoleonic card game series.  Less of a card-driven game, the cards are used to offer strategic and operational options for both players. The invasion and subjugation of Russia.  

The game does have a good and sound system to simulate some of the cool decisions facing both sides.  Some of the cards might not be that authentic as to the effects of the event.  For example, weather can be played out with an event card and thus you can see winter in July Russia.  Disaster could strike a city with card.  I am not convinced of that but some might think of a design for effect.  

I do like all the other aspects that the game derives from We the People though.  For example, the control of the duchy is important to intercept and supply line.  The "will to fight" (i.e. morale), the political effects, for battles lost and the morale level drop.  

The map is highly abstract for a typical strategic level map.  But it depicts the route for Napoleon to Moscow quite nicely.  The fortress,  key town and supply depot are subject to sieges. There are quite a lot of gaming concepts that reflect the period.  I like how well they are integrated into the system.  

It is a game that could be suitable to 4 players very well, with each commanding an army.  Despite checking the rules from time to time, it is still a kind of awesome experience to me as Napoleon charged to Borodino, with Ney and Davout closing in onto the Russian depot, city of Smolensk.  Disaster stroke the city but the Russians were still too many inside it, as stacking is unlimited!  

We played the game scenario 3 - On to Smolensk!, starting on Turn 2. We managed to complete Turn 2 impulses in three hours but we were kind of burnt out by then with 40 pages of rules, not proceeding to Attrition. 3 of us played the game the first time and it's second time to me. I played it back in 2008 when it was first released and so most of the rules were forgotten by me. 

Despite checking the rules from time to time, it is still a kind of awesome experience to me as Napoleon charged to Borodino, with Ney and Davout closing in onto the Russian depot, city of Smolensk. Disaster stroke the city but the Russians were still too many inside it, as stacking is unlimited! This is truly a wargame, not for the faint of heart! 

This is truly a wargame, not for the faint of heart!  But I very much like to explore deeper into the game, at home solitaire.  There is still a lot to be learned about this game. Plus, the Playbook is awesome to read.

At first I was thinking that the game was too "enriched" of stuff compared to Wellington (I mean attrition and moral levels, Depot centers and some other minor stuff) but after 3 plays and one more going on I changed my mind and I feel thet is really an inmprovement of Wellington, and the added rules are logical not so hard to remember. Not easy choices for the players and some good strategic alternatives to play with... I think I'll play often in the future.

The most complex of the McLaughlin bucket o dice Nappy era games. with some pretty complex victory conditions and some heavy chrome to simulate army morale and attrition. Its also the most unstable of the three Nappy games; due to event cards and Loot rules. its possible for one side to get several unanswered card plays in a row and the game can go off the rails .  Worth exploring if you've interested in the campaign and like the other games in the series otherwise its probably a pass .

Topic too operational for a Napoleonic CDG from GMT (maybe "Habit of Victory" is a starting point for stuff like that). Strange decision to publish it.
Also wrong Design as 4-Player and 2-Teams CDG. Especially the french side needs strong coordination of both powers, in fact there is no room for two independent commands and thus players. The historical situation in Spain as published in the "Wellington" CDG fits better for this type of player arrangement.

Kutuzov is a good operational level card driven wargame. Furthermore, it’s also a nice simulation considering that it is a low complexity four-player wargame that plays in one evening. The system is rather intuitive and works well. Morale and attrition rules are just great. The battle system is pretty bad but works ok.

Kutuzov is a very chaotic wargame. Cards and dice keep altering the situations. However, that is just right considering what the game simulates. Everyone who has read about the campaign of 1812 knows that luck and unpredictable circumstances played a major role. The events in this game are really witty and based on historical circumstances.

Even though Kutuzov is an easy wargame the rules are difficult to digest (especially so if you haven’t played Napoleonic Wars and/or Wellington). Many of the major points aren’t presented clearly and the rulebook is far too long for what it is (40 pages). It's a struggle to understand how everything works together. This game lacks good player handouts.

Sold it.

Follow up to Wellington, but with extra rules for scorched earth (using red plastic counters), and attrition, which was fiddly and took up too much time.

RATING: 8
Very detailed and involved rendering of the Russian campaign that so tragically ended. As two player game, it works very well. I am not sure it warrants the effort for four players as the downtime might be significant especially when battles are starting. On the other hand, four brains at this might cause less rulesbooklet flipping. 
We played 2 turns in app. 6 hours with two players, so this game is looooong. The rules have some small nits to pick as they tend to hide special cases, but the excellent index is a great support. 

All in all, well worth getting if you like CDG multiplayers with detailed historical background. It creates epic maneuvres and the cards guarantee that perfect plans are not possible. How often we cried out that only one single cardplay/resource/strength point would have made the difference. So, it's a bit chaotic and he who masters the possibilities of the cards will get away best. It also creates believable history. Thumbs up.

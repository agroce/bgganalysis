Not sure how I feel about this one. It is not bad with fewer player counts. But I don't believe I'll every play again with 5+. Also not sure if we'll ever play with event cards again. We got mostly negative events and it made the game frustrating with little/no reward.

It's on my radar.  Farming without the pesky "feeding workers" aspect of many popular farming games.  I like that it can hold 6p, but I'm not sure how well it will play with that many, especially since there are only 10 water cubes total and running out causes a drought (which would probably happen often with 6p). Also, I don't know if I will like the randomness of acquiring animals and other items with the custom dice (1-1-1-2-2-3)... someone who is lucky with a couple of die rolls will have a big advantage with animals or meat.

CHANGES IN SECOND EDITION (per designer):

FEATURES:
* Updated rules, considered all comments received in the last 6 years.
* Up to 6 players instead of 4.
* Revised markets A and B
* New city markets (available from the beginning of the game, so you can plan).
* New improvements for the last rounds, which focus on earning pesos at game end.
* Added Water for irrigation (necessary now to produce) and training horses.
* Added horses and Rodeo
* New third level goods (desserts and chicha)

LOGIC BEHIND LOW RESOURCE COUNT (per designer in KS comments):

Some people have shown some concern about the quantity of components. Don’t worry about that because we have several reasons to have chosen the quantity of components for every wooden piece . We tested many times and the conclusions are the following:
1) Since the game is faster now (it only last 7 rounds) you cannot obtain big quantities of animals. Besides players usually obtain animals on the first rounds, since in later rounds they try to produce level 2 and 3 goods. 
2) We intentionally wanted water and horses to be very limited. In this way people can feel the need to obtain them soon. 
3) We want players to try different strategies one from the other. If everything is available always that’s no possible. 
4) We tested many times with different quantities for each component, and that’s how why came up with the final list. 
The truth is that when we published the first edition we were very excited to have gathered the funds, so we added many unnecessary additional components to the game. That does not only increase the production cost but also the shipping charges. In this edition we are trying to do our best to give you the best game possible at the lowest price (and with the lowest shipping cost possible). If you check the chart of how money raised will be distributed you will have a better idea of what I’m talking about. --Alberto--

Neat/new farming game where you're raising crops/animals in order to get their commodity to make better commodities to create even better commodities.  The game has a bit of a "tech tree" of resources.  You're trying to make as many sets of different things as you can.  Money is points.  Markets allow you to sell your stuff, but you also need your stuff to make better stuff.  There's also some awesome improvement cards that allow you to upgrade materials for free, etc...  At a glance it looks like a light-hearted easy game, but it's surprisingly crunchy.

In this second edition, players will have all the fun included in the original Mi Tierra plus more, since the second edition includes many more features like use of water for plantations, horses, new products and more. Also, instead of four players you will be able to play up to six-player games. Finally, the rules of the game have been revised to make sure that Mi Tierra gets even better.

2017-03-21 : First play and this doesn't happen often, but I messed up my game not once, not twice, but an innumerable number of times - it was just one of those days. The board layout is amateur level, but I've got this sneaky feeling there's a good game in there, with multiple paths to victory so definitely requires another play

Converting your goods to more valuable goods is rewarding and reminds me of Le Havre.  The chits in that game were more fun to handle than the cards in this one though.  It is solid and does what it does well.  The included expansions add a little flair and were a nice touch.

What an utterly disappointing game. The idea is good for a worker placement game with some resource to VP conversion. But it feels very clunky and luck driven with the dice. Also using score as a turn order is such a bad idea coz scores in this game is also the money you buy things with. You could just hoard everything, be first every time and make a big turn at the end of the game The balance for the game is also quite out of whack. Would rather be playing Agricola or some of the other better worker placement games.

RATING: 7
Took a bit to work it out, but once we got a handle on it, my family really liked it. It is a constrained move worker placement game (never enough workers to do everything you want) but having a couple of worker spots per option per round makes it feel less directly competitive than other games that only have one slot. Should increase our rating once we become more familiar with it. Product itself is good quality, great animeeples, though it could use extra resource cards and a better rule book. Hoping the bgg community can get the rules sorted soon.

I played this a couple of times 2 player (basic game) and it was a fun, however we played it 3 player the other day and one player took control of the water and dropped his score to zero through the black market which meant he went first every turn and sat on the water every turn as his first move. This then meant that no-one could train horses or harvest more than the starting good/s (2 apples max), any money he made he immediately spent in factories, upgrades and black market - always returning to zero, so no-one could take first play from him. This then left the animal pens for the other 2 players to fight over and very limited options, this remained so even to the end where going first he was able to choose his factory for stage 3 goods and no one could prevent him from winning.  Seeing an opponent winning from turn 2 and realising there is nothing you can do to stop it left me feeling dissatisfied (to say the least). To me this game is broken and needs a mechanism that either spreads water a little more freely or where turn order is changed every round (or at least has a chance to be taken at perhaps some cost), I expect in worker placement games to be blocked from various actions, but not continually and for that player there is usually a "loss" somewhere. 
Saying all this I will play this again, I enjoyed the 2 player games and I feel there is a nice game in there, the rest of the mechanisms mesh together well and although it will never better some of the other more well known worker placement games it is interesting enough.

But this doesn't stop me from being able to enjoy a game.

Only 1 play so far and the overall feeling I got was.. Meh.

Very nice worker placement game with a unique, fun art style.  Unlike other farming sims, this one has you taking resources two steps beyond in the manufacturing process, resulting in a big board of interconnected areas.  Market stalls, rodeo rewards, farm upgrades and tiered factory products combine to make each game different and ensure that no one strategy can dominate.  The cards are a bit flimsy and the farm upgrades and markets should have been cardboard tiles, but it doesn't detract too much from the outstanding gameplay.  That said, the wood components are top notch, with outstanding animeeples and vegimeeples, even water shaped pieces.

It's a pretty good worker placement game. I really like that the rules offer some variants, specially the one with no dice. It's fairly easy to explain and people seem to pick it up really fast.

Update: after more plays it seems to have some balance issues, some paths seem way better than others because they don't require as much workers to function.

Update 2: Sold it because I got Viticulture, which scratches a similar itch for me and I like it a lot more

We were so excited for this game.  The art is lovely.  There is personality in the game - it's funny and inviting.  Perhaps this is why we were overwhelmingly disappointed.

The game balance is crazy.  We played 2 full games with 2 players.  We then proceeded to play another 4 or 5 "mock games" to test strategies because there seems to be a game-breaking strategy.  The Rodeo is the end-all-be-all strategy no matter what we tried.

As is the case with most worker placement games, you have a lot of choices that will inevitably be unavailable to you.  It seems to be more so the case here.  With 2 players you get a lot of choices and you still feel completely suffocated by limited opportunity within the 7 rounds of the game.  At 4+ players it's nearly impossible to go for any more than 1 objective.

If you are looking for a worker placement farming game, choose Caverna instead.

tl;dr: this ain't no [thing=31260][/thing]

A worker placement game about farming will always bring comparisons to Agricola. But that doesn't mean they're expected to be similar.
This is a pretty typical WP game. You have a number of workers and there are different locations with a varying amount of open spots. The locations are executed in a fixed order. You get resources, you get to convert them into other resources or money. That kind of thing.
I found this game serviceable. It works fine, but there's not really much new or exceptional here. The the way the actions are ordered will require you to do proper planning, so that's nice, but it's not enough to stand out.

I really wanted to like this one, as the bits are great and I tend to enjoy this sort of worker-placement game. Unfortunately, Mi Tiera: New Era has numerous balance issues, including a built-in advantage for the players (limited to two) who get their extra worker first, and for those who roll well. The runaway leader problem also can be amplified if a good bonus card randomly flips up for a player (for example, an early card that produces milk for the rest of the game for an owner of cows can propel that player to victory, while a player who randomly choose to raise chickens is randomly left in the dust). Just poor design and play-testing here ... all of this game's flaws could have been easily avoided.

Worker placement farm sim with a dice rolling luck element. Farmer with the most pesos wins. This is a 2.0 reprint. Placing workers on intersections to double an action or give a choice of options is a differentiating mechanic from other games of this type. A similar placement choice that I like is the first pick with lower action value trade off. This farm sim does a great job integrating a business layer of converting raw commodities into goods & foodstuffs. This adds more depth to strategy decisions that I like a lot.  Other unique features of play are; irrigating fields on your personal farm board, buying from the black market, farming upgrades, and filling a city contract. The rodeo is a sideline activity that you cannot ignore.

Really solid components and I love the art style. But after a playing it a few times I've come to that conclusion that it's really not that great of a game. Lots of different systems that really don't work that well together, and some very obvious approaches that are better than the rest (this is with the no dice variant & advanced). Probably not long for the shelves.

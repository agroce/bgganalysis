Wow - lots going on here, especially at the start :-)  Does resemble phalanx movement (strong at front, weak at flanks), which is a neat bit of thematic integration (/pasting!). Can end very quickly...

RATING: 7
A very tense abstract game where every mistake can be brutally punished. It can seem pretty unusual and surprising for a new player, with the phalanxes able to dart away over the board, but after a while one starts appreciating the depth and complexity. Very, very simple rules, as all the great abstracts are supposed to have. Highly recommended.

Part Abalone and part chess, based on a design in Gamut of Games from Sid Sackson.   Can be hard to grasp at first, but easily understood after a few games.

(Preliminary rating)

Robert Abbott, the designer of this game, wrote an excellent essay in 1975 about "clarity" in games. It's titled "Under the Strategy Tree" and can be found here: http://www.logicmazes.com/games/tree.html

Beautiful wooden board and great quality large plastic? bits.
Tense. No room for a misstep. Every move after the first couple of turns is filled with angst.

Epaminondas is an interesting type of crossing game with a cool movement mechanism and an awkward name. It's more lively that for instance Murus Gallicus or Breakthrough. One thing I'm not too fond of is how the sudden death victory condition creates locally tactical and anticlimactic situations at the end.

Liked this quite a bit on the first go. Don't think I should rate it higher than Lines of Action off the bat, but I underestimated the awesomeness of the rule determining the end of the game, and need to examine this one further.

Wonderfully simple yet deep abstract.  Excellently implemented at www.superdupergames.org.  NestorGames version newly in print.  It's a shame I'm quite so bad at this one . . .

RATING: 10
After a couple of twitches on the already rather good fight/position game Crossings, Bob Abbott came out with this fierce abstract, faultlessly balancing clarity and economy of rules with both surprising depth and relentless aggressive play in a way that has very few matches (Fanorona comes to mind). The end condition works brilliantly.

RATING: 6
Astratto molto duro che si gioca su una scacchiera in stile dama ma di forma rettangolare. L'obiettivo del gioco è raggiungere il bordo opposto di gioco prima dell'avversario e in caso di arrivo contemporaneo bisogna arrivare con più pedine. Il gioco è uno scontro tra falangi dove la falange più potente vince ed elimina le pedine avversarie. Gioco semplice nel regolamento ma molto profondo.

Nicely designed abstract.  It has a clever movement system. As the game progresses it is constantly infused with a sense of impending doom, but it is hard to get overly excited about it, as it can come down to a mathy result.

Terrible name

Probably a deep game with some interesting strategies, but to the beginner it is too long and repetative.

RATING: 8
This one has potential. I need to try it a few more times, but it has a good straight ahead style with (I suspect) some hidden depth.
UPDATE: After another play I'm left with very positive feelings. The game plays surprisingly quick, and in two stages. At first, players are maneuvering for position. But once someone makes the first capture, there is an explosion of action with surprise attacks often coming from the diagonal flanks.

A vicious, pure, simple abstract strategy game, in which every move has brutal implications.  It strikes me as one which doesn't conceal much mystery, despite the very interesting "phalanx" movement mechanism.  Also, though I like the elegance and fairness of the victory condition, in practice, it turns into attrition or surrender (or idiotic forgetfulness), neither of which is particularly pleasurable or painless for the loser.

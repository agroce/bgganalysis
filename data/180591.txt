After playing with 4 people, my rating went up 1 to a 7. Much more enjoyable with 4 players.

I really like that you can have a solid plan, but it all depends on how quick you are with flipping over the tiles - and you need to be a little lucky that you and your opponents didn't remove the tiles that you may need to satisfy the commoners.

Unter bestimmten Voraussetzungen ist Tumult Royal ein sehr schönes Familienspiel, das den Spielern keine schwierigen Entscheidungen, dafür aber umso mehr Geschwindigkeit und Merkfähigkeit gepaart mit ein wenig Fingerspitzengefühl abverlangt. Um es zu mögen, sollte man an Reaktionsspielen grundsätzlich Spaß haben. Und wie alle Spiele dieser Gattung funktioniert es am besten, wenn die Teilnehmer diesbezüglich etwa gleich stark sind.

RATING: 5
A fun light game that can be good as an introduction to the hobby or with lighter/family gamers. It borders on the repetitive, but it plays quick enough that it doesn't overstay it's welcome. It's always fun to see who will end up paying the price for being too greedy.


Like Gordon Gecko said in the 1987 film Wall Street; "Greed is Good". In Tumult Royale "Greed is Good; Sometimes"!

Picked this up on a lightning deal on Amazon Prime Day 2016.  Otherwise, not sure I would have bumped into it for a long time.  

The creator is the same as Settlers of Catan.  There are some similarities in the theme--pick up resources and then buy statue locations with the resources.

This falls into the family genre because of two heavy randomizers:  

1) The 20 second time creates and frantic grab for resources.  There is some strategy going into it, but it gets thrown out the window based on availability, the crazy fast clock, and you forgetting what you already have.

2) The "tumults" can really bonk a player.  If you happen to be the greediest (which can happen, at times, with an amazingly low number), your ability to place statues in that round is dramatically reduced.  Getting behind in a round doesn't put you in a for-certain losing position, but it is really hard to come back.  It also just leaves you feeling bummed out.  

If you settle into a light strategy game with just about as much luck, then this will do great for you.  If you prefer stronger control via your strategy, you will get pretty frustrated at times.  

Overall, glad I have it.  We will break it out from time to time.

Fun to play, but has a pretty low ceiling as the game is very repetitive.   The main mechanism hinges upon a race to grab tiles from the center of the table, but without taking too many (or else the penalties for hoarding can be huge).   The combo of tile-grab with push-your-luck is pretty original.   The rest of the game is a bit bland and a bit long and a bit same-y.    I don't think this will have a long enough shelf life to justify owning.

Simultaneously grab resources from a hidden shared pool but stop at the right moment because bad things will happen to the most greedy player if the pool is drained too much.

A fun premise, and a couple of fun turns, but it gets repetitive really quickly (not a problem for a single game but motivational problems for future plays).

After one play I was very impressed with how much fun this game was. It's just a super smooth and fun game to learn, with a very small amount of down time as half of the game is simultaneous. I would say less depth than Catan but more than king of Tokyo, as a reference.

Beim ersten Spiel dachte ich... Wie öde.

Es geht in diesem Spiel darum am meissten Statuen zu bauen und zwar bevor das Spiel zu Ende ist. Das Ende ist dabei "variabel" und richtet sich nach dem Siegpunktabstand des Führenden verglichen mit dem Letzten.
Aus einer Auslage an verdeckten Plättchen grabschen alle Spieler gleichzeitig nach den 3 verschiedenen Ressourcen in 3 Wertigkeiten. Nachdem der 30 Sekundentimer abgelaufen ist hat nun hoffenlich jeder seine Beutre vor sich liegen. Es wird nachgeschaut ob noch genug Plättchen in der Mitte verblieben sind. Falls ja ist alles ok, doch falls nicht muss derjenige Spieler, der die meissten Ressourcen hat alles bis auf das schwächte Plättchen abgeben. Es folgt eine Baurunde in der man Statuen mit den gegrabschten Ressourcen auf dem Plan bauen darf und danach folgt eine neue Runde. Die Bedingung für das Spielende wird in späteren Runden immer enger, wodurch das Spielende plötlich eintreten kann.
In der Folgerunde wäre ich vermutlich König geworden, hätte 3 Statuen ins Schloss und eine auf eine Wiese bauen können und hätt vielleicht sogar noch Dominik überholt. Durch das plötzliche Ende, weil ein Spieler vorgeprescht ist, war es mir nicht mehr möglich... grrr!
Mir gefällt das Spiel sehr gut. Die Hektikphase ist minimal, die Bauphase recht einfach und das Spiel spielt sich flott und locker.

Gute Mischung aus Hektik (20-30 Sekunden) und Taktik. Nehm ich lieber wenig um nicht gierig zu werden oder nehm ich viele kleine... nur 1 großes Plättchen?????
Wann forciere ich (bzw. versuche zu forcieren) einen Spielerreihenfolgenwechsel? Wenn ich vor einer Burg stehe und mein Gegner auch, sollte ich nach dem Zug mehr Gefolgsleute haben als er.

RATING: 6
Fun in the frantic scramble for tiles and the jeering at "who was the greediest", but the remainder of the game is Euro enough to allow for some strategy and arguably slow down the game play with a few tedious calculations (especially everyone tallying followers for turn order). Does not outstay its welcome and works as a family game.

Based on the rulebook, I was certain that the realtime phase just can't work at all. Surprisingly, it does seem to function quite well enough during the game anyway. There are also some decent timing considerations on the board play.

Tho' it is really a 'family' game, this game is interesting because it models greed mechanics quite well and in a way that differs markedly from other 'push your luck' games.

A game I bought on a whim and heard some good things about. It was cheap enough where I didn't feel guilty for buying it even though I knew nothing about it. Sort of speed collection game but then area control and placement. Trying to get many statues on the board. Only played the one time and enjoyed it. Unclear on how much replay value there is after a few games. Interested in playing a few more times to find out!

RATING: 6
Real-time scramble for bits, with a subsequent resolution phase or two afterwards which is structurally like a certain other game, but I had much more fun playing this than Galaxy Trucker. The importance of the quickfire push-your-luck warrants a pause before the timer starts so that everyone can plan ahead; otherwise, two supporters are scant compensation for a missed building. A little bit of experience learning this with my son led to a relatively comfortable victory on game night, but that in itself shows that there is can be a good mix of skill and judgement to Tumult Royale that can come with repeat plays.

Not a bad game by any means, it just didn't spark for us. I thought that the mechanic of drawing tiles under a timer would be exciting but I found that it made my brain freeze up. Over all the game just felt too light.  The tiny tiny statues were a little disappointing.  They are easy to drop because of their tiny size.  Aren't statutes supposed to be tall?!  The castle playing boards were cool and the artwork reminded me of School House Rock - very fun graphics!

Even though the theme is fairly pasted on the rule book did an excellent job at making the game feel thematic. Actually the rule book was excellent - very clear and easy to understand. Probably the best I have seen.

So over all a good game, just not one I will keep.

The gimmick is everything here, and it is a good one. This is the Galaxy Trucker thing of grabbing tiles real-time. If you keep this moving at a good speed, it is fun. I use the app timer for two things: the grabbing, of course, but also for the "planning," to steer off any AP. 20 seconds to plan, then 20 seconds to grab. Let's go.

1 play, 2er

Light, quick-playing game. The tile draw phase is fun, if somewhat random. Once you get the turn sequence down, the rest of the turn goes quickly as well. The game does, however, start to feel somewhat repetitive: you're not really building much on previous work; rather, you're doing the same thing repeatedly. Maybe it's better with more players?

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Start the game by placing one structure on the board. Each turn starts with a race under time pressure to grab resource tiles (3 types; 1-3 value each tile; 3n removed randomly from the pool each turn). It's sort of like Galaxy Trucker or Mondo, with a push-your-luck element: grab too much and you might be penalized! The citizens' demand is randomly determined at start of turn (by a spinner; 2-4). 

After tile grab, for each resource: if the total remaining in the pool is less than the demand, whoever grabbed the most must discard all but the worst tile! The frenetic phase is followed by a more typical area grab: in turn order until everyone passes, use the resources you collected to expand your presence on the board by building statues (1-3 per space, according to type of space) orthogonally adjacent to one of your previously built structures. Cost varies by terrain type. Use your resource tiles to pay. If you overpay, earn 1 citizen per extra resource. All used tiles are discarded.

Then, adjust turn order according to citizen support. The new king (first in turn order) loses 5 citizens but places one statue on the turn track. Some turns will reveal additional board space (face down tiles, placed at start, flipped up). Later turns might trigger game end if the difference, in count of built statues, between the players with the most and least built, exceeds some threshold (printed on turn track) -- whoever built the most statues wins. The game can also end instantly if someone builds their 25th statue.

This is one my wife had read about and thought would be fun for the family. The tile grabbing aspect was a big hit with the kids and it's always fun to see who will end up paying the price for being greedy. This part I'm not that good at since I rarely pick up enough resources for fear of causing the Tumult so I don't end up building enough statues, thus losing the game. But when playing with people that get greedy, it can work in my favor.

Negatives:  It's a bit fiddly.  There is constant movement of parts and pieces in the game.  The first game felt awkward and a bit contrived and "rocky."  I referred constantly to the summary card/castles.   There is a definite runaway leader problem, BUT (see positives)

Positives:  Plays very quickly, but leaves me with a feeling like I've played something with more depth.  Oddly, I actually like the fiddly-ness of the game.  Spin the spinner, flip the timer, look under the tiles with one hand, build statues, etc. etc.  It's a very busy game and really, never a dull moment.  Once you get into the swing of the phases, the game has a rather addictive momentum to it.  I have a 5 and 7 year old (boys) and I would never try to teach this family game to them.  They have learned tons of other games that are family games.  Maybe for slightly older, but.. not yet for them.  The game takes care of the runaway leader problem by setting up an early winner option based on point differences.  Very clever!  I was wiping my wife off the board but, thankfully, the game cut us off before it became Monopoly-esque.

Surprisingly quite fun given the nature of the game where players compete blindly for resources from a central pool of tiles ala Galaxy Trucker. Players who are the greediest will suffer the most penalties as each one is racing to build monuments on a modular, grid-based game board. The game is also quite short with a fair bit of luck in determining whether the right resources are collected. But because the game is short, the tension for picking tiles are quite palpable.In the end, the game is prone to large swings and luckily there is a mercy to rule to terminate the game given the differential scores between the leader and laggard. 

Overall a fun little nugget that  should be slightly quicker. The 20 second sand timer truly needs to be overhauled

Kind of torn on this one. It's a poor game at 2p, but it seems like it would be a fun and social 4p game with the right people. Think Augustus type weight. If you have 4p who like games like that then this is great. If not, stay away.

This is a fun but somewhat light game.  Once you get the order of play down, it moves along pretty quickly.  Although there is a lot of luck involved, there is some strategy as well as my wife proved when she beat me the other night.  We had some good laughs after robbing the peasants and then being punished for being too greedy.  Also, deciding what to rob from the angry commoners can tax the mind as you try and keep track of what you have already stolen and still need to steal.  Although I have only played it a couple of times, I believe it will be a good addition to my small, but growing, collection.

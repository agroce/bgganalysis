Boards are a bit warped (should be able to be flattened out), some of the figures are leaning (but all are present and none are broken), and all dice and books are present.  Box has some shelf wear, with the lid a bit dished.  Complete.
Traded away at GameStorm16 math trade for Dynasties.

I got some good use out of this basic adventure book.  The kids and I taught many of their friends to play D&D using this set, so it was great for what it was.  Now that I'm not playing D&D any more I just don't have the motivation to pull this out any more to teach someone D&D.

Another introductory set to Dungeons and Dragons.  Sort of surprised this is on BoardGameGeek, as this is most certainly a role-playing game.  The general direction of the revised edition has been towards tactical miniature-driven battles, with all the good and bad that entails.  

NOTE:  Since I greatly enjoy using the game tracking of BoardGameGeek, this game represents sessions of role-playing games in general.  Planning to use the new collection tool to log specific games.

UPDATE: Dungeons and Dragons is a classic - certainly my favorite RPG.  With the advent of RPG geek, I'm going to track RPG plays there.  I'll have to migrate these over at some point.

[b]2006 edition[/b] components: 12 painted miniatures, 4 sturdy two-sided board tiles, 6 dice, counters, manuals & 6 adventures.
A very enjoyable dungeon crawler with nice [u]D&D3.5E[/u] rules (easier than D&D roleplaying) for 1-5 players. Gameplay close to [i]HeroQuest[/i], perfect for casual gamers (who really won't care about edition). Many encounters (with these lite rules) can be set-up using other D&D tilesets.

RATING: 9
I log all of my D&D 4e RPG plays under this board game entry.  Partly because I got this set dirt cheap and it eventually prompted me to join a real D&D RPG campaign.  Also, my group uses the minis and tiles from this set and the 2006 edition during the tactical fighting scenes.  So... double score!

Went from player to DM very quickly.  Storytelling is my thing and I didn't even know it.  I absolutely love miniatures.  I started buying inexpensive HeroClix (that aren't obvious superheroes or carrying guns) for less than 50 cents each and re-basing them on 25mm bases.  Sweeeet!!! So many miniatures for inspiration and crazy campaigns with all kinds of strange creatures.   Ahhhh....'m gonna faint.

I love this game. I started with AD&D Version 1. The Basic game is quite good, and always love to play it. The later versions I am not terribly fond of, but bear in mind, I'm an old guy and don't like change. This is a requirement in any gamers collection! OK I have to change a bit here.

1st RPG!  Are any chicks reading this review?  Well, if so, I have never heard nor played the game I am about to review.  I repeat, as far as I know, D&D stands for Donuts and Danish or Drift and Drive or even Design and Decor.  Seriously, before all these fancy computer games, my choices growing up were Zork or D&D.  Both rocked.

Fantastic - can be played as a game in itself or a stepping stone to the full game. Can be hard to get hold of in the UK, so you may have to import.

This version is worth getting if you can track it down as it comes with 10 or so miniatures from the D&D miniature line (painted).

RATING: 8
As an intro to [i]D&D[/i], this is great—I could see giving this to kids as the first leg of their journey to Geek Mountain.  My only complaint would be how hard Wizards is pushing minis with this; it would be easy for one to believe that minis are *required* for play, when really all you need is paper, pencils, dice and big, fat imaginations.  All that aside, this boxed set does a great job of laying it all out in an accessible, stair-stepped fashion.

A great gift for kids—especially if you're going to play it with them.

(Comments refer to the 3rd edition.)

:goo:

The 4th edition starter is pretty slick, though it comes with cardboard disks instead of pre-painted minis, which is funny since unlike 3rd edition, 4th edition REQUIRES the use of minis and a battle grid...  The game has morphed considerably from starter RPG to tactical dungeon combat simulator with this edition.  Not a bad thing—it's good at what it does—but personally I like to keep my tactical minis games and RPGs as far away from each other as possible.

I never played D&D growing up, so it is hard for me to get into as an adult. Plus, some of the group I do it with doesn't take it very seriously, so it makes it that much harder. Pretty much, you should never buy the basic game. You need for someone else to take you under their D&D fold, and teach you the ways. Then go for the advanced books, or create your own story.

When I began D&D in 1983 I was but a learner, now I AM THE MASTER. Of course my modified rules don't line up with the official modern game, but back in the game's early days it was always part of the designers' plan that we players make it our own. I use this edition as the basis for incorporating miniatures into my campaigns.
This version will be my focus for posting about the RPG since I will always throw it in with board games (and RPGgeek is blah). Therefore my "10" here is for D&D overall.

2-5 I've heard about this game my whole life but never played before. Partly because of the hype and partly because I never really "got" it. As a game that's primarily script and imagination based there is little tangible to pull you into the game at times which gives me room for my mind to wander. I think the more people you have playing the more interactive it becomes and therefore the more fun.

Picked this up for $20 AUD (2006 Ed.) - A bargain for what you get. It also lead me to the D&D Player's Kit which you can buy for under $15 USD with a free Aberrations Booster included. This kit also includes the D&D Players Handbook (soft cover) which is useful even for other (non D&D) d20 games. My only complaint would be the "world's best fantasy role playing game" quote in the rulebook - possibly the RPG with the highest retail sales but I don't know about best fantasy RPG.

Oddly enough I use the dice and miniatures from this to suppliment my Pathfinder: ACG games.  Note to self, if I ever wonder where the dice went... They're in the Pathfinder box.

As an intro for D&D it's excellent.  As a one off boardgame, it holds up nicely and is plenty of fun.

RATING: 5.3
It gave a basic feel of what D&D was like. 
Played a little of the adventures, and got myself 
the Player's Book,  Monster Manual,
Dungeon Master Guide and  Forgotten Realms book by 
jumping on the WotC band wagon.....but for some
reason i never played it that much. 

In my gaming groups nobody was that interested 
in playing. I like to roleplay.....for a few sessions. But not to take on as a whole hobby in general.

Ok honestly.  Are there any Gen-X'rs on this site that haven't at least played this game?  The grandaddy that started my addiction to gaming at age 12.  Fairly easy to learn, can get as advanced as players want.  Must play in person though with proper atmosphere to really enjoy.  One of the most versatile games ever.  Taught me reading difficult words and expanded my imagination immensely.

The basic game was boring and included almost no roleplaying at all. Plus, the mechanics were for starting players and included none of the awesome and fun customization that rulebooks allowed. Still, it is D&D and was the start of the d20 system, which gives it some cred.

now the orignal basic set (red box) and it's followups boxe sets WITH floorplans and miniatures was great (in nostalgic view).

rose tinted glasses aside it still played better than this set which is FAR too basic.

I have an old edition.  I think is a perfect way to learn to play D&D.  The problem is you can get used to the tiles, the miniatures and the pre written story, whilst you loose the most beautiful part of the D&D RPG: the imagination.

It's nice for introducing players to a simplified version of D&D. It doesn't have a big replay value, though, which subtracts from the final rating.

Version 3.5 is, in my opinion, the pinnacle of the D&D game system... greater flexibility than previous additions, not "dumbed-down" like 4.0

I was a Master-level DM in the RPGA during their 'Living Greyhawk' campaign! Shame it ended with the release of 4.0

A bit of a disappointment, I purchased this mainly for use with the collectible D&D Miniatures game (1.0).  Annoyingly though, the miniatures that come with this box are for the most part outclassed by the vast majority of other minis in the game.  The cardboard dungeon tiles at least are nice enough, both for the RPG as well as for skirmish scenarios.

Basically, if you're buying it for roleplaying purposes, go for it, but if you want it primarily for use in the skirmish game then your money is better spent elsewhere.

Ah c'mon guys at WOTC! We aren't stupid. This box has nothing.
I've been allured when I was living in Asia and saw that Big Red Box on the bookshelf. I purchased right away. 
Holy crap! Kkakakakka.

This is a decent introduction to D&D.  It is definately not worth the $25 retail, but I got it for $17 and don't regret it.  It is not meant to be totally satisfying, it is meant to get you to want more and it does that well.

This is the game that Wizard's of the Coast used at conventions for their Beginner D&D meets.

I miss pouches of polyhedra. I miss committing to months of D&D adventuring 3/4 nights a week with my friends. I miss [b][i]The Queen of the Demonweb Pits, Castle Amber, The Temple of Death, Dwellers of the Forbidden City, The Lost City, The Isle of Dread, The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh, Tomb of the Lizard King, Ravenloft, Desert of Desolation, and The Temple of Elemental Evil.[/i][/b] I miss describing the sights, smells, and sounds, emanating from the dungeon of a Slavelord. I miss THACO and saving throws. I miss Vorpal Swords, Wands of Magic Missiles, and Platemail Armour+3. I miss all those things.

That out of the way, this game is the latest generation of the D&D Starter set (in 2004), which includes GREAT board tiles, pre-painted miniatures, a cast-iron set of RPG rules, and a smattering of components.
I have both Basic sets (Blue & Black Dragon) because the tiles are noticably different.
What's the difference? Well, FYI, the Parker D&D boardgame tiles are all basically filled with squares to explore, divided by the odd wall. The boards from this game (both editions) are laid out like a top-down view of winding caves, etc. They are very nice indeed, with added details like fallen pillars and tiled floors. Out of the two, the blue dragon tiles are superior.

I am primarily a roleplayer, or was until I moved away from my regular group and discovered the Geek by chance. D&D is my biggest love, maybe because it was the 2nd system I played after finding Tunnels & Trolls many, many moons ago. I always preferred DMing to playing - that maybe because I was never satisfied with the adventures I was asked to participate in. Shame.

I spent months crafting scenarios for my group to explore, and it proved a very rewarding pasttime. We NEVER used miniatures. Ever. I felt that the experience was heightened when described and imagined; a kind of consensual daydream-state. Also, you can bend the situations, to smooth the playing, when things are not as cut-and-dried as they are when you can see how far a goblin archer is down the corridor, by counting flagstones and repostioning models. I like describing the result of each combat roll - all of that can get lost when you're pushing your dwarven barbarian model around a model dungeon, interrupted by the clatter of tossed D20s. Having said that, there are many benefits to the use of miniatures. From a purely aesthetic POV there is an awful lot to be admired in a well-dressed dungeon complex, replete with ivy-covered columns and miniature Jaws of Death traps. That is where the D&D Basic game leaps in...

This rambling history lesson brings me to the D&D boardgames and their pretenders. I play straight D&D as written above: no maps or models. But, if I want a few evenings of dungeon-bashing, then moving dragons, elves, goblins, and hobbits about funky map tiles is definitely the way to go!

BTW, I have played Descent and I was disappointed. The presentation and artwork was awesome. The rules left me cold. Don't think that I hate FFG; I love Runebound. I just wanted a better FEEL to the game. I'm sure that you've read my comments elsewhere.

Looking back on my DMing days, I can now see why, without a group to run, I have shifted into writing books. DMing, and writing, are all about forging worlds for the participants. I suppose it's a natural progression...

Have no doubt cloud your mind, however, this game is GOOD; a fantastic gateway into the land of fantasy roleplaying. You get dice, figures, gameboards, and a solid set of rules for your money here. Unlike Descent, Dungeon, etc, you have to put some work into playing this game, but certainly not mounds of effort, shambling or otherwise! If this edition had come out when I was at school - rather than the old "Red Dragon" Basic set - I'd have been a VERY happy bunny indeed. This is a triumph in smart marketing, flawed only by a lack of cross-pollination with the D&D Miniatures rules. Buy this game.

Chiefly, D&D trumps Descent in many ways, mainly in pace. D&D allows the players time to breathe between fights and explore (which is half the fun of adventuring) the dungeons - without daft opportunities to beam back to a town and heal. In Descent, the DM's role is to kill the players, making EVERY room and corridor a combat-heavy slog. Sure, D&D is all about the fights too, but in D&D the DM wants the players to enjoy themselves, and every adventure needs pace, like a story.

Descent has another fatal error in its design that destroys a good deal of the dungeon-crushing fun: it lays out the whole bloody map at the start. Very bad idea for atmosphere, but terrific for speedy games.

When you go delving, hoping to slaughter dark elves and murder skeleton archers on the way, you gain a huge amount of pleasure from having the world unfold. Descent has no mystery, no pause. In D&D you can let the pace be dictated by the way the session is progressing. Sometimes it's nice just to wander crypts, with just the expectation of traps, etc, keeping everyone excited. Descent reminds me of the scene in Kentucky Fried Movie where the kung-fu bloke chops down a horde of warriors; every time he looks up, another screaming battalion descends on him. That IS Descent.

D&D can be a great adventure played out on boards (sometimes); Descent is just a boardgame.

[My comments concern Descent 1st edition.]

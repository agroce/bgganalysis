I've only tried this solo. Fun at first, then becomes quite dull. It [i]does[/i] do a good job of simulating a zombie invasion, with the zombies clumping up and attacking en masse. But it's very difficult, and it takes a long, long time to win (a short time to lose). I wish there were a decent computer implementation of this; that would be more fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This took some effort to build out, but it was worth it.  Fun, simple game.  I played Zombicide after experiencing this game and I have to say it seems a lot of the gameplay ideas seem borrowed from this.  The implementation is slightly different, but very similar.  Great work by the creators.

I followed the excellent tutorial: [thread=327882][/thread] posted by [user=kwanchai][/user] to build my copy.  I find that the components for [thing=29368][/thing] and [thing=32248][/thing] really add depth.  A light, fun romp, and am looking forward to playing this again w/ a few more human players.

1st play: 2 player game, and   "The Cellar" was pulled relatively early, and the game became more of a tactical maneuvering / race than a toe-to-toe battle I expected.

2nd play: 3 player game, and again, "The Cellar" was pulled early.  After the game, one of the players suggested that after the deck is prepared, cut it in half & shuffle "The Cellar" into the bottom half of the deck.

'Print and Play' Boardgame. After constructing another PnP game (Phantom's Vortex) and being disappointed, I was leary on putting this one together. I was pleasantly surprised. This is not a bad game, and the price (free) is not too bad either. We play with a bag of plastic "Zombies!" minis (4 of which are painted in solid colors for the "Humans" side).

I got suckered in to this by the game's more enthusiastic fans. I was into The Walking Dead both in graphic novel and on TV, and I wanted a new zombie game besides LNOE. I love LNOE, don't get me wrong, but I wanted something fully cooperative, and I was excited to see you could play this one as a coop, plus I like the action point system. I had a copy printed up for me.

This "game" is basically a sandbox for you to create your own game, be it competitive or cooperative. We messed around with some rules for the coop game and had a few OK sessions, but in general it's way too flat of an experience without enough of an infrastructure to provide anywhere near a rich experience. It's just a system for moving and attacking, but you need to provide scenarios with objectives. There also needs to be an event deck or some mechanism that constrains the players or otherwise creates tension and tells a story. This is a system in need of a story around it.

While fooling around with house rules can be fun, I eventually lost enthusiasm. And with the release of some new zombie games recently, there doesn't seem to be much of a point trying to create something here.

There's a reason why it's free.  Some rule tweaks are needed, since we spent about 45 minutes in a deadlocked dicefest before we gave up.  After trying to fix that, I may re-evaluate.

RATING: 7
Not bad, it DOES have zombies at least. But it felt a little too simple to me. I only got to play it 1 on 1 (with my fiancee) though, and the game does say it&#039;s better with more players. Our first game was over in less than 5 minutes! Also, the cards look kind of blurry (not just because of printing) so we had to keep checking the rules for what everything does. Pretty annoying. I&#039;ll likely give it another shot if I can scrape together a few more players for it next time.

 The "Space Hulk" 1 AP to turn left/right component coupled with the 4 AP limit on the players brings the game to a shambling crawl (pun intended).  I would recommend either a 6 AP point allowance or 1/2 pt cost for turning for Survivors. Variable movement might be more interesting.
 
 A set of basic programming rules could be written for the Zombies so the game could be made into a pure co-op.

 Otherwise, the game and its components are ok.

A good light zombie game where one player plays to zombies, the others play the humans and try to find the car keys and escape. The zombies are very slow and have hard time killing the players, but if the humans don't move quick, they are in for a world of hurt as the endless tide of zombies comes crashing against the house walls... Easy to teach, clocks in usually under an hour and is loads of fun, but is print-and-play too. The board I made myself is very crappy, do a better job with your own, it adds to the replay value too as mine has began to fall apart already!

RATING: 9.4
My rating(s): 
6.5 - original game. A problem example in my play: an unarmed human is cornered & trapped but only 1 zombie can attack him because of the obstacles layout. With the zombie's weak attack, they attack each other with no result for many, many, many turns!
8.5 - Kwanchai's version with the Shorter Game variant (the file is in BGG). I choose 32 cards for the game and update some of the cards (example: make the water gun a bit better and can be refilled if adjacent to a water square or sink or bathup, etc).
9.4 - I made a Tracking Sheet (included: a search square track for each human, the Cellar, rules reminder, and color marks for solo play) + Zombies!!! components (the zombies, humans, and the tokens to track everything including barricades). I shrink all 4 maps to fit in Zombies!!! box. Two games in one!

Each game is exciting, it's like watching a zombie movie. There are always epic, desperate fights against the zombies. Sometimes one or two humans escape alive with the vehicle or successfully barricaded themselves in a room, but sometimes the zombies eat 'em all, like in my last game. It's rare all humans alive till the end. Great game!

RATING: 7

RATING: 9
This is an extremely tense game that plays as a mix between a puzzle game and a tactics game and has a [b]huge[/b] amount of theme.

A puzzle game because the zombie movement is somewhat predictable.  Getting from Point A to Point B requires a bit of thinking.  As the game goes on, more and more zombies come on the map, making the puzzle more "dangerous".

A tactics game because attacks are resolved through dice and because zombies might not end up doing exactly what you thought they would.

Have only played with the original house map. We play with the cellar expansion and with the "How Boring" rule.  The "How Boring" rule really seems to add some tension and makes the players take a few risks they might not have otherwise ("I'll attack once before backing away from the pack of zombies...").  

When we have three or four people that are going to play, we usually play one person as the zombie player, and the rest as human players, each getting [b]two humans apiece[/b].

We also play that the humans only need to barricade themselves in one room of the house after searching everywhere (they don't have to clear and barricade the whole house).

[ImageID=564096]
Near the end game, the zombie player stops having as many meaningful decisions (where to place zombies, less humans to "redirect" zombies) so I've been thinking up some alternate rules...

Another great thing about this game is that it easily plays solitaire as well as up to seven players.

For single-player games, I make the Humans and Zombies each follow set rules. 
Zombies: Move towards visible humans; move towards last human seen; move towards opening.
Humans: Find a weapon; barricade the house; stay alive.   :-) 

However, I could see this becoming repetitious after multiple playthroughs.. 

One word for those without figurines: LEGO. I have a stock of mini-figs with enough skull/troll heads to make a good supply of Humans and Zombies. Plus, the Humans can hold whichever weapon they have uncovered.

A well-designed game with lots of tense, nail-biting moments.  I recommend downloading the 10th anniversary cards and pieces, and using their AP rules.  Don't forget to download all the game boards too.

I augmented my game with re-based zombie miniatures from Horrorclix, and created player pawns using modified victim tokens from the same game.  It always goes over well with my group!

It's definitely been worth the effort to print and 
play Zombie Plague. We altered the rules to our 
liking and created characters with various attributes
rather than having identical pawns. We've had three plays
so far with the Zombies winning one when the teamwork fell through. I prefer the original, more cartoony board art but the cards from Kwanchai's update are far superior.

I'd call this more of a set of tools for creating your own zombie game than a solid title in its own right. Still I'm giving it a 9 since it's a great source of freely available Zombie related goodness and if you're willing to put some time into reworking the rules then it can be a lot of fun, rolling that zombification dice is not to be taken lightly!

I anticipate the board set up and scenario getting old fast though so I'll have to devise some alternative objectives and win conditions.

This game is a hoot- turns out that Ben at least likes co-ops a lot. It often feels 'just in time' when you slap a barricade up as a zombie tries to come through a window at you.  Definitely going to print up a nice copy and try out some of the other maps.  And make people and zombie versions of the family;)

RATING: 6
The game was decently fun given the people and Halloween. Quite a bit of randomness in searching items/events, but theme and mechanics worked pretty well together. Biggest problem is that the zombie player doesn't have a lot of good decision-making possibilities. Also player elimination is a big problem.

Working on getting it together, but a little reluctant after having sank some money into Zombies!!!  But I've heard this and Last Night on Earth are much better.  And my group really enjoys the collaborative style games.

Update: Nice game.  Indeed better than Zombies!!!

The one thing I like about this game: it manages to create a Zombie vibe with really simple rules. However, the rules are so simple that this isn't much of a game after all, and the baroque "combat system" (if one can call it such...roll doubles on two dice? why not just a 6 on one die??), leading to deadlocks resolved by random repeated rolling is more than I can bear with. Possibly this contributes to the overall Zombie feel too, but I don't find it that interesting.

A very simple, and very fun, B-movie type zombie adventure, as the player(s) try to keep the continual streams of slow-moving undead from taking over the house, church, island, cellar etc - or to escape in the car (if they can find the car keys, or hotwire it with a screwdriver.  It basically uses simple 'dungeon-crawler' mechanics (like HeroQuest and many other games), where you search for items, fight the zombies off, and RUN!  A great little Print 'n' Play game, that you can play with miniatures, and there are also many nice fan modifications and variants.  Highly recommended

Man, I've put literally dozens of hours into this game!  Assembling 3 copies (2 as gifts, 1 for sale), painting figures for all of them, re-writing the entire rulebook... perhaps my expectations were unreasonably high as a result of all that work!  I've played 2 games (one 2-player with 2 heroes each, and one 4-player with 1 hero each), and with both games I mostly just felt relieved when the game was over.  Both games were fairly easy wins for the heroes (1 "Cellar" escape in the Church board and 1 "Boat" escape in the Island board), with 1 hero being zombified in the first game and none in the second.  Truthfully, I've never been into zombies, so the theme didn't have a huge amount of appeal either.  For a "print 'n' play" game, it IS pretty amazing (particularly with the newer artwork by BGG user kwanchai).  In my opinion, it's even better than "Last Night on Earth: The Zombie Game" because it is less reliant on card play and more reliant on board movement, but neither game impressed me that much.  With Zombie Plague, there are very few interesting decisions for players to make in the game, putting it high on the "experience game" end of the scale (for those who are into zombies), and very low on the "strategy" end.  I'm rarely at a loss to figure out what could be done to improve game play, but this time I am!  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment; 2/5  Total: 5.5/10

This was my zombie game until I built Dead of Night, now I prefer that one.  This is still a nice game because of the simplicity.  Easier to bring out for non-gamers if you want to get started quickly.

Light, humorous and very fun beer & pretzels game. We use the mini's from "Zombies". It's worth doing a good job mounting the board, etc - very nice visually!

RATING: 7
Game was a pretty big hit. Everybody liked the team concept and the way the humans could run about pretty much unscathed unless they rolled an oops. I proposed Changing the AP's to Human - 5 and Zombie 3 to slightly close the speed gap as double speed seemed to mean that zombies could only attack if a human attacked first AND rolled an oops.

RATING: 7
Fun, free, and playable by non-hardcore gamers. It has a really high luck factor (gameplay is mostly rolling dice), but still fun and true to zombie movies. Easy to create house rules. It is recommended to download and print additional boards (which can be found in BGG), since the original gets old fast.

We play with many and varied sets of rules, so it's hard to give just one rating. If the dice are against you, this game drags to either a loss or watching your buddies succeed. The right atmosphere helps this situation some.

RATING: 4
Played using the Mikey and Baby expansion, but they added limited excitement.  Captures the zombie horror genre too well.  Playing the zombies is extremely boring.  The game can drag on and on, without any interesting decisions required.  Zombie Monopoly Plague?

However, the price is right.

Somewhat reminiscent of the Dawn of the Dead board game, on one team are the humans, while on the other are the zombies. The humans race to barricade all the doors and windows, while searching the house for helpful items. The zombies, on the other hand, just want to eat those tasty humans.

Egy ZS kategóriás zombifilm hangulatát nagyszerűen meg tudja idézni ez a játék. A zombikat irányító játékosnak viszont tudnia kell, hogy ő nem játszik. Csak ész nélkül tologatja a figurákat, meg várja, hogy a többiek egymás után minél több egyest dobjanak. (PNP-BGG)

Great game. My first Zombie game. And my second self-printed one. The atmosphere is great, the mechanics are pretty balanced and the final experience is a 10. Love all the scenarios Kwanchai made plus all the expansion cards. May I recommend the crawlers expansion as a must.

100 times closer to a 'proper' zombie movie than any other 'published' zombie game.

Beats the board games Maul of America, Last Night on Earth & Dawn of the Dead on every count. More streamlined, colourful and above all it's a total blast to play.

Playing with the 'How Boring' variant spices up your games no end, and makes short work of cowardly Human players.

[b]Created Cyberboard version.[/b]

[b]IMHO the best way to play follows the 'NEW OFFICIAL' rulebook:[/b] I've no idea why so many folk needed to re-write something that wasn't broken, and in effect broke it themselves in the process.

Definetly best zombie boardgame. Much better than Last Night on Earth. Much faster & clever than Dead of Night.

Guargame de conductores de cartas (Card driven) muy entretenido.

En la última partida eché de menos los eurogames de partidas rápidas y equilibradas. Ya se me pasará, jeje.

Multiplayer diplomatic games are not my "cup of tea". Saying that:
Two games with three players, and very well impressed!
Great with four players.
A voyage to the past of archaic Rome and its enemies.
The game plays smoothly and any player of Hanibal RvC can play it competently on first time.
Each power have his own deck with its flavour.
Diplomacy rules could be better refined.

6:00-8:00 hours to play all the campaign with four players. Worth it!

RATING: 9
A pleasant surprise in that it was easier than I thought it would be to learn, which was greatly aided by my playing [thing=234][/thing].
The game is tightly balanced, which is incredible considering this is not cube placement/removal and an optimization puzzle, unlike COIN, but rather good old fashioned punch 'em in the mouth/take his land and lay siege to his cities fun of Hannibal.
The non-player activation is a clever idea and spices it up greatly.
I am not big into 3+ players war games, but that is partly because I never played anything like this.  COIN, Axis & Allies, Risk, Napoleonic Wars, and Quartermaster General does not get you too excited to spend the time and effort, ya know?

Jugado por internet. Divertido y lleno de acciones y traiciones que hacen de él un juego trepidante. En una segunda partida me gustó menos. Hay jugadores que se pueden quedar fuera de la partida en una mala tirada de dados. Y hace que sea imposible recuperarse y volver a estar en la partida. En la nuestra ganó el cartaginés a costa de ganarle puntos al Etrusco (Que llegó a desaparecer del mapa). Ideal para una tarde con amigos, pero no más.

I think this game can be a real gem. It is asymmetrical and yet balanced. Want to play it more to get a feel for it.

Revised after a 5 player game: The map and the powers starting positions is flawed it would seem, if the aim is to create a balanced game that is.

RATING: 8.5
Two friends and I set aside a day (6 hours) for our first outing with SoR. We only completed 3 of the (shorter) 6 turn game but we've had a lot of fun - and we were complete novices. 

I'm struggling to remember enjoying a face-to-face game so much. It was easy to get into. The rules appear very clean. A good level of complexity without being too complicated. Fortunes swing one way and then another (but without a sense that it is all down to luck). And inactive players need to watch for response opportunities - so no sitting bored while one player gets on with things.

8.5 is the rating based on a substantial, but incomplete, game. I was tempted to go higher but we'll see.

UPDATE: 5 years later and I finally play again. Another 3 player short game and this time completed in a little over 6 hours (have to wonder why we were so slow last time). Great fun again - we all want to see this on the table again in the near future. 8.5 is probably an accurate score.

RATING: 9
Excellent game with a diplomacy system that really works. Alliances changes fast. I also like the small individual decks. Less happier I am with the combat system. It's far too random and makes every battle a great risk. That can be OK, since that sometimes happens in history, but in our games it happens far too often.

I also wished that there where more markers like the Greek elephants, such as Linen Legion and Phalanx, instead of combat units and cards. That would have looked the game more spicier. A more advanced naval system I would also have appreciated.

Wow, after one four player game this is definitely one to get to the table again. From the beginning there was plenty of action, with multiple plundering, attacks and sieges.

The game is let down somewhat by the rule book and some better organisation and index would greatly assist, along with a card manifest as to play well you need an understanding of each players deck.

Tense and atmospheric with asymmetrical sides. Can be good fun, but...

Players need to know what they're doing. Recognizing the balance of the game and playing accordingly is important, otherwise things will go off the rails quickly (the Romans and Etruscans/Samnites in particular can get crushed if ganged up upon).

Also, battles can be a frustratingly dicey experience.

SoR is just short enough to be fun.  Normally probably a non-starter if it weren't for the short play time.  This is about the maximum amount of time I'm willing to invest in a multi-player game, it runs to about 5-6 hours with the tournament length scenario.

I really like the game but I doubt it could be played in a competitive environment.  There is a large degree of luck and an even larger degree of leader-bashing.  Really it's crucial to never look like you're leading in SoR!

The rulebook is a bit of a turnoff, but once you understood the gameplay with its sequences you will love it. 4 different gamers must exercise 4 different types of strategies. The cards save sometimes your  gameplay, but in return the cards of your enemies ruin it again. Keep your killercards for later or rush the expansion in the beginning? Only the celts can do what celts did best - burn and plunder. GMT at its  best.

RATING: 6
I was impressed by this game the first few times I played it, but after suffering through several hours in a lost position, thanks to being attacked by two players, I've changed my mind. Games that allow players to be ganged up on need to be short or allow for the player to resign, otherwise such a player has to suffer through many hours of a lost position. I think I do prefer Pax Romana after all, because there it is harder to gang up on a player and usually not in anyone's interest to weaken someone too much. 

In Sword of Rome you want to ally with others to assist in taking their victory point spaces away, and once you are too weak everyone else can take a bite too. Fundamentally I don't have an issue with this mechanic, but it is not fun to have to suffer through this situation for 4 hours! SoR is a more complex Diplomacy. Alliances can be made and broken at any time, and everyone can usually strike everyone else. Just not the type of game I enjoy.

I also do not like the an interpretation of the rules that allows the play of DT cards as the Etruscan bribe ability without it counting as a use of a DT card. This seems in direct contradiction to rule 7.4.4 & 7.4.5.

This appears to be a well designed game, although many of the concepts have been directly copied from Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage.  Played my first game, only three players though and was impressed with the game in spite of the fact that it seemed inherently imbalanced with the Gauls missing.

After a second play (with four players) I'd say this game shines.  I can't wait to play again.

Interesting game on a topic I am not familiar with. The only game I have played was with the 5th player expansion, I can't imagine playing without it. This game was unusual as compared to other card driven wargames I've played in that I did not cycle through the deck very many times (just twice, I believe). I am willing to play this again, but need more experience before I can pass final judgement.

Like Here I Stand, this game seems to play much differently depending on which power you are playing, which I like a lot.  Unlike Here I Stand, it seems that there is less diplomacy in this game, and I'm not quite sure how Rome is supposed to make it through the game.  But I'm very willing to try this again.

First,  do not like diplomacy games and second, combats do not work for me. Absolute loses, instead of relative (to the size of involved armies), produce weird results: small battles = total elimination of both sides, while large battles = 20-40% causalities; successful attack on small force produce the same loses to winner as successful attack on large force.

Preliminary comment based on one solo play.  Sword of Rome is the first multiplayer CDG that I have played and wow - there is a lot going on.  Each power has unique advantages and disadvantages.  I suspect this is a game that I will always want to play but will be difficult to get to the table as a result of its longish playtime and moderately high complexity.

One of the best multiplayer wargames I've played. Rules are quite light, player interaction is well studied and nobody is ever out of involvment. Anyway beware for in the shorter version the game is more unforgiving.
Factions strategy is different, so the game should have a long life.
Shorter version is over in 4 hours, longer in 6. This is good to end any match in one session.

EDIT: I adjusted my score, because this game is actually quite good upon replay with a better understanding of deck manipulation, which is important in this game. 

Out of all the CDGs I have played, this is by far the weakest one I've encountered. Strangely bland for such a long game.

A nice rendition of CDG, and overall graceful mechanics and decent balance.  I have played several simplified games with my sons, and a few solo as well.  I understand how hardcore fans might gripe about some gameyness in use of the non-player powers, and I and others have been burned by the crapshoot combat system -- the prime facet that's ripe for a replacement.  But overall, I think this a solid success.

RATING: 8
One of the better multi-player card-driven strategy games. Reminiscent of Hannibal but without the tactics cards. Four factions each of which has its own distinct personality combine to capture the flavor of the period very faithfully. Minor powers are represented and are available to be thorns in the side of your opponents.

One of the minor powers (Carthage) has been re-worked, in a five player expansion, to allow for a fifth player to take part. That and some rules tweaking should re-new interest in this extremely interesting and thematic game. However, in the five-player version the loss of Carthage as a potential foil to Greece can be problematic, to the extent that I would be willing to propose a house-rule that would prevent Greece from allying with Carthage (similar to the rule preventing France and England from allying in "The Napoleonic Wars"). Greece is already one of the stronger factions in SoR and without Carthage to keep them honest, well it wasn't pretty. Granted this observation was based on one play of the expansion whereupon Greece and Carthage promptly allied and even with tacit alliances between the remaining powers against the two, there seemed little holding back Greece who romped to an early AV...

Revisited after a long hiatus and was reminded how brutal and chaotic the combat routines are here. As the S/E faction it is hard to know what to do besides having the Etruscans swat at the Gauls who are raiding you to death (and hoping Rome doesn't gobble you up from behind) - as far as the Sammites are concerned all you can really do is build up and hope the Romans and the Greeks go at each other giving you an opening to do something (anything?). Even then, you have to also hope the Romans don't get the cards that turn their empire into a hedgehog of walled cities. The Gauls are hardly exciting but at least you know what to do with them. Rome is probably the most interesting power to play but is highly dependent of getting key cards early on. The Greeks have it the best as long as they can keep the Carthaginians at bay...

The combat system has evolved slightly - at least you don't have to worry about the indignity of spearing yourself with extra losses when you roll those miserable "ones" which cause you to be the loser and you're taking arrows anyways. I highly recommend players use the optional rule that lets you apply your leader's tactics rating to cancel CU losses. Losing four or five CU in a single battle is extremely hard to come back from...

RATING: 6
Been playing this ftf and through PBEM.  So far I have to give the game a solid "meh".  While the concept is good the combat system feels like a total crapshoot.  I appreciate what the designer was trying to accomplish with it but I think a more conventional combat system would have made for a better game.

The 5p game with Carthage improves the experience, but that wonky cobat resolution system keeps this game from rating higher in my book.

Although in our first game we could only complete 3 turns, initial impressions are very favorable. Rules-wise SoR is very similar to Hannibal:RvsC. However, where the latter is a zero-sum affair, in SoR the different powers add variability, depth and diplomacy. I can see SoR being a big hit in the gaming club. Now if we could only finish our games in one session...

RATING: 6.8
Fun and solid. This is as good as a recreation of this period as you can get but due to the nature of the topic, and not the game itself, has huge amounts of luck. If you get behind early it is a miserable few hours to trundle though as it is difficult to recover. Reinforcements are fairly meagre and there are so many ways to lose units that its very difficult to get ahead once you fall behind. Once again, while realistic and well portrayed, some countries/empires are much more difficult to play and IMHO have little or no chance to win.

RATING: 3
Routine UPDATE: With Spartacus just out from Compass games, re-using essentially verbatim the combat system from Sword of Rome, I feel compelled to update my rating here to point out that the combat system in Sword of Rome is just awful. It's too insensitive: it's almost impossible to get decent DRM advantages under any conditions because large force ratios are impossible to achieve. Combat losses are insensitive to almost all factors, including leadership and force size. So you just end up rolling the dice and taking your chances with hugely swingy results where there is little you can do to make a difference. Compare to Hannibal, where every CU you bring matters, and where leadership has an important and subtle role in combat. I really think that the CRT here is the swamp on which they tried to build this game. It's just a very poor system, so everything else in the game - some of which is pretty interesting - is horribly compromised. The visible back-breaker here is the game length, where you play a 6-8 hour game to get wiped out in the first two by a hugely random CRT, but even if Sword of Rome were only 3 hours, the weird CRT would still undo it I think.
---
Further play keeps stripping away ratings points on this one. I really, really wanted to like it, but it's just not there. It borrows heavily from the rules of Hannibal, without capturing it's soul. If I see another multiplayer wargame in which the best strategy is to hang back and wait for someone else to do something, I'm going to start incinerating things I think. Hannibal was all about the subtlety of province control and the way all the elements of the game (PCs, combat, the card deck) were tied together. Sword of Rome is, sadly, missing almost all of the interconnectedness that made Hannibal work ... so it's just OK.

The show-stopper then becomes the length. I think at half the duration the issues here would be forgivable. But at the length that it is, it's a non-starter.

RATING: 4
Sword of Rome is another new-to-me game that I can attribute to the Greater Boston Grogs (a bunch of really nice guys). Here, I think my lack of wargaming experience was blindingly obvious. 

First, because I'm incapable of multi-tasking, I mostly ended up consolidating all of my units into a single massive army that I marched around the northern side of the board for four hours. I couldn't help but notice that I was the only one who took this tactic.  

Second, although I had gone through the rules earlier that morning, I couldn’t keep them in my head for the life of me and spent most of the game with my nose buried in a spare copy of the rulebook, looking up occasionally to ask if it was my turn. (In my defense, some of the rules were quite fiddly and unintuitive. The requirements for taking Political Control of areas at the end of each turn were different than the requirement for using Ops points to seize control. Some actions, like sieges and raiding used two dice, with the goal of rolling high. Other actions, like end-of-turn attrition used one die, with the goal of rolling low.  )

I considered myself fortunate not to get kicked off table, and was doubly fortunate to finish third (the Estruscan/Samnite player made an ill-advised alliance with Rome and, once he reached 0VP, -- we started with 6 -- spent most of the game trying to drag me down to his level.

The card-driven system and the point-to-point movement were redeeming aspects of the game in my eyes (that, and the asymmetric player powers/incentives). I thought the cards themselves offered too few choices, however. Many events were entirely unplayable at the point at which I drew them. 

A few of the elements that I expected to be defining features of the game (based on my cursory rules read) had almost no meaningful effect. The game provides for three non-player powers, which can be activated each turn by a player and exploited for an advantage. But these non-player powers were generally weak (one got wiped out entirely on the second turn, I think) and didn't provide much more than a nuisance to whichever player they attacked. Similarly, the game starts with a number of spaces containing entrenched natives that should have provided opportunities for non-contiguous expansion. However, they had relatively weak defenses and, unlike player cities, were not supported by nearby troops. They, too, were dispatched with ease early in the game. 

I had fun playing, and I'd happily do so again. But the framework seemed a little too loose, and the combat a little too random, to suggest the potential for a long-term love affair. I'd guess there are probably better examples of the genre. My foray into true wargames is probably not a long-term thing for me, but it was a nice introduction to the genre (Sword of Rome is Risk-ish enough to not be completely foreign). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Rollicking multiplayer CDG that takes about 3 turns to learn or teach a group and afterwards is a lot of fun. The game establishes some clever tensions between the different groups, and the presence of the Neutral Powers allows interaction even when you are far from an opponent.

The Gauls, Greeks and Romans all have a unique schtick - plunder for the Gauls, citybuilding for the Romans, naval raids out of Sicily for the Greeks. The Samnite/Etruscans feel a little anodyne by comparison, but the overall balance seems decent.

Rules need (and have received) a quick buff up. This is fundamentally Hannibal with a multi-player mechanism. I found the time period (a decade a turn) out of whack with the move/combat system and the whole thing felt like too much had been added to the base model. I did enjoy the characterisation of the four player-blocks which was most entertaining. But its low score here is a function of time required to play more than anything.

RATING: 5
Perhaps I am just "done" with multiplayer wargames.  They all feel the same, they are about making deals and ganging up on people, and are often decided by bad luck, or someone being gang-tackled, or someone acting irrationally.  The rules ultimately become just chrome. In such a context, rules weight and long play time (especially if you don't get to finish) just become irritants.  Why go through all the work to learn/teach the game, and play for hours and hours, if the events of the game are going to be decided by some bad die rolls, or ganging-up on the leader, or picking on the weakest player for spoils?  Might as well play a shorter simpler game, and then nobody is stuck being a loser for 4+ hours.

I am tired of games that are about convincing Player A to attack Player B, while you try to get away with something.  SoR is that game, with a long play time and a lot of rules weight.  

It has a lot of historical flavor, which made me think maybe it was worth it, but in the end, it's still "don't attack me, attack him" yet again.  Just done with that.  Maybe a good game for those who still find that an interesting situation for 9 hours.  Personally, I am getting rid of all my multplayer wargames.  They always seem to disappoint.  I have come to prefer team wargames instead, with everybody on one of two sides, and no diplomacy or treachery or picking on the weak guy or ganging up on the leader.  Just more fun for everyone, and they play faster since everyone on a team moves simultaneously.

Probably the most taut 4-player wargame available, one where each player needs to keep the other three players in check.  "Gang up on the leader" is a necessity, but each player is vulnerable, and the key to winning is knowing how to hang back until you are ready to pounce.  Endgame play does make for some ahistorical maneuvers, but overall the mechanics are remarkable.

:coffee: :( :what: :what: :D :D OK, I can finally speak to this one with some degree of authority after a more or less full game (of the 6 turn variety). I was hoping for a game that would be an improvement on other multi-player card-driven wargames with regard to game length, which this kind of wasn't -- we worked out to an average of a turn an hour (incorporating a lunch break), so if you're looking at this as a viable Here I Stand/VQ/Nappy Wars alternative that can be played on a weeknight, you're in for a rude awakening, sorry to say. There's probably some room to push that time per turn down once we get the rules down pat but that will require experienced player.

That said, it's quite fun, and I say this even though I spent a majority of the game on the periphery of the board with a meager stock of VPs.

The four (five with the expansion) powers really feel different with a minimal degree of chrome in the rules -- the Gauls are your basic plundering pillaging barbarians for your I-pay-the-iron-price types, the Etruscans and Samnites (two separate nations controlled by the same player) have to protect their necks, seek opportunities and generally avoid getting crushed by the bigger powers that surround them, the Greeks get the rockstar generals but are basically a shark that has to keep swimming forward or, well, dead shark, the Carthaginians (only player-controlled in the five player game) are in an advantageous corner position but can't keep a large army in the field for an extensive period, and the Romans need to remind everyone that just because they won this game in real life, they're not a guaranteed colossus on the board -- lest they get gang-banged to within an inch of their lives by all and sundry. And you are sometimes frustrated in your attempts to redress the balance by the tyranny of geography, Italy being shaped the way it is.

The geopolitical balance is very finely tuned -- if the Greeks and Carthaginians don't keep each other in check, if the Etruscans get a free hand to whup on the Gauls with no repercussions on their southern border, if everyone leaves the Romans alone, etc., etc., you're liable to have created a monster. For that reason alone, the first game is quite likely to be sub-optimal. But I suspect that a dedicated band of masochists -- err, serious wargamers -- are going to have a treat on their hands if they take a few whacks at Sword of Rome.

The combat system is the source of many complaints. I didn't hate it. To further extend the run of [i]Game of Thrones[/i] references, it is definitely a "you win or you die" proposition. (Actually, sometimes it's a "you win and you die" proposition.) Combat is bloody, the dice can be whimsical, and troops are not easily replaced. It didn't seem unfair or unrealistic, though.

The rules are 95% straightforward and well presented and 5% maddening. It basically works, I just wish the designer and developer had had just a bit less loyalty to We The People and Hannibal and had maybe had the revelation that the political control markers were adding a lot of rules overhead for not a lot of good purpose, fer example.

Quibbles aside, I like this game, I want to play it again, quite a bit. I fear that I like this game for what it [i]almost[/i] is. But as of now, it gets a pretty enthused recommendation.

RATING: 7
I'm a big fan of the CDG genre generally, but Sword of Rome was my first exposure to a multiplayer CDG. I was expecting diplomacy and negotiation. I mean, there are formal alliances as part of the game. But for whatever reason, I was not prepared for the amount of metagaming and whining that comes with a diplomacy game like this. 

Its been a few years since I played a multiplayer wargame. I'd forgotten how people jockey to appear to be doing worse than they truly are. Maybe it was group dynamic, but Sword of Rome really seems conducive to that...and in that aspect at least I didn't care for it.

But in terms of gameplay and theme, its fantastic. There is a lot of great chrome. Its cool how each side can sculpt and manage its deck. There are some tough choices. 

But the most memorable thing from SoR is that the VPs are TIGHT. If you lose a VP city, you better get it back quick or you'll be out of the running. 

The basic mechanics of the game are very reminiscent of Hannibal. The map is beautiful and pragmatic. There is a low chit count, but they are colorful and easy to use. 

Immediately after the game, I didn't think we'd get it on the table again (it was about 8 hours...including lots of rules consultation and philosophizing), but a couple days later I found the whole group wanting to play and scheduling a 2nd time. I'd expect it to play much more quickly the 2nd time.

Nice game, it's heavvy on Hannibal, but borrows from NW.
Wild combact system and constrained spaces on map detract from the enjoyment. Separate sets of cards for each power and unique abilities are well done. After 8 plays I found that the game doesn't stand repeted play. Basically you are just waiting to get to turn 8-9 in the right position to grab victory. They should have done it 6 turns long. Beware that in the 6 turn version the roman player doesn't have a chance to win. After repeted play I can say that it takes too long for what it offers.

Only played once so far.   Suffers from lots of downtime, but doesn't enjoy the dynamics of Here I Stand.  I'm sure there's plenty of subtlety that I can't see yet.  I'd like to play again sometime with speedier turns to decide what I think about SoR.

It's not my most played wargame but if I was to name a favourite it's the one. If I had three other interested people to play with more often it would see the table far more. 

The setting of the game is interesting to me. There is no edge of the map where you can feel safe. The north can be invaded by other non-player Gauls and the south is locked in war with Carthage (which can also be a fifth player). Multiplayer means there is meta balancing going on. The rulebook was easy to read the first time. The board is pretty and not cluttered during play. Battles are random and sieges are safer which matches my impression of the period. The factions all play differently; the ravaging hordes of Gauls, the "two factions-one player" Samnite-Etruscans, the fortifying Romans and the well positioned Greeks who suffer from internal strife.

SOR is not a very engaging game. Although there is a lot of player interaction because of the cards, battles are small in scale and too random for my liking. The difficulties in replacing your lost armies ensures turn of inactvities which result in player losing interest. Yes, its suppose to be a political game but even that fails to live up to expectation. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
One play, but probably enough to convince me not to play it again.  A lot of downtime, with turns taking about an hour each.  Can't get too much into the history but the length of the turns combined with the variety of cards means it won't narrate very well.  

The biggest issue I see is there is a lot of disincentive to action.  Combat is extremely dangerous to the loser - the loss of support combined with combat unit loss can be overwhelming.

I might be convinced to play again but play length is a big negative too - I can't see this game taking less than 6 hours unless automatic victory occurs.

Four factions that all play differently and have their own card deck, a good amount of interaction, and the distinct possibility of come from behind victories. The only downsides are a long playtime (8 hours initially with Hannibal experience, hopefully down to 6 with a few games under the belt), and a few fussy rules (make a cheat sheet for what support/loyalty changes you can make in different situations!). Otherwise, this should be an award winner.

Good game... The dynamics and mechanics for the game played out well, which made for very interesting interactions between the players. The use of neutral powers was well executed within the game. Had a very enjoyable first game despite horrendous bad play on the Romans' part i.e. me...  The Romans should have started up shoring their home areas and playing on their strength at fortifications. Game ended with a Greek automatic victory with a good play by David in his attempts to get 2 extra VPs at the cost of the neutral Carthaginians.

Played a 3 player game, interesting feel as the Estruscans did not feel threatened unlike the 4 player game where they are sandwiched between the Gauls in the North and Romans in the South.

Cards are rather dull and not very thematic.
The global multilayer gameplay is limited in terms of options and depth, basically you fight with your immediate neighbours and ignore the rest of the map/game.
Dice luck factor is also (too) important.
Gallic gameplay is poor and with very limited interaction with the other players.
Overall rather weak game particularly if you have played Hannibal or Successors before.

Update 2/20/2010: First play, and what a blast! I had a great time, even though my Etruscan/Sammites got blown out (3 horrendous battle defeats for the Etruscans on essentially 1-1 attacks left the door open for the Gauls to stream south). Less chaotic than Successors, which I consider a good thing.

RATING: 8
Excellent card driven game on the early Roman Republic. The asymmetric sides keeps the game interesting, as each player has their own objectives and quirks. This game smartly uses custom decks for each player rather than a single monolithic deck, which generates a more coherent and flavorful narrative than some of the other CDG's.

The length of play is a bit on the long side for a CDG, at about 1 hour per turn for a 4p game, even longer for a 5p game but nothing too terrible. The long game is 9 turns, but I've never played anything but the short game at 6 turns, though in practice someone usually scores an auto-win by then anyway. Some early rules issues were later worked out, so if you have an older version be sure to get the living rules.

It's nice that the game supports up to 5p now, but I think I still prefer the 4p version.

Anyway, thumbs up.

I've played both hilariously fun and gruellingly clever games of this. It seems to suit different types of wargamers. The neutral activation mechanic is a clever addition to CDGs. There's lots of historical flavour in the cards and the different ways the factions are played (possibly too much of the latter to remember all the exceptions). The combat system is wild, but appropriate for the period. A good fun multiplayer wargame.

FANTASTIC! The only negative I have to say about the game is that the map isn't mounted. That flimsy thing they included was a bit of a disappointment, but so far the only one.

Update: After having played this several times I lowered the rating to an 8. The battles are simply too random and too deadly which makes any long term planning impossible. Still a good game though if you can live with the chaos.

Update 2: The combat system really kills this game for me. The game should really be rated much lower but the historical period is just so cool I keep it at 7.

I love GMT games and I love CDG games. I've even studied quite a bit of Roman history, so this should have been one of the games I would have liked best. Yet, no matter when I've played it, it reminds me of the old parody title of War at Sea--DICE at Sea. This should be called SLICE WITH THE DICE at ROME instead of Sword of Rome because it uses so many dice and brutally destroys the losers of the die rolls with extra damage. I know it's supposed to represent the many routs that took place because of morale, but hey! Give me a break somewhere!

RATING: 8
In fairness to the genre, I must state first that I'm not a big fan of card-driven wargames. The things I don't like about them: scripted gameplay, limited tactical choices, point to point movement, cards that frequently have silly or vaguely themed flavor text to justify a game mechanism, cards which are prerequisites to play other cards, cards that cancel other cards, and (finally and especially) the necessity to memorize a deck of cards in order to play the game competetively. Sure, all those things exist in Sword of Rome. But thanks to the interesting theme, fine components, carefully balanced sides, and finely crafed rules, I found the game well worthwhile anyway. 

The rules for placing support in particular were hard for me to wrap my head around. But eventually I got it. And I'm glad I persevered. The game is worth the effort.

In the end, I'm having a lot of fun playing this game, even with it's CDG trappings. It's been an interesting little history lesson as well. I find myself thinking about possible strategies even when I'm not playing the game, and that I think is the sign of a good game.

A quite straightforward CDG wargame. Knowing at least your own deck is essential since it will incluence your game (for example Greeks -> Karthage). 

Situation is quite static and so a full game is propably too much of a same thing, but shorter version works fine. Battle system is a bit weird and that can put some people off.

Update: After playing both 4- and 5- player game I feel that the 4-player game works better. With 5 players the game can become somewhat fragmented: Karthago vs Greek down south and the rest up north.

The historical flavor of the era is well captured, partly due to the individual player card decks.

A game with good potential but let down in its execution.

Enjoyable, and an OK game for a multiplayer wargame, but its predecessor, Hannibal, is more exciting and dynamic.  It's very difficult for any player to really get an advantage.  Two steps forward, two steps back in this one.

Nonetheless, my introduction to the card-driven genre with appreciation - the multi-use cards present an interesting challenge.

Well, I can't go wrong with the theme.   I like the individual decks, but I often felt like I was buffetted around by events, and I don't feel like I'll know what I'm doing until I've played several times.

The game is brutally unforgiving, especially the combat system (which I think is very interesting).

I feel like the cumulative VPs for holding a city can put players into an unwinnable position fairly early on, which isn't appealing for a game of this length, but again, that might be a first play kind of problem.

I like everything about this game except the combat system.  Actually, combat overall is simple and clean, but the results can be absurdly skewed.  Losing a battle you had overwhelming odds of winning is reasonable.  Being annihilated in that same battle to the point where you can't even compete in the game, as a result of one crazy roll of the dice, is not.  A deal-breaker for me.  And I know it's not just me -- others have voiced this concern on BGG.  The CRTs defenders typically cite the unpredictability and extreme outcomes of the real battles the game simulates, but destroying the playability of a game for the sake of supposed historical fidelity is, to me, a bad trade off.  Another argument is that one needs to plan for possible unlucky outcomes.  However, if an event has, say, a 1/50 chance of occurring, the player who acts conservatively in order to avoid such outcomes is merely playing to avoid being last, because the other players in the game quite rationally will NOT play conservatively (because the low odds of having to pay the price for it), and some will always get away with it.  

The CRT problems are a shame, because having unique decks for each power is a GREAT feature.  With a better CRT this game would unquestionably be a 9+ and in my top 10.  

Update: With a couple plays under my belt using the new CRT in the 2010 edition, I have raised my rating somewhat, but there is still possibly no other game that could be more improved by the use of averaging dice.

I strongly suggest only playing this game with version 1.3 of the rules, all the options and the 5th-player expansion. 

If you are using the 4-payer version I'd take 2 points off this rating as it is simply too long, random and slow moving. Just between us, whoever is involved the least will win. And that usually means the Greeks. 

But, overall, the 5-player game is different. Surprisingly, it feels faster, probably because there are more cards involved and more players on the attack in any one turn. I guess it's just more difficult to hang back and pick off the wounded with a 5th player. Unfortunately, battles are almost as chaotic as in the original, so who wins one is more luck based then I'd like. And as reinforcements never seem to make good losses, everyone gets weaker as play progresses.

But the only remaining hole in the rules I know of concerns who controls the non-playing neutrals. As things now stand, they can't be controlled by their natural enemy or its allies, but then again there are allies and then there are allies. An "un-official ally" or someone who is looking to earn some brownie points can make a neutral do some very stupid things.

All in all though, I'd say the 5-player version produces a long, fun, though somewhat choatic, game well-worth playing.

RATING: 2
SoR is a 6-8 hour "take that" card game with an added layer of complexity that makes it seem like it might be a really cool war game.  It's not.

As with all card driven games, the unit density is low and therefore the game play can be fragile - with a bad die roll or a bad hand of the cards on a turn when a player is particularly vulnerable effectively ending the game for that player.  My experience with card-driven war games is that about every 3rd play of a game is actually a really good contest and the other two are blow-outs due to the fragility issue described above.  Therefore one of the keys to enjoying these games is to know when to resign and start over.  The CDG-fragility issue is even worse than usual because of the combat system which can have huge, wild swings in outcomes and is unadjusted for force size.  In my last game, I had a small but substantial force (3 combat units) wiped out while conducting a siege.  This wasn't even a battle - I was just sitting there at a city and had a bad attrition roll.

The biggest problem with SoR is that it is a multi-player game and therefore resigning is not an option, so if you get beaten down you are facing loooong hours of play doing very little save rebuilding your forces or watching your empire crumble.

Another problem is that if one player gets beaten down it actually pays for the other players to continue to beat on him because the way the game is won is by taking over territory.  This can benefit the beaten down player's immediate neighbors unfairly.

Man, this game sucks.  Multi player card driven games don't work.

Very good asymmetric multiplayer wargame.

It would rate higher if the game was a bit shorter.  As good as the game is, there isn't much variability from turn to turn.  Playing one of the shorter scenarios hits the sweet spot for me.

RATING: 9
Definitely fun. I like the different decks for each player power so that each plays differently. A con is that you need four people willing to invest time into learning a fairly complicated game.  Like most good games, it's well worth the investment but many people, unfortunatly, don't want to invest that kind of effort.  The combat resolution is a wild, open affair. I don't mind the system but some players who like more control will complain.

Somewhat your standard GMT chit wargame, but a well done one.  Interesting individual faction powers and strategies, though not all factions seem to be created equal (Etruscans/Samnites were disappointing to play).  A+ for theme, right down to the explanations of the historical events in the rulebook.  Combat can be swingy.

Sword of Rome in the end is just too random, and the combat system is definitely kooky.  The penalty for rolling poorly is so great, that even when you have a well-planned attack in your favor, you can lose it all.  And the combat losses don't reflect the fact that you had a nice attack planned out, since they are not modified the way the attack roll is.  So in the end, the person who rolls the best ends up winning?  While the combat system may accurately reflect the combat of the time, it does not make for a good game.

Played once with 5 player expansion. It had the feeling of everyone running around trying to prevent other people from winning. I think our game was unique as I, the Greek player, allied with the Carthaginians on turn one. I think if players do not exploit the alliance system, the game would be quite dull and involve going back and forth on control of a city here and there. I like the various decks and the substantial asymmetry between powers. The neutral powers are also handled quite well.

Here I stand is significantly better, however lacking 6 players, i think SoR is an enjoyable alternative. Here I stand's negotiation mechanism really sets it apart from other multiplayer CDGs. I would like to play SoR again using one of the other powers.

I like the subject, but I fear the game may not survive a mandatory purge of the collection. I dislike the political consequences mechanic and wish the Etruscans and Samnites could each be its own power. They're strange; in recent playings they have not won; but have come in second. They need to be a pair of silver-tongued used chariot salesmen to succeed. Anyway, my gaming group enjoys Sword of Rome so it gets trotted out every now and then.

Rating after one 4-player game that lasted about 4hrs. I played the Etruscan/Samnites. Well I finished with exact the number of VPs I started with. No loss but no win either. So what did I do during 4 hrs of play, I ask myself. The Rome player won, but he knew the game already and therefore also some useful strategies. Due to the historical flavor each faction has some special traits, sometimes advantages but also restrictions. So it's clearly an asymmetrical gameplay. As there is card drafting and dice rolling during combat/sieges there is also a significant luck factor in this game which can be frustrating. This seems also to be the reason I finished with the same VPs: when I lost a city I was able to get it back but no more as there are only very few reinforcements.

Loathed by some of my mates but I enjoyed my single game of it, and wold like to play some more. It is a tight strategic situation and I can see why it frustrates some people, but I can also see the value behind it I expect it rewards repeat play with all the powers. I don't think it would ever overtake Successors for me as a 4 player ancients CDG, but I'd love to get some more plays in.

RATING: 8
It is a very good multiplayer game that is asymmetrical but extremely well balanced.  It covers a period of history that is very unknown and hardly ever covered in gaming.  The play dynamics are solid and interesting, but ultimately cannot stand up to PBEM as there is too much down time as well as too many opportunities for interruption of the normal sequence of play.  It's very interactive and keeps players generally engaged when it isn't their turn.

Very fun and hope to be able to play again soon.

Where to begin?
SoR tries to be 4-player Hannibal, and overall it is very clean for a multi-player CDG with asymmetric powers. So, I guess, kudos for that.
But man, what a train-wreck. The atrocious CRT has been commented on elsewhere, and I assure you it is as bad as rumored. Having a total of 12 CUs on the board means losing 7+ on a freak result puts you out of the game for hours. The game is balanced on a knife-edge, so if people don't play their roles (and activate the neutral powers just right) the game can degenerate.
Allow me to stress that all of these problems result in one or more of the players having nothing interesting or fun to do--and problems that suck the enjoyment out of the game for some are worse than problems just in general.
Finally, Successors is so much better on every level. It's really quite ridiculous.

RATING: 7
Another CDG on a fascinating subject, but with a strangely unhistorical feel. Simply put: the periods the turns claim to depict (decades) makes no sense whatsoever with the actual gameplay - it would take at least thirty years to move an army from one end of the peninsula to the other. Similarly with named leaders, who stay around for decades (nice chrome of "electing" the Roman consuls: but the consuls weren't elected for twelve-year commands).
The movement and recruiting of armies pays no attention to the seasonality of ancient warfare, long before the kind of protracted service which kind of makes sense for Hannibal - what does attrition really mean happening once in a twelve-year turn? I understand that abstractions have to be made for gameplay, but the resulting mismatch feels odd. Basically, the turns would make total sense if they represented a year each: but that makes the history not work.
The event cards are nice, though, mixing historical events with more generic stuff in a reasonable way (although, understandably given the sources, mostly from a Roman perspective).

PbeM suitability: not very good, as many of the cards are interrupts (for raids, sieges etc) which is awkward with a multiplayer wargame. There's also the possibility of playing Desperate Times as a sort of interrupt, too: it requires waiting before taking one's turn to allow for other players jumping in.

I'm growing less enthusiastic about the mismatch between the movement/evasion/intercept/siege mechanics (ported with some modification from HANNIBAL) and the turn scale.

The best game of 2004. Great components,  very balanced and excellent card-driven mechanic and point to point system. The best of all of the card driven games (along with Napoleonic Wars). Worse "the randomness in the combat", but that with the rules revision is solved (view SoR - Living Rules v1.2.pdf).

I found SoR very accesible, more so than another iteration, Successors.  I enjoyed the power specific card decks, and found the game play fairly quick... there seemed less down time to me than in some other multiplayer wargames I've tried.  I know that the combat system can be a bit random and unforgiving, but that doesn't bother me, you have to come to grips with that before you start.  The 'alliance' mechanic seemed very important, and I probably overlooked it a bit on my first play.  All in all I thought this was a pretty solid multiplayer wargame with just enough theme to keep me interested in coming back for another go...

Initial Rating: 4.5 (May 2015)

I’m not a wargamer. I was tricked into playing Sword of Rome, I thought we were going to play Battlestar Galactica :P. 

For me, it is a regular game, it last a long time and the decisions aren’t that hard (more or less you have to choose who to attack and/or what to defend). I confess I have some fun playing it, but I won’t ever request it and I won’t lose sleep if I never play it again. 

I like that each player has different powers (asymmetrical).

Sword of Rome has lots of luck, you have to roll for everything (to attack, to defend, to siege, to sail, for attrition) and the luck of the draw can also be high. I dislike that I feel it is luck who decides who win (because the decisions are obvious really), and this is even worse when the game duration can be over the 6 hour mark. In our game if a player rolled 6 or more in a siege he would have won, but he rolled a 4 so he lost. I found the sieges to be overly slow and luck driven as it didn’t matter how many army tokens you have (but to make a siege you need at least 3), so many times you begin a siege and then be repelled losing part of your army and hours of your life.

These days, I (almost) never enjoy games in which all players attack the perceived leader and are ripe for backstabbing situations. Sword of Rome share both of these traits BUT I liked that you can make an alliance and if you want to attack your ally you have to pay a penalty. Still you know that you are going to be betrayed at some point, so the best strategy (as usual) is to never be the leader (lay low), but be close to him in VPs, then at very end make your big move, usually backstabbing the power who helped you during the game.

I realize the cards are a very good design, you have to choose if you play the strength of the card or the event of the card and it is a(somewhat) hard decision and the only one interesting in all the game, but in general I was a bit bored with them.

I strongly believe Sword of Rome is a 4 player game, with more, a couple of hours are added to the playtime and it increases the downtime, both very negative in my book.
 
The paper board is awful, but we played with the mounted board of the deluxe edition (which is very nice). I also (in general) dislike the small chits of many wargames, mainly because they have lots of information in a very small font, but I didn’t have that problem with this game, the chits have almost no information.

The theme is ok (but I couldn’t care less for it), and the cards capture it very well.

I feel the game has in its majority easy decisions, the complexity comes from the minutiae of the rules (they are easy, but many) and the long playtime so I would catalogue it as a Medium-Heavy weight game, however I feel the decisions are much harder and interesting in Agricola, Madeira or Tragedy Looper to name a few.

Bottom line, I will do my best to stay away from the game, sadly all the other players loved it and they already asked me if I would play again with them (5 player game). I have a rule and it is I will play anything twice, so I guess I will play it again.

RATING: 8
Handles 2 to 4 players as follows: for 2 players, each player handles two powers -- only suitable for learning the game. For 3 players, the Gauls (the player to the North) are handled by a random event table, that proved to be fairly representative of the threat a Gaul player would hold in a 4-player game.  Since the Gauls are unusual in that they don't get VPs by holding territory (they plunder to accumulate VPs) and since they're the only player unable to hold cards over between turns (they were very unorganized ) they're the easiest power to "replace". Four players is ideal, as this will create a fluid game of varying alliances and leaders. 

This could be considered a seven "player" game in that there are three other powers that are activated by the players in order to harass each other's flanks. The four decks are unique enough to add specific flavor to each power, with events loosely based on history.  High replay value with this game. PBeM using ACTS is enjoyable if playing with responsive people, allowing time for more diplomacy and coordinated planning. 

   The rules are straightforward and weren't any trouble for those of us who've never played H:RvC (or CDGs for that matter).  After a little experience we were finishing a FTF turn every 30-45 minutes.  Strengths: highly interactive; highly variable strategies and outcomes; a wild combat system that isn't for those who require deterministic results.  Weaknesses: too loosely represents history for a game requiring this much playtime; very hard to find three other gamers willing to commit to playing it (too complex for many German-style players, too light for many wargamers), and unless you are using the unknown game end variant it can have too much end-of-the-world game behavior.

RATING: 6
(Rating based on one play)

I bought this as a 5-player replacement of Here I Stand. After one play I consider this a take-it-or-leave-it game. Each side plays slightly differently and has some special rules that make it different from other sides of the conflict. Yet the rules are simple. I don't feel Sword of Rome has any flaws, but there's also nothing special about it. For a game of this length I would certainly expect more depth and more ways of achieving victory. The struggle between the players is only military and I feel that adding some politics into the game would make it more interesting. I like the idea of each player having separate deck and that none of the events on the cards is random. Also, the events are very climatic, depicting many historical events, which is a huge plus.

So, as a 5-player game I don't think there are many competitors (Shogun is the only one that comes to my mind). But with 4 players I think I'd go with Successors.

This is not a bad game but its not a good game either. The biggest problem is the battle. The outcome of a battle can and most likely will be catastrophic. It is nearly impossible to build up a new army, since the ops cards range is from 1-3 and you need a 3 card to build one CU. Also the game does get a little boring at a time since you do not have many options during your turn. Basically you either build new CU, raise your city status or move your armies. Also the game can be a bit longish. So if you loose most of your armies on the first turn then basically you should be out of the competition. Overall the game has a lot of issues but it can be fun if played with the right set of mind. So if I had to recommend a good multyplayer CDG, it wouldn't be Sword of Rome.

Much less complicated than originally expected, actually decent little game and can be played in an afternoon. Feels more like four separate two player games going on (except the Samnite/Etruscan player, perhaps) unless you get much better with strategy.

Fine game, only gets the low-ish rating because I'd don't think I'd personally be inclined to play it often.

This game takes us back to the early Roman period.  With accumulated expereince on card-driven games that GMT so engaged in for the past few years, this Roman vs. the surrounding enemies recreation surely got our next attention.  The actual box cover does let me down.  It is coarse, it is rough.  Well, maybe that's exactly the war it was.  The single map to use is really neat and nice, covering the whole of Italy and some surrounding areas.  The card decks are nicely done too, with each faction a single deck.  I would have hoped more graphics could be inserted (like that of the 30 Years War).  But I guess there is a lack of general graphical resources.  The game system is quite innovative in dealing with some of the typical issues in the ancient times: geopolitical strategies (i.e. alliances, political control markers), leaders' abilities (i.e. initiative and tactics ratings), static and interactive combat (siege warfare vs. interception and avoiding battles), as well as the use of navy and plunder.  Special rules are minimal, unlike "Rise of Roman Republic".  What's more, there is an informative play book for players to read about the designer and developer notes.  These notes tell you what are some of the choices that they made during the design of this game.  Examples of play and scenarios are included in this play book,     explaining some of the very nice gaming concepts and why in relation to historical accounts.  The 2-turn example of play by the four playtesters are very detailed and offers many insights into the gameplay and initial strategy.  Overall, an excellent historical wargame for 4-players sitting together for an afternoon enjoyment.

I'm a sucker for a CDG and for ancient theme, so this was a must play.  I found on first try that it seems to reward turtling a bit too much.  Length of play time is a problem, it could be shorter by about half.  The victory point system seems both static on the one hand, and potential for runaway leader problem on the other.  Taking a point away from someone else gives you a vp.  Only a point or two can make a huge difference, so it's easy to get ahead and stay ahead.  Overall, I enjoyed the play despite the mechanical issues.

RATING: 7.1
Not bad! A pretty light wargame focusing on the Italian Peninsula in ancient times. Rome tries to exert its rising dominance and meets resistance from the surrounding cultures who of course have their own problems amongst each other. Barbarians from the north are also doing their best to come down and take whatever isn't nailed down and drag it back. 

All this leads to a game where the different powers have distinct feels and strategies. A good quality title.

Nice game about the years of the born of Rome. A game that needs fast play more than others, it's very good in his three player option. Luck is important as battles can be a bloodbath as a skirmish (a thing I like, indeed), so don't pretend to win with only good play. Nice mechanics, each nation with a specific deck of cards; somewhat limited mapsheet, limited replay, a little too long.

Played 3 times. This is a great game for a few hours, but I really dislike the end-game. Too much kingmaking/attack the leader. Also, combat is too unpredictable for my taste, as all the games I've played have featured at least one player who essentially lost because he rolled poorly. Still, it's an entertaining, reasonbly-short multiplayer game that I often will agree to if that's what everyone else is playing.

Game moves along too quickly, considering the large time period it covers. Also, you would think a game of this scale would afford some opportunities to formulate long-term plans. By the time it's your turn again, you have to reformulate all your plans.  Maybe that's how the designer intended it to be, and I'm missing the point.  But I think it plays more like a tactical game, forcing you to constantly react to changing situations and never planning out any further than the immediate player turn.

This is a very tough strategy game where you really struggle to outpace your opponents.  It is a low-density counter game.  Note that it is quite a long game - you have to set at least 4-5 hours to play.  It works best over two nights so that you can work on the personal alliances.  The cards are very, very cool.  I have played it 5 times now and thoroughly enjoy it.  Highly recommended!

He jugado poco, pero me parece de los mejores Card Driven de más de dos jugadores que he jugado. El hecho que cada facción tenga su mazo de cartas minimiza el efecto suerte que se puede tener en juegos como Here I Stand o Virgin Queen, en los que robando de un mazo común, puedes tener partidas (de 8 horazas!!!) en las que te quedes vendido. Por contra, en Sword of Rome, si tienes dos turnos malos, que se preparen los demás, en el tercer turno lo vas a petar seguro!

Played 2-player, and while not the most balanced way to play, can still see the quality and potential of the game.  In this version, a bit weighted towards Rome/Etruscans, I think, but still great fun.  Wild shifts of fate with the combat rolls, but makes good stories.  I lost in turn 4, but both the Etruscans and Greeks reduced to zero victory points!  Fun to play the Gauls!

Not nearly as good as Successors, the other ancients multi-player CDG.  

Combat system is too variable/dicey (3d6 plus modifiers)... a bad combat roll can take a player out for hours.  I should know, it happened to me in my one and only playing of this game, as the Romans in a 3:1 attack, with the odds in my favour.  Roll badly, and it is essentially game over.

Game also feels strait-jacketed with limited strategic options.  Average wargame at best, could have been a much better game with better development.

Takes about two evening sessions (6 hrs) to complete.  Not worth the time imo.

Fantastic game.... nice blend of quick decisions, but having a sense of long tern strategic goals.  Player interaction is great, with neutral power activate cards you can make a bad day for a player who seems to be edging towards victory.  Have throughly enjoyed every game played.  Greeks may be slightly favored in four player game.  Etruscans have their hands full.  Rome must be watched.  I believe Gauls are are usually in the mix for the win.  Etruscan/Samanites have their work cut out for them...  Just got the 5th player add, can't wait to try it out!

My favourite card driven game.
Forget about seriuos and strategic wargames: SoR is a well done mixture of fun and luck (but not only). Many cards allow you to cast "bad things" on your fellow players :-) ...and other players will use their cards to annoy you.
Best with the 5-players expansion

Odds:
it takes long to finish a game (4  hours) and the roman player is a bit disadvantaged (like Lannister in Game of Thrones).

Just a superb CDG. Because of the way the game works each of the factions plays very differently. It really requires players to adjust from game to game. Makes for very good replay value.

UPDATE 2: Just played another game over VASSAL, and I may have been too harsh with my original assessment. The CRT has been fixed. SoR is NOT an empire-building game, it is a hack & slash wargame, with plentiful risks and rewards. Of course, if the dice are against you, or you get hammered by your opponents, that's not going top be very fun. But I'm much more open to playing than I was before.

UPDATE:  There are so many issues with this game that I'm just shocked it has the high rating it does.  Considering the time investment, the CRT, the Event cards, the power positions, I'm really finding I don't have time to hobble myself with all of it.  I adore the subject matter and time period, but the design is too murky to work through.  Depressing.

Playing this via VASSAL and thematically it's right up my alley.  Unfortunately, I am playing PoG over VASSAL as well and the latter is just simply outshining SoR.  As the E/S, I am simply trying to contain the rampaging Gauls.  I don't have a sense of how to increase my VP total, and as the Samnites I'm not going to go picking fights yet with the Romans when the Greeks are near and powerful.  Most of my events don't help my situation, so I just use most of them for ops and reinforcements, as opposed to PoG, where almost every Event has an easy application and the gameplay is nail-bitingly tense.I'm still in mid-game, so we'll see.  But I can see what some of the critics were saying, especially about the combat system.

Based on a single playing.  I sort of liked this game but have my doubts about the play balance, and too much of the game is taken up with the rather tedious process of building up and degrading control of cities.  In all, it is a bit boring.  A significant problem with it is the length.  It is not sufficiently fun for me to justify spending eight hours with four players on the rare occasions that this is possible - there are many more enjoyable games out there.  As usual for GMT, the rules are crap and the production values are crap for the money.

Comments based on one four player game only. John's Oetting's and Sumo's comments are bang on. Strange mismatch between turn scale (a decade per turn) and level of detail - especially in seiges which can last too long in game time. Poor attrition rules independent of force size. Main problem though is the total randomness of the combat rules - lucky/unlucky dice throws overwhelm bonuses from good planning/card play. This may be historically accurate but results in too random a game for what must be a 5/6 hour game even when experienced. Our first run through took 9 hours over two evenings before an automatic Etruscan/Samnite victory in turn 8. Became very chaotic and ahistorical towards the end game with despairing and rather silly efforts to "get lucky" and stop the leader - the board ending almost totally depopulated of troops. Too long for the payback and significantly inferior to Hannibal. Would be a good fun game four player game if you reduced the complexity/fiddly-ness and halved the play time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like this game quite a bit if played in right mood and not taken too seriously (the combat system has such a wide range of outcomes that any anger about a specific battle simply is not worth it). But I am of the opinion that the Greek side is too weak, so weak that whole turns pass husbanding its resources, while the others are battleing. This gets better in the 5 player game where Carthage is an active player power. I also think that the 2 player game could be quite good, but only with a few house rules.

Support rules should have been more streamlined but overall SOR is smooth.   Battles are risky and players must deliberate over whether to attack, retreat or stand and fight.  Turn angst: many options on your turn, but you can't do everything.

... downtime is signficant with newbies because there are so many choices ...  game is much better once everyone has some experience.  Playing with three players for the first time might be better, just because SOR would flow faster - but the four player game is otherwise superior.

Not exactly a historically accurate war game, but a neat simualtion of the period and the major powers present.  Components are nice and the rules are short and pretty clear.  play moves fairly quickly and the cards abviously add tension and variety to play.  I'm still out on playbalance from the aspect of (based off 4 games I've played) one power seems to be always on the verge of elimination from the start if you don't get to quickly forming alliances.  I'm also not convinced this works well with less than 4 players.  Reardless will continue to play since it's got great 'pickup game' value, plays fast, and maintains a high level of replayability.

An epic game of savage battles.  This game is not for the faint of heart, it's all about attacking over and over.  The combat system is chaotic.  This may be appropriate for the period, but can be extremely frustrating (I've never seen a game where you can be more hosed by dice rolls).  All in all I feel the game is too long for what it offers.  There's plenty of historical flavor and interesting strategy, but also plenty of chaos and the constant battles can become a bit monotonous.

I finally got a chance to play this game and was quite happy with the results. The designer sat in with me and my friends which helped rules comprehension a great deal. The game was a little longer than I thought it would play out, but with more experienced players (three of us having little to no experience with the game) that's probably less of an issue. I really liked the combat system as it seems to favor sheer force over everything else, with plenty of chances for an upset. We had several in game where two units took out 5 units. Multi-player Card Driven Game. What's not to like?

Another good addition to the Card Driven Genre. A real benefit since it is a 4 (or 5 with Carthage) game. I really like how the different powers play differently since they all have their strengths and weaknesses. 
Didn't particular care way battles were resolved.

The revisions that tone down the casualties and using the optional rules to conserve forces look to be useful

I've rated other CDGs higher, but Sword of Rome is my sentimental favourite, not least because of the wonderful, rare period of history covered. Don't let the box cover and name mislead you: this is a history of Italy itself, when Rome was only one of many cultures vying for dominance on the peninsula, and fortunes could have gone any way. Finally, we have a game where Rome's illustrious but mysterious neighbours, such as the Etruscans, get their fair share of attention.

The designer has made no secret of taking his cue from Hannibal, also incorporating in elements from some of the more recent GMT games. The result is a thoroughly satisfying and rich game, fairly fluid, quick-paced, and streamlined for a wargame, with a violent and engaging dice-rolling combat mechanism in which the dice rolled to determine hits are also used to determine casualties taken.

Those who complain about the chaotic nature of the game, or the ability of outnumbered forces to make a surprise win in a fight, simply don't get the period at all. Small forces could and did turn the tables on much larger aggressors, and combat (and life in general) was chaotic and undependable. Revel in the spirit of the theme!

While the game is not perfect (none of them are), I will happily suggest playing it and/or play it if suggested at the drop of a hat.

Wray has done an amazing job of infusing history while distilling rules. I commend Wray/Brad/Volko on an outstanding and enjoyable multi-player CDG.

In my opinion SoR is superior to The Napoleonic Wars, and is certainly more accessable.

My disclaimer is I have only played it 4-player.

Interesting CDG strategy game but has a high luck driven combat and siege resolution system which deducts points from the game.  You are abit too dependent on the cards you draw as well. As Rome won in the real world, there is a tendency in the game to gang up against any player that takes it.

Based on two plays with 4 players, finished neither.  Each power has a different feel, with different strengths and weaknesses.  The hand size allows you to play plenty of events (the flavor of the game) in addition to Operations and Support (takin' care of business).  The rules are well written and almost errata-free.  On the down side, in both of my games Rome was beaten down so much it would not have come back.  Possibly more balanced with experienced players who know all the cards.  Rather long with inexperienced players.

Nicely balanced four player game (not so good with two or three) Pits the nascent military juggernaut of emerging Rome against the waning might of Greece, the troublesome Etruscan-Samnites and the raiding  Gauls.

The players command decks force  choices between events and operations points. The cards also allow players to awaken neutral powers such as the Trans Alpine Gauls and Carthaginians to keep opponents from assuming a secure rear.

The expansion game now allows for a 5th player to take over Carthage, Rome's ancient nemesis.

RATING: 7.5
I enjoyed my first play of this and was engaged through to the end.  We took 6 turns, with myself as Etruscans/Sammite reaching 12 but Romans reaching 13.  It's my favorite CDG I've played so far, but it still is very long for the amount of decisions you make.  And it is possible for a player to be eliminated or near-eliminated (I was able to smash the Gauls down with the help of Transalpine, so that he had no CU and only got 2 reinforcements) - his score was 0 by end of turn 4, so he had little point in playing more.  I'd much prefer to play Britannia if I have the time to play a long 4-player war game with an ancient/Dark Ages historical theme.

RATING: 7.7
--Jul2008-- Rating is provisional; it's the result of a single not particularly elegant play:  and I'm afraid that I played particularly badly.  Yet the game is fascinating, colorful, and subtle.  The powers aren't carbon copies one of another; each has their own strengths and natural agenda.  I'd love to play it a couple more times - soon - to get a better feel for the system.  Though if after those plays I rank the game an 8 or never want to touch it again is still very much up in the air.
...
Several more plays later, it's apparent that the rules are much better/tighter/more sensible than the mistaken version of our first outing.  I'm still terrible, but the game system is excellent.

Didn't look sexy enough in the original P500 description, but now that I've seen it in action, it's moved up my list.  I like the fact that this is a step back in complexity from the PoG, FtP, BtB monsters.  I also like the mini-deck and special abilities for each power.  The only grey lining on this silver cloud is the (cough) highly-variable combat system.  However, with the right mindset (yaaarrgggh!!) even this is easily forgiven. [Cue the circus music.]

Good fun, if long, multiplayer game that centers on the Roman conquest of Italy. Players take on players of the period: Greeks, Romans, Gauls, Etruscans/Samnites...and each race has different ways of winning. Rome needs to fortify and build new walled cities, the Gauls need to plunder etc.

Not sure about the balance as some players seem to have it harder. Also not to keen on the 'self balancing' bash the leader syndrome that appears. No amount of diplomacy will stop that if you're in the lead...Still, a good fun way to pass 5 hours.

A multiplayer CDG in the roman era. The designer have taken a lot of what made Hannibal so good and added some new stuff to make an excellent game. Every nation has its own deck of cards which gives every nation a different feel. The only gripe I have with the game is that it suffers from the "attack the leader"-syndrome. It is far too easy to gang up on the leader and drag him down which makes for a long game. Personally I also dislike that the map is unmounted. But these are minor issues. Sword of rome is a good game. Recommended!

Picked up due to Calandale's preference and, boy, is he right on this one! In its simplicity, with respect to, say, Here I stand, it renders very effectively the more rudimental nature of ancient world power struggles, and really hits a sweet spot between richness and playability. Very good solo, even with 5 sides.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Draws inspiration from Hannibal which it extends to a multiplayer setting during the early Roman unification of Italy. Two brilliant innovations for CDGs: (1) Individual player decks make events relevant to each faction, and (2) extra cards compared to number of rounds per turn makes playing responses worthwhile and reduces downtime due to some players accumulating extra cards. Really enjoyed the fluid situation which doesn't feel scripted along historical lines but still retains a great deal of flavour with distinct factions.  The combat system can feel harsh, but battles resolve quickly and feels very appropriate to the era. Overall, I much prefer to The Napoleonic Wars and even Here I Stand.

Main negatives: it's LONG. Been averaging about 1 hour / turn and with the "short" version that's roughly 6 hours / game. Takes several sessions to get the rules down correctly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's ok.  Fun enough, but it suffers from many of the problems that arise from multiplayer wargames -- "self-balancing" by forcing attacks against the perceived leader, people caught in the middle of the pinch of expansion, negotiations on how people are in fact not leading, powerful players unable to reach and stop leaders to bloody their nose because of large swaths of terrain or weak players in the middle.  

Still, many fun choices are available, and the cards are great, but the battles are extreme, and a run of bad luck can have you out of the VP race yet still playing on.  I will say that despite the fact that there is little strategy in the Gauls, they may be the most fun.  Get your cards, see what you can do, run around and ransack.  No careful deliberation of trying to take what you can, protect everything and reclaim all you've lost over and over again. 

There is a ton of color in the game, and it mostly works, it is just too brittle for my tastes.

RATING: 7.5
I played once. I played the wild Tribal guys in the north. Smashed the Etruscans right from the start until a card held by the Greeks started a group of guys coming in on my overextended rear. Very inconvenient. I had to leave halfway thru the game so I attacked Rome. Somehow he managed to kill almost all my guys with little loss to him without using any defenses. Seemed interesting, the combat resolve method but need more chance to look at it.

Okay, we were missing the fourth player so had a robot Gaul, but the main problem was it it is a level of complexity higher than it needs, and basically the situation didn't appeal to anyone. We almost got into a three way row about the movement rules. The rules open by clearly stating that the hill tribes must be subjugated. After a while, and a drubbing from the Volsci, the Roman player started to whinge, with some justification. It turned out that the movement rules are far from clear until you read the play book - you can of course nip around hill tribes and walled cities unless they are manned. Meanwhile the Etruscan was being picked off by random Gallic NPC attacks, and the Greeks (me) had their hands full with the Carthaginians. After three turns not one of us had scored a VP. I then got the sharp end of the regressive attrition rules and lost 2/3rd of a small sieging force (while a 10 stack could only lose 20% max - correct?). Didn't feel very historical either. Painful, but the combat rules were neat.

I'm undecided on this game. I like the theme. I hate the "screw you" cards the Etruscians and Samnites have. I'm also wary of the combat. I can't think of the word for it, but an example would be that I roll three 3s for a 9 plus my leader is better by 1 so I get a 10 total, while my opponent rolls two 4s and a 1 for a 9 and loses, but I deal zero damage and he kills two of my CU.  Seems odd that I could win the battle, but inflict zero casualties...

Rating after one game.

Too abstract - no historical feel whatsoever, combat is way too deadly and random, plays too slowly. The only good thing about it is that it is a multiplayer game. Hanging with friends is always fun. But then again, why not play a good game while doing that.

It will probably appeal to fans of Pax Romana.

I already see a problem from a historical point of view : Rome is clearly overpowered in the setup compared to history (half the cities they have in the game were independant at the time, especially Capua but also others) 

I also confirm that, in the 5 player game, an alliance between Greeks and Carthage makes the game unbalanced. The 4 player game has also flaws as Carthage is used erratically.

Rather not convinced at this point

Presented as a "multiplayer Hannibal", this game lacks the elegance of the original. New holes in the rules are discovered during each play.

This is a good choice if BOTH of the following apply to your group: (1) You have exactly 4 people in your group. (2) At least some people in your group have experience with wargames, prerably card-driven wargames (CDGs). If you're new to CDGs or only have 2 in your group, I'd suggest We The People. If you have 5 in your group, I'd suggest Napoleonic Wars. If you have 6 in your group, I'd suggest Here I Stand.

One of the best multiplayer card driven wargames, along with [gameid=17392].  This game gets around the problem of most of your cards being used only for OPs by separating out the decks into individual powers, so every card you get has an event that benefits you.  It makes the decision of whether to use a card for OPs or the event that much more difficult.  The variable players help a lot too.  Each player feels different.  The history is implemented well, with each power pushed to meet their historical goals.  The interplay between powers is subtle, and seems to be well-balanced for a three-, four- or five-player session, a rarity in a CDG.

OK So I've changed my opinion of this game as I have now played quite a few games of it. It is my favorite multi player game because each faction has it's own special features and nuances.

(OK so its more fun crushing)

This game was only the 2nd CDG that I have played, and the first muli-player CDG.  I played it 3 times, 4 player games each time, before I decided to buy the "delux" reprint version.  Game play is not "heavy." One won't get serious headaches playing this game. In fact, it's kind of light hearted entertainment as a few players try to trash other cultures and expand the size of their own empires at the expense of others.  It's a game that I will continue to be willing to play whenever there's a group of 4 or 5 that is willing to play for about 5 to 6 hours.

I love this game, despite only a few (unrecorded) plays--but it's complexity and playing time make it almost impossible to get to the table.

Love this game.  5th player adds balance.  Love to crash down as the Gauls and raid, raid, raid.

I really like this game. I feel I need to play it more though... the card-driven mechanic and point to point system I find to be a nice mid-ground between "euro" and  traditional "hex and counter" type games.

Great multiplayer experience due to divergent victory paths - each faction feels unique. The alliance system also works well (inbuilt treachery option). In the end, it's not just the overall design but those little things like marauding Gauls and greedy Greek generals that make this a very endearing game. Harsh on risky players like myself, as numbers of combat units build up only slowly but can be wiped out rather quickly.

Love the asymmetry, but wow, that's some swingy combat you have there.  Like 'Here I Stand', best played for the historical experience than as a balanced, satisfying game.

Excellent game on Rome's rise to power and dominance on the Italian peninsula. Best played Multi-player but there is a two player scenario. Each 'power' is played very differently and each has their own set of unique victory conditions. This is one of my favourite strategic Ancients games.

When is a 4 hour game not a 4 hour game? When it is SoR. There are always tense decisions to make and no time at all to relax. I would enjoy playing this weekly or monthly.

This game has got me hooked! I can't stop thinking about the ways to make alliances, arrange card play, and just plain make my opponents lives miserable! Superb....Although after a few plays a "gang up on the leader" theme is starting to evolve. I hope the game doesn't slide into "king-maker" mode. A few more plays will help determine the above.

Bravo for design, game mechanics and replayability; a 4-player Hannibal and much more, highly recommended.

Ok, Samnites and etruscans are early out of the game. But for me this is the best multi-player card driven ever (with Here I stand). Alliance are important like in diplomacy, cards are faithful like Path of Glory, battles have very original results.

Very good multi-player CDG.  I like the diplomacy and the very different card decks.  Complexity is about right level.  Getting points for victory point locations each turn is different, but works.  Lots of interactions between players and the non-player powers makes it even more interesting.  My rating is for the 4-player game.  

I personally do not think this game works as well as a 5-player game.  In the normal 4-player game, the other 3 players can activate Carthage and provide a check on Greece.  The 5-player version works OK as long as Greece and Carthage fight each other, but if they decide to ally then the game becomes very unbalanced.  My rating for the 5 player game is only a 6.

The ruleset is familiar to Hannibal veterans. Finding the players for a long session is the problem.

If given a chance, I'd choose Successors over SoR. 
For me, the battle system is too random (too little impact from the bonus factors and too many dice rolling). That is my major dislike for the game (apart from the fact, that, as its a MP wargame, it basically goes down to all-against-one the moment one player gets the lead) and little or no storyline appears.

Still haven't find time to go through rules properly - I feel bad about it cause it seems it would be a nice shorter and easier supplement for Here I Stand... albeit with duller theme (I am currently out of my antics fever periods and who even cares about Rome in the times of kingdom?), but with similarly great asymmetric play.

For the same reason - being uninspired by antics for some time now - I still haven't played The Republic of Rome and Hoplite, although I am proud to have them in my collection and would never trade them away.

Update: I did trade this one away :-D Uninspiring subject (who cares about Rome in this period), never motivated enough to fight the rules (as I was with HIS), and found shorter HIS in Fief.

Very good if you find five people who can concentrate on input of a lot of rules the first time you play. Most interesting is that all factions play different. Each faction also has a different deck so it‘s another difficulty layer in not knowing what other players have in their decks if you play the first time.  There are a lot of strategic choices as expected. Some factions are clearly more difficult to play, not that they are unbalanced, but they require other more cunning strategies. There are also factions that are more flexible in strategy they can choose. The game has a strong bash the leader element in it. So expect the typical strategy of holding back in second position to win.

Very interesting take on the card driven games by GMT.  I really like the 4 player version of this game.

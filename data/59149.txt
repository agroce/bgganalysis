RATING: 4
Interesting party-style game. The rules overhead in terms of differentiation of card symbolism, and subsequent scoring, is akin to the permutations and possibilities of interactions in ONUW; steep and somewhat unforgiving learning curve. The difference in that designation being that ONUW is mechanically fairly easy to pickup, learning the roles takes time, and interaction mastery takes oodles of time. This shifts that difficulty to the front end, so much so that even sober and rather awake, three of us had trouble getting up to speed with the beginner/child variant and pretending to be the other mammal.

To that end, there is a decent amount of game if one is willing to view it in terms of rules mastery. Just getting up to the "normal" rules would take a handful of games alone. After a few games, the challenge shifts to refined execution; the ability to alter the fortunes of a leader is exceedingly difficult. Solidly better with more players.

Unique game, and I'm glad that I've had the opportunity to play it. It's one of the most intelligent party games I've played, however I find that the challenge and time crunch in ONUW combined with the role interactions make that a more interesting decision space than the time crunch effect in BBMM. BBMM is a game I'd only bring out for select occasions as a result...

Nette Idee, aber man muss dafür geschaffen sein und ob der langzeitspa gegeben ist, stell ich mal in Frage. Deshalb auch nur eine 5. Mann muss hier gemäß der ausliegenden Karten die richtigen Ohren am Kopf nachbilden, damit man möglichst viele Punkte kassiert. Schnelles umrechnen ist hier wichtig und das ist wirklcih schwer. Lustig wird es ein bißchen durch die Haltungen am Kopf die die Personen dabei einnehmen.

RATING: 7
Very unique speed puzzle game where one player (the hunter) reads a poem while placing cards on top of each other. Depending on what cards are showing dictates how each animal (and its ear/antler configuration) score. For instance, a moose with close antlers may initially be worth lots of points and then be worth negative points by the end-of-the-round. Thus players are constantly trying to evaluate the board and pick the right configuration. 

How do you pick? Well, you put your hands above your head and look absolutely ridiculous... that's how. 

Overall, this is a game that looks quite silly but is actually a very strong title. Attempting to pick the optimal configuration, without making a mistake with your hands, is frustrating and exhilarating at the same time. Furthermore, the game includes options to make it easier/harder for players, which is important for puzzle games. And the end-game scoring (2nd-place animal, of each player, dictates who win) even introduces a little bit of strategy to a rather tactical game. Basically, if you enjoy speed puzzle games, this game is worth a look.

That being said, I've received a fairly mixed reception to this game. Besides the quirky gameplay, the game rotates the hunter role, which also score players at the end of the round. If the hunter isn't familiar with the game, scoring will be painstakingly long especially as players can't put their hands down until their score is resolved. Furthermore, the very nature of this game can be quite tiring for some players. And god helps you if someone has bad body odor.

It's a very nice idea for a party game but I'm not sure it works so well when applied. The game works ok for a few times but I don't see any replayability. Gets pretty tiring after a while. However it seems great as a kids game.

A fresh and hilarious party game!  Players must adapt their bunny ears or moose antlers to an ever changing array of cards until the hunter freezes the players.  Players score points for how well their current pose matches the current array of cards.  Overall, this would make a great party game.  However, the rules can be very confusing to those that aren't typically gamers.  My fear is that the rules system will be too complicated for the party gamer crowd, and the simplified rules won't be enough of a challenge for the gamer crowd, which is unfortunate since the game is so much fun!

Only one game so far but I wouldn't describe it as fun. The rules are quite murky in places and caused at least five minutes of argument though I did like the accompanying illustrations. The cards are too small and difficult to see if you aren't right next to them. Losing points because the drawings are difficult to distinguish is frustrating, not fun. The scoring can take a while and it's a pain to hold poses for that length of time. Watching other people being elbowed in the head can provide only so much entertainment...

RATING: 4
This is a silly party game. If you couldn't tell by looking at the pictures. Seriously.

Players take turns reading a poem while flipping over cards that show bunnies or meese with ears of varying types. (i.e.: moose antlers up/down, compact or spread out, &c.) with point values assigned to those ear types. The player reading the poem lays out a display of 6 cards, and then overlays previously laid cards as the people around frantically use their hands to make fake ears, changing their ears to reflect what the positive cards are calling for. Once a hunter card is drawn everyone is forced to freeze, and they score points based on the type of ears that they're showing. Players have two pawns: one bunny, one moose, and the score is the spot that the lowest one is standing on. If one type of animal keeps scoring beaucoup points while the other isn't, it's possible to force the movement of the opposite pawn by sticking out your tongue while you're doing the ear thing.

One significant annoyance is that the singular poem gets exhausting even after a single play. Someone needs to do an expansion book of poems for this to make it more variable. A second is the card art; while cute, it is not distinct enough, and it's critical to know what a card is asking for to play it effectively.

This is the classic case study of a game that sounds better in theory than it is fun in practice. The idea is neat, watching people play it for a few minutes is funny, but it doesn't have enough actual game or even activity to be compelling beyond an initial play. I respect the designer for going out on a real limb and doing something wacky, but I don't think I need to play it again. I think even for casual players the same issues would exist, it's just too simple and is too lacking in variation.

RATING: 6
A chaotic and silly game, rules are simple, but not always easy/intuitive to understand (there's at least one in every group who DOES NOT GET IT). Depending on the speed of the reader, point values for certain features may change rapidly and there's always the possibility of getting utterly confused by the ever-changing cards. That said, there's a definite method to the madness, and experienced players will almost always be able to advance the piece that they need to. As with Galaxy Trucker (another chaotic Vlaada game), Bunny Bunny Moose Moose is best (=most enjoyable) while people have no idea what they are doing.

"Rabbit season!" 'Moose season!' "Rabbit season!" 'Moose season!' "Moose season!" 'Rabbit season!' "AHA!" 'GAH!'

You may not have any idea what is going on, which is kinda fun. But 'kinda' is a funny word, kinda. In some cases it means nothing, in others, it means everything. You will all look goofy and feel desperately uncertain if you have your hands up the right way until the round ends with the hunter and you realize you are the wrong type of animal. It's unique and crazy, but how often would you really want to play it?

RATING: 6
A frantic silly group game with a simon-says vibe. A changing set of criteria determines your score on the 'moose track' and the 'bunny track', and your final score is the lowest of the two. 

The zany part is figuring out which orientation to put your hands in to get the highest score, yet every few seconds new cards area added which change the best play! Then play suddenly stops and you all look at each other in ridiculous poses, which is far more fun than you'd believe possible.

Ridiculous.   Just crazy, ridiculous.   Unfortunately, the card art is disappointing - despite being cute, it's too hard to decipher, which means the game shoots itself in the foot, since the whole point of the game is deciphering the scoring cards as quickly as possible.   The recitation poem gets old real fast too.   This is probably a lot better as a drinking game.  (But I don't drink, so....)

Could be my favorite Vlaada game, partly because its just a bit weird, in a really good way. I like that the leading player has to read a poem, I like the way the actions inspire idiocy.

The rules are simple, but the scoring is complicated on purpose because that's where the fun is! I like being the narrator so you can watch everyone else scramble to have the highest scoring hand positions. There are both simple and complex variants so you can play with children or adults. Game can get slow while you get used to how to score but future rounds will be faster.

Comments: Very silly game, good with the right people in the right mood, especially fun to watch others.  Rules are somewhat confusing, learning curve quite steep, and scoring quite complex, novelty can wear off.

Played twice so far.  It was mildly fun. Enjoyment is certain to vary wildly depending on the group and the setting, and honestly I think the audience for a game like this is very narrow, if it exists at all.  The scoring is a huge pain in the ass - too ponderous for a simple, goofy game like this.  But honestly, it needs to be convoluted otherwise it would be too easy to play perfectly.  So I guess I consider this to be a "noble failure" because of the mismatch between the light party feeling and the demanding, calculational scoring.

The different styles of rabbit ears are too difficult to distinguish.  Better graphics might have been enough to move the game from the trade pile into the main collection.

Not really much of a game. If you go too slowly most players will do the same thing, if you go too quickly it's just a mess. Scoring rubber-banding result in everyone having the same score frequently. Person revealing the cards betting on a player to keep them from not moving feels gimmicky. Not eager to play again but I probably would if people really wanted to.

If you want a party game that is silly and requires thinking as well as physical movement, this is it.

There's a very, very narrow sweet spot for how fast you read the cards. Too slow, and people can compute the optimal arrangement. Too fast, and it's just total randomness. That sweet spot is just too narrow to hit reliably, so this is only a rare player for us.

I HATE party games.  But I don't mind if this hits the table at all.  Maybe because I heart Vlaada?  Maybe because it actually makes me work my brain (but not in a deep-thinker kind of way, more like a "how do I quickly react and steer around this car crash" kind of way)?  Maybe because, deep down, I really love to impersonate a moose pretending to be a bunny?

Initial Rating: 5.5 (April 2015)

Vlaada Chvátil is one of my favorite game designers, in fact I always buy his games without doing any research at all. He always deliver something novel and Bunny Bunny moose Moose is not the exception. It is a light weird game, but it is a fun one. After reading the rules I thought I made a mistake buying the game but it is fun to play with the correct game group.

On the bad side, the scoring can be lengthy for such a silly game. Also at the end I was a bit tired of it, perhaps it should be shorter.

Bottom line, a keeper for now in game collection only because it is unique. I need to play it again to see if I really enjoy it.

Erm ... maybe a little unfair to give a numeric rating as the game bombed with the group I played it with and was canned after a round or three, but I've done it anyway..

Strange if original mix of pattern recognition and face-pulling. 

Graphical style aims it at kids but the numerous rules exceptions together with hazy interpretation issues with some of the card art baffled the adult group I played it with, so I don't know how well it would go down with all but the most patient and observant of kids.

Very silly (and well thought) party game. It would be great with some drinks but nobody drinks in my group!

RATING: 8
My rating is in full acknowledgment that most will not feel the same way.  When we played, the skepticism only grew as we worked our way through the rules - it was evident that some were inclined to hate it before we even started.  I guess I should feel glad they everyone still played along (probably because it was my birthday).

This game is in a bit of an awkward place because it is unusually complicated rules-wise for such a silly game, thus limiting its usefulness with casual/party gamers.  And it is probably too silly for more serious game players.

But personally I enjoy the challenge.  Once you get going, it's not as difficult as it seems, and it's usually pretty easy to figure out what the best combination is.  Scoring though is a pain.

Act a bunny or act a moose, or act a moose acting like a bunny, or act like a bunny acting like a moose. This is a silly party game that seems more involved than it really is. Saying that this is a "real time" thinking game makes the game sound more intimidating than the gameplay actually is. The gameplay is relatively smooth and well paced given the repeatable poem. That being said, the game is simply hilarious and funny to watch people making fools of themselves! I think I'd enjoy playing this as much as watching it be played. I'm sure that this game has a hard home to find in between what typical party gamers are accustomed to, and way too far center from what euro and ameritrash gamers would be willing to play. Nice to see Vlaada bringing forth more innovation into the realm of light filler/casual/party games.

RATING: 5
weird game, my brain had trouble with it.  Definitely fills a niche of its own though.  Not quite a dexterity game, this isn't ghost blitz or set where you think faster than the other person and win.  This one is more solitaire, and just trying to keep up with the cards as they flip around.

I'm not sure what I think of it.  The guy I was playing it with was annoying, so that may have tainted the experience.

This "party" game might even climb higher on the rating scale as we had a blast playing the first time.  If you're the reader - it is great fun to speed up reading the cards and the pace to keep the others a bit more mixed up.  Slow down and people have too much time to think about their options!  This game messes with your head a bit as you gotta quickly recognize what will get your figure ahead the most and then translate that thought into how you place your hands for the motion!  

Repeat plays in quick repetition lost the game some of it's luster.  I still like it - but you gotta be with a group of people that will get into the game, change the speed of reading the poem to keep people honest, etc...and probably avoid playing more than once every few weeks.  This is a perfect game for a change of pace!

A blast! Three ingenious ideas in one party game idea (the basic hand signals to match the optimum card combinations, the scoring track, and the winning condition). 
Why not a 10? Some concepts are hard (but not impossible) to explain and a bit counter-intuitive. Nothing for a quick game explained in a minute for the whole family. There are some easier variants in the back of the rulebook, but I would have preferred it the other way round: start with a quite simple family game (plus additional cards and rules to make it the really challenging game it is). It is a "9" because of that. 
I would deduct a further quarter point for the maximum of 6 players (could it be possible to make up a variant for more than six?) - but the really low price (at Essen!) makes more than up for that.

A very solid design. It's very reassuring to see that it is possible to design a party game with mechanisms that make you feel like you are playing a fine-tuned German gamer's game. The gameplay is absolutely hysterical, and there's no sign the usual annoyances we've learnt to expect from party games.

The rulebook is amazing: Extremely well written and illustrated, very clear and precise, easy to read, clever and fun. Very likely the best rulebook I've ever read.

I want to like this game. It certainly gets high marks for creativity. Its downfall and the same reason why I traded away Dungeon Lords is the complexity. Now bear in mind this game is not super complicated, its just too complicated for what it is. This is on the surface a light party game, but truly it is a party game made by a gamer. I was hoping that children 10 and 12 would be able to grasp and enjoy the goofy concept of placing fingers above their heads in the shape of antlers and bunny ears. But when it got down to the nitty gritty of it the cards were just too subtle. Now Vlaada forsaw this and marked the more complicated cards as such, but even then the level of subtely for the bunny ears is just too much. And trying to puzzle out who scored what while people have to hold their silly poses was also an inconvenience that Vlaada even himself notes in the rules. Again I would give this game another shot but convincing others to play it is going to be tough.

Personally I love it. Although at first I was a little bit bored by the 12-page rule book and almost didn't buy the game because of that.

The scoring system is really clever and I think the game is intresting and enjoyable every step of the way, which is more you can say for most of the (in)famous party games on offer. Love it I tell you! I even printed some poems and lyrics so that we don't have to recycle the forest poem.

..but, for reasons I can't quite concieve I found it hard to explain to most of my friends and family. I thought that everybody will have a blast and I ended up begging for someone to play with me. So beware.-

RATING: 7
Quite a wacky game! 
You try to get the best combo out of those cards by making a silly posture with your hands (and probably with tongue too). The game is a bit hard to explain but after everybody gets into playing, it goes rather smoothly.

The rhyme you recite when being a narrator is a small thing but adds A LOT to the feeling of the game. This is not a game that can be played many times in a row but definitely a game to be played with a bit of party-attitude.

And of course, one of the best thing about the game is how it differs from the others. Definitely worth a try ...and because of the low price, perhaps even to buy!

Yes, it is a really silly game and good fun to see your gaming friends sticking their tongues out but as a game, there is not much there. It is more or less an exercise in quick computing and visual perception (calculating the the best score based on the visual clues on the cards). What I did not like is the lack of interaction between the players, you could play this with two, or even on your own and it would almost be the same game. 

EDIT: I enjoyed it slightly more this time than the last time I played it, but still, I know that the sole reason why I like to play this at all is to see my friends making funny faces and saying things with their tongue stretched out. All that tells me is that I should play more hands-on party games. Maybe not this one.

I think everyones first play of this is infuriating. It's a chaotic mess of a game played in real time, which always turns certain gamers away. Many people have also voiced complaints about the mirror-imaging of the pictures. There are lots of things to cause stress here, but by the time you're on your 2nd play everything is much smoother and it's easy to accept the wacky light-hearted fun. Glad they brought this Vlada classic back.

And for games where the fun and laughs are in the timer-induced stress, I like more stress.

Very silly party game.  It is a shame that the scoring is so complicated otherwise it would attain a much greater following.  I recommend taking out the +/- cards and the Mooseface/Rabbittongue or Rabbitface/Moosetongue cards at first just to get people comfortable with the game.

My only real gripe is that the art is sometimes unclear, which is pretty important. This is especially true with the dual moose antlers.  While I don't expect something like this to get played all the time, I would have bought it if the cards were more iconic and readable at a glance.

Still, with people that know how to play and don't mind the overhead, this is a lot of fun.

A silly, overly complicated (the scoring, that is; takes a long time = not fun waiting, and a pain for the poor players holding a pose!) party game.

Players take turns narrating. Narrator first picks a player -- will score the same as that player. Then, narrator starts flipping cards into 6 slots; stop when Hunter card comes up; players freeze in current position. Cards show bunny ears (up or floppy, side of head or to), moose antlers (simple or complex, up or down), tongue in or out, moose or bunny; also, positive or negative point value or multiplier (x2 or -1). Players score bunny pts or moose pts depending on what they are (if neither -- eg one ear, one antler, etc -- score 0); move that token as many spaces forward on track. After 2 or 3 rounds, compare position of each players token furthest back -- most advanced wins.

I like almost all speed/pattern recognition games, but here you're dealing with way too many confusing rules, confusing cards, confusing gestures that can easily be misinterpreted.  In a word, it's confusing.  I like the unique idea of players taking turns reading a poem.  However, they could have included more than one poem!  Geez!  Note:  I might be a little too harsh because it was after midnight while we learned this game and I was super tired.  On the other hand, I don't envision my rating going up.

Interesting mix of a game. One one hand, its theme is too silly for serious gamers. On the other hand, its mechanics are too complex for light/party gamers. As such, it should be a party game for serious gamers, but it's really hard to sell like that. It should work okay with my family since I've taught them many complex games, but they also enjoy a silly theme every now and then. We'll see with a few more plays. Right now I have it rated fairly low: 6. That's simply because it falls into a hard-to-sell-to-either-type-of-gamer category.

A filler from one of the hottest designers in recent years Vlaada Chvatil. The Czech designer who brought us heavyweights like Through the Ages tries his hand at a silly party game and it turns out he is fallible after all. After churning out superb hit after hit over the past few years, it's surprising to see this misstep. The concept of Bunny Bunny Moose Moose sounds intriguing in theory, but fails in practice. Basically it's a game where one player slowly flips up cards that award or deduct points for various configurations of hands on top of the players' heads (forms of bunny ears and moose antlers), and eventually a card flips up that ends the round, and everyone scores points based on how well they match the cards. It sounds amusing and actually is amusing, but the fun dies during these periodic scoring intervals. First, players have to calculate each score by adding, subtracting, and multiplying based on the application of six cards to their hand configuration. This is tedious and drains the silly fun from the room. Second, players very frequently ends up with the exact same configuration, so after all that trouble, you've got the same result and no differentiation. Amusing fillers can be great fun when they work, but despite the potential this idea showed, this one didn't work. I'm sure this is just an aberration and Chvatil will be back to pumping out great Galaxy Trucker-caliber games in no time.

Very good, fun, silly party game by Vlaada Chvátil. Quite hard both mentally and physically as the scoring and your silly position constantly changes.

Silly and fun party game that however gets a lower rating just because the scoring part is too darn complicated.

Stupid, stupid party game. Play very drunk and only on the hardest rules- the 6-card game is way too easy so everybody stays within a couple of points of one another.

Intrigued to try as a family game with young nephew niece.

This game is fantastic if everyone is at the same skill level. 
The people that are good at it mixed with struggling people creates a disappointing experience.  

I personally love it, but it has not always been a stellar experience.  

The game really starts to shine once you layer on the tough cards with the long poem, but you've got to get people to that first.

Honestly, i found it a bit pointless.
and while u wait your turn to score ur points it is way to easy to adjust your hands.
not my kind of party game, sry

Didn't manage to actually get a game in, although tried several times. Far too complicated rules for what seems to be a silly party game.

Funny to observe and surprisingly well received by non-gamey types. Fun!

Quite a nice little party game, though might get tedious after a few playings. At least we've laughed a lot while playing this one and that is certainly a good thing!

A light and interesting family game from Wolfgang Kramer. Not knowing what your workers are going to do makes this an interesting exercise in risk management.

RATING: N/A
Picked this up yesterday - looks v nice on the table and I was pleased to have Wolfgang Kramer very kindly sign the box.

I'm sure this will go down well with my family.

A word on production values - just like Phoenicia last year the cardboard for the chits and buildings is very soggy and reeks of chemicals - at first sight it looks like Valley Games may be charging western prices for poorer Chinese production standards? The trick is to lay all of the pieces out on a table in a warmish room for 24 hours - they've now hardened off and are just fine.

If you are a Kramer fan (as I am) and you have kids, then confidently purchase this game.  This game will help them appreciate the importance of planning ahead, and it can be a nice exercise in mathematics.  However, it's the actual construction of a 3-D city that provides the true hook here.  There's no way around it: kids love this, and it even looks cool to adults (even non-gamers are impressed by this aspect of the game).

There is one fairly significant and noticeable drawback to this game, though.  Namely, the long setup and cleanup involved.  The components are fiddly when it comes to getting them just right in their appropriate spaces in the box, and they are supposed to be sorted during game play and when stored in the box.  I'm thinking about getting rid of the box insert and simply bagging all the pieces when they're in the box--this would eliminate the headache of getting them just right when placing them in the box.  Oh, and if the box is turned upright or jostled at all, the pieces go everywhere inside the box anyway, rendering the ten minutes you spent properly placing them in the box time wasted.

There was something in me that made me wonder why a Kramer and Witt game would end up being produced by Valley Games. With all respect, it sounded like it had to be passed up on by many others before it would reach a Valley Games desk, or else Kramer and Witt needed to have had an ulterior motive. I suspected the former, and I also suspect that it wasn't [i]just[/i] production cost that had caused this. 

Still, I have a soft spot for Hartmutt Witt alone (football and building games alike), and Wolfgang Kramer comes pretty close to being the designer I admire most. So I jumped on the first chance to play with the offspring of this curious game manage-a-trois.

Something in me dislikes to conclude that a game doesn't stand up well at all, if there has been a genuine attempt by at least one of those involved to make it truly outstanding. Heck, sensing an enthusiastic effort by the makers, on its own, can be all it takes to spark a sense of enjoyment in me, that can lift even the dreariest games to a tolerable level.

It is noticeably easier if the criticism is aimed at experienced masters of design who ought to know their own craft better by now. It is harder if that criticism can dampen the enthusiasm of an ambitious newcomer to the scene - an attitude that I admire, and applaud. And if it isn't clear to me who the game is actually aimed at, fair criticism gets all the more complicated.

You can sense that the people of Valley Games put an awful lot of enthusiasm, effort, and money, into making this resource management building game a 3D visual feast, stretching the laws of game production economics as far as they could.

But a much as it pains me to say it, the one aspect that irritated me most is also the bit that took a lot of production courage from Valley Games: the physical components. They got very close to getting it spectacularly right, but all that did, to me, was highlighting what was wrong with it: production quality and game functionality.

The cardboard used for the walls and roofs, that form the buildings, is so porous, that I feared that touching an edge would see the items flake apart. I can't see the components last well with even modest use, although the smell will disappear rapidly, and that's a good thing. I am probably too spoiled by the German production standard. Their denser an more tightly compressed cardboard bits and tiles, on the whole, can stand an awful lot of abuse. I don't know where these were produced, or if this is what Valley Games paid for, but, to me, it really falls well short of "the best". Valley Games has an obvious desire to produce, and be, "feasts for gamers". However, right behind this attitude walks the spectre of missed opportunities and not meeting expectations. And a-standards don't mix with b-grade material.

Still, I would be more forgiving if they passed that other test: functionality. The buildings do look fantastic once assembled, and they fit together easily, with the caveat that some joints will require some very fragile parts to survive. But all this visual stimulation is chrome. Glorious chrome, but 3D froth nevertheless. Sure, staged 3D erecting of walls without them falling over between rounds is part of the game, but it could easily be simulated in many other, and cheaper, ways. So although the kid in me enjoys the emerging spectacle on the table, presentation is only a secondary thrill.

The one requirement any game component has, that it cannot fall short on, is to serve its purpose. And any designer needs to make damn sure that the bits that matter do stand out. Here, the cute bits that are irrelevant are blown out of proportion, and most key information that does matter, is reduced to pixel sizes that can only be used as pin-ups in ants' lockers, or need a magnifying glass to decipher.

The whole game revolves around potential profit margins of contracts, and type of workers needed to erect the components that are involved. They couldn't have obscured these key bits of info more if they had tried. Given the production costs, demanding play aids that made it very clear what building requires what worker would be greedy, but at least design cards and walls so that this is instantly glancable from a reasonable distance, not decryptable after close inspection only.

And this is why I am confused about who this game is actually for. There is much in this game that suggests it is aimed at families more than gamers. But for the family market, this "ease of use" aspect matters more than anything else. If Valley Games sees this as a bridge production to a wider market, I seriously suggest they rethink their design attitude. Only gamers will put up with components that need extra work, a wider audience won't.

I haven't heard many comments about this so far, so either I am seeing problems where there are none, or I am simply more brutal about ignoring admirable intentions. As I said, I am no fan of penning criticism that can only be utterly deflating to those lovely lunatics who felt they had taken on a challenging project and still gone an [i]extra[/i] mile. In a way, I certainly feel they have, and I appreciate and applaud that. But this is something I do want to say, rather than gloss over. To me, it matters on many levels. I don't often talk about game components in my comments, but here they are an actual feature, and made to woaw. To me, they fell well short on far too many levels, regardless who this was aimed at.

And who is this aimed at?

Part of me can't believe that 2 great designers came together and made something this arbitrary, unbalanced, and opportunistic. Oh, I certainly can see a group of people who would have great fun out of this, for the same reason that arbitrary costs and rewards, unbalanced design, and almost inconsequential game decisions never stopped A Game of Life from being very suitable and a heap of fun for its audience.

But knowing the minds it came out of, and as a gamer, I'm finding few reason not to zoom in on how it would appeal to gamers. And then I am having a hard time to even this as a finished product. Instead, playing this was like working my way through an ambitious prototype that is still in need of some serious play-testing. One that is full of promises and a lovely idea at its core, but also one still plagued by many frustrating quirks that are a direct results of design choices, and gaps. Very unsatisfactory.

And where I am usually able to pin down one element that would improve the game markedly for me, here I am looking at so much half-arsed scaffolding I am at a total loss.

Each player starts with a cash amount. Throughout the game, you invest this into acquiring crew and contracts, and completion of contracts results in profits, that can be re-invested. Different contracts require different crews, you can hire and fire, and more reliable and able work-force has a higher wage cost that will eat into your profits. Events affect your workers, and the fickle ones are affected more often. I like all that.

Right up until the moment I realized how few buildings there were, how few rounds we would be playing, how important seating order was when contracts came up, how problematic it is to pick a crew before you knew what contract you had a chance to get your hands on, how disproportionate and seemingly arbitrary profits are in relation to actual investment, and how important cash on hands is when the contracts come up.

That last point first. Some contracts can pay out insanely handsome profits on turn 2. Maybe even 1, I can't remember that bit, but walls, I am looking at you. Others need at least 3 turns to complete and can keep you cash-strapped in crucial phases, as acquiring new capital is triggered by contract completion. If your first contract(s) were more crew demanding, you're likely to be very short of cash going into turn 3. The person who completed a wall will be able to pick up any available contracts insanely cheap that turn. All because you cannot take out a lone to push the value of a contract up to something more reasonable in relation to its return, especially to someone who already has a sizeable crew and cash on hand. Which sets them up for even greater quick rewards. Something you might be able to counter through a clever mid to long-term strategy, but not in a 4 or 6 round game! Here you almost need an equally arbitrary and unplanned events to swing that advantage around, something that is hardly a fulfilling experience when it happens.

And, to my frustration, not only are you prohibited from picking up a loan during the bidding phase, you can only do that if you cannot afford to pay your workers. Now, realize that even a few thousand pounds can be enough to guarantee you can pick up a any and all contracts on offer, if others don't have cash to bid effectively against you (something that is more the rule than the exception in the early - crucial - stages). So, if, at the end of turn 2 when you pay the wages, you actually do have just enough money left to pay up, you are left cashless, and thus impotent. But if you were £1,000 short you can take out a very soft £30,000 loan and potentially reign supreme over the next contract round. 

Part of this game wants it to be the type of game that is played out over far more turns than the 4-6 we got, but there aren't enough buildings to do that.

Part of this wants it to be a spread-your-risk wisely game, but only a handful of totally random events make a mockery of the planning bit, and certain cards will take totally random players completely out of the game without being able to do anything about it. Again, exactly because of the handful of turns you get.

Part of this wants to be a game with skilful builder and risk management, but it just doesn't give you any gaming space to do that in. No workable advance information (get crew before contracts before blind event). No reasonable game length to put all the resources you do control, into a more meaningful framework than "the pot-luck hands of the gods".

Part of it wants to be a bidding game, but it then shoots all the bits that make a bidding phase meaningful out of the water.

How the chunky bits of money flow through this game creates problems everywhere it goes. And since there is no real penalty for not completing a contract, giving people the option to tackle loans when they need them, would only transform this game into the biggest analysis paralysis trap you could set for people who can do the maths well. It so doesn't want to be that sort of game either.

I do like several of the underlying ideas here, but for Master Builders like Mr Witt and Mr Kramer, this is shoddy workmanship. I'm sure that if Valley Games hadn't been insane enough to make this as visually striking a it is, this game would be hounded out of town, and rightly so. But I guess, for the same reason I am finding it hard to write up why it falls well short (for me), it must have been equally hard for a publisher, with maybe more heart than head, not to get totally carried away.

But that its wasn't published on their home turf by companies that are far better equipped to deal with chunky projects than Valley Games should have been a warning sign. I'm not sure if well-intended and infectious enthusiasm is always a good thing.

Rating based on one play at BGG.CON '08.  Oh, how I wanted to like this game!  Such gorgeous bits, so much fun putting the little cardboard buildings together, and so little fun with the rest of the game.  Some phases happen in counter-intuitive order (for example, you have to hire workers before even seeing which buildings will be available to build), and there was too much luck in the worker market for my taste.  This might be a decent little game with some house rules, but I doubt I want to invest the time and money into it.

I enjoyed this, but it can be a bit unforgiving if you screw up your first contact. Also, it's one of those games where you're bidding for stuff right out of the gates but it's completely unclear how to evaluate what you're bidding on. On the flip side, though, it's short, clean, and visually appealing. And once you get the hang of it, I generally like bidding games and feel Like this one works.

Master Builder feels like a poor man's Princes of Florence but with more luck and flashy components. Being able to physically build the city walls and buildings out of thick cardboard pieces is pretty cool.  But there's a significant amount of luck that will turn a lot of people off.  There's also a negative disaster-mitigation vibe around the game in that all of the workers needed to help build the buildings are losers with varying amounts of negative characteristics.  In order to be sure that a building can be finished, one needs to hire a lot more workers than should be necessary, because it's probable that a lot of them will quit or not show up on any given day.  This theme lends some humor and lightness to the game, but also a lot of frustration. Besides that, there are a number of things that feel a little off about how the game works.  It can be hard to plan, and the fact that you can only take out loans when you need to pay your workers can really throw off your game during auctions.  Also, the cardboard components are smelly and seem more fragile than I'd like.  There's a decent game in there, and it looks beautiful on the table, but it's similar enough to Princes of Florence or even Leonardo da Vinci that I won't be bringing it out much.

Cute components, and the idea of building a village as the game goes on is really nice, and is part of the game mechanism (not only a decorative feature), since you have to decide which builder will work on which part of a building.

Unfortunately, the game isn't that thrilling: the auction part is a little shallow, and the management of the workers and the money not that exciting...

RATING: 6
Visually impressive game with a high toy factor in the 3D buildings, despite the boring and unappealing box. You hire and use workers to build parts of the buildings from auctioned contracts. Each building section requires a number of workers with different skill levels. You pay salaries and receive money from completed buildings, and the player with most money after a maximum of six rounds wins.

The game is fine, but something feels a little off. The outcome seems to depend a lot on the auction of the last few contracts and whether or not the players fulfill them. Random events, which cause workers to be lost or become unavailable for the round, may really impact a player's plans, but the rulebook includes a variant where the cards are revealed in advance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
'vaguely' interesting 'optimization' and auction game. I'm not sure the auction part, while the 'central' activity is really the heart of the game more then just managing you 'workers' and there turn by turn wages to optimize the amount of work versus the cost. I'm rating it a 6.5 after one play.

It's cute, I'll give it that. But seriously, the events introduce random hoseage which is exacerbated by the tight pace of the game. If you are ruined financially by an event in turn 3, can you seriously expect to recover by the end of turn 6? Also, the rules on loans are, I suspect, too restrictive.

This game has no clear target audience, I'm afraid - the pretty buildings will enchant children, but for the younger ones it is too frustrating and hard, while for serious gamers the game is too unpredictable. I still had a good amount of fun with the game, and it looks as cute as no other (too bad that the card design doesn't really stand up to the design of the building).

Master Builder is another attempt to bring POF (Princes of Florence) down to a family level, this time it succeeds where Colosseum failed IMO. 

The game time here matches the depth of the game from what I remember, should be 60 to 90 minutes depending on player number. Essentially another game where you are trying to fill contracts, you fill them by having the right amount and right kind of workers which help you to build part of the city. The theme does stand out in this city-building game mainly because you really do build a 3D city which ends up looking pretty cool. 

Very simple and straight forward rules this time which lends itself well to the family audience. Definitely some planning involved but overall a light midweight at best and as I mentioned the time matches this time around. Some randomness with the events that come up, these can tie up your workers and delay work getting done but there was sometimes compensation for this if I remember correctly and some events were actually optional, some of these can still hurt though.

This game has nifty components. Unfortunately, it has gameplay with several large random elements, including what builders are available to be bought, how many contracts come out, and the random event. As a result, the valuation of the buildings is practically impossible, and the game comes strongly down to luck of draw. In a longer game (combine two Master Builder sets?), a lot of these luck elements might work their way out, but it definitely doesn't feel they do within the game as written. Thus, Master Builder becomes a light game that is mostly about its nifty components. But, at that point, I could play Loopin' Louie.

It's hard to know how a Kramer game can go so wrong. It's a lottery. Draft a bunch of people. Hope contracts come out that match what you've drafted, plus allow you to build things in the right sequence, when you have the people to spare and not beforehand. Hope event cards don't screw you up too badly - or overinvest in people to minimise the potential screwage and then have events arise that wouldn't have impacted you anyway. Have a small number of contracts so that the timing of when contracts come out, and what comes out, is absolutely critical to success and totally outside control. Don't provide any game cards to easily see what any tradespeople are required to build the first parts of each building. Instead, have people squint at minute icons from across the table to try and work it out. And make the game too long. 

At least the bits are nice. But I won't be playing again.

The 'dynamic workforce' in this game is quite fun, and I certainly wouldn't mind playing it again. However, the game isn't special enough to add to my collection.

Players 2-4, best with 3-4.  Weight 2.09.
The event cards can really mess you up.  Outcome is often based greatly on luck.  The money is hard to use-- would have been better with coins rather than with paper money.  With 2-players I'll rank it a 4 or 5, but with 3 players it is much better-- at least a 6.

This is a nice and neat auction and building game.
The 3D elements give the feeling that you are actually building something.
Not like in many other games where you just put down cards.
Just keep in mind that you can finish your buildings over several rounds.
Forgetting this, made me lose some money.

We just got this game from UCON 2013. It seems good, hard to say though. I am interested to play 3 or 4 player, but 2 player is so extremely competitive that it wasn't much fun...

Basically you can under bid the other player until they have no contracts and therefore no income, and then only you can buy new contracts... we fought tooth and nail the whole time just a to make a 5% profit.

I liked the buildings a lot, making the 3d village was a ton of fun. Will give this game a few more tries and see. Interesting concept, lazy workers and all lol.

The basic idea is fine, but:
1. The 3-D cardstock buildings to be assembled during play are a bit gimmicky and inconvenient.
2. The random events each turn are too chaotic and can really screw you.

This is a lighter Kramer game, about the same complexity as Tycoon. Beautiful components as you would expect from a VG big box game. You actually build a little 3-D model village over the course of the game, which is great.

I'm amazed that they released this without telling anyone. Man, if I were those guys and actually got something finished I'd be shouting it from the rooftops.

Kind of a miss with really great bits. The theme is a good one and the bits and the idea behind the bits makes it an attractive game. So what went wrong? Well, there seems to be a cash shortage that kills the auction element of the game until the final few auctions, and when the auctions do ramp up it becomes a somewhat frustrating risk v benefit calculation based on the draw of the labour market card. All this makes for a dull exercise made all the more frustrating because you just know there COULD be a really good game in there somewhere.

Liked the idea of the 3D buildings, but componant quality is questionable.

Also the event cards can be really brutal and scupper your plans round after round if your unlucky.

Master Builder is a light city building game.

The 3D components are interesting but not that great looking. I don't see a lot of replay value in this game. I was disappointed with the personalities of the workers. They had the potential to make the game more interesting but they didn't really matter in the game. 

An average game.

Holy cow -- the event cards in this game can COMPLETELY screw you over.  Even then, I still found it fun.  And those buildings are insanely awesome.  My feeling is that two-player is not great, though.  Four was rather fun but I found it interesting that the contracts ran out.  Have to try with three.

An economic set-collection auction game with great bits, sadly ruined by way too much randomness (order in which workers and contracts are available, the way events come up)!

--- Summary ---
There are 6 (at most) rounds, each with 5 phases (start player changes clockwise each round):
1. Hire workers. 4 types (increasing skill levels), each in a deck of cards. Each worker has a mix of 1-3 traits (many of the events will key off these). The workers come up in random order, with only the currently available one (each type) visible. Players go around 3 times (in round 1, continue till everyone has 5 workers), though, hiring or firing (or passing) a single worker each time.
2. Auction contracts. Round 1, there will be n+1 available. Thereafter, draw a random Market card to determine how many are available. The contracts also come out in random order. They have a minimum bid price, and show the cash earned when that building is finished (as well as types of workers needed to build it). Place $5K on unpurchased contracts: if still unpurchased next round, remove contract from game.
3. Event. RANDOM order. These can provide/cost you extra money for allocating worker(s) to some event, or do something to all workers with a specific trait.There are variants included to reduce the resulting chaos (e.g., reveal the event at the start of the round)
4. Allocate workers, build buildings for which you have contracts. Buildings are 3-D constructions and look pretty cool ... maybe the best part of the game! Totally superfluous, but nice eye candy.
5. Get paid for buildings you finished, pay workers wages (if short on cash, take a loan; loans may be paid off at any time, but pay more interest if paying off after contract deck exhausted).
Game ends either after 6 rounds, or after the round after the one in which the last contract is acquired by a player. Unfinished buildings earn you their full reward less $20K for each unbuilt section (cannot go negative). Pay off loans. Most cash wins (no tie breaker).

RATING: N/A
Slightly boring and uninteresting game. Repeated decisions all the time and almost everything works meaning that there aren't difficult dicisions to make. The game works in a final picture though but the components are overall bad. The card board is of low quality and I'm afraid that this game wouldn't last long if played a lot.

It could be a good catch for newbies and older children because of its appearance.

This is a very light auction game in which players recruit workers and build a city.  There's a few small auctions in the game but the heart of it comes down to the workers.  Each turn some of your workers won't work.  You have to balance them out so you don't get overly affected.

The pieces are incredible.  When I say "you build a building" you literally build it.  The various building pieces go together and you end up with a 3D building.  The final presentation is very cool.

It's simple and easy to teach.  I think this could make a great family game.  For gamers, I don't think there's enough there to make it worth the while.

Updated to 7 - it's fun in 4! The players can break the workers' market by expanding too fast, but in a sense this is very realistic in terms of businesses and hiring.

Wow!  This game is a lot of fun, hiring workers to build projects that literally get built in front of us all with great 3-D cardboard bits.  True to life, the workers in this game are lazy, deceitful, sensitive, and bad-tempered, and you get to manage them all.

Phenomenal concept - city building with 3d buildings. Horrific execution - the game is neither fun, nor balanced. Its systems are too complex for children while its gameplay is too simplistic for adults. Most of the 3d buildings are walls, leaving your completed city as a bizarre and desolate walled in wasteland. The rules for bidding on contracts and taking loans lead to circumstances where you are better off gaming the system to wind up with loans you didn't need in order to force other players out of the game entirely. Bad luck or a poor decision in the first round of the game can result in being put in an unrecoverable last place. Not the worst game I've ever played, but it's certainly in the running.

The 3-D buildings are kind of neat, but there really isn't much of a game here.  You hire random workers in the hopes that the contracts going up for bid later would actually make use of them.  Then there are events that may cripple many of your people resulting in a waste of a round.  Master Builder felt like a concept not completely fleshed out and all it does is leaving you with the question of "that's it?"

Interesting game of employee management, and risk mitigation.  It's a little chaotic (by design), due to the workers'... issues ...and the events that come up, but it's certainly an eye-catching game, and pretty fun.

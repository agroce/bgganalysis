1 play. Territorial game set in, well do I need to say. I don't think we played the rules right but it was enough to get a good feel for the game. Worked well but it was nothing special and there are lots of other games like this

RATING: 6.5
Area control game that has a different feel to it and alot of subtleties as compared to the standard area control game.  

There are several ways to score points (2 different types of area control objectives or "projects", windmill scoring, and money), money is tight but can be used for extra actions, actions are very limited, giving you the feeling of always wanting to do more, and there is alot of detail to keep an eye on for scoring (especially since you often score on other people's turns).  

Very nice components, pasted on but pleasant theme, scales well from 2-5, although I enjoy just playing it as a 2-player.  Lots of opportunities for strategic play, despite the random card draw element.  

The windmill is part of the "advanced" rules, but I strongly recommend just using it right away as it isn't complex, and it adds to the overall depth of the game.

I still want to keep this game after 3 plays. I like the theme & some of the idea's, especially the biplane and ranger placement,. BUT some of the rules leave some questions open (windmil placement and wheel # for scoring) and in the end it  doesn't seem to hang togther enough to be maintain interest ( The dyanamics of placement and scoring seem very snakes and ladderish I in the long run.) A disapointing German game. Maybe one day I'll get a good game out of it or see it in a new light.

RATING: 5.5
{1 play, 5 players} Considering that a huge part of the game is capitalizing on your opponent's mistakes, I was surprised that I still liked it enough to want to try it again.  You're not trying to set things up for yourself so much (especially with 5 players) as you are trying to spot GIANT scoring opportunities... so it's kind of a puzzley solitaire game.  And the endgame really felt wonky.  FWIW, we played a "friendly" version where everyone helped you spot scoring triggers.  I suspect I'd really dislike playing the actual "unfriendly" way.  Actually, I suspect playing this again ANY way might lower my rating, but I am still curious.  So there's that, anyway.

RATING: 6
Wow, you can trigger off great big cascades of scoring in this game. That's fun! I'd like to play the basic game another time before trying the whole bit with the windmill track and all of that...

I think trying to drop people near other people instead of trying to carve out your own bit of Australia might be a good tactic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A deceptive game that requires more interaction with the other players than at first may seem obvious.  Rewards planning ahead and adapting to seize opportunities for scoring.  Game challenge increases with skills of players involved.  Windmill option adds some additional strategic elements, but is optional depending on player experience and desired feel of the game (its lighter without).  [GTI Code: AGSD]

Near the end of the game we discovered that we were playing wrong. To initiate the counting of a region, one must have exactly the indicated amount of rangers (we played 'at least').  This gives a totaly different gameplay. So I think we must give the game another chance.

RATING: 4
Australia is an area control game that actually feels more like a random exploration game due to the facedown industrial markers.  I believe that the scoring opportunities each round are very difficult to have much control over with 5 players.  Although I like the Rangers in the camp idea, there is a complete disconnect between the theme and gameplay.  Keep in mind that this is coming from someone who usually doesn't care about theme.

Australia is a lot more interesting than I expected it to be based on reading the rules. Knowing when to play rangers in order to finish the different projects, and even when to remove rangers to finish the projects takes strategy. Then when people change the status of the board before your turn you have to be able to think on your toes and change plans. The problem is that the game is a little bland and took a lot longer to play than expected. I just don't know if there is enough fun in the game to make it worth playing again. When we were done playing I felt like "that was OK," not like "I want to play that again." I already have enough games in my collection that are just OK, so one more isn't necessary.

A step down from the Mask trilogy, but not too far down. Very tactical, and there is room for clever play. I, unlike many others, do play with face down cards, as any strategical plans are ruined before your cleverly chosen card can be of any use. Just take the face down card, and move along.

RATING: 8
Very tactical area control game.  I played with two and there was scoring in abundance.  With two, you could also play with a bit more planning.  It's a game with good movement.  i.e., you can't stay static and protect your areas, you are moving from one area to another to try and score your points. I find I like games like this (Mexica, In the Shadow of the Emperor).  

Update July 2013 - played with four, finally.  A very tactical game, even more so than two player but not chaotic, if that makes sense. There is some long term planning...get in on others scoring.  It was better this play with four.  Bumped up to an 8.  A fine, quick, game.

2005.  2-5p, 60-90 min.  Enjoyable territory control game with interesting mechanics.  Need to try again.  Many good mechanisms mashed together into a "blah" game.  Must play with the windmill.  A game for gamers, not families.  It's chaotic and tactical because a lot can happen between your turns.  There's too much math; scoring happens on nearly every turn.  You need to piggyback for scoring (i.e., you need help from other players so you fnd yourself running between scoring "hot sots."  Like Samurai game but you are more free-wheeling, like in the game Africa but deeper.

Got this game in a trade. Played it two times without the windmill and two times with the windmill. The windmill throws some extra, and needed, meat into the game. I have only played it with 2 players and quite like it. I am quite sure I could play this game with my 7 and 9 year old as long as I keep the windmill out which, of course, would reduce the fun for me.

This is a horrible game.  The placing and moving of rangers is fine, but the "you didn't see the section so you don't get the bonus score" aspect makes the game unplayable to me.  I have no desire to play a game where someone who doesn't have to take any actions scores points simply because I didn't see the scoring chance.  And if I would ever get convinced to play this game again (which I won't) the other players can be prepared for a very, very long game as I check and re-check each section before I declare my turn over.

Area control game--rangers fly in to make improvement in the different Australian subsections or protect environmental aspects.  Nice colorful board.

There is ample room for clever play in Australia. Another BGGer commented that this game's target group might be the same as that of Zug um Zug. I'd say the game is somewhat more difficult - though not by that much.

The theme is not strong. Indeed, it might have just as easily been set in space with spaceships shuttling around and colonists/astronauts harvesting the resources of the universe. Indeed, that theme would make more sense, when you think of it. Erratic hop-from-a-to-b development/harvesting in space would make more sense than in Australia. But space setting don't sell too well here in Germany - so I hear...

So, the pasted-on theme (nasty word that) leaves me cold. Further, the graphic design unsettles me. I believe one could have made a similarly functional yet more realistic looking Australia (for instance the northern sub-tropical bits of Australia should have had the green provinces - that's where the jungle is etcetc). Result: No theme immersion whatsoever. It feels to me like an abstract game. So that leaves me with fairly lukewarm feelings despite the potential for clever players. Again, as so many games, it's obviously solid, clever and will be played frequently by some, but just somehow fails to engage me. Note that the rating reflects that feeling of mine.

So, while Zug um Zug might not allow for spectacular and clever plays in the manner of Australia, I find it a whole lot more enjoyable alternative to play with the family and non-gamer crowd (who might have trouble with Australia, while not with ZuZ anyway).

PS: Oh yeah, I don't see it's a majorities game as a further BGGer has described it.

This a dry, themeless area influence game that takes alot of, albeit simple, calculation.  This doesn't turn me away.  The way this game is setup allows for diverging strategies, and I like that.  You can go for quick points or settle in on scoring.  I definitely don't find there to be too much of a puzzle element, which saves on the AP and downtime, but then again, doesn't offer any interesting gameplay.  Short, simple and close to being too boring to play but not quite.  It teeters though.  Play it quick and it's fine.  I personally like games like this, such as ________(insert Kramer action point game here).  If you are new to this genre though, you would be better with Tikal or Torres.  This is almost like a new twist for old fans.

The rules aren't complex, yet they feel counterintuitive, and this game is a bit tricky to grasp.  I quite like the nature of the tradeoffs in the game, especially the way there are rewards for hanging back and maintaining your flexibility.  But I doubt it'll ever be top tier for me because it's one of those "did the player before me leave me a scoring opportunity" games.

There is more to this game than meets the eye and it plays well with two or 4 players (my experiences with it so far). I really like it and it went over very well with our group. This one is definitely going to be a regular. BTW, it is by no means a no-brainer. As the move possibilities increase the number of wonderful cascade scorings makes the winner quite unpredicatable even up to near the end.

Played once with 5 people, and I think it suffers from the same two problems as Alhambra: it combines mechanics that we've seen better in other places (for this game, El Grande and the action point series), and there is too much chaos between your turns and too little control in the card draws.  I won, but it felt accidental (I scored 50 points in a turn near the beginning of the game, having planned less than 20 of it).  With fewer people, I'd rather play Tikal than see if this gets better.

This game has nice little plastic pieces with alot of detail.  We recommend that you read the rules, play the game once, and then read through the formus here on bgg to make sure you really understand all the rules.  We play 2-player with stacks of 8 cards color-side down and without the windmill.  It takes several plays to get familiar with the board.  It gets fairly cluttered during the game, and I have some trouble telling the board spaces apart and which circles connect to each.  However, we appreciate the 2 different objectives to score each space, and the ways to achieve a scoring.  Although pricey, moving a ranger to a new circle is very powerful.  Don't overlook removing some of your own rangers in order to get the right number of rangers around spaces.  Getting the bonus for triggering a scoring is vital in a 2-player game, so try to make a move that will set off more than one scoring.

Windmill Variant, Drafting pool with face up card on top of each pile:

Australia is a cute tactical game by Wolfgang Kramer that is not an action point game, regardless of what some people have been trying to say ;-)

The basic idea is to fly your plane around Australia, drop off dudes, and attempt to either completely surround a territory, or to make sure there are a set number of people on the edge of a given territory. The game has a few layers to make things interesting, for instance, the existence of a money economy which forces one to put down fewer guys in trade for cash, which can be used to do interesting tricks on the board. The windmill also added some excitement to the game, and made for some more interesting tactical card use than would otherwise exist. 

This is a classic "Aha!" style game as well, and I rather liked that aspect of it. It does remind me of the Action Point games in that the person who wins is probably the person who analyzed the board a little more carefully, and was able to create just a few more scoring triggers. Those triggers are part of another thing I like: the game forces you to cooperate and to give the other players point to score yourself. There is a built in incentive to trigger any scoring that you can, because the person who does so generates some personal points. But there is also an incentive to just have your pieces in the right place at the right time, because a lot of pieces in a scoring area always generates plenty of points. One other typically Kramer touch is the lack of pieces that you have to work with. Players face an artificial shortage, and are forced to efficiently use pieces, and then move them to somewhere where they can be better used. Again, I like.

The bottom line: this isn't a heavy game by any means, but it functions very well as a medium weight, tactical filler. It seems to play pretty fast, and I would have no problem playing it again. Ultimately has fallen slightly in rating though, as I think Dorn's Baumeister von Arkadia does all of the things that I like in this game in a slightly heavier way.

This is the sort of German game that has made me realize that the "Golden Age" has come and gone, as once-great designers are now falling back on rehashed, tired mechanics, virtually transparent themes, and gameplay that is little more than a system of mechanics with no inspiration, ingenuity, or room for creative play.  Australia is suspiciously close in play to Web of Power/China but without any of the tension.  There's an irritating amount of bookkeeping and auditing in the game and there is literally nothing in this you can't get in at least 5 other (better) games that you probably already own.  There's absolutely nothing whatsoever in this game approaching a thematic element and the end result is a dry, shamefully derivative game from Mr. Kramer and Mr. Kiesling, both of whom are capable of SO much more than this dreck.

I played a test game and one game with friends. It was not a hit with one of them the other two felt it was fine but not stellar. I thought it was quite good. The game involves spotting the best play more than divergent strategies but you still need to look ahead and set up good moves so it still involves a deeper strategy. Think Checkers or Chess not Puerto Rico. To be clear though this is an area control game not a abstract strategy game.

dissapointing pieces. surely they could have come up with an endangered species from each part of the board to use instead of just koala's. I mean which national parks rangers are trying to preserve koala populations in the Indian ocean? The infrastructure tokens are equally ordinary in their sameness of approach. sure the outback needs some upgraded phone lines but it wouldn't take a lot of imagination to come up with a few other pictures. That aside my one game went well for me. I just got it. It helped that my cards were the colours I could use most of the time. jury is out but it seems fine.

I finally got around to playing this (and buying, since no once else in my group was biting). I don't understand what the negative response is about. Certainly you have to play with the windmill, but the game played perfectly well for me, and I have no complaints. Sure, it's a little light, but so what? I found plenty of opportunities for clever plays. I like the large point swings that are possible. The end game was a little anti-climactic though. I think tyhe game needs to end when the draw pile is empty. Maybe it's different with more players, but with 3, all projects were complete by the time the draw deck was exhausted, so remaining turns were just about adding rangers to the windmill for the final scoring, which kind of lost of the tension of forfeiting putting rangers on the board so as to put them on the windmill instead, which you get up until that point. 

Anyway, I found this very pleasant and look forward to playing again.

It's fast (45-60 minutes), with enough thinking to keep you on your toes (nothing brain-burning, though), and it's fun to execute a move that scores several "projects" and gets you a bunch of points!  Plus, it's fairly balanced.  We play with the decks face up.  I often forget to remove some of the cards and we end up scoring almost the entire board.  I haven't played the advanced game yet, but I think it will be interesting to have another option available.

Australia is a title I played very early in my gaming career. I remember little from that time, save that I thought the game had a rather lengthy endgame which seemed to drag for far longer than it needed to. After some years I was in a position to try the game anew, this time with the more advanced rules featuring the windmill. Australia is a 'simple' AP game: it knows about action points, although the number of ways you can spend them is rather limited. At first I was trying to complete areas on my own, and was not enjoying myself for the other players were happily raking in points for many areas. However, at some point they had to retreat their little guys, which allowed me to play the other players a bit better. There is some sort of balance here which ought to be fun to figure out its parameters of. Nevertheless, there doesn't seem to be much strategy to the entire game: it becomes a matter of placing yourself in tactically sound positions and hoping for the best, really.

This could be somewhat fun were it not for the fact that the game simply begins to drag about halfway through. There is very little variation in what you try to do and what you need to accomplish, and not knowing the industrial value of a territory before you fly your plane there makes long-term planning a bit of a crap shoot. Given that most areas got scored when the final cards were played meant that it was all about point hoarding a bit more efficiently than your opponents. Okay, that can be fun, but not when the game lasts for well over an hour. You really need more variation, which Australia unfortunately does not provide.

As it stands now, I won't play Australia again, not even with the windmill which [i]does[/i] allow for some interesting plays&mdash;although the strict rules for adding meeples to the windmill track make it less interesting at the same time. Were the game 50% shorter, I'd be more inclined to play. But then you end up with a title which I already have: Die Dolmengötter. It features a similar 'help the other'-mechanic (despite being enforced rather than simply being a good idea) but it ends in under half an hour. Compare that to the 3 times-as-long session of what is essentially a similar principle.

RATING: 7.25
Rating based on 5+ plays.  Mostly 2-player. We've tried playing with the cards faced up and down.  Many people debate the rules on the cards, but we've found that leaving them face up lets you do a lot more planning.  Otherwise, luck seems to control the outcome for the game.  Additionally, the game a lot more fun if you include the windmill too.  Provides some added tension and scoring options.

We do not play with the "if you miss a scoring, I get the finder's fee" rule.  I'd be in the dog house if we did that.  This game is stressful enough for my wife.

2006-08: this one wasn't really on my radar, but I couldn't pass up a fantastic deal and I did know enough about the game to know that it is worth a go.  Have thus far only attempted a two-player game with my 12-year-old son.  It ended abruptly mid-way over an attitude problem that had nothing to do with the game.  Want to give it another go.

First full play of the advanced game was good.  The windmill is an excellent mechanism and one not to be underestimated, especially in the latter third of the game when it's value is very high.

Components: Wonderful board and great plastic ranger pawns. I would prefer round koala tokens, to even further differentiate them from the industrial tokens. The windmill is near useless, as it can only been seen from one side of the board. The colored regions and subtle images on each are a pleasure to look at.

Experience: Very interesting. I enjoy the two primary scoring methods, and plotting my ranger distribution in order to score immediate points, and to piggy-back off another player's impending scoring. I like the Clans-ish incentive for triggering the scoring. A lot can happen between turns, as several players can clean out an area quickly, yet the game doesn't feel as volatile as, say, Dos Rios or Tongiaki, other games in which one's position can be radically altered between turns. It has a nice cooperative element, where we must work together to complete regions.

This game is very under-appreciated here on BGG. Yes, it is highly tactical due to the constantly changing board, but on every turn there are meaningful actions you can do, even if your plans were slightly different the last time around. And yes, there is luck, but the game is short, and it is quite exciting to flip up the numbers to see whether you can perhaps score a region immediately upon landing.

Players are attempting to complete conservation and industrialization (!!) projects in Tasmania-less Australia.  Players play cards to place rangers on the board, each location influencing two or more regions.  Regions are scored when all spots are taken (conservation) or when the exact number of rangers matching the industrialization number is met.  Each ranger is worth 1 or 2 vp, with a bonus to the player who spots the scoring opportunity.  A windmill variant makes the scoring slightly more complex.  Feels like a combination of the card/placement of Kardinal und Koenig with the "spot the scoring opportunity" of Africa.  Solid game.

This game does to Australia what "Africa" did for Africa. Which means - nothing at all, at least regarding the slapped on theme. This is a quite cerebral exercise of area enclosure and scoring, certainly not without it's charm, but with little to none theme flavour. The system is very elegant and unfussy and the game is quickly under way, but the more geeky the players are the slower the pace. Choosing your actions carefully is the main brain teaser in this game, and there are many scores to calculate and decisions to make before you do the "perfect" turn. But undeniably this is a game that works well and for that it can't be really faulted.

Pleasant area majority game with heaps of scoring occurring throughout the game.  You definitely have to be careful not to miss (not that easy) any scoring opportunities during the game because the rules state subsequent players can obtain the points if they are missed.  Downtime is kept under control by the two card limit, which reduces the amount of choices players have on their turn.  I like that money equals victory points and provides flexibility (change the suit of cards) if you don't have the cards you need.

I like this game. However, in order to be family friendly, it's maybe a little bit much calculations. What excites me the most is that you suddenly discover some great opportunities when you don't think you have any. I like that most of the spaces border two different areas. Also, I like the "jackpot" feeling when you put your farmer into one spot, and completes two areas at the same time, or the same are twice. A good game.

(2-5 players) A remix of El Grande ideas. Area majority played on area vertices instead of inside the areas. No direct attacking as in El Grande. The castillo from El Grande becomes an optional windmill element.

Not as much of a thinker as El Grande and decisions are not as tough since you are generally just trying to make the best of the cards you draw.  Also nice that scoring swings can bring a player up from the rear any time during the game, but it doesn't feel like the swings break the game in any way, it just makes you keep an eye out for defensive moves. Blue sea spaces can be a big source of points so make sure you get on one or more of those spaces.

Played the Advanced game. The more we played, the more we liked. When we ran out of Rangers, it became a more serious affair, with wrong decisions triggering big scores for other players. It works best when you can keep your Rangers working in groups, roaming over the land like ants. We had a lot of fun making aeroplane noises and practising our Strine. I'd like to play this again, there is more to think about here. It's remarkable how many twists on placing bits, moving bits and scoring points you can get from Germany. Australia is another winner for me. (Yes, I pulled off a final round victory too!)

I was hesitant to get this after reading the mixed reviews, but I'm glad I finally went with my gut and picked up a copy. Australia is an excellent game, and in my opinion it's one of Kramer & Kiesling's best. Just below Maharaja, equal with Torres, and above everything else. It's much more of a gamers game than I was anticipating too. Turns are tense, there are plenty of tough choices to make, and the area majority with the camps on the borders is clever. I really like the windmill aspect of the game too.

Right now I would say that it works best with 2 or 3 players, but I'm not at a point where I can say that difinitively yet.

I don't like this game at all. I'm Australian, and the theme is disturbingly bad. Scoring is so complex they make finding the scores part of the game, i.e. try to blame the players.

Not a bad game but it is like many Euro-style games you have played before.  The theme is extremely thin. It can be pasted onto any type of backdrop (the galaxy, computer net, colored graph paper) and still be the exact game.

Very good tactical game, perhaps as fun to play as Tikal. But what is with the sorry player aid cards?  Rules are controversial as well, but the game plays light and quick, and requires a vigilant eye for scoring opportunities.
Windmill rule is fine but the game piece is just plain clunky.  It is clumsy to use and its point value is not visible to all players.  My solution is to substitute a D12 for the windmill device.

Update: Given the lack of enthusiasm for Australia among my gaming partners, it was traded away for New England.  I still think it's a decent game.

It's an interesting game of tactical pick-up-and-deliver with a loosely attached theme. There are always more choices to make and think about than you can deal with, often resulting in some 'howzat!' moments when you spot a multiple scoring opportunity. Our game was quite close and we were left wanting to try it again. I'll update when we've played some more.

Australia is a game of constantly-changing situations.  It's tactical to the extreme, and players must be able to identify the ephemeral scoring opportunities and capitalize on them.  The game is driven by an interesting tension between cooperation and competition.  Rarely can you pull off a move that benefits only yourself, and even when it's possible it's probably not the best use of your very limited time.  The game has an incredible sense of movement and flux.  You'll need to step into the current hot spot with mercurial haste and then just as quickly abandon that site for some other endeavor.  I'm not sure why Australia hasn't been greeted more warmly.  Perhaps the Kramer/Kiesling enthusiasts are hoping for something more methodical and constructive, another Tikal or Torres or Java?  Australia is a very different sort of game, along the lines of a more freewheeling Samurai or a more decision-rich Africa.  Sorry for the Knizia comparisons, but this doesn't remind me of any other Kramer game.  It has maybe a bit of Expedition in it with the controlled chaos, the joint projects, the importance of not setting up the next player, and the "cool move" potential.  I recommend playing with the draw stacks face up.

A good game, one that gets more bad press than I think it deserves.

It is a very visually pretty game. The rules are simple to explain and new players pick up the basics quickly. 

However, the game offers a lot of tactical choices. The board can change a lot so it's hard to have a single strategy. You have to be on your toes and take advantage of every opportunity you can.

The way that the rangers occupy multiple regions adds a lot to the game, making it possible to make a single play that has many effects..

Classic Kramer/Kiesling game. A little bit lighter than we are used to, but a good solid family game. Probably same target group as "Ticket to Ride". The game works well with all combinations of players (2-5), but the game evolves differently with each combination. Player interference makes it almost impossible to plan ahead of your turn, but the optimum move is usually easy to spot so downtime is minimal. Each player should be able to score something every turn as every scoring will make it relatively easy to trigger the next. For the new type of family games (the German market is not for deep games at the moment) this is as good they get. I like better for each game I play.

It feels like an area control game, but actually it's not. Scoring is based on absolute numbers, not majorities. Interestingly, there are two ways to score each area, and the same pieces may score in several areas, as they are placed on intersections. The plastic miniatures are nice, but don't reduce the general abstractness very much. It may drag a little near the end.

Played my first game of this and won it handily, making a break for the lead on my last turn after languishing in the middle of the pack for most of the game. Strangely, that did not lead me to like the game more. Maybe it was a late night or something, but I found myself somewhat bored and disengaged most of the time. Possibly could be the group itself is one that is so focused on winning rather than having fun, that for me beating them is actually somewhat anti-climactic. Especially at a game that appears to offer some pretty wild swings in scores. I'd be more happy about the game if I won based on some totlly smart moves on my own part, but really I just won because I happened to be in a spot at the end that allowed me to cash in on three or four territories that had not been fully scored previously. Did I help this by placing my guys in the right spot? Sure. Did I know when I was placing them that I would score several dozen points and surge into the lead? Nope. So to some degree this was just dumb luck. I have nothing against dumb luck, but I would have been happier if I had more of an influence on the result.

Final verdict: Somewhat of a meh.

Great theme, and not as abstract as I thought it would be. Fly rangers all over the country to do conservation work. Whoever does the best job wins. Kind of surprised at the low score here on BGG, honestly. Much more of a game than the similarly themed but completely different Africa, which has almost no gameplay at all. Not sure about the windmill, though.

The games works... the rules are ok, but is is cold, lifeless.
The theme is asolutely absent.
Ok it is an euro, but I mean absolutely: even more so than in Tigris & Euphrates, for instance.
Net result: a game that works, I'd certainly rather play this than watch a soap on tv.

It's very dry and thinky. I don't much care for mechanics where players hope for others to miss scoring opportunities simply by not seeing them. The card constraint is an annoyance. AP might be an issue as well.

I don't need much from game themes, but this completely fails to evoke anything about Australia to me. It could have been set anywhere or nowhere.

One of my favorite Kramer games, and very easy to explain.  The bits are fantastic and the box insert is one of the best I own.  I am deducting points from this one due to occasionally dry and predictable gameplay.  Sometimes, though, this game really hums and everyone gets into it.

I was really enjoying the game until I saw the "if you don't see it, you don't get the extra 3 points" mechanism that made the game kind of suck for me.  But I haven't really come up with a better answer for the problem of missing the scoring until later in the game.  I give it a 7 only because I think with more experience you wouldn't miss scorings accidently.

RATING: 7
Kiesling & Kramer won't ever be my favourite design duo, but this is one of their designs that I find quite approachable possibly because it's a lot lighter than average. Don't let that fool you into thinking that this is a shallow game, there's a lot more depth here than the simple mechanics would suggest. You simply fly around the map adding men to the board trying to surround areas or reach a given total of pieces. The catch is you only have a few pieces to play with and taking them back gains you nothing. A solid 7 provided you don't mind tactical games where you're dependent on your right hand neighbour for a scoring opportunity. Nice presentation and bits.

I haven't played this in a while, but I brought it up from the basement with hopes of doing so again.  I have a husband who isn't big into games, and  I managed to bring this to the table.  We played the simple version, no windmill, which I thought was plenty fine, and he liked it enough to play another game.  So I do remember the game in a positive light and now want to move onto the windmill version, although I was a bit confused by the rules when reading it.  I generally stick with 7 ratings when I like a game, but haven't played it enough to fully judge it, but this one I did like and do want to bring out again.

RATING: 7
Don't believe the haters. Yes the theme is thin but not really worse than most other games and it really doesn't feel as "dry" as something like Alhambra. 

Lots of subtle strategy in this game and the windmill adds a little more so don't play without it, every play has multiple effects you need to watch so it is easy to miss the optimal move if your not careful, also if you miss scoring someone else can score your points. Optimalization is the key to the game and being analytical finding the best move or setting up/planning the best move. All around a good little area control game which works great for 2 or 3 people. 4 or maybe even 5 can play but probably too chaotic at those numbers, I suspect 3 to be the sweet spot. Reminds me a little of Tycoon but I like this more. Money is very tight and very very useful as sometimes your colors work against you and the money can overcome it, also the extra actions money can buy you are very critical to winning. Not hard to learn at all but the rules are a tad misleading so be sure to check the forums or re-read them after playing one game, playing wrong will subtract from the game as others have undoubtable done. 

Turns are taken fairly quickly although it 'can' be a little prone to AP (I found this out while playing very tired at 3am) , the game plays in about an hour so great mid-weight game. Great components, very crappy cards I recommend laminating and great box insert just like Tikal.

[u]UPDATE:[/u] 8 => 7 Scalability issue (too chaotic with more than 3) stops this from coming out more often

A good game that I enjoy. Alot of chances for clever play.Seems to get rated low here maybe because it is not a deep game like tikal or mexica.Better playing with the windmill as it gives another way to score some points.There is alot of disagreements about what the rules mean in the rule book.They could have done a better job clearing that up.

This is a very dry abstract area control game. I guess the theme is about as good as any but it has little relevance to gameplay. The game is not without merit though it is lighter than some of Kramer & Keisling's other games like Tikal & Java. I'm not sold on the windmill though, it seems more of a distraction than anything else.

Nice use-your-two-actions-to-place-your-meeps-to-score-points Euro, albeit that's a pretty crowded field.

Gameplay is nice and clean, but as after the opening few rounds a lot of it boils down to calculating which move gives you the most points relative to the other players (you often also score for others when you score for yourself), it can bog down if players want to invest the analysis time into screwing the last optimal point out of each turn.

China/Web of Power is probably my favourite game of this type, especially with 3 players.

Wow!  This game is so chaotic as to feel totally random.  After our play, the person who had logged 12+ plays (and finished last in our game) had no explanation for why the winner won or he lost so badly.  Because there is no strategy here.  You do what the cards tell you you can do and hope that everyone else gives you more points than they give anyone else.

BLECH!  What a disappointment from Kramer and Kiesling.

Lots of things to watch out for, as every play affects scoring in multiple areas, some locatons are more valuable that others.  The game can get to be a bit of a nail-biter if you are playing the full game, which adds the 'windmill' scoring.  Besides, it's a lot of fun to play... and it's got great bits.

The 'muggins' rule for missed scoring can swing a game, too... and it helps keep everyone involved in all players' turns.  More games should use a rule like this one.

Australia heralds from the designer of area-majority grand-daddy El Grande, and though my intent isn't to marginalize the game, it feels like simple "tinkering" to me. In El Grande, players' board access is determined by the King. In Australia, each player has their own such piece, and must spend actions to move it around. In El Grande, regions have a mostly-fixed value, but players' investment in those regions is quite dynamic. In Australia, regions have dynamic values, while players' investments in those regions are far more constrained and static. In El Grande, players make tradeoffs between greater board presence and a bigger pool of available pieces. In Australia, players make tradeoffs between quantity of board presence and cash accumulation, which can be used to buy free actions later in the game. Additionally, whereas El Grande is about steadily moving most or all of your cabolleros onto the board, Australia gives players a small pool of pieces (rangers), which must be periodically retracted and replaced. El Grande with four players is better than El Grande with three; five is best. Australia with three is better than Australia with four; two is probably best. Player pieces in El Grande impact exactly one region. Player pieces in Australia impact multiple regions. El Grande features a special scoring option that gives players access to any region on the board at specific times. Australia features a special scoring option that can only be accessed via specific regions of the board.

Perhaps to someone unacquainted with El Grande, the above description seems highly skewed. But at its core, Australia is a fairly clear-cut experiment. It is an explicit derivation from an earlier game, the designer's attempt to make the same concepts play to different strengths. The game works, but for this style of game, Kreta achieves much greater success.

First: I did enjoy it and look forward to playing again.  The essence of trying to get pieces into as many scoring positions as possible, rather than seeking out majorities certainly gave the game some freshness.
But: often I felt as though it was more like solving a puzzle than playing a game.  As the game evolves, there can be significant bonuses for locating multiple scoring opportunities, and it seems as though much effort is spent in finding and exploiting them, rather than playing in some strategic manner.
The essential character of the game is that you're placing men on points which will score multiple times, based on the number of regions they border.  Get lots of guys in spots that are on many multiple regions.  The other part of the game involves that puzzle - regions score when the number of men on their borders equals a certain hot number - and the player bringing the men to that number scores a bonus.  Seek out and exploit these opportunities for nice bonuses.

RATING: 6
Enjoyable simple tactical game which can already be played with two players. The nice plastic figures (planes, rangers) and the map add theme to an otherwise abstract game of placing influence. By giving each player only two actions (out of three choices) Kramer this time avoids the analysis paralysis trap he often falls into with his action point games (Tikal, Torres etc.).

The scoring is erratic, especially with the wind wheel. While introducing a welcome second scoring dimension, it doesn't work smoothly. The odd rule of rounding down the half of the rangers to be removed gives a decisive edge to the player placing the first ranger. Other players are either forced to constantly invest or otherwise give the points to this player. Also, the final location of the wind wheel has a strong influence on the final result. For future games, I prefer playing without it.

Although there probably won't be any future games. Australia is too average to stand out and warrant more table time.

Found the game very interesting on the first play, even though I came in 3rd.  The windmill seems to be fairly important towards winning, ignore it and you will almost certainly lose.  I don't think we used the gold for alternate actions as effectively as we could have, I think there is much more strategic depth to the game than at first glance.  It's no brain burner, but I think it has more merit than some reviewers have given it.  I'll rate it once I've played a few more games.

I was pleasantly surprised by this one at Flatcon.  It was unique and clever with really cool planes that you move around the board and are the main focus of where you can place rangers and stuff, but placing them can influence other territories, which is really cool when you find this awesome combination move that scores you tons of points. The windmill could be easier to manage...

Neat components, but the game just doesn't make a lot of thematic sense. There's a windmill piece that awards points and you can fly your park rangers around the country with your little airplane...feels like half of a game, like another board with a whole other set of mechanics in place might make this very interesting. As is, it's hard to see it as more than an abstract area control game with a theme pasted on.

Good game. Needs a couple of plays to get appreciated. Best to play with the windmill variant. Scoring goes up quickly, but a seemingly runaway leader can easily be caught up with.

This has brief similarities with games like Web of Power/China and Kreta and IMO, you absolutely MUST play with the Windmill.  Fly you plane all abouts "Down Under" disbursing your rangers into Australia's national parks and efficiently use your actions for area influence, triggering scoring bonuses, influencing the Windmill and accumulating dollars for victory points.  In the 1st half of the game, everything builds up superfast as all players jockey for the best camps & ships.  In the 2nd half, things start to plateau and level off as the larger Industrial tiles get more attention as players pursue VPs with limitations on their ranger supply and old positioning of camps & ship locations.  A fair amount of luck is in the game but also a fair amount of skill needed to put yourself in good positions for the right opportunities yo maximum rewards.

I'm a fan of area influence games and rank this game with Louis XIV and just below El Grande and Web of Power.

Started the evening in an Australian bar in West London watching the highlights of the Commonwealth Games and finished it playing a very enjoyable game of this Kramer / Kiesling 2005 creation.  As the boys from down under say: Australia, Australia we love you which is very hard for a pom to say.

A few notches above a family game both the basic and advanced games are very quick to pick up (assisted by a very useful reference card) and even a newbie or someone as bad as me will be able to discern some of the tactics early on.  The variety of ingredients in this game - scoring mechanisms, areas of influence (once again), the resource management (gold coins which played properly give you a variety of options pushing it up another notch towards a gamers game) and finally the chosing and playing of cards - offer several possible strategies which may take longer to discern.  Reasonable playing length, good production values, variety of point scoring opportunities and solid gaming ideas make Australia a board game I would like to revist often but it just doesnt have enough to stand out for me to part with my cash and commit to buying the game.

Falls squarely into the above average category.

It's a fine design, and it's a bit light, with a dose of luck. 

We used the variant of face up draw piles, and included the windmill, so it was as "good as it gets".

It could be worth playing again, but I wasn't too excited by it, and it may make an exit stage left...we'll see; perhaps another play is in order.

One of the games I used to play most often, when I was in the mood for El Grande but wanted an easier game.  A great alternative to El Grande.  Easier to take out, teach, and play.  Interesting twist by being an area control where the vertex matter instead of the spaces in between.  Basic is already good, but if one needs more depth the advanced version adds some interesting mechanics.

Very few people agree with me, but I found this to be a great game. I get happy already from setting it up. It is a majority game, but also a "don't miss a thing and be attentive all the time" kinda game. 

Very hard to find the right strategy since scoring points in the beginning can cost you points in the end and vica versa. So it is important to put your rangers on the right spot at the right time. Clever and simple at the same time.

Removing the tiles after scoring was the only problem my group had with this game.  Near the end everyone had the hang of it.  Players were surprised at the scoring combinations a cleaver player could come up with.  Played it with and without the wind mill.  I prefer without.

Interesting game of control and scoring where you have to use your ranger tiles and anticipate what the other players will do.  You must play with the windmill track to "get" the game.  Otherwise, it's just way too light.

04/02/06 Played a five player, basic game, once. I found Australia to be a bit dry (no pun intended). All tactics, no strategy, at least in the basic game I played. I have no idea if the advanced game changes this. Overall a so-so game. I'd play it again, I suppose, but hopefully not in the near future.

Don't expect a rather heavy tactical game with lots of choices to be made like we are used to from Kramer. It is rather a question of just paying close attention and of scanning the board for scoring opportunities. My expectations were too high, but the game is OK to play sometimes.

RATING: 7
Similar to Arkadia but not quite as eye catching and a little less exciting due to open points but definitely worth trying.

Allows you to make some big scoring moves as you can enclose more than one area at a time and score for the number of rangers on an industrial project.

Elegant design that affords many opportunities for clever plays.  I actually like the penalty of allowing subsequent players to discover your missed scoring opportunities.  Also, the excited anticipation of *hoping* that the turn rotation will reach you so that you can snatch an opportunity for some terrific play you've spotted is a true sweet spot in this game.  Australia is an underrated gem.

Tries really hard to be a gamer's game, but somewhere between the rules and the play experience something gets lost... the game offers no meaningful tension and feels much more chaotic than it ought to.

RATING: 7.5
This one didn't disappoint. You usually need to work with your opponents in order to score. Movement on the board is fairly free-form but you have a limited number of resources so optimization and opportunity are key. The windmill is the new Castillo. This one fits in between Web of Power & El Grande. UPDATE: knocked down half a point as this doesn't hit the table often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Too tactical to work for me as a multi-player game - planning long puzzle-like sequences of moves is fine for two, but with 4 there's too much chaos. Did I just say that? OK, Robo Rally excepted. Anyway, everybody knows Australia is just [gameid=10989] on steroids. The windmill helps, but not as much as the similar tracks in [gameid=1334]; game is still too one-dimensional.

Juego de mayorías en el que predomina la rapiña intentando aprovecharse de lo que hacen los otros. Cuando se juega con jugadores que van a que nadie se aproveche de ellos el juego brilla ya que se convierte en tenso y con decisiones muy interesantes y nada claras a pesar de unas reglas sencillísimas. 

El problema del juego es cuando se juega con jugadores que van a puntuar una zona, luego la de al lado, y luego recogen para irse a la siguiente. Si esto lo hacen dos jugadores y se van a ayudando va a ganar uno de ellos y el juego carece de interés.

Me recuerda a otro gran juego de mayorías, China, que si lo juegas con jugadores que no entienden como hay que jugarlo también te estropean la partida.

Area Control
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Area control game based on Australia. On their turn, a player either moves their plane, or play cards to put rangers in the region the plane is lcoated. Scoring for regions is triggered when all base camps contain rangers, and the coastal regions count as areas as well. I have only played once, but I enjoyed the game. It leaves you with wanting to play again and try different strategies. Do you try the coastal approach? Can you be more efficient in picking up your rangers then moving onto the next region? This game rewards planning and efficiency. Rating 7-7.5. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Untested. Per houjix's "Couples Games" list: "I love area majority games, but they typically don't work well with two as they tend to be back and forth one for one. Australia has a bizarre sort of majority where you place guys on the corners of regions. This means that every placement you make has some incidental affect on other areas. It adds back in the chaos needed to make a game like this work with two players. I like this one quite a bit and my girlfriend absolutely loves it."

Pretty good middleweight game that punishes inattentive players.  You're probably gamer enough to skip the basic version and use the windmill right away.  Thumbs down to the number of players dictating which colors can be used.  Seriously, how much money could that possibly have saved?

RATING: 7
Australia is perhaps the quickest and lightest of Kramer and Keisling's many area-majority games. Which is not to say that is is so very quick or light, but it gives lots of good fun play. Flying around Australia in an "aeroplane" is fun. Its a good gateway euro for your non-gamer friends.

Australia zips along with a multitude of tactical possibilities, and you have to pay attention all the time to what's going on.  It has a nice flow to it. The game starts out wide open, but the board fills up fast. The middle-game is a chaos of tactics because most good scoring moves also create new opportunities for following players.  As you approach the endgame you realize the fateful consequences of your early play - and you see that there is strategy here after all.  

A result of the way the regions score is that there are wild swings in scoring, but that there is also a certain amount of automatic balancing.  The laggards generally catch up to some degree.  Some games will have players leapfrogging each other with fat jumps.  It makes for a very fun family game.  My kids like it, my girlfriend likes it, and it even plays well with two.  

Be sure to remove some cards at the beginning. If you forget this set up rule, the endgame will drag horribly. The rules are ambiguous on this but I'd recommend removing 3 cards from each of the four stacks, at least.  The rulebook is ambiguous on many things for that matter. It ties with Maharaja for the worst translated ruleset. It does have a nice functional box insert.

BTW, the windmill rocks. The cool thing about the windmill is that the rewards seem slight at first, and the payoff does not come for several turns, and the investment of rangers on the windmill track is also a lot.  But once the chits start loading up that track again and again, then you will be glad if you have a majority on the windmill.  And then you get your rangers back, just when you need them most.  Beautiful.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Really enjoying this one although it may be a bit too chaotic.  The scoring swings are quite wild throughout the game but it still seems like more practice will improve the control over how and when they happen.  Also, we have yet to add in the windmill as the basic game is quite interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This area control game feels a little like Web of Power, in that you draw cards that tell you where you can place, and each region has a limited number of spots that can be filled up.  What makes this game unique is that each region can score twice: once when all its spots are filled, and once when the region contains exactly as many tokens as are specified on a tile (each spot can hold multiple tokens from the same player).  Another distinguishing point is that player tokens are very limited, so eventually you'll have to spend time picking up old tokens so that you can redeploy them elsewhere.  It's an interesting take on area control.

A real surprise!  After reading the rules, I thought for sure that this was going to be a mindnumbing repeatitive family game, it's much deeper - requires much more thinking & tactics than Ticket to Ride.  Quite clever & unique actually.  Families will learn to play this game quickly but it will be the real gamers who will win this.  

Be warned: Those who suffer from *analysis paralysis* should stay clear of this one because optimizing your move is the key to success.  Game is a bit repeatitive though towards the end, and quite fiddly throughout.  Luck is relatively minimal.  Like someone said, this is NOT a majority game.  Probably not good with 5-players, too much downtime and too little control - great with 3.

Rating goes up after a couple plays.  My early pick for SdJ along with "Niagara"

RATING: 5
Firstly, why are the rules inconsistent in the different languages and vague in some parts, it causes unnecessary confusion and hence accessibility, hurting the reputation of the game. Anyway, I tried to pin down the correct rules and made thematic sensible rulings. The first play with four became interesting as the game progressed, as resources became tight and scoring knowledge increased. And there is plenty of points to be had, it felt half of the game was spent doing the maths and pushing the vp markers, which makes for a dull gaming experience. Also suffers from the "Carc farm" visual problem in that it is difficult to see scoring connections. I think the main hurdle to making good decisions is that the distribution/breakdown of the industrialisation tiles and ranger cards isn't uniform and easy to remember.

This turned out to be a really interesting K&K area control game. The idea is you get this airplane. You can fly to any province, and then you play a card that matches the color of the spot your plan is in to drop X guys, where X is the number of guys on the card, similar to El Grande. Unlike in El Grande, your guys pop into these spots at the intersection of provinces, and they count towards scoring each province their spot is touching. There's no sharing spots, and you can't land your plane where someone else is sitting either. Scoring for each spot happens twice. First, the spot scores when a certain number of guys is standing around it, then again when every spot around the province is filled. All this also requires the scoring tile be revealed when someone sails a plane on it. The person who initiates scoring also gets some bonus points, so if you are careful you can really line up big combo turns. There are some other interesting bits about the rules here and there, but the point is this game was an unexpected pleasure. I say unexpected because the board looks like it was drawn in crayon or colored pencil. Everyone remarked they enjoyed the game, but the theme left them dry as bone.

This game is in my Top Ten.  This is a lighter Kramer/Kiesling game with a lot of strategy and a good bit of calculated luck as well.  Maneuvering your rangers around the board for multiple scoring in one turn is a rush, and worrying that the player to your right is about to steal your calculated move adds tension to the game.  Some complain about the theme, but this is the least of my concerns in a good game.  A little chaotic with five, but still a lot of fun.

I absolutely love the games this has been compared to (K&K, El Grande), but remain unsure of Australia after my first game. Far too much scoring and very derivite in that is seems to have ineffectively ripped off bits and pieces of other Kramer games. Also quite chaotic, with rangers flying in from everywhere. Perhaps this is the family game for junior El Grandians?

Anyway, the theme, even for an Aussie, is awful. What's with the industrialisation link and the rangers? Interested to play with the windmill and to see if further games are as ho-hum as my first.

RATING: 7
Have only played as a 2 player game so far.  It works very well as such.  Nice area control mechanics that require you keep an eye on what you may be setting up for the other player.  Big leaps of scoring so don't worry if you fall behind early on.  The rules were a little unclear on a few points of the game with even the Geek failing to provide a definite resolve.  It appears that pre-game agreement on how those points are tackled is the general rule of thumb.  Nice pieces.  Good fun.
***UPDATE***
Have now played with more players & found it works just as well. The windmill track fills up more quickly so you need to keep an eye on getting rangers on the track to snag some of those extra points!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
If the cards didn't limit the actions too much and impose a bit too much randomness, this would be an even better game.  As it is, it's still a good, reasonable length area control game.  After playing it again, I'm getting a sense that we're under-utilizing the extra payment options that may add another layer of subtlety to the game.  It's growing on me.

[b]Comments:[/b]
A bit of a sleeper from Kramer and Kiesling.  Did not seem to get the hype of other titles but it is a solid game.  Each player controls a group of Rangers, who are working on nature and industry projects in Australia during the 1920s. The game board shows 6 states, which are divided into 24 land or water regions. Every region contains a face down industrial counter and a face up nature counter. On the borders, you find bases (camps or ships), where the players place their Ranger pieces to score points.

Area control. Another K&K classic of simple rules and complex decisions. Do I go for rangers or money? Main board or ranger track? Score now or set up a bigger scoring opportunity for later? I enjoyed this far more than I had expected after reading some comments here. Play with the 'windmill' though unless playing with people new to gaming. Also, it is very unfortunate that the English ruleset (not the French, Italian, German or Dutch ones though) is very poorly edited, resulting in a number of misleading or unclear statements. Refer to the rules forum...I definitely found it worth the effort.

I certainly have no need to play this again with 5 players.  The downtime, while not terrible, was a little much for a game this light.  Interestingly, I think the game will feel considerably heavier the more you reduce the headcount.  I actually would welcome the opportunity to play this with 2 or 3 players, for which the rating might actually go up a bit.  A fun enough process, I just want a bit more control than 5 players allows.

Australia feels like an area control game, but it really isn't. It is mostly about populating areas with a specific numbers of rangers, or surrounding them completely, to claim score tiles, which are going also to benefit other players that have presence in the zone. At the end, the theme is absent, but the mechanics make this game an interesting one. I wonder why it went by so under radar.

A hyperelegant game of squares (or boxes, or dots or whatever, that paper and pencil game).  But, it's pretty cool that there are two different ways to score the boxes, and the gold mechanic gives you just enough extra control to keep the game tense.  But, that $%#@!* windmill.  Seriously.

1/13/07: Played again, finished dead last after a solid start. Liked it, increasing rating. Want to play some more.
2/01/07: Played again, was WAY ahead, got edged out at the very end. One more turn would have been great, but it didn't come. Upgraded rating another 0.5 to 7.5
2/08/07: Once again I came in last place, but this time I didn't start in the lead. I couldn't do anything right this game. Mistake after mistake, and bad beat after bad beat (the latter probably due to the former). One of these days I WILL conquer this game! And when I do, my rating will probably bump up to 9.
3/04/07: I finally won a game! I had to play with 2 newbies to do it, but at least I've won a game of Australia! I still like it.
12/24/08: It's been a loooong time since I played Australia... and I still suck at it. Came DFL in a 3p game with 2 newbies.

6/30/2010: I just dropped my rating to a 5. I haven't been liking this game the last few times I played it, and I never feel like playing it anymore, so it obviously shouldn't be rated as high as I had it. This game wasn't as good for me as I originally thought.

Good area control game where you are trying to place certain number of explorers in the area to score industrialization points, and/or surround the area with explorers to score preservation points.

RATING: 7
Fun game with thin theme.

Set in 1920s Australia, players control rangers who are vying to complete industrial and conservation projects around Tasmania-less Australia.

Cards are used to determine how many rangers/money players get to place/get. Game play smoothly. It's area control and players who 'see' the board will do well to get ahead by triggering multiple scoring in adjacent regions.

Light family fun though games do slow towards the end when players are trying to optimise each move they have. The graphic presentation is superb (the scoring track features lovely Indigenous art) although the project counters clutter up the board.

RATING: 7.5
This is really an enjoyable experience.  It is a blast flying your planes around as you scurry about the continent, trying to shore up points.  With the Windmill, this really becomes a wonderful multiple paths to victory game.

One of the things, that I really loved about it was the sense of development between the ramped up opening game, the plateau of the midgame, and the clean up of the end game.

There are a number of ways to play, but certainly there is a sense of development throughout the game, which forces different kinds of tactics, with a little bit of strategy thrown in.

Don't play without the windmill.

In my mind this takes whatever is worthwhile in KuK and transforms it into a great game.

Fans of games with power moves will love all that you can do with this.

At first glance it didn't appear there was much going on here, but boy was I wrong!  Fairly easy rules, but there is quite a bit of room for strategy.  Very tense throughout the game, since the scoring is sporadic and the players leapfrog each other in sometimes great bounds.

Scoring occurs on almost every turn and often more than once, so the pace is fast.  The possibilities on each turn are surprisingly brain-burning.  However, the calculations can be a bit much, akin to the various route possibilities in the second half of Age of Steam. Another downside for me on my initial play was that I was having trouble seeing all the boundaries on the map.  In fact, all three of us noticed a few areas that should have been scored earlier.  It's kind of like having to squint to really see soemthing far away.  For that reason, I'm not as sure about this game, but I would like to play it again.   My rating could change in either direction, although I would guess it will go down.

I'm a little surprised by the lack of buzz surrounding this game.  It's a pretty engaging area-control game with a few twists and nice bits.  The board fills quickly, and then players swoop in to intiate scoring rounds almost every turn thereafter.  The bonus for doing do seems hefty (three points), so it is important to start scoring rounds even if someone else will outscore you.

There are two twists that Australia offers to the area-influence genre:  influence is placed on area boundaries (not the areas themselves), and once properly exerted, said influence generates no further benefit.  Both twists have also been done better elsewhere, but Australia is just fine for a title marketed as a family game.  It runs a little long.

TRADED AWAY (10/16/06) --- Received this as a gift for Christmas 2005.  After playing it a couple times so far, I find that it's another worthwhile Kramer/Kiesling game, but not nearly as good as Java, Torres, and Maharaja.  However, the people I've played with have enjoyed it even more, perhaps because it's less abstract.  I find that you have less viable options than in some of their other games, but I certainly wouldn't mind playing a few more times to get a better sense of Australia -- UPDATE: Traded away after a couple more unsatisfying plays.  Problems I had with the game were: First, the rules were very unclear and the translation wrong at points.  Second, plastic bits just don't cut it for me.  Third, limiting color choice by the number of players just bugs me (like in Metro or Entdecker).  Fourth, it just didn't live up to the potential of Kramer and Kiesling... getting a good trade offer for it didn't hurt either.

(2 plays) An interesting area-control game with players putting influence on the borders of areas rather than the areas themselves. One nice feature is the way in which the players themselves actually control how the scoring goes.

One strategy note: I don't think the 3 coin cards are as valuable as one might think. Bear in mind that getting 3 more rangers down on an intersection can score you up to 12 victory points! At the end of the game, true, the flexibility that coins give you can be very handy, but I'd rather have the points, thanks.

I'm a Kramer/Kiesling fanboy. They design games I really enjoy. I joined the boardgaming hobby in 2010 and missed out on a lot of their earlier designs though. I've been slowly discovering those earlier games, like this one from 2005. Like most of their games, this one is one I really enjoy.

This game has fairly simple rules, with the complexity coming from the gameplay. On your turn you do one of three things. Move your plane, play a card (and draw a card) or pick up rangers. Playing cards is the heart of the game. There are four decks of cards. Each deck has some combination of four rangers/coins on the back (4 rangers, 3 rangers/1 coin, 2 rangers/2 coins, 1 ranger/3 coins). The front also has a terrain color.

In order to play a card, your airplane must be in a matching terrain color (or you can pay 3 coins to change the color of your card). You then take the coins on the card and place the rangers on one of the spots in the region your plane is in. All the rangers must go to the same spot. You're trying to achieve two goals by placing rangers. Complete a region by filling all the spots on its border completely (which scores the conservation tile in that territory) or fill the territory with the exact number of rangers shown on the industrialization tile (which scores the industrialization tile).

During scoring, whoever triggers the scoring (which can simply be from noticing that the scoring trigger condition has been met but not claimed) gets 3 points, then all players get points equal to the number of their rangers in that region.

You can also spend four coins to teleport one of your rangers to any spot on the board that isn't taken by an opponent. Which you'll want to do in order to snag juicy scoring opportunities.

There's also a windmill scoring mechanism. Whenever an industrialization tile is flipped over to show how many rangers in that region are needed (which happens when a plane lands in that region) you also check to see if the tile has a windmill on it. If it does, then you move the windmill to that region and increment the counter on the windmill (which ranges from 2 to 12). Whenever a player is placing rangers into a region which is in or borders the region where the windmill is, they have the option to put some of those rangers into the windmill track. Any scored tiles also go on the windmill area. When all the tile spots in the windmill area fill up, there is a windmill scoring. The player with the most rangers at the windmill wins points equal to the windmill value (ties going to whoever has the earliest ranger into the windmill). Second place gets half as much, etc. Then the earliest half of the rangers into the windmill are returned to the players.

Trying to figure out how to best use your cards is tricky. You want to get your rangers onto the board in positions where they'll score multiple regions. But other players might or might not help you with that. If they do, they'll also get points, but if they don't, you'll have to do it by yourself. But putting out a lot of rangers has issues... you won't get as many coins and you'll end up with rangers stranded in positions that don't help you, forcing you to teleport them or pick them up again. Money is really tight, so use your money wisely. There's a lot of interesting choices.

Not one of Kramer and Kiesling's best. Certainly has some strategic elements to the game but card draw just way too unpredictable and prevents long term planning. I also do not like the "gotcha" rule of having to score points if someone else forgets to initiate scoring. The model and sculpts are really well done though. I may be convinced to play once in a while but doubt this will stay in my collection for the long term. Tikal, java and mexico all triumph over this design.

I played a four player game of this at WBC 2005.  Unfortunately, we read the rules wrong.  We thought that you could place rangers in any region of the color where your plane was landed.  I am pretty sure this completely changes the game.  I like what I played, but I will have to try it again before I have any kind of real impression.

OK, now I have tried it again, this time with 5 players, the correct rules, but only the beginner's game.  Virtually every turn consists of flying to an area and placing rangers.  Whenever possible, you want to fly to an area where you can score because if you place men somewhere that won't score, you are making that area more attractive to others.  It's very hard to plan ahead.  You can, however, do some pretty sneaky things with the money.  Being able to moving one extra man anywhere is pretty powerful.  I also think that the windmill scoring in the full game will add a new element of planning to help offset the chaos.  I guess my opinion isn't final, especially without playing the full game, but I got a good impression and while it seems to be a pretty decent game, it doesn't really stand out much, either.

(After 1 5p basic rules game) I like area control and Kramer games so this "felt right" to me once I understood the 2 ways each region scored.  It is nice to see a new part of the world featured on a game, but the gameboard could have used a little more pizzaz.  The game might play better with fewer players - more planning and less helping of your opponents.  The plastic bits don't bother me.  The rules did seem a little unclear on some issues.

I think it gets a bad rap. Good bits, interesting decisions, lots of things to consider. The bonus for triggering scoring is an interesting incentive to score something you have a minor stake in, just to prevent other people from scoring too much more. The premise, however, feels downright silly -- I can't help but think of this as "aggressive conservation" ... Surround the poor animals and make sure they're ok before you destroy their habitat to make way for industrialization.

You want to minimize the amount of flying you do and to set up the regions in such a way as to be able to score multiples of them at once.  Of course you'd want as many rangers to be on the board when completing the conservation projects, after which you'd finish the industrialization ones while restocking your supply at the same time.  Not exactly rocket science here.

As a 2-player game (without the windmill variant) this was just an ok experience for me.  Not enough interaction or confrontation involved.  Almost felt like a solitaire.  With a less than exciting production value and theme, I was definitely not impressed.  Maybe with more people the tension would be more prevalent, something a good area control title should have.

Played this one with brother in law and my boys.  They like it, so I got it.  I thought it was good too.

This is so, so very opportunistic, tactical, and reactive that I couldn't really get into it.  Perhaps the standard offering of Kramer variants would liven it up for me; however, his variants typically don't change the core of the game, so I'm not holding my breath.

After 1 Play: Feels very generic despite the attempt at an interesting twist on area control - playing on the borders so each placement affects more than one region.

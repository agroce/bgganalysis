GAME: The Witches: A Discworld Game
RANK: 3039
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The theme and art is great. This game is a love letter to the witches series of Discworld books, which I love. The game itself is OK. Can be played competitive or co-op, though co-op feels like an added afterthought and could use some house rules to make it more interesting.

Light, but sturdy co-petitive game. The artwork is lovely and the game is pretty relaxing to play, even when you're losing badly.

Problem solving via dice rolls.  Very difficult to figure a strategy so far.  Always seem to get cards that I can't use (like solve a death problem when closest death problem is 5 spaces away behind 2 tough problems).

I really didn't like this game at all, it seems very unbalanced in a way that the rich always get richer and the poor always get more poor. The theme is OK, but nothing I would like to play again. Didn't played the coop variant, must be better a little bit, but for me it's ok to play this game just one time.

I REALLY wanted to like this game.  It has some good mechanics, but they all feels unfinished, not tested enought. After every play i feel like there has to be way to improve gameplay to be more balanced, more challanging, add more variability... but (imput: aint nobody got time for this - meme)

RATING: 2
The game flow is too random: random dice rolls mitigated by randomly shuffled cards for random rewards. The unique powers are underwhelming; the first player token is the only one with any appeal, as the minor challenges from which your hand size grows show up at a slower pace than the players solve them. 

Unforgiving too, since if your card hand ends up with no free movements, you'll have a hard time scoring anything for several turns while you try to cycle your cards. The rules pretend that you're still in the game, but you'll just have to sit here, powerless to grab the big points and too far to catch up with the small ones. 

It's too random to be hard strategy, too unforgiving to be family fun... The flavour that would be this game's selling point is absent aside from the map.

On top of that, the rules aren't well written; a cumbersome reference sheet will need to be passed around the table to find out the results of failing each of the bigger challenges.

I love Discworld and the Discworld universe. The game itself is very simplistic and would be neat to play with young kids and others who know and love the characters. The game itself, though, is not that exciting, which kinda makes me sad

RATING: 3
A group of gamers may quickly get bored with Witches'  repetition of move, roll dice and maybe resolve problem.  Witches also has an issue common to many semi-cooperative games.  There is no incentive for a player who sees little chance of an individual victory to co-operate.  The game even provides possibilities for negative play; turning up elven characters or repeatedly losing against some of the tougher characters to bring on crisis tokens.  

The artwork is quite nice.  My one complaint is that the connection between town and castle could have been clearer.  The rules make an awful hash of describing the key move/action/move/action turn sequence. I can imagine lots of families getting it wrong, finding the game unwinnable and consigning it to a dusty shelf.

A nice feel to this game which is pretty light and not too taxing. The first couple of turns are critical to get going: make sure you move, attempt problem, move attempt problem each turn (not move twice, then only attempt 1 problem a turn). If you do not, then crisis counters will run out.

A beautiful looking game that is a bit too simple with no way of slowing down players who get lucky early on. I enjoy it more as a laid back solo game instead.

Unlike Ankh-Morpork this is probably for fans of Discworld only.

Biggest disappointment ever. Discworld: Ankh-Morpork was really fun game. These two games use cards really heavily, but imho Witches has 0 strategy involved. Get good cards, roll dice, wait for game to end. Looks beautiful but is horrible inside.

Move to trouble, roll a pair of dice, if you think you'll reach a particular total with another two dice roll them, otherwise run away from the trouble. If you succeed you get points for game end, if not there's a penalty.

Gra, która ciężko jednoznacznie ocenić. Z jednej strony zaawansowani gracze będą się przy niej zwyczajnie nudzić, ponieważ jest to lekka, familijna gra. Ale właśnie z drugiej strony to bardzo ciekawa propozycja do zabawy w gronie rodzinnym lub z kobietą, która ma ochotę poturlać kostkami, ale nie lubi analizowania każdego posunięcia.

Disappointed by this one. If you are a Discworld fan, I think you may get some enjoyment out of the theme. Otherwise it isn't a great game (and it is much lighter than I was expecting). There is nothing particularly unique or interesting. I would say you could use it as a gateway, but it is so light it really isn't fit to even do that. 

For my money, Ankh-Morpork is a vastly superior game to this.

Tiradados sin sentido y completamente desequilibrado. El jugador que empieze la partida con mejores tiradas, va a estar siempre en cabeza, sin posibilidad de remontada por parte de los otros jugadores.

Una pena que una ambientación tan buena tenga juegos como este que no se la merecen.

It is lite, but it still presents some tactical decisions in terms of movement, blocking and hand management. There is some luck (if you roll 'cackles' all night you will lose) but it's at a level that is OK for the type of game it's trying to be. Not a game to be pulled out with hardcore 'gamers' but a good family/gateway game and definitely one for a fan of Discworld.

Nicely produced although not sure the 'Collectors' edition had quite enough extra to justify the price differential - I really just bought it to have the Treefrog box (how sad is that?)

The basic game play is very good, with one exception; the ways in which you can lose, one of them is completely outside of your control (loss by running out of crisis tokens) which limits the reliability of the game for me; of the five games we played: 1 of them we one, 1 we lost because we were learning the game, and the rest we lost simply because we ran out of crisis tokens very early in the game (with no failures and everyone attacking crisis with gusto)

RATING: 8
Szép, Discworldos, nagyon.
A játék: első 2 játékban vesztettünk, túl sok probléma jött fel, de mint kiderült mindkettőt rosszul játszottuk, és az elsőt még azzal is nehezítettük, h valszeg 2-vel több könnyű problémát tettünk fel a táblára. Ahogy kell :-)
H mit hibáztunk: a szabály azt mondja, hogy 1 v 2-t mozoghatsz, és 1 v 2-t léphetsz, mi ezt egybe mostuk: 1-et mozogtunk, ahol 1 v 2 mezőnyit léphettünk. Így komoly kihívás a játék legyőzése, de majdnem sikerült :-).
Aztán a fórumokat böngészve úgy tűnik, h nem is csak 1 vagy 2, hanem egyértelműen 2 mozgás van és nem választható, hogy 1 vagy 2, és mindegyik mozgás ahogy fentebb is: 1 vagy 2 lépésből áll. 
NA ennyit a kerülésről.
A játék: 
Boszorkányokkal vagyunk, járjuk Lancre vidékét, és próbáljuk a problémákat megoldani, amik, hogy kisebbek, hol nagyobbak. A mozgás során, ha problémába futunk meg kell állni, és meg kell próbálni megoldani. A megoldás: kocka dobás, 2+2 hatoldalú kocka, egyik oldal bolond -nullás- és a probléma nagyság számát kell megdobni. Kis problémák olyan 7-12, a nagyok 16-24 nagyságúak, plusz lehet rajtuk krízisjelző, ami még +2. 
A megoldás jól kitalálva: dob 2 kocka, eredmény láttán meg lehet futamodni -nincs köv- vagy ki lehet játszani észszerészet vagy mágia kártyákat -ezek bónuszok a dobáshoz-, de a mágia bár +2-t ad, ad 1 bolondkorongot is. Majd a maradék 2 dobás. Ha győztünk: a lapka a mienk -van pontértéke, ezt kell gyűjteni, ezzel lehet nyerni.
Kártyák: alapban 3, és ennyi az alap kézlimit is. De ahogy egyre több könnyű problémát oldunk meg, egyre több lap lehet a kezünkbe. A nehéz problémák megoldása pedig a probléma megoldó képességünk növeli: magyarul +1-t kapunk a dobásunkhoz.
Aztán a kártyáknak vannak képességeik is, és azokat is használhatjuk, ezek mindenféle jó dolgok, pl. bolondkorong eldobások, ne gyűljön, vagy kocka újradobás, vagy láthatatlanság, és átmehetünk problémás helyen, stb....
HA nem sikerül a problémát megoldani: kriziskorong rá, +2 nehezítés. A nehéz problémáknál, a probléma függvényében más negatívumok is lehetnek.
A másik lépés eredmény: ha olyan helyre lépünk, ahol másik boszi áll: leülnek teázni, 3 ill. 2 bolondkorongot el lehet dobni.
És mint az elején írtam: ez a mozgás+megálló hely függvényű akciót 2x kell eljátszani a körünkbe.
Majd a végén a lapjaink kézlimitre töltjük.
Játék vége: ha a problématalonból az utolsó is felkerül. Az nyer, akinek a legtöbb pontja van a problémák megoldásából.
Viszont lehet veszteni is a játék ellen: ha 3 tündér látszik van fent képpel felfelé a táblán, mint probléma vagy ha kriziskorongot kéne feltenni a táblára és nincs. Ez utóbbi ugyanis nem csak akkor kerül fel, ha nem sikerül megoldani egy problémát, hanem minden játékos minden köre előtt van egy probléma felpakolás, ami úgy zajlik, h addig húzunk lapokat, míg olyan nem jön fel, ahol nincs probléma, akkor odatesszük a problémát. Az addig felhúzott problémás helyekre viszont kriziskorongot teszünk fel.... na ebbe buktunk bele 2x :-)
Amúgy jól adja a világ hangulatát, mind képileg, mind szellemileg: a boszorkáknak össze is kell fogniuk, h ne legyen túl nagy a krizis, de mindenki a saját pecsenyéjét sütögeti azért, mert mégis csak boszik vagyunk, vagy mi.
A játék családi, sajnos nyelvfüggő, igaz csak 55 lap :-)
Update: na minden szabályt helyesen játszva, azért esélye sem volt a játéknak nyerni. :-). Könnyed-vidám-gyors családi darab, jó

Many people seem to complain about it being too luck-based, but i would say that it's almost more of a push-your-luck style game, where you have to decide how many of your cards (and at what capacity) you want to commit before you roll the dice.

RATING: 4
It's such a misleading game. The premise is simple and enticing. It's billed as a sequel, of sorts, to Ankh Morpork, which is a decently fun game, BUT, it has infantile mechanics and is infuriatingly silly. Once any player takes the lead it is nigh on impossible for someone else to catch up. And that's the game...you play until someone takes the lead. It's not necessary to finish as each round is an exact cookie cutout of the previous round. Boring, lame dynamics, no replay value. I might play it again, but only with kids younger than 8, as anyone older would become bored before the end of the first play-through.

Beautifully produced. Love the artwork and of course I love the setting. As with the other Martin Wallace Discworld game, this game will go much farther with fans of Terry Pratchett.

Who is this game for?

The gameplay is intensely boring-- the few ways to affect die rolls let you reduce risk, but barely provide any more control.

Theme... the place names, card names and tile names are all taken from Discworld but they could really be anything.

The semi-coop aspect has the "dirty dishes" problem, where whoever is most willing to ignore cooperation and let crises pile up gets rewarded by having more freedom of choice with problems.

So bad.

My rating of six out of ten stars is for the 100% co-op, after three plays it gets a bit tedious. There is no real incentive to cooperate, too little dependency on one another. Therefore I created the co-op variant The Consequences of Madness to counteract these drawbacks. This works great, and since I am a great fan of the Discworld, for me it is a nice game design toolbox I used to create something nice :-).

A very light game that is a good filler. It's a fun game with good dynamics. It is quite easy to play and win however, it may take you one or two games to figure out how to create a winning formula. The Discworld theme is very well executed even though I know only a tiny bit about it. 

There is a fantastic balance in that the game is cooperative but only one person will win or else everybody will loose. Thus, the game starts heavily cooperative but players end up taking more risks to gain more points for themselves to win at the expense of the team. 

Fun for all ages but also very light in case you are looking for something with a bit more meat in it.

Disappointing! As soon as the game arrives, I have immediately played this game with my high expectations. After the first game, I found that the expectiation was wrong. I was very disappointed considering the reputation of game, high price, and the time I have waited for receiving the game. The game is composed of roll and move mechanics. And, that's it. The game is mearly covered by the small amount of the Witches theme. In my opinion, because of some game text on the card and the board, The Witches is not even suitable for children either. It is hard to say that the game is a family game. Moreover, the game usually takes about 2 hours to play. I don't think that children can maintain their concentration about 2 hours on a single game. Finally, I have figured it out I am going to have very little time and few chances to play this game again. From PI last year, The Witches is a serial failure designed by Martin Wallace. After my first play, I had sold away the games, both the Collector's and the normal edition. I don't know why Martin Wallace threw away his talent on designing boardgames. Still, I am expecting one day he recover his fame on boardgames.

To start, my wife loves Terry Pratchett, so she was sold on the theme alone. Add to that the game is very simple and the strategy is quite basic, and you have yourself a great game for casual players.

We play the game mostly using the co-op variant and we win probably 75% of the time. The game can be finicky on occasions, but for the most part is an enjoyable experience.

I like Terry Pratchett's weird wacko world (with drops of wisdom) and despite the simplicity of gameplay, this game plays well to it's theme. A Solid 7.

RATING: 5
The game is beautifully illustrated and the collector's edition comes with a set of fine pewter witch playing pieces. The board depicts a valley filled with Pratchettesque locations that are connected by a network of roads. The locations are partially seeded with "problems" for the witches to solve at the beginning of the game. Every turn a new problem arises, witches move to try and solve problems, and then players draw back up to their hand limit. 

Players have a hand of cards to help them, but this is a actually a dice-driven game. To solve a problem players roll two dice - potentially play cards - then roll two more dice, add the results together to match or beat a difficulty rating for the problem in their current location. The decisions mostly revolve around picking problems that you can solve based on the difficulty and what cards you have that can help you. As you solve problems you collect the tiles, which have point values that contribute to your final score. However, throughout the game as locations that already have problems are seeded with new problems, they pick up Crisis counters instead. If all the Crisis counters are out and another needs to be placed, all players lose. All players also lose if three "Elf" problems are face up on the board at any given time. So only one player wins, but all players need to work together so that everybody doesn't lose. This can lead to players who are well behind to lose motivation in solving any problems at all. A problem in and of itself.

The game is cute thanks to the art and production. The main problem is that this plays with the luck of a basic kid's game, but with the cards adding a weirdly misplaced complexity. I suspect if this game was developed by any publisher other than Treefrog, the finished product would have looked quite different, more consistently less strategic, or consistently more so.

nice little game, very simple mechanics but can be made more difficult as necessary.
Rulebook could be better though - particularly the turn order, which should be interpreted as:
- place new token
- move 
- take action if you want
- move
- take action if you want
- draw back to full hand of cards

Perhaps we had a bad game explainer, but this game just seemed awful.  The movement mechanics were uninspired, the rolling aspect was unexciting, and there were way too many problems to solve.  Our 4-player game had about 4 places that new problems could go, so we basically instantly ran out of crisis counters.  Had we been playing correctly, we would have ended the game maybe 5 minutes after starting it.  The game was not fun and we could never find where the locations were, and we had a game store owner playing as one of the group

The witches of Witchland have a number of problems to solve. More problems pop up as they go about it, but unless there's a lot of bad luck and carelessness, the game is going to dry up and time out after a while and then you count points. I like the art on the board and cards and I also somewhat like the idea of curing pigs and drinking tea, but I wasn't carried away by the gameplay, and I think several contributing factors can be identified. One is I never got a sense that I was purposely journeying about the landscape: you're either shifting your piece to a nearby location with a problem tile or spending a card to move anywhere. Another is that the procedure for solving challenges is abstract and always the same, and although the cards are thematically labelled and illustrated, most of their effects belong to generic classes. A third is that a positive feedback mechanism makes those with bad early rolls more likely to slip further behind. A fourth is that sooner or later there'll be a turn with a huge point swing because someone rolls this and someone else rolls that. If I play again I'll try leaving the elves for the leader.

Includes the Micro Art Studio colored cast resin witch figures. Imported from Poland and no longer available, these four figures (one of each witch) are a fantastic upgrade from the little wooden player cones (hats) in the game. The sculpts are better than the pewter figures that were included in the deluxe edition; they are basically the same as those figures but have much finer detail.

RATING: 7
Have played this 2 player and solo. It plays a lot more quickly than you expect and has a fairly simple system. This game is more about the journey than heavy competition and the system itself is fairly easy to beat. This is another game that falls into the bracket of move a piece, do an action on a space, move again, do another action then next players turn. Before each players turn you turn over another "problem" to be dealt with by the group. Dice rolling for dealing with problems and problems appearing in random locations gives this one a slightly heavy luck element. There are some nice little extras woven into the system and a deck of cards with excellent graphics give the whole game a warm feel. This is an entry level co-operative game (less complex than Flash-point and nowhere near as tight as 7 Days of Westerplatz) or a fun light competitive game that plays in 30 minutes.

Decent, light family game that doesn't pretend to be otherwise and we enjoy playing it cooperatively. The adults are Discworld fans and the kids love the witchy theme. Sure, the gameplay is simple but it does fit the theme and our family's tastes, especially the kids. Tad on the long side for what it is but it still gets played so it stays.
Update: Feb 2018 - one of our first board games we enjoyed cooperatively but now we have so many better coops that we prefer to play.

A cup of tea or two and an idle bit of Sunday afternoon and this is fine. The rulebook's a bit crap though and I don't know if I'd play with more than 3. Reminiscent of Talisman and Runebound.

Design, details, text all stays so very true to the work of Sir Terry Prachett. The board is wonderful to look at with so much detail to explore, little surprises for everyone. The game is easy to learn, the problem solving mechanic feels real and how the problems are placed on the board is just like looking for mushrooms in the woods, suddenly you see them everywhere!

Ouch, what is Martin Wallace doing with all his talent? I am a huge fan of most of his older games. This however, was a sad experience. Move a step to a tile, roll dice to fight the tile, move on to the next tile. Some cards added for even a littlebit of decision making, but overall a boring experience. Very simple game indeed.

Rating a bit harsh, especially since the game works just fine and we actually had fun jeering at each other while playing.  But Wallace has a rapidly diminishing reputation to hold up, and this is just another pedestrian title when he used to be an autobuy for me.  True, a guy has to make a living, but this game just had nothing special about it.  The art was very nice, I suppose, but I am not a Pratchett fan so that only went so far.  Again, nothing especially wrong with the game, but it was just there, and that was about it.  I suppose his best days are behind him, but one can still look whistfully back and hope for return to glory.

Another game to use the Discworld universe of Terry Pratchett as its thematic backdrop. 

This game is aimed at the Family market and it is quite simple in truth. 

For me that simplicity was too great and there just isn't anything challenging or interesting in the design to bring me back for more. 

The game essentially requires the players to move to locations that feature Problems and then dice must be rolled to equal or better the difficulty rating. 

There isn't too much more to it in truth. 

Ankh-Morpork is still the Discworld king by a long way.

Not familiar with Discworld series so I can only comment on the game itself. Reminded me of Elfenland, 1998 Spiele de Jahres winner - partly because of the graphic design of the board but also in aspects of gameplay. Move to different places in an other-world location and try to collect things. No real player interaction. Excellent artwork on cards and counters. The yellow-green board is a turn-off.

Players are racing around the board trying to solve problems, which is done by landing where the problem is and rolling higher than the problem's number on 4 dice, plus card effects. The higher the problem's number, the more VP's you'll get. The more "easy" problems you solve, the more cards you draw each turn. The more cards you have, the more likely you are to draw some decent effects that will allow you to solve the "hard" problems, which are naturally worth more VPs. Risky though, because there are consequences for failure - you have the choice of minimising consequences by running away after rolling the first two dice ... or you can choose to carry on, play bonus cards, then roll the final two dice and live or die by the result. My 10 year old likened it to Castle Panic ... it's not as programmed, but similarly the problems come out each turn, and you slice 'em down, keeping trouble at bay. Anyway, most VPs after 8 rounds wins (unless you all die beforehand by too many problems not being solved quick enough). Or if playing co-op, slice down enough problems so that a loss condition isn't triggered before time is called. Obviously, with 4 dice per problem, the game is hugely luck-based. It won't hold up for gamers, but that's not the market - this is for playing with family and non-gamers who love the theme, which is captured nicely through the map, the cards, and its difficulty-solving nature linking back to the Tiffany Aching books. For that, it meets the mark.

RATING: 6
"Light co-op (which can also be played solo or competitively), with a fun and charming theme. It was fun at first, but even with house rules the 2p co-op is too swingy and hard to win."

What I like:
- All the main characters are female
- Humorous, charming world
- "Having tea" with other players to get rid of dangerous cackling
- Light, but there are definitely decisions (mostly push-your-luck)

What I don't like:
- 2p co-op is too swingy and hard to win
- Role abilities are (all) extremely weak
- Setup seems just a bit fiddly
- Theoretically you could lose at the start of the first player's first turn
- Solo mode didn't impress me in my first play, but I'll try it again
- The rules above moves/actions/turns were quite unclear
- I'm surprised the board isn't a bit bigger

Originally I thought this was only a semi-cooperative game (one wins or all lose). Then I heard there was a co-op mode but it didn't work well. Then I heard it worked, but was too light (and repetitive) to be fun for gamers, and way too easy to win. All of that kept me away from the game. 

Then I heard they lost the license, so it would be going out of print. I snapped up a copy, and my wife and I enjoyed it. I would put the weight around 1.8, slightly higher than Forbidden Island, due to a bit of rules complexity.

Not a massive favourite of mine, I find this game too light but others enjoy playing it and if I can have an enjoyable game with a few people I like for an hour then that's not a bad thing. I'm most likely missing out since I've read very little Discworld stuff, although I am a fan of Wallace's other game Ankh-Morpork.

The art is nice and I must admit it's nice to use wooden dice sometimes, after you've handled plastic for so long.

RATING: 6
I wish I liked this more than I do - the artwork is fantastic and the theme is fun, but the gameplay is rather mechanical and repetitive. There's some suspense when taking on risky die rolls, and some enjoyable moments of Schadenfreude when things don't go according to plan for your opponents, but there's not a great deal of depth and (at least with 4 players) the game takes longer than it should, with a fair amount of downtime. 

I think there's also something slightly off with the game's narrative arc - the board starts off seeded with many problems and the first few turns can be tense as problems go critical all over the place, but as the game goes on the easy problems quickly get mopped up, so crises occur less and less frequently, and the last few turns just come down to who can get to the remaining difficult problems first. It feels anti-climactic.

(Opinion based only on solo and 4-player games - it may be that the balance and game duration work better for other player counts).

As it's a Martin Wallace and has the Discworld-setting I liked from Ankh-Morpork, I pre-ordered the this game. However, I think, after playing it, replay ability of this one is low. Ankh-Morpork was light, but at least you had the aspect of trying to outguess who has which character. Here, you just move and try to prevent bad things from happening, hoping on good dice rolls and good cards to hopefully correct things if things go wrong.

"Boszorkányokkal vagyunk, járjuk Lancre vidékét, és próbáljuk a problémákat megoldani, amik, hol kisebbek, hol nagyobbak. A mozgás során, ha problémába futunk meg kell állni, és meg kell próbálni megoldani. A megoldás: kocka dobás, 2+2 hatoldalú kocka, egyik oldal bolond -nullás- és a probléma nagyság számát kell megdobni. Kis problémák olyan 7-12, a nagyok 16-24 nagyságúak, plusz lehet rajtuk krízisjelző, ami még +2. 
A megoldás jól kitalálva: dob 2 kocka, eredmény láttán meg lehet futamodni -nincs következmény- vagy ki lehet játszani észszerészet vagy mágia kártyákat -ezek bónuszok a dobáshoz-, de a mágia bár +2-t ad, ad 1 bolondkorongot is. Majd a maradék 2 dobás. Ha győztünk: a lapka a mienk -van pontértéke, ezt kell gyűjteni, ezzel lehet nyerni.
Kártyák: alapban 3, és ennyi az alap kézlimit is. De ahogy egyre több könnyű problémát oldunk meg, egyre több lap lehet a kezünkbe. A nehéz problémák megoldása pedig a probléma megoldó képességünk növeli: magyarul +1-t kapunk a dobásunkhoz.
Aztán a kártyáknak vannak képességeik is, és azokat is használhatjuk, ezek mindenféle jó dolgok, pl. bolondkorong eldobások, ne gyűljön, vagy kocka újradobás, vagy láthatatlanság, és átmehetünk problémás helyen, stb....
Ha nem sikerül a problémát megoldani: kriziskorong rá, +2 nehezítés. A nehéz problémáknál, a probléma függvényében más negatívumok is lehetnek.
A másik lépés eredmény: ha olyan helyre lépünk, ahol másik boszi áll: leülnek teázni, 3 ill. 2 bolondkorongot el lehet dobni.
És mint az elején írtam: ez a mozgás+megálló hely függvényű akciót 2x kell eljátszani a körünkben.
Majd a végén a lapjaink kézlimitre töltjük.
Játék vége: ha a problématalonból az utolsó is felkerül. Az nyer, akinek a legtöbb pontja van a problémák megoldásából.
Viszont lehet veszteni is a játék ellen: ha 3 tündér látszik van fent képpel felfelé a táblán, mint probléma vagy ha kriziskorongot kéne feltenni a táblára és nincs. Ez utóbbi ugyanis nem csak akkor kerül fel, ha nem sikerül megoldani egy problémát, hanem minden játékos minden köre előtt van egy probléma felpakolás, ami úgy zajlik, h addig húzunk lapokat, míg olyan nem jön fel, ahol nincs probléma, akkor odatesszük a problémát. Az addig felhúzott problémás helyekre viszont kriziskorongot teszünk fel.... na ebbe buktunk bele 2x :-)
Amúgy jól adja a világ hangulatát, mind képileg, mind szellemileg: a boszorkáknak össze is kell fogniuk, h ne legyen túl nagy a krizis, de mindenki a saját pecsenyéjét sütögeti azért, mert mégis csak boszik vagyunk, vagy mi."

If you want to play with first timers or young children it's OK...but heavier gamers can be bored ...

Disclaimer: rated as a gateway and family game!

Now this is very different to "Ankh-Morpork" - aside from the theme, the two games have very little in common. This one is a family and gateway game with simple rules and two play modes: competitive and cooperative. It's random (dice!) but in my opinion there are some interesting and often crucial decisions. Still, if the dice gods are against you... not much can be done. But you roll so often luck evens out most of the time.

I always have great fun with "Witches", but you really need to risk it. Playing it safe can and will be boring. Also, remember to put on your witch hat! (And chill out, without expecting anything deep or strategic or whatever.) Plus, it's super beautiful.

+looks nice
+strong theme

-HUGE disapointment if you played Ankh-Morpork before, 
-way to easy with way to many convoluted rules for this level of gameplay
-gameplay itself is just stupid, strongly snowballing random effects of early ations make this game resolved way to soon
-"special" actions of witches do NOTHING
-"problems" are not a challenge to solve
-there is not too many different cards
-even this theme (the Witches) is the worst one from Terry Pratchett's Disc World series

This is a pretty simple game that is a card influenced simplified Runebound type game.   You roam the area battling/solving problems.  However, instead of having a final battle, you have to mitigate various problems that can make you lose prematurely.  Pretty fun game however, i just wish the theme was more immersed.   I just felt like I was looking for more.  That being said, as a solo its a pretty good quick easy to set game that could be played over numerous times in a night.  The rating could definitely go up as I figure this game out more.

RATING: 4
My wife ordered this game (the deluxe edition, or whatever it is called), as she is a sucker for anything Discworld related (I'm a Pratchett fan too, although I haven't read most of the more recent books), and is also something of a completionist, and we have the Ankh-Morpork game in the same series. Anyway, we played our first game in September 2013. It did not go down well at all - we had missed the rule that you get to attempt 2 problems per turn, which meant that we soon collectively lost through problems coming out quicker than we could solve them.

We replayed in March 2016, with the correct rules - and then it seemed like a perfectly playable little game. But still really really unimpressive - there's just nothing here that hasn't been done much better, or in a more interesting way, in countless other games. And, quite unlike Wallace's Ankh-Morpork game, there is absolutely not Discworld flavour here at all - the cards bear no relation to the characters depicted. There's nothing wrong with this game, but I won't ever choose to play it.

RATING: 5.5
Nothing close to Ankh-Morpork but still some fun even though it's extremely light. Do enjoy the press your luck aspect with dice rolling. Nice components and art. Hard to believe this is a Wallace game.

The game fits the story. Is that a good thing? Well, yes and no. It features all different aspects of being a witch on the Discworld really well and the game works for what is is; 'all' mechanics fit nicely together and the game is a perfect translation of the every day happenings in the books about Tiffany. However, the stories about Tiffany are the lighter books in the Discworld series and so is this game. It's a really light and easy game. Probably one of the first games I'll teach my little nephew as soon as his English is up to it.

It's difficult to rate this one, as the game "in the box" is a little on the easy side - which is extremely acceptable for a game pitched squarely at the family market.  
However, what I like about it is the flexibility of the system - there are several variables which can be tweaked easily to create a game that can evolve in difficulty according to the group without breaking instantly (similar to Knizia's Lord of the Rings game.)
That earns it a spot in my collection.  (And that's quite apart from the strong thematic feeling of the cards and mechanics, which I expected after Ankh-Morpork.  Any Pratchett fan should enjoy that aspect at least.)

Очень простая игра. Слишком много бросков кубиков, от которых всё и зависит. Иной раз можно поиграть под настроение, но не более того. Небольшая параллель с Анк-Морпорком есть, но только в части скоротечности использования карт.

I have been playing the Solo variant to try and get the rules straight.

[thing=137095][/thing] is a pretty easy game to learn and play - you basically just have four things to do: move and either stop for a tea with another witch, deal with a problem or do nothing. A witch can't pass by a problem without at least trying to solve it (it is the job) or a witch without stopping for tea (it is the etiquette). There are two types of problems: easy and hard ones - they are put in the board at the start of every player turn by flipping a card from the deck and putting a problem in the place named in the card (if there is already a problem in that space, a crisis token is put, making the problem harder - +2 - to be dealt with, then a new card is revealed, and goes like this until a problem is put in an empty place on the board, which can mean that several crisis tokens can be put in sequence). The more easy ones you deal with, more cards you can have in hand (for every two problems, one more card). The more hard ones you dealt with, more bonuses you have to handle problems (+1 for every two hard problems). Hard problems are worth more points, but the consequences for failing in handling them are steeper and are different depending on the problem - failing an easy problem only makes a witch to flee to an adjacent location and take one cackle token.

You can use cards for several effects, but mostly revolve in dealing with the problems - reroll, add bonus, taking more cards. Dealing with problems is like this: you first roll two d6. Then you can add cards with the headalogy symbol for +1 bonus and/or cards with the magic symbol for +2 bonus (but you also take one cackle token for each magic card used this way). Then you roll more two d6. You add the value of the four dice and the bonus to see if the witch beat the number required by the problem. If the amount was equal or more, the problem was solved and the player takes the token of the problem and put in his player board. If it didn't, the witch failed and must flee and suffer the consequence (one cackle token + an extra effect if it is a hard problem).

In the competitive mode the game ends after the last problem is put in the board and the current player finishes his turn. Players add their points and the one with the highest amount wins the game. In the cooperative mode, the game ends in the same way, and the players win if there are less than 4 hards problems in the board once the game finishes. However, in both modes, all the players can lose if some conditions are met: if the crisis tokens end or if there are three or more problems with Elves revealed at the same time (Elves are a plague in Lancre it seems!). In the cooperative, the game also ends if the Black Aliss tokens end (you take one of them when you have too much cackle tokens - you need to stop for a tea to not turn into a bad witch!).

Even with all the bonuses one cad have to deal with a problem, it is still mostly, in several cases, a luck affair. Roll high number and you can solve even the hardest problems without requiring many cards. Roll low and you will most likely fail. If you are luck enough to take three different Power of the Three cards, you can solve a problem without rolling dice, which can mean some nice points. There is also luck with the cards taken (there some better than others), in the places the problems appear and which one are they - for instance, in one play, a player had the witch that can solve a Sick Pig problem without rolling, but she wasn't able to find one when it was her turn (but the Broom symbol on the cards, that allow a witch to go anywhere on the board, really help here).

Overall, [thing=137095][/thing] is a really light game, most definitely aimed towards family nights plays instead of game nights with other gamers, both in the competitive and cooperative mode - as in the competitive any player, regardless of skill level, can win with some lucky rolls; and the cooperative mode can give some challenge to the players, but isn't exceptionally hard (there are ways to make it harder, though). Also, [thing=137095][/thing] isn't a "take that" or a "bash the leader" kind of game - there is no way to really hurt anyone else, except claiming problems that other could solve. So, yes, you can have a runaway leader, even more because a player that is doing well has more chances to continue doing well, since he gains more cards and bonuses. It is also important to say that the gameplay is, as you might noticed, mostly a multiplayer-solitaire: you do your thing, I do mine, and we meet in the end to compare points. Yes, to sip a tea you need another witch, but this other one doesn't have to actually do anything, nor it can prevent you from being at the table at tea time (witches are to polite to do that).

As expected, [b]the artwork is amazing[/b]. The board is a work of art that I could put in a frame and in my living room.

Not a real winner for my tastes, but I would surely be willing to play the cooperative mode every once in a while (the competitive mode, due to the amount of luck and runaway leader, seems way worst to me), as it plays in a short amount of time (around 1 hour) and is a good option to put in the table when presenting a game to newbies or kids (or to close a night of games, when you just can't think anymore but still want to play a little more). It is a lighter game than [thing=91312][/thing] and also a weaker game. But is still Discworld!

This is a great game if you can keep your brain on a tween level.  Your little Witch travels around the county side by foot and broom solving minor problems like sick pigs, pregnancy, and death.  Eventually they graduate to confrontations with the likes of Elves and Vampires.  The Witches must be wary as they risk a cackle effect that would turn them into hideous Crones.  But in the end much of this worry can be taken care of by stopping for some tea with a fellow witch.

RATING: 5
Genuinely disappointed. We'd been looking at this for a while and nearly bought it a couple of times and particularly because of the martin Wallace moniker on there. But we played it during open gaming at UKGE14 and honestly, I really really hope we missed something big in the rules because otherwise there was little that really engaged us at all about this game. The artwork is great and very funny and would appeal to Pratchett fans immensely (i'm a casual Pratchetter) but beyond that? There just doesn't seem to be much there and before you know it, you run out of a token and bam, apparently that's the end of the game. There's little sense of build-up or progress or anything really to hang your hat on and say "Yeah, we achieved something there" I was a bit quiet about it and then my partner turned round at the end and went 'is that it?' and so it rang alarm bells that it wasn't just me. I'd be prepared to give it another go with someone who loves it and give it the chance to shine, but as it is, i'm glad we've never taken that plunge and bought it on a flyer.

This game was fine.  I'm not big on co-ops, but I think this game works better as one than competitive.  The competitive mode just puts you in a co-op situation where everyone has to make selfish decisions to "win".  The flip side is that the true co-op mode is going to be much harder as it introduces more ways to lose.

I've never been much on the whole idea of playing a co-op game 10 times until you finally win.  It's not something that enjoy.

We are trainee witches trying to earn our brooms by traveling the area of Lancre to semi-cooperatively or competitively resolve encounters. These are in the form of simple and difficult problems tiles using dice rolling modified by card play while trying to avoid generating cackle counters. Solving problems gives wizards a boost to card size and dice. We lose if the crisis tokens are depleted or if three elf tiles are face up on the board. Modified luck-based, family game.

PL: ruch, rzut kością, odrobina układania kart na ręce i szacowania ryzyka... Piękne wydanie. Niestety brak pratchettowego klimatu (poza piękną grafiką i nazwami)

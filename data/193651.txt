RATING: 9
This is one of the best games I played this year The simplicity of the implementation and the fact that for a dice game with a lot of luck it feels all the time that you're in control and that every decision matters... all of it makes this game great. Plan to buy asap.

Probably a good family game but only an ok gamer game.
Can outlast its welcome when the game drags out too long.

Short, fast game with a big replayability. Easy to learn, not very tactical but very nice as a family game.

[thing=193651][/thing] is a dice-based game where you put down your pawns into the Bohemian villages to occupy buildings which will give you points in various ways and/or at different times during the game.
It is somewhat interesting to try the various routes to generate points, even more so because you can push other player's pawns out of some buildings, thus interfering with their plans.

However, the game feels quite shallow with nothing to relate to – I think that another setting, gangsters/mob running their business in districts of a city or just something in space (e.g. colonising planets), would have worked better.

Furthermore the game end is really quirky and took us longer than needed. 
But let me explain.
The game ends when a player starts his turn with no pawns left. This combined with the ability to push out enemy pawns back to their owner's hands led to the situation that our last 5 to 6 rounds consisted of just putting my pawn down in a way that the next player will receive a pawn back. Rinse and repeat.
This end-game alone further dwarfed our enthusiasm for another play.
Although I could see myself playing another round in the future, I most likely would need to be persuaded a bit.

It plays solidly but it just didn't catch the interest of the people I played it with. It was also hard to spot the features on the tiles on less than perfect lighting as numbers and icons weren't big and blended into the background.

Initial Impressions:
------------------------
Was kind of excited for this one, due to seeming to have a cool dice mechanism along with some area control elements.  The game overall does have some interesting ideas, but there is too much bad stuff in this one to allow for the cool stuff to shine.  The game drags on, and really takes a unique group who won't try to drag the game on, which really doesn't make sense, since you should try to drag it on if you are not winning.  The tiles look cool, but the graphic design makes it REALLY tough to locate where everything is, which just slows the game down even more, and causes error in counting money, and what is available to be bumped.  Could of been cool, but epic fail here.

Lovely little system. A nice worker placement dice chucker that uses different scoring mechanisms with a bit of spatial reasoning thrown in. Won't rock your world, but it works fairly well, has great art and is a solid family or filler game. Pretty sure this system will be reused in a heavier game in the future. Well done.

+ Clever mechanisms
+ Simple, elegant, easy to teach and play
+ The opportunity/threat to end the game is really fun
+ Beautiful art

= Lots of luck of the dice, non-easily mitigate-able

- Limited replayability, not much to see here after 2-3 plays

Due to the (different) design of each village, it is really hard to keep overview as the game is mostly about majorities. After Orléans of the same designer I had higher hopes for this just average game. That it is prone to kingmaking is no advantage either.

Not a bad dice chucker, sort of reminiscent of Can't stop, only with added scoring opportunities.

Somewhat clever game of rolling dice, placing meeples, attacking the other players, and scoring points in a dozen different ways. Nothing really stands out, though.

The endgame seemed borderline broken though, and I see no reason why it wouldn't degenerate into a vicious beat-up-on-the-others cycle.

Bought on impulse, entirely because it's by the designer of Orleans, one of my favourite recent Euros.
Neat, simple game, mostly fun. There'a a bit too much downtime with 5 players, and one game got badly bogged down in the endgame when everyone just kept extending the game by kicking each other out of buildings 2-5 over and over again.

I like the first 2/3 of the game, but the ending is imho stupid. At the end everybody will simply kick-out the player who hasn't any workers left, which makes the game simply drags on until someone has an unlucky dice roll, can't kick-out that player and the game ends.

Dice game! I actually quite liked this area control dice game. 4 dice splitting into 2 numbers like can't stop but you are claiming locations and trying to take control of different buildings for bonuses. The boards are very unclear and it is difficult to play the game because the artwork is challenging to see. I liked it, but I think the art work needed to be more clear and the player aids also needed to be more clear.

Harmless 30-40min dice game. Few clever bits but there is a potential that ending could drag abit if everyone focused on kicking others off. The rules on kicking could be made simpler or at least mentioned in the player aides. Don't know how they didn't do that. Anyway pretty nice lunch time game but no more.

tl;dr: one of those games that has nothing wrong with it but doesn't have much going for it either

My rather long tl;dr more or less sums up my thoughts on this game. There's absolutely nothing wrong with this game, I just found it so been-there-done-that and unspectacular that I couldn't get really excited.
But it plays pretty well and doesn't take very long, so playing it is not going to upset many people either.
It's just one of those games that I wouldn't have sunk money into either as a consumer or as a publisher. It's just not special enough.

The luck factor doesn't bother me but at least 50% of decisions in the game involves kingmaking/bash the leader. Some of the actions are useless until endgame so if you roll low it's basically wasted until then and the game is far too long. Piece of annoying shit. Feels like someone made a bet with the designer if he can make Can't Stop (which I love) into a eurogame in 5 minutes while drunk.

Bohemian Villages 2016 issue #6, is the worst review Spielbox has published. Codswallop about lacking in strategy due to luck dependency. Misrepresented rules for farms. Even some drivel about the game's title! Outstanding light filler from same designer as Orléans. Best dice based title available to teach action selection with at gateway level. Enjoyable for players at other levels.

I had fun with it, but it seems like it would have made the game incredibly easier to play to make the information more prominent on the good-looking tiles. There's a little of active fighting for dominance in this or that, but it's overall pleasant if everyone can do it in good fun.

Good filler game than can be played reasonably quickly. Nothing stunning or particularly new, but it's a good little dice game - just have to watch that the end game doesn't drag on a bit.

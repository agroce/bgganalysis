A great Quoridor inspired (?) game.  Too bad it hasn't gained any traction and is an obscure game that no one has heard of.

RATING: 7
After coming across Entrapment by accident on a geeklist and then finding out you can play it on boardspace.net I feel I’ve stumbled upon a gem. Bearing in mind I’m only about 10 plays into my Entrapment career these are my early thoughts.

Entrapment has come in soundly as my third favourite ‘abstract’ only being topped by the two timeless giants Chess and Go. Two contenders for my third place spot were Quoridor and Yinsh but I feel this quite easily has the edge over both of these games in fun and depth. It is as if all four of these games were combined and then out popped ‘Entrapment’. 

The ‘start’ game feels tense as the players are jockeying for position, looking to put the opponent on the back foot. With every attacking and defensive placement of barriers, territories are slowly being defined. This must be kept in mind while attacking your opponents Roamers and defending your own, as you must also consider how your Roamers are positioned on the grand scheme of things. Like the old saying goes ‘you may win the battle but lose the war’ quite easily in Entrapment. 

These early territories and loose borders become ever more rigid as the game progresses. One wrong move and your opponent could quite easily force one of your Roamers into a territory which he doesn’t want to be in. The next thing you know you’ve been walled in and are frantically double moving your Roamer to try and escape the death grip of your opponent. You will quickly realise barriers can be used for defensive purposes also, leaving Roamers a much needed one time use escape route.  You may only jump each one of your own barriers once before they become permanent un-jumpable fixtures on the board. By placing the barriers and entering Roamers into different walled regions of the board, players are writing a rough script for the endgame. The script isn’t necessarily set in stone though until the very final stages as once your store of barriers has ran out, your un-jumped fences already placed on the board can then be re-placed. This again opens up options for clever calculating play down the home stretch.

For fans of abstracts there are loads of options for interesting plays and so many avenues to pursue it will just keep you coming back for more. Juggling attack and defence with positioning while keeping in mind the endgame is such a terrific ever evolving puzzle.

Cool abstract strategy game!

The look of it is extremely dry (simple, boring blocks for pawns and fences), which is the biggest caveat. The designer of the game could have tried to spice things up, like what was done in hive (pictures of bugs).

Similar feel to Quaridors, the rules are very straightforward. My five year old daughter picked the basics up straight away. The strategy runs alot deeper.

Set to become a favourite filler. A lovely offering.

RATING: 9.5
Update: Up another .5 to 9.5 because of the great times my son and I are having together with this game. My first rating was 8 ... then 9.... now 9.5.

I've played this more than a few times now and I'm only just starting to see the enormous possibilities this game can offer.  

I really enjoy the hunt and/or be hunted feel that this game offers.  The careful to and fro between the two opponents each waiting for the best time to launch an attack or make a retreat is a real joy to experience.

Like all the best abstracts this feels like it is not a game you can master overnight.  With many euros, after 50 plays you'd be very well versed in how to play and play well... i suspect that after 50, or even 100, plays of this I'll still be a mere beginner.  In this regard I feel it is a game a person can grow with, it has "meat" and i'm certain it will have staying power and I'll still be playing this a long time after this post has been made.

I also feel it is a game you can play fast and loose for a bit of fun.. or you can play with long term planning and strategic thinking.  So it offers both the casual player and the hardcore abstracts geek something to get stuck into.

My oldest child (aged 8) also likes the look of the game and has been trying to offer advice while I've played on boardspace.net.  He like the "maze" look the board produces towards the end of the game and ... well ... many kids like a good maze.  

If you survive long enough to place all your barriers, this endgame maze doesn't downgrade the game for adults .. it's not a simple kids maze.. it has been carefully put in place earlier in the game by the thoughtful placement of walls to allow you paths to escape while blocking your opponent.

I am very much looking forward to continue playing this game with my family and friends. It's a quality game and offers a lot of replayability and depth. 

EDIT: I've now bought my own Entrapment board and love the look of it.  Great quality and great fun.

Got "re-aquinted" with this at boardspace.net. Really a quite excellent abstract on par with GIPF series.

Sounds interesting. I may be willing to trade for a copy.

At first it felt like a game of chase, but as we got better it became a lot deeper (watch the previously played games on boardspace.net to see examples of good play). Now we love it. Great game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Not as intuitive as I usually prefer my abstracts to be (it takes several plays to get a feel for what you should be doing), and I imagine it'll be a bit rough to explain to new players.  This is definitely a nut worth cracking though, because the game clearly has great depth, and things can become wonderfully suspenseful once the walls start closing in.  

There's a lot of room for clever play here, and the whole experience has a very Go-like feel of interconnectedness between offense and defense.  While attacking, you have to remember that you're also boxing yourself in to a certain extent, so it behooves you to keep an eye toward building escape routes for yourself to use later on. 

Since I'm a huge fan of Quaridor, I'll make the obligatory comparison;  Entrapment feels like playing Quoridor while trapped inside a second, larger game of Quaridor.  Kinda... 

UPDATE: I like the game so much that I ordered a physical copy, and I'm glad I did.  The components are top rate.  Nice thick board and super chunky bits.

I discovered Entrapment on boardspace.net - (Thank you Dave Dyer!) It is a meaty game with a lot of replay value. I recommend this for anyone who is looking for a new abstract.

RATING: 9.3
A capture/immobilisation game of considerable interest and novelty, Entrapment is to Quoridor what Chess is to Checkers! Rich Gowell has created an epic abstract that has real depth. A beginner will feel confident until trounced by a tactic they had not yet considered. As skill increases, players are rewarded not only with new insights but with new mechanisms available only in the extreme endgame. This is a true battle of wills, prepare to be choked to death slowly and excruciatingly.

initial rating only

A pretty neat little game, might go on a tad long for what it is but still another decent little abstract with a bit of cat and mouse going on. 

Judging by the comments so far it looks like I will need to give this more play as with many abstracts the more you play the more it reveals itself and likely here too.

Unfortunately not as nice as Quoridor which is very similar. Great game though. There are some counterintuitive elements to wall placement and attacking too aggressively can get you into trouble.

RATING: 7
Cool abstract that doesn't feel like an abstract, but more like an arena combat to the most vicious death. It isn't really similar to Blockade/Quoridor as the goals here are tactically to capture opposing pieces and strategically to create safe moves for your own pieces.

The designer of this game just taught me how to play on boardspace.net
The fact that you can use your own walls to your advantage AND your opponents disadvantage makes this game unique and interesting.

I usually don't like abstract games, but this is a game I really liked. It is deep, tactical and strategic, offering a much meatier gaming experience than quoridor 

best of all, I've been taught but the designer Rich Gowell himself :>

RATING: 8.5
Early rating, but one that I can't see doing anything but rise as I get to feel more in control of events. Have so far played a handful of times on BoardSpace against the game's designer, and am increasingly impressed. It's a textbook example of how the depth of the best games can reveal itself long before you acquire mastery, or even competence, in the art of navigation. The killer rule here is the ability of pieces to jump friendly barriers once and once only.

I have really enjoyed the lunchtime plays of this fantastic little two player abstract. The game is very well produced and very challenging offering multiple strategies for achieve victory or, in my case, regular defeat.

Rather than me blather on about how great this game is, have a look at my regular gaming chum’s review of this little gem here: 

Block, corral, capture and kill

I don’t own this game (yet) but will consider purchasing and am unlikely to refuse an opportunity to play.

Interesting gameplay. There's a great battle for position happenning in the board all the time. I can't grasp the strategic scope yet, so for now I'll say it has a very high tactical nature.

I had never heard of this game before until I found out Boardspace.net had implemented it. I tried it there and loved it. I, of course, have heard of, played, and really liked Quoridor (which this on the surface seems to be similar to), but Entrapment seems to be a bit meatier.

Update 06/15/2011:
Addicted, enthralled, and enticed. Yup, it's that good!

There are 5 rules, of which one of them is a bit tough.
The game offers so much tactical and strategic planning. Just awesome.

First, thanks to those who've taken the time to rate the game and offer their insights into its play. In particular, thanks to Quinn Swanger, Frank LaMar, Paul Murray, and Calvin Daniels for their wonderful formal reviews, and to Bennett Gardiner for his cool "arena battle" rendition of the game.  Much appreciated.

Second, a big thanks to Dave Dyer for adding Entrapment to the group of abstracts lucky enough to find a home on his 
amazing creation, Boardspace.net.

Lastly, I just want to encourage new players to keep at it.  The game has layers of depth which do not reveal themselves immediately, and the quality of gameplay increases very significantly only as they do.  It helps to have an experienced player to show the way.  Any one who would like to meet up on boardspace for a more "human" introduction to the game, please feel free to geekmail me.  I very much enjoy teaching it.

I normally don't go for 2 player abstracts but this one is great.  It involves a lot of heuristic reasoning (vs. straight computation), and thus appeals to my euro-gamer sensibilities.

The wood board and pieces make it heirloom quality, and the play has tons of depth to explore. A classic indeed.

RATING: 7
I like the basic concept of the game. But just like chess there is too much movement going on for me. I have a hard time reading the board because of all the movement possibilities. I prefer games like Go, which is even deeper, but where the pieces do not move once they are placed.

I think that the whole "passing through walls once" thing is clever but too hard for me. :)

RATING: 10
Few more game easily lead this game to a 10!

If you're in doubt that this game deserve a 10, go play it to see by yourself... and if by playing it you don't finally give this game a 10, you need to play some more games to see how awesome it is and finally give Entrapment his deserved 10.

Twisted situations arise on the board!! 

I'm not a great GO player but this game remind me some layers of Go. If you play Go, i think you'll understand.

Please, if you like abstract give this gem a chance, it really deserve it, sincerly!

(1st rating= 9.5)

What a game!!... not many games played now, about 7-8, but i already know that's a gem by many interesting situation we're facing in our games... my girlfriend and my friend have great words about it too. We're having interesting post-game discussion. Rating can reach 10 if it keep me on the same way that i see it growing for now. But can be lowered too if not.

...and just want to add some "story"...

This game intrigued me since about one year, i readed the rules and also great interesting comments here by persons who also own some games that i already like...

My feeling was that this game's surely great, but does it have what i'm searching for when playing an abstract??

Never tried the game before some days ago because, thinking that's this game is surely great, i want to try it face-to-face with one of my gaming friend who appreciate abstract too, it give more taste to take a good start on a game for me... keeping the online play for later...

I've seen that Rich, the game designer is active here and also do custom handmade board... looked at them, they seems great simple looking games, just what needed to gently satisfy the eyes!

So i want to "encourage" an active abstract author here on BGG and i ordered a custom board even if i never played the game... i trusted my spider sense on that is a great game...

Our first 2 games where really interesting, but at the third and other ones we're really having a blast!!

That's my hot game right now can't stop thinking of it!!

Entrapment meet my expectation.

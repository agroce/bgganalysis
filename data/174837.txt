I have played this at Guardian Games a few times now with Ryan and it's always been really fun and an interesting challenge. The mix of cooperation and self-preservation is really cool. I love how you use other people's stations and bridges to get what you need. But they can do it to you as well!

A long waited game, missed out the kickstarter in 2016 and then grabbed a copy when I am in Essen SPIEL 2017.

We played like 30-50% wrong (2-3 rules however they affect the entire gameplay and strategy) but I do really like the game and enjoyed how we do those stuff.

The game's component is good, solid and nice. The game card quality is there and the board is surely nice. I would say the gamebox is smaller than usual 30x30cm gamebox has pros and cons. 

You basically have to plan out a strategy to plot for best scoring before 14 flare cards placed out. The location of you building gates, foundry, tower and nodes are essentially important so that other people can use your stuff and you get energy cubes for free.

Would love to play it again anytime soon in a correct rules!

This game is strange, but very enjoyable. The core game play mechanism feels mostly abstract. You repeatedly move a few small pieces around the board to create patterns or to occupy certain positions. But, similar to Tash Kalar, its crafted in a way where the theme pokes through in spots. From there, this game exhibits lots of interesting aspects, with some depending on what mix of instability cards are present. There's a very good depth of game play to rule set ratio; there's positive interaction between players; there's potential for aggressive interaction between players; and there's an ability to control the game's pace in a way that feels different from other games. Further, the instability cards provide a good dose of meaningful variation between each play. Playing well requires a plan that takes into account a wide spectrum of strategic considerations, from short-term decisions (e.g., what's my plan for this set of sun divers), to medium term decisions (e.g., what station/gate does my opponent need and where can I place it where it'll get used to my benefit), and all the way to long term strategy (e.g., how heavy to push the pace).

Very good design with interesting mechanics.  The theme with it's art and excellent components presents itself with genuine verve. At odds with this is the actual gameplay which feels dry and abstract. The game looks good, but while it tries hard to tell an exciting story, and I applaud it for this, it doesn't feel that way at all.  It plays out as a very good strategy game.  I'd definitely enjoy it more as a themeless design.  That way the beauty of the design would be easier to perceive and enjoy.

A puzzly abstract game at heart. Hamster on a wheel. Then BAM!, the game ends.

It is original, and not anything comparable.

Dropped from 7.5 to 4.
Very boring engine to start. Use a ship to generate an energy, then use energy to build more ships.

+1 to the rating for superb components.

A stunning game concept with truly unique mechanics! Combinatorial board setup makes each game fresh.

Played this at KublaCon where it got second in the game design competition. The only thing holding it back were rules that needed a bit more polish, which seems to have happened in the half year since I played it. As a game designer I have seen hundreds of games in development, and this is the one I am most excited about.

Admittedly this is after only a first play, but I really have no desire to go back to this one.  The whole game is a rudimentary construct-convert-score-repeat scenario that is interesting only because of the tempo involved.  And the tempo of this game is WEIRD.  

The length of the game is determined by a deck of cards, and doing things deeper in the sun gets you more cards, hence speeds the game along.  You can durdle in outer orbit, making small gains, but not advancing the game, or you can dive deep for big rewards and speed the game along.

The problem is that it is completely unintuitive which method is the best, and it also depends on what the other players are doing.  Why is that?

Well, because of the other defining element of this game: using other players' structures gives them a bonus.  Why would I ever want to do that?  Well, I guess it is because the time it takes for me to build my own, move my divers into position, and then use it would be too long, given the tempo of the game.  So when is that a good call?  It is very opaque.  

What ended up happening is that we did our own thing, diving deep to the core and building a transmission tower (energy -> momentum, basically cubes into points).  Indeed, we each built one of each structure to use.  We never used each others, because why would I give them points?  I guess there's a chance that I could use it when they didn't have the required energy or w/e, but that takes a lot of planning to make it work just right.  And if it isn't just right, the tempo is all out of whack.

So we each did our own thing, but I did it faster because of an instability card I drew that let me make twice as many divers.  

Look, I'm sure there's tremendous depth here, and that seasoned players could easily discern the tempo of the game and make the optimal strategy, but figuring that out is too challenging for a game this opaque.

If I want a game where we can use each others' stuff and we have to work together, kinda, I would go with Via Nebula or Concordia or Caylus or New Bedford over this.

RATING: 7.5
A very beautiful game that plays well solo or with a group.  There are even rules for co-op play.  |Some of the best looking components that I have come across in a long time.  The mechanics are pretty easy to grasp, but take planning and strategy to master.  Lots of variables and the right amount of randomness to keep the replay-ability high.  The rules seem to scale well regardless of the number of players.

My only real complaint is that the score tracker board seemed a little flimsy at first, but it serves its purpose.  It is the one component that seems lacking in quality when compared to everything else.  It is not that it is poorly made, just thinner than I was expecting and everything else is of such high quality that it makes it feel lower than it really is.  I will be curious to see how well it holds up over time.  everything else about the game is great so far.  The box is quite a bit smaller than I was expecting for the amount of components that are inside.  The included baggies for sorting out the components are a nice bonus and make setup and tear down much faster as well as keep the box organized.

RATING: 9
Tentative rating of an 8 after one 2P learning play. I think the game will shine with a more crowded board as you jockey for position and use each other's stuff. Turns are super quick as you only do one thing, which is nice. 

The fun of the game is chaining your actions together more efficiently than your opponents. The variety in action planning comes from a randomly chosen set of bonus actions available each game. There's a way for you to get one bonus card at a time that corresponds to one of the bonus actions. So you plan out what you want to do next (like build a station or activate all stations of one type) and which bonus card you think will help you in this mini-action cycle you're pursuing. 

You can use opponents' stuff such that you don't have to build everything you need but rather leech off them. They'll get a bonus when you use their stuff but so what. So you look at the board in very practical terms of what stuff -- yours and others' -- can you use most effectively and what do you yourself need to build and which bonus card will help you with your immediate goal? 

I like that there is player interaction and this isn't another "personal player board planning" type of solitairish euro.  Spaces can only have one station apiece, so you might race to build first, and you can very easily take advantage of opponents' stuff to further your own goals. So you're very much engaged on their turns to see what they're building or planning to build (you can anticipate what they'll build by how they position their pieces).

Will update this comment after I play a game with more people, but as a fan of action puzzle games, I'm intrigued.

UPDATE: OK, my second play was a 5P and I'm taking the rating from an 8 to a 9. Great game for the reasons I mentioned above. You're constantly engaged with what other people are doing, creatively apply bonus cards, and turns are super quick. I said at one point that I can't think of another game where turns go as quickly as this yet is still as thinky. A winner in my book and an antidote to the solitarish resource conversion games that dominate the hobby.

I'm really kicking myself on backing Scythe instead of Sol. Sol has a fairly simple rule set but a lot goes into planning well and being strategic. Your ship will move frustratingly slow at times and too fast at others. While others activate your structures giving you a bonus, you might need to do likewise and take advantage of theirs. All the while instability cards allow you to break the rules of the game while moving the sun inexorably closer to going super nova. It's a beautiful game that has depth and player interaction. Need a copy!

I'll start this out at a 7.5 because I recognize this is a good game, I just don't know what to make of it given how poorly we all played. You simply HAVE to piggyback on what your other players have done and if you don't you won't have enough time to do anything of consequence, PERIOD. None of us recognized this until it was too late and our scores were abysmally low. I would like to play it again and I think the rating could go higher, much higher. It doesn't have a lot of rules, but what rules it has are a bit tough to grok. Little things like your mother ship moving counter clockwise while turn order moves clockwise was messing me up, among other things. Need to play this again to solidify a rating.

Interesting game to wrap my head around. You really have to plan ahead, both because placement of your Sundivers matters to convert into stations, because you can only do one action per turn, and your mothership is constantly rotating around, changing where you're deploying.

Right now I'm probably at a 7.5, but want to play it more before deciding up or down.

A bit abstract at first, but after an initial play through it all becomes second nature.  A great puzzler with quality components that rewards a bit of forward thinking, plays fantastic with a group, and even comes with solo play mode scenarios that are a blast to suss out.  This game is a hidden gem that demands table time, and looks like a work of art at the end of play.

RATING: 9.5
Sol is unique and excellent.  The mechanics are simple and abstract yet brilliantly integrated with the theme, like a cross between Knizia and Chvatíl.  The downtime feels low because each player's turn is relatively short.  Each game plays with a subset of public "special powers" which adds a nice variety, but the gameplay which emerges from the simple rule set is the real reason to keep coming back for more.  The production quality is superb.  The graphic design and rule book are up there with the best.  An extremely impressive debut by the Spangler brothers!

I played a late prototype version at Gamestorm 2016 and found it to be a unique, compelling design. I particularly enjoyed the constant orbit of your ship around the sun (very thematic) and its implications on the timing of your actions. 

Also great was the variable set of cards used in each game, allowing groups to decide in advance if they want high interaction/conflict or a more indirect, "euro" feel. This brings replayability (and the potential for a pre-game draft variant, if players are so inclined).

I'm looking forward to seeing the final version!

We really enjoy abstracts and clean rules so this is exactly the kind of game that works for us. Living up to my high expectations so far. Rating for the two player game (3 games in, plus one learning game to figure the rules out). I'm really looking forward to more plays of this.

A word  about the theme: My daughter read the mythos book and was excited to learn to play.  Unfortunately, as soon as we pulled the pieces out, she burst into tears because she's worried about her sun-divers and their imminent death! We'll try again tomorrow. She says her green world isn't scared of death so she almost wants to try and save a different world :-D

"Yeah, Sol: Last Days of a Star is a hell of a game. It's probably one of my favorite games of 2017, and I'm consistently bummed that I haven't played it as much as I would like. It's a beautiful game with an incredible theme, and every time I play it I want to play it again. I love the weird juxtaposition of the peaceful nature of silently orbiting a dying star with the intense dread that comes with the knowledge that the game can end at any time, and Sol is nothing if not a game that manages to deftly marry these conflicting ideals into a superior product. One thing that particularly astounds me is that this is the first game published by Elephant Laboratories, which, is ... super impressive? Like it's genuinely a hell of a game. This is definitely a game you should check out if you love a really cool thematic experience but also want to combine that with frankly ... stellar (pun intended) gameplay. This is an easy add to my Top 15 and I'd highly recommend it to everyone. The only thing I really need for it now is a killer soundtrack."

Moved from 7->8 after second play. Still playing poorly. We missed one of the 13 red cards meaning we went to the end of the deck in our second play. Did not play with the event cards the second time which I think I prefer.  The actual production copy has beautiful plastic components although the card quality felt a bit poor (but sleeving them took care of that concern). 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Very interesting first play - gotta plan well or the game is lost from the start. It is quite clever - I tried to use my opponent's gates to focus on other aspects, but it didn't work out well. We did play with the optional events which also threw a major monkey wrench into my plans - you may want to avoid the event cards for more controlled game play.

Feels a bit like two currencies at play although one is used to acquire the other which is then positioned on the map to acquire other necessary buildings and such. Timing is crucial as is positioning. I'd likely suggests playing without the event cards in your first play or two as those just sow a bit of chaos to mess with your plans (perfect information without event cards). Depends on your preference there. The cards used for special abilities are a nice touch and are impossible to plan for in advance but they can be quite helpful to enhance an action. 

Just remember to move your mothership at the end of your turn - that was the hardest thing to remember to do each and every player turn! :D

RATING: 6
If nothing else it's a better Sol than the eponymous lager and the lumbering Arsenal central defender who was credited with great last ditch tackles that wouldn't have been needed if he'd been concentrating properly in the first place, 
It was precisely because I wasn't concentrating properly that this was such a struggle. To have a reasonable shot at winning you need to think strategically, although it's difficult to plan too far ahead because your mothership moves even more slowly than Brian Kilcline. 
Played after a long and particularly frustrating day at work and suffered for that, so the rating may go up. It gets a plus point for being different and I think it may make an appearance with our group again.
It drags a bit with 5, but the interaction would be probably too limited with 3 or less, so 4 is probably the sweet spot.

RATING: 7
Excellent space theme really shines through. Definitely need to build up an engine to get going on points, as the game can end quickly if you are dithering around just launching ships and flying them without a plan. Inevitably you will have to use other people's gates and generation plants, so strategy here is selecting who to help at which time while you garner the aid you need to get your engine going.

Sol: Last Days of a Star is a rare game where the rules dovetail together; where an apparently straightforward set of options blossom into strategies, and the more times you play it, the deeper it becomes. Each turn only allows a single action, keeping the game moving at a fairly quick pace, and the suited effects allow you to tailor the feel of each game to your preferences -- or shuffle them and play a new twist every time you play. It's a beautiful game mechanically and thematically - and I recommend it highly.

Interesting game with a simple enough to understand theme. Choosing when to use your resources and generate new ships was important, run too low of ships and you don't get to activate the stations you've built. Run too low on energy and you won't make efficient use of  momentum generators (victory points).

The variable card powers you receive for activating within the corona of the sun also add a nice tactical element to the game too.

Sol: Last Days of a Star is a somewhat abstract engine-building game about building up enough energy to leave your dying star before it explodes.  I call it engine-building because of a clear progression of building tokens you need to construct on the board.  Your mothership travels clockwise around the sun, spitting out sundiver ships.  These sundiver ships are used to create and activate the buildings, including energy nodes to get energy, towers to turn the energy into points, and foundries to create more sundivers.  However, each of these buildings is more productive on spaces that are closer to the sun, so players can also use sundivers to create gates that let them move between rings.  Buildings and gates are owned by players, but anyone can use them, granting the owner a bonus.  There are also special power cards available that vary from game to game.  I find that this game is largely about coming up with a good plan and making the timing work out, especially with your mothership moving around at a fixed rate.  I really enjoyed the gameplay, but the end-game was a little off-putting to me.  Because it's widely variable how long the game will be, you can't really plan for how ambitious you want to be.  There can be a lot of leap-frogging at the end of the game too, making it fairly random who happens to be ahead when the end-game card comes up and the game immediately ends.

Quite the interesting game. First off, the player aids, mini rules reference and art/story book are an EXCELLENT addition to this game. A lot of hardwork and care went into this to make it a superb release. Seriously, I can't comment highly enough about that. Not to mention the pieces are top notch, although the sundivers are a tad annoying to pickup or move properly. They're just too tiny, even if I understand why.

You launch sundivers from your mothership that constantly rotates around the sun. This right here throws a wrench into your plans. It doesn't seem like much, but like 2-3 turns later, you're all of a sudden super far away from your structures. These sundivers either align to create a larger structure and are removed from the board, or they activate those structures on the board and come back to you. Either way, the constant movement of the mothership and the ebb and flow of the sundivers and energy makes this one fun and interesting. Not to mention they have cards that change up how the game is played each time. I don't think they drastically affect the game state, but it allows for some clever play and trying to best maximize those. You also have to use other peoples structures to win or at least do well. You just need to make sure you're getting the better deal out of it instead of helping them too much.

It's got the same concept as something like Dominion or Steam. When do you switch from income to points? The sooner, the better, but if you do it too early, you end up floundering around with not much of an income and if you do it too late, you'll run out of time to generate momentum.

I don't know how repetitive the game will be after a dozen or so plays, but it does seem to have about the same level of difference in each game as Quantum does, which should provide a decent amount of replayability. I think I would also prefer this game with a higher player count. 2 was fine, but it was quite a large area to finally get back to a structure so you either had to create them 1/4 of the board apart or try to waste most of your movement coming back to a structure.

Edit: A few minor rules fixes. We built gates a touch wrong. You choose the section they go in. Not sure how to describe this better, but we were building them along the entire black line of one section instead of being forced to choose if the inner section was split weird. We also were getting a free activation along the inner ring when solar flares were drawn. I didn't realize there was a designation among the 2 outer rings, so it's only the furthest ring that gets a free activation. Other than that, I think I got the rest of the game down pat. Simple rules, excellent game play.

Edit 2: Solo scenarios look more like puzzles than they do an actual game. At least the first scenario looks like you could do the exact same thing every game and win each time if you "figured it out". Not that I'm sure I could remember, but it looks like you could just try to knock out the scenario and move on to next.

Edit 3: Solo scenarios are actually kind of fun. Yes, it's a puzzle, but it's entertaining enough that I'd be happy to knock out one if I feel like a solo game. Turns are so fast though that you sometimes forget to move your ship or if you've already discarded a card for the turn.

I play tested this game twice at Kublacon 2015 and again once at Gamestorm 2016. It's got a unique cooperative/competitive aspect that I found fresh and surprising. If you like fun Sci-Fi themed board games, pick up a copy of Sol, I predict you'll play it many times over.

I wanted a game with a deep sci-fi theme, and Sol nailed it. The mechanics and theme go so well together and make the game very immersive. The board is beautiful, and I love that everyone’s mothership has a different design. So much variety is built into the box that I feel like we haven’t even scratched the surface. The rules took a bit to master with so many components and nuances, but the player aids are very helpful. We play with the co-op rules because it seems sad to leave anyone, even a competitor, drifting hopelessly through the black void of space. Even just writing about it is making me itch to play again.

Played at BGG con 2016, and loved it. I love building things in games, and this lets you build a lot. It's very competitive without being confrontational (unless you use the cards that let you be confrontational, but I don't know why you would ever do that, you jerk). It's really the best game I played during the whole con. Excellent game, excited for production to finish so I can get a copy.

I played a fairly early prototype of this, but it was interesting.  It definitely had some evolution to go but I cannot deny it was a good game and I would try it again.  Hopefully they will be back at Gamestorm and have things even more refined by then. :)

*** UPDATE ***
I have now played this game literally dozens of times.  I have continue to alternate the rule sets and the game keeps getting better.  As a foundation, the game is "There".  They have added quick start rules (which cuts game time down to 30 minutes or so) and they have really refined the instructions so it's easy to jump right in to your first orbit around the star!

I tend to shy away from games that leave you stuck in their rule set and their rule set only.  I have felt the rules are adaptable enough for me to make it a game that our group plays over and over.  This is worth a "point" to me.

How did I come up with a perfect 10?

1.  Replayability.  Can I play it again and again?  Yes.  3 out of 3 points.  The math works out that there is no single strategy that is the win button and I like that there is some element of chance, but a good player can adapt and fight fate!
 
2.  Can you screw the other guy?: Check!  But because the cards are set up in a way you don't even have to use the screwage cards, it is perfect for any type of gaming group. 3 out of 3 points.

3.  Flexibility/Future expansion.  We have been able to adapt the game to make player vs player scenarios part of the game play, without ruining the overall feel of the game.  We even played a co-op style scenario where everyone was working together to harness enough energy so that we could all be saved!  The game has such depth you can really take it places if you want, OR out of the box it works perfectly.  3 out of 3 points.

4.  Storyline:  I usually only offer 1 point for storyline as it is not critical to me in a board game, but in this case Sol hit it out of the park for me.  I felt a despair and desperation that the story sets right at the beginning and the sudden burst of hope as you begin to gain your momentum to get out of dodge. 1 out of 1 point.


Overall:  This game is a staple, and will be part of our board gaming experiences over and over and over.  We will continue to "make the game our own" and we will play it different than everyone else, but will have a ton of fun doing it.

Sol hits it out of park with a game that is better than anything you'll see out of the major game houses.  I don't need a 79th version of Monopoly, I need some Sol!


*** ORIGINAL REVIEW ***
I don't bother to actually post a review of a game I don't like.  Sol hits just about as close to a perfect game as I have played in a long time.  I have literally play-tested hundreds of games over the years, and rarely do I find a game that fits my overbearing standards.

The game plays well with groups that want to play aggressively OR cooperative OR somewhere in between.  Cooperative?  Not in our game group, we want to step on necks.  If this isn't your play style, Sol still fits the bill.  It has the ability to adjust the game, without unbalancing it, to fit your play style.

It's polished.  Although the game isn't yet in production as of writing this, it is clear the creators went through a lot of trouble polishing the rule set and balancing the game out.  There isn't the overwhelming resource smurfing, or the completely random and haphazardness of a pure game of chance.  Strategy plays a role, and planning for the inevitable is important.

The story line is something that hooked me right away and I look forward to more from Elephant Laboratories in the near future.

I wanted to like Sol a lot more than I ended up liking it. The components are beautiful, and I normally a good action point optimization puzzle.

But the rules for placement, your ships moving slowly across the board and then disappearing off the board anytime you use them for anything (and multiple ships if you're building structures), and being limited to choosing only one of the three action categories per turn led to me having a lot of turns that were basically me just doing one or two things and not being able to take full advantage of the turn, and several turns that just felt like nothing more than trying to get everything in place to do what I needed to do.

Like I'd do the thing I want to do (which would consume the ship), then move 1 or 2 ships to ship builders (over 2+ turns), then build more ships, then deploy those ships, then move, then move, then move, then activate, then start the cycle all over again. So I'd get one fun turn followed by four or five 'setup' turns.

Everyone else at the table was similarly wasting several of their turns throughout the game. Also, it felt like it took literally forever to get more ships out to the other side of the board after you had to remove the previous ones to build your structure, as your mother ship takes its sweet sweet time to get back over there and if you moved your ships directly it'd take turns and turns and turns to get there.

At one point I stopped trying to build my own stuff and just kept bombarding my opponent's best VP structures with my own ships, and because I started doing it slightly before everyone else caught on (they were too obsessed with slowly accumulating the resources and ships to build their own structures), I managed to squeeze out a victory by the time the game ended, but it didn't feel super satisfying.

I'd play it again, and maybe I'd play somewhat more efficiently the second time around, but I just felt like I was fighting the systems in this game constantly just so I could do what I really wanted to do.

Excellent component quality and production value. Game falls a little short for our group due to zero player interaction - it is effectively a solo race game, with each player playing a solo game and comparing scores at the end. The non-conflict approach may suit some groups, but it missed the mark with us a touch. I'll be giving this a whirl as an actual solo game soon.

Sol is a blast.  While the mechanics weren't immediately intuitive, once I had it figured out, the gameplay was utterly satisfying.  Add a unique theme and beautiful components and you have all the makings of a wonderful game.  Playtime feels very quick because you're never able to get exactly what you want or need before the star explodes, but that really only adds to the theme.  Player turns are also lightning quick, so a four player game would still have virtually no down time.  I look forward to playing again.

The peaceful orbit of your mother ship around the dying sun, mixed with the tension of impending solar collapse creates a paradoxical zen frenzy that I haven't experienced in any other game.

I'm not sure that I would have necessarily sought out Sol on my own, but I am so glad that we acquired it. I love the mixture of competitive and cooperative play that the game encourages. What's more, there is an inherent satisfaction in, over the course of three turns, strategically building infrastructure, moving your sundivers into place, and activating several structures of the same type for maximum efficiency. This game is, shall we say, a star.

Wow! What an inspired, unique and entertaining design. Despite the horde of milquetoast cube/card/dice-converters coming out these days, the hobby is indeed alive and well thanks to games like Sol. A spatial logistics game where players use each others' structures (and you get a benefit when an opponent uses your structure); has all the shared incentive and supply/demand considerations I love in games. 

The twist that really sets Sol apart is that players' motherships - which are slowly orbiting the outer ring of the sun - are the only spawn points for new units to come onto the board. It creates a constant logistical struggle for players to manage, and meshes well with the whole coopetition aspect. Even in the late game when most of the structures have been built, things are still interesting since new units are needed to do pretty much anything. 

The whole orbiting mothership mechanic is an ingenious idea that really conveys the theme and creates some intriguing game dynamics. The rest is very well thought out and complements the central idea beautifully, down to the one-use special cards that are different each game to spice things up.

We played without the trigger event cards and removed the red "take that" happy cards from the special powers deck.

RATING: 6
Barely explored so far, but seems a fine game, even a bit better than expected. More like a traditional abstract than I expected, and much, much heavier than expected for that reason.

I'm slightly concerned that this will be one of those games where your moves may wind up benefiting other players more than yourself, so the game ends up about who helps their neighbor the least (as with most Michael Schacht games, for instance). Some folks like that, but I don't.

This is a really engaging theme. The mythos book that came with the KS version was a treat.

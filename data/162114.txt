A nice set collection card game that has some friendly card stealing and plays in less than 30 minutes. A gem from Essen 2014.

I need, and want, to play it much more to figure out better the tricks of this clever and nasty card game.

First impression: very good filler.

*update*

Second impression: Wow! An instant hit in our game group. Amazing, comparable with the classics Bohnanza, 6 Nimmt, etc... Nowadays it looks like these kind of card games have less chances to make an impact, if this game where published 10 years ago it would be in every gamer's collection. Today the choices are too much and is the reason why very good new games like Hamsterbacke remain unknown for most gamers. 

I don't understand how Linko! got so much good critics being a clear inferior game than Hamsterbacke. Maybe is a matter of luck or is just publicity...

Quite interesting take on set collecting. There's a nice balance on holding cards and trying to score them as sets and timing is important. Liked it.

Only played twice. A nice little quick trick taking game where you choose which cards to take and when to score to most inconvenience your opponents. Good fun.

If you cut through the undeserved buzz at the Essen '14 Amigo stand for [thing=162152][/thing] (a dice game which looks like it has a ton of downtime) hiding amongst the 2014 releases was this lovely little game.

Amigo games are so cheap (6 euro for this) you can take a punt.

Like the brilliant Abluxxen this is another card game which does not seem to derive from any other.   The cards are numbered 1 to 4 and come in coloured sets, 2 different colours for each number, only 1 colour in the 4s.  

You can do two things in your turn, of three available things to do.  You can take one of the 8 piles of cards (and add cards back into the piles), or you can play a set of identical cards from your hand as long as another player has not just played that colour, or you can turn previously played cards over into your scoring pile and at the same time steal cards from the player with the most in their hand.  There is more detail to the rules than this but that is the essence of the game.

All very simple but it feels very fresh.  It is no Abluxxen, but I put that as the very best card game to emerge in...well, maybe ever?  I have only played once and it may not last the course but it is a lovely little game which will certainly repay its 6 euro cost many many times over before I get tired of it.

Hamsterbacke is a card collection game that I'd place in the same category as, for example, Abluxxen. You try to get and score as many cards as you can but if you get too greedy there is a good chance other players will steal a sizeable chunk of your loot before you can actually score it. Quick, some interesting choices, pretty interactive. Quite a nice filler.

This is a card game with very simple rules that feels a bit like a worker placement game - you have two actions each turn and need many more. Decisions, decisions. Quite entertaining.

Hamsterbacke is one of those unassuming games.  It starts out with you thinking there's really not much strategy or choice, like no matter what, you HAVE to take an action.  However, as the game continues, you realize there's a lot going on here.  High risk with high reward.  The concept of scoring allowing the player to take cards from the player with the most cards makes for some excellent strategies.  Good fun!

This is a cute little card game filler. You take cards to add to your hand then play sets in front of you. Finally you can bank the sets in front of you for points and when you do you may be able to steal cards from someone's hand and add them to your score pile. The player being stolen from chooses which cards to lose. You can only steal if that player has more hand cards than you. 

The game is very tactical as you try to collect and play sets without being stolen from. Cute, and I would gladly play again.

Belongs to a genre of small annoying card games where the best move for me is not to play at all.

There's a cool three layered passive hand card limit. If you have too many cards you score minus points in the end, you allow others to steal cards from you and you won't be stealing cards from others yourself. The blockade pile restricting card play is also neat.

Light and quick, yet entertaining card game. Great for players prone to AP, but works as a filler as well.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

I've really enjoyed this little card game the first few times I've played although the end game devolves a bit into a bit of a delaying action trying to force others to take cards to end the game as each card in hand is a negative point.

Set collection in a unique format, despite comparisons to Linko. Super cute hamster artwork on the cards! Plays quick. Good filler.

Bought in Germany October 2014. Nifty little set collection, better with 4 or 5 rather than 3 as there is more blocking. Easy enough rules for non gamers also so a good family game.

Wow, how did I miss this one at Essen?
This is a great little card game with artwork that reminds me of Abluxxen. Fast filler game with enough opportunities for strategic and tactical play.
Looking forward to more games of this little gem.

Players attempt to collect sets of cards in this light, push-your-luck card game. Both clever and nasty, this has more room for strategy than first appears. The game requires you to both manage your own cards and pay attention to what others are collecting. Very fun and not like much else!

Fun card game. Collect cards from the 'hamster-wheel' (card layout), play sets & then convert to points. 
Sneaky bit is that when you convert to points you get to steal cards from the player with most cards in hand & these go straight in your score pile!
Simple rules, fun to play.

As a once-proud owner of five Syrian hamsters, I can assure you that Hamsterbacke does not reflect a hamster’s actual dietary habits. Instead, this is a quirky and abstract set collection game in the same vein as [thing=153065][/thing]. Players alternate between drawing cards, playing sets down and scoring those sets. There are two wrinkles – a set may not be played down if an identical set is already in play, and a player who scores a set gets to pilfer cards from the player with the most cards in hand. Any cards left in hand at the game end scores negative points.

The tension in the gameplay is quite clever; collecting more cards helps you form high-scoring sets, but it simultaneously exposes you to having cards stolen. And the seemingly harmless blocking rule can lock sets in hand at the worst possible time. Keeping track of the number of cards in opponents’ hands is crucial here, so expect constant questions regarding hand size throughout. The only quibble is that you can be left with no option in the last few turns other than to draw cards – thus taking on negative points.

This is a friendly card game, balancing hamstering card with blocking and scoring. It is quite light, but the art is adorable. It's a nice finish to a game night, but certainly not a mainstay of the filler cabinet.

tl;dr: good stuff

Do we really need another numbered-cards-game? No, but as long as they're fun, I don't mind it. We've seen plenty of good ones ([thing=153]Take 5![/thing], [thing=12942][/thing] and more recently [thing=153065]Abluxxen[/thing]) and plenty of redundant ones. I would place this in the category of better ones. There is a very nice amount of turn angst. Do you play your cards now or wait just one more turn with the hopes to score big? Works very well indeed, I look forward to playing this again.

Initial rating: 7/10
BGG scale: 7/10

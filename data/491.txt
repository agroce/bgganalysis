I had fun with WoP, but I'm used to playing China. Consequently, I found the two face up cards to be a little limiting. I had to adjust my strategy a bit and didn't do as well as I do with China. Also, as a four-player game it felt a little cramped... so far I've only played China three-player. I need to give Web of Power a few more goes before I see which game I prefer, but right now China has the edge.

RATING: 9
A deceptively ponderous thinker without creating too much paralysis. I find the way each player's move opens up options for the others to be quite beautiful. Suffers somewhat from the problem that a weak (or malicious!) player can practically guarantee victory for the player to his or her left. A novice playing among experts may require some coaching and/or blunder-prevention.

RATING: 10
This game started out as an '8' for me and took about two years to rise up to a '10.'  It's by no means a "perfect" 10, but everytime I play it, I just marvel at how all works - the simplicity, the depth, just the right amount choices and tension.  I'm always ready to play this one. [rating for China: 8.  I like the double-sided board, and the map is more dynamic, road-wise, but I miss the less balanced advisor connections from the original (most were 3's) and the double scoring of regions - both of which allowed for a non-advisor strategy to be viable.  With the newer balanced advisor connections (most are 4's) placing a few seems mandatory for winning, especially now that regions only score once.  In fact, it almost feels like the doubling chip - which I do not care for - was brought in to balance this out.  Even so, this great, original system still shines through.]

10/24/14: Played this back to back with another Schacht (Mondo), and it was interesting how much more I enjoyed this one.  

Area control with a couple of different scoring mechanisms.  One of the things that I like about it is that it's short enough that it doesn't outstay it's welcome.

Plays well with 4, may be best with 3.

RATING: 3
A game that feels like "El Grande lite", and it can be finished very quickly. However, I've never come across a strategy that can actually give me the upper hand. As most of Schacht's designs, it suffers from obscure strategies. On the plus side, it's the only game I somehow like from Schacht.

UPDATE: How can a game so light as this continue to evade it's most basic tactics to me? I don't gt it, and besides I get frustrated by not getting it. Rating dropped to a 3.

Quick, simple game where card play dictates play on the board. The multiple ways of scoring make this a great game. Many have made comparisons between K&K and Paris Paris.

This is just a great area influence game. It took me a couple of plays to really see the depth of this game. I rate this a 10 because there is a lot of strategy in just 30 minutes. The components are also top notch and because of the playing time you can even play this one as a filler! One of my favourites.*Update: Rating has gone down to an 8.5 probably played too many games now. Will not suggest anymore but are still willing to play occasionally.

A winner. Buy it, you will play it often.
Game has to be the most compact strategic game ever. 30 minutes playing time and still a map of medieval Europe to build your "influence". Ideal strategic family game and for those with only a few minutes left in their hectic lives.
I think the game works best with 3 or 4 players. With 5 it's too chaotic. Don't forget to put out a number of cards before play if you are with less than 5 players.

[i]Posted: 3/20/06, Rated: 9[/i]

Area control (AC) with cards.  I ought to be cringing at this point; see my comments for [i][thing=199]Manhattan[/thing][/i] and [i][thing=1041]San Marco[/thing][/i].  I like AC games, but traditionally they have included too much random chance to really win me over.

Until now.

[i]Web of Power[/i] is an awesome "little" game.  I say "little," because the number of things you can do each turn is actually quite limited.  You can take a maximum of two actions during your turn.  The rules feel a little fidgety on first learning.  Stick with it, and the rough edges fade into a beautiful mosaic of strategic options.  The game definitely has the "it" factor: the sit on the edge of your seat, watching with nerve-wracking impatience, hoping for the right play to still be available.  When it's your turn, you would love to be able to take [i]three[/i] actions, instead of only two.

The right move may be preventing your opponents from an easy score, trying to get a little slice of the action for yourself in a province, or a daring play in the hopes of winning a superiority in Advisors.

The total number of Advisors (from all players) that can be placed in a province is equal to the greatest number of Cloisters in the same province that are owned by any [i]single[/i] player.  This limitation really adds a lot of tension towards the end of the game.  The trick is to position yourself to gain the lead in cloisters by placing just one of them, and with your remaining point to place an Advisor.  Most of the time, you find yourself one behind the leader in number of cloisters, wishing for that third move.  Beautifully agonizing!

Proper hand management is important.  The presence of two face-up cards next to the draw pile, along with the ability to turn in two matched cards as a wild card definitely reduces the amount of luck needed to win.  In my opinion, these features alone make [i]Web of Power[/i] a superior AC game over [i][thing=1041]San Marco[/thing][/i] or [i][thing=199]Manhattan[/thing][/i].  Good draw pile control is perhaps even more important: you want to be able to bring the game to an end on your terms.

I haven't played [i][thing=18100]China[/thing][/i] yet, but if it is similar to [i]Web of Power[/i], then you should give it a try, at least online.  It's a fun, relatively fast title that takes a simplified version of the Area Control formula, and produces a real gem of a game.

RATING: 10
p: tonight, after having had this down as a richly deserved 9.5 for years, I had that one gaming moment that has finally made this a solid 10. Played it as a 3 player game with people, who between them have placed more cloisters than there are verses in the bible, and we all 3 had to look back on a game that beared no resemblance to anything we had played before.

To repeat here that this is a tense, quick-playing tight game in which you will face dilemmas all the way through, and one in which you will continuingly be adjusting strategies is mainly repeating the well-settled sentiment of those who gravitate towards slightly abstract games with wafer thin, although befitting and enjoyable themes. Even more so if they prefer elegant and stripped-down systems that make the most of a handful of core mechanics over historically accurate simulations, games involving direct combat, or those that are souped up with lots of chrome.

What struck me tonight though, and made it a rare 10 for me, is that even after all this time, it evolved into unexplored territory that surprised 3 "veterans" (apply pinch of salt generously), and any game that keeps revealing more layers than a fresh onion has to be a price winning vegetable. 

If you want to argue that this game isn't for you, fair enough. There are many different types of players here all looking for different things in a game. However, if you want to argue that there is no player interaction here, than connect-4 must be a player interaction free game in your household as well. Simply because you can't take any of your opponent's pieces doesn't mean there is no interaction. Heck, as far as I can see this is ALL interaction as there isn't a single move that won't affect your next play. If you say you can only play defensive than you must live a bit more adventurous. NOT playing defensively, but throwing the board wide open is often a viable strategy for the struggling player as it might well be possible to revisit a previously lost-looking situation and topple it in your advantage (a bit like in "Go"). If you say that the luck of the draw can mess up your plans, you certainly have a point, but avoiding getting in that situation and dealing with it when you do has less of an influence for skilful players. More so, if you want to prove a point and give it a 1 simply because others do like it and you don't, you're kinda missing the point by trying to prove one.

A few people have mentioned that they don't like that you get penalised by opening a new territory as you only get to play one. To me, this is one of the cleverest rules in the game and I am reasonably sure that the tension and tightness in the game is exactly the result of this restriction. Being able to play two pieces when opening, fundamentally changes the dynamics of the game, as these moves are proportionally much more controlling opening moves, and it would completely remove one of the elements that makes this a game of skill. Your hand and pick-up options will determine wether it is in your interest to open somewhere, or not. Opening has advantages and disadvantages. When, where and how is judgement. And it this game, the pleasure mostly comes from seeing your own brilliant plans work out vaguely as conceived. Or seriously messing up your opponent's carefully crafted ones using as little resources as possible. 2 well-placed advisors can ruin an otherwise incredible advisor score, and 1 well-placed cloister can pick up nearly as much points as 5 other ones. That's where it becomes genius.    

I suspect that people who don't like this rule have adopted a style in which players (mostly) fill a territory until control is reasonably settled, and players only move to new territory if there is nothing for them in the contested one.That way I can think of a few sequences in which a player does indeed hand over any chance of winning. But if you know you get hammered that way, why keep doing it? The reason why I like this game so much is because there are 3 ways to score heavily, and it is using, and more importantly, threatening to use these options that will keep your opponents on their toes.

It was the Puerto Rico or Caylus of the early 2000's, and as, to me, it does more with fewer elements, I rate it higher. It's one of the few games I have rated upwards after frequent plays. It now has become a 10 so if it surprises me once more I will have to move my advisors into the controlling chambers of BGG and force Aldie to erect a long chain of pulpits in my colour to allow me to gush about this gem even more...

CHINA: having played China, I kinda feel that there is something utterly balanced about Kardinal und Konig, since when NOT picking up jokers is nigh impossible, the game completely seems to lose its edge. I can see why restrictions can be frustrating, but here they are somehow so well-balanced that they add to the game. China did have some features I did like, but it will always stay little more than a diversionary alternative. As a challenge, the Kardinal still rules.

I like this game.  I don't see why snoots here seem to turn their nose up at China and gush over Web of Power.  They are practically the same game, and the China board is much clearer, so nuts to them.

This is the game I use to test whether people's opinions are worth listening to.  If someone says Web of Power is "clearly" or "much" better than China, or even worse says it's more "elegant", but can't describe why very convincingly, I can safely write them off as snoots who like either (a) whatever they played first, and/or (b) whichever is harder to acquire.

Played once and didn't follow the scoring explanation, so I was somewhat disadvantaged. This game is worth more respect than I gave it!

Once playing, it was easy to grasp the concepts, but it was too late by then! The game concept is clever in that the best actions run the avaalble cards down faster and bring scoring rounds closer. Different sized regions give another variable to consider. You always feel as if there's not enough time to perform all the actions you would like to.

Once you know the game, you could play it in half an hour, so it would be tempting to get 2 games in whilst you have the components out.

Web of Power is actually an abstract game with simple rules that can be played very quickly. Unfortunately, halfway through our first game we found out we were misinterpreting one vital rule regarding advisors, something that totally spoiled the game for me.

Although it is now out of print, Web of Power was later reprinted as China, apparently with an improved map.

Interesting differences between this and China. I'm not sure which I prefer. I think the 2 cards used here (instead of 4) make for harder decisions, but perhaps a more luck-dependent game.

Good, quick abstract (which is too bad, because the art is of a very high quality and deserves a game that utilizes it).  Good amount of fun considering how quickly it plays.  Liked it better the second time.  Think about this game a lot.

CHINA Update - I like it as much as I do Web of Power, and it feels slightly different.  This is a good thing.  Very pleased with the look, feel, and play of China, though I do not love the skinny box.  Highly recommended.

This is a delight - a good quick game with some tough decisions to be made. It almost doesn't last long enough, which is good enough reason to play it twice in a row - and at this length and weight you not only can but will enjoy the second as much or more instead of the experience going downhill.

Another minimaist Michael Schacht game, more interesting than most of his games, but still fails to rise above the marginal. Fails to engage on any level, either theme, strategy, player interaction, or fun, plus it's not as short as its content would seem to require. May be a candidate for my "most overrated" list, except that I haven't seen anybody actually play it since about 4 months after it came out.

I think KuK has too much luck in terms of getting the cards you want.  I don't appreciate the "do what you can when you can" thing, and feel this is corrected in China.  Plus, you don't have a territory floating out in the middle of nowhere, making it obsolete to chains.  China's board is beautiful, its pieces are excellent and the game plays quicker because you can plan more on other player's turns.

RATING: 6
A light weight, card driven area influence game that is easy enough to teach to non-gamers, yet engaging enough to draw me back for repeat plays. The game is on the abstract side, but the rapid pace and tight decisions make up for it. 

I often wonder how much meaningful control players can keep because of the card system though. I used to rate this quite a bit higher, but after playing a large number of area influence games lately it's really taken a significant battering. Just too limited. That said, if you have only 20-30 minutes for an area influence game this isn't a bad option. I also would imagine that the larger pool of cards in the reprint, China, would make the game a little too easy. I dislike the smaller pool because it takes away control, but in a game like this, sometimes it is better to limit such control, as the trade-off is tough decisions.

One of those Euros that feels so harmless and inoffensive to play it's almost irritating...that being said, it's not a terrible game and it actually has a handful of decent decision points in it even though it's pretty much scripted by card drafting.   More or less an abstract game, but with 3 players and a 30 minute play time you can do a lot worse.

Another of what I call "Area Control" games. This one is not as good as Attila, El Grande, Wallenstein and Wongar. Its the quickest of the bunch but I would say the strategy is not quite as deep.

Egyik nap elővettük, játszottunk vele kettőt, és nagyon hasonlított a Patrician játékhoz (később kiderült, nem is véletlenül, ugyanaz a szerző). A cél: többségi helyzetbe kerülni egy-egy tartományba, vagy ha már a többség nem elérhető, minél több pontot elérni, kihasználva, hogy valaki több kolostort helyezett le egy-egy helyre. Újat nem hozott, nem ragadtatott el, nem éltem bele magam, egy jó taktikai játéknak tartom, de semmi többnek.

An all time favorite that packs a lot of thought and tension into 30 min. window - something that is tough to do.   

Though I'm glad the core game is available again in China, I find the original to be superior.  Requires different approaches to win for 3, 4 and 5 players.  Although I enjoy best with 3, it is one of those rare finds that works well at all player counts and I'll never turn down a game. 

Web of Power has become an evergreen and true classic!

RATING: 8
Kardinaal & Koning (Web of Power in English) is a game I long overlooked because the subject matter seemed rather boring and detached: power struggles between kings and clergy in the 12th century...? Sounds almost as interesting as being a tax inspector in Central Europe. However, when it eventually did end up in the collection, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that lurking beneath that odd exterior is a clean and very polished majority game with a game play resembling that of greased lightning, especially with 3 players. There is nothing in this game which needs to be taken out, and anything you add would just be superfluous. There are just two problems with it: one is that there is a considerable amount of luck of the draw, although I've found that it usually allows me to play around it (which is a Good Thing™) so I'm inclined not to complain much about it. The second issue is that as the number of players goes up, the playability drops faster than a lead balloon. With 4 players it's tolerable, with 5 it causes intense convulsions and brain haemorrhage. The reason: far too little control over what you can do and achieve, lethal for a game as precise as this. So giving the game a single rating is a tad hard. I play it as a 3 player-game almost exclusively, and then it gets the rate shown.

The author of this game reworked it into China a few years later (and into Han a few years after [i]that[/i]), which is more or less the same idea with a few changes which seem to help at higher player numbers. I still consider the original to be the superior title, though.

RATING: 7.35
This abstract game requires players to build up majorities in various regions on the map, both in the number of cities, but also in the regional advisers.  A long route is worth extra points at the end, but the real key is getting in on the action in an as many regions as possible, and getting strong scores across borders for having the majority of advisers on each side.

It's a real brain-burner puzzle that requires strategic planning and tactical play.  I think it likely takes several plays to really get your brain wrapped around how to do well.  This is one I know I personally want to try again soon to give it another go.

Components: Sturdy, colorful components and cards. The artistic design obscures the town locations and road paths, making it a challenge to quickly count up the contents of a region, or the length of a road.

Experience: Interesting decisions. In my opinion, the double scoring of the regions de-emphasizes the cloisters, as contrasted to China. A game in which limited options still lead to engaging decisions.

The only reason this doesn't score 1 out of 10 is that the game at least presents a briefly interesting puzzle.

The game cuts off short in the first half just when you're getting into it, then goes on too long in the second half when everyone is bored.  Don't play this game!

Always a pleasure to encounter a quick game that provides some depth. It's area majority -- in fact, two different types of area majority --- for those who find El Grande not much fun. You may be able to neglect the cloisters, but scoring with your advisors seems essential. And, while the cards you draw determine where you place your pieces, those cards give you enough choices that you cannot make a credible claim that your draws hosed you.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not sure about the fact that one or more players can get an extra turn before the first scoring round.  It might be mitigated by the need for that person to open an area, but I think not, since a person's starting hand will probably dictate that they must open an area, or at best play once only.

An elegant area control game, with a pretty noticeable luck factor.  However, since the game zips right along in 20 minutes, luck is never really that big a problem.

All in all, recommended, although in saying that, there are many better games around that I prefer to play.

Very good game of placement and influence in medieval Europe. Players play one to three cards from a three card hand to position pieces in provinces on the map. Points are awarded for majorities, road chains and majorities of advisors between bordering provinces. Fast game play and excellent scoring mechanisms overshadow a problem with the luck of getting the cards you require to develop your strategies. For a 20 minute game however, you can&#039;t really complain about it! Definitely recommended.

I really enjoy how quick this game is.  This game almost feels like Ticket to Ride crossed with an Area Control game. I say this because you use cards in your hand to place pieces on the board and it's best to try to connect your houses in a route of 4 houses or more in a row for bonus end of game scoring. When you refresh your hand of cards you have the option of taking a face up card or one from the draw deck which is also reminiscent of TTR.  Overall you have a quick experience with some meaningful decisions and that suits me just fine.  This above is the same comment I've written about China.  

With that said I do prefer Web of Power for a number of reasons: (1) The graphic design is better... better colors, unique emblems for each region, more familiar map, better score track. (2) The game box is not as awkward to fit on the shelf as China. (3) I preferred to do one bit of scoring at half-game than scoring every time a region fills up in China.  This also ties with the fact that regions can be scored multiple times in WoP compared to once in China.  I feel this makes where you place your houses more important than in China.  Though the half-game cloister scoring may diminish the importance of advisors.  I need to play this more and figure things out.  

It should be noted that I have never played with the fortification rules or Einflusskarten expansion in China so maybe that and the fact that I'm a novice of both games means that I shouldn't be comparing the two games in terms of game play itself.  The physical and graphical comparisons are enough for me that my rating of China will always less than Web of Power.

Great game and a typical Michael Schacht. Agonizing decisions for controlling a country or bonding countries while trying to get chains of 4 houses or more for the additional points. Enough depth for 45 minutes of gaming. High replay value.

A much better game than you'd expect for a simple game of colors and area control. And a very engaging game for how short it is. Seems to play well at different player counts too. Happy to have for that "one more short game before calling it a night" type game. 

The decision points are deceptively difficult. It's so tempting to stop doing something and go do something else, but you're much better off trying to do a few things well than several things mediocrely. You can only place one piece in a territory that isn't open yet so you frequently open up areas for the rest of the table. While that sounds -- and is -- vulnerable, with some subtle timing, you can do it when others are too busy to be bothered with starting something new. 

The player who can slip through being the least noticeable will probably win, and this game. Think of it as an exercise in How Not To Be Seen. (Whatever you do, don't stand up!)

It's a clear ten for three players, fascinating the different ways to win, with less rules and a little bit of card luck... (Depends on the card drawing variant you'll play.) Fast game play that you'll force your players immediately for a replay after your first game.

For four player I ´would still give a 8.5 or 9.

Only the five player game has to much luck factor included, the waiting before you're next turn is too long and you'll have less turns combined with bad cards will be a complete different game to the three-player variant.

A lot of German games are exercises in places pieces which will score points according to some rules set. But they have a theme and some twist on the placement which gives them depth and variation. Kardianl & Konig is PURELY a placement game with absolutely nothing else to it. AND IT'S SUPERB! How such an achingly simple mechanism can produce such a thwarting game is beyond me. Excellent, must buy game.

I like this a lot less than I thought I would.  I'm generally a fan of area control games.  So far I don't find myself to be much a fan of Schacht games.  I'd still like to try the K&K card game, though.  I think it plays too fast and there is too little control with the random card draws.  There are some interesting elements to it but it falls short of a 7 for me.

In WoP players struggle for majorities in several regions in medieval Europe. The game is positioned somewhere between a gamers' game and a family game. It has enough depth to be enjoyable for gamers while at the same time there is quite a bit of luck of the draw. WoP plays quickly, though, so that doesn't really hurt much.

Betrachtet man das Portfolio der Spielerfindungen von Herrn Schacht, so entdeckt man im mittleren Euro-Segment sofort zwei Lieblingsgattungen von Micha: Setz- und Versteigerungsspiele. KARDINAL & KÖNIG ist ein Klassiker der Sorte 1, der Setz- und Mehrheitenspiele. Dabei sollte man berücksichtigen, das K&K ein Werk aus den End-90ern ist, in der CARCASSONNE seinen Siegeszug um die moderne Bretttspielwelt antrat. Umso bemerkenswerter ist dann nämlich, wie archetypisch K&K als Setzspiel funktioniert hat und mit den Abstrichen des natürlichen Alterungsprozess auch heute noch funktioniert: Karte ziehen, abwägen, Stein setzen. That's it. Das fühlt sich heute zwar ein wenig nach bißchen wenig an, was aber wie gesagt nicht am Spiel selbst, sondern nur an der Brettspielzeit liegt, die sich rasant weiterentwickelt hat. Im Kontext seiner Entstehung und den Jahren danach blieb K&K lange Zeit ein blitzsauberes Ding. Auch wenn es inzwischen etwas in Omas junges Herz und graue Haare gekommen ist, so ist es als größerer Absacker immer noch recht gut zu Fuß und ansehnlich wie der liebe, altersweise Opa auf der Parkbank. Und das Altern gehört nun mal zum Leben dazu und darf bis zum Tod mitspielen. Die formal gebrauchte Altersangabe 9-99 passt auf K&K ausnahmsweise mal konkret.

I like WoP's scoring better than "China" but I prefer China's card-draw mechanic.  Other than that, there is not much difference between the two games.  

WoP scores the houses twice - once at mid-game and once at the end.  China scores houses only once.

WoP's card-draw mechanic is more limiting and therefore introduces more luck-of-the-draw: a bad thing.  I give both games the same rating.

My wife got this for me for Christmas, the same Christmas that we got into Settlers of Catan.  Web of Power sat on our shelves for 14 months, not even getting out of the shrink wrap.  Then one day we played it, and discovered that we liked it.  Then it sat in the cabinet for awhile, and we played it much later, and said we liked it.  And it sat in the cabinet.  

Its a good game, but doesn't scream out and beg to be played.  Definitely a keeper, but probably only ever see sporadic play.

Quick and seemingly simple, but a delightful tactical puzzle.  A bit of card-driven luck, but the 2-for-1 jokers greatly reduce that.  An abstract tactical game, but for some reason the theme fits well enough for me.  ("You may have found the King's favor, but the Church still answers to ME!!") I have both expansions, but have not tried either yet.

After several playings this game has earned my first 10.  I can't get over how simple, yet intriguing it is.  The game length and pacing feel just right.  The game ends before you can do everything, and the board is never fully populated at the end. The short game time makes it all too easy to agree to another game.  Great stuff!

This game is often suggested for those wanting a quick 3 player area control game, and I can see why.  Very nice looking board and components.

* You need to bluff/bait your opponents into committing or even over-committing in areas that are important to you

RATING: 8
One of my favourite games for three players, Web of Power is an excellent fast game of majorities that can be played under the 45 minutes border. The game involves some luck in the cards draw but the success depends more in the skill of the players. Easy rules, many tactical options and a fast pace all together create an excellent game, an instant classic that has been reimplemented by China, that is almost the same thing with some improvements (although I prefer Web of Power because of the map and the half game scoring). With four players it is still playable and quite enjoyable but with five it becomes a fest of chaos in the same fashion Ra does (too many other player turns in between yours ruining your well laid plans).

I think this game is amazing.  It plays so well for being so easy to teach.  It is a game that is not only beautifully decorated, but is a prime example of less being more.

Played 10+ 3, 4 & 5 player all good. It must have been tempting for the designer to add “stuff” to this game and yet he chose to keep it very simple. You might find the experience of playing your first game rather hollow and certainly it will appeal to the gamer more than the family. I have found that over time this area influence game has found its way to the table regularly with no sign of us tiring of it. The simple elegance of play might even label it a classic, time will tell. I hope it stays in print for decades to come. *UPDATED* Moved it up to a 9. Web of Power packs a lot of gaming satisfaction into 30-50 minutes. May 05

Super dry themeless card drafting area majority game.  That alone could be an 8 word review of Kardinal & Koenig.  There really isn't any fun here, though I admit its a well put together game.  Your strategy is somewhat driven by the card drafting.  What strategy remains is dictated by what the other players do to you.  Often, their moves are dictated by card drafting.  Once in a while, you do get a decision where you are not sure what to do, but it isn't a heartbreaker.  Just do something so the game will end faster!  Take a dearth of any meaningful choices, add on some dry and boring scoring, mediocre components and a pasted on theme and you have this game.  Overrated.

I find this a good, family style game.  The rules and moves are fairly easy to explain, and there is little confusion through the game as to what you can do.

I have been fortunate to have played this several times without purchasing it.  I have been left somehow flat.  I think it has a thin theme, and a good amount of luck.  While these are not always a bad thing, I find Web of Power to be too long for what it is.  This is similar to my complaints about Clans and Taj Mahal, which have also left me flat.

I prefer the mechanisms in Alhambra for hand management, where you have a little more control and where you have to juggle a few more items.

Very simple game mechanics mask what could be a profound strategy game. Feels like San Marco, without the offer mechanic, as it is an area dominance game, with additional points for a long chain of cloisters, and having majority advisors in any given two neighboring areas. Plays fast in 30 minutes, but doesn't excite me enough to play again, when there are better choices, IMHO, out there, e.g. Oregon, Dominion.

A simple pick a card and play a piece game with plenty to evaluate. 2 face up cards means more luck of the draw factor than in the later version (China), but 2 rounds of cloister scoring is perhaps a better balance. I marginally prefer this incarnation and you can always use 4 face up cards as a house rule. Good to see a satisfying German game you can play in 45 minutes.

Well, I played this long after becoming familiar with China and it is mostly the same game.  The scoring system makes houses slightly more valuable, probably a good idea.  I think I prefer the map in China with its distinct lack of strange island countries.  (1 play)

Meh...it didn't suck, but wasn't what I expected it to be, either.  The Advisors part didn't seem to make a lot of difference except for 1 player.

I dunno... I don&#039;t think the cards mesh with the rest of the game. The board is kind of cool looking. The scoring mechanism is interesting but confusing (especially to a new player). I like the risk you have to take opening a new area (only getting to play once there.)
Pretty good filler, but dry.

RATING: 6
Pick up cards corresponding to states on a board of Europe.  Play some to place houses and cardinals to get points.  Very strategic as you seek to get points most efficiently but very low on theme and richness.  The only chance component is the cards that come up on your turn.  Very typical Eurogame.  It's challenging so I don't not enjoy playing but I end up feeling like I could have spent my time better playing something else.  It's not the sort of game where I replay it in my head afterwards trying to figure out better strategies or coming up with new insights into how to play.  Relatively short game.

Initial Rating: 5.5

Web of Power is not a bad game, it features Area Control (I love this), it can be explained very quickly and it also plays with a fast flow. You don’t feel any downtime at all playing this, a huge plus in my book.  The game is very similar to China,  I don’t remember how they differ other than the map, but I’m sure there is one or two rules differences.

I don´t like that in the middle score, some players have more turns than others, I’m not 100% sure this is the case, but is the way it was explained to me, if this is true, the last players have a huge disadvantage, also I feel the luck of the draw has a lot of impact on the game (funny I remember I didn’t feel that way in China), as our scores were always so close, I feel this luck decided the game for us. Due to this, Web of Power is mainly a tactical game, you need to play the cards that were dealt and have little room for planning ahead, you have to seize the opportunities on your turn-.

This is a game I would play again if requested, but as of now, it is out of my wish list. Web of Power is not a bad game, however I don’t feel any compulsion to play this (or China) for that matter.

Seems to be quite a bit of luck surrounding the drawing of duplicate pairs.  You can manage this to a degree by the way you play and draw cards, but still you can be unlucky and while you are playing one piece a turn others can get luckier and be placing two pieces a turn.  On the plus side lots of hard decisions on which areas to play your pieces into and whether as cloisters or advisers.  It plays quickly.

Another Michael Schacht game with a high luck element.  Like Paris Paris, you have to do the best with what you get each round.  This makes the game a little more strategic than tactical.  Only 3 cards in hand, but sometimes trying to decide which one to play (and how) is excruciating.  The quick play time makes this game a lot of fun... and worth every bit of a 9 rating.

This game has one of the simplest mechanics around. It plays very fast (3-player games last 30 minutes). Very abstract, but no brain-burner because of the limited options on each turn. Because of its length it encourages multiple plays in a row. Has become our favourite 3-player game. Might suffer a little from kingmaking in the last turn. With 4 or 5 players it is much harder too see who is in the lead. So, it becomes less tactical, but still very enjoyable. (12 jan 08 after 21 plays)

This is my type of game. It can be taught in under five minutes, takes 45 minutes to play, and everyone wants to play it again. There is some randomness with the cards you get that helps speed up the play (but there are also mechanics that keep the randomness to a minimum), but you still need some level of skill to win. I also prefer this theme over the remake. Nice bits and board make it look great while playing. Quick to set-up and enough depth to keep it interesting. Would like to see more games like this.

Finally, a game I really like that also features a card draft!

This is a fantastic, tense, quick game of out maneuvering one's opponents. Like Chess, Go and Tigris & Euphrates, I find myself, as a new player, wishing for one extra move per turn. I strongly suspect that with more plays this will develop into a good sense of how to time the moves I'm allowed.

Having played China first, I don't really have a preference between the two.  For me, not being an expert player, I would prefer China, since there are so many games with European conquest as a theme.  I enjoy them both and would play either if asked, but don't have the desire to own this.  What really sets these above other area majority games though is the speed of play, which is very nice.

Awesome!

RATING: 6
Bare-bones area control with two types of majorities, one of them constraining the other. Actions are restricted by cards. Even though the luck of the draw can be managed, fact remains that if you're getting two actions per turn you're getting ahead and if you're getting one you're falling behind, so a lot of the time you aren't faced with real decisions. Probably better with three, as with four each new area fills up instantly... though I'm wondering if this is in essence not just a time-lapse of the three-player game.

Note that the much-maligned rule against placing two pieces in a new country is necessary to prevent someone from doing this and ending the game in the same turn.

Fun fact: an initialism that is sometimes used for this game is also a Swedish naughty word that can be used as a crude expletive, injecting some amusement into a few of the comments around here.

Web of Power is an excellent game that plays differently every time and is always very satisfying. I&#039;ve never had a disappointing experience in the 24 times that I’ve played this game, whether with 3,4, or 5 people. Web of Power is not as dependent on luck as you may think. I believe this is one of the misconceptions shared by those who have not given the game enough playtime. Web of Power just gets better with age. If you don’t feel an overwhelming sense of anxiety before the first piece is placed on the game board, then you haven’t played it enough.

It plays lightning fast, yet gas a tremendous amount of strategy.  Experience is rewarded and new players may get eaten for lunch by old pros.  Timing is everything, and if you can get others to do the dirty work of blocking other people's chains, you may find youreld a winner.  Drawing good cards doen't hurt either.  I prefer this game with 3 players.  Four players is still good.  With 5 the chaos is too much, and the game falters.

This is a really good game. Very quick, decisions are all important but there is no analysis paralysis because of the constraint your cards in hand impose you.

Theme is very light but I like to develop my "wed of influence". The Consellor mecanism is a neat addition to tha classir Area control that the cloisters represent. 

In resume : it's a simple area control game (but not simplist) and it's so quick you always want to play a second time!

The first couple of times I played this game I absoluted hated it.  Fast forward two years when lorna talked me into playing it again.  Something happened on that last play where it all made sense.  I like this one because it plays 3 very nicely, and it is a quick game if everyone already knows the rules.

Short, simple rules but still quite a deep game. Also a little bit dry which keeps this from hitting the table very often, but overall a good game.

i don't like games in which players cannot make real decisions, instead they are restricted to choose from a very small number of possible moves. Players cannot execute their plans because what you can do depends entirely on the other players' moves. Plays better with fewer players though

Incredibly fast for its depth, and so far I think that it offers a lot of both strategy and tactics. What it does not offer is a lot of table banter, but lack of atmosphere is okay for such a fast game. Works equally well with 3,4 or 5 players.

A prototypical german game.  Play cards to place pieces on the board to score points.  When playing this I never really felt any connection at all to a theme and it felt very robotic.

Played once.  This game is China's predecessor, and thus the mechanics are nearly identical (it's an area-influence game wherein players place pieces to control certain regions).  The differences between this and China are few, but have a large influence on gameplay: there are only two cards to choose from (China has three), and each area's basic influence is scored twice (once on the first time through the deck, once at the end of the game; each area is scored only once in China).  Emissaries/advisors are only scored once (at the end of the game), however, so their influence on the game is minimized compared to China.  I think this is a great game to alternate with China, as the differences help keep each game fresh.

無茶苦茶面白そうなのだがと想像してたのだけど、実際やってみたら本当にやたら面白くて参ったね
ここまで高いレベルで各要素がまとめられている、しかも簡潔にと言うのは完全にひれ伏すしかないです
スゴすぎる、スゴすぎます


とりあえず単純な話、手番で教会を一つ置くと1点
これが基本で最低な得点
この1点をどうやって増やすかがポイントですね
仮に一つ教会を置いた地域に誰かが教会を2つ置いてくれたら1点だったものが2点になると言うこと
だから3人プレイ、教会が5マスある地域で2,2,1と置くと2の人は5点一つあたり2.5点で1の人は2点一つあたり2点となるというわけね

RATING: 7
With a hand of three cards, play advisors and/or clositers into a province to compete for majority points.  Advisors only score at the end of the game, with points gained by adjacencies to your majority of other advisors; clositer scoring happens twice. At the end of your turn, replenish your hand from three exposed cards or randomly from the deck; the trick is that duplicates of a card allow you to play as a "wild" card.
Strategy wise, one's fortunes really depends if a province has been filled up before you get a chance to play (since someone before you has opened up a province or you opened up a province) and when refilling to 3 cards, there is luck involved in getting duplicates so that you can potentially get two plays next turn. It is a fun, easy to learn game and plays quickly in 45 minutes.

RATING: 7
This stocky, very German game has a two-fold majority control as a principle: in the first phase of the game it's important to dominate the monasteries of as many countries as possible (by a small margin is best), and in the second phase not only does this apply again, but also additional scores are carried out for connected countries if a player has got the majority of advisors in both. These pieces are laid on the board by playing out cards.

The key of Kardinal & König's strengths and faults lies in the very limited number of options a player has: a hand consists of three cards, out of which a limit of two can be used (or all three if two equal cards are used as a joker), and only if the played pieces lie in the same country. The resultant agony is definitely a plus here, but on the other hand it's very difficult to plan anything long-term, for there are so few possibilities each turn that the other players will always benefit from your own moves. 

Thus, Kardinal & König is most successful if it isn't approached as a brain burner, but rather as a test for intuitive, tactical play.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> 8)[/COLOR]

[i]I really enjoyed my one play of Web of Power and look forward to getting a chance to play again, hopefully at TotalCon again this year. Game play is similar enough to Royals that I didn't pursue picking up a copy, also I have a hard enough time getting the area control games I already own to the table. If you are a fan of area control I'd highly recommend checking this out if you get a chance, it definitely holds up well considering it was first published 17 years ago. IF you are having trouble finding Web of Power it was later re-implemented as China then Han with a few rules tweaks.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Really fun area control game that plays quick, but allows for planning and strategy (at least with three players). What I really appreciated about the game was the three ways to score points all offered a valid way to win even if you mostly focused on one path. I focused on getting out my advisors and didn't score many points until the end of the game. Mat focused on building long networks of connected cities and managed to do quite well, while Charlie hedged his bets and dabbled in everything. In the end we were all within a few points of one another even though we went down divergent paths. Definitely a game I look forward to playing more. I'll probably be looking for a copy, but I also need to check out China and Han which are basically the same with a few rules changes and differences in the maps.[/i]

I like it as a light family game or an opener / closer. It's fast and has a nice combination of luck and scoring mechanics. There is plenty of neat decision making on what you're going to do this / next turn given the cards in your hand, those in the draft and the opportunities currently on the board.

I think the game plays better with 3. With 4 or more, whole countries can disappear from play before its your turn next, so choosing cards with a plan in mind can become a lottery. With 3, your plans have more chance of being actioned.

Excellent area control game.  Feels somewhat like an El Grande Lite, and I think the fact that there are just a few rules, but so many choices to make gives people the ability to play a deeper game without being bogged down by additional technicalities.  Some AP can come from players trying to optimize their moves in what feels like a very crowded board from the beginning.  However, this is more of a player issue than a game element in my opinion.

Web of Power is the predecessor to China. I give WoP 6.5 and China a 7.  China cleans up a few (relatively minor) issues with WoP, and provides a better scoring system and a cleaner double-sided map. More importantly, China's 4 face-up cards vs. WoP's 2 reduce the luck of the draw to a negligible level. WoP is too  reliant on luck of the drawn cards. Both games have some screwage factor but not so much to detract from the game. Overall, this is a fun and tense game with excellent repayability value, although luck plays a prominent role. Surprising reward for so little time investment.

I always play with the variant listed at the back of the rules, and the variant makes it a fantastic game.  This variant is how it was taught to me by Jay Tummelson many years ago, right before the game was published, and so in my mind, the variant will always be the "official" way to play the game.

Area control, card drafting, and majority influence of regions to win victory points. Guessing which cards are being held by your opponents is key. Often feels like a waiting game because players who first place a cloister in a region can only place one (rather than two). Very fast paced game, with only two scoring rounds and two ways to score points (cloisters and advisors). Very similar to Samurai.

Like this theming of the game also.  A bit more restrictive of a game due to less card choices compared to China.  (No reason not to get China if you need to get only one version of this game.)  Enjoy both this and China and will play either depending on the group's desire.

Very fast, area control/card drafting game that provides enough choices in its 30 minute playing time,

The key is the rule that allows using a pair of cards as a wild card--that makes any draw useful and puts premium on using these wisely.

Web of Power -- Played twice; four-player.  Fast yet deep.  Let me rephrase that:  [i]Remarkably[/i] fast yet deep.  I haven't won this game yet, but I find the limited choices elegant, and the gameplay itself quite fun.

Update 13 May 2006 -- Finally played China (four-player).  The few changes to the rules could be incorporated into Web of Power, so there should be no justification for adding China to our collection, however, China's double-sided board just may persuade me to purchase China in spite of the fact that it is otherwise essentially identical to Web of Power.

Update 15 June 2006 -- Yup.  I gone and done it.  Now I gots me a copy of China to go along with Web of Power.

I had heard that this was a light version of El Grande; it is, but even more like a light version of Taj Mahal. A relatively quick game that still has depth, for more than 2 players.

Initial impressions put it in the Ra category of weight. Very simple mechanics each round, with tough decisions and limited actions each turn.

Something about it, however, is a little half-baked. Close to the end, you may have basically nothing to do, or no reason to do it, since you gain nothing and only help an opponent who can capitalize on your move.

Web of Power is an area-majority type game, but one stripped down to bare essentials. I was concerned that I wouldn't care for it, given that Hansa kind of falls flat for me - but I was pleasantly surprised. There are many "good" games of this type, such as Tikal and El Grande, but I like Web of Power above the others. I think this is because it is so streamlined. Even though I initially liked Tikal, over time I found that playing with more people dragged the game out painfully due to too many possibilities to consider, and that playing with two left me hankering for the deeper strategy of playing with four. El Grande has always felt like a hodge-podge game to me, to its detriment. It just isn't compellingly fun for me - many disagree, holding that it combines many different game play elements in a thrilling mosaic of gaming goodness.

In Web of Power, players take turns placing either monasteries or advisors on one of nine 12th century European countries using one or more cards from their three-card hands. When the draw deck is depleted, there is a scoring round with players amassing points for monastery majorities in the various countries. The second time the draw deck is depleted, the monasteries are scored again, and the advisors are scored as well - and both scoring methods are roughly similar. In both cases, you are going for a majority (ties are okay). Players also get points (one point per monastery) at the end of the game for each chain of four or more monasteries linking continuously along a road. From the fairly simple mechanics arises a tense game of outmanuvering your opponents. A piece laid is a piece played, so players will viciously cut off their adversaries attempts to create monastery chains - and a difficult decision must be made every turn as to whether to play a monastery or advisor, and in which country. You will "run out of time", never getting to place as many pieces as you would like. Players also have significant influence regarding how fast the draw deck is depleted, and can speed up or slow down the game according to their strategy.

Web of Power plays fairly quickly, keeps all players engaged, and distills area-control down to its most interesting elements. It's a winning combination.

KUK (3.5): I just don't get this game.  I have played this many times, sadly more than I've played some of my favorite games, to try and figure out why people like this.  

I am not a big fan of drafting/set collection games.  There are some real choices as to when you switch from houses to Providences, but you only get these choices if you can get certain cards at the right time.  It gets frustrating and exhausting if you are getting crap draws and others are getting the cards that they need. 

China (2.5): I just played China.  It had been a while since I'd played KUK and I forgot what a boring soulless game this is.  Place some pieces on the board whenever you can.  Whereas before it was frustrating not getting the cards you need, now it is easy to get wild card combos.  It is a no brainer, go for the wild card option when available.  Zzzzzzz.  Why bother including cards at this point?  The scoring mechanic is cool, but not enough to make it something that I get excited about.

The design feels very clean and elegant, but I feel like I'm missing a fundamental interaction between cities and emissaries--I understand every piece of this game, but not how they all go in together.

There's big-time scoring differences here between China and Web of Power, and I *think* I like China better. Other than the scoring, the games are almost identical in my mind.  I do like the 'look' of China better, so it gets the better score.

*Update* - definitely like China better.  I prefer the one-time scoring instead of Web's 2x, it's nice to have three cards out to see.  And I like the map better, too.  It just seems to play smoother.  Clear winner.

I like the original name better, Kardinal & König.  I like the original game better, too -- far, far better than "China" which is based on Kardinal & König but omits the crucial detail of having a first half where only the provinces score and then a second half where provinces, advisors, and chains all score.  What makes this game so good is how you need to do a certain amount of set-up work during the first half that doesn't score anything until the end.

A fast game. Just slightly more than a filler game.  Play is pretty straight forward and careful play is usually rewarded.  One thing that troubles me is the reluctance for player to break open a new country.  It seems like every game ends with several countries wide open.

Still given the short playing time, we still play it quite a bit.

Played 15+ times. This is a great game.  It's a quick game of religious domination.  I prefer to play with fewer players (3) because you have more control over the outcome. With 5 players the action can seem pretty chaotic. 2010/01/15 Expansion owned: Kardinal & König: Der Vatikan

RATING: 6.5
Decent game, a bit dry for my taste. 

Basically it is a simple land-grab game in which you have to grab optimal position based on the moves your opponents have made, limited by the two cards in your hand.

Highly tactical, but no strategy. Forces you to adapt to every turn. Will become better with extensive replay but won't hit that level in our group.

On the plus side: it really lasts only 40 minutes or so, so it is a nice quick game in between something else.

This feels marginally more enjoyable than Chine, for reasons I can't quite put my finger on. 

Let's be clear; they're VERY similar, but WoP seems to me to be a little more interesting. Perhaps it's the timing of the scoring being caused by the deck running out each time, means that the priorities shift subtly as the game progresses.

I'm a little put of by how much chaos there still is, by how much it relies on the players to keep it close, and mostly by how players can benefit by working together to increase the value of their emissaries. (I might just be a little bitter on that last point)

Next to El Grande, this is on second place in my all time top 10 games list!

Laying out your plans, only to be stopped by some unpredicted move of one of your opponents, and immediately changing your plans, that's the what Web of Power (Kardinaal en Koning) is about!

So frustrating, and still so demanding for your brains!

We usually play a game of Web of Power near the end of our game nights,as it plays rather fast.

Played 40+ times. Quick. 20 minutes with experience players. 40 minutes for a super slow game. Tension. Group evolved through several strategies. Won with no advisors several times. Played with 3, 4, and 5 players. Don't really care too much for it with 5 players. I think I like it best with 3, though really like it with 4 too. Quick. Tense. Don't play the cards you get but plan ahead and play for the cards you are going to get. At first we played with just what we drew and it was ok, but once you start planning, then it's awesome, you rarely don't have doubles and little whining about what was drawn.
There's still some more to learn but I think we've explored this game enough with the amount of plays. England still rarely opens up with 3 players though. Still eager to play but definately want to try other great games.

A fairly brisk place-to-form scoring chains/influence zones game that fails to hold my interest due to being at once both too-tactical-thinky (lots of AP potential) and too random (due to the card restrictions).

Although the scoring feels kind of clunky nowadays, Web Of Power stood the test of time very well. So well in fact, that a third new iteration (Han) is forthcoming.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Web of Power is the predecessor of China. Both these Schacht games share similar but not identical game play. The asymmetric board in Web of Power makes this game more  cut throat and compelling without altering the sequence of play. At the heart of the game is a two-tiered area majority control system. In the first tier, players place cloisters to gain a simple majority in each region. The second tier revolves around forming an alliance between two adjacent regions by placing a majority of advisors in each of the two regions. However, the number of cloisters placed by the majority owner in each region will determine the total number of advisors allowed in each region. This is a subtle yet crucial link between the two-tiered system.

The agonizing twist in the game comes from how points are scored. Scores depend not only on your own pieces, but also pieces from other players. Hence, a simple majority of your own pieces will not score many points. Conversely a region that faces fierce competition for majority ownership will yield lots of points. So, should one play it safe and get a few points from a poorly contested region, or should one wade into a bloody territorial battle where one winner takes home the crown?

Definitely one of Schacht's finest (Coloretto is one other)

RATING: 6.5
This game reminds me of a combination of Ticket to Ride and Maharaja.  Of course it pre-dates them both by years, but that's the frame of reference I have to work with.  It seems faster and more optimized than Maharaja, but it didn't grab me quite as much.  Maharaja belongs to me, and it's a prettier game, but those would be petty reasons, so maybe its because Maharaja has a more chaotic and dynamic feel.  Hopefully my feelings will solidify with additional plays.

I just played the game again at EuroQuest, and I think I liked it pretty well.  Its still not a game that sits up and screams, but I'm glad I enjoyed it, since I picked up a cheap copy of China a while back.

An area influence game with some very interesting scoring mechanisms, but my appreciation of the game has decreased with repeated plays as it becomes more apparent that one's decisions are generally obvious and dictated by the current situation on the board- so basically a game without many interesting choices. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
One of my favorite things about this game is the depth of strategy involved, paired with its short length of time.  I don't mind longer, deeper games, but it's nice to come across a game that mixes so many tough choices into a 30-minute play time.  The scoring rules are interesting, and guarantee that no two games will ever play out exactly the same, and the combination of the territorial control with the way that the advisers work makes for some very, VERY tough choices in the game.

I'm a bit humbled by the fact that I nearly won the first game, without having a clue what I was doing for the first half of it, but can't even come close when I try to use a strategy.  As it is, though, it's a fast-playing, card-driven area control game, and it hits the sweet spot with all three things.

Initial play of Web of Power has me kind of mystified in regards to its popularity, as well as its highly sought after status.  It is by no means a bad game, but I'm not really sure if it has the depth that many have claimed.  One thing that doesn't sit well with me is how the advisors seem to be too overpowered in comparison to the other two scoring methods, so much so that it propelled someone to a win by at least 10 points.  Definitely warrants more plays, will reassess again in the near future.

Love this game.  A 30-40 minute game packed with decisions.  Beautiful board and components too.

I just suck at this game, but it does not make the game bad, of course. I just cannot put my finger on the actual reason I detest this game.

One of the games I have played the most, probably around 50 times plus. I like the simplicity and the fact that its not too long. Usually plays in around 40  mins - a classic.

A two players tactical card game. The game comes with 6 different factions and many neutral cards. The artwork is great on most cards. The 6 factions are not balanced but you can always make your own decks. The rulebook is poorly written, I had to check Bgg for answers. Gameplay is quite interesting. I must check the drafting part sometime.

Got it because it was cheap. Might play it, might just gift it for the holidays. Problem with this game is that I own Summoner Wars.

Played a couple of rounds to see what it is like. I am going to be getting rid of this game because there is no reason to play this over summoner wars.

Play with 20 card decks removing some considerably powerful units to provide a balance game.

When black die cannot be rolled?
When a creature is exhausted.
When a creature is targeted by Ranged Attack.

Ranged attack cannot target adjacent cards.

Art is amazing, and game is pretty good - tactical minatures battle with cards instead of figures to paint. Lots of options to customise.

Downsides, awful rule book and dark deck is pretty unbeatable, others seem relatively balanced though.

Plus my kickstarter copy was messed up, missing card and missing expansion :(

I love Magic: the Gathering! However, I will never own or play that game beyond the most casual of settings, simply because I could never afford feeding the completionist hidden within.

That's why I was drawn to Berserk, originally a CCG in Russia. However, on the international market it's been marketed and released as a standalone game.

Each player chooses a faction (or mix of factions) and builds his army from a predetermined number of summoning points. Once both players have made their decisions, the resulting cards are placed on the battlefield according to each player's desire.

No mana. No guessing whether a particular card is going to show up or not. Everything is on the battle field from the beginning of the game. Then — battle to the death!

While this is certainly no Magic clone or replacement, it is a fantastic head-to-head game which shares many game play aspects with Magic and other CCGs, but without being a CCG itself.

Great game! Fantastic artwork!

RATING: 3
Card based lite war game - your troops are the cards which operate within a grid as in Summoner Wars.

Awful rules book - lots of things not well explained - needs many more diagrams and examples. Also some poor card wording - vague and open to interpretation - the FAQ is a must.

Game play is igyg with all information visible - uncertainty is provided by the dice. This game is all about the pregame (meta game) deck building and army selection. Actual play is just arithmetic - meh.

Ok art. Good card stock.

KS follow up was terrible - I got my game months after it was generally available from local retail - not worth the wait.

Terrible game. Rules are incomprehensible, the writing on cards are inconsistent, some of them are miscut. Gameplay-wise its very rock-paper-scissors with most games already decided by the choice of cards at the start of the game rather than playing the game. Game is also very unbalanced with certain cards being must-haves in certain factions limiting deckbuild potentials.

Based on the popular Russian card collecting game. This version includes 6 different playable factions as well as cards that can be used with more than one group. Two hard playing boards included as well as damage and poison tokens. Unique dice with pictures for use with combat. Overall a good dueling two player .

In the beginning I didn't liked the game for some reason, but we gave it an second chance and we discovered that the game is more capable than it seems at first sight.

When you know the factions and mix the decks the hole thing becomes more advanced and challenging. Give it a chance and explore the game a little more. 
At this moment, I like it as much I like Summoner Wars.

I play this as a solitaire timekiller. I'd never play it as a two-player game, since some of the cards are pretty broken. The mechanic of moving cards on a grid reminds me of Anachronism, although the latter is a far better game.

I'd never heard of this game at all. However, after playing it, I could see the draw from a collectors stand point of building a deck to play against someone else. I doubt though, unless it just happens that someone insists we play, that I'll ever play this one again. Very average for me.

I supported this game on kickstarter and was very disappointed. The game has potential and I like that style of game - but the rulebook (and BGG forums) provide a shaky set of rules at best. The comic strip they provided is inconsistent with the rules and covers just part of the game, the language on the cards is inconsistent and confusing and the system is really clanky (some abilities have little cryptic symbols you have to look up, some have ad-hoc rules ('once per game' 'twice per turn')). Overall, the game seems to require that you build a coherent system of rules instead of providing it, which is a shame and makes me doubt the playtesting and balance of the factions.

This game doesn't get the recognition it  deserves, Very nice artwork on the whole product, from the box to the player boards and the cards. Plenty of variety with the various factions and lots of diversity in the cards abilities. We found the rules to be a real challenge, badly translated from Russian. But with the help of a rewritten rulebook on bgg we were able to enjoy this games features and effects in a short space of time.If you like fantasy style games with various mythical races who have lots of special abilities, designed for battle. You'll like this.Played correctly, its very enjoyable.

31-08-2014. Rated after 1 play. Summoner Wars with a twist. Apparently a russian game that predates summoner wars. That it's been unavailable in English is unfortunate, the game now feels very similar to something we already have seen.

I think I like Berserk. The artwork is great. The card-size is good. The game very much plays like Summoner Wars, you move and attack with cards symbolizing creatures. But Berserk features drafted armies and therefore you can influence the setup, which is predetermined in SW. 

SW didn't do it for me, because I felt constrained by the setup and the -to me- ugly design. I like Berserk better on those parts, but I think the gameplay might be too similar to SW, and maybe even a little more random.

I should really try to play this more. It remains promising.

As a Works bargain (£10 - £12) pretty darn good - a lot of play in the box, pretty card art and thick stock, very easy to pick up and play, clearly plenty scope for customisation. Seems likely that other than those not-inconsiderable plusses, is not as good a game as Summer Wars, Mage Wars, or indeed Magic. Worth picking up for a tenner though.

I really do love this game. I really like the idea of using cards as units that move around on a physical board in relation to each other. This is the game I wanted Summoner Wars to be. It works exactly like I want it to, and I really love how combos and synergy emerge out of the cards. I love how this game has two levels of customization. First the decks can be customized, but then each game the units deployed are customized out of the available options. The different units interact well together. The game comes with six decks, and only half the cards are available each game. Plus, there are several neutral and dual faction cards included to allow for customization options. This means that there is a ton of replayblitity out of the box. The only negative is that the game has a fairly terrible rule book, and reading the official FAQ is almost mandatory. Despite the rule issues, this game is wonderful and one I can not say enough good things about.

:) Phenomenal Art Work
:) Cool no drawing cards gameplay
:) Powerful units feel powerful
:) Dice rolling done right. Far less luck than say summoner wars

:!block: - Some claim the game is unplayable with the rulebook. It's not good, but that's an overstatement. I common theme on bgg about board games.

:soblue: Seems unlikely we'll get more cards
:soblue: Too many kickstarter exclusives, which was a dumb move on their part. 
:soblue: Will take a bit to get use to the different ranged attacks and iconography 
:soblue: Pre built decks are not balanced against each other. Not an issue once you deck build.

Excellent game, lots of replayability right out of the box. Gorgeous artwork, very good component quality.

Really like how the deckbuilding is done (you draw half of a faction and get a point buy from those cards). So this means you will have to deal with whatever is dealt to you and though this introduces more variability I think it is a great way of 'forcing' you to try other (perhaps suprising effective) strategies as well.

Gameplay itself is pretty straightforward for anyone who has played Summoner Wars, Magic the Gathering, Mage Wars or that kind of games: use the ability of your creatures the best as you can. If you like any of those games do have a look at this one as well.

Two main drawbacks:
- in our demo, from deployment on it seemed already clear who would win. So if matchups are uneven, game itself might not be as exciting. But we also played with 'half the units' so normally the 'in game' tactics will be more important compared to the drafting as you simply have more in-game options to mitigate any drafting mistakes.
- units either do something but leave themselves wide open or do nothing and 'hope for the best'. Somehow that felt limited, but maybe we're simply still exploring the best strategies.

Very eager to play this again, quite impressed by this game.

[FEB14] Played this a couple of times more, this time with 'full' decks. As I only own 1 set, there sadly is no real deckbuilding part, though the MtG player in me would definitely have appreciated that. The drafting and deploying part is the best part of the game, gameplay itself is tactical maneuvering akin to Summoner Wars. However, unlike Summoner Wars or Mage Wars, there is no changing battlefield: what you have is (usually) all you get. The result is that it usually is quite clear who has the advantage from the start, the surprise wins coming from dice rolling instead of smart stacking of a deck or smart playing of cards.

All in all I still quite like the game, as setup time is really short, artwork is really a big plus and any games are quite fast, allowing for a quick re-match. Both Summoner Wars and Mage Wars do take more time, and Berserk is no money-pit as MtG is. For me it is the perfect 2 person quick tactical filler.

Rulebook is atrocious though. Sometimes info is just plain missing and no non-cyrillic errata is to be found! Come on Hobby World, if you are any serious about becoming an international game publisher, put some decent rules out and/or have them uploaded on BGG.

Has quite a few interesting things going for it, but it's hindered by wretched documentation and a ton of imbalances. The drafting variant largely negates the latter problem though, so this is the only way I play anymore.

First Impression:
Summoner Wars meets Magic, Russian Style.

The game is tactical at its heart, with a bit of deckbuilding and pre-combat hand management. The various races and abilities make this game extremelly replayable, and the base mechanisms are tactical and fun. There are preset decks, but deckbuilding (from available cards) is far superior. The variety has meaningfull and actual impact on the mechanics and feeling of the game, and this is a great accomplishment. The artwork is generally great.

The preset races vary wildly in strenght, as some of them have extreme synergies that can easily beat those that don't. Some games can drag too long, depending on the race combinations. The rulesbook is horrible and full of gaps. No, it's worse than that actually, you definately need the forums to play the game correctly.

Overall, it's a fun system that creates interesting battles. I'd play it again gladly, but I feel angry about the half-baked english rules.

Need to play again (I don't want to rate based off of what I've played so far). The first play-through was a little rough: the game is simple, but there are a lot of terms that are important to understand (codex in the rulebook). It seems that this is a slightly more complex game than it appears to be, and the strategy is not quite as obvious as most games like it (part of this may have to do with lack of understanding the rules by the rulebook, and I consider myself good at teaching myself games). After playing it, I read the rules again, and a lot more clicked, so hopefully another play will shed some more light!

Sleeved.

I have 1st edition. 2nd edition is not a block game. That should tell you plenty.

The British have to flip their units when they fire and again when they melee. It's not too hard to memorize where they are.

Meanwhile, here comes a group of zulu warriors. Hey, I can't tell if there is 3 of them or 60 of them until they get in my face and try to kill me. Seem absurd? Yep.

The game play is kind of fun, though, and while I am willing to let a lot slide in historical simulation on block games, the amount of suspended belief in this one crosses the threshold. It's more like they wanted a block game first and a theme as an afterthought. Take away the blocks, and I'm not sure how much you can tell it from a game like Zulus on the Ramparts!, or why you even need a 2nd player.

RATING: 6.5
Like all their designs. The game system is simple. Reminds me lots about the first few AH games, like Victory in the Pacific. 

The system works and the scenario is fun. However. The Zulus do seem to have certain strategy at bunching up. The British would just have to dish out punishing firepower everytime they could volley fire. And holding onto the walls are a must. 

The game is beautiful but the LOS issues do need abit of walk thru before your first game. 

A bucket of dice game. Use the optional rules. It perhaps balance the game slightly. 

Overall, a reasonable beginner wargame.

One of those very good obscure games that you find once in a while.
Seems a liiittle unbalanced in favor of the Zulu warriors. But I guess it's supposed to be like that.

Un par de partidas no registradas.

- Demasiado simple.

- No se detalla demasiado la batalla (personajes clave sobre todo). Tiene excesivamente poco chrome.

- A la segunda partida ya te resulta repetitivo.

- En la parte positiva, es bueno para jugar con alguien no-wargamer o como iniciación.

Game was published with many ambiguous rules. The LOS rules are entirely incomprehensible but thankfully a player has forced the designers to clarify by publishing and posting his own matrix here on BGG. It ought to be on the Worthington Games site and they ought to be very embarrassed it's not.

Thought I'd like this more than I did :(

Like the theme, map is a bit quirky but the main problem seems to be the imbalance in victory conditions, not sure how you can win with the Brits, but maybe that's the point?

An epic siege. The British have yet to survive, but it is a blast to die trying.

RATING: 7
First impressions were that it was awkward in spots - tracking overall Zulu casualties, melee results, and firing ranges are not as clean as one would hope or get from Columbia, the map has some minor usability issues, and the die-rolling seems a touch excessive. But, it does give a great feel for the battle. The British feel like they are in a shooting gallery for the first turn or two, but then things get more and more desperate. And it works as a game too, presents the players with interesting, meaningful, and difficult choices. Seems like it might be a low-ceiling game (10-15 plays?), but really, that didn't bug me. I enjoyed it and look forward to playing again, and was happy with my purchase. With just a little cleanup of some of the rough bits, this might rate an 8. I was actually more impressed with VC than with a recent play of Columbia's 1812, so I think VC makes up for some of the awkwardness with overall tension. 1812 is probably the better game from a long-run perspective, though.

RATING: 8
Superb, simple little game on this classic defensive action. Not sure the mechanics cover the reality in all its glory, but the buckets of dice give a suitable feel to the mayhem, and the heavy dose of luck eased by a few critical decisions (tending the wounded, evacuating the hospital) and important timing. Might have been improved with a few events/cards, but a blast to play - although hard to win as the British.

A really interesting scenario with some good small-scale fighting that's really marred only by a poorly implemented 3/4 perspective map that hurts more than it helps.  I don't think this is as good as the Columbia games but nonetheless it's well worth playing and is actually somewhat simpler to play and manage for the newbie.  I'd like to try it again with the CRTs for more detail.  Go for the water cart!

Fun and atmospheric, this "light" wargame accurately reflects the tension of the actual battle. Board is only on light cardstock but looks good in play. LOTS of dice rolling which may put some non-wargamers off, but finely balanced gameplay makes for fun up to the last turn. Worthington's customer commitment and interesting upcoming games make it a company to watch for the future.

Cool siege/defense contest, the board layout and fog of war work well...I was skeptical about the fog of war aspect with this but it really works.  Brits are up against it the whole time....not surprising.  The leader movement and special abilities are cool. You know the Hospital is going to burn down, but how much effort do you put into the rearguard action....looking forward to further plays.

RATING: 7
A solid, asymmetrical block wargame with a lot (and I mean a LOT) of dice rolling.   The map is a bit weird looking, and there was some question over what walls are technically walls or not.  The point scoring and game balance seem to work out well - our game came down to the wire despite the hospital burning down quickly.   I like this game for the unique theme and simplicity of the system.   Yeah, it's just a dice-chucker, but it felt like something different.   I can't imagine it would see more than 10 plays, but that's not that uncommon for something like this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Decent, fast-playing block game. I'll have to give it more plays to formulate a real opinion and rating. 

I will say that I'm not crazy about the artwork. The isometric map doesn't bother me as it does some folks (though it is an odd choice), but the unit stickers are not good. The actual art portion is far too small and blurry. Symbols, icons, almost anything would have been better. I'm kind of surprised they went to print this way. Still, the blocks are perfectly functional and this aspect doesn't spoil my enjoyment of the game (much).

UPDATE: I had quite a bit of fun with this one, but the scale doesn't work for me. Turns are 12 hours, yet units can only move a very short distance, not even able to cross the inside of the compound in 24 hours. From a purely gameplay perspective it's pretty good, although I thought it went on a bit too long.

Here's a fun little game.  A good intro to block gaming.  Line-of-sight is the only tricky part.

RATING: 3
I wanted to like this game, and have played several times, but the basic structure is so flawed that it would require a major overhaul to fix.  Do the math: 1) The Zulus fire a total of 80 "Random Fire" dice into the compound over the course of the game.  With even average results (assuming there are no targets in the Water Cart area, where the odds go up), that would wipe out 13 SPs of British (End of game, right there, really--add a few melees to complete the task).  2) The hospital is all but guaranteed to burn down (fire starts on anything but a 1, rolled every turn after the Zulu makes first attack on it, no need to repeat the attempt).  If the hospital burns down, the Zulus bag the second highest victory point objective in the lists (6 VPs out of a needed 14 to win) for doing virtually nothing.  If you like to overhaul games, this is a good one to start with. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A very nice light asymmetric block wargame. Probably the best asymmetric game I have played. Sides are totally different: Every unit point is valuable to high fire power British whereas close combat relying Zulus have strength in numbers. Game itself is somewhat puzzle-like. Zulu player must try to figure out a way to break British defence whereas British must do everything to prevent this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great game. Exciting stuff. The game throws you right into the action and maintains the tension right through. This game would be a lot less fun without the blocks though. The blocks give players a chance to feint and bluff their opponent, and is almost de rigueur for the Zulu player. He has to keep the British player guessing or he'll find British concentrated firepower gunning down his men. The theming is also great. If you're playing the British, you'd almost want to start singing "Men of Harlech". Needs a better rulebook, though, and download the LOS file on BGG.

RATING: 7
An interesting scenario pitting a horde of low-powered units (Zulu) against a severely-limited number of dispersed, high-powered units (Brits).  No matter how well the Brits roll, though, some Zulu are bound to slip through.

It's certainly a good game, but I can't help feeling after an initial play that this would be much better suited to a computer implementation.  For 1-2 hours the Brits are constantly rolling dozens of dice, while the Zulu are constantly "making change".  Implemented at wargameroom.com the whole battle could be over and done in 15-20 minutes.

Acquired May 09 - Quick light game of survival versus the zulu hordes.  Although it's hard not to play and think of the senseless waste of human life.  initial rating 7/10.  Seems too hard on the British.  I look forward to a few 2-player games and see how long they can hold out for.

Another of the battles that interest me, and worthington have done a fine job making a cool and enjoyable few hours at rorke's drift

Worthington fuked me off in the end. I was there at the start buying all their 1st ed stuff. Then as soon as they made a few quid, they began making better editions and even amalgamating games in the catalogue. Thus Leaving my copies pale in comparison, with no update kits or anything for the guys that put them in the position to make these new copies.
Much like Sky and Talk Talk, it was all about getting new customers and fuck the ones they already had.

Victoria Cross now has a much nicer edition

RATING: 4
Block wargame covering the battle of Rorke's Drift during the Anglo-Zulu War. In principle a good idea for a game, although the fog of war provided by the blocks seems a bit awkward here. The map, while interesting because of its novel use of graphics, leaves a bit to be desired in terms of usability. But the big disappoint for me is that the balance seems to be skewed in the Zulu's favor and I have difficulty seeing the British win against a competent Zulu player.

VC is a neat little block game that provides great atmosphere, each turn is tense.  On the down side, I think that the game is a bit like a tactical puzzle that could lose its replay value once "solved".  It would have been nice to see better company support, as the game really needs the LOS chart here on the Geek, and some of the errata points are key.  A few scenarios also would have been nice, but those points aside, I like this game quite a bit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Easy to get into and a lot of fun to play.  The blocks allow both players to feint and thrust and the game system provides a good historical feel.  There are strategies available for both sides in how to attack and defend the compound - so far I have found no perfect approach.  A good choice for introducing someone to wargaming. (which I have done with it)  The more experienced player should take the British and he needs to have an actual plan if he wants to successfully defend the camp.

Because there are a couple different ways for the Zulus to acquire enough points for a victory, experienced play takes on a sense of bluff and counterbluff - is he pursuing the 'standard' opening or is that feint against the kraal & final redoubt actually a strike for the game? The fog of war is thus much more important once you're familiar with how to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
An unusual war game where each side plays a totally different game. The Zulus have lots of men but crappy attacks (hits on a 6), which the British have few men but ranged attacks (and hits on 4-6 generally). The map was nice and allowed for attacks on many different fronts. For a dice game it ran a little too long, but overall I think its one of the more interesting games I've played recently.

Initial impression.  While playing the Zulu's was fun, I was left wondering what the Brits are supposed to do to win.  As the Zulu's you are handed a large heavy hammer and told to bash the Brits.  As the Brits, you seem screwed.  Maybe I am missing something.  I'd be willing to try again.  Cool theme and I am hoping we missed something.

A nice quick playing system and some smart, unique ideas, but it is very repetetive, and the victory conditions are harsh on the Brits. Of course the Brits should get wiped, but the need to defend so many areas seems to dilute any real defensive opportunity. Maybe I just didn't get a handle on a decent strategy.

Kind of a throwback to the mid 70s when Avalon Hill was making some fun fast playing wargames you could toss down and play in 2 hours. A great game for when you need that wargame fix and don't have 4 hours to play something. Not a big fan of the map but the game play is a lot of fun.

After opening the box and reading the rules, I wasn't sure what to expect (especially since I didn't think the game would "click" with my two oldest sons, whom I was playing against over the holiday break), so I set it up with more than a little hesitation the next day.  Wow!  It all came together beautifully.  The boys loved it, I loved it, and we had a great time playing it.  My only gripes would be that there is a huge amount of dice rolling, and with the block mix supplied it's difficult to create what visually appears to be a huge mass of Zulus -- instead there is something close to block parity (note:  not strength parity, just the number of blocks) at the beginning of the game.

I love this game. It reflects accurately the tension lived by British soldiers defending a position against thousands of zulu warriors. Every meter, every strenght point is a worth for the British. Zulu player fight against time. Aparently impossible to win for British I beleive a set of right tactical decissions  makes British a potential winner, so choose your options carefully. As Zulu player just through your herds against British and take advantage of your unlimited men power. Hospital should be the first goal to burn it down. Take into account the movement limitations and that melee combat is only poossible to attack with up to 8 SP unless attacking from other areas. Also, think about stacking limitation inside fortification and beware the voley firing from British player. Simple mechanics, for a really great game. 2-3 hours for a complete match, no more tha half an hour to start playing your first try. A must have

[1 play] Time will tell if I crave this game or not, but for now I'll happily play again to explore it further. It does appear that the Brits are really up against it in terms of victory conditions. While I suppose that's important thematically, it may limit viable strategies (should the British player ever end bother to try to forestall the burning of the hospital?) which could in turn make the play more scripted. Not a game breaker necessarily, but something to watch.

Fog of war element is subtle, but interesting. Play is definitely mostly tactical round to round, with decisions being sort of obvious - akin to the level of Battle Cry or M'44 in that your best move is often clear.

Most recent play 6/1/11 with Garrett.

This is a grand game, lots of fun, but, very bloody too. The player aids here on BGG are helpful and make the game move much smoother. Odd thing is I bought the second version first, then found a copy of this version. I'm glad I did. I really like this game, it ties in very well to the movie Zulu and has some great tension in playing it. Now the British are more fun, but, more likely to lose. I like the blocks, but, I do wonder about the Zulu blocks. The Zulus could have 5 blocks in 1 area and they could be anywhere from 5-50 strength points. I know that this represents the Zulus trying to use the terrain to avoid the British guns, which they did in the actual battle, but, it does feel a little clunky. Of course being a block game I do not know how to get around that, perhaps a dot or mark on the outside of that block to show either a large number or small number of Zulus with that block. The map is the most confusing as it is a 3/4 view that looks good, but, LOS can be confusing. There is a file here on BGG that corrects that. Overall, this is a fun game that is a pleasure to play on the Battle of Rorke's Drift.

I love the unique map, and I especially enjoy the struggle of suppressing panic, managing the troops, and combating the never-ending tide of Zulu warriors. Of course, playing the mass of Zulus is a blast too. However, a Zulu commander can easily get lulled into a false sense of superiority with his greater numbers. A cool-headed British commander can quickly pull the table out from under the Zulu battle plan.

The fight at this outpost is considered to be one of militay history's ultimate defenses.

(ported over from my Victoria Cross II comments)

The level of detail depicted in this colonial struggle is partly what makes the game fun: the hospital fire, the walking wounded, the water cart, the rooftop sharpshooters, etc.   Rolling 20+ dice all at once (our record = 45 dice!) also doesn't hurt.

It's a marvel of engineering that both sides can feel desperate and outclassed: the British jump from wall to wall inside their diminishing defensive perimeter as each death takes its toll, and the Zulus suffer hundreds upon hundreds of casualties in the hope that a few proud warriors can punch through and take out the occupying Brits in a key combat zone.  If tension were the foremost metric of quality in simulation wargaming, Victoria Cross would get high marks indeed.

Despite these positives, there are drawbacks to the game.  Rorke's Drift is not a scenario that warrants frequent play, because it can feel overly repetitious and - for its weight class - occasionally goes longer than it should.  There may also be an ideal British setup, which could limit the fun. Although I suppose ferreting out this "best" setup is half the challenge.

So yes, you should buy and enjoy Victoria Cross.  Whether the game deserves more than 3-4 plays per year is up to you.

Great game, easily learned. However, I've only played it solo - I'm not sure there's much of a game for a British player in a two-player game, or much of a challenge for the Zulu player! Solo, it's perfect, the rules work flawlessly to keep the Brits constantly in panic! I've played about 10 solo games - and very nearly won once!

Block system gives very nice fog of war making it a challange for both sides.  However, afer a few plays, optimal strategies for both sides develop - the rest is down to chance.  Board is a bit "wonky" trying to depict 3D concepts in 2D.  Still a fun game to play.

An interesting block game, based on a battle I had never heard of until discovering this game on BGG. This game has been made much easier thanks to the fire table created by Walt Mulder.

[b]"ZULUS! FAWSANDS OF 'EM."[/b]

This is a great block wargame, recreating the famous battle of Rorke's Drift, Jan 22nd, 1879.
100 stout-hearted British soldiers defended the small mission station in Natal - near the Buffalo river - from 4000+ knobkerry (staff-club) and ixwa (short handled spear, named for the noise it makes exiting a wound) wielding zulus.
Eleven VCs were awarded for the courage and determination displayed by the British regiment.
Stirring stuff.

[b]GAME-ENHANCING PROJECT:[/b]
My long-cherished project was to build the scenery of Rorke's Drfit in 15mm on a MDF board - same dimensions as the card gameboard - for the blocks to be placed around. A diorama version of the Worthington game, still using their rules, obviously. Took a year to complete; mainly in collecting the resin pieces. Sawing, painting, hot-glueing everything took only 2 days. Completed 19/03/09. Huzzah!

RATING: 5
A very fun game that can be played in under an hour.  It gives the appearance of many strategies being available, but I'm not sure what exactly they would be; that is, the first few times I played, it seemed there were several possibilities for victory, but I don't really know any coherent way of playing.  The special character tokens are interesting, though they are under-utilized, at least in my sessions.  I really like being able to play several 1 valued tiles in order to complete the location and place the next.  

I got my copy signed by Reiner Knizia at Origins '06.

If you think of every stereotype you have ever heard about Reiner Knizia's games, then you already have a very good knowledge of King's Gate. It's certainly an enjoyable game, but nothing stellar. As well, all the good qualities of King's Gate are already present in a large number of far better Knizia games, so unless you're a Knizia kultist, there's really no need to pick this one up. The art on the individual tiles is quite nice; the finished city, however, looks like one of those really difficult jigsaw puzzles.

Having played Carcassonne many times, I found this a nice change in tile laying games.  A little variation in the tiles you can play, the ability to play multiple tiles at key points, and being able to replace your opponents tiles makes this a nice quite game with some fun competition.

Pretty straightforward game of tile-laying to surround a city.  Typical Knizia where players all have the same tiles, just get numbers and have to make the best of them.  Nothing fantastic, but it was fun and would probably be a bit better with 4 players.

RATING: 5
The game was alright, but it seemed like everything boiled down to who could finish off the most tiles, thus being able to decide the placement of the next tile.  Any other game play was completely overshadowed by this aspect of the game.  Maybe with some sort of tweak to that rule, the game wouldn't suck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Components are artistically distracting to look at (Fantasy Flight tends toward beautiful artwork which is continued here but it is too much for the pieces and I find them distracting) but the game mechanic is intriguing.  A rare example of FF with a game where mechanic is better than theme.

RATING: 6
The game itself is very clever and you can fly ahead one minute but be clawed back to be beaten. Your tiles influence the locations in the city and win points and special Characters along the way. My only gripe is that the artwork is very dark and it is hard to see anything once the board is complete - looks like a Magic Eye Puzzle. Lighter tones would have been better. 1 Play.

Bottom-shelf Knizia...sorry, everything the man touches is _not_ gold and this squarely falls at the bottom of the pile.  Basically an advanced (and convuluted) variant of the much better Samurai with a bogus fantasy theme.  Some possibly interesting mechanics (last tile played loses ties but places next district, "hostile" districts allowing tiles to be stacked) but ultimately a rather lukewarm and boring game.  It's just one of those games that you play and think "why should I bother".  I'm also getting tired of FFG products where you just have to remember special conditions and abilities that aren't printed on the components or at least on a reference sheet. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fast lighter strategy game. We played with one wrong rule which gave me a landslide victory but it still looks like an excellent game. For a quick game its a lot of fun and still requires some level of strategy to win. No doubt my brilliant play had a lot to do with the victory. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Ok played this again with the correct rules and lost. But to be honest there was some collusion. My opinion holds this is a excellent filler game, coming in around 30 miniutes.

RATING: 6
Interesting.  It's the bastard love-child of Knizia's Samurai and Citadels with a dash of Carcassonne flavor thrown in.  I like that you work on one objective at a time ... although placement definitely has an impact on future rounds as well.

One observation:  30 minutes?  Our first game took a hair over two hours ... who's wrong, them or us?  Definitely worthy of another play.  *Update* second game, three players took about an hour.  Could probably shave another 15 - 20 mins with experience which is more appropriate.

This one is a strategy winner.  It is always fun to try to decide whether to max out with one tile or play a bunch...or try to get in the last tile each time.  Fun!  I really like the 2 player version where each takes two sets of tiles.  Even more strategy...trying to max out both.

Players visit ten sites in order. The sites are made up of two playing cards placed together on the table. Players play from their own deck of 22 cards and try and build the highest influence on that site. When the site is surrounded by cards, points are awarded to everyone but the last placed player.  A pleasant game, very reminiscent of Knizia&#039;s &quot;Samurai&quot; boardgame. Remember to bring a large table - why are these cards full size?

This is a fine surround-and-control game.  Knizia did it much better with Samurai, but this one has its moments, and is certainly different.  My favorite parts: each place you surround has some differences, AND the game board is different every time.  Best with all 4 players, I think.

RATING: 7
A great idea and LOTS of replayability.  The board can be a little busy and easily bumped, but that's just nitpicking.  The main thing is the game is a little too abstract and often whomever gets ahead early gets "dragoned" and somebody else leaps into the lead, so save your good stuff till about 2/3 into the game.  I do like how the points are given out and who places the next tile which is very important.

Excellent game, amazing for the price.  This is one of the best 2 player games I have ever played and ranks up there with Attika and Hacienda for 2 player fun, actually above Attika and potentially above Hacienda.  Great game mechanics, a great challenge.  If you wish to invest the metal capacity can become a very challenging game as each player has the same resources to work with and 'tile counting' can mean all the difference.  A huge amount of strategy for fairly simple rules.  Just knocked a mark off this one after playing 3 player.  It's just not the same, you don't even get to get to all the land locations.

I avoided King's Gate for a couple years because it's clearly related to the rather uninspiring Samurai.  Too bad for me; it's a good game, and I like it much better than Samurai.  My preference would be stronger yet if Samurai weren't so beatiful or if King's Gate weren't so vomitesque.  Recommended for fans of Auf Heller/Kingdoms and Quandary/Flinke Pinke/Thor/Loco.

I first played this on Feb 20th 2007.  Playing this game was a bit dissapointing.  I'm not sure if I can put my finger on it exactly.  I thought there would be more strategy in it.  It seemed that lady luck played more into it than I expected as well.  I felt like I was playing along for the ride as well.  When you are the person to close out a building, it seems to be a bit unfair how you can decide where the next building goes.  I did in fact finish 3 buildings of 9 myself, however it just didn't seem right.  With that said, this game was still fun and enjoyable, just seemed to have more potential.  It's worth a game play or two.

RATING: 6
King's Gate is a less elogant, more fiddly version of Samurai with lots of special powers going on and fiddly little exceptions littered about.  It doesn't really work well with two, but for three or four is OK.  This game is pretty clearly a protoype version of Samurai as it's a bit too chaotic and unrefined.  The city tiles also hurt my eyes to look at.

RATING: 3.4
Really, not a bad game in the end.  Yes, the art gets in the way.  It's not as bad as the photos make it, but it's still nasty.I do enjoy the game play though.  It's similar to "Samurai", but it avoids the whole "stop the next player" stuff.  The special districts, tiles and characters actually aren't that overwhelming.It has an enjoyable length and lots of meaningful decisions.  Still though, it wasn't *great*.May08: Yea, more plays made it worse instead of better.  Graphics are really bugging me. And controlling where the next location was just way too powerful and way too dependent on drawing your "1" tiles.  I won *easily* and didn't feel at all like I deserved it.  Not good at all.

RATING: 6
I think I like Samurai more mainly for aesthetic reasons - these tiles are ugly!  It makes a little more sense when you see everything come together, but games like Carcassonne have much more pleasing visual appeal.  King's Gate is a total hybrid Knizia game with elements from many other games.  The game this probably bears more resemblance to Great Wall of China than Samurai, in that there is a dragon that cancels out a tile, a special power that makes all the values worth one, etc.  It's kind of fun, but not one that I would be itching to play continuously.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I have mixed feelings about this game. In a 4-player game you might be fighting for the victory through the whole game, but you might also fall out of the race quite early and quite easily through the actions of others. Then your playing could degenerate to the point where your only real choice on your turns is whether to aid one of your opponents or to try to remain as neutral as possible since victory is long gone from your grasp. Luck plays a big part, but it doesn't hide the tactical level of the game. Still, getting lots of 1s early in the game and having lots of chances to end rounds might be deciding factors. This is definitely a bigger game than its box suggests.

Another great game by Knizia...in the vein of his Kingdoms game, this one may take a bit longer and feel slower, but may reward with a bit more strategy?  I am unsure yet as I have played Kingdoms about 30 times and King's gate only 4 times...Has a real great feel though.OK Ive played a bunch now and can feel good about the 9 rating...very good game; always gets requests from my group.

King's Gate has a lot of good Samurai feel, but it includes some of the fiddly special cases that turn me off of a game like Three-Dragon Ante.  It also features an emphasized last-person-to-go advantage, especially with plentiful multi-play tiles.  The positional play is less strategic than in Samurai, since district placement is up to the player who happens to finish off the previous district.  It seems that play style would change somewhat dramatically for different numbers of players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Like a light Samurai (also Knizia's game), but boosted with Citadels' special characters. The result is humdrum tile-laying game which looks too dark. There are some other design errros too. I owned King's Gate for a while and won every single match I played it, but I still didn't like it. There is nothing new and because Samurai is so much better (and looks brilliant), King's Gate leaves only an empty feeling. If you haven't ever played any tile-laying game maybe then this is good…

One play.  4 players.  Essentially, this is the same game as Lord of the Rings: The Gathering - The Cardgame, which is one of my favorite games, so it's no surprise that I like this game.  You know, I've discovered, though, that I seem to wind up in the middle of these games - never winning, but never finishing dead last.  That probably means I'm playing too conservatively and too aggressively at the wrong times.

The box insert for this game absolutely makes no sense for this game.  The game itself is okay as a tile laying game trying to take influence over 10 different parts of the city.  Recommend playing with more than two players.  One of the ugliest games I've ever seen.

Pretty fair tile laying game.  I've mostly played this 2-player and there's a tendency for one player to be in control most of the game, though this doesn't necessarily translate to victory.  One big complaint - the graphics on the tiles could be greatly improved.

Quite atmospheric for a Knizia and plays pleasantly fast - the random draw of your tiles prevents too much analysis paralysis, which is always a good thing. And the finished city really looks splendid, although the tiles are a bit too dark. So far, it seems to be more of a tactical than a strategical game, but that might change with more games. Played 5+ times.

Usability wise the game is awful and I suspect would not get released as is today. The tiles are busy enough to make your eyes cross and not having any reminder on special locations or characters would just be considered a fail. Bigger issue is that game wise King's Gate is just mediocre, winner keeps winning and in a poor position there's little one can do.

As with the German LotR Card Game (the same exact game but using cards and a Lord of the Rings theme rather than tiles and a generic fantasy theme here) this works better with more players, in my opinion (3 better than 2 and 4 better than 3). I like games that deal with numbers this way (like Kingdoms) - I know a lot of folks don't so keep that in mind. I really like the way the game can end a few different ways and that the players have some control over this.

This is a suprisingly popular game among the people I play with.  I thought they&#039;d not like the abstract tile laying mechanism.  Not a bit of it.  Possibly my most played game in my collection (it&#039;s quick, which helps) and every game is reasonably close, and there&#039;s a variety of tactics to try, all dependent on how things pan out after a couple of turns.

RATING: 5
10 successive area majority contests with points for 1st, 2nd, and third, plus the gaining of one-use bonus powers. Each contest is won by placing tiles with the collective highest value in the 10 slots around each contest board, Samurai style. One of the keys is placing the last tile regardless of whether you win or not as you then place the next contest board, which you lay adjacent to tiles you've placed in previous contests, hence doubling their use. I found the game fairly dull with obvious plays. Save up your "go again" tiles until you can play them out to secure last play. Place some high tiles next to each other where you'll plan to play a contest board against them later. Play low if you can't secure points or the last play. Watch players get toasted by go-again plays and cancellation tiles. Do the same to others. Continue until it's all over. Ho hum.

Certainly not the best Knizia game, and not the best of his tile-laying games, either, but not a bad game at all. I am only marking this down from a 7 to a 6 because I am not overly happy with the components. The character disks and the special regions don't have anything to indicate their purpose, so one must keep referring to the rules booklet. The artwork is muddy, too. Still, the gameplay itself is quite interesting, although lacking the elegance and depth of, say, Samurai or Eurphrat & Tigris.

[b]Comments:[/b]
One of the absolute best games in FFG's Silver line.  Underrated.  A classic from Knizia.  The king is dying and the nobles (the players) try to get influence enough to be the next chosen. Influence is achieved by surrounding key areas (palace, library,) with buildings you control. The opponents can erect new buildings over the ones you already built so be careful. You have probably already guessed that there is a dragon that can be sent to destroy your opponents’ buildings.

This is a great area control game if played with 2 or 4 players.  I've played with 3 once, and the missing color and its accompnying numbers seemed to detract from the experience.
I really like the competition over the districts and your options for playing the different numbers can lead to some great decisions and short strategies.  Playing last on a district is hard to control, but can be very powerful.  I really enjoy this and would play anytime provided it's not as a 3 player.

I am surprised at the number of people who think that this game is a clone of Samurai. They both use the mechanic of surrounding a point of contention with tiles, but the similarities stop there.

That being said, King's Gate is extremely dull and flavorless. The theme doesn't work, the play doesn't evoke any feelings of "intrigue". It's just bland. The mechanics are fine but there's no fun or excitement to be had.

RATING: 7
This is a rather nice, accessible take on Samurai or Atlanteon, and more playable and enjoyable for me than either of the two.  There is a nice sense of simplicity as you only have to deal with one goal at a time.  I found the decisions rewarding and while you could get some tough draws, I liked the hand management aspect of the game.  I've only played this with two players, I think that three would probably work well, but I'm not sure if I'd be interested in playing this with four as the level of chaos would be too high for my taste.

The artwork works surprisingly well on the tiles and is striking and clear, but when laid out on the table it becomes a jumbled mess that ends up looking like some bad Magic Eye pictures that you saw in malls in the early 90's.  I kept expecting a sail boat, an SR-71 Blackbird or a tyrannosaurus rex to suddenly pop out of the tiles.

A simple tile placing game.  Usually I don't mean simple in a bad way but the simplicity adds to the monotony of the game.

One of the only games I can think of where better components could significantly improve the experience for me.  I'm not normally too picky in this regard.  However, I like Samurai as well as Great Wall of China, two similar games, but this one just leaves me flat despite being a solid strategic game, mainly because of the components, particularly the flimsy little circular tiles you win by finishing first in each area.  Maybe partially for that reason, the game feels too claustrophobic to me.

[several plays] It is a pretty simple and play fast and thus is a decent filler game.  There is some good thinking and strategy to decide when to go for a district and when to concede one and how to position yourself to finish one so you get to place the next one.  There is plenty of luck of the draw but really it comes down to the choices you make, so I like the game. However, I don't love the game.  There just are a few things the rub me the wrong way.  Like, how tie breaking is always to the player left of who completed it.  Seems like kind of weak tie-breaker.  It makes the game feel a bit chaotic because you don't know if you will be the next person to the left when a tie happens or not.  The colors of the tiles blend together and it makes it somewhat hard to always see at a glance what tiles are connected to the current location or not.  IMO the location tiles should be different color than the district tiles to avoid that confusion.  Also the number of "special" rules can make it a bit difficult for new players, certain locations and all the characters have special rules.  Really the game is what it is, a cheap, quick game with decent filler qualites, but definately not a top-tier strategy game.   -As I have played it more, the less I am into this game.  It is still alright, but there is probably better fillers out there.

A pretty good tile-laying game that is better the more players that you have.  Pretty decent strategy game overall.  But, some tile combos in the game are fairly obvious the more you play and can lead to some predictability.  I do like the mechanic of the character tokens.  This adds another aspect of the game beyond simple tile placement.  Good to introduce players to tile laying games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The mechanics are sound, there is some room for clever play (but less control with four players than with fewer), the game moves quickly and even the luck factor of which tiles you draw and have available doesn't seem to be too steep (and can be managed/mitigated with planning and patience). Sounds perfect, right? Eh. The artwork is muddy, the theme makes little sense, and the components are cheap. And, at it's heart, it's basically a simple surround/influence/capture tile game that has few design flaws but is nevertheless pretty lackluster.

Quick and fun, with a small fantasy flavor.  Looks really nice when laid out, and there is quite a bit of strategy, also.  See my review for more details.

OK game but gets bogged down by players who spend too much time thinking and then rethinking their play.  Really needs a 30 second timer!

Game is new and different enough from Samurai to merit an 8. Though subsequent plays might lower the score since city locations are non-random and always proceed from 1-10

The bad thing about this game is that I can't think of a good or bad comment for it.

Quick play, decent depth and not too difficult to learn.  Random tile draw gives good replay and hand management aspect.

RATING: 7
Concise area control game which works well with three. Luck of the draw may turn off some. This game falls to the tactics side of things over complex strategy.After half a dozen plays or more, the game holds up better than the components themselves. It is a solid filler game.

(One play) Not a bad game, and kind of interesting. Needs more plays to get familiar with the powers.

Build a kingdom and score as you go. A cross between Carcassonne and Smash Up but plays around 30 minutes.

One play with several newbies. Mechanics is nice, but theme is pasted up. Very dry feeling.

RATING: 6
Rating after one two-player session. I liked the game, but while the owner was explaining the rules I went from "Hey, great!" to "Oh, really?" to "Really?!". There are too many exceptions to the rules and too many "special powers" for such a small game.

At the end even the owner said "yeah, it plays better with more people".

This game has potential.  It doesn't take too long to play and has some interesting turns here and there.

This is an OK game, made better by the fact that both of my kids enjoy it. On it's own there may not be enough to keep players interested for more than a couple games.

Knizia; The king is dying and the nobles (the players) try to get influence enough to be the next chosen. Influence is achieved by surrounding key areas (palace, library,) with buildings you control. The opponents can erect new buildings over the ones you already built so be careful. Like in all good games there is a dragon :) It can be sent for destruction of your opponents’ buildings. Abstract Strategy; Tile Placement; retheme of Herr der Ringe, Der: die Gefährten das Kartenspiel

Maybe I would like it better now, but I doubt it. Just a standard Knizia.

A simple game with some interesting depth.  Only playable with the maximum of four players, IMO.

I can't share all the rage against this game.
Yes, yes, YES, art is awful to say the least and it hinders playability quite a lot... but you usually have to focus on just one small area of the game play, around the location, so the game is still perfectly playable.
The game is interesting and i would like to try it with random order of locations. Played in three you often have interesting decisions on how much to play to win a certain location, when to use the tiles with different powers and the characters.
Of course it reminds Samurai and Samurai is a better game, but i find KG a nice filler for lunch break

This tile laying game is fun and quick. I will always play another game as it only takes at most an hour. There is some good strategy and anyone can learn to play this one. The buildings with exceptions are sometimes hard to remember that you cant do certain things during play while trying to influence them, especially when you havent played for awhile.

RATING: 5
Rating is after one 2 player game. Lots of arbitrary complexity. The two player rules make this worse; I would definitely never play it again two player. I'd give it another try with more players, but I wouldn't have high expectations. And oh wow, the artwork is awful.

Similar to [gameid=3], but Samurai has a wonderful simplicity to its rules that is missing here.

Played a few times, then hasn't seen the table in *ages*.  Just doesn't grab me like some of the other games I own.

After 1 Play: This feels very similar to Samurai, another Knizia game, in that you are generally trying not to place the second to last piece.  I like Samurai better, so this probably won't get played again.  Also, the graphic design is headache-inducingly busy.

Typical Knizia tiles with numbers game.  Not as bad as Cthulhu Rising but not that inspired either.  I will play every so often if the mood strikes me.

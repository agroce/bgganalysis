I drop this in the category of one of the best thematic games that we own. When I first heard of this "dress making" game at BGG, I was initially very "meh" about it and turned off by the theme. But a buddy made the purchase and we played it over the holidays. A few days later, we bought it ourselves. :)

RATING: 8.5
A uniquely themed game about designing dresses/fancy coats that uses a central deck-management mechanic, has great art, scales very well from 2-5 players, and has smooth well-designed rules and gameplay.

Your goal is to score the most points by the end of 7 rounds, and each round you collect a small base income, refill the gameboard, and select 3 cards from your available deck (this mechanism is similar to card-drawing in Dominion).  Each turn you play an action through your cards, which have 2 key components to them (the level of expertise and the associated bonus action), and you have 5 different actions to choose from, but of course these are limited by your level of expertise on your card.

The actions are:
1) choose start player- this also gives you a nice money bonus
2) select another card- this card immediately goes into your hand and you have another action for this round only, and it will have the effect of building up your deck (you can win with a thin deck or a small deck, but generally, as per other deck games, the smaller the deck the better)
3) purchase silk/thread/lace tile- these are necessary resources for sewing a dress
4) sewing a dress- this requires the right combination of silk and/or lace and/or thread and it may also require a small amount of cash.  Once the dress/jacket is sewn, you have two options: a) sell the dress for cash, or b) place the dress for display in a hall which will score you end game points for the dress plus you are vying for majority points in each hall
5) purchase a decoration- this requires money and is worth endgame points and some of the decorations have special abilities such as end game multipliers, in-game cash bonuses etc.
6) fire an employee- this allows for a quick infusion of cash and also thins your deck

There are minimal points scored in-game with the majority coming at the end of the game through: decorations, scoring abilities of cards, dresses/jackets, majorities of dresses/jackets in the halls.

The rules a very well-written, the artwork is nice, the scalability is very good, and the gameplay meshes and works very smoothly.  Definitely a well-polished and professional design that is sadly a bit overlooked and underplayed likely due to a controversial and poor marketing campaign.

RATING: 8
2 plays / 4,5 players

LIKE: Hard, meaningful decisions. No decisions are really bad. The card-hand management and area control is fun. Interesting blend of mechanisms.
DISLIKE: the card combos and late game lend favor to experience. Turn order is paramount, and analysis paralysis is rampant.

OVERALL: I really liked it, but the amount of options is overwhelming for a first play. I could see a few more plays being a bit easier. I really liked the area control aspect, oddly enough. Best of all, dress-making was interesting!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A pretty theme and assuredly unique. Execution is fine and there is some interesting maneuvering with your character cards. But for all that, it feels forgettable as a game experience. Somehow too simplistic or too few truly interesting choices. And it lopes along in game speed with swingy scoring at the end. So ok, but not great.

Rokoko mixes a bunch of proven mechanics into a semi complex set of rules. Complex in the sense that some interactions are quite hard to explain and easy to misinterpret. Luckily there is only a few, though. On the first play, I also found it rather hard to form a longer term strategy and to judge my moves on my gut feeling alone. And this is not common for me. Rokoko is a game that requires you to be alert throughout the whole game since it is very easy to spend your actions on things that appear to be good but in reality gain you nothing.
 
Once everyone is familiar with the game, players find themselves in a very competitive environment racing for the best scoring opportunities. There are a few avenues you can advance which creates nice trade-offs for you to ponder giving you a feeling your decisions are meaningful. On the other hand, especially towards the end of a round you can also find yourself in a situation in which no action is beneficial to you. Of course, it is usually your own fault driving yourself into such a situation, but it would appeal to a wider audience if all your actions gave you feel of going forward even if it was in very small steps only, i.e. choosing between optimal and sub-optimal instead of good and detrimental.
 
It might sound that that I do not like Rokoko but this is not the case. All I am saying is that Rokoko is ruthless, a true gamer’s game. In addition, the game is a little long (up to 180min with 5 players). So choose carefully who you play with, but in the right company I believe the game can shine.

RATING: 10
A first class euro. There is something truly satisfying about playing a intense, brain burner game with a well made theme about running a dress making company trying to help some aristocratic asshole from the Rokoko period put on the best ball he possibly can. Don't let the theme fool you, this shit gets serious. While the game has a lot of interwoven mechanics, they are complimentary and intuitive. You draft new employees of different skill levels into your deck to execute actions in order to rent dresses to patrons in an effort to gain area control of halls for end game scoring or to sell for quick cash in order to decorate the ball to gain specific powers or more end game scoring. You get special powers on your recruited cards as well which you can use to give yourself an edge during play. The whole thing is wonderfully produced in terms of components and iconography that enables an easy learn. The player aids are particularly noteworthy as they lay out order of play and all the actions you can take in a really straight forward manner. Rokoko also involves gaining a queens favor and watching fireworks at the end of the game for extra scoring so I recommend playing Hanabi and Love letter before or after :). Also, play AC/DC's "I like big balls" song during the set up and or scoring phase. It's just the right thing to do.

Excellent game!  Due to the limited actions, it feels tight the whole way through.  Money, resources (cloth and thread/lace), actions, spots on the board -- you always want to do more than you can.

I particularly like how it's worker placement without placing any workers.  The cards you play strictly determine your options and limit your choices.  By the same token, it's up to you to chose which 3 cards to play each round and, from that, which type of employees to hire.  Masters are great, but the others have better bonuses.  Such a sweet spot for tension!

Matthias Cramer is a clever designer.  He mixes elements that I generally don't enjoy - in this case resource conversion, a veritable point salad, a touch of deckbuilding and a loose fitting theme (we are dressmakers, but also party planners?) - and makes them palatable.  That theme does work nicely so far as the area majorities that are at the core of the game are concerned.  I certainly would want more aristocrats wearing my creations to the ball than my competitors' rags.  

There are lots of nice touches. Like how Rokoko inverts the usual convention that the later you select an action the more it will cost. Desperate to grab a resource tile or a certain employee early in the round?  You will pay a premium and your opponents' later purchases will be cheaper. The deckbuilding element keeps it simple, yet  how you manipulate, add to and subtract from that deck and how much effort you put into doing that rather than things that score points, is key. Finally, something I always like, Rokoko is highly interactive in its competition for majorities, and to grab resources and make a certain dress before someone else with the same idea. A lot of its fun lies in the tension of prioritizing what must be done before the opportunity is snatched away.  All the same, there are times when I am reminded that this is a point salady, resource converting deckbuilder and my rating reflects a certain ambivalence. 

Production quality is mostly good, although some of the coins and prestige tokens in my Pegasus edition were poorly die cut. The artwork is not really to my taste and the preponderance of dark colours on the board can mean that important features are missed.  The rules are an easy read.

A nice eurogame where players collect fabrics and create dresses for the big party at the king's palace. Instead of a regular worker placement game, here each player has a deck of characters cards (each with a unique ability) and is also able to add new characters to it. Sort like a deck-building game. The artwork is nice but the truth is that a find the whole theme and gameplay a bit dry and dull.

A surprising theme for an otherwise almost classical euro with a hint of deck building. It's not hard to learn the game and build a sound strategy from the very beginning.

Rococo seems to have a lot of euro goodness in it.  It felt to me somewhere between a 7 and an 8, but gonna give it an 8 for its fun factor and quirky theme.  

I am fond of the simple card drafting mechanic in the game, and the placement of finished products in the rooms with an eye toward eventually earning area majority bonuses.  That felt fun.  I like the random chits with fabrics and dynamic costing mechanics, as well as the finished product line.  I like the way that things are "taken" by other players through worker acquisitions, thus forcing Plan B actions.  This is basic worker placement fun. 

The game reminds me very much of Fresco which is also a very nice euro, and as I think of the comparisons, the one thing that I miss in Rococo is choosing the waking time to determine an ever-changing turn order.  In Rococo (as in, for example, Agricola or Caverna), one person can seize the first player bonus with one of their actions, and thus, the next round simply proceeds clockwise from that player.  That does tend to create some sense of "I should sit clockwise next to the player who always wants to go first."  After the first game, I felt that in my second game, now definitely wanting to win, I needed to strategize more on who to sit next to, which causes some mixed feelings I suppose.  Then again, I would do the same if I were to start a game of Agricola or Caverna.

Never thought we would be able to get into a game about making clothes for the French nobility. This is another one that Richard Ham suckered us into getting (thanks Rahdo)but we have enjoyed it.

Complex and challenging it can fill a couple hours with a fun game that will surprise you.

It's as elegant as you might think, and even though the theme is not the first in line of my personal interests, it really shines through in how you race around preparing the Ball, by funding decorations and making and selling dresses for both male and female attendees. A simple and fluid design, most of the complexity (if any) here comes through the scoring, which is the most involved part of the game. Great.

RATING: 8.2
Lovely game, with a good flow and interesting mechanics. The deck-building aspect feels very nice; the random chance is removed from it, but you still have to balance maintaining a tight and lightweight deck (which you can cycle through swiftly) against the ever increasing smorgasbord of better options. 
Almost every move you make is a good one, but picking up the _better_ ones is crucial. The one semi-negative thing about the game is that you must be really aware of the end-game scoring, as well as the final batch of employee-cards, so that you can keep all of that in mind when making decisions. Experienced players will have a very definite edge over newbies there. Better with fewer players; too many means too much chance of crucial tiles or cards being taken. 
Unfortunately it's extremely easy for this game to slow down to a crawl.

Pros:
Mechanics are interesting, worker abilities are cool. Decisions are meaningful. Theme is a bit meh but it fits the game well I think.
Lots of ways to earn points.

Cons:
Takes way too long. (3h+)
Moderately long downtime between rounds. You cannot plan ahead too much.
Board gets too cluttered after a while with all kinds of colors and can be distracting.
I think it would need too many games to get familiar with and shorten the playtime (but I don't think it would go below 2h).

First Play: Slightly off putting theme about dress making in the French court in the 18th Century. Once you get over that this is a very well balanced pure euro that demands a sound engine to be built to do well. Lots going on and a need to keep an eye out for what others are doing. Double sided board scales play nicely for 2-5 players. If my collection wasn't so overburdened I'd buy this.

I don't think anyone will accuse this game of being revolutionary, but I just like it. It pretty much has no chance of becoming a 9 or 10, but it is firmly entrenched as an 8. It works. The theme is different, the strategies varied, the interaction plenty, the deck-building is just enough, and the luck pretty low. I've played with 2 and 3, but I would like to try with more, to use the other side of the board.

Nagyszerű játék. Egy problémám van csak, hogy túl erős a szökőkút, bár a későbbi lapokkal lehet kompenzálni. Az első két körben mindenki a szökőkútra megy és nem igazán látok más lehetőséget. Ez az elejét egy kicsit egyoldalúvá teszi. Mindezek mellett hangulatos gyönyörű játék, melyet egy jó társasággal bármikor játszanék. A téma meg kifejezetten egyedi.

I thought my wife and I would really enjoy this game, but it fell flat for us. The gameplay has cool elements and we liked the card play, but at the end of the day it just felt like a "euro on a pile of euros". A lot of typical mechanics thrown in and the area majority elements made the end game scoring feel tedious. I can see the appeal of the game, but in our eyes it was just an average euro at best and doesn't need to be in our collection.

A modern-style 'euro-with-a-theme' where you win by VP's and there are lots of ways to getting them. In this game it's not an ordeal, however. It's a balance act timing your action cards. Various areas on the board increase in cost the later you acquire them, and some milestones yield more VP's the quicker you get them, so there's always a sense of urgency.

There are multiple layers of area control going on and actions are available by cards in your action deck. These cards get recycled, and you can acquire better cards or 'sell' cards that are dead weight. Areas and cards are bought with money and money is gained by creating dresses/coats. These garments require various fabrics and each step in the fabric->dress->money->board location is available by playing the applicable action cards.

It's a nice mix of deckbuilding, area control and set collection. Not too heavy, but deep enough for repeated plays.

Very nice area control deck builder. Zero real interaction. It's all about taking something before someone else takes it: a location, a card, a good or a dress. For new players it can be hard to accurately value many of the spaces on the board in the context of a turn, so this needs a couple plays and end-game scorings to get your bearings. Should play quickly even at 4 with experienced players.

Many ways of scoring make it almost impossible to predict more profitable moves in late turns of the game (it seems chaotic). You can't really see who's winning until you finish playing and count everything. Usually you have to wait for your turn just a little too long.

This is a kind of small deck building game with tailors in three levels, who are supporting the royal society!

The bonus abilities of the cards and the myriad of ways you can score points in the game is great, makes it so that you never feel like you have nothing to do to improve your score.  Need to play this all the way to the end next time but I don't my opinion will change.

First Essen game that I'm thinking of pre-ordering.  It reads a little like PaP, with the collecting of silk and yarn and stuff to make dresses.  However, the construction and sale of it is 2-tiered with options of selling for money and VPs.  Also, it looks like there is some deck-building hand management to it which could be interesting.  I'm not convinced how strong it will be and may wait to see the cost, but it's definitely got me curious.

Juego de reglas no muy complicadas, pero con bastante que pensar. Tiene un poco de deck builder y gestión de la mano, mayorías, lotes, etc.

Cada jugador tiene unos personajes con los que puede ir haciendo trajes q pueden lucir personalidades luego en el palacio real, otorgando prestigio. También se pueden vender y obtener dinero. Hay tres tipos de personajes, los maestros, los oficiales y los aprendices. Cada uno tiene sus cosas. Además de la acción que te permiten hacer, pueden otorgar un bonus. Hay muchos.

Se pueden contratar personajes nuevos y demás. La verdad, es que las reglas no son muy complicadas, pero tienes que estar muy pendiente de cómo van los demás.

A los jugones les gustará sin duda. Tiene el problema de la temática, que a muchos les hecha para atrás, pero lo cierto es que es un juegazo. Sospecho que a no jugones también les puede gustar, aunque les puede estallar la cabeza.

Still on my "maybe someday" list. I do think the card use is interesting and I love the theme. Plus the part that frustrated me in Concordia was the player-driven ending, whereas as this game has a defined number of rounds! At least I'm fairly sure??

This is one of the most unique games I have played in a long time, with neat new thematic elements that include fashion apparel/decorations amongst the competing wealthy aristocrats in the Rococo period (of which I knew nothing of until I played this game). It is a medium heavy game due to the end game scoring, and instead of the typical four actions to select from, there are six. There are a clear layout of actions on the player boards and cards, and I have found this game to have the least amount of rules questions/issues of any other game I have played, especially at this weight of game play. I love the action selection of the cards, which players have a decent amount of control in selecting each turn. They can also 'Depute' characters to trim their deck, adding a subtle element of deck building to the game. The characters are limited, but can accomplish several things. Beautifully designed game, including the map and bits. Finally, you get a 2 for 1 deal with the two sided board, which is well designed for every number of players. Brilliant. UPDATE: If I have not made my opinion clear, this is the most well-designed game I have played in my 10 years of collecting, playing, and rating games on BGG.
Includes the 4 value 5 Fancy Dresses Promos.

Another fresh one from Cramer. The theme of sewing dresses was not enticing, but the game play is quite good. And for a euro, the game ends up being very thematic. 

A light hint of deck building that doesn't ruin the game (I dislike deck building games).

Update after second + fourth play 7.5 -> 8.0 -> 8.5

Nothing overly new, but somehow it comes together well, and after 4 plays, it is holding up. One of the best titles of 2013.

Great game. Beautiful board and bits, clean, tight mechanics, and a lovely, original theme (I love eighteenth-century themes generally, so no complaints about the dresses here!). I've heard this game compared to Fresco, which I also like a lot, and they are similar, but the deck-building aspect of this brings it up a notch for me. The extra actions you get by recruiting workers are very helpful, but you [i]must[/i] thin your deck to make it more efficient or you will fall behind (though I've never tried getting the score cards that reward larger decks, so maybe that's a viable strategy too). 

I love the stiff competition over the materials and the dresses, which makes timing of actions crucial: do you let someone else hire that awesome worker first, or do you give them an opportunity to take that cloth you need so badly? Very interactive, very engaging. From a purely design perspective, an excellent game.

3/24/15: An interesting take on hand management where each card represents a worker, and you get to pick only 3 of the cards in your deck to play per round. Each card played then goes to your discard which you will collect and use again  when you have no more cards to make a hand of three cards for the next round(and there are only seven rounds in the game so good cards may not be available again for a while).  Scoring is dependent on an area majorities struggle on the board represented by ball rooms at a palace of the French monarch.  Dressmaking is how these areas are populated(purchasing of different fabric colors and combinations of lace and thread),  you make a dress or coat for a noble and they take a spot in a ball room(or you can sell your creation for cash).

Overall very good game play and the component quality is excellent.

RATING: 6
Rococo has a pretty interesting mechanism, with the neat idea of adding a minor amount of deck building to a legitimate board game.  You will use a hand of employee cards to get tasks done for you.  They also all provide you with some sort of extra ability.  Throughout the game, you will be able to evolve your deck of cards through addition of new employees and the release of other employees, which is a neat mechanic.

However, I didn't find the actual rest of the game all that interesting.  In general, you are gathering cloth to make dresses, which you will either sell for cash, or rent to people attending the ball..  The cash can for selling be used to hire more employees, buy cloth, and decorate the ballroom (which gives you points for various things), while the rented out dresses will score you VPs and allow you to participate in some area majority in the various ball rooms.

Overall, the game started to feel a bit samey to me, with mostly gathering cloth to make dresses, but it is still a solid design that I would like to play again, mostly to see if I can better create a workforce that does things more efficiently.

RATING: 7
In this game you'll create dresses and ornaments to impress the crowd and make a name for yourself. By recruiting different tailors, gathering resources and money you'll try to be efficient as possible to score the most points. There are a few different ways to score points (by either focussing on dresses, scoring employees and majorities). Not a lot, by enough different ways to have some variety in choosing your path to victory

In terms of new games, [b][thing=144344][/thing][/b] was the game of the week.  We broke it out 3p on Friday, and I was very pleasantly surprised.  Given [person=34699][/person]'s games to date, I expected a pretty dry, solitary Eurogame with a little novelty.  But the level of interaction and engagement with other players was actually quite high.  We were watching and measuring each other pretty carefully the entire time.  I thought the deck building elements were used rather well (I preferred that aspect to [thing=124361][/thing]'s implementation), and the game offers a good mix of light strategy and difficult tactical choices.  Our first session was a little slow, but my wife enjoyed it enough we played it a second time that same day.  Though the game was not as good with just 2p (I think 3p will be the sweet spot for this one), the game held up to the second play well.  My concerns about too many scripted elements is a minor one for me; in terms of strategy, I tried something quite different in both games and won both.  As you would expect from [person=11825][/person], the graphic design is far too busy and makes surveying the board to assess majorities rather tricky.  I don't understand the gamers who find this style appealing.  [thing=144344][/thing] is certainly in the upper echelon of this year's more traditional Euros, along with [thing=144592][/thing] and possibly [thing=143693][/thing].

Try to abuse combos in a tactical point grab that requires knowledge of the cards and system to play well. And it runs kind of long. Not really my type of game, but not bad. 

Gather resources to buy dresses, and use the dresses for either cash, or to contest area majorities. You use three cards each round to perform all of these actions, so there is a hand management element as well. I personally found there to be very little player interaction. Fighting for the majorities is a minor part of the game, even with 4.

RATING: 7.5
Rococo is a game that has flown somewhat under the radar I think, and if more people had played it it would probably be rated a little higher. It is a game which features a bunch of different game mechanics such as deck building, area majority/influence, hand management and drafting. This definitely makes the game quite unique. I really like how you can take 6 different actions, but some of them cannot be taken by your apprentices (certain cards), while the master dressmaker can take any actions. This makes him attractive, and you need to buy a couple of that type as they are able to make the best dresses. But you still need some of the apprentice and journeyman cards as every card gives a bonus beside the main action. This makes the game very interesting as you need to decide which cards to buy and which to trash. I don’t think you need a tiny deck in order to do well, actually I think a big deck can net you a lot of points if you get the apprentice which gives you 11 points for having a lot of cards. But there are definitely several paths to victory.

During the game you collect cloth/silk and lace and yarn in order to create fancy dresses which can either give you money (so you can buy new stuff or even use your money on the fountain in order to get extra points or income etc.) or points – if you choose the latter, you place the dress in a room of your choice which gives you endgame victory points based on area majority. 
 
Yet a positive thing about Rococo is that it comes with a two-sided board for different player counts. This is always a nice feature. It works very well across the player numbers and plays smoothly. Definitely one of those “hidden gem” games!

This game needs lots of love, as in "lots of people need to love it"!  An excellent card drafting/hand management/resource management game that provides a reasonable challenge.  95% of the scoring comes at end game, so it can be difficult to determine the final winner until the end.

I would consider this a game worth playing on a regular basis, and I hope it stays in my rotation of games for quite some time.

The game was enjoyable and I was surprised at how quickly the rounds went after the first even with 5 people. The deck building adds a nice spin since you can thin your deck and choose your cards each round as opposed to drawing blind. Many of the people you can hire have bonus abilities and it would have been nice if there was text on them as opposed to icons. The iconography did pick up easily, but a few words are always easier and appreciated.

What really brings this game down to me is the end game scoring. It's nothing but a chore to get through and the amount of color on the board at the end between property markers and dresses makes for a color overload as sometimes you are looking at dress color and sometimes marker color and they are all the same! If the game had a score track this would make the game much better since the majority of the scoring can be done during the game. I guess the good news from no score track is that we had no clue who was winning, but it took us just as long to score the game as it did to play 1 round.

Game mechanics are flawless.  Nice majority game with a very interesting hand management (mini deck building (don't be discouraged by the term deck building, it's really more like an action selection)).  One of my favourite medium+ euro.
It's no more thematic than Orleans, or Castles of Burgundy, but it is refreshing to play something that's not vikings/colonists/medieval traders for a change.

Nice game. Played a couple times back to back last night. Sort of reminds me of Concordia and Glass Road, in that you have a deck of cards, which can expand, and you choose three cards to use for the current round. Once those cards are used (one per turn), they go in your personal discard pile, and will be cycled once you run out of cards to draw. But you always choose the cards to draw, so no shuffling. 

I like the concept that you do a main board action (from a menu of 6 simple actions), and a bonus action based on your card, but your card only affects your main board action in that your card specifies a "level" for your worker of that action, and certain actions have minimum worker level requirements. 

Lots of different ways to score, and in fact the endgame scoring is a bit much for some first-time players (also kinda like Concordia)

Board is a little too colorful/busy for me, but it works ok. But it's not as bad as like Euphoria. 

I certainly do not play with hidden VP or cloth, as the rules indicate. That's just silly. There's already plenty of uncertainty in that you don't know what cards other players have chosen for the round, and there are random elements in terms of dresses and materials that come available each round. No need to add memory just to try to avoid AP.

A sort-of majorities game with point salad-croutons and an action card system which allows for small deck enlargement or downsizing, giving it a feel of being a shadow of a full deck builder. I find the subject matter of tailors making costumes for an infamous Louis XV ball humorous: it's silly beyond belief, of course, but somehow I can't help but wonder what thought process led to the conclusion that [i]yes, this![/i] was going to be what it was about.

The game itself plays out unremarkably. Choose your actions wisely or risk the consequences. Battle your opponents for priority access to choice locations securing lots of VP for the end. At times hire new characters, at other times fire weak and unfit characters which just clog up your action hand. Win lots of VP by converting actions into cloth and sewing utensils into clothes into money or VPs. This aspect is depressingly standard and will surely not cause anyone pulse to beat any quicker. The fun bit is the action card manipulation which tends to promote memorising what might end up approximately when. And once you have that down pat, I fear the game loses its appeal. There is very little else going on besides the rather straightforward conversion engine. Perhaps a little bickering about the power of being first player. But really, are you going to play this game for long enough to expect to notice this becoming an issue...?

My rating floats somewhere between 4 and 5. I'll be lenient and give the game the higher rate for its whole... but as far as the [i]game[/i] goes, this is 4-material.

Only the people on the top row get to watch the fireworks. How very Titanic-esque. 

This game drips with a posh theme that was not pasted on. The scheming is reinforced by the artwork. The mood is thick. The attitudes of the rich and snobby, and class warfare on the grandest of small scales is on display. It is the black spider sitting at the junction of three threads: funny, sad, and fascinating.

They don't often make games this good.

It seems to one up "A Castle for All Seasons" by a large margin by offering some of the same flag planting goodness but so much more.

I would like to play this again and see if my rating changes. When I did play it, the rules explanation wasn't very clear and I found myself spending most of the game trying to grasp what was going on. The markets for goods and being able to sell workers for money was pretty interesting. With 5 players, there seemed to be a lot of downtime between turns. It only got longer since this was our last game of the day.

Played again last night and this game is fun. The use of a shifting deck for available workers very much feels like a simpler version of Mombasa and makes current decisions impact future decisions; using the very powerful masters leaves the next turn with nothing but apprentices. The markets for cloth and employees has costs reduced by players buying other goods and not just by their position. That makes timing your purchase critical. If you wait too long, the items you need might be gone but pick them up too early and you pay a lot more money. It's a very well done mid/heavy euro game that seems to appeal to enough gamers that you should have no trouble finding people to play with.

The second play was with 5 and things can get very slow with five players and even more so if one of those players takes a long time between turns. I would love to play this at a lower player count (maybe 3) and see if the game speed improves. The problem is when we pull this out at the local meetup groups, everyone wants to join and we end up with 5.

Quintessential euro with many ways to score --- probably above the average number of ways to score for such a game.

RATING: 6
The Good: I love the area control/area majority mechanisms. Lots of choices, at least in the early game.  Nice artwork on the components, the board is very nice, but dark.

The Bad:  The theme sucks.  Dress making? Really?  The game's main flaw is what I call "Diminishing returns"  At the end of the game, most places on the board are taken, so you're forced to make a bad, or even worthless play, just because there's nothing else left.  Scoring is a little complex, and not intuitive.  Some scoring methods aren't very clear on the board.  This is supposed to work well with just 2-player. but I'm not so sure.  Scoring chits instead of a score track on the board can keep who's ahead hidden, but makes scoring a pain in the butt.

The Verdict: OK game, but not spectacularly so.  The theme is really boring.  I don't thing that this is one I'm particularly eager to play again, and I definitely won't be purchasing or trading for it, but I wouldn't turn it down on Game Night.

Beautiful and quite thematic game. You don't see many games about making dresses so quite fun just due to that. More of a feel-good game than a gamers game even though you can block each other and so on. Maybe due to the theme?

The game is easy to play and didn't overstay it welcome. Will gladly play again.

One of my faves from Essen 2013. A delightful combination of deck building and action selection with scoring based on a combination of completed dresses (yes, really) and area majorities from the ballrooms in which the dresses are placed. The theme is familiar: collect resources, convert them into stuff (dresses) and score points. The clever bit is the cards: there are three types of cards, one allows you to take any action and the worst limits you to only a few of the actions. And you can only take 3 cards in with you to a round. However, you can buy more cards in the round. And therein lies the tension. Buy new action cards with your valuable actions, or collect resources to make dresses, or try and earn income to buy valuable board spaces? 

It may sound familiar but it actually plays quite differently from anything else I have played. In a way I would draw a parallel with what Uwe Rosenberg did with Glass Road: applying card play and limited card selection to a familiar action-selection based game. I liked it very much although the player who went for the card-buying big-time scored an easy victory. And so I would conclude that building your deck is a good idea as the card goes straight into the hand and allows an immediate expansion in the actions you can take. A real surprise hit for me.

Very unique theme. Best played with 4 bearded men. Players are royal tailors in the French court during Rokoko era. It's one stylish point salad, where tailors are competing for the prestige on the court by sewing and presenting dresses or making decorations for the great ball, using deck building and area control mechanics (where areas are various rooms at the royal palace). Main interaction between players in racing each other over control of these areas or for picking best employees to add to deck or for sewing the most prestigious dresses. 

[b]Favorite mechanism:[/b] Deck building with three different type of cards (employees) where the lowest (iron) apprentices can do less stuff but give great bonuses and higher (golden) tailors can do all actions but give small or no bonuses.

A szerző játékait csak olvastam-fordítottam eddig, a Lancaster már ott vár egy ideje, h végre kipróbáljam, most mégis inkább a ruhakészítés rejtelmeibe kapcsolódtam be.
És nem bántam meg.
Komponensek:
A játéktábla, az elemek szépek, jó színekkel, és minden jelölve a táblán. Nyelvfüggetlen. A kártyák jelei egyértelműek, jól "olvashatóak", azaz értelmezhetőek.
A játék
7 forduló, 4 fázis, 6 akció + bónusz akciók.
A 4 fázis: előkészítés, alkalmazottak kiválasztása (mivel akciózol a fordulóban), akció végrehajtás, bevétel.
Az alapötlet jó: mint egy ruhakészítő céhben vannak alkalmazottak, mester, segéd és tanonc. Mindenkinek van egy alappaklija, amiben van 2 mester, 1 segéd és 2 tanonc. Természetesen ezekhez majd lehet újakat "felvenni", illetve van h távozik közülük vki.
Minden forduló 2. fázisában a saját alkalmazott talonodból kiválasztasz 3 lapot, azok az alkalmazottakkal akciózhatsz majd. Akit felhasználtál a dobó paklidba kerül. A következő fordulóban a talonban maradtakat kell felvenned, vagyis onnan 3-at, ha kevesebb van ott, akkor a dobópaklidból lesz új talon, és abból KIEGÉSZÍTED 3-ra a már kezedben lévőket. AH teljesen üres volt a talonod, akkor persze a komplett dobópakliból lett talonból kell a 3-at kiválasztanod. Így persze muszáj minden kártyád felhasználnod, és előre is kell tervezni 1 körrel minimum (a beszerzett új alkalmazottak függvényében még előbbre.)
Aztán jön az akciófázis
Mindenki sorban egymás után 1 alkalmazottjával végrehajt a lehetséges akciókból 1-et, majd ha van akkor az alkalmazott bónusz akció.
Ebben a sorrendben kell, de nem muszáj egyiket sem végrehajtani. Ez fontos, azaz a bónusszal szerzett esetleges cuccok nem használhatóak az alkalmazott akciójához.
A 6 akció :- nem minden akciót tud minden alkalmazott végrehajtani. Új embert csak mester bérelhet, a segéd ezenkívül mindent csinálhat, a tanonc csak félét.
Nyersanyagvásárlás: selyem vagy fonál, vagy csipke. egy árulapkán ezek vmilyen kombinációja van -színe a selyemnek fontos- és a megvásárláskor el kell dönteni, h a selymet használom belőle vagy a csipke-fonalat. Ára változó: ha tele a raktár adott szintje, akkor 2 pénz, ha az utolsó, akkor ingyenes.
Új ember felvétele: csak mesterrel: 4-ből lehet válszatani a forduló elején, de akkor még drága, a forduló során nem lesz töltve, a végén ingyen jutsz hozzá az utolsóhoz. Ha marad a következő fordulóra dobásra kerül.
Királynő kegye - tanonc kivételével bárki. 5 pénz, és a köv forduló kezdőjátékosa, az utolsó fortdulóban még pontot is ad.
Ruhakészítés:
A kitett ruhákból lehet választani, van egy alapára 0-8, és nyersanyag költsége: selyem+fonál+csipke vmilyen kombó, itt fontos a selyem színe. Az elkészített ruhát vagy rögtön eladjuk - pénz bevétel, vagy kikölcsönözzük: pont a játék végén. Kölcsönzéskor a bál épületének 5 termének egyikébe kell letenni, ahol egyrészt bónuszok is lehetnek, másrészt olyan helyek, ahova csak mesterrel készített ruha kerülhet le. A ruhák közt is van olyan amit csak mester készíthet el.
Ha mind az 5 teremben van ruhája a játékosnak: bónusz pont -csökkenős az elérés függvényében-
Alkalmazott elküldés: pénz jár érte típusától függő, plusz utoljára a bónusza végrehajtható.
Dekoráció finanszírozása: tűzijáték mezők, szobor (mindkettő játék végi pont kombó), szökőkút (menetközben plusz bevétel), zenészek (játék végi pont, és holtversenyoldó)
Bónuszakciók:
Az alap alkalmazottaknál a mestereknek nincs. Aztán újonnan elvett alkalmazottak mindegyikénél van. A bónusz lehet újabb akció a fenti 6 vmelyikéből, lehet nyersanyaghoz jutás, lehet pont- és/vagy pénzszerzés, spec bónusz: a játék végi sok pontokat hozó. Jól van kitalálva.
A játék végi pontozás (és ebben van megint jó ötlet, pl. tűzijáték, szoborkombó):
1. 10 pénz 1 pont - maradék holtversenydöntő
2. bizonyos alkalmazottak játék végi pontokat adnak (erős kombók!)
3. termenként többségi értékelés, holtversenynél mesterrel készített ruha, ha az is döntetlen, akkor zenész
4. tűzijáték többség értékelés
5. A legfelső teremből (király terme) átcsoportosít embereket a tűzijátékhoz: akinek van fent tűzijátéka, az tehet oda ruhát, ha van neki a király termében: pontszorzó. (A tűzijáték alapban is többség értékelve, jó pont, ez a szorzó megint igen jó pont, viszont ennek megfelelően a tűzijáték sem olcsó)
6. szobor értékelés (ruha kombókért pont) (Nem rossz pont, de elég komoly pénz odakerülni)
7. ruhák és dekorációk értékelése (minden ruhán van egy pontérték, a dekorációkon is, összeadjuk, plusz a tűzijátéknál szorzódik)

Szóval nagyon bejött. Sokfelé figyelős, de igazából mindenre nem lehet, plusz interaktív is: mert persze nyilván más is pont azt a nyersanyagot-ruhát-helyet akarja, és ugye nem mindegy, h melyik alkalmazottal mit lehet. Ugyanakkor ha elvesznek előled, akkor újratervezhető, vannak alternatívák - pont a sok lehetőség miatt.

Nekem nagyon-nagyon

It works but was not really fun. I cannot say it's a bad game (and I think this is a good game), but I didn't really enjoy playing it. Perhaps it's because the theme is not really appealing. I have the feeling of a medley of good ideas that don't really fit together. In fact, as you score everywhere, it's almost impossible to know if you're in good position or not. Kinda disapppointed.

In my quest to find a "girly game" I stumbled upon Rococo, it is a terrific game and the theme of dressmaking really shines through. Rococo requires players to really think about what they want to accomplish on a turn and ponder the many routes to prestige points. I like that when you hire a worker it immediately becomes part of your hand for the current turn, which means that all players may not have an equal number of actions. My only complaints are the box is a tad flimsy and all the workers are men (even if this is historically accurate, it's annoying).

I really enjoy this game, but I have a problem playing games with dark boards.  I never have the desire to play them.  I wish I felt differently because this game is a fantastic combination of deckbuilding, area control, and action selection.  There's a lot going on, but it plays oh so smoothly. The theme is also refreshing and well executed.

Rococo is another game that offers multiple methods of scoring points. Smart investment in every area is the key to being successful. That said, it can be challenging to identify which investments do what, as they are not always clear (why statuary and fountains)?

One thing to remember - the primary method of scoring is area control in the different rooms of the manor. Keep that in mind and you'll do fine.

First of all, this game is not "deck building" but "hand building" in that you add cards to your available hand, and you *never* shuffle your deck in this game. You always choose what 3-card hand to play from your available cards; the only time a card is unavailable is when it's in your discard pile from you having played it. Perhaps due to this reason the game feels very thinky and players can get clogged up with AP. You need to make sure you choose your 3-card hand carefully and play them in the right order. 

The point of the game is chaining actions efficiently to claim new cards for deck synergies and spots on the board for income and area majority VP scoring. You play your cards for a main action and then a secondary bonus action. In a nice twist, lower level cards (e.g., Apprentice) cannot activate certain actions (e.g., Make a Dress). So when adding new cards to your hand, you must consider the "rank" of card and not just the action that comes with it.

Scoring is pretty opaque at first because you get only a few in-game points and most at game end when you’ve acquired endgame VP cards and final board scoring is performed. Cash is tight and opportunities are scarce making turn order important and building an income engine first priority over VPs. 

Overall I quite like this game. It’s thinky and long (2-3 hours) but I find drafting my deck of actions as the deck progresses to be quite fun. While the game can lend itself to bouts of AP, I’m usually so engaged with what I’m going to do next that I don’t notice too much. I do think the base game has limited replayability (after 2-3 games and you’ve seen all the cards the puzzle doesn’t seem as exciting) and the Jewelry Box expansion is highly recommended for extra cards as well as extra dimensions.

May 2014.

Great name for what is an interesting medley of mechanics: area control, hand management, card drafting and combining various resources to manufacture VPs / cash. The theme is unusual and nicely applied (although I'm not 100% sure why luxury dressmakers are funding fireworks and fountains).

Plenty of dilemmas each turn; the shared offering results in blocked plans and therefore requires opportunism and deft re-evaluation.

So far, I'm impressed. Best 2013 game I've played to date.

I like the deck building mechanism here. Should you build up your deck with many cards or use some of your turns to discard cards in order to get your deck slimmer (with only the best cards) and receive money for them? Money is really tight in this game. Played with 5 players, and the game dragged a little out in time. I would gladly play it again.

The interesting idea here is it's a deck builder where you have full control over the order you draw your cards.  My biggest issue was that things never refilled or adjusted price during a round, so turn order became really important.  Also, area majority is one of my least favorite scoring mechanisms.

RATING: 7
2 plays so far. Seems that the right strategy is to cleverly use bonus actions after buying extra workers. You also need 1 card to dismiss workers via a bonus action.

The game is OK with 2 players but I imagine it's better with 3 or 4. Five ppl seem too many.

I keep looking at this one, and I keep putting it down because the theme it not going to impress anyone in my gaming group, but it looks really good, and I want to play,

The deck building game where you have full control over the order in which you draw your cards, interesting and actually quite good fun, looking forward to more gsmes of this and will definatly be looking for the expansion

Ohhhh I really like the card/deck/hand management mechanic here. Its really quite clever, I am not sure I agree with deck builder as a description of the mechanic, but then it doesn't really fit as hand management either, its a sort of amalgam of the two which really works nicely and adds an unique and interesting set of decisions to each game turn, as you MUST carefully consider the three workers you pick for the turn, but be careful in which workers you choose to leave for the following turns, get stuck with a hand without a master and you could find you options very reduced.


Point salad type scoring at the end with lots going on, however after a round or two game play flows well and is fairly intuative. Worker placement and majority scoring round out the game to give reason to the card mechanic making and overall enjoyable experience.

Touted as a deck building game, yet the mechanic is not overpowering, since there is a heavy presence of area control & resource management.  The hand size is 3 cards which can be chosen each round of 3 turns, from your deck so that you are planning your plays.

We really like this game.  Firstly it looks fantastic - The large board is beautifully drawn, as are the cards, and the bright colours (player pieces and cloth tiles) really augment the look.

Gameplay is a sort of deck building (developing your worker deck) with area majority control (end game bonuses for hall majorities etc) and consists of playing three, or more if recruited this round, workers over seven rounds (Apprentice, Journeyman or Master) to perform a primary action such as acquire cloth or make a dress.  Each character also has a secondary action which can twist the rules slightly.  These secondary actions become more powerful as new workers become available to hire each round.

Absolutely fantastic. Almost a perfect Euro. There are so many paths to victory and different strategies that each game will always be different. I don't mind the employee cards being repetitive each game. It gives you the chance to try different strategies. And with an expansion coming out very soon with 28 new cards, replayability will increase even more. The only thing I don't care for is the victory point tokens. A score track or score board would have been much better. A minor complaint that doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the game. Find this one and get it!

Nem jött be annyira. Végig teljesen fresco érézsem volt. Ugyan van a mechanikákban is hasonlóság, de nem igazán emiatt, hanem azért, mert az egész egy uncsi kockamenedzselés. Egyértelműen pure mechanizmus volt csak a játék tervezési fázisban, és utólag lett tematizálva. Ezek alapján már csak az a rejtély, hogy miért pont ez lett a téma, amivel egyértelműen csomó játékost vesztenek. Gondolhatnánk, hogy valakiket vesztenek, de másokat meg megynernek vele, azonban annál sokkal gémerebb a játék, hogy bárkit is bevonzanak az "utcáról" csak a témával.
Node nekem nem a témája fáj igazán, hanem a témátlansága.

Kiegészítés: a mechanizmussal azonban nincs semmi gond, akinek nem fáj a téma vagy éppen annak a hiánya, annak mindenképp ajánlott kategória, mert valóban sok mindenen lehet agyalni menet közben. Szerencsére a játékidő is ideális.

A táblát érdemes lett volna kicsit olvashatóbbá tenni, mert vannak rajta nagyon zavaró hibák.

Rokoko is pretty much just another standard Euro game but it is a well-tailored one. It combines a number of established mechanisms (most notably area majorities and deck-building) to create a festival that - despite illusions of opulence and abundance - has too little of everything but paint and pretty dresses. As usual you always have one action less than you need and not enough money in any case.

I don't think Rokoko has what it takes to become a favourite as it's missing that special spark. I am also a little unsure about its replayability, especially since the deck of tailor cards is exactly the same each play (although possibly in slightly different order). Like with Pillars of the Earth this is easily fixed with a small expansion but possibly annoying. For now, however, I'm happy to play.

All the marks of a good game. Honestly, I avoided this for the very same sexist reason most game players avoid it: the theme. There are some themes I can just look over but dress-making was a tough pill to swallow. But I'm glad I finally took the dive because honestly the theme isn't problematic at all when you really start to think about how recycled sci-fi and medieval themes have become. This game does something different and does it well! All the mechanics work very well together and I like the card play and the various actions you can take. Great artwork. The scoring is a little fiddly and new players might forget about little things here and there regarding scoring that will matter at the end; but other than those points I think Rococo is highly enjoyable and a very tight, intelligent worker placement game!

This game is beautiful and the theme is unique, which I like.  The problem is the mechanic that forces you to pursue a specific track that is not part of the theme of the game.  You cannot win without advancing in the "fireworks."  This is a mechanic that I dislike; I like freedom in games and I like the possibility to win using multiple different methods/mechanics/tracks.

Based on two unfinished plays (~50-60% done). 
A very good game. The graphic design, iconography etc. is superb.
The mechanics are a nice blend of old ones with a touch of the new way of deck-building. And this part of the game is probably the most interesting - cause the card play is not so obvious. Very, very intriguing, with a lot of deep and agonizing decisions.
The most funny part is that you almost never are on the edge - you don't feel the shortage of resources. On the other hand - having them as many as you really want - to obtain a better result than opponent is a hard task to do. I like it. It is a very different take on the game, than I used to. I like it. Definitely a keeper.

Don't never ever play this game with 4 players or more. No, no, no!

The designers and publishers really took a bit of a gamble with the theme. Who knows, dependent on sales, they may wish that they had stuck to a more traditional setting. But, I for one, congratulate them for daring to try something new. Although, at the same time, I cannot help but wish that the actual game mechanics felt a little more innovative. The much admired card mechanics, for instance, reminds me quite a lot of Pillars of the Earth (which was around long before the term deck building had even been coined) 

If you are fed up with bashing orcs, trading on the high seas or exploring strange new worlds then why not try a little tailoring. It may not be a perfect 10, or dressed up to the nines but it certainly manages a slinky 8.

Rokoko is Euro down to the bone. Hand-management, deck-building, resource conversion, area majority, and end-game multipliers. It all comes together in a unique package with the theme of being tailors making fancy dresses and coats for a ball in belle-epoque France. This does not matter one lick. 

I wanted to like this game because it's a Cramer game and because he went out on a limb with the theme. But, there's very little player interaction other than buying up cards, goods, dresses, etc. before your opponents or vying for spots on the different floors. Not to mention, you get very few in-game points meaning you're more or less churning along, trying (and failing) to do the mental calculation of who's winning. It's not an overly long game but I didn't want to wait two hours to find out I was a distant third. Finally, a lot of the game hinges on card-buying/playing but the cards themselves are rarely that exciting. 

Haven't played Krafwagen yet but, when I stack the two side-by-side, I fail to see why Rokoko garnered so much buzz while Kraftwagen just withers.

I'm dropping my rating slightly after a second play. I still think the game is awesome and I'm still very interested in incorporating the Jewelry Box expansion in future plays. But after just two plays, I believe there is a most efficient way to victory and the game will really only shine if four very experienced players are playing it. The fact that the card deck comes out in essentially the same order each game exacerbates this as seasoned players can plan for what will come out. At first glance, it appears as if the area control aspect is the be all, end all, of scoring, but in reality area control may give you less than 25% of your total points and diversifying your outfits by both room, type and color is far more important (assuming you claim decorations in the statue and terrace areas). In the end, I still love this game and will play it anytime, but I can't place it among the very best as it is not as dynamic from play to play as I would like.

Rococo is at the "top of the bell curve" among the classic German-style Euro puzzle games. Collect resources to fulfill contracts that allow you to rent out spaces to control areas for points. The hand management mechanic is fun, but there is almost too much freedom for this style of efficiency game. The game is well done with good artwork, but doesn't leave as positive an impression as others in the genre.

A pretty good design and a well-balanced "point salad". Although the main source of victory points is making dresses, these can score in several ways, and the ball "decorations" are a nice complementary path. Interestingly, the game has some deck building, but none of the annoying shuffling that typically comes with it. The theme isn't exactly exciting (or not at all, to be honest), but Michael Menzel's art makes it better. Only one gripe about the production: there should be a couple more disks of each color, as it is not rare that a player runs out of them.

A good game for sure and a very nice and refreshing theme! I'm not into dresses and such, but it still holds the game up.

There are plenty options and strategys available, while the rules are not that complex. The only downside I found was the luck that comes from the cards that come into play each turn. You can be very lucky when you are first player, or get nothing interesting.

Away from that, it's a good mix of known mechanisms.

Rococo combines the talents of the Malz family with Matthias Cramer in a game about making dresses in the time of Louis XIV.

Naturally, the thing is a terrific success, and the best game I have played by either team of designers.

Rococo is definitely a point-salad type of a game, but it doesn't play as lean and mean as Bora Bora, but perhaps a bit more like Bruges, to compare it to recent Feld games of a similar style.

Players use employee cards to form hands and take actions, and possibly bonus actions.

Actions vary between hiring and loaning out employees, collecting materials for dresses, making dresses, paying out for decorations in court, or gaining the Queen's favor.

Different actions can bring different points- there are actually not so many ways to gain prestige points in the 7 rounds of active play, but by taking control of areas (with dresses made), or donating decorations (statues, fountains and musicians), and by hiring some key employees towards the end of the game players create a number of different ways of gaining Prestige points. (Excess cash also counts towards prestige.)

So going back to my examples, the employee cards create actions for players (like Bruges), but the points and areas are controlled on the game board (like Bora Bora or Rialto), and the employee cards (unless debuted) stay in the players' hands (somewhat like Dominion).

On a first play this is all somewhat confusing, but it adds up to a quick-moving game where players alternate actions and grab advantages, moving towards the endgame and the totaling up of Prestige.

I really enjoyed my first play, even though I don't think I grasped any particular strategies that are superior to others.

I'm starting this at a solid 7.5, for a terrific, fun, and quite lovely game on an unlikely subject.

A very originally-themed Euro, one that I would have loved to death about ten years ago, but which is now no more than ok. It tries to combine worker placement with deck building, and to some extent succeeds, but there's no pressing need to deck trim, indeed some cards offer bonuses for a large workforce. It can be a bit point salad-y, lots of things score points it's just a question of being efficient.

One of several no-shuffle deckbuilders introduced in 2013.  This one forces you to go through your entire deck before refreshing, unlike others which reward you for playing as many cards as possible (Concordia) or punish you for failing to use all your cards (Lewis & Clark).  Theme is original, art is beautiful, gameplay is smooth. Of the four games in this genre (also counting City of Iron), I think this is the lightest, most accessible, and perhaps the most elegant.

Based on set collections mechanics, Rokoko added deck building systems. In the Rokoko, the basic deck building mechanic is brilliantly twisted. It feel a bit different from other classic deck building systems. It can be appealed to someone who are looking for a new and freshness. However, the game is still a part of set collections. It feels only the game theme is changed to me.  While playing this, Rokoko is a set collection games, but the theme is different only. Also, the game takes quite long time. In my first game with 5 players, it took more than 3 hours. Until now, I still want to play other classic set collection games which has shorter playing time and easier rules. This game not appealed so much to me.

RATING: 7
This game has a lot of aspects of modern euros that I don't like -- multiple ways to score and multiple special power cards that you can buy, which together amount to a math equation that you have to redo all game long -- but the area majority aspect partly saves it. One cares what the other players are doing! There's majority scoring for rooms, plus who-gets-to-it-first for fabrics, dresses, and decorations. And all the special-power stuff is explained pretty well in terms of the icons and graphic design. Kind of reminds me of Village, not in terms of any mechanics, rather that it's a fairly abstract and not-that-simple game that manages to pull of a general feeling of "OK, that makes sense." 

Plus, I like it when a game has as silly a theme as this one does. (Begin game explanation with "In this game, we're holding big, lavish balls"; wait for chortle. If chortle is not heard, reconsider your game group :-)

I liked the card management aspect, and it gets around my main complaint against the more standard strategic deck builders by letting you chose your hand out of all the cards in your draw pile rather than just drawing at random. It lets you plan but still punishes you for having a lot of mediocre cards in your deck. The game itself is a bit straightforward; you're collecting resources and trading them in for things worth points. And money never really felt that tight. In that regard it felt pretty standard, but there are a decent number of different ways to score points you have to balance against each other, and the act of balancing these makes the game pretty interesting.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (March 2014)

Very good initial impression, Matthias Cramer is a good designer and now I want to play more of his games.

Rococo is a gorgeous game with great theme. Some friends mocked us for liking the game so there is some resistance against playing this in my current game group due to its theme (Pret a Porter has similar problems), but I DO like the theme. The art and game components are also very well done. 

The game is very easy to teach, it doesn’t have any complex rules, however it has some deep/interesting decisions (which actions do I play? which cards do I use? Do I sell or rent a dress? Which material do I pick? Which dress do I make? And more). All things considered, Rococo has a satisfying medium weight, but flows (more or less) quickly. 
 
I think this is best as a 3 player game, with 4 players I felt some downtime. I don’t want to play it with the full complement of 5 players.

I love deck building games, and although Rococo felt very different than most deck building games I have played, I still liked this facet a lot. It also has area control (another plus for me).

I’m worried about the orange cards (VPs generators) as the players who are first in the turn order can pick them up. I know you can try to be first the next round with the Queen, however some of those cards offer up to 11 VPs so I’m not convinced this is entirely fair. This can be extended to the whole workers for hire deck, some of them are way better than the others (overpowered). This is the only luck aspect that bothers me so far. To summarize this point, I’m worried that being first is too powerful and unbalanced. I will review this point with further plays. 

Current Rating: 7.0

2014-06-09

After more plays, I see that I was correct. Some cards are much more powerful than the others. The worst offenders IMO are the cards, that as a bonus, allow you to make a dress (very powerful) or decorate at a discount (powerful). Also the orange (VP generator) cards are very unbalanced.  The players who got them have a huge advantage and to get them you need to go first in the round. In fact going first seems to be the best decision you can make 90% of the time. If you disregard this you will probably lose and that means that going first is a dominant strategy (no brainer). I really dislike this so I’m downgrading Rococo´s rating. 

The workers for hire will be the same every game AND will appear in the same round so replayability is also low.

To summarize I loathe the unfairness of the cards and the obvious decision of going first. I really liked every other aspect of the game except the so called “deck building”. It breaks the game for me and I suspect with more plays Rococo will continue to slide down in my personal ratings. 

Current Rating: 6.0

I played it again and this time I chose go first every round I wasn’t the first player.  I won so it appears my thesis has some fundament. Going first is very powerful as it allows you to get the most powerful cards in the game. It is true you pay them at full cost, but this drawback is not enough to compensate for their power.

I don’t want to play Rococo again the near future.

It's an OK/Good game. I like the central card mechanic and the theme feels fresh. However, the end-game scoring is far too complicated for its own good. Trying to explain it all resulted in glazed looks all around.

With the hundreds of other games I own, I'm struggling to see what this game really adds to the collection. It gives me the Fresco vibe - and is arguably better - but with the added scoring complexity, I think this one would draw the short straw.

I really like this game. I've only played it once, but it uses an interesting deck building mechanism to augment what is basically and area control game. The art is gorgeous, and the theme works.

Update: This game continues to impress. 4 plays in and I'm bumping it up to an 8. The design allows for so many different strategies; every time I play I see something else I want to try to focus on.

Initial rating of 7 to be a bit conservative, but I expect this might rise to an 8 with more plays. Looking forward to playing again with various player counts and also the Jewelry Box expansion.

A second play was enough for me to decide that the game is not really a keeper for me. Selling/trading away.

A little bit of area control, worker placement (sans workers to place), hand management, deck building/management, resource management and some economic engine building, all in a game about dress making. A lot of stuff in there but it really, really works well together.

I've played it 2-player and 4-player, and it works for both; I can imagine it will work well as 3-player, though I'm not sure about 5-player. Be warned, though, that 2-player is kinda cut-throat.

Another Dominion-lite mechanichs but still interesting, with a complex scoring system. Maybe the last cards provide too many points.

After 7 plays, I upgraded this to 8.5 from 7.5. Yes, it is another themeless eurogame, but its mechanics works perfectly well, the randomness is law, it has perfect scability from 3 to 5 players (not played with 2 yet), and the leader is unclear until the end. Great tension.

Rococo is fun.  Resource management, worker placement, area control, deck building- all of these are present in some measure in the game. It's many paths to victory make it thoughtful and engaging- if somewhat open when playing with just 2p.  Rococo's unique and well-implemented theme, it's cerebral play, and its top-notch components all combine to make a very interesting game that is worth checking out.

Rokoko at times is like a two-hour long Dominion when you know that your deck is not working as good as it should while others already buy province by province. Especially the dreaded deck-thinning rears its ugly face. But then there's more to Rokoko. There's a relevant board where you're battling for majorities or certain bonusses. It's action selection where you can gather resources and work on improving your deck. There's money to be managed. All efforts to catch up might be in vain as Rokoko rewards long-term strategy but each turn it grants enough room for tactical manoeuvering to keep players engaged.
It's a well-crafted game and my first play was ok. As all strategic engine-builders, only repeated plays will show if I really enjoy it (RFTG, Saint Petersburg) or if it's not for me (Dominion, Stone Age).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The interaction of mechanics is clean, new, and immensely interesting. It is a new spin on deck building (your deck is tiny, and gets played through a lot) It also executes its theme nicely while crafting an interesting set of mechanics to play around with.

Love the card play in this game, and the price decreasing with the choices. This is a solid game, with tough decisions. What keeps it from a 10 is the lack of variable set-up: having the same cards available every game makes some strategies (e.g. the 11 card deck) annoyingly powerful, and unavoidable.

Myślałem ze ta gra zupełnie mi nie podejdzie (gra o szyciu sukienek?) Ale okazała się bardzo fajna pozycja. Ciekawie zastosowany mechanizm deckbuildingu w połączeniu z area control daje dużo satysfakcji podczas rozgrywki. Punktowane na koniec jest trochę zakrecone, ale można ogarnąć. Minusem może być to,  ze po kilku partiach gra moze stać się powtarzana,  gdyż w każdej partii wykorzystujemy wzzystkie karty w podobnej kolejności.

Dec/16 Initial rating: 7.5. An interesting game, with an interesting theme. Even though it's only 3 actions per 7 rounds (with occasionally more) there is quite a bit to consider.

RATING: 5
Send your workers out to buy fabrics, hire tailors/seamstresses, curry favour, hire other workers, etc.
Giving the workers different powers works really well. You can only use so many workers and you want the gold/master workers to get access to all the spots yet the bronze and silvers/trainees and journeymen can have such very useful powers...

Beyond that there's also some area control and stuff.

Straight up deckbuilding euro where every turn you choose which cards to draw from your deck. Sounds really broken but it plays really well. There are a lot of things to do but there is not many actions so every turn is important. Do you chase assistants with great powers or reliable masters with not exciting ones. Good game with a great theme.

11-26-13 - Not the most unique mechanics in the world, but they are put together and used in a way that feels fresh. The hand management aspect is interesting as you only get 3 cards in a hand and build you current hand as well as potential future hands. Nice and that is probably the most different aspect of the game from others I've played. Scoring is also interesting as the bulk is done after the game is over (it's hard to tell sometimes who is in the lead until you score at the end). Really enjoyed it, even if it is about making dresses. :-/  haha  And on that note, this is one of the prettier games we own, which really does go a long way. Solid 8. 

11-27-2013 - Wrote a review and while considering the mechanics and game play decided to bump it to a 9.  Awesome game.

05-05-2014 - If Tzolkin is (was) a 10 in my collection, this needs to be a 10 as well.  Not that I compare it to Tzolkin in any way, just on a personal enjoyment note I enjoy it as much as if not more than Tzolkin.  WTG Rococo, you've enamored me with your fancy duds.

+ Lots of competition between resources and area majorities
+ Good mix of strategy and tactics
+ Deck building element without shuffling
+ Thematic (everything seems to make thematic sense)

- Can take a long time to finish (I'm not sure If I would like to play it with more than 3 people but it's also not the best as a 2 player game).
- AP inducing for some
- Tedious final scoring

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I really enjoyed my first experience outside of the AP that some people experienced from time to time causing our first game to go about 3 hours. This one shouldn't be 3 hours long. The game is an interesting blend of a slight bit of deckbuilding, area majority, special scoring, and economy as one considers which of 6 actions to take (or in some case, less than 6 actions as many of the cards are apprentices or journeymen which are limited to less actions). Rules are clear and concise, colors are bright, and the symbols are pretty clear.

Ein Deckbuilder Spiel der Superlative!
Ganz so schlimm ist es nicht, aber mit der Erweiterung musst du leider an 1.000 Sachen denken die du erhälst, sobald du das und das machst. So ist es mir oft passiert, dass ich noch dran dachte solange die Mitspieler dran waren, aber mir den Ring dann nicht kaufte als ich dran war, weil ich es einfach vergessen hatte.
Es ist kein gewöhnlicher Deckbuilder, denn aus seinem Nachziehstapel darf man pro Runde immer 3 Karten heraussuchen und die verwenden... man zieht nicht zufällig. Zusätzlich bekommt man gekaufte Karten auf die Hand und kann sie im selben Zug nochmals einsetzen. Dabei gibt es grundsätzlich 3 verschiedene Kartentypen: Den Meister, der alle Aktionen vom Schneidern bis zum Einkauf auf dem Markt alles machen darf, der Geselle, der zwar keine neuen Personen (Karten) anwerben (ins Deck kaufen) darf, aber sonst fasst alles machen darf und der Lehrling darf eigentlich nur Garn und Stoff und Seide einkaufen.
Mir gefällt das Spiel sehr gut und die Erweiterung ist ebenfalls super thematisch eingebunden und funktioniert auch mechanisch perfekt, sie ist nur zu viel dran zu denken. Nachdem ich ein Kleid geschneidert habe, darf ich noch Schmuck kaufen, falls ich vorher ein Marker da hin gelegt habe. Wenn mein Geselle das Kleid geschneidert hat bekomme ich einen Marker auf mein Ausbildungstabloe, wenn das der letzte Marker war darf ich mir einen neuen Meister heraussuchen und und und! Beim Grundspiel habe ich ein Kleid geschneidert und hatte die Wahl: Verkaufen für Geld oder einsetzten für Siegpunkte -> Ende.
Somit spiele ich gerne das Grundspiel mit, aber auch die Erweiterung falls das wer unbedingt möchte. Finde aber, dass das ein Spiel ist, das keine Erw. benötigt.

One my favorite midweight Euros! It takes a game or two to really grok all the possible ways to score, but once you do there are multiple paths to victory so you're never completely SOL due to a poor decision or someone else's move. The area-control section and mentally running your opponents' scores keep the game tense enough to be interesting, and it has a fresh, fun theme that works great with the mechanics. A few more plays may make it a perfect ten for me.

My rating represents more my unwillingness to play this again than the quality of the game (which I would only rate slightly better though).

My main points are:

1. There is nothing you can do while the others are taking their turns, no planning whatsoever is possible

2. Turn order is crucial, yet if you are behind, there is nothing you can do to prevent the players before you to take turn order. Also it's quite random who happens to get second and so on. I think the whole turn order should be auctioned or set in a Caylus-like manner.

3. The game doesn't feel thematic at all, and even if it would the theme doesn't appeal to me in the slightest.

It is a very standard "gather resources, score points" game (despite trying to add layers, like area majority and extra effects to differentiate your workers).

The good thing about this game is it's original theme. Dressing people to go to a ball is not common in game-land.

The game offers many ways to score points but its main mechanism is majority scoring. 

If you think away the beautiful artwork, you are actually optimizing a matrix of points. I feel some slight resemblance with [thing=38992][/thing].

Nevertheless, the game is exciting and there are a lot of things to think about when choosing your actions but not too many. Of course some deck building needed to be present, in this post-Dominion era. 

With 5 players there is a big disadvantage of being 5th in play order. It also took long and too much down time. With 2, the game felt much more aggressive, and you have less time to think what you will do. 

Considering that the author is [person=34699][/person], and I loved most of his previous games, this game came a bit as a disappointment. But that had everything to do with my high expectations. Because, it's certainly not a bad game. There are not too many (well balanced) options to choose from and all of them are clearly illustrated on the board.

Oh and did i already mention that the artwork looks great! (although some people may think differently about it)

Minus: 3 (duration) - 6 - 9

RATING: 8
In perfect keeping with the theme, the gameboard is a riot of colours and can be a bit overwhelming at first. At first glance, the game itself might seem like a typical victory point hodge-podge, but my one play so far convinced me that there is a lot more to this one. Using and upgrading your action cards is a neat puzzle to solve, and the dilemma of choosing stuff first for lots of gold or sweeping up leftovers on the cheap is ingenious and very well implemented.

Everything else just hangs together very well without being flashy, and since I have a lot more respect for good development than for good design, this fits perfectly with my tastes. I would have to play a couple more times before I could decide whether this one might be a purchase for me (mostly to see whether the staggered action cards make the game too scripted), but for now I’m very optimistic.

Great fun! Only played once so far (2 player with my wife), but I definitely felt a positive tension throughout the game. It did not feel "feminine" and I actually quite liked the theme--something different. The scoring is a little funky with the multipliers, but once you get through your first game, I think you will appreciate that it's there. The scoring certainly makes the game a little meatier.

Update 1/27/15: We hadn't played this one in 6 months. It's one of those games that you definitely have to brush up on the rules if you haven't played in a while. It's not that it's rules heavy, it's just that it is not the most elegant/intuitive game out there. There are so many things I like about this game, but I'm not sure if I love anything (maybe the board art). It's definitely solid, and well though out, but it just doesn't quite have that "x factor" for me, at least not yet.

Anna didn't like the theme, and we're both not big on deckbuilding (although it's only a light mechanic here). I like the board though and hope to get it to the table once more. Wouldn't say no to a good trade offer though, since it just won't stand much chance with so many other games we like more.

Sold Nov'15 because I couldn't get it to the table. If storage space was not limited, I would've kept it.

RATING: 6
Rating based on one play. Each round felt the same despite the deck building aspect and the game doesn't really build to a crescendo. Usually that doesn't bother me, but it did in this case.

Not sure I'm a fan of the new hire cards coming out in order by rank. It makes the game less chaotic than I prefer. I would rather shuffle all cards as one group at the beginning of the game (except for end game VP cards).

I do see how familiarity with the new hire cards can lead to varied strategies. Plus, there are some difficult choices to make. All in all, it's a lukewarm 7 from me. Nothing super memorable about this one.

Incidentally, Rococo feels like Bruxelles 1893 meets Copycat.

Update: upgraded to 8 after 5 plays. There is a lot more in this game than what seems at first sight. Choose and value your cards well, that's the key.

Solid majority game. Have to wait and see how long it will remain fresh. The same cards appear every game. For now, interesting enough to further explore.
The board is in typical Michael Menzel-style: too dark and too little contrast.

Took way longer to play than it should, but a very well-oiled Euro efficiency/ multipoint grab game.  Not knowing the end game scoring cards made it a bit random at the end for us, but if we know this now and play again that could be mitigated.  Lots of parts and 101 ways to score, and overall a good game with an excellent rulebook, but nothing that makes it stand out from a Vinhos, Kanban, or such games so it will not be added to my shelf but would happily play again.

Unique, strategic, and shockingly competitive.  Squeezing points from a limited number of resources and turns is an engaging challenge.  Requires a mix of careful thought and flexibility.

I never thought a game about making dresses would ever hit the 9 rating for me, but this one hits on all cylinders for me.  Deck building without randomness.  Engine building.  Tight but not overly restrictive resource management.  Many options for earning points for victory.  A fun game for Dads to play with daughters. A keeper for sure.  What keeps it from a 10 is the lack of a points track on the outside of the board.  Using chits for points doesnt work well.  It would be nice to have extra Master/Journeyman/Apprentice cards available also such that there can be some game variation.

"Very fun game by Mathias Kramer, where players are renaissance tailors! yes, it's an area control game with dresses ... I really love all the little mechanics and ideas that Kramer has incorporated -- area control with a great twist on deckbuilding, and the actions/turns are kept so wonderfully tight -- but the end-game scoring just feels anticlimactic after such a fun game"

(all plays so far 2-3 player) A great medium-weight euro with a wonderful blend of mechanics (area control, deck-building, resource management, action selection) and they all fit together seamlessly. 

Fairly deep strategy, but you need to play tactically, because timing things right so your opponent doesn't get your spot or resources or card can be very important. Games have seemed pretty tight, with scores being pretty close. Love the fresh theme, I have no problems playing a game about dresses and fancy balls.  

Only negatives so far are the replayability factor, as the game doesn't change much from one to the next. Also, the components seem nice, but I don't like the VP chips.  I would have rather had a score track, as the tokens are just one more fiddly thing for set-up and take down, and it can be hard to find the right one since they're one-sided.

The board is beautiful and the game is great...

The deck building aspect of the game is awesome because you don't draw cards, you take all the cards from your deck that aren't on your discard pile and select 3 to use this round... this eliminates the luck of the draw and you can plan what to do...

Also when you hire then workers they go to your hand giving you more actions on that turn...

RATING: 5
Euro-style with points scattered across the board in different areas blending in play scoring, end of game scoring, and decisions between tactical straight points and strategic play towards larger points.

Includes cards which serve as your workers, each with have a different power.  Unlike Bruges, which I loath and is certainly not the same type of game, but is similar in being points salad and using cards to move towards comboing point, the cards in Rokoko are easier to grasp and mostly balanced.  There's also a blocking mechanism that you can use to take cards before others get them, but this must be weighed against the cost of the card, the cost of having that card in your hand-cycle, and the cost of losing a turn to get that card.  

So, where games like London and Bruges can explode into chaos with various card combos, Rokoko keeps it contained.  Has somewhat of a deck building component, but I like that you get to chose the cards and you can fire them from your hand, though this takes one of your turns to do.

A few things I didn't like:  1) A few cards are overpowered.  One allows for the conversion of money to points without cap.  2) On the first turn, where player order is randomly determined, the later players in the round are at an immediate disadvantage.  The best fabric and workers are picked up before their turn and typically, by the time their third worker is ready to be used (usually their last turn of the round) there isn't many if any useful choices to make - most dresses are constructed, most fabrics purchased, most workers hired.  So likely you just fire the card and jettison it from the deck.  3) Very little player interaction.  For me, this is very boring.  I still got to trash talk people, but it was just me being a jerk, nothing that the game brings to the table.  4) Given the various methods for scoring points, it takes a large amount of effort to determine where you are in relation to other players.  

For a points salad game, I like more than most.  In terms of my taste of games, this is something I would play if somebody busted it out, but I wouldn't buy it and there are way funner games.  Good components, decent art, easy to understand rules, nothing that is too fiddly.

A very good euro game implementing a fresh baroque theme. My wife loves how your are making dress in this game, and the area control decision is great. Play a baroque theme on the background, and this game will shine.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The theme is great! It's different (making dresses and contributing to the decorations for a ball), and the actions you take during the game tie into that theme well (e.g., to make a dress, you first need to acquire the correct materials, and then only a master or journeyman-level employee can make the dress.)

However, I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would before playing. First, the game seemed a bit too 'loose'.  This game presents you with a lot of options -- and I typically enjoy a lot of options -- but for some reason, in this game the difference between all of the choices didn't seem especially compelling. I'm not really sure why.

The second reason I didn't enjoy it as much as I expected is that I had compared this to Lewis & Clark due to the main mechanic of the game: using the deck of employees you built to perform actions, and then reshuffling them later on. I really like Lewis & Clark, I feel like this mechanic is more interesting in that game than in Rococo (i.e., more difficult decisions about how and when to use each person in your deck, and deciding when to camp in L&C vs. no such decision in Rococo).

So, overall, I still enjoy the game. But for a game with this type of mechanic, I still prefer Lewis & Clark. I'm not sure yet whether or not Rococo will remain in the collection long-term.

RATING: 6.6
Worker placement with dress making theme. Reminds me of Fresco from the different colour materials needed to make the dresses but there is no “fun” element of waking up your workers. There is a small deck building element to the game and you use the worker placement to build your deck cards. The game is a very solid worker placement game which is easy to learn but the 7 rounds can seem quite long as not a lot changes from round to round.

This one burned out really quickly for me. This came out right around the time that Concordia and Lewis & Clark did, and I think Rococo is easily the best of the three. That being said, it got a bit repetitive after a few plays. Plus the expansion did the game no favors, and as silly as it sounds, a poor expansion can ruin the base game's experience for me. 

Would ultimately just rather play Lords of Waterdeep for a recipe-fulfillment Euro.

After a partial game at Essen 13, I put this down as just another mid range Eurogame. It could be any one of a dozen other games.

But the more I think about it, the more I think I've missed a trick. The card drafting, hiring and firing is very cool. The game builds as your skills build.

I am keen to play more.

Initial rating 6.5, but I expect that to increase.

Kind of okay hand management/deckbuilding/area majority kinda game.

Liked it okay at first but got old quick too.

There's some bad disconnect in theme with the statues representing caterers (or something). The designer has some spurious logic he's written about how the fits together that sounds a bit made up after the fact, frankly.

Rahdo explains the issue pretty well in his final thoughts video review about this. I agree and it bugged the hell out of us, and game never hits the table.

So glad I didn't let my lack of interest in the theme keep me from trying this gem. 

Elegant in both it's gameplay and production this feels very much like a classic Feld design. Middle weight Euro with straightforward enough rules that it can be enjoyed from the very first play but with enough depth to satisfy even jaded gamers.

Works very well across the full player count which is also a nice bonus.  

An easy recommendation given that every person I've shared it with thus far has enjoyed it.

Liked this, if not FrankenEuro, at least greatest hits of modern euro game. You've got a bit of deck-building, area majority, point salad, (optional) set collection, and worker placement (of a sort...more at worker deployment, but still with the chasing limited resources thing). It does that thing where 90+% of the points are scored at the end, so it's crucial that on a first play, everyone has at least an idea of what scores points. Given the plenitude of scoring options, and the general tendency of people to forget things, I foresee lots of "you didn't tell me that!" at the end of the 2 hours.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
Three games and no wins in, I'm enjoying Rococo a LOT.  There seems to be a couple of dominant strategies, but none are sole candidates for victory.  The hardest part is understanding the exceptions for different worker types (and they're written on the board) and the rules/order for dismissing employees (which aren't that complicated, but seem to trip everyone up the first time they play).

It won't replace Pret a Porter for tight economic dress-making games, but it's quite fun.

A game that is perfectly fine in how it plays, but I felt that it lacked player interaction and was a little too random as you could not garner a strategy or forward plan as ultimately it is down to the tile draw.
The deck building element is good and the game flows well.
There is just not enough here to suggest I would play this over the many other games out there that are better.

Pretty balanced (seems so) eurogame, with plenty of options and ways to achieve victory. Plenty of elements: worker placement, area control, hand management, deck building, set collection, etc.

Rococo is flamboyantly presented, and its attempts to put some theme to the process are cute. It's about as enjoyable as any others of the enormous Euro-glut of identikit games released at this time. But really, this is just a 'spread your points out thinly' action-selection exercise where you hope to trick into the right combo before anyone else. Been there, seen it, done that.

[b]Rococo[/b] was sold via auction 10/15/16.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> 8)[/COLOR]

[i]After sitting on my shelf for months after my only play I ended up selling my copy to someone in my game group. It was not because I don't enjoy the game, but knowing that it'll never hit the table at my house. I know that I'll still be able to play occasionally since someone in our group has a copy and that'll be enough for me. I really enjoyed the game, but there are other area control games I'd rather play so I'm not upset that I don't still own this one.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- You get to play as a tailor/seamstress! Personally I am a fan of designers thinking outside the box when choosing a theme for their games.
- Similar in some ways to Concordia there isn't a random card draw, instead you choose three cards to play each round (you do have to cycle through all your cards before choosing cards you just played).
- Deeper than it appears, the decision of which cards to play when is critical if you want to be successful.
- Great integration of hand management, inventory management, dress making and area control... definitely an unexpected montage of theme and mechanics.

I finally managed to play Rococo after acquiring a copy months ago; it was a four player game. The game took us two hours, two of us were new to the game so I'm hoping successive plays will be quicker. I was surprised by how deep Rococo was, for some reason I was expecting a lighter game. I love the hand management aspect of the game, I totally botched my last turn but I wouldn't have it any other way since you are never beholden to a random card draw. Add to that the theme and area control portion of the game and Rococo is a winner for me.

However; I unfortunately don't know if Rococo will stick around in my collection. I thought this would be a game I could play with my family, but I'm not convinced they will like it. My wife won't appreciate all the different parts of the game you have to juggle, she definitely prefers games with a more straight forward decision tree. Second the game length could be a killer. We have other games we love that sit in a similar time frame and it is difficult to get those to the table and I'm not sure Rococo can contend with those games. I'm going to try and play with my kids at least once and see what they think of the game, hopefully I'm wrong and they'll enjoy the game I guess we'll see where things stand a year from now.[/i]

Who doesn't like making dresses and getting ready for a ball? Rococo is from the same designer as Lancaster, another great game, and just like Lancaster, Rococo is all about the timing, not necessarily the person who has the most "cards" or actions. I squeaked out a victory in a little two player game with Paulo but it was tense the whole time. Great, engaging, with a beautiful board and components. Not as complicated as it looks and the strategy is fairly straight-forward which, this time, is going to count against it. Yeah, that may be unfair but all the dresses look the same and I expected more, I don't know...intrigue! Or something. But Rococo is fun.

A standard gather resources and build VP earning stuff with it type game, but it's nicely put together. 7 rounds. 3 actions per turn, plus another for card you buy that round. It's a first in-first served game, so the pressure is on to notice what other people are collecting, and either get to the dresses you want first or go for something else. Dresses are a means of you putting your pawns out into an area majority process for end-game scoring, which will serve as the basis for most points. There's a bunch of other ways to score points to give it a bit of smorgasbord feel, either via card powers or on "decorative" spots where you can just put out a pawn in a straight money for points way. Scores will inevitably be close as a result. The 7 rounds are just a means of re-setting the things you can buy, as your area-majority board presence keeps building and you can carry over resources between rounds. The basis of taking actions is using your hand of employees, who start out pretty basic. Each turn a new set of employee cards are available for purchase which will give you a souped up power each time you play it. The further you get into the game, the more souped up they are, but of course you haven't as many turns to play them. Another action is to trash your more basic employee cards to earn money and thin your deck, allowing you to get thru your hand quicker and get to do your more powerful cards again. What I really liked about this mechanism is that the cards with the great powers can only do the more basic actions (collect resources, build basic dresses, convert money directly into points). Cards with no, or more basic, powers need to be kept to allow you to do the powerful actions (get more employees, build the better dresses and the like). Very neat, and interesting decisions all through the game on how to choose your hand each turn (for the powers or for the more powerful actions) and how and when and if to acquire more. Because those actions to improve your deck are at the cost of actually doing the actions that get you points ... collecting the resources to build the dresses on offer and building them. Stuff to explore there. It's a game of being mindful what others are doing, with interesting decisions along the way on how to earn your VPs most efficiently in such a way that you will be least impacted by other players. A game of quiet observation, but an efficiency game none-the-less, which is not for all. But it's very tidily done.

Eggert did it again! Engaging mechanics, original theme, beautiful looking components. Love how you can do killer-combos with the cards and maximize each round. Not an easy game to explain though and some experienced players had some difficulty wrapping their heads around it. It has a deck-building element in it but it's unlike anything you know, since you can pick any card you like from your own deck, this means you have to carefully plan your picks since you might have to wait two or three rounds till cards come back to your hand... very interesting, beautifully done. Love the game and hope to play it a lot more.

Prefer this over Village (also a great game)

Difficult to explain and lots of elements to teach.

Based on one play: Don't let the theme turn you off, this is a medium Euro with some decent mechanics. The biggest issue is that it gets a little repetitive, it should be a few turns shorter as you repetitively get resources to produces coats and dresses. Some blocking but the main part of the game is how to cycle your cards to get the actions you want.

Rococo is a game about haberdashery!  It's an area control game that uses resource management, but the primary mechanic is a hand management system that's a little like deckbuilding without shuffling.  You have a pool of cards which can be added to or subtracted from, and you choose which cards you use from that pool each turn, but cards can't be re-used until you use all of them.  It was pretty clever, and I thought that everything fit together well.  An enjoyable game.

RATING: 5
Much better with more players. It becomes a tighter fight over dresses, area control is more important and the spaces are more contested over. I don't really like this game that much with 2 players but I'll easily play this with 4 or 5 no questions asked. The deckbuilding part of it is fun but since you're not really adding more than 1 card a turn to your deck, I'm reluctant to really call it that. Neat mechanic that I wouldn't mind seeing elsewhere.

I don't know how much depth is really in this game, but it's quick enough and just barely meaty enough to come back for at least 10 plays. I think that might be my upper threshold for it though.

I liked what father and Son Malz made of Edo and I love the designs of M. Cramer (Glen More, Lancaster and especially Helvetia), so this game was a no brainer: just buy!

Finally played it having some high expectations. Was this such a great game? To be honest, no, therefore there is nothing really refreshing in here, nothing we haven't seen before in an other game. Is it still a good game that I'll gladly play most of the times? Definitely yes! 
This game plays very smooth and is very tense to play as you always have to hope that the item you are aiming for still will be available if it's your turn. I like deck-building a lot and collecting resources is my thing, so what' not to like for me :-)

Hivatalosan 90 perces a játékidő, nekünk sikerült a szabály magyarázaton kívül majd' 4 óráig húzni, igaz ebben vaskosan benne van, hogy még egyikünk sem játszott vele korábban, illetve hogy öten voltunk.
Ezen kívül viszont nem sok rossz dolgot tudok róla elmondani, a játék végig izgalmas volt, még az utolsó körben is sok pontot lehetett szerezni, szóval aki az elején elszámolta magát a végére simán odaérhetett az elejére mivel hét körös a játék.
A játék lényege: XV. Lajos udvarában szabóságokat üzemeltetünk, aki a legtöbb "celebet" :) fel tudja öltöztetni a királyi udvarban, az jó eséllyel pályázhat a győzelemre. Ezen kívül lehetőség van pl. tűzijáték, zenészek, vagy szobrok "szponzorálására" is. 
A lényeg, hogy több út van a győzelemhez ebben a kiváló lehelyezős játékban.

An intense euro game with some minor deckbuilding, some area majority, and some complicated scoring criteria. For example, it could really use a player aid that tracks how many man/woman pairs you have and how many clothes in each color you have as there are bonus cards you can buy if you are fast enough that rewards you for having sets of those things per set. 

In terms of actual gameplay, every action you take is simple, clear, and oozing with the delightful tensions that someone might beat you to your spot or action you are working towards. Very nice game.

Almost like the definition of a generic optimization game with no theme to speak of.

Rating is after only one play and is mostly reflective of my lack of desire to try it again. Just another point salad optimization game, which is kind of sad because there were elements of the game I quite liked. I liked the (partial?) deck building, the unique theme, the dress buying and placement and the set collecting aspects of scoring. I disliked the general "turn resources into points" feel, the stupidly high scores that are unknown until the end, the lack of player interaction (opponent could have been replaced by a random event generator), and the dozens of little mini games you could play to earn points.

Just another boring low interaction points optimization game.

I like it, even if it doesn't bring anything new. There are familiar mechanics married here: some deck building (but not too much), some set collection (again, not too much), some area majority (ditto). But together, it plays very well and every aspect of the game is complementing the others. Some strategy is also involved, but for me, it's mainly a tactical game. 

Plays very well with just two (that's how I play it most of the time), but I have to say it shines with more - the area majority part becomes more meaningful and exciting. With two, there are always good options available; with more, there's a real race for the best materials, workers and dresses. Regardless, I can honestly recommend this to any gaming group, big or small.

Birthday 2016 from Chris and Jess.

I really enjoy the deck-building aspect of this game as its fun to recruit increasingly powerful workers. Its also fun figuring out how to use them in the best way possible as this demands a small degree of planning and its satisfying to see a plan come together.

On the downside there does only seem to be one winning strategy (making lots of dresses) which seems like a bit of a shame. The fountain spots that provide income per dress built also seem a bit over-powered.

I perhaps need to explore it a bit more to determine whether other strategies might be possible. The only ones I can think of would rely upon drawing specific endgame characters (many of which offer bonus points) and that would seem like a rather high-risk approach as astute opponents will inevitably try to steal those characters when/if they come out.

An instant favorite. It's always amusing getting a group of guys together for some fancy dress making, then having a tense worker placement financial battle for the top. Don't let the theme stop you from enjoying one of the best games ever. Also, I find it always helps to warn new players of how powerful those fireworks positions are. With good opponents, they are always first to go. Decorations are expensive, but sometimes it's worth tossing a dress for the cash needed to build one. I like that players are guaranteed to see all of the worker cards throughout the game, so it's easy to plan ahead, while the dresses that are available are pretty random, so there's still a need to adjust your strategy on the fly.
Overall, this is a prized part of my collection that I am eager to teach to new gamers.

Very well designed medium-heavy Euro. The basic of the game is of course ressource-(to-money-)to-VP conversion, but it cleverly combines some contemporary with classic mechanisms. The contemporary one is hand management (in a few aspects comparable to MacGerdt's Concordia): You have a hand of cards of your employees, who will perform basic actions (as gathering ressources or making dresses) for you. But each card also has a special bonus and over the game you hire better employees and try to send the basic ones away. After you have produced a dress, you can put it (or rather the nobleman wearing it) into one of five ballrooms. This works with an area majority mechanism and is the main VP generator.

My impression after the first play (with four players) is that Rokoko is quite on the heavy side of medium Euros. There is to consider which cards to choose (kind of a programming aspect)and in which order the actions to take (that nobody snatches that dress or that employee away). Our game lastet from 120 to 150 minutes; for 90 minutes you would need really fast players. The board feels a bit over-whelming at the beginning, but the iconography is very clear and after two turns you know what is happening at which spot on the board. The art-work by Michael Menzel is great (as expected) and gives the game a soul and facilitates thematic immersion (in this aspect very comparable to Fresco). In total, I recommend this game to fans of modern Euros with a clever combination of different mechanisms.

When I played this, I found it rather bland in everything it set out to do. While it aspired to be a combination of deck building and worker placement as it was advertised where I saw it, two genres I love, it ended up being so sparse in both aspects that neither was enjoyable.

In terms of worker placement, any number of players can allocate their workers to the same locations, leaving very little in the way of strategic placement, blocking, or player interaction. Pretty much everything you do, from picking resources to dress patterns comes from a pool, so while you can't directly block opponents, there is a definite advantage to going first right out of the gates.

The deck building aspect is nearly non-existent. Throughout the entire game, I only ever purchased or trashed a card three times, one of which was selling off my final worker for a few gold pieces for an extra point at the end of the game.

The workers for hire is, in my opinion, the weakest aspect of the game. There are exactly as many workers as the game needs to play, which means you'll see the exact same ones show up every time you play. Even worse, these workers are numbered, meaning they always go out on a certain round and are discarded if not purchased. In other words, not only will you see the same hires every time you'll play, you'll see them all the exact same round as before, essentially making it the same game every time. Veterans of the game will know exactly what round to take first and what round to be ready to hire every time they play, making the game ever less accessible for new players.

Some players out there may actually prefer this method to the randomness in a game like Lords of Waterdeep, but for me, it makes the game feel boring to know exactly what's coming every round.

Overall, I think Rococo sounds great on paper, and there are some good ideas, but overall, none of it's mechanics live up to what they could (or should) be, and the game is bogged down heavily by some very poor decisions, such as the consistent hires. While I tackle a game like Lords of Waterdeep or Dominion differently every time I play it based on what's available, I'd see no reason to try and play Rococo any differently than I have the first time, especially going into the game knowing what and when to hire.

Julia - "This game looks really good, will we get it?"
Me - "Hmmm, a game about making dresses. Nah, I dunno about that"
J - "It won KennerSpiel des Jahres. That's the sign of something really good."
Me - "Can get it if you like, don't know if I'll bother with it"

Well, I did bother enough to read the rules and watch an instruction video before playing. Gathering a group of 5 players (where I got the same "a game about making dresses?" comments that I did myself), we gave it a go.

And every one of us thinks this game has the "wow" factor.

With 6 different actions and possible bonus actions (depending on your hand), there was a little bit of instruction to start. But everyone picked up the concepts really quickly and competition was always fierce for everything.

For me, this game has a bit of, pretty much, everything I could ask for. Element of deck building, resource management, limited actions, ability to obtain first player status, difficult decisions, higher cost for "1st pick" of resources/new staff, ability to screw other players by taking what they wanted :) No-one can have everything and no-one will get everything they want in a turn. Your decisions and strategy will often change, when you see what the player before you has just done. You wanted to buy "that" dress, but the player before you just took two pieces of cloth - which makes the last one free. I might take the free cloth and hope for the dress to still be there....

The quality of the pieces are nice. The artwork is superb. The rulebook looks great and explains everything well. The fact it has a double sided board, to accomodate 2-3 or 4-5 players, is another amazing plus!

So, I'm now suprised to say that I think this game is superb. It has so much in it, so many choices and variance of how things will turn out. Based on a single play, I absolutely love this game and can't wait to play again. I can't give it a 10 based on a single play, but will revise my score after trying it a few times to see about replayability factor.

Oh, and I'm totally over the fact that I spend my time "just making dresses" :)

Interesting mix of role selection, deck building (however minimal), resources management and area majority. There are a few strategies to pursue but nothing mind boggling... it's a solid game but there is nothing hugely exciting, once players have picked a (primary) way to build end game VP the execution is (mostly) without surprise.

20-09-2014. Rated after 1 play with 5. Rococo is a eurogame that utilizes action-selection/hand management to force you to optimize your actions in order to be the best dress maker for a party and contribute to scenery and fireworks. 

The game basically is contains many familiar mechanisms, area-control (majority scores), set collection (for dresses and majorities) , action selection / hand management (you take actions by playing cards) and a little bit deck-building mainly (buying new cards). While this particular combination of mechanisms is novel I think, the game feels familiar.. Basically you try to utilize your actions as effective as possible to get as many majorities and sets for scoring. Fairly typical. 

Because the mechanisms are familiar recombinations of old mechanisms, the theme is what makes this game interesting for its audience I think. I do not care for dress making and converse didn't really care much for the game. I'd play it again, because the game is ok but nothing special.

RATING: 8.5
This is an enjoyable game but I think it is geared more for veteran gamers that new players. It is true to the theme, forcing players to gather the right materials to craft one of a kind dresses and coats for nobles to wear to a lavish ball. The components are great and the gameplay is challenging, forcing you to keep track of things like which employees can perform which actions. I guarantee you will make mistakes with this part when you first play the game. Also, the scoring at the end is a little complicated. Overall, a very solid game and one I look forward to playing again.

Who would have thought grown men playing a game about constructing dresses in 15th century France would have so much Fun. In Rococo you are constructing dresses or creating decorations for the Kings ball. Players use cards to collect resources and perform actions to construct dresses and to rent to aristocracy at the kings ball to gain Fame. The person with the most Fame wins. This game has a lot to think about and is not considered a light game.

Pros: important and deep decision making involving the timing of playing action cards. Gorgeous artwork components and production. Fun card play mechanic

Cons: Long play time for indecisive players. Overwhelming board with multiple options to score points. Unpopular theme.

--Jul2015-- Pleasant game of short-term optimizations.  There are some interesting choices - but the changing landscape makes it very difficult to plan ahead (or even consider one's move much before the immediate-preceding player is half done.)  I'd be content to play again, but I'll not request it.

RATING: 5
A game that has some great and some bad elements to it.

It's beautiful, the theme is new and fresh and surprisingly fun even if you are not really interested in dresses, fashion and the like. You can tell it's made with love to detail, which also makes it way more fun to play.

The mini in-game 'deck building' also adds a great new element to the game, while not being too overpowering at all. (Most people thus wouldn't even call it deck building)

My biggest problem with this game is that it's a classic 'victory point game'. Basically, the whole game you do stuf without knowing if it's the best choice (Should I make a new dress or sponsor some musician for the festival? Uhm - both somehow give victory points in the end, but it's not transparent at all what gives how many, so...) 

The problem with most victory point games is simply that, you don't do stuff because it gives you an understandable advantage, but because it gives you an intransparant amount of victory points in the end of the game. This just feels completely random, and while it probably can be really fun if you play with players that share exactly your level of knowledge of the game (preferably a rather high one), this game - again, like most victory point based games - is basically impossible to play with newer players because it's so intransparant what a good and a bad move/decision is.

tl;dr: A game with huge potential that is in my opinion destroyed by relying on intransparant victory points at the end of the game.

RATING: 8
I don't feel like Rococo really has an overly-familiar deck-building flavor, even though you are drafting/buying cards that are used to take actions. The cards are not randomly drawn from the deck, but instead are specifically chosen each round, so the game gives the players some good control. But the restraint to play all the cards before repeating others gives meaning to the choices. And the ability to thin the deck provides an option to really commit to certain strategies.

The scoring at the end is fairly complicated, and I thought I might not like it, but I actually do a lot. The board has a lot of area-majority scoring, plus there are cards that provide end-game scoring, and there is a cool strategy with fireworks to score dresses with extra multipliers.

Dresses though? We are making dresses? Yes, and it's really great.

Rococo is just what I need from a medium-weight Euro, but also what I deserve. Rococo makes medium-weight Euros great again. Ask not what you can do for medium-weight Euros; ask what Rococo does for you.

I really like several aspects of Rococo. The deck management (particularly in the early-mid game) is seamless, well integrated, and rewarding. There are a number of good options for scoring points, and the area majority is well implemented. I think it's better with more than 2. All of the cards are in, and if you don't contest the different areas, your opponent will get too many cheap points with 2. The late game cards are a little awkward, which is the biggest issue with the game. They give you alternative ways of scoring, but it's awkward to build a strategy around them because you can't guarantee that you'll get them unless you take the first player action first every round from fairly early on in the game.

I didn't think I would like this one, but it really has some elements that I like.  The deck management aspect is cool and there is no shortage of places to go for points.  Being able to sell made dresses for coins rather than keep them for points is also pretty neat.  I would really like if you didn't get to see ALL of the people for hire every game.  Variety in that way is something I really like.  It's a solid 7 and it may go up, but I also question replayability somewhat unless they put out a "more of the same" type of expansion.

After another play, I'm bumping this up to an 8.  The possible release of an expansion that may add additional cards and a little uncertainty would be awesome.

An interesting game, plays through 7 rounds so I do tend to wish it went on longer. It can be quite tactical. Players use apprentices, journeymen and masters to do various things, such as gather fabrics (apprentices), visit the queen for firstplayer status and 5 gold (journeymen and above), and make dresses (journeymen and masters) or hire new workers (masters only). Dresses that are made are then placed in the concert hall, gold thimble dresses which are made only by masters get placed in the best locations. Statues can be bought, which either add endgame points, or augment income based on the number of dresses made/statues built. All in all, a fun game, though there can be some luck involved based on which fabrics/thread/lace tiles come out, and on which dress patterns come out. Giving this game 8 stars, highly recommended for people who like strategy with a bit of luck.

Very pretty game which we play with 2 or 3 players. All about making dresses, and showing them off at the ball. Extra points are won by having the dresses worn at special locations during the ball, and by investing in various decorations or fireworks at the ball. We like the game a lot, and ordered the extra promo tiles from Eagle games - they helped a lot, because blue fabric is super rare, and the promo tiles help with that.

Rokoko is a worker placement game, and not the worst one. The dealbreaker for me is the game board, though, which is beyond baroque. Rokoko indeed (which, as far as I can remember from my arts classes, was the even more ornate successor of Baroque).

First of all there are the finished dresses in four colours, which are the same as the player colours, but not related to them. This alone already turns the board into a concentration exercise to get an overview. Does player red already have a green dress? Does yellow have a dress in each colour? How many male-female couples, i.e., combinations of (red or yellow) and (green or blue) does blue have?

Then there are the majorities in the ball rooms, where you mostly can go after the number of wooden disks, but must take care not to count the one of the musician. You [/i]do[i] have to count that one when taking points for each decoration, though, so between all those dresses and disks, you now have to find those that belong to musicians so you can count your points correctly.

Needless to say, it is also hard to find out which and how many spaces are still free, and the two ball rooms next to each other on the same level do not help.

Other than that, I think it's a quite good game, but I just can't see myself playing it without having a major headache afterwards.

Nagyon jókat hallottam a játékról, de nekem csalódást okozott. Szegény Friesét szidják, hogy a nyíltan bevallott Copycatje nem igazán jó. Nos a Rokoko nem nyíltan csinálta meg ugyanezt. Kb. 0 újdonság van a játékban. Ugyanaz a paklibővítés, mint a Dominionban, ugyanaz a TTA tolódási mechanizmus és rengeteg győzelmi pont gyűjtés. Azt éreztem játék közben, hogy minden csak a győzelmi pontokról szól. Már túl sok módon lehet őket szerezni. Ruhákat gyártunk szabóinkkal, de igazából bármi lehetett volna a téma.
A játék működik, de engem semmi nem késztet arra, hogy bármikor ehhez üljek le játszani, ne egy régi jó elődhöz. Friese Copycatja sokkal letisztultabb és számomra jobban működő játék.

I really like this game.  It combines several interesting mechanics (area control, work placement, and deck building) into a neat package.  It is a gorgeous game as well.  The game feels tight throughout, as there are limited actions.  Money, materials, actions, spaces on the board -- you always want to do more than you can.  There are multiple paths to victory and monitoring how your opponent is trying to achieve victory is as important as planning out your own actions.  The game is a little more strategic and deep than I expected given the theme.  I also appreciated that it is fairly easy to learn and teach.  I didn't have to refer to the rules much in my first play.  I recommend this if you are looking for an interesting Euro.

1 play, 4er

This is sort of a deck-building game, but not really. It's more area control, with card drafting and hand management. The rules are very simple, and the game plays smoothly and quickly ... may have to get this one!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
The board shows a palace, divided into several areas (full floors; 2 half-floors). Each area has places for dresses, some tagged with a gold thimble, and decorations. There's a row of dresses, and an area of materials (tiles with different colors of cloth). Also, some high-priced statues (which are for end-game scoring).

Players each start the game with identical decks of cards. Cards have a top half (gold, silver, or crappy thimble) and a bottom half (different actions, such as acquiring material, making a dress, hiring new employee = add card to your hand, buy a decoration, etc.). Each round, select any 3 cards from your draw deck. When the draw deck is empty, your discard pile becomes your draw deck -- previously played cards are available again! (This is just like the card play in Glass Road)

In order, players play single cards from their hand to their discard pile until all hands are empty. With each card play, they take the top action, then the bottom. Some actions, marked with gold thimbles, can only be taken by Masters; others by gold or silver; the rest by any. When making dresses, you can buy any on display (some require that you are playing a Master card); the ones further back in line cost more. Then, spend the required materials and either discard the dress for money or place the dress (and a control marker) in a legal space on the board. Some spaces give you an immediate reward (of material, money, etc.). One action, hiring new employee, adds a card to you HAND -- so you can play it this turn! 

When the round ends, reset the board: fill in missing materials and dresses, place 4 new employees (cards) on display. The game ends at the end of the round when all the cards have been put in display. The cards come up in a semi-fixed sequence: there are 6 groups, coming up in sequence but in random order. Cards in the final group score end-game VP.

At the end of the game, players score VP for:
- end-game VP cards (e.g., for pairs of male/female outfits, specific colors of dresses, etc.)
- every decoration with a VP value printed
- each statue you've built allows you to score create a set of dresses of different colors, scoring 2VP / dress
- each floor earns the players with the most and second-most dresses there VP
- the roof scores VP to the players with most and second-most control markers there
- dresses on the top floor are moved up to the roof (to watch fireworks), IF the dress owners have a matching control marker up there; each location there is a 2x or 3x multiplier for the dress value
- ALL dresses on the board score their VP value (those on the roof modified by their multiplier)
- leftover materials and money are worth a few VP
The player with the highest sum wins!

I was so surprised by how much I like this game.  It is a game about making dresses after all.  But it is incredible.

The game is a role selection game where each turn players pick 3 cards from a deck and choose which actions to take with them.  The cards are of different levels; master, journeyman, and apprentice and the lower levels can't take some actions the higher ones can.  Those actions include collecting materials, making dresses, hiring new employees and funding decorations at the ball (as well as a few others).  This is all in service of scoring victory points.

One of the players in my first game accused this of being just "victory point salad", a term coined recently to describe a lot of Feld-ian games where you do different things to get victory points almost in mini-game fashion.  There's nothing wrong, to me, with that style of game.  Feld is one of my top 3 favorite designers after-all and many of his games fall into that category.  However, I would argue strongly that this is not that style of game.

This game is very, very deep and rich in strategy.  All of your actions serve a reasonably singular purpose and while there are different scoring opportunities they aren't a disconnected "victory point salad".  Everything is so perfectly balanced between the actions different employees can take and also the secondary action of those cards (the apprentices tend to have more powerful secondary actions than the journeymen and masters).  The employees you hire and materials you buy meet a nice balance of being more expensive the earlier you get them.  There are also very varied paths to victory that are each extremely viable.  My first game the top 3 players in a 4-player game had scores of 60, 64, and 65 and they all had very different strategies.

I really do adore this game and think it has a long life span with the depth of strategy it presents.

RATING: N/A
A classic euro styled euro game with some area influence mechanics and a newish simpler deck building system.

The idea of having this kind of deck building would work better in my opinion if the game would be more friendly, or simpler to play as I think it lacks some more complication on the kind of actions players perform after rebuilding their decks for the time of play it takes. It turns out to be the same actions all over again, with different cards, but with the exact same feeling. And we never feel that this card is expendable completely or a really relevant choice to discard or keep a card.

And because cards and actions in principle remain the same, only special actions provided by the cards change a tiny bit, the feeling of playing 7 turns is a bit over the top.

Players get resources and 'build' dresses that they may sell or get influence into the palace or they sponsor some characters (musicians) and get straight VP. Nothing new in the core aspects of the game but a newish deck building mechanic that would have been great if more complicated for some players or better even, if lesser complicated for family or ocasional players.

A kitchen sink of mechanisms and Points scoring routes. Both  dull and brain aching at the same time, where the great theme is drowned out by the bog standard conversions and 'paths to victory'.

The action selection mechanism is interesting - what you do with it is not (buy goods, to convert I to dresses which to place in vp tracks, in summary). 0f the three similar action selection games at Essen 13 this is my least fave so far.

Players are dress vendors slash interior decorators in the court of Louis XIV. Each round, each player activates 3 action cards (minions) from their deck; when the deck is exhausted, previously-used cards are made available again. 

These minions can be used to purchase cloth, install decorations in the palace, hire new employees or make dresses. Dresses can be rented out to ladies to swan about the palace (victory points plus victory points for majority ownership in each hall) or sold for vast sums; decorations are extremely expensive so it may be necessary to sell off some frocks to afford them.

There's nothing really novel about the game, but it works very well. Competition is very tight and timing is important.

Hand/deck management easier, less interesting and less important than I had expected based on the elevator pitch; this is not a game for fans of novel mechanisms. Perhaps my biggest qualm is that the game gets less interesting as the board fills up: early rounds are open; as opportunities dwindle, late rounds stink of unpleasantly transparent VP maximization. While this isn't unusual in a eurogame, I found it particularly annoying in Rokoko's case. There isn't much of an arc to the game (it's not like Russian Railroads, for example, where the last round is a ridiculously high-scoring culmination of long-term plans), so it's basically just mopping up whichever scoring opportunities are left; and its particular flavour of point-salad -- X points here but maybe also Y for a majority, etc. -- lends itself well to analysis paralysis.

This game is pure Euro which is usually a turn off for me recently.  However, I do love the theme of this one which is what got me interested.

I really love the small card deck you start off with that grows but is always manageable.  Picking your workers each turn is so much better than the blind draw of a game like Dominion.  There's an engine here, but it's reigned in each turn.

We play 2-player and it works amazingly well.  I love the tightness which is natural from a Euro.

Since I enjoyed both [thing=103092][/thing] and [thing=113636][/thing] a teamup of the authors sounded like a good idea. The theme and kind of bland box cover didn't get my juices flowing though.
This game combines deck building with resource collection and area majority. All elements I enjoy. And they are put together quite well. There's plenty of interesting decisions to be made as to what cards to buy and which cards to use for what action. And which majorities to go for. The obvious strategy was to go for as many dresses all over the building, so I tried maximizing my score in other ways. Unfortunately the one player who went full on for that strategy won by quite a margin, which makes me wonder if any other strategies are viable. Something to try out again next time!
The game left a good first impression, but repeated plays are needed to clarify if it is as deep as I think it might be, or rather one dimensional where only one strategy is actually worth pursuing.

RATING: 4.5
Uninspired.  There's a of potential here that just kind fails to come together.

I like how it takes the trappings of deck building and removes the variance out of it. Your gumming up your deck and ruining your next round is entirely your fault, not because of the shuffle of the deck.

I like the theme in concept, but the gameplay lacks thematic integration. It's a dry, mechanical experience about area control and hand management. For the theme, Pret-A-Porter is far superior. For the mechanisms, I'd rather play Mombasa.

Deckbuilding where you choose cards, don`t draw. That changes very much, but you have this also in Lewis & Clark. All other things in Rokoko are like in a standard euro game (changing cubes into points). 

After Lewis & Clark Rokoko is "only" a good game.

This game is a masterpiece in my mind and one that, while I have only played it 8-9 times, I don't see myself tiring from in a looooong time. It is such a unique and gorgeously dressed game with such excellent mechanics that I find myself getting into the theme and the atmosphere of it every time.  

So, the theme. This game puts you in the shoes of an aspiring tailor (or seamstress) looking to gain notoriety for the exquisite dresses your shop can produce.  There is a massive party about to go down where the nobility will be there wearing the finest (aka YOUR) garb in the land.  You want the night to be perfect.  You buy decorations.  You sponsor the evenings fireworks.  You bring in some musicians.  Then, you supply your tuxedos, your ballroom gowns, your finest apparel to gain notoriety and fame as the best tailor in the country.  But, there's a whole behind the scenes operation going on here.  Do you hire talented tailors to work under you, or do you go for those expensive textiles that shine and shimmer?  

Man, this game is good.  It such a great balance of euro-style and deck-building mechanics wrapped up into an uncharacteristically beautiful combination of artwork.  It is a party, after all.  The only knock I would give this game is that due to the colors and hues chosen for the artwork, it can get easy to get lost on what's going on with the board unless you are paying close attention.  I call this out because several people have made strategic decisions they would not have otherwise made had they seen the board more clearly.  This drawback is minor.  This one of the best games I have ever played, and will bring it out every chance I get.

If Rococo has staying power, I may bump my rating up to an 8. Despite the bizarre theme, this is a nifty action-selection/semi-deck-building game in which players vie for majorities in areas representing the palace of Louis XV during a grand ball. My only real quibble is that I think the fourth, and especially the fifth players are at a pretty big disadvantage in a five-player game. Plays OK with four and is probably best with three.

RATING: 6
Really another surprise hit. The gameplay is just fantastic. I was expecting this to be a really light entry-level euro, but there are quite a few things to think about and I would consider this a solid medium-weight. The gameplay is pretty simple but there are multiple ways to get points and you have to balance a number of things.

Some people I play with had concerns about a few of the cards possibly being overpowered, mainly the ones that let you do an extra "make a dress" action while also giving you a discount. The argument is largely that a lot of the other cards that give bonus actions are really situational, but making dresses is ultimately the goal of the game and getting to do it more times and for cheaper is a pretty big advantage. Those cards do seem strong but I would have to play some more to see if they seem too strong.

Additionally, it also seems like just rushing out as many dresses as possible could be a good strategy. This gives you points directly, helps you get the "most dresses" bonuses, and helps you get the "one dress in each hall" bonus. If other players spend time on decorations or optimizing their deck, it seems like they will be behind the players who rush dresses because they just can't catch up in points.

Despite those possible issues, this is a good euro that doesn't really do anything new, but offers a nice mixture of mechanics that give players enough tough decisions.

Sold.

Rococo is a very good game. The thing that keeps Rococo from being a [i]great[/i] game, is variety. The only thing that adds variety is the order in which the cards appear, and even they are sorted by ranking power, so the variety there is limited. There are a lot of plusses about Rococo, but that one minus is a big one. Time will tell if this becomes a big enough reason to sell it away or keep it.

This was a huge hit with my group.  A neat deck-building/action selection mechanism wrapped into a points-salad game of area control and resource management.  In other words, a lot going on, and it all comes together for a great gaming experience.  If you turn your nose up at it because the theme is making fancy dresses, you are missing out.  What a weird reason to not play a good game, anyway.

:star: I love the idea to make the cost of buying a thing depend on how many things there are to choose from - it doesn't really make much thematic sense to me, but it works well and is a fresh thing I haven't seen elsewhere
:star: works with 5 players

:nostar: the sculpture scoring rules are a bit tricky to explain
:nostar: I don't like the point tokens - they're small and with sharp corners, and different denominations are hard to tell apart; making them different colors and/or sizes would've helped

As suspected after reading the nearly perfect rules, this worker placement game with a dose of area control and a dash of deckbuilding feels somewhat familiar but really hits on all cylinders.

Rokoko is a game about making dresses and throwing balls. It's a deck building game where you can pick three of your unplayed cards each round and play a card on your turn to take an action. Actions include buying materials for dresses, hiring new workers (who immediately go into your hand to be played this round), thinning your deck for money, taking start player, making a dress and building a statue (bonus points usually).

Cards come in three levels: Master, journeyman and apprentice. Some actions are restricted to more advanced dressmakers. Most of the cards have a secondary bonus ability. You gather resources and make a dress from the card row (either for money or victory points). Newer dresses are more expensive the oldest dresses are cheaper and will disappear if not made.

Making a dress lets you put it into one of several rooms, all of which have an area control fight for victory points going on. Whoever has the most dresses in a room score the area bonus for that room at game end. Some dresses can only be built by master dressmakers and some spots are restricted for master-made dresses (those spots break ties).

I really enjoyed this game and am already looking forward to my next play.

I like what it tries to do with the deck-building, but I don't think it's entirely successful, mostly because getting a card you want is so turn-order dependent. (And it doesn't help that it came out at the same time as Concordia and Lewis & Clark, which are doing quite similar things with deck-building.)

The rest of the game is pretty standard stuff.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Rococo might not set the world on fire in terms of originality, but it still offers a unique experience in terms of theme and the combination of deck-building like hand management and majority scoring within a resource management framework. Because the game is also quite streamlined, this combination works incredibly well. Furthermore, the theme binds all elements of the game together so well, that it is relatively simple to explain and get into, even though it is one step up from, for example, Stone Age in terms of complex decisions. Lastly, the artwork on the board is fantastic. Looking forward to my next play!
UPDATE: Even though the game is entertaining untill the end, it runs pretty long: about 2,5 hrs with 3 players. Won't likely play this with four or five players.

With 4, turn order is *ridiculously* important - 3 players is solidly recommended (and 5 sounds like madness).  Game is complex - there's a ton of mechanics present which are very difficult to keep in mind and value your decisions around.  They feel well thought out and balanced so they're not bad, just a bit out of synch.

I'd generally prefer a more streamlined or faster-playing experience, but overall an enjoyable game with tons of tough decisions and a good balance of tactical and strategic play.

This game may have a bit of a silly theme, but it's a really fun mix of different mechanisms.  I really enjoy the hand management and how you can build up a strategy through getting cards.  As with most Area Control games, the mechanisms are pretty light, but the decisions are heavy. 

Not as great at all player counts, 5 is too chaotic and stressful, and 2 is too open and lacks tension.  Also some strategies are too easy to pull off, like hiring a lot of workers.

Great, very solid game in general though.

RATING: 6
It certainly lives up to its name.  This is a Euro, and it's gorgeous and incredibly ornate both artistically and mechanically, but it's also one of the most ornamented, arguably over-complex ones I've ever seen.  Choosing who your dressmakers are is a deck-building minigame. Choosing what to do with your dressmakers is a worker-placement minigame. Collecting cloth is a market mini-game. Sewing dresses is a timing mini-game. Choosing how to score your dresses is a currency-selection minigame.  Placing your completed dresses is an area-majority minigame.  Buying decorations with your money is a score multiplier minigame.  The sheer scope of it all is rather breathtaking.  

It's a real credit to the developers that they've managed to get this to a playable game.  There's so many possible points of failure, and the game manages to get by every one of them.  The downside is that the game sacrifices simplicity and clarity for the onamentation, and the whole of the gameplay is rather turbid.  On balance, though, I'm willing to forgive it, as you really can't expect anything else from a game called Rococo.

Idea seems rather simple, but it takes rather long to play. Making clothes is not the most interesting thing in the world and the game has some not so intuitive things like playing the card where you need to declare the action verbally. It would be simpler to play the card in worker placement style to a specific area to tell the action. 

The game looks good, but the wooden parts are a bit disappointment. Decorative board means, that it is not so clear either. In the end, quite a dry game, where experience is useful: you know what kind of role cards there are coming. The game has the deck building in the side role.

Rococo is a well-designed game with a charming theme, good component quality, and lots of choices each turn. 

The problem for me was that it wasn't very tense in the early game (at least with two players), had limited player interaction in the first few turns, and I swiftly got bored of processing cloth/cotton into dresses.

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to a couple or larger group who want a gentle, relaxing eurogame. I was sad to put it on the trade list, but I found it too procedural for us.

Rococo is in many ways what you would expect to find if Stefan Feld made a deck builder. Lots of ways to score points, a bunch of almost mini-games that feature auctions, area control and initiative battles. You barely even notice the dress making theme, as the struggle to out race your opponents to the prime spots over comes all else.

This is the first of what I hope is a long string of post Dominion games, where the deck building is a feature, not the focus of a game.

End game scoring is kind of wonky, but it doesn't detract from the rest of the experience, so I give this one a couple of big thumbs up.

RATING: 8
Highly thematic Eurogame.
You have a small hand of workers from wich you have to choose few to make your actions each turn.
The master tailors will be more versatile and have access to more types of actions (i.e hire better workers make master dresses etc).
The apprentices can perform more actions but less types.
The regular is in between.

You'll have to buy materials place your dresses in the halls or sell them, hire and fire workers and so on.

Lot of choices for lot of strategies, nice balance and no dominant strategy.

A nice middle complexity eurogame with an original theme.

Colourful, thematic and engaging!  This fantastic mid weight game keeps you fully immersed during each player's turn.  There are tight timing decisions between building your deck, buying decorations, grabbing supplies, or renting/selling clothing.  The lack of much in-game scoring is a great twist, since there is an ongoing theme of "who is in the lead?" until the last turn.  Overall, it reminds me in "feel" to a cross between Mombassa and Grand Austria Hotel.  Highly recommended!

They did a good job implementing the theme in this Euro: it feels warm and charming. In some ways I compare Rococo to El Grande, because you're working with the same set of cards each game. Therefore, it's important to know which cards are in the game and when they're going to come out.

Gain notoriety by creating the finest fashions and decorations for the King's ball. Area majority scoring on each floor of the hall with interesting decoration bonuses. Has a different take on a limited deck building element that I enjoy that allows choosing any three worker cards from your remaining unplayed cards.  Hiring worker cards can be used in the same round is novel and opens up another layer of action options.  The market system discounts remaining tiles and workers cards adding a value element versus risk of losing it.  I love games like this where there are more paths and options than there are resources and rounds to accomplish them.  Great fun decisions choosing the start of the round three workers, guessing what other players will do, and coordinating how best to use the bonus actions.  Can't overlook the statues and attending the fireworks.

As a respected dressmaker I am able to attract the attention of the upper bourgeoisie with an eye for aristocracy, and I use that to my advantage.

I extend invitations to both men and women.  The rougher sex I entice with a promise of 'clothes make the man'.  Women admire my looks, so they accept my offer hoping that my hands will stray as I measure and fit them and flirt to distraction.

But the ending is always the same. I murder the hopefuls with sharpened scissors, preserve them using an exacting taxidermist process, drape them in my finest creations, and display them - appropriately posed - in gilded glass cases.

My museum of cadavers is located just south of the church, and it tickles me that my installations are within whispering distance of the clergy. It is opened once per year to ladies and gentlemen with finer tastes, and though they lament the lost years of my victims they also recognize our right to find pleasure in the murderance of others.  We are the chosen few, granted spiritual acuity, and it is our privilege.

I support my work by executing my simpleminded staff and selling their leavings for premium prices to the medical school. Such mercantile exchanges keep me in the lifestyle to which I have grown accustomed.

One day there will be a resurrection and the corpses will enact their revenge.  My dolls will break free and I will be torn to pieces.  But until then my lips are always turned up at the corners.  Never down.

Very good game of resource management, hand management, and victory point paths. The hand/deck building aspect can be ignored or you can try to manipulate your deck as you go along. That appears to me to be the decision that has the biggest effect on the individual player. All games I have played in were relatively close.

Very neat game about making dresses. Very nice cardsystem to take different actions. And it has area controle, so you have to think about what to make and where you want to place it on the board. Need to play it more often.

Will be traded for Goa

Deck-building with no luck of the draw! You choose the cards from your hand each turn and must draw it out entirely before getting to cycle them again. The unique theme (dress-making) is fun too.

I'm having so much fun playing this solo! I'd love to play with someone else because I think that would be even more fun

Pretty complex tailor-placing game. Combines worker placement with deckbuilding, tied together quite well by the theme. One of the few heavy games I really enjoy.

My wife really loves this game and I must say that the artwork is absolutely beautiful! It is a very nice area control game with some clever cardplaying. It is definitely on the light/medium weight side of things which is why it's not one of my personal favorites but I will definitely play at any time. It is slightly random with the dresses that come out and the silks that come out so if you don't like randomness you might want to think about not purchasing this one.

Lovely theme and components, but too little interaction and communication between the players. It seems that everybody is only working on his own dresses and best results. This works as you don't have to look too close into the other's players actions.

Who knew sewing dresses would be so much fun? This game has multiple ways to score VP so it is challenging and fun. Lace and thread!

This is just a pleasure to play. The game play is really smooth, turns are quick but I love the decisions to be made (especially with hand management) and all the mechanics just integrate together so well. The theme really comes through and is, surprisingly, a lot of fun.

Az első worker placement játékunk, nekünk bejött, de pár játék után eléggé átlátni a mechanizmust, monoton lehet a rutinosabb játékosoknak (de azért így is marad benne döntési lehetőség). Ettől függetlenül szeretjük, jó kikapcsolódás.

You play this game for 7 rounds but every round is the same. There is no real development or story arc, except for new cards that give you a bit money or discounts with their bonus action. Felt boring

Purchased after reading all the praise for it (touted as an underrated gem) and watching the full play-through by Heavy Cardboard.

[b]1st play, 3p[/b]:

Expected a brain-burner but things began to click mid-way through our session. Scoring is done at the end of the game (which takes a while to complete), making it difficult to see who's on top for the unexperienced. Combines a lot of mechanics (deck building, area control, drafting) that result in a wide variety of strategies and paths to go down.

Verdict: [b]7.75[/b]

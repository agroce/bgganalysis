2014-06-17: We played this so many times over a short period last year that I eventually got sick of it, but it's a good little game, and the components are top notch. Unfortunately I think if you want to win you HAVE to play nasty/attacking against other players, which is a mark against it for me. But I still like it.

2015-06-15: I really like this game, but the inherent mean-spirited, "take that" nature of this game irritates me and keeps this from rising to an 8. Why does the only interaction with other players have to be the negative kind?

Always different, always interesting... The Dummbot's Challenge solo variant is brilliant (Mage Level or higher), if you can't get this to the table with others often enough.

It's relatively fast with four, even, and offers many different strategies. The drafting segment of the game is very important. An excellent balance of working with what you have and some luck to supplement your strategy.

I bit complicated at first, but once you get rolling it is a great game, and can be fairly quick.  The expansions definitely make it more interesting after you've learned the cards from the base game.

Nothing stood out as especially good or bad. Played with two, seemed like it would be better with more.

This game let me realize that I don't like getting victory points directly; I prefer for players to be rewarded with victory points for doing the best job of whatever the game is about.

First time commentary: Fascinating mix of mechanisms: dice rolling, drafting, etc.  I'm 7'ish + my first time, figure it would grow with a few more plays (and card text familiarity) and have a feeling I'd never be 9+ excited about it, but may see this as a possible fun game to come back to over time.

RATING: 7.5
I think this is a game with a steep learning curve. Much of the strategy comes form the initial drafting phase, which is a very dry, calculating exercise. This means beginners have to pick things up fast to compete, or they will be left behind for the whole game. Future games should run smoother. It's certainly clever in the card interactions and a good drafting/set collection game. The artwork is beautiful but overly busy and limits functionality. The board is disappointingly small, but the chunky dice with nice clear iconography are great. A mixed bag, and I walked away from the game a little non-plussed, but it has been on my mind a lot since, and now I really want to play it again. Mechanically with all that drafting, it has obvious connections with 7 Wonders, but to me it felt a lot like At The Gates of Loyang too, with the tableau of cards building up in front of you, conversion of one resource into another, the changing market, and limited interaction. I love Loyang, but find the "magic crystals" theme far less enticing. Yes, I definitely want to play this again.

This was the game of GenCon 2012 for me. The beginner cards are great to get started, but the interactive cards really bring this game to life. Many cards are overly powerful and it plays a touch long with a full table of 4. Still, I love everything else about this game - the production values are great, the interactions are fun, and it plays so smoothly. Really great game!

Sólo una partida a 4. Me pareció muy muy caótico, azaroso, y descontrolado totalmente con cartas muy muy descompensadas. Era una fiesta de bajar o subir muchos puntos de golpe. Veo que es mejor a 2 jugadores o como mucho a 3. Habría que probarlo a ver, aunque el rollo que tiene muy muy solitario multijugador me tira también mucho para atrás, le iría muy bien tener interacción.

RATING: 7
Really torn on this one. Hate the swingy-ness of the cards, and the "illusion" of choice throughout the game. YET...any given time someone mentions it, I WOULD play it... Drafting is awesome, but that seems to be MOST of the choices you make in the entire game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I liked the drafting and the very interesting use of different kinds of dice. The system how you acquire resources and play the cards is quite fun as well.

Definitely not a 4-player game. The first couple of rounds are quite fast but once players have laid a few cards on the table and start using their powers, each turn will start to drag. With increasing player numbers the game also has more potential to spiral down into whirlpool of unfun. It is almost certain that the few cards absorbing and destroying victory points from other players will get played. After this the players not owning those cards have no incentive to make any VPs in the mid game since they will be lost anyway. Henceforth players will only wait for the very last round of the game and score the points they can. Of course this is a valid strategy but I find it rather dull if you have no meaningful decision to make for a major part of the game. 

Another bad design choice is that the card drafting is done completely at the very beginning. That means that you have basically locked down your whole game with very little room for reactive maneuvers. Of course you can draw more cards but usually you just try to play the initial ones as well to avoid the VP penalty from held cards at the end. I really would have liked a possibility to change direction and actually react to what other players are doing.

The rest of my criticism is directed at rather minor things such as the art and use of symbols. I love the art but for some reason it feel really out of place in this game. The game, the theme and the art just do not fit together although all three are good alone. For symbols, the VPs and the flames look a little bit too alike. But these are really minor complaints.

In a nutshell, the funniest part of the game takes place during the initial drafting. Creating combos and figuring out in which order to play the cards can be quite fun. But in order to minimise the duration of the more scripted part, I would really recommend playing with 2 or at maximum 3 players.

RATING: 7.5
Update January 2018: The lack of expansions means that you get accustomed with all the cards, which significantly reduces the fun element. I'd play it again, but i'm not eager to give it a try anytime soon. Dropped from 9 to 7.5.

I played it a couple of games on boardgamearena, which convinced me to get it. unboxed it yesterday and gosh those are some quality components. eveything fits perfectly in the box, and it is one of the most beautiful games i have ever seen. worth getting it even for the unboxing experience.

Seasons is a fine game, but it just leaves me feeling "meh" and it's hard to put my finger on why.  Part of the reason is probably that the theme is not very interesting to me, and the theme doesn't feel deeply integrated into the game.  On top of that, the decisions in the game aren't that interesting.  You rarely have more than three cards in hand, and the results on the dice usually aren't that different.  The game utilizes a variety of different mechanics, but doesn't really do anything interesting or unique with them.  If I wanted to do card drafting, I'd play 7 Wonders.  If I wanted to play with dice, I'd play Castles of Burgundy.  If I wanted to do resource management, I'd play Village, or Agricola, or Caylus, or any number of games that do it better.  Heck, if I wanted a game with cards, dice, and resources, I'd rather play Stone Age.

A lot of people really like this game, but I have a hard time seeing why.  It's not a bad game, but for me at least, it's just kind of dull.

A delightful game that I finally got to play - and play at the board game night I host at my local library, no less!  It was great fun, and will take a few more plays for me to fully understand what is going on - I was dead last.  But that's OK, I learned a lot about the game, and look forward to playing it again.

The art was beautifully done and the card effects were highly amusing.  I wish I could have played it longer, but as I also was teaching other people how to play games, my attention was unfortunately divided.  Perhaps next time.

Seasons is a mix of mini deckbuilding, dice rolling and card playing and very entertaining. It plays in a fair amount of time and offers some neat combinations, although the decisions are limited. In general they are broken down to choose the die and get the most out of your cards. To achieve this you need to draft the right cards and therefore have to have a certain tactic in your mind right from the very start.

Two plays with Kelly and I really think this one is a hit.  She got a bit upset that I won the second game, but I think we'll be able to get it back to the table.  She is pretty interested in draft mechanics, so I think she'll enjoy the "advanced" play a bit more.

There were a metric ton of things that could be done by cards, and it was hard to tie them all together and try to find a working strategy.  It didn't seem to require an engine to be competitive, just a couple good combos or a steady diet of high-point items/familiars.

Felt like a more complicated 7 Wonders, with a lot more engine-building and combo-ing.

Ended up trading this on, as it was just too many things going on for many people I play with and I struggled to get it played.  I still really like it, though =(

+ Orb of Ragfield, Crystal Titan and Speedwall the Escaped.

Such a clever and fun game! There're so many reasons for me to love Seasons. The graphics and the components are certainly something that draws you in: those dice look and feel awesome! I enjoy the mechanic of the the calendar, which introduces a strong time management aspect to Magic-style card games like this, as well as thr "dice drafting". Yet what I really like about the game is its "draft and play" nature. I loved drafting when I used to play Magic: The Gathering, but it was expensive. In this box I have the opportunity to draft as much as I want and explore so many cool combos and combinations.

Sure there's a relevant luck element. I don't mean the dice, because the luck there is easily balanced over time, but the cards. It's REALLY important to draw new cards during the game and, if you get lucky, you can really obtain a huge advantage over the others at the table. Still this is a game I'm very glad to have in my collection and one I'll gladly play every now and then. 

Rating without the expansions: 7.5

This game nicely combines dice rolling with deck building. The game revolves around a central board split into four parts, the four seasons. Each season has a special set of dice, which you roll and execute the rolled action: collect resources, collect bonus point and buy cards. The cards bought have victory point and also special  effects which you can activate by spending the apropiate resources. The game is fun and quick paced, the design is wonderful. Although the cards are not the diversified, there any many copies.

I've actually played this game twice already. There are lots of card interactions and the production qualities are great. I appreciate the theme, and the drafting in this game was fun without being overly complex. I could see the game potentially lag with AP prone players, but with people willing to take quick turns, the game seems like it has a lot play left in it.

Having played it 4 times, I think I'd actually rate this an 8. There are many cool combos, the production values are excellent, and it plays fast.

A fairly simple game of dice rolling for resources to summon cards out for VPs.

As the cards are initially drafted, the VPs is already half done and decided. The other half is how the game unfolds with the different die rolls to maximize the profit.

Random chaos that is both fun (to roll) and boring (activate) at the same time. Lots of reading to do for first 1-2 plays.

Easy gateway game for beginners to boardgames. Veterans will find this light. Even if they like it, it's for a certain group of gamers.

The first time I played [i]Seasons[/i] was back in September 2013. The rating then was a three.

Fast forward to November 15, 2015. I had forgotten I had played the game. The person teaching opens the game box, and I recognize it. 

I learn the game again. She does a fairly good job of explaining the game, decides to skip a part of it that only benefits experienced players, and the experience is better.

Not great, but better.

My rating went up to four, and while I still don't like the game, I may have been a smidgen too forceful with the original review. The real problem isn't the number of cards, but how you need to draft a deck on the fly at the very beginning of the game, with no guarantee that you'll get the tokens you need to execute your plan.

Essentially, your first few moves are playing blind.

So, as I said once, "I can see why some people would like it, although I've never understood why people find those games enjoyable."

что понравилось: красочное магическое оформление с долей иронии. суперские большие кубики из качественного пластика (куда лучше, чем в "Повелителе Токио"), комбы на картах. 

не понравилось: очень не хватает "поселеческой" системы такого расположения карт, чтобы не забывать о разных срабатывающих эффектах. иной раз забывали менять кубики при смене сезона. постоянно приходится пересчитывать лежащие на столе карты, чтобы свериться с доступным максимумом. в конце игры приходится несколько раз муторно подсчитывать, у кого сколько очков по картам, чтобы понять, выигрываешь ты или проигрываешь (и тебе необходимо срочно что-то предпринять, в т.ч. взять штраф). 

вообще, к рандому драфта здесь добавляется рандом на кубах, который делает игру больше похожей на King of Tokio, чем условно-серьёзную стратегию типа "Поселенцев". разумеется, это не обязательно плохо. 

по итогам второй партии могу сказать, что игра больше похожа даже на MtG, чем на "Поселенцев". за всю партию ты играешь обычно карт 15 (т.е. ни о каком прокручивании колоды речи не идёт), зато они зачастую довольно сильно меняют ход игры, в отличие от куда более скромных и спокойных эффектов "Сеттлеров".

I really liked this game when I first played it.  It was an interesting breath of fresh air, but some things didn't sit quite right.  Too much of the game is decided in the original draft, and it feels like picking dice tends to be pretty pointless / false choice / not particularly influential on the actual game.  Player interaction is low, and when it does happen it just feels bad for everyone.  It's an interesting game with some cool cards - and I'll play it occasionally if it comes down to it - but it really doesn't play all that well.

Dice drafting element is great, the seasonally adjusting point redemption for elements that come from seasonally adjust dice, fun, the engine builder however tends to overpower these other mechanics. Its a fine engine builder and the first two mechanics present nice solo player puzzles to solve, but all of the player interactions tend towards "take that" rather than the more eruo "find your own way/toy" .

A fantastic game for 2P - a bit long and chaotic for 4 players. The cards drive this game. The game is not very aggressive, but there is some interaction between the players.

RATING: 7
A unique dice-drafting mechanic gives each player a different combination of actions in every round, which they can use to gather energy, crystals, and artifact cards to become the top wizard in all the land.  Easy to learn and easy to teach.

Seasons is a good game, but with a better set of cards, it could be a great game. Each card provides the controller with some sort of special ability, and there are combinations of cards that nearly eliminate the need for energy (resources), or combinations that severely restrict other players' abilities to play cards or abilities, which severely restricts their ability to actually enjoy the game. There is also an issue where some cards pay off over time, while others have abilities that don't matter when you get them.  These problems would be fairly minor if the only cards you received were the ones that you chose in the draft at the beginning of the game, but there is also the possibility of gaining cards throughout the game, making it fairly common for one player to get hindered by drawing cards in the wrong order, or for a player to assemble a ridiculous combo without anyone being able to do anything about it.  It doesn't always happen, but when it does the game can be miserable.

The components in this game are amazing.  The art is good, though I'm not a fan of the anime-like aesthetic, the dice are chunky, the cardboard counters are thick, and the box insert has a place for everything, even after the cards are sleeved,

The draft that's done within the first ten minutes of Seasons goes a long way to determining the result of the game. To much too great an extent, the next 100 minutes feel like a drawn out way of finding out the results of that draft.  Yes, there is the element of collecting resources in order to get cards into play or to be converted into vps, but despite the seasonal theming to the dice and to conversion rates, that's not very interesting.

I found the artwork quite pleasant and production quality is good.  The rules are pretty clear.

Initial impressions, very disappointing. After hearing so much about it I expected a lot more out of it. The biggest place my enjoyment failed was that I really had no concept of the passage of seasons and their impact on the energy economy. In the end I was just collecting 4 colors using dice and turning them into cards. Speaking of the cards, I haven't had this much trouble keeping track of card effects outside of Sentinels of the Multiverse, but at least in that I am a superhero blowing up a T-Rex. In seasons, it is all too abstract to maintain my attention. I will probably toss it another play or two but very unimpressed thus far.

Can see why others like it, but not for me - despite being simple, drafty and combo driven (the best kind of game). Perversely, I suspect I would have liked it a lot more if it had been ~proudly themeless~

RATING: 6
Nice card game with dice. 4 set of dice one for each season. A player rolling the dice, the colour of dice is different for each season, takes energy tokens, play cards by using the energy tokes and finally activates the cards. 3 years and the game is over (12 rounds). 
I think its better with 2 persons than 3 or 4. Because has slow downtime when a player starts to activate his cards. A lot of combos you have to do with the cards.

Seasons is a good game. It gets the rating it does simply because the theme just isn't there. You are wizards trying to summon magic, creatures, etc and prove that you are the best. But I never feel like I am a wizard. I feel like I am rolling dice and using the faces of those dice for actions in the game. That aside it plays good  2-3 (have not tried 4 yet) without much downtime. each round you will get to do something. And while you may not get to do what you really want you aren't shut out of actions. Plus it has delightfully whimsical fantasy art and some of the biggest dice I have ever seen in a game.

Even if I could ignore the amazing artwork and how it paints this fascinating colorful fantasy setting (with a few naming conventions that hint at mythology), the game would still be superb based on its fun drafting, rolling mechanics and Power Cards (magic items, familiars) which you use to influence your scoring. Plus you have to like the simplistic alchemy mechanics, the Seasons themselves which affect all that, and the list goes on...great game and one of the better I own, simple to teach but a lot of depth when you break down all the cards.

What a fantastic game. The art is beautiful, the cards are synergistic, the theme works really well (it is cool to imagine the game actually taking place over three years, with powerful wizards tapping the world around them for week son end to procure energy, only to have a short winter so that the wind energy becomes hard to find!), and the game plays quickly once you know the rules and have become somewhat familiar with the cards. Expansions work really well, too.

If you are into strategy games and have a history with MTG, this is the game for you. If you don't want to sit down and learn what all the cards do and how the strategy works, STILL PLAY THIS GAME. If you despise reading cards and can't stand thinking multiple turns in advance, then maybe pass this game up, but everyone else should give it a fair shake.

There are some neat ideas - the drafting and long-term planning of the cards and the action die draft aren't bad at all. But I don't like what the cards do - some of the initial decks are just clearly better than others and there's no way to really "catch up", nor are there particularly interesting decisions to make during the game itself. I think I'll agree that given experience with the game, you could determine who will win the game after the card draft.

Pretty in the Fairytale style.  Nice graphics and large dice a practical size.  Mechanisms ran smoothly.  There are undobtedly card combinations if know the game.  First game we played recommended decks.  Unfortunately the theme was not familiar to me and did not engage me.  Apart from the knowledge of the cards dealt at the beginning, thegame was largely a reaction to the cards drawn and dice rolled.  I would happily play again, perhaps discovering thecards in the advance deck, but do not feel the need to purchase.

RATING: 6
Really wanted to love this one - the mechanisms (dice drafting, card drafting, hand management, deckbuilding, etc.) seem built for my personal preferences - and maybe if I were to play with the expansions everything would click, but for me, this game is just too fiddly (that score-tracker is just awful!) and limited.

Yes, there are 50 cards in the set [2 copies each make 100, which is another problem - 2 copies of each card in a 2 player game mean that you frequently have the same cards as your opponent], but only a limited set of those are used in a given game, which means (usually) there are no surprises, especially since you draft to assemble your starting hand. By the time you've played two or three times, you've basically seen what the cards have to offer, and it's not that wide-ranging.

The card portion feels like a half-hearted attempt at Magic or an LCG/CCG, but it falls far short because of the limited selection. The drafting portion doesn't compete well with a whole-hearted card-drafter like 7 Wonders, and just leaves you wishing they had executed better.

Disappointing, on the whole. Maybe the expansions improve the game (certainly they add in missing pieces - see the holes in the player aids), but the core game on its own was not good enough merit another round of financial investment.

Nem lenne ez rossz játék, csak van benne pár bosszantó hiba... Ami tetszik, az a draftolás az elején. Az alap taktika már ekkor eldől, hiszen előre meghatározzuk a későbbi lapjaink ütemezését. A sok kártya elég nagy varianciát biztosít, a nehezebb fokozatot nem is próbáltuk még. Az évszakváltások is jók, a játék hosszára hatással vagyunk a kockaválasztásnál. Az első bő fél órában nagyon tetszett: szép, ötletes, igényes játék. A bajok ott kezdődtek, amikor kezdett nyúlni, mint a rétes. Végül szabállyal együtt majdnem 3 órás volt (4 fős, igaz hármunknak az első parti volt), óriási holtidővel. A másik ami fura volt, hogy pillanatok alatt le tudtam tenni minden lapomat, új laphoz viszont csak szerencse révén juthatok, ha jut megfelelő kocka, így a játék felében nem nagyon tudtam mást csinálni, csak eladogatni az energiákat. A draftolás igazságos szerintem, de a később kihúzott lapok lutrivá teszik az egészet, simán fel lehet húzni 30 ingyen leépíthető pontot, ami a 100-200 körüli eredményekhez képest sok! A slusszpoén pedig, hogy az egyetlen olyan játékos nyert, aki végig csak kombózgatott magában, nem igazán törődve azzal, mit játszanak ki a többiek (akár ellene is), amivel nincs gond, de ha ez az általános, akkor megkérdőjeleződik a konfrontatív lapok értelme. És még egy dolog: a nagy matatásban, rengeteg kártya pakolgatásában simán elmozdulhatnak a jelölők, és utólag lehetetlen rekonstruálni, hogy mi hol állt...
Nem rossz ez a játék, de ha fele ilyen hosszú lenne, sokkal jobban élveztem volna.

RATING: 7
It looks great, and offers a very enjoyable 2-player experience.

- The drafting phase at the beginning is key to winning. This places players with less knowledge about the cards and combinations at a significant disadvantage.
- Some events (end of round, end of season) are easy to forget. It is managable at 2P, but can imagine this would be an issue at higher player counts.
- The scoring (crystal) track is a bit fiddly.

(Based on Initial Play) -- Too slow for what it is, at least with four players.

Our game had four plays of the "Adjust the season by up to 3 months" so we cut a literal year out of the game. And we had more 3 turns than 1, so we probably finished ~4 turns less than normal, and it still dragged. At least one player was pretty much out by the halfway point.

I can see the appeal, but I don't feel it. I may try it again with two or three, but not four.

A weird combination of a dice game and a tableau builder. You're kinda building an engine, at least in some of the games. Sometimes you just slap the other players around.

Seasons is a gorgeous piece of work. It has awesome french-style artwork, big chunky dice and a top-notch production (it has one of the most functional box inserts I ever saw!).

The game itself is very well designed: it has big power cards that trump rules, a drafting system to put these cards in the hands of the players, a clever speed-defining system built-in in the dice, and many other small details that reveal a long time spent play testing and polishing the game.

It has some cons: there's not much a player can do during his opponents' turns, so the downtime could be a problem when playing with four AP-prone players; and sometimes it can feel more tactical than strategic.

Anyway, the game is very good, and initial rating (7.5) could rise if it can stand repeated plays!

There are other drafting games that I'll play over this at its playtime. The card drafting can be fun in this game, but the remaining procedural fluff just makes this game hang around too long. To get the most out of the game, you'll need to learn the cards, as well, but the fun isn't there for me to stick around for that process. For the decisions you make, this would be better if it played in half the time.

Its a heavier euro / drafting card game than we usually play.  So far it seems like those who get behind tend to stay behind but I think its a factor of experience vs any inbalance in the game.

This borders on 6-8 for me. There are clearly a lot of interesting interactions going on, and the draft makes the 2-player game an interesting counter-war.

RATING: 8
Much of the fun of a TCG, but with a set card pool, dice rolls which heavily influence the tactics played and resource generation unlike many other games.

While it has dice, it uses them in the *ahem* correct way - you roll them at the start of each round, and everyone bases their choices on what turns up, not the other way round!

Really fun, quick and - if you can deal with the odd scoreboard - a satisfying game to play.

NB The draft at the start of the game determines a lot of the strategy, so it is advised to stick to some set hands at the start when introducing it to newbies.

I love Seasons. The die selection mechanic/CCG card play is just such a great combo. There are really some amazing combos that can be pulled of with the cards. Only issue I have with the game is that it can take a long time to play with 4, especially if 1 or more of the players is playing their 1st game. We had an almost 4 hour game at Dice Tower Con 2013 with 2 newbies to the game. Hoping the Path of Destiny expansion makes the game even better.

Everything about this game is amazing.  From the artwork, the dice roll/choices, the card drafting, the circular board game, and the amazing cards that can make, break, lengthen, or shorten the overall gameplay.  This is definitely my 2nd favoritest game (after Survive) of all time, and everyone that I have played with agrees with me.  I only wish, that some day, there will be an expansion or remake of the game that will allow up to 5-6 players so this game can get to the table more often.

One of my wife and I's go-to games. It has MTG-esque gameplay with a look and mechanisms that are more attractive for me. Players draft a hand of nine cards, then separate those nine into decks of three. One deck that the player can use immediately, and two more that will be "unlocked" during the different rounds of play. Lots of neat opportunities for strategy and cool card combos. Awesome strategic card game.

Tentative rating after first game (4 players).  Long and fiddly.  One of those games where finding the 'power combo' is necessary for success.  I simply don't enjoy that kind of game.  Agricola, Through The Ages, and Seasons all are acorns from the same game design tree.  A first time player is guaranteed a bad time by not knowing the distribution of the resources per season, not to mention which cards are optimal without ever having seen them.  Having said that, I'll try this again to see if it improves or if it really is pure, hardcore, and authentic anti-fun.

This game is a lot of fun. If it wasn't for board game arena I wouldn't get many plays of this. The problem is that people who do not play games like netrunner or magic have a difficult time working on card synergies and understanding the implications of the text on the cards. I love this game and I look forward to playing it more. I will only play with all the expansions. They add a lot of options and variability to the game.

Players take on the role of sorcerers of the kingdom competing in a three-year tournament to decide the new Archmage.  Draft 9 power cards, then collect energy and summon magic and familiar powers to accumulate amongst other things crystals needed to win the challenge and gain the title Archmage of the kingdom of Xidit.

This game has shelved all of Race for the Galaxy, Glory to Rome and Magic the Gathering. It's just that good.

I like drafting cards and dice. The fact that the game can flow faster of slower throught the years is a nice detail, too.
The artwork is fantastic, and the components are of great quality.

I haven't played the begginner game (pre-built decks), but the intermediate game (cards 1-30) is a fantastic game on its own, so the fact there are another 40 cards for the full game is icing on the cake.
In fact, the intermediate game is so good, I'm still up for playing it anytime, even after playing the full game. It makes for a simpler, more predictable game, so you can go into the game with some strategy in mind.


[b]2 Players:[/b] Meh. Not bad, but not great (A 6/10 game)
[b]3 Players:[/b] Great! Balances length and interaction. Maybe the best player count.

Fun card drafting game - building card combos. Some cards are simply overpowered (Kriss Dagger and Temporal Boots!). Some luck involved in dice roll, but skill still plays a big part. Very popular game on boardgamearena (helps in manual score counting).

- Critical to plan when which card to come into play 
- Important to anticipate opponent's strategy during card drafting
- Cards like Amulet of Water is good early game for quick growth

Gather energy of the four seasons in order to

Collect crystals that can be gained trough the summoning or the transmutation of seasons energy to win the game.

An interesting game with a nice mechanism to manage changing availability of resources. However, it is also one of those games with tons and tons of cards (with lots of tiny text on them). As most of the game involves playing and using the cards you are dealt at the start, your chances are largely dependent on the cards you get, which seems rather a disappointment in an otherwise well thought through game.

- Amazing artwork
- The decisions you make to trigger major combos is a ton of fun

- Can be slow with the wrong type of players (AP)
- There basically is no theme, so go in knowing this is basically an abstract game

This was sold to me as M:TG drafting turned into a game, and it did not disappoint. The drafting mechanic is important, but it's only one way to build a strategy. You need to balance card draw with card play, and there are no 'useless' cards. The dice in particular are really clever - they create a shifting economy that really drives the rhythms of the game... not unlike the Seasons they are intended to represent.

It's a little heavier than most people can get into, sadly, which means it doesn't hit the table often, and not frequently enough with the same group that I've ever seenthe in-box expansion cards.

I'd like to play it more, and would like to play it enough to need to buy the expansins!

RATING: 8.5
After several games in boardgamearena, I like this game a lot... I think this is going to be one of my few purchases for the 4th Season of 2012.

Light big box filler but meaty enough to be played with gamers. High replayability value. It's one of the most hyped games of 2012, but IMHO this game is way better and enjoyable than 7 Wonders (my last hyped buy).

*update*

Purchased! The more I play it the more I like it. 

It's true that, like in Dominion, some games are more exiting than others depending on the cards you get to play, but it's great how the game push you to look for the best way of making you power cards shine whatever the cards you have dealt.

I love Seasons and it's one of the few games which I don't mind spending my money on an expansion (of course, depending on what will come in this expansion).

This game feels like it could be played quicker than it does. It should be playable in an hour with three players, but somehow that has never happened. That's probably the biggest drawback for me though, because there's so much to like. Drafting cards for determining your strategy, making the best of what the dice throw your way, timing your card effects...

Depending on the cards that get drawn, there can be a reasonable amount of 'take that' in the game. But since you're drafting, there is a chance to mitigate. Not everyone likes this in their games though.

Also, the game looks great. It's the typical French comic book style in bright colors that appeals to me. There's heavy dice with custom symbols in different colors for each season and great artwork on the cards.

A tiny nagging issue is the small cubes on your player board. They shift the moment you merely scrape the board with your sleeve. It would have been so much better when there had been gaps or recesses for holding the track counters better.

The first part of the game involves drafting cards and putting them into sets for each turn.  It's pretty cool because you're trying to find combos and synergies and planning out what you'll be trying to do in the game.  The main part of the game is executing your plan and rolling some cool chunky dice, although I think most of the interesting decisions are in the card drafting and the main game can feel a little bit like auto pilot.  I also think it moves a little slow and can last a little too long for how light it is.

Played three times with 2, 4, and 3 players, drafting cards each game, and, despite winning the third game, each play saw my opinion of the game decline.  The randomness of the cards and of the dice and the way the game can get bogged down both hurt the game for me.  The third year is painfully long it seems like.  The other issue is how fiddley the game can be.  This includes the scoreboard, which is pretty poor, but more significantly, it includes a lot of the cards.  A card that takes a point from one player and gives it to another, that earns crystals when you play another card, or that gives you something when the season changes are all way too fiddley.  I just got sick of it.  I had the card where everyone had to give me a point each time the season changed.  I started to feel really annoying after a few season changes.  Plus, if you forget to do something, which happens a ton, you just can't go back and do it, or can you?  What if someone wants to and someone else doesn't?  The game could be so much cleaner.  I'd likely be willing to play the game if someone else really wanted to, but I wouldn't expect to enjoy it.  

All this being said, I would probably buy an iOS app of the game if it came out.  The app would get rid of much of what was frustrating to me.

interesting dice-drafting, engine-building card game. Much like 7 Wonders, it looks more complicated than it really is, but our first 4 player game took an abysmally long 2 1/2 hours, which is way too much for what this game offers. I suspect this will drastically reduce with experience, though I also fear (again, much like 7 Wonders), it will get old rather quickly. I'm willing to give this another try at the very least.

A hodgepodge of mechanics that come with a VERY thin theme.
Anything could have gone with this - but the fantasy theme is just to make it "cool". Disappointing game play that results from getting a die roll and drawing good cards (ie. you have to be lucky). 

I felt is if there was nothing I could do to stop the leader. Making points to catch up was painful.

Not my favourite. 
UPDATE: still really bad - takes too much time to achieve a goal that feels out of reach half the time.
Play 7 Wonders.

Interactive and in-your-face card game; brilliant stuff. My rating has only increased as I've played the game more. Absolutely fantastic. The agony of choice comes from both the card draft at the beginning of the game and the draft of dice at the beginning of every turn. The depth in strategy and exploration of combining cards is superb. The only downside of this is the barrier to entry it creates - I learned how to play the game with my missus, and have only played it with her. If either one of us were to play a new-comer it would be difficult not to destroy them at the game, given the steep learning curve.

A couple of broken cards in the base-game that essentially only adds more Take-That-elements, more pointless micro-management (there already is a lot of it) and extreme moments of luck. House Ruling these cards out is completely fine if not obligatory.

This is a game I bought primarily because of the hype and fancy dice. 

Like Keyflower I finally got around to playing this game on 2/19/2013 because I need to run it at a convention over the weekend.

My first thoughts after playing this game was, "Well I can't see what all the hype is about.". I game fell alittle flat for me and my group but then I started to really think about it... We didn't really play by the rules. I don't meen that we cheated. We just made some changes to make the game easier to explain. Rather then explaining the cards in depth before the first play I just delt out 9 cards to each player. Each player then made 3 stacks of 3 cards at random. One was their starting hand, one was their year 2 cards and the other was their year 3 cards. We completly ignored the draft and upon later revewing of the rules the pregenerated hands. I have a feeling this took alot of the early strategy out of the game for us.

Looking back I definatly want to take a few more wacks at this game before making a final descision. 

Update - 2/26/2013

Taught this at a local game convention over the weekend. My impression on the second play through is "Man this game can really drag on." 

I'd still like to play it once more before I make my final descision.

RATING: 8.5
Great tableau-builder with many interesting combos and choices. The drafting phase is by far the most important in the game: I love how you can plan out your entire game before you've played a single turn, and it feels really good when you can pull your long-term plans off in the final year. 

My biggest complaint is that it is almost too easy to cast spells: usually I find myself playing all three cards within one or two turns of the new year, and I just sit there for several turns hoping for a draw die, or otherwise just waiting for the year/game to end. Not a satisfying experience. More drawing spells would fix this, though I suppose after a few more plays I will get better at planning transmute actions for points while I wait around for the next year to come. Can't wait to try out the expansions, though!

RATING: 7
An interesting game of forming card c-c-c-c-c-combos in order to produce the most points possible!

The overall rules are very simple.  You'll draft some cards at the start of the game, getting some of them in each of the three phases of the game.

Then, in a round of play, some dice are rolled, and in turn order each player gets to pick one of the dice, which awards the player various stuff.  The most common stuff are elements, which you'll have to spend to put cards into play from your hand.  On your turn, you'll pick a die, and then play and activate as many cards as you'd like.

Cards do all sorts of stuff.  They can score you points, steal points from other players, get you more elements, allow you to draw more cards, etc.  The key is drafting and playing the cards in such a way as to maximize your score.  They're also key in giving you flexibility with which dice are good for you, as you definitely can't get on always getting exactly what you need from the dice.

Overall, just a unique combination of card and dice drafting.

+ A great and addictive game, perfect for 2 players! Every play seems different since you can always come out with new strategies.
The art is simply beautiful, one of the most beautiful games on the market. (In french, it is edited by Libellud which also edits Dixit.)

– It is well balanced, though some cards/strategies seems better. (The expansions correct that.)
Seasons becomes long when playing 3 or 4 players (count maybe 30 min. a player).

Very good game that scratches the "M:TG" itch for me. The artwork is great and it's fun to try to discover and use various combos between cards.

Accentuates the worst quality of drafting games - making you draft cards that affect you for the entire game from the very start.  Wouldn't be a problem if the game didn't take 90 minutes to play.

The dice/action system is kind of interesting, but other than that the whole thing is bland. Lacks drama or standout qualities.

Here is a game that took me exactly 4 turns to fall in love with. That was how long it took me to "get it" and once I did I was off and running. Later in the Con I called my friend and told him about it, as I was talking to him he said "K, I added it to my next order, bring $32 in to work on Monday. You'll get it in a week" Yeah, he could tell I was very happy with this game. I already want the expansion, even though I have barely scratched the surface of the base game. Like I said earlier, I like fun games, and this is fun. And a little nasty.

It's the energy tokens. They are a layer that, for me, feels excessive. The transmutation, the dice that faces that give you energy, the cards that give you an energy, I find them all dull. 

The fun part of the game is the cards (and, sure, the dice to acquire your energy to play the cards), the rest kind of gets in the way of that for me. Also, the cards just aren't all that exciting. Once you've seen the gonzo cards in Innovation or Glory to Rome, it's hard to get excited about ho hum cards that do something minor.

So, getting stuck with a die that gives you energy. Or playing a card that gives you energy. These are dull turns for me.

RATING: 8.5
Picked this up just based on ratings I've seen. Initially we played it with 4 players, and we found it really confusing. All the game mechanics are interlinked and one can't easily be explained without knowing how the others work. Terminology takes a bit of getting used to. With "Power Crystals" read "Points". After a couple of playthroughs (with 2 players) it all became clear.

This is quite an American style game in that one person can be in the lead from the start and the others don't really have any chance to overtake, which can be quite frustrating the losing player. There can also be quite a lot of luck involved. However I think this is the kind of game a person could get really good at by learning tactics and knowing good combos of cards.

A lot of the cards have on-going effects and the player needs a sharp focus to remember all the things the cards do on his or her turn.

Lovely themed game and nice artwork. Probably better with 3 or 4 players. Shame there is no option for 5 or 6 players.

RATING: 4
I like the idea of drafting cards and then setting cards aside for use in different rounds of the game. But the card effects are too chaotic and random for that type of forward planning to have any significance. I don't like the theme and it feels tacked on anyway. Too long for what it is as well.

Such a surprise game for me. I played it a couple times and thought of it as ok, but after repeated plays it's just awesome! This should only be played with 2, because it's not as chaotic. Each game is very different and requires different techniques to win. There are plenty of combos available with the card variety. It also plays very quick for a game of its weight.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Another one of those games with a unique dice-using element.  In this case, the gathering of resources depending on what is rolled, in conjunction with a drafting mechanism related to which die you may or may not get.

I also like the ability to manipulate the game timing dial to either accelerate or slow down the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I finally finished playing a full game of this.  Your first time will definitely take close to 3 hours.  I highly recommend using the beginner's setup in the instruction book, which bypasses the drafting phase.  You WILL get people who thoroughly read and consider every single card if you don't and it will take a LONG time.  

The game itself will probably take 1.5-2 hours, regardless of what the box says, after learning the game.  

Overall, the game is a ton of fun.  It's simple, but has a stacking technique you can take advantage of to win.  It's nicely balanced and great for people who like to create their own strategies and plan ahead.

RATING: 8
I had read reviews of Seasons, and basically thought to myself, "7 Wonders with dice?"  I wasn't very enthused, as it sounded like a mish mosh of drafting, dice rolling, card tableau, etc.

But actually playing the game, it plays much smoother than I expected. Turns go fast, and though the cards have text-based powers, nothing is too complicated. The artwork is fantastic... it's a great looking game.

I'd maybe try this with three, but probably not with four. So, a choice to pick this up largely depends on whether or not my wife likes it.

Update: Ultimately traded this away. I had played this a good bit with a coworker, but that coworker left, and now I have no audience for this game. It's a solid game though that I'd happily play given the chance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very swingy and fiddly game. You have to remember a lot about what your own cards do and there can be actions for you to take each time you play a card, transmute resources, each round, each season, etc. so it was more to remember than I cared.

The swinginess comes in from I spent 2 years with pretty much 0 points and then scored 100 in the last year so I felt like ultimately it was 1 round too long.

I've played it again with 2 and the game was very different and better. The game fit the timeframe and didn't drag, which was very nice to see. I'd be willing to play it again, but only ever with 2 as otherwise it does overstay its welcome.

[b]Thoughts? - [/b]A clever dice strategy and card drafting game that was becoming a regular at our game nights.  Unfortunately, like Dominion, some games are prone to some very negative tactics and the last play killed our love for it stone dead.  Hopefully with a bit of time it can earn a reprieve.

SO BEAUTIFUL.  Once you get past understanding the dice, it's really quite a simple game.  I have never seen a game that it felt like every card had such an accessible interesting interaction with another card.  Really feels like while drafting that you're making a true strategy to win.  I've got the expansions since last playing and can not wait to play with those cards, already I dream of the wonderful combos.  I Finally played with both expansions attached.  We were rushed and that really didn't help things, you need a bit of time to explore cards during drafting and find the combos within.

Graphics are cute and clear.  Although some cards are too overpower, it can be fixed for removing those cards for different type of players. Too many summoned cards effect has to memory and recall for each round.  I'm always feeling like I'm forgetting some bonus somewhere in the summoned cards.  It may make massive down time for beginners.

This is the best card game I've played. I like how it's designed to mitigate the randomness via drafting without having too many cards to draft. With only nine cards setting up your strategy for the rest of the game, every one you choose is really important - although, incidentally that makes the game very difficult to introduce to new players. Most will be crushed by more experienced players, even if the more experienced players have only played it once before. You're basically laying out the entire rest of your game in the first ten minutes of play - which it AWESOME once you've played it once. Fantastic game.

There is a lot to like about this game, but it plays way too long for what it is. My recommendation would be to skip 4 players entirely, play 3 players if you don't mind going longer than necessary, and stick with two players to hit the sweet spot.

I enjoyed this more the second playing. I think its a game that works better with the advanced/additional cards. I think it will become better and better as all players are familiar with the decks. But I'll never play it enough to experience it that way, due to interest in too many other games. 

So...its a decent enough game for the target audience. That's probably not me, though.

I initially thought that the attack cards that force sacrifices are annoying, but they affect everyone equally and aren't destructive to strategy since you always have the option to choose which artifact you destroy. However, the cards that allow you to build things for free are probably bordering on overpowered, especially when they're able to turn a +10 VP card to a +30 VP card. Also, having some more choce when choosing the Draw action on a die would be better, since you're essentially giving up getting energy/summoning power/crystals while doing so. Other than these minor nitpicks, this (temporal?) resource management game leads itself to more strategy than you'd imagine with the help of the Prelude. The changing values of the resources are an interesting take on the age-old question: more points now, or maybe more benefits maybe later maybe?

Players are wizards, fighting to win a prize (don't ask).

Introduced by a drafting phase, the cards are gorgeous.

Then players will take turn choosing a die to take action (earn ressources, play cards, gain victory points or convert them into ressources).

Most victory points win the game.

The game has interaction, and even some take-that elements, but not as much I as I thought. Any draft mistakes are worse in this game than similar games, like Agricola, 7 Wonders and Race for the Galaxy. In the others the draft is only a small part of what can be done. In Agricola you have action spaces and the fourteen cards, half of which you play. 7 Wonders has multiple card functions, either as the building, or money or part of the Wonder and draft many, many cards so s mistake isn't the end of things. The same is true in RftG in which the sear number of cards and the chance that you won't "see" the card even when it is in your deck. But in Seasons you draft nine cards, and may see perhaps four more? Plus players then separate the cards into three stacks, both Lanette and I misplaced one card in our third deck when we should have had it in our first. I like the die mechanic and the theme. I don't like the VP track and the little bits of VPs that constantly change hands, a pen and paper would do a better job, maybe some actual gem bits? Anyway I'll play again, but I don't need to own it.

Pięknie wydana gra karciana w ogromnym pudełku, proste zasady. Ciekawy mechanizm pór roku wymaga stosowania odpowiedniej taktyki przez graczy zależnie od warunków i wymagań dla danej pory roku. Gra wciągająca, niestety przy 2 osobach jest pewien niedosyt, bo rozgrywka w moim odczuciu wydaje się za krótka i poznajemy jedynie część kart, ale dzięki temu chcemy praktycznie natychmiast rozegrać kolejną partię. Ułożenie kart ma tu duże znaczenie, jak we wszystkich grach karcianych.

Like: 

Seasons as a timer, also how the length varies based on the number of pips on the unused die. 

Drafting Cards for the 3 years at the beginning of the game.

Crystals being used at a type of in game currency in game and points for final scoring.

The rarity of the elements based on the season and transmuting them them before they become common again for 3 (+) crystals.

The player board - Tracks info, as well as the actions you can take -5, -12, -20. Definitely worth doing based on the situation. 

Complaints:

In our game, additional cards were very hard to come by as they weren't appearing on the dice.

On the surface this might seem like a typical drafting or deck-builder, but Seasons is different.  Each player starts with 9 cards (there are a few ways to do that), and then split them across three years at the start.  After that, you work with the cards you have and hope to potentially get more.

Players try to play these cards by leveraging elements they collect each season.  Dice are rolled, and each player gets to pick one and reap those benefits.  Dice might give away elements, crystals (VPs), or cards.  Another option will be to "transmute" elements that are hard to find that season to get extra crystals.

This was so easy to pick up, we both definitely liked it, and I look forward to trying it again soon! Love the components (except that small score track), love the art (lots of great cards to enjoy), and love the concept. This is a game we picked up because it seemed unlike anything else we have, and we were right. Just unique enough to be a new winner for 2012, and certainly ripe for expansions.

RATING: 6
After more than 75 online plays of Seasons (on Board Game Arena) I'm saying goodbye to the game for good. I gave it more than enough time to grow on me. But it didn't.

Even with the software doing much of the fiddly work (calculating and tracking the points, exchanging energy, and enforcing the MANY card interactions), at the end of a game I always felt like I had just finished an accounting test. That's not how I want to feel when I finish a game.

While it's fun to pull off a great combo, there's too much time spent waiting for your opponent to figure out how they'll maximize their play. And there were games when I felt stuck waiting for the game to just end. In fact, there are cards and tactics that let you deny your opponent playing cards. Blocking the effect of a card is one thing, but keeping them from playing cards in the first place...how is that fun?

The game seems to be at it's best as a 2-player game. But ultimately, the design of a few of the card abilities and the restricted summoning slots is what killed it for me. To have control of the game you have to spend too much effort memorizing which cards your opponent has in their hand. You have to spend an equal amount of energy checking the interactions between your cards, your opponent's cards, and the season dial. I can only imagine what it would be like without the software, but I'll never inflict that on myself.

Instead of playing Seasons, I'll reach for Star Realms when I want to play a two-player game with fun card combos. It packs more fun into a shorter game and it doesn't suffer from imbalanced card mechanics.

RATING: 7
It's interesting to explore, and I like the feel of the game more than, say, 7 Wonders - partly because there's a little more going on, and partly because 7 Wonders starts off feeling very open but slowly closes down (and has those "well, gotta draft resources instead of something cool" turns), while Seasons starts off feeling very constrained (only 3 cards/year) but tends towards exploding.

I feel like the drafting portion might be intensely strategic once you'd played enough (and could thus weigh-in-foresight the combos and costs and practical-difficulties while choosing what to keep and what to pass), but until that it's more like "Smorgasbord of toys".

I'm curious how much the luck of the dice is/isn't swingy for experienced players.

Components: Wonderfully chunky dice. Gorgeous, mesmerizing artwork on the cards. The cards lack a linen finish, and so are a bit dull and difficult to deal out. The season track is a bit wonky, in that the price of crystals at each of the three levels obscures the other information. The score track is a pain, because it has an inconsistent number of points per row. The theme (aside from the artwork) is silly: “You are wizards playing a game; this is that game.” A game about a game?

Experience: Uneven, both in terms of luck, and how much fun I have each turn. The dice introduce a random element that can be very damning to the player who doesn't pick first. If only one star or card are rolled, the first person to pick has a large advantage. The game is too short and the die rolls too erratically in demand for the odds to even out over the course of the game.

On my turn, it's great fun when I'm getting resources I need, and I can play one or more cool cards from my hand. Playing cards is almost always fun. But this seems to be overloaded in winter, when I typically have enough resources left over from the previous year to play every card in my hand. Then I just sit around for the other three seasons, gathering resources (sometimes just wasting them if I'm full), hoping to get an extra card, but mostly just waiting for winter to give me more cards. Thematically, it doesn't make sense that all the activity happens in winter, and we're just sitting around the rest of the time. And in terms of fun, it means that the game is fun only 25% of my turns.

The cards fall along a wide spectrum of extremely useful recurring powers (a player will be at a huge disadvantage if they don't obtain a discount-giving card), fun one-time powers, uber-powerful one-time powers, and super nasty cards. I'd advise players to familiarize themselves with the deck so they can prepare themselves emotionally for what the opponent might throw at them, or how quickly the point totals might swing.

Overall, the game is fun, but very luck dependent and sometimes unsatisfying.

Just finished my first learning game -- played with pre-set hands, no draft, and only the basic cards. I loved this game -- some really elegant and fun combo effects, high perceived replayability, Agricola-like hand of cards you plan out over time, and 7Wonders-like drafting of cards ahead of time -- but also fun dice rolls every round where you draft the die that will give you resources/actions to take. Also, a Seasons game-wheel that plots the passage of time. Initial rating: 9.

Great drafting game with a very aesthetically pleasing art style. Some criticize that the game is essentially decided during the draft, and to a point I agree with this, but there are enough variables throughout the course of gameplay where I would say that this isn't a universal truth. I'd definitely recommend picking up an expansion or two as the card pool in the base game feels somewhat limited thus leading to the game becoming a bit stale after repeated plays.

RATING: 9
Always in the discussion for our Top 5 games of all time, Seasons combines card drafting, dice drafting, and tableau building in one beautiful package.  The base set cards are simple yet versatile.  You have to build a strategy with your initial 3x3 cards, but you also have to adapt to new cards that come up throughout the game.  Plus, some well-timed tempo cards can really change up your game plan.

As someone who plays a lot of Magic the Gathering, this is the board game for me. It's also surprisingly easy for a newbie to understand for a drafting game. I love creating card combos, and rolling chunky dice, and I love how you have to plan your turns ahead of time with initial draft. It can be an unforgiving game, which I find very fun. Even the take that elements (of which there are not that many) are fun.

Pros: Great components. Huge dice, colorful art. Drafting dice is a unique mechanism. Rewards repeated plays.

Cons: Difficult to teach new players in a fair game unless setup cards are pulled out as suggested. Drafting very swingy cards can determine huge advantages to players before the main game even starts. The card drafting is a large portion of the game. The drafting of dice and actions you take with them and of the cards you play seem pretty strategically straightforward. The tactics aren't as strong here.

RATING: 6
Seasons has great artwork, chunky dice, and card drafting (one of my favorite mechanisms). I really enjoyed this game with my first few plays while I was learning the cards and combos. In fact I would say this game is fantastic during the first 10 or so plays.

What I've found is that there's not near as much engine building as I had hoped and the deck can get pretty diluted especially with expansions. But my main beef is the BOOKKEEPING!!! You will feel like an accountant after playing a game of Seasons. Between dealing with all the card interactions, managing your summoning gauge, managing your energy, keeping up with all the point tracking on that terrible terrible scoreboard you will feel like you're working instead of playing a game sometimes. 

I really think this game is much better suited in an app form.

Also, the game can get pretty mean which will turn off some people considering there's not much interaction in the game except for those few "mean" cards. Those "mean" cards feel really really bad too. It can feel frustrating at times.

Despite all this I think there's a good game here with unique and interesting mechanics but I'm finding it hard to bring to the table when games like 51st State and Race for the Galaxy exist.

I enjoy this game, especially if we're playing it with fewer players and card drafting (instead of the pre-made decks which aren't very well balanced).  After an unfortunate 2-hour long gameplay experience with my mother-in-law who couldn't stay focused on the game, this game's rating took a small hit.

We just purchased the expansion and will probably have it hit the table the next time we get together with Jason and Shayla.

But, a basic store elements, trade those in to use cards or score points. Very much a luck based game, which I'm not a huge fan of either

RATING: 7
I have only ever seemed to play with game with new players.  As such, I have only use the predetermined starter cards delineated in the rules, and I have never played with drafting, or any of the advanced cards.  despite these facts, I really like this game, and I can only imagine that my score will increase when I finally get the opportunity to play the game as intended.

I enjoy figuring out little (or big) combos with the cards I have.  I enjoy the dice and how they are drafted, mitigating the luck somewhat.  I like how your turn is fairly loosely structured.  Some timing/interpretation issues have popped up from time to time, but these are usually resolved by looking in the rules, as they clarify each and every card.

I like this game so much I built my own custom insert out of foamcore.  The original insert is pretty awesome, but after the second expansion, there simply wasn't enough room for all the cards.  I also decided to sleeve this game, even though I'm not a big sleever, as the cards were starting to show a little wear.  Since I've only been using the basic cards to play, I didn't want them to wear unevenly.

[2013-05-29 Rating: n.a. -> 7.5]

Ever since discovering Collectible Card Games (CCGs) some time ago, I'm in love with the concept of card combos. It's immensely satisfying to build a deck with some combo in mind and pull it off later. But in order to get there, you need to invest time into learning the card pool of the CCG of your choice and, perhaps more important, you need to find opponents who also want to invest time into the game. This proves to become harder and harder for me these days. So when I read Seasons' description, I thought I had found a game which could be played in a more casual way and that could still scratch that card combo itch. Since there are only 50 different cards, the card pool isn't that big and you only get dealt a fraction of it at the start of the game in the drafting phase when you're setting up your strategy. 

Until now, my plan has worked and I've found an enjoyable card combo game that isn't that hard to understand. Some additional thoughts (all based on 2 player games):

* Seasons is more of a victory point/tableau builder than a fighting card game a la Warhammer Invasion. So in year 3, there might be some AP when you're trying to max your victory points.

* Depending on the set of cards that is dealt at the beginning of the game, Seasons might play better or worse. Like in Dominion, you might just get that boring set up or the cards that you're dealt are just perfect for a fun round.

* I find the victory point adjusting every round a little fiddly. I often tend to forget that ongoing effect that gives me x victory points.

Fun game of maximizing dice and cards to create combos. Nice blend of short-term maximization and long-term strategy. Remembering all the ongoing card effects can take a bit. There's also some downtime issues with more than two players. Despite these misgivings, a clever game.

RATING: 7
Benefits heavily from repeated plays.   You start to get to know the cards after the 2nd game, and it starts to click.   The game is won and lost in the combos you find, so you need to plan, think and re-think the cards you have access to.  2-3 players only.  Downtime can be an issue.

Need to play again to really know if my problems are with the game or with the basic game set up.  Basically, if you play the whole game with no way to get more energy than through the dice, you are sunk.  But I really like the art, and I think the idea is fine, so I'm keen to give it another go to see.

An excellent game! Love the big heavy dice, the artwork on the cards is cool, and the basic mechanics of the game are quite simple.  A huge plus is that they printed the FAQ's/explanations for every single card in the rulebook, which eliminates any ambiguities.  That's quality.  I also like that it scales very well between 2-4 players.

I very good implementation of a CCG style board game.  It has a steep learning curve because of all the cards you have to draft from at the beginning of the first game.  So don't even try it unless you plan to play the game 5+ times.  Besides having to see 9 cards per player at the beginning of the first game, learning the rest of the mechanics is pretty easy (especially for any veteran CCG player).

Waaaaay too long for what it is. I would've rated it an 8 one year in. I would've rated it a 6 two years in. It's a 4 as is. This is a highly random game where players do have opportunities to control the randomness, but little opportunity to reign in the leader. Lots of downtime in between turns, and you really don't have to watch what others are doing. I can see this being passable at 2 players.

Setting up for this game and listening to the explanation, I thought I would really like this game.  It seemed to have many things I like about Magic: The Gathering.   However, after playing a couple of rounds I started getting a hollow feeling about it.  It lacked a lot of interesting decisions.  There were instances where you played your cards out and just had to wait around for the year to end to get more.  Only 1 in 6 die faces allows you to draw.  So it can fizzle out and get boring.

It just seemed to me not to have anywhere near the depth as Magic.  Granted we played beginner with only cards 1-30 in play and pre-arranged decks (no drafting).  But given what I've seen thus far, I can't see it going up much higher with more complex cards + drafting.  It's just too shallow.  Your best hope is to have fun with some combo...but it's not enough.

Tastes like artificial sweetner.  I guess I may be spoiled by my many years of playing Magic.

Players are wizards duelling through the seasons over three years.  Attractive, and simple game.  Players roll a bunch of chunky dice, the colours matching the current season, then proceed to draft one of them that will dictate their actions for the round.  Typically, you will gain energy in four colours, used to summon cards from your hand, to get a victory point engine going.  Works well, and the different energy types cleverly go through varying stages of value.  All in all, quite good with two, but rather stodgy with four.  Surprised at how light it was.... not a lot of thinking required.  Lots of bits of other games bolted in to create this one.  At the moment, the jury is out.

I initially based my rating on finaly finding a game tray that takes into account sleaved cards. I said to the wifey that this gets a nine rating even before the first play just based on that fact alone. The game play and parts maintain the high rating for me though. I love the big dice, and I get to decide which die I want to keep. that mechanic is a big plus in my book. there is a small amount of 'take that' card play, I like when player interaction involves chananigan/thugary options on my turn. I don't forsee this leaving my collection. this is a solid pick that deserves shelf space!!

RATING: 6.5
Beautiful game. Nothing wrong with the gameplay, but a big part of the strategy required learning the cards. I just don't get to play often enough to do that. However, if I ever design a game, I need to reference this rulebook to as a go-by for how it should be done. Bravo.

Overall the odd blend of mechanics works well. There does seem to be a problem with some cards being too powerful but that is to be seen since I have only played once and there might be stratgies to counter this. 

From the one play there is something that can be taken from it that I would not be expected to change. Namely the tempo of the game slows as you play because you have more and more card effects to track as you build up your tableau. This causes the end game to drag as you must wait longer and longer each round between turns.

Why is this game so good. The draft is perfect, the components and art are GORGEOUS in capital letters (why can't we get more games in this artstyle), and it's got so much depth to it in a very non-intimidating package. I love it. One of my most played games.

THE DEAL BREAKER:
* Not as much variety as you would think given the big stack of cards
* I'd rather play Roll Through The Ages

This is a gorgeously produced title with solid, fun gameplay.  The giant dice are especially nice.  

However, despite all the chrome and cards, the game isn't as exciting as I'd expected.  You can often play all your cards, then sit around with not much to do until the next year begins.  In the end, it is not quite good enough to earn a permanent place on the shelf.

Good for 2-3 players.  Not good with 4.   Crystal tracking becomes tedious and there are a lot of +1 or -1, or X goes up while Y goes down, etc.   Although the draft is probably more interesting with 4, unfortunately.   Good art and a nice production give the game a lift.    Overall, the game has a bit of Magic and a bit of 7 Wonders, but falls a little short of what that combination seems like it should be on paper.   Currently, the darling of the Euro glitterati, but I predict that may pass because of the luck of the draw (during the game) and the somewhat attack-oriented creatures.  Has gotten more fun with more plays.  Added actual plastic crystals to my copy...  enough of that dumb curvy tracker!

2-en próbáltuk ki, s már most látszik, hogy többen jobb lehet, mert jópár kártya úgy nyer értelmet. Viszont többen pedig megnő a holtidő, hiszen egy játékos a saját körében végrehajtja az összes akcióját, ami lehet a kiválasztott kockán lévő egy vagy több akció végrehajtása, kártya kijátszása/aktivizálása, bónusz akció(k) végrehajtása. A sok gondolkodást a különböző kártyalapokban rejlő kombinációs lehetőségek maximális kihasználása adja, illetve hogyan szerezzük meg a kijátszásukhoz/aktivizálásukhoz szükséges energiaforrásokat. A játék egy "draftolási" mechanizmussal kezdődik (lásd 7 csoda), mely során kiválasztjuk a kezdő 9 lapos készletünket, ehhez nem baj, ha már ismerjük a lapok képességeit. A készítők ezért ügyesen azt találták ki, hogy ez a fázis kikerülhető előre összeállítható kis paklikkal, amik közül választunk egyet. Így egy fajta fokozatosságot biztosítva a játék megismeréséhez elkerülendő azt a fajta tanácstalanságot, amit mi leműveltünk :), mondván mit nekünk a kezdő fokozat, egyből a legnehezebbel kezdtünk, ahol az összes kártyalap játszik. Úgy választottuk ki a kezdő 9 lapot, hogy csak sejtettük, melyik mire jó. Persze menet közben kiderült, hogyan kellett volna összeállítani :). Nem baj, legközelebb jobban fog menni. Nagyon tetszett az, hogy az idő múlását a ki nem választott kockán lévő pöttyök határozzák meg. A szabályok elég könnyen érthetőek, csak a kombinációs lehetőségek felmérése okozhat egy kis problémát, egyébként alkalmas családi játéknak is. Nekem nagyon tetszett, kíváncsi vagyok, hogy ennyi (2x50) kártyalappal milyen kombinációs lehetőségeket lehet kihozni. (2015.06.10.)
Most épp lelkesedem a játékért. Épp olyan hosszúságú, ami alkalmassá teszi egy családi játéknak.Az újrajátszhatóságot a sokféle lap biztosítja. Két játékosnál a narancssárga lapok hatása nem annyira érvényesül, a lila lapok ilyenkor értékesebbek. A kulcs, hogy már a legelején jól állítsuk össze a 9 lapunkat. Jó érzés, ha egy-egy előre eltervezett kombináció bejön és sok győzelmi pontot szerzünk vele. Kíváncsi leszek, hogy több játékos esetén az egymásnak keresztbe tevés mennyire lesz befolyásoló tényező az előre tervezésnél. (2015.06.16.)

I haven't played Seasons in quite a while. It's hard to break out, as it best suits a two player environment but there are plenty of other two player games I would want to see before this one.

That said, the design of Seasons is unique enough to earn it some attention. Simple drafting for limited cards, but then trying to use those resources to your greatest benefit. Definitely worth trying out if you find someone to play it with.

Seasons is my favorite Hearthstone-ish board game. That said technically it is a tableau builder & not a two player head to head card battler. Cant talk about it without mentioning how awesome the huge dice are. There is a drafting and deck building component to the first half of the game. Then resource management becomes key to allow your deck to pull off the combos you built. I thought I was ok until I played this in BGA, Im not very good. I dont get to play this nearly as much as I want to. Should try to play online more.

Tableau building, dice drafting, card drafting game of energy converter placed in a beautiful magical kingdom of Xidit. Dice are huge and chunky, it can't be not fun to hold them. Card art is fantastic. Replay value is huge, even with the base game because the strategy wildly depends of what cards players selected for year 1, 2 and 3. It is evident that crystals were supposed to be token resources but are instead realized as a point track for practical reasons. Fun game.

Draft cards, throw dice, play cards for points. Strategy is timing and multipliers. The game presents a lot of decisions but they are rather shallow. Everyone will earn many points someone will win, probably off a key card play in the late game. I'm not convinced there is much going on in this game, it just has lots of clutter to put up a pretense of strategy. Thematically its ok, but creating a game about 'magic' is hardly constraining. Its a very 'nice' game, and that's why its popular. No one is going to get upset playing this.

Jól összerakott, durván nyelvfüggő játék. Szerencsére  ugye magyar kiadás. 
3 év, benne 4 évszak, évszaktól függő 5-5- kocka, amikkel dobunk, és egyesével választunk, a megmaradt kocka viszi előre az "időt", azaz haladunk az évben, a kiválasztottal pedig mi akciózunk, mikor sok kerül ránk. A kockákon energiajelek, eladási opció, kristály és megidézési csillag . Az energiajelek a megidézésekhez kellenek, illetve a már megidézettek aktiválásához, az eladással lehet "pénzre" azaz kristályra váltani az energiakorongjainkat, a megidézési csillag növeli a megidézési képességünk. 
Alapban ez 0. Így amíg nem szerzünk csillagot, nem tudunk leidézni lapot, ami pedig nem árt, mert van 3x3 lapunk, amit az elején megkapunk és szétosztunk a 3 évünkre. Minden évben az odatervezett lapokat megkapjuk az év elején a még a kezünkbe lévőkhöz. Ha a játék végén kezünkben marad lap: mínusz pont. tehát le kell idézni őket. Na meg az arra is jó, h mindenfélékhez jutunk, egyszeri dolgokhoz, aktiválható dolgokhoz, és folyamatosan jelenlévő dolgokhoz is. 
Az évszakok kockáink ugyanazok a jelek, de más más gyakorisággal. pl Télen nincs fa. Víz és tűz meg gyakori
Összességében nagyon tetszett, könnyedebb játék, jól összerakva, jól használja a kockákat, a kártyákkal nagyon jó kombók hozhatóak létre, gyors és izgalmas.

2017-09-04 : First play. Elegant and streamlined engine builder with a wizards theme. We played with the pre-constructed decks out of the rulebook and I was surprised by the heavy impact of certain take-that cards which seemed out of whack with the rather good think required to combo your cards well. It's not much fun if one player does some very clever play which nets him just 15 points while another player just randomly draws a card that gives him 30 points instantly. And this is not sour grapes - I was the one who, in one turn, played both 30 point cards for no cost and took 96 points from all the other players combined in the course of the game, winning by a mile, but not through superior play.

This was a review I wrote after a single play.  I have continued to play this and enjoy it.  I'll do an update on what I think about the components after I own the physical copy of the game.

Edit:  Components...
-Like the big dice
-Dislike the card backs but I guess it's better than some
-Score track sucks (I use poker chips)
-Awesome insert (fits my sleeved cards just fine)
-Insert fits all of the first and second expansions with sleeved cards too!

This game has largely replaced Race for the Galaxy and Gosu as my top 2-player game of choice.

Buy it!

--- 

Comments I made elsewhere which I'll copy/paste:

Beautiful to behold and a wonderful game experience** as well. 

What do I love about it?

-Some of the most wonderful fantasy artwork I've seen in years.

-A card drafting game with an actual game attached (7 Wonders and Fairy Tale just didn't work for me). Some would argue the draft is the game but I disagree as people will often draw into multiple cards other than what they've drafted. Tempo is important. Forward thought of what year to draw your cards matter.

-Other than the scoreboard this game has amazing components. Not many game inserts accommodate sleeved cards. Those big chunky engraved dice are wonderful. Just be sure to use poker chips or something similar instead the scoreboard.

-There is a deep game experience in here. New players will usually be beaten by experienced players, which I feel is how it should be.

-I find the experience of Seasons to be wildly varied from game-to-game. Part of it is the mix of cards in the beginning draft. Sometimes people won't roll many symbols to increase their summoning gauge. Sometimes the tempo will be slower or faster than average based on what's rolled but also how the players choose to influence it. There can be a huge disparity of score from game to game. I've seen winning games with a paltry 75-ish points to other games where someone has about 250 points. This makes close games all the more tense. It's also the reason I've played this game over 100 in the past 6 months.

-I'm happy that this is not a multiplayer solitare game. That said, there aren't so many directly confrontational cards that it feels like a 'take that' card game. It has just the right amount of interaction for my tastes.

-I feel this game is more varied and better balanced w/ different strategies to pursue than many of my favorite card games base sets*** (that includes Race for the Galaxy, Ascension, and Gosu). There are 2 cards I consider problematic (temporal boots - too good, balance of ishtar - too weak) but Balance of Ishtar and Idol of the Familiar were re-balanced from the first edition. Temporal Boots is still too good. 

I feel like everyone should try this game. Thankfully people have the opportunity to do so for free at the BGA website.

**I pretty much exclusive play this with only 2 players and feel the experience get's worse with the more players you add. 3 is still a decent game, but I won't even consider playing with 4.

***There used to be card games I prefer to Seasons but if I had to play just the base set of any of those card games, I would probably prefer to play Seasons.

I have a feeling that this is going to settle into a 6-7.  My initial thoughts are that the cards aren't super balanced.  And I always do poorly at games where I have to keep up on the text of a dozen cards in front of me and gain rewards or dole penalties based on various conditions written on the card.  It's too frustrating to keep forgetting to take my bonuses and either potentially lose as a result or feel like I'm cheating to request them after the fact.

That said, I do like the fact that the cards are limited to 9 for the game (broken out 3 at a time), plus draws, and that you have to have sufficient summoning strength.  So it's not a total card fest till the end of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Each of Seasons' mechanics I like well enough on their own. Dice-drafting, card combos and the like are fun, but when combined for this game are lesser than the sum of their parts. The initial card-draft and assignment to the different years, while strategically pivotal, makes the remainder of the game scripted and less interesting. The numerous variants and cards will keep each play distinct, but as a whole Seasons fail to create a game worthy of so many sessions.

Played once.  Ease into this one, there's pretty serious learning curve, because of complex card interactions -- the actual rules are pretty easy.  I feel like this is a game that I'm happy to play, but don't need to own, as I already have a number of other games that "scratch this itch" for me.

This is an enjoyable game, but the first game will be daunting.

I hate pixies, and would describe them before playing with any newbies.

The card drafting takes me back to sealed deck MtG tournaments of mid/late 90s.  I enjoy it quite a bit.  (Note: I was ranked back then.)

Has the feel of many familiar game concepts slapped together to create the game. It all works smoothly and plays quickly enough, but only without the card drafting. Adding a card draft phase would simply add an unholy amount of playing time and is probably not necessary. Yes, some of the cards appear more powerful than others but I'm not sure adding a card draft phase to the game will balance it all out. In any case, the game is fun enough, without the card drafting, for your standard economic-engine-to-VP type of game.

I really enjoy this one but I have yet to play with a group that has played enough to try out the advanced deck with drafting. Given that I already like the game so much with the basic cards, I can only see my enjoyment growing with some plays with a more experienced group.  I think that the mechanics of the game alone are very unique and cause for a lot of interesting decisions. I see lots of replayability with this one.

Great as a 2-player game.  With 3 it is good as long as the players can trust each other and you can more or less take simultaneous turns.

The cards in this game just interact in so many interesting ways.  I can see playing this quite a few times without tiring of it. 

This game is all about the draft.  Picking the cards and then seeing how you work with them, and refining that process.  It's fantastic.

I would rank this higher as I love the game; it is amazingly produced and the artwork is gorgeous, however it is cutthroat and requires a bit of knowledge to play. New players will be trounced by the more experienced players and due to the nature of my group, it doesn't come out that often, meaning when it does players aren't familiar with the cards and what they should be looking to draft. 

All that being said, I think it's fantastic! If you are in to card games this is a must.

Season has a design in which the mix and order of mechanics create a well-orchestrated progression, as opposed to dozens of otherwise great games where you're playing the same actions throughout.

There's enough card variety to maintain non-repeating draft pools, which keeps your early strategy changing from game to game. Throw in the expansions and you've got enough to keep it interesting for years of play.

No, that is not a typo. I have played this game over 1000 times. In addition to owning and playing it in real life, I play a lot on Board Game Arena. The interplay of cards is totally fascinating to me and some of the combos you can make are awesome. Replayability? Oh yes! In Spades. Where this game fails for me is the double card effect. You get somebody who has 2 dice of Malice and will re-roll every single turn, plus 2 Wondrous Chests and they are sitting on 10 points a turn. They don't play cards, they just sit on points *YAWN* Games are really boring then. In addition, if you have each opponent in a 3 player game with a Karin the Destroyer (or one player with both) and a good supply of energy tokens you can be decimated pretty quickly. Some cards can be used to great effect, some can be a bit lame. I very rarely see any use for the Beggar's Horn except its crystal point value. Also, cards are the soul of this game. The only way to get them is by dice roll. Sometimes you are sitting there with lots of summoning gauge and no cards come up (or your opponent takes them and re-rolls them), sometimes vice versa. For normal point optimisation goodness I play in person. Brutal, cutthroat and aggressive play is on BGA...just depends on what I'm in the mood for.

And now.. BAD:
- Too much downtime
- last year was boring for me, having played all my cards while others not
- graphics of the cards (not artworks! Just symbols and layout choices) and dice dwgs are unintuitive and awful
- not interesting take it or leave it game :)

This spell-casting card game inspired by M:tG has some interesting resource collection and spell-casting mechanics, but it's not in my wheelhouse of taste. It felt chaotic with 4P (which we played), so maybe it's better with 2P -- though I don't play 2P attack card games.

I love, love, love:
- card-drafting and dice-drafting
- the big, chunky dice

I dislike:
- that some card combinations can be pretty difficult to shake off or beat, and coming back to win is pretty much not going to happen...
- black-bordered cards (?!?)
- that the theme isn't particularly strong

Final verdict: Love playing it, but it does stink that some card combos just cannot be beaten.

Initially I really enjoyed the game idea, colors, and graphics. I thinked I could have fun imagining the strategies and learning the different cards combos...
Then I played 3-4 games, and I thinked I was understanding it, and had still some fun in figuring combos... but it seemed a bit too slow for me and a little boring to wait other player/s turn.
Then I played some other games and...bang it got REALLY BORING. Turn after turn just collecting resources, and waiting to get the right die before the enemy. Then wait minutes for a clever opponent to make combo combo, take this down, this up this down, and after 30 minutes of combo he has won by 3 points because you had been so bored to death that you forgot to use a power of one of your cards.
Or wait turns to draw a card because you don't ever get the good die?

Nah, this game needed 1 year more of development. It COULD have been a nice game, but with SEVERAL modifications.
As it stands, it's too much boring to mind playing. If I get an offer to play it by a friend who likes it, I will play, else it will not find space on my gametable, sorry!

Great game.  This is my replacement for Magic: The Gathering - that even my wife will play.  Nice fantasy theme with beautiful artwork.  Can't beat the huge chunky dice.  Also enjoy the idea of the changing seasons mechanic and limited hand that grows as the years change.  Both seem to really help the learning curve for new players and stave off A.P.  Really wish the changing of seasons theme was more blended into the card abilities/costs/flavor.

We liked Seasons a lot when we first got it, but went back to the game more recently, and without the familiarity with the card pool fresh in our minds, the game lost a lot.  We also confirmed that it was way less fun with more than two players, so didn't see it getting played often enough to keep. Of the games I've gotten rid of, Seasons was one of the tougher decisions - it's a solid game that I played a fair bit, but just didn't think I would play much anymore.
[b]previous comment:[/b]

I am usually not a big fan of draft-up-front in my games.  I don't like the feeling that I pretty much had the game lost before it started, because I chose poorly on the cards.  However, Seasons has enough variety, especially with the first expansion added, that I still enjoy it.  I like the variety of different paths to victory, and the way you can try to build an engine out of cards that synergize well.  I also really like the N+1 dice drafting mechanic.  This isn't a game I will necessarily always be quick to pull out, and I definitely feel it works best with two, but it's a good solid game.

Two three player games before rating it. It has a few presentation issues that could be a bit more friendly - bigger text, bigger spaces for the cubes.   Almost felt like Magic meets 7 Wonders meets Dominion but then there are the dice as well.  We played again straight away after the first " learning game".  Second game took 75 mins.  I enjoyed this, but the luck of the draw/draft and dice will not appeal to those who like to plan strategy and combos.  This is very much working with what you get, rather than planning how to get what you want.

After a single game this feels very clunky. Non of the actions seem to flow once you begin gameplay (the draft portion is second nature having played both 7wonders and MtG) and the initial game is very slow as you desperately try to get stars to be allowed to play cards.

Jumped straight in at the advanced game which was probably a mistake as we had a non-gamer join us at the last minute as a 4th player. This may have contributed to the clunky feel of the game.

Art work is stunning and the flavour of the game shines through however the theme could have been anything.

I hope there is more ways in which you can interact with your opponents i.e. bouncing cards back to hands or making them draw more cards, not just taxing them for actions. Familiars seem more powerful than magic items but that could have been because one player focused on familiars alone.

I think this is the kind of thing I was hoping for with quarriors where you are drafting a limited pool  of dice.

I also hope the clunky-ness was due to it being the first game we played and thus will diminish with more player, but I am not certain it will.

Something of an engine builder, the card play was much more important than I realised, and I didn't get cards that drove my game as well as my opponent. I'd play it again now I know it, but it's not quite my kind of game. Lots of text on the cards, ambiguous and confusing mix of wording.

:star::star::star::nostar::nostar: - Current rating.
PRO: short duration, nice graphics/components, drafting
CON: combos and powers are very straightforward/simple

There's a lot I should like in this game that I don't get from a lot of other games. I enjoy drafting, and this game has a simple 9-card draft. I enjoy dividing cards into prioritized piles (a very underused mechanic!). Combo-making is a favorite of mine. The art in this game is also nice.

But it's flat.

This game suffers compared to other "combo-making" games I like. There are a lot of them these days: Imperial Settlers, Deus, Impulse, and to a lesser extend Agricola, Le Havre, etc. Season catches the eye with good graphics, but delivers an overly simple game for my tastes. This is a great game to play with people new to combo games and card activations, but for me it's just not enough.

I've played more than once, but after a 2nd time, I realize that I don't really care for 'Magic' type games, or those where there isn't really a theme to them for me to get in to.  With this I'm just collecting some resources, and hoping that my cards match what resources I'm given.

Meh.

I had to re-read the directions on this game more than any other.  They're not actually that confusing, especially after you realize that half the "boards" you use are just there for keeping track of score, various point systems, or "time".  There's just a lot of minutia to understand, and strategy often works around it, so you can't just check a rule while in the middle of play.

Lots of different cards to choose from and lots of different strategies to try, so it has good replay-ability.  There's dice, but they're not so central that RNG-haters would be put off by it.

Pros
-Decent amalgamation of many different mechanics
-In-game actions make (some) thematic sense
-Game feels like a good length (and players can control it to some degree)
-Players can form a strategy from what they have in their hand and they know what is coming up later in the game due to drafting of starting cards
-LARGE unique dice

Cons
-Some swingy game moves/combos (e.g. look at next card of deck, gain mana equal to its cost, which can be from 0 to 7/max)
-Score board is very small, and score changes VERY often
-Feels like it could use some more variation (i.e. the game only two categories of cards - items and familiar)
-A lot of abilities that screw your opponents over and reduce their VP. For example, I ended my second game with 0 VP (but I still got points that couldn't be reduced from my other cards), and the score board goes up to 300.
-Individual cards (art) and theme is not memorable, nothing really holds it together and overall theme feels slapped on.

Egy gyönyörű játék, aminek a hangulata a játék során sajnos csak részlegesen jön át.
De a legnagyobb probléma vele, hogy kezdetei draftolás nélkül elviselhetetlen mértékű a szerencse szerepe, mivel a kártyák kiegyensúlyozása mégcsak haloványan se fedezhető fel. 

Ki kell próbálni draftolva, mert szeretném szeretni ezt a játékot. :)
-------
Azért draftolva is elég nagy a szerencse szerepe. Ez igazból egy hangulatos feeling játék, ahol nem annyira a győzelem semmint a szórakozás a fontos.
------------
Valamiért nem nagyon tud engem szórakoztatni, inkább idegesít. 4-en semmiképp se ülök le mellé többet, de háromnál is meggondolom. Olyan szintűvé válik több játékosnál a kiszámíthatatlanság, és az aránytalanságok, hogy az már fáj. 4-en játszva a 4. játékosnak pl. esélye sincs a győzelemre, mert mire le tudna tenni lapot már szét van szívatva, így beragad a játék legelején.

Seasons has many of the qualities I despise in Dominion and then adds some more of its own: Turns that last anywhere from 1 second to upwards of 5 minutes, a game that - while not necessarily decided - is very much set on its tracks immediately after the initial setup but goes on for very long, lots of different text-heavy cards to try to build combos with, too much downtime, and lots of specific card effects I don't particularly care about.

The dice drafting sounded quite interesting but turned out to be a fairly mundane affair. Some of my problems with the game would get better with mutiple plays I'm sure but the rest is sufficiently unpleasant that I'm not interested in investing that much time. The short version: Not my game at all.

RATING: 8.1
Good card game with a lot of interesting mechanics. Too many interesting mechanics when you first start playing, but they are all fun once you get it.

My one complaint seems to agree with many others here: the bulk of the game is drafting your cards and choosing which pile to put them in. After that (the first few minutes of the game) you're largely spending an hour seeing how those decisions play out. By the end of our games we're usually begging for more cards and swimming in elements. This hurts what would otherwise be a fantastic game. It doesn't happen every time, but it happens often enough.

Artwork is great and the game itself is really fun as well. Drafting your cards and deciding which cards will come available in which year gives the game some strategic value, but it's mostly about luck and tactics.

Great game with two players. When playing with 3 or even 4 players I think the game takes to long.

A beautiful elegant game about competing wizards with a misleading name and a confusing term for victory points (crystals) that I keep thinking is the mana for making spells/playing cards (energy). there's not much to the game, and not an excessive amount of components, but there is a deep layer of complexity and opportunity for combinations with multiple levels of play available for novices and experts as well as people who love to mess with each other.

At first I thought this game had some serious flaws but it's grown on me since. Need to find a good method of distributing the cards. Random sealed pool and the drafting they suggest are both unsatisfactory. The big dice are fun and the mechanics of play interlock quite nicely.

Świetna i z założenia dosyć szybka gra, działa dobrze na 2 osoby, przy większej liczbie osób może prowadzić do paraliżu decyzyjnego. Granie z draftem zmniejsza losowość, ale wtedy większą szansę mają gracze znający grę. Bardzo ładne grafiki, cieszą oko, genialne kości. Na plus jest też to, że można ją wyjąć z pudła i transportować komponenty nawet w małej torebce.

A lot of different cards you will be reading a lot. Harsh game on newbies so the game benefits the person sitting to the left of the newbie as it's all about drafting so the most important decisions you make are before you really understand the game. Also lots of tax cards so with max players you pop tax cards out early and cripple people for the rest of the game.

This is actually a game I would probably rate higher if I had more opportunities to play. If I were smarter, I'd play online through boardgamearena.com, however I rarely have the time to sit down and play as many games in a row as I would like to. I would love to find a group who I could play this with on a semi-regular basis, as I think it's a great, solid game that really is best when players are roughly at the same skill level.

Extremely good! Full of decisions but still very light.

P.S. And I hate the shoes card. :)

EDIT
After several more plays online... hmmm... it's not so cool - randomness might be a killer.
Good, medium weight family game. The theme doesn't add anything special - in my opinion it's fluffy and incoherent - why don't somebody make a new world for such a game? (see Last Will - same situation - medium weight, but there THE THEME makes the game!).

And I suck in this game. Can't play it well at all. :)

I really love this as a 2pl game.  Best with two players who are equally familiar with the cards.  Amazingly, most of the games between my wife and I come down to a 10 or 12 point difference, but sometimes our scores are close to 100 and sometimes as high as 250--just depends on the cards and the die rolls.  Drafting well keeps the scores close.  Blowouts are rare (but do happen).  Lots of variety = lots of replayability.

I did not enjoy this at all. While I can respect the skill in the art design, the illustrations were offputting and disturbing. They reminded me of some of those twisted Alice in Wonderland video games.
The game itself takes too long for the amount of decision making, and just never felt at all fun to me. I think the mechanics are sound, but this game was devoid of anything enjoyable.

Card variation and combining are very fun parts of the game.  Large custom dice,  super thick cards, and a very functional molded plastic insert accentuate the component quality. Actual crystals would have been more fun but less streamlined. The artwork,  I must admit, is what regrettably kept me from this new classic.  As the game play attracts me to it, so now does the artwork grow on me.  Lol

Played a solo against-myself game to learn the rules. Actually enjoyed it! Even though I was playing both hands, pleasantly tense towards the end with the scoring, both hands having taken very different approaches. Purple was more than 100 in front at the end, because it had focused on regular crystal gathering, but Orange had a huge number of high point cards. Came very very close to coming through at the end. Looking forward to playing with a real person!

A gaming buddy facetiously mentioned that he really wanted me to try Seasons. And why not! It's got almost everything I typically avoid in games: Text-heavy card drafting, tableau building in relative isolation, combos left and right, family-friendly graphic design. Hell yeah! 

So I sat down with this buddy who has been playing the game actively online and another friend, and started drafting pretty much blind. I got the two cards that made others give me a point every time they summoned a card, the one that made them give me a point every time the season changed, and the one that allowed me to discard an energy to make others lose 4pts. Oh, and the die re-roll one. For the first half of the game or so, I was well up the VP chart while the other two were at 0 or single digits. And then I won. Fucking ridiculous. 

Downtime when playing with more than just two can be painful.

Interesting card-based game - reminds me a bit of Race ft Galaxy.  Difficult to get to know the cards until you have played once, but gameplay is very straightforward.

Cards + Dice = Double Random Somewhat-Self-Playing Game
That wouldn't be so bad if it didn't drag so much.  Even with only 2P, turns could take far too long.  That would be forgiveable if I felt like I was actually *doing* something, building toward something.  Admitedly, this is after one play, but a second game is highly unlikely.  Few decisions beyond the initial card sort seemed to have more than one worthwhile option.
Oddly enough, I like Scary Tales which is dice and cards with even less decision, but it plays very quickly.

I've only played this two-player so far...and it's been a lot of fun!
My favorite part of Dominion, is looking at the initial layout of all the cards available and pre-planning which ones I think will work best...well, thats the first half of this game too! I use all 50 types of cards, and do the random draft. (9 per player, who switch hands after picking a card, 18 total) It's quite rewarding to see your plans work in the long run, and over time, if they don't, it's still a fun scramble to maximize your point gains!

The theme is mixed, I love the art and the way the cards work, but the season wheel reminds me that I'm just building a points machine with a turn limit thats able to be modified....still, I like this MORE than 7 Ages/Innovation (it seems to take the good parts of those, ie: drafting, building, tactical reactions, player interaction; and combine them.)

Edit: After more 2 player plays, this game just doesn't work with 2 players. The first player has a huge advantage,  the card draw result on the dice is OP and there are so few die that it shows up rarely enough that the entire game is decided by who rolls the most card draws. I'll give it a chance with 3 players, perhaps that will balance a few things, but I don't see what people like in this game.

A bit random and some cards are just better than others. Probably better with more people and the "advanced" cards. Very beautiful game, though!

This is one a game with one of the largest discrepancies I've seen between the person teaching and people who have played less. As someone who owns games and often has to teach them, it wouldn't work in my collection as I'd just smoke everyone just like I got smoked when I got taught. At the same time, it's a good game, and while the art is cool...it didn't quite pull it off as a good theme. The dice rule though and everything about them is the best part of the game. I would give this a 7 or 8 if you could guarantee playing with only people of your skill level.

Good game, nice idea and artwork, however the game flow is not very smooth, the rules regarding cards aren't often straightforward enough. However nice and good looking game to play sometimes as 2 player game in some occasions.
The main problem, why this game cannot reach 8-9 rating category is because of cards. Dices are good, board and mechanics are fine, however cards seems to be quite unbalanced - some are too powerful on attack, some are meant to be for strategy, however the game is more tactical than strategical. Fix the cards, make them balanced and so that they don't impact smooth game play and I'll rate this game much higher. Dice, seasons board and transmutes are very good, those do not need to be changed.

Not the quick, addictive card game that I was expecting. Plays more slowly than Dominion, 7 Wonders and Race for the Galaxy.  However, it is when you play online!!  Rating is 8 for online play.  Probably down to a 7 when playing a cardboard version.

However, the opportunity for comboing is immense (might be that there are better combos here than in the above). Drafting is always amazing. Short and long term planning is useful, always balancing the immediate points grab with the slow buildup of summoned power cards.

Unfortunately, exploring the cards is more entertaining than mastering the combos. That, I think, is why people feel the game is short lived (with only 50 unique power cards and 20-25 coming out in a 2p game). If more decks are designed for the game, I would be very interested as the system is quite enjoyable (but only as good as the cards that have been designed for it).

Rating dropped for 2 reasons:
1) Takes far too long to play in person. I only play on BoardGameArena now.
2) The deck gets old very quickly, as suspected. The same combos are used from game to game.

RATING: 6
As far as engine-building point games go, Seasons is just too brutal on the weaker player (which I've been on both ends of). Not just that they usually lose (which is true of most great games), but that they get swamped so fast that they have to endure a long game of watching someone else activate a bunch of actions to extend their lead even more. It's almost like an elimination-game feel with euro timing.

Meh... I really don't know. I think the cards are horribly powerful, and maybe unbalanced. It may all boil down to what you get and when.

Feels like Magic, but an actual boardgame. Drafting is a mechanism I like a lot, and the design of the cards is awesome in function and appearance. The game as a whole is  quite visually attractive. Can really breeze through it, pretty low overhead from a teaching perspective as well. Lots of depth, not many very clear strategies have shown up, let alone anything dominant. Card synergies are everywhere though, so while the drafting doesn't feel like a grand design coming together it's a nice crunch of trying to maximize what you've got.

Definitely better at two than three, don't want to try four. Balance is interesting, some cards stick out right now but probably due to inexperience. Insert is barely too small for sleeved cards but I squeeze them in there anyway.

After looking at this game, I never really gave it a second look (even though the art is quite nice) but when I finally played it, I was very glad I did.  It features mechanisms that anyone familiar with any CCGs or LCGs will grasp quickly and intuitively.  Like any game with lots of cards and text, it can take a while to get to know all the cards, but once you get to play it through a few times, the gameplay speeds up dramatically.

There's a lot to like about this game. Great mechanics and a well integrated theme. Fairly complex without being fiddly. My only complaint is that the game seemed to wind down rather that build up. I only played one game, so it may have been an anomaly, but the last round and a half was rather boring. We didn't have any more cards to play, and we took the same actions repeatedly as we tried to add to more points. The outcome seemed fairly inevitable well before it was over. 

If I play more games and a different mix of cards results in a better end game, I'll probably bump up my ranking to an 8.

- player interaction is pretty limited; so it isn't my kind of game.  yes, your cards and the dice you take sometimes affect the other players, but you have to play the cards you have, and you are going to take the dice that work for your cards.

- IMHO, all of the interesting aspects of this game happen at the beginning with the draft and the assignment of the cards to the 3 phases.  This is bad for beginning or casual players.  It is also bad for pacing; the climax of the game is going to depend on a bunch of luck-based things that happen long after you have committed to a course of action.

- the actual score of who is winning is not tracked.  Unless you go to the tedious task of adding up everyone's cards every turn, you don't know who is winning.  Since the card info is open, the VP should be tracked.

- I'm not sure that adding players adds to the game.  It probably works way better as a fast two player game, than an hour or two long four player game.

Perhaps I'm betraying my inability to see depth in a game that I'm just not good at. It seems to me you simply buy and play as many cards as you can. I don't get it.

RATING: 3
Nothing new here: select an action die from the common pool, gain resources and spend them to play special power cards or convert them to victory points. It doesn't sound too bad, but luck plays a huge role.

The cards seem to have some attempted balance between cost, usefulness and victory point value, but their powers are all over the place. In my only game, I played a card that allowed me to draw four cards and play one of them for free, and I was lucky to draw a 30-point worth card that would normally cost 20 points. That is obnoxious. And I'm not fond of having a dozen cards with text in front of me, either.

The game is also very abstract and the silly cartoony art doesn't make it any better.

I initially bought this because of its two-player sweet spot, for my sister and I to play. We both love the game, but to my surprise, so does our mother! She was attracted by the game laid out on the table and persuaded to join in on a game. 

We now play as many three-player as two-player games and I like both. The two-player game is and feels quicker; a three-player game is longer, but I can enjoy the slower pace and like watching the other players play their cards.

In many ways this game reminds me of Catan Card Game, which I like, but I like Seasons much better. So if you like Catan Card Game, I'd say you'll like Seasons. 
In both games you use resources to buy cards, which, all in their own way, earn you points. In Catan Card Game your resources get dictated by the dice, whereas in Seasons you can always choose between a minimum of two dice, allowing a better fit for your cards.

suggested by a couple friends so I was excited to sit down and try it.  But, ultimately it was just building the best combos with the cards you had.  Just really not that interesting to me, although one of the 'card players' say me playing it and asked about it.  I told him I thought he's like.  I'll play it again, but I'm not looking for it again.

What a great game.  It has a lot of flaws, like imbalanced cards and weird components that make the game hard to deal with, but replacing some of the components makes it easier.  Plays great with any amount of players.  Artwork is awesome.  Tons of replayability.  The barrier to entry is a little steep, but the challenge of the wizard contest is well worth getting good at this game.  Reasonably priced for a great game.

RATING: 6.7
An interesting card game that is heavily influenced by the dice.  It's an interesting concept and generally works well but even with drafting the card balance can skew the game heavily in one player's favor from the start.  A wide variety of cards adds variety and replayability but increases the learning curve for new players.  

The theme stands out and is very immersive.  The artwork is superb and components are nice quality.

So colorfull, so pretty.

So you are wizard in a competition going on during an entire year. Love the card drafting although with such a large pool of cards now (with both extension) you sometimes ends up with cards that don't combo well together. I love the principal of the game, but sometimes, some games it's harder to click. Maybe more plays of this would help.

I like this game, but I'm not sure about how much. It can be really fun when things are working for you, the thing is, you won't know if they are until a year (in game time) too late. The art is gorgeous and that is a BIG plus for me, everything looks bright and colourful and delicious, but I wish this game had a little more humour and theme. Definitely worth a try, though.

EDIT: This gets much better with play time. Advice, be proactive, calculate the results and if your strategy isn't working get more cards!

Surprisingly good! I was concerned it was going to be too overlong, but gameplay was certainly engaging enough. The decisions are mostly front-loaded on the draft, which is unfortunate--your choices after you draft your cards aren't always as consequential as you drafting decisions--but this was awfully fun nonetheless.
[EDIT] Yeah, there are too many good drafting games now. Seasons can't hold its own.

El joc es basa en un draft de cartes que es fa al principi de la partida i en tres fases que es repeteixen on es juguen accions mitjançant daus. L'objectiu és buscar combos entre les cartes.

Atzar en la tirada de daus i cartes desnivellades, a més de que hi ha poca varietat (50 cartes diferents amb dues copies de cada)

The game is good. Interesting choices, yet casual feeling. Great artwork.

Drafting phase is fun with combo/synergy-hunting, overall cost balancing and planning.

The game cleverly forces players to divide the drafted nine cards into starting hand and two 3-card batches which are acquired later in the game. This makes game flow smoothly as there is less possibilities between which cards to play during the 'tournament', the actual playing phase the game.

The different resource type distributions and conversion rates to VPs between different seasons add nice planning, timing and risk-taking element into the game. The seasons/years circle is also a good intuitive way to represent the timeline of the game.

The length of the game is ideal, not too short not too long. There is great variety between games, because of the sizable pool of cards. Also the card effects are well designed, varied and offer interesting combinations and synergies to watch for.

The bonus actions make the game a lot of more forgiving and dampens a bit the randomness of the dice. The draw a card effect of the dice is really good as it opens the game a bit for more uncertainty.

Seasons is primarily a card game, with drafting and hand management being the primary keys to success. Each player will draft a 9-card hand, then split it into 3 piles of 3, one for each year in the game. These cards generally have costs that must be paid in resources in order to get the benefits they offer (which almost always includes victory points). The resources themselves come from the dice. Each round, the starting player rolls the dice and picks one of them. Each player in turn order also selects one. These dice provide the resources needed to pay for the cards. 

The cards have some duplication, which is good for familiarity in drafting, but also good in the sense that multiple copies can sometimes really help a certain strategy. It seems that there are a lot of different paths to victory, with plenty of room for adaptation. This flexibility and broad strategic scope are really admirable given the relatively small amount of cards. Unfortunately, it seems this game plays better with fewer players. With the full complement of four, accidental chaos is a big problem. It is very easy to accidentally get in the way of other players' goals simply by pursuing your own, not to mention the fact that there are quite a few harshly interactive cards. It's still fun with more players, but it won't reward long-term planning quite as well.

The dice and cards are good quality, nicely illustrated. Unfortunately, the rules are ambiguous about certain timing issues and whether or not certain abilities are mandatory. The scoring track is pitifully small and easily bumped. The terminology is sometimes confusing and alternates inexplicably between symbols and the actual term in the card text. These are generally minor, but it still seems oddly sloppy in what is an otherwise very polished game. 

All in all, Seasons seems like it could really have legs and combines two underused mechanics (drafting and dice selection) into a very interactive hand management game that should appeal to eurogamers and CCG players alike. Nevertheless, like so many CCGs, it seems at its best when played 1 on 1.

Hey, whaddya know, this is actually really fun. Some cards seem to be considerably stronger than others, but most of the time creative play and drafting will take care of that. The pieces are a little "floaty" - so don't bump the table.

RATING: 8
Great as a two player game, okay for three. Never touch it with four. It could benefit from some more interaction, but as it is, it's an exceedingly clever card-comboing game with enough flavor to hide the fact that you're essentially just racking up VPs.

RATING: 9.3
After one play - Good 2 player. Casual feel with some depth.  Rules were read, learned and memorized in 15 minutes, but the game play was deep.  Definitely lots of ways to win.   Drafting covers the player interaction.  Unique theme in that you are battling for "years".  Downtime can be long, but that's only a problem if you don't like it.  I don't mind downtime or AP - tells me i'm getting a good game from the other person and they are having fun.

     At first thought, most of the strategy comes from the drafting at the beginning of the game, but two things come into play during the second phase : the high interaction with the other players through the dice and the timing needed to gain the right energy tokens(when and which dice to take also have a big affect on this).  Which cards are in the draft pool does come down to luck, but I think some gamers who will put this game down as a 'luckfest' need to learn a hard lesson : sometimes it's the better thing to do to sacrifice a card you may want in order to keep your opponent from getting a card they need. It is going to be difficult to block your opponent well while gaining crystals yourself.  

     Negative : The blandness of the card effects is completely disappointing.  Like I say below, no cards are broken, but on a whole they are too powerful. An expansion that adds more depth seems necessary.  

     Also, this is nothing like MTG. There are also no broken or too powerful cards.  If someone tells you either of these two things, stop listening to their advice.

Edit : Couple hours after first play and still thinking about how I could do better.  

Edit : second play - It's just a fun game that you will enjoy.  Play with two players and you get a nice 30m to 45m game.

Edit : Good with four players also.

Edit : great game.

While Seasons doesn't offer anything new individuval mechanics, the way in which older mechanics are put together is at the time both refreshing and crisp. The general design is very clean and simple (which makes it easier to teach and to jump in) while the variety of cards is how means that the game offers many different configurations of possible possibilities. For a game that is somewhat of a race (to the most crystals) and that rewards snowballing combinatorics, this game maintains a certain calmness to it that is relaxing. The art and the components make this game all the more 'magical'.

Also, my partner likes this.

Gorgeous artwork, no theme.
The components are terrible, the playerboard & the VP track are way too small and the cubes showing you what your stats are can fall off so easily & then you're screwed.

Also keeping track of VPs is a pain in the ass! You have to constantly change VPs to a degree where i didn't care about who's going to win at all. One player got rid of a certain card just so he wouldn't have to change VPs for every action anyone else was doing.
That is just really, really bad game design!

I played this game at boardgamearena.com first It seemed to be a good one. I kept playing this online until i lost 4 games because of pure luck. There is a card called Necromancer Crown which is double or nothing. You are not allowed to discard a card because there isn't enough options to draw another one, but if you draw a card with 0 victory points you gets nothing. After 50 online games we bought the original box, we played it once and i don't want to play it ever again as Necromancer Crown came again, and ruined my whole game...

Pros / Cons:
-The basic idea and mechanics seems to be working well.
-The interaction between the players are high.
-The theme and artwork are cathing your eyes.

-The luckfactor is huge i mean it is HUGE especially with the double or nothing Necromancer Crown card.
-You need an administrator just to push the victory points cubes when every single turn ends - it just kills the fun.

Interesting mix of strategies and management of resources.  It's a little harder for someone new to get into than Dominion in the sense that until you've seen all the cards, you really can't know what to anticipate.  Things are easy to understand though and allow for some interesting manipulation of the game.  Different resource systems all come together in a way where cards feel like they have a fairly good balance.  A little too luck-based perhaps, but that goes along with the cutesy theme.  I'd definitely like to try it with the draft method to help weed out a small amount of initial draw luck.

RATING: 7.5
Seasons is a slick little card game, reminding me (at least a little bit) of MtG.

The game is full of colorful artwork, nicely designed packaging for the bits, and some of the most popular (and sizable) dice to ever be seen on BGG.  The dice are used to generate available actions- always one more die than #players, so there are a set of randomized options each round.

Basically the game is a contest set over 3 years, divided by months but also by three month long seasons. In each season the power of some of the 4 elements is more or less plentiful, and this cycles around predictably. There may be an opportunity to cache that magical power as crystals- and the more scarce an elemental power the more crystals can be formed of it.

Crystals are sometimes used as a commodity in the game, but they are also simply VPs for the game-end.

Of course, player-sorcerers may also need those crystals to summom magic items or familiars- and you either need a source for rare power or need to save/collect it for that use sometimes. In addition to special effects (1x or Multi-use) Magic items and faniliars are also generally worth some VP at game end, and this is perhaps 
the more effective way of gaining Crystals/VPs.

The game is set with a multi-player solitaire deck of 30 cards (2x for each card), but also includes a far more interactive set of 20 cards (2x for each card) once the game is learned.

Each player starts with 9 cards, and then a card draft is run where players select a single card each round. Players then set aside 3 cards for both the 2nd and the 3rd years, and start with 3 cards in-hand.

At this point I've played about 3 games with varying counts, all with the less interactive card set. I think the game is slick enough to be fun even with the basic deck, and I expect it will improve with the interactive cards. I'm starting this at a 7.25- it's a nice little production with superior production values, and it's not out to separate you from your hard-won cash like Collectors' or Living Card games (though there IS an expansion on the way already...).

Increased to a 7.5 after playing w Interactive cards.

This is a game I'm fond of, but it has issues. It also hasn't been well received by my friends. The game has a LOT of moving parts and it's difficult to wrap your head around them.

Not sure how deep the game is strategically - but I can foresee at least another 30 games or so of interesting play. Rating can go up if I still love the game after that many plays. On the other hand, the rating could go down if I feel that the game lacks the depth to capture my interest after this many plays.

Worried about the balance of cards (even with the draft) and with the game becoming less interesting as every card becomes familiar.

“Winter is coming.” -Eddard Stark

GAMEPLAY
Players are the mages of Xidit come together to show off their powers to become the archmage. Each turn the starting player rolls special dice to determine what energies are available for the wizards to craft their items. The Dice are specific to each season and have more or less energy symbols depending on the season. The dice energies have one or two winter, spring, summer, or fall and sometimes one of two different seasons. In addition the dice may indicate that the player can play more power cards, gain a power card, gains crystals, or can transmute energy into crystals. The power cards build the mages’ capabilities. Some powers are simple, use two winter energy to get 20 crystals. Some powers rely on the opponent’s resources, spend two autumn energy to copy an opponent’s energy pool and add it to your own. Some powers make it easier for the mage, spend one energy of each type and for the rest of the game calling powers takes one less energy. The mages look to play as many power cards as possible as they add to the victory point total in addition to their effects. The game is broken down into three years and each year into 12 months. The turns move faster or slower depending on the power dice remaining from the turns’ roll. There are two copies of fifty different power cards in the game and the rules recommend using only the first 30 for the first few play throughs as the effects of the last 20 are more complicated and interact in with each other more. With so many powers there is a lot of replay-ability. At the end of the third year each player totals played powers and crystals, the mage with the most points wins the title of Archmage.

COMPONENTS
The card board elements of the game are the good standard, gamers have come to expect from Asmodee. The energy tokens fit into the top of each player board and the symbols all clearly indicate what they are. The dice are much larger than standard size, so aggressive dice rolling should be avoided. The artwork is top notch with interesting details on the player board and the power cards. There are a lot of colors in play because blue, green, yellow, and red are used for the seasons and player colors are orange, grey, brown, and purple.

THEME
I don’t think the world of Xidit has shown up anywhere else. So this new generic magical world has more exploring to be done in it. Everything that has been presented in this box fits and builds a unique high fantasy world. The flow of time on the circular time board feels smooth and is very well implemented into gameplay. The game turns are fast and building power divided by the mages makes for interesting game choices.

WHO IS IT FOR?
This game can cover a wide range of gamers. Those as young as ten can handle Seasons and because of its short play time, under an hour, will work great for families. Seasons also works well for heavier gamers as there are tons of possibilities with 50 different power cards in the game. The game plays 2 to 4 and more players offers more interaction for more interesting gameplay.

RATING: 8
Drop-dead gorgeous production values slathered over a so-so apparatus.  After two plays I'm into it and looking forward to more, but will henceforth heed the common warning that 4p is just too much.  Downtime was brutal and who knows, maybe it picks up with familiarity but I'm not interested in finding out.

It feels like an 8 but I'm gonna make [i]Seasons[/i] work for it.

Also:  Big chunky dice FTW!

[b]After 4 plays:[/b]  I'm pretty sure this is just a 2p experience.  Even with only 3p the downtime during two consecutive super-turns (with card play and effects chaining on and on and on...) is an enthusiasm killer.  Especially when my stupid turn is "I gain two energy.  Next!" followed by two more super-turns.  [i]Gaaah.[/i]

[b]After 6 plays:[/b]  It's an 8.  Play time's picking up as we become more familiar with the cards and we haven't even cracked the "advanced" set of 20.  Just plain friendly and appealing.  What can I say?  It's... [i]nice[/i]... like a warm, French bubble bath.  I can soak.

UPDATE:  [i]I slipped on the Temporal Boots, thinking I was all kinds of clever—only to find myself sprinting backwards, screaming, into the Port-A-Potty to suck yesterday's dump up through the hole.[/i]

I wasn't 100% about this purchase, so I was tentative when I did my first solo play test of it to learn the rules. I found it dull and too deterministic. Then I played it with my wife. Before the game started we realized I had made a mistake: The cards you draft at the start of the game are not the only ones. A 'draw' action is from the deck with the rest of the cards, not from upcoming years. No clue why I thought that. That really changed things as new power cards can come into play. My second mistake was to underestimate how much a second player would add to the game that I could never replicate by playing both players in my play testing. In the end, I find this game to be fun and we are always surprised that the game lasts us 50 minutes or so because it feels much faster than that. Very engaging.

One of the best two-player experiences I ever had. Period. I know the cards are not properly balanced to the utmost. I know the "theme" isn´t for everyone. I know the dice really can screw with your plans. But for what it is, a 45-60 Minute drafting game with lots of interaction, replayability and tactics, it is a marvellous game....I had so much fun playing this with my wife countless times (more than 50 plays at a rough estimate): This is one of the best games of all time in my book.

According to some Magic-playing colleagues this is rather like a simplified Magic the Gathering, but without the collectable aspect. There's a LOT to get your head around first time you play as you need to read the cards as you draft, knowing the deck is rewarded big time here. Drafting and rotating the start player eliminate as much of the luck as possible in a cards and dice game, but the laws of probability still apply and you might be denied that big build by being one resource short. A nice theme and fun to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Nice components. I enjoy the way the dice are drafted and used as a resource but aren't actually the central aspect of the game that they appear to be; instead it's a card combo game with lots and lots of cards. I like card combos, and I was intrigued by the need to earn the right to put down a card. However, the game seemed a little too "take that" for my tastes, and it can be difficult to make any real headway with the crystals as they are constantly getting knocked down. (1 play)

RATING: 6.5
Addictive game. One of the few games out there that is better with the lowest number of players(2) instead of the highest(4). The downside with 4 players is that scoring can become quite confusing between rounds. You often have situations where all players have to give one player a point at end of round. Sometimes this will happen every round, and sometimes every few rounds. CAN be confusing. 

EDIT 9/2/2013: Dropped from an 8 to a 6. The game is still FUN to play, but scoring is a pain in the ass, and the game drags quite a bit with 4 players. There's a lot of steamlining that could make this game waaaay better. It's better to play this on BGA

I don't get the hype. Lazy design, unbalanced cards, adding a draft mechanic doesn't stop the cards being thoughtlessly designed. And adding a second copy of every card rather than designing more unique cards smacks of uninspired development and narrow design space.

RATING: 10
The interaction between cardplay and resource management is like candy it's so immediately rewarding, flavorful, and addictive. And I cannot say enough about the artwork, which is some of the most dazzling, gorgeous imagery I've seen since Omen a Reign of War. Seasons has a "light" theme, but it certainly integrates itself well with the mechanics.

We used the prebuilt beginner decks, and all of us immediately picked up on the synergies between cards. With only one of us having played even once, I was afraid Seasons might drag. It didn't.  It picked up right away, and with little to no downtime steamrolled right to the end. I used crystal beads to replace the scoring track, and this made the management of collecting, stealing, and spending them infinitely more intuitive and natural, and likely sped up the game. 
2P: It works surprisingly well with two. Playtime is an hour or less.
3P: This game's sweetspot. Perfects the player interaction and game length.
4P: If players don't overanalyze their turns it can work, otherwise it stretches a relatively light game into an uncomfortably long experience.

This game is really card-combo-licious, but that's not a flavor I really like. The abstract theme and low player interaction don't help. It starts off OK at first, but by the end everyone has 10 or special powers in front of them, such that I can't keep track of all of mine and don't particularly enjoy watching ther other players keep track of theirs. Oh, and at the very end, might as well break out a claculator for the scoring.

Very pretty game with cool artwork, and the card combos can be a lot of fun. The drafting aspect is great and lets you work out a strategy for the rest of the game, but it's not set in stone because you can never be sure exactly what resources are going to be available on a given round. Some of the cards have a take that feel to them which can be frustrating, but I just have so much fun that I don't care.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
This game does a lot of things well, but unfortunately is let down by some major problems:

1)A lot of the cards add some serious fiddlyness to the vp track during a turn or at the end of a round/season

2)the game can be very slow, and dull when it's not your turn

3)getting points early on can be good in some games, but in others (if other players have drafted vp taxing cards) they can be useless

4)the draft at the start is the most important part of the game, if you do badly through bad luck or not getting any good combos then it's game over unless you get lucky with card draw (from dice or cards) later in the game

5)there are too many useless cards in the deck which you may be forced to take in the draft or draw during the game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Seasons has wonderful art, great components, and interesting mechanics.

Where the game loses me is with its collectible game-style card interactions. Toward the end of the game, there are too many interactions and effects to try and remember.

Additionally, many of the powerful combinations aren't initially apparent, making this a game where one can almost guarantee losing in the game's initial card draft.

There's much I like about Seasons, but it doesn't have the kind of depth I am looking for in a board game.

Maybe it was only my 1st playing (and we did play with beginner setup) but seems like a fair amount of luck... one guy got both "30 point at game end" cards that he was able to build for free because he got the "build a card for free" card that he got to use twice because he was able to bring it back into his hand.  He didn't win, a more experienced player did, but I had trouble drawing any valuable cards.

I'd play again, give it a try w/the drafting setup, but I like "heavier" games and the bgg avg on this one is 2.7

Seasons is one of those games that is deceivingly simple at the outset, but which reveals more layers the more a person plays.  Players try to collect the most crystals, all the while building their summoning powers to play cards that help them gain even more crystals, or cause other players to lose crystals.  The unique dice, the simple setup, the quick game play, the back and forth nature of the cards, and replayability make this a keeper.  One of the other good things about Seasons is that it plays equally good at 2, 3, and 4 players.  The artwork is a little cheesy for me.  I think it would have worked better with a classic, dungeons & dragons type theme, but I can respect the designers were trying for something more unique.

Fun drafting game with amazing art. The dice are beautiful and make for some interesting decisions based on what you roll.

The gameplay is a bit like MtG with some cards that you play in front of you but it feels so good to draft some combos and see them come into play.

The resource management is also very interesting as you can essentially sell resources during other seasons where they might be more scarce for a bit of an extra bonus.

Played a few times with the preset decks, thought it was boring and mathy (not necessarily a bad thing, but was bad when paired with 'boring'). Played once with drafting at the beginning and now want to play it nearly all the time.

Fantastic, beautiful game. After several plays, the game is holding up well, but there seems to be an ongoing point of confusion - ALL cards are Power Cards, and there are two types - Magic Items are the purple Power Cards, and Familiars are the orange Power Cards.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (February 2013)

At first I didn’t like the game very much, I thought it was a regular game when I played the apprentice mode without the draft, however, with the draft this game is easily a 7.0 for me, a good game I’m usually willing to play. I love card games and this is a very good card game. The art is gorgeous and the game components are great. 

The rules are fairly easy to get, but the game has some interesting decisions from beginning to end. The game is a little light for my taste, but I do like it.
 
For me, Seasons is played best with 2 players, fun with 3 players. With 4 players the downtime is excessive for me so I won’t play it that way. I plan to buy it in the near future.

With more plays, I now see that the game is a deeper that I initially thought (but still a light-medium ggame). I really like it but now I refuse to play it with 3 players. Seasons is a two player only game, otherwise the downtime increases a lot as does the luck factor.

I really enjoy Seasons, but only with 2 players. These days I refuse to play with 3 or more players. I find the game very compelling (thus the new rating) and I definitively want to explore it further. I will buy it soon (perhaps I already did, I don’t remember all my purchases these days :).

Being a Magic fan, I found Seasons to be quite classical in its mechanisms: time goes by, you get to roll dice and you invoke magical objects with effects using energy tokens. It plays really nicely, although it's a bit long (this is why it's best with 2 players). I customized the deck, as some cards seemed over-powered or unbalanced for a 2-player game. I am planning to buy expansions in the future (the box seems to have plenty of space for them!) which might make the game more intense.

Too much going on in this game and in a bad way.  There are like 15 competing mechanisms firing at once and I'm not quite sure why.  The artwork is brilliant, but the theme makes no sense, and I just can't grasp the point of the interplay between the cards and the chits and the dice and the seasons.  If you'll indulge a brief metaphor, this is like a bad "director's cut" of a decent movie but there was no editing and what was formerly a tight 100 minute film, is now a 240 minute directionless blob.  I would say that I would never play this game again.

RATING: 7.5
Wow, two plays in (3 players each time) and I'm blown away by how much fun this is. Look past the Magic-style jargon and the gameplay is actually pretty simple, but there are a lot of choices in play, a reasonable amount of interaction for a Euro and just enough of a random element from the dice to avoid 100% predictability without it degenerating into utter chaos.

Stunning looks (especially if you pimp it up with a actual crystals for scoring), and the central interaction between the dice and the season wheel is unique and very fun.

As others have said I'd avoid playing with 4 to avoid excessive downtime, but for 2 of 3 it's one I'm happy to recommend.

RATING: 8.5
- This game is great, but not for everyone. It can come across as heavy-ish in weight, similar to Race for the Galaxy.
- Aesthetics and components are excellent.
- This game is all about the cards; building and executing an engine. 
- There is so much variety in the cards which makes for heaps of replay-ability, particularly if you include either of the expansions which are both pretty good. I have both but I don't think I'd like the game any less if I didn't have any. 
- The drafting at the start is so good because it allows you to decide on a strategy (somewhat) and structure your game to make sure you have particular cards available in the early, mid and late game. I wish other games like Race for the Galaxy did this.
- Symbology is clear and consistent, but there will probably be moments where you need to refer to the rule book to see how a card works, particularly in combination with another.
- Teaching is okay, but the game will probably be daunting to new players.
- This game can suffer from a runaway-leader problem as there's not much players can do to slow a single player down. From memory, all, or at least most of the take-that(ish) cards affect all other players not just one.

11/28/2015 - I'm upping my rating from a 6 to an 8. I think the learning curve and the downtime with 4 players combined to give me a bad first experience. I gave it another chance, though, and I'm so glad I did. This is a great strategic game with a lot of strategy and fun combos.

10/17/2013 - This is a... I don't know. You draft cards, then you roll and draft dice for resources to play those cards. Some resources only show up in certain seasons. It occasionally has some interesting decisions, but ultimately, I just don't find it interesting.

It feels like a good game, and it is looking good, having good mechanics. Sorry, that the cards taking so much time and space in the game.

A beautiful card game with a dice drafting mechanic. Summon power cards and collect crystals to end the game with the most prestige. Don't make the mistake of describing this to people as "A bit like Magic" - it's not. There's no playing out of turn and there's not much directly affecting other players. A great game which is very different to Magic!

RATING: 6
After a straight up card draft to start the game, you then draft a die each turn to give you energy (to play cards), draw another card, increase your potential tableau size, and/or simply get points. Sometimes you can transmute energy into points rather than spending it on playing cards from your hand. Combinations of cards have you manipulating all of these actions, and other cards, to collect massive quantities of points in short order. The game is paced by a 12 step rondel that moves 1-3 steps per turn (dictated by the die NOT chosen), so you can also manipulate the number turns to be played as well. Different energies transmute to different amounts of points depending on where you are on the rondel.

It's a hard game on new players because of the need to draft your base hand for that entire game before you start playing. So, I should write off a few learners games before I really decide how much I like it, but the truth is I don't know if there are enough interesting decisions in-game to make it worthwhile for me. I felt a bit stuck with my pre-game draft with precious little influx of new in-game options. Your tableau can get up to 15 cards (!), which is a lot to keep track of (even 10 feels like a lot to me), and I kept feeling the urge to re-read every card every turn to make sure I wasn't forgetting anything. And I still forgot stuff. And so did my experienced opponent! Even if I respect them, I have trouble loving games that have me doubting and constantly checking and rechecking my personal tableau. I much prefer finding opportunities on a dynamically changing shared play space! Seasons is not a bad game, but I'm pretty confident it is not for me.

An interesting engine-building game, where the cards are propelled by custom dice specific to each season of the game. Much better when played with the initial drafting variant, but it also makes this game hard to teach. New players won't have much idea how the cards work together, and a random deal of nine cards won't mesh well. Once you get over this minor learning hurdle though, there's an enjoyable game to be played, with some satisfying combos thanks to a plethora of different power cards. And once everyone is familiar with the ins and outs, plays in a remarkably short span of time - making it easy to squeeze in between meatier games, or to play multiple times at a go.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I had low expectations due to the combo-building part but Seasons was a positive surprise. It's more a combination of 7 Wonders and Race for the Galaxy than the combomania I dread in Dominion. Tableau building games are the one type where I can stand engine building. Probably, because it's not so much about getting a few killer combos to play repeatedly but rather a complete working build. 
Compared to 7 Wonders, Seasons offers a broader more complex decision space with the initial draft of 9 cards that players distribute equally to the three ages. From the start on, players know almost all cards in the game and have to prepare a long-term plan. Some randomness in addition to the cards is mixed in by the dice, and in the base version a few minor targeted effects are added which are fine with me as they target all players similarly. Hopefully, the advanced version with more interactive cards beyond the initial set of 30 doesn't spoil my impression.  
While Seasons is a nice change of pace from 7 Wonders for gamers, it will be too much for occasional gamers. It's on par with Race for the Galaxy or Glory to Rome in terms of demand.

I love this game so far. Rating will rise or fall after we get into the more advanced ways to play.

It is my favorite game to play with my wife. And I spend more time gaming with her than I do with anyone. The art is top notch, as are the rest of the components. 

One complaint. The counters! Why a counter board? It looks great, but all it takes is a light bump to taint the results of such an amazing game. Still my favorite, but there must be something that I can do to avoid this happening again.

After 1 play:

The bright colors of the cover and the name of the game seem to run counter to the magical theme of this game. I had fun in this game, but there just seemed to be lots of cards which can be abused for mega points. It is a bit disheartening to be plodding along scoring a few measly points here and there and then someone comes along and scores 50+ points in one turn. However, the game might be more like Glory to Rome in that all the outrageous combos in fact balance each other to make an interesting game.

Love the two drafting phases, and the huge stack of cards with many different effects means that all games will be different. However, it suffers from two large problems: (1) some combos make the rest of the game mindless after setting them up; and (2) in the late stages of the game, that is a lot of powers you have to keep track of, and it's easy to forget.

Season is a fun experience with a beautiful sense of accomplishment. The game has an awesome mechanic for setting up how the course of the game will play out. The game only gets better when you add more cards with the expansion. My only complaint is the less involved player interaction, but I think its understandable for this type of game. 

Sessons feels like its a very skilled based game. Luck does not really play as a factor. If i lose, its due to my own decision making. If i win, I know its because i played a smart game. The game is simple to learn while having some very nuanced intelligent design. Adaption is key for victory when you are deterministically setting up your seasons. My favorite aspect of the game is the early drafting portion of the game. Developing how your cards come out during the years make your decisions feel so valuable. Your choices mean so much throughout the courses of the game. 

People complain about the theme being pasted on, but I can sense the theme while I play. I imagine myself a wizard in some forest competing for some prowess among the local wizards. At the end of the competition we meet in a pub and share a drink. The sole negative comment I can share is that the game lacks a greater sense of interaction. But that doesn't mean it is not there. The familiars add a good level of take that, but i would have loved to have seen more. Expansions add that sense of greater variety which solidifies this game as a classic on my self. 

Anyways, Seasons is a brilliant game that gives me a warm feeling inside. A relaxed experience with a great sense of complexity. I find myself looking forward to becoming the arch-mage every time I play.

Very easy to learn and amazingly gripping abstract game.  Usually games with abstract themes tend to lose me a bit and I never get into it thematically leaving me a bit detached to the experience.  However, with Seasons, the gameplay carries the game enough where it makes me care about what I'm doing.  Mixing a bit of card handling and dice rolling makes the game a very distinct taste.  The game is nice in the mixture of mechanics from drafting to card play along with resource management and some take that.  Depending if you play with the full card set or the basic allows players of all levels to enjoy the game together.  The smoothness of play and the rare chance of AP locking games makes this a high choice among my games to pull out when I want to have fun.  The amazing art work, unique dice, colorful theme, all rolls into one SUPER VALUE package!  I don't know if there will be other games like it since the mechanics are so varied that it really takes an abstract game like this to pull it off.  Moderation is good, and this game mixes in everything fun about board games with enough moderation to not over do it, and to grab people enough to have them want to play it some more.  Really really good game.  Everyone should have this in their collection.

Lindsay isn't overly fond of this game. At the beginning of the game you have to build a deck from a small selection of cards and messing up which cards you get will pretty much ruin your chances of winning. We've only tried 2-player, so it might be different with more, but it seemed odd to play for so long when the winner was practically decided right at the beginning. That being said, it's an interesting game with nice components and decent gameplay.

基本ドラフトゲームは合わないので辛目の採点。ドラフトゲームは基本カードの特殊効果を選択することから始まるが、それはカードの特殊効果の使いどころがわかる必要があり、それはカード全体でのそのカードの役割がある程度理解できていないとできないこと。そのため、初心者には厳しい。
カードの効果が数値化されている「レースフォーザギャラクシー」と違い、特殊効果。カードの特殊効果が分かればいいが、分かるまでこのゲームに心血注げそうもない。（他のゲームを代わりにプレイしたい）

While a bit fiddly keeping track of all of the triggers that happen in the game, the combination of card drafting, card powers, and dice resources makes this one of my favorite games. By far the best at two, I will play it at higher player counts but my rating corresponds to the 2 player game play.

Gotta love rolling the big chunky colourful dice.  The card drafting at the start is very interesting and given that a lot of points are awarded at the end of the game you often don't know who will win until the end of the game.  The two player game is nice and quick.

I originally played this game on BGA and loved it, and recently received it for Xmas.  In real life the game is even better and I'm surprised this game doesn't get more attention. It is a brilliant mixture of different mechanics - drafting, dice use, resource management and feels different to everything else that we have.  The only criticism I have is that the cubes used for the scoring track, bonus use and the summoning gauge are fiddly and it is easy to knock them off their mark (2.77)

Seasons after just after 5 or 6 plays has shot to the top of the list for me.  I actually enjoy this one more than 7 wonders for 4 people.  The components and art are great, and the game stays fun because of the dice. So fun.

The type of game I want to like more than I do.  After playing thousands of different board games maybe its the lack of theme in this one?  It doesn't come across very well and while I can find fun in the card combos and what not it's maybe too long for not really feeling like it told a story or you accomplished something or whatever else it is that makes a game still enjoyable after you've initially "explored it".  I would rate it higher from a game design standpoint.

After a couple more plays of Seasons, I have to say that I don't find it to be fun at all. It's colorful, but the boards are horribly cramped and the theme adds nothing to the game. There is too much fiddly counting of points on the crystal track, and the game would be much improved by the inclusion of some double-sided tokens to mark the effects of the cards in play. But even this wouldn't fix the downtime, which is ultimately what kills the game for me. In a four-player game this problem renders the game unplayable, in my opinion. I would also have to agree with the reviewer who said that the fundamental way you should be scoring points (by converting energy tokens into crystals, based on the present season) is completely overshadowed by the items and familiars. I am not at all impressed.

Few games, different setups.
Game with some interesting mechanics very well put together, it includes advancing dial of four seasons, card drafting, picking dices with resources and playing cards with special powers, all to get most points in the end of a game. It has very light theme and colorful artwork (but really kind of plain and boring IMO) thereafter may seem like family game, but it actually requires a lot of plannning and knowledge of game to get proper synergies and comboes.

Interesting drafting mechanic coupled with dice rolling to determine your set of actions in a turn. A lot of decision making being had in this game.

Best with 2-3. 4-player games can get sluggish with PA-prone folks and there's little to do during other player turns.
Certain card combos can be very powerful so some games can be quite unfair (somehow remedied by using a modified drafting mechanic).
Best to play with people that know the cards well, to avoid games becoming one-sided.

Sadly the amazing dice could not compensate for poor balance, massive accounting and runaway leader problem (sold).

I have come to the realization that I don't like games with rule-breaker cards that are text heavy.  I am even more displeased by games with text heavy small font cards that sit in front of my opponent that I need to read in order to play effectively.

The game may or may not be bad, but I don't like it.

When you see this game for the first time, you wanna play immediately. Colorful, with great card design...

But then you start playing, you notice how many issues there are with this game :
- First : it's boring. You have fun when it's your turn and you're combotting like crazy. But then it's the others 3 players turn and you have nothing to do except watching them play. The fact that 90% of what they do has no impact on your game makes it even more boring. Just keep track of the 1 or 2 cards that can affect you, and that's all. 
Race makes you play all together to avoid this, Dominion forces you to check the others's actions. Both are fun to play. Seasons does neither of theses things, and is boring.
- Second : It's a game where you can be virtually eliminated, but still be forced to play until the end. When you are losing, chances are that every thing will be even more difficult than you, so you will keep losing. You know you have no way to get back in the game, but the game won't let you go.
- Finally, I'm a bit worried by some of the combinations. Contrary to Race you can play the same card twice. If you happens to get the same "Do this to get X points" card twice (there are 2 of each card), you can easily rack up points by doing the same thing over and over.
There is a reason why Race prevents you from playing the same card twice : it can be abused too easily.

This comment is based on 3 plays (with 2, 3, and 4 players). I was worried after my first play, but I wanted to still give a chance to this game. After playing again and seeing the same issues twice I say stop, it's too much. I tried, but for me the game is broken

The greatest sorcerers of the kingdom have gathered at the heart of the Argos forest, where the legendary tournament of the 12 seasons is taking place. At the end of the three year competition, the new archmage of the kingdom of Xidit will be chosen from among the competitors. Take your place, wizard! Equip your ancestral magical items, summon your most faithful familiars to your side and be ready to face the challenge!

Each player can choose only one die per turn. The die not chosen by anyone determines how many fields the "time track" would move forward.

At the end of the game, the crystals are summed with victory points granted by the cards (minus some penalties, where applicable). The highest score wins.

Great as a 2 player, or 3 player. 4 and up is way to long.

Played several times, 2p, 3p, 4p; beginner version.  Not as good as I had hoped.  This is an extremely tactical game.  In general, you can not plan for what your opponents are going to do, so you must simply make as many points on your turn as you can.  It is fairly easy to stumble into a killer card combo, but, on the other hand, it is also fairly easy to get stuck with non-complementing cards too.  I wonder if the more advanced versions feel more strategic, but they will suffer the fairly common problem of familiarity with the cards will produce a considerable advantage.  The jury is very much still out on this one, but I have not enjoyed the game thus far.

I think the first complaint that everybody said about this game is that some cards are too powerful. It can be true, but if all cards are too powerful, then it does not unbalance the game. Personally, it's not what bothers me most. The worst situation is when a player could play a card from the deck for free and managed to play a 30 point VP card. That simply gave him the game.

The card drafting at the beginning of the game is the most annoying mechanic. How am I going to know the cards I need to have and when I am going to need them. It also slow down dramatically the game at the beginning and it's not fun. Most of the time, I selected my cards randomly. 

Personally, I would have distributed cards randomly, but if you really want to keep the drafting, why not make a 3 card draft at the beginning of each year. It would make much more sense since being in the game, you now know what you need.

Crystallization is also a bit useless, not only it does not give a lot of crystals, but there are cards that gives much more crystals than flushing power. Second, you need to have a die with a circle to be able to crystallize, which makes the action even less attractive. I think I have not crystallized even once through the whole game.

Finally, the lack of first player maker makes it very confusing to keep track of who started to play and some times a player almost had made a double turn. There is also a lot of down time because you need to wait for other players to do their stuff. I managed to accelerate the game a bit by collecting your resources while the others are selecting their dice. Only card play could not be done simultaneously.

RATING: 6
I find the mechanisms of the seasons game clock/timing very interesting as well as transmuting resources based upon changing seasonal values.  The cards are not very well balanced and I find that the person who rolls the "card draw" on their dice has an advantage (during the mid-game onwards).  This is a combination of euro-mechanisms but they don't really fit together thematically.  It essentially is a card game with player mats and seasonal timing board.  (I kind of wish it was more of a board game with cards in it rather than a card game with player boards.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is an interesting, aggressive, combo making card game which throws in a bit of randomness with the dice.  Some of the cards are nasty in a take that flavor while others are so swingy and can score 30 points in one blow with a combo.  Your first play is likely to be painfully slow as you read the card text and figure out possible combos.  Sometimes, some turns wi ll go on forever.  Most likely, this is a game that will fly once everyone has played a couple times.

Seasons is a gorgeous game! I think it's like a lite version of Magic the Gathering (you collect mana and use it to summon creatures and artefacts). Luck is very strong in this game, and I'm not talking about the dice (which are beautiful, by the way), but the fact that a bad hand of cards can take you down, so choosing wisely on the beginning is important. Also, this game is mean, and will have you attacking you opponents as much as you can.

A good game, relatively fast to teach but not that much to play, it can run a bit too long.

It is a nice game, and the contents with the dices and the counters are quite good.

The most importand phase during the game is the beginning when you have to sort your cards to the three years. 

Each card is twice in the box. This is the only thinkg which i do not like. We are playing just with the half of the cards. (50 instaed of 100) than each card is only one in the game.

Mechanics are simple, but it is difficult to know which cards are good the first time you play. Despite dice rolls the drafting mechanic of the dice and cards makes this game's luck not a huge deal; the only huge concern of luck is when you are top decking cards due to other card effects. Lots of cool combos that you can perform, and I feel like all their designs were well thought out; almost every card seems powerful with the right cards to complement them. Game play and viability of certain cards also is really different for different number of players. Interestingly, this game shares a lot of things I don't like about Settlers (decisions early game that can totally mess you up for the rest of the game, not being able to do much for many of your turns), yet my ratings for the two are very different.

The pips of the leftover die may not seem to be very important your first few plays, but managing the clock is extremely important. In fact, at times it can be so powerful that some consider Temporal Boots to be one of the best cards in the game (in fact, I would suggest telling new players that such an item exists so they don't get screwed over by it their first time).

EDIT: After 20 plays this game appears to be a lot less predetermined following the card drafting than I initially thought. Taking the risky draw a card can very drastically affect how you play the rest of the game. At the same time being efficient with having the right energy at the right time can score you a bunch of residual points, which between skilled player can be the difference between victory and defeat. Furthermore, most of the single use cards require good timing to get maximum value. However, this game has taken a lot more effort to shine as I had initially expected, as the initial game without drafting is a lot less fun to me than the future games with. Even then, I prefer playing with the advanced cards too, and so there is an effective 2 game investment when teaching new players.

Seasons will always be a favorite because of the way that it combines drafting and dice. It hits a fairly unique niche, and it was one of the first games that I ever bought expansions for. It's not where I'd go for a dice game or a drafting game, but when I want something relatively easy but complex and fun without much analysis paralysis potential, I'll grab Seasons every time.

UPDATE: Yeah, I'm over it. There are games that do everything I liked about this game better in other ways. And there's a definite learning curve on the cards.

The first and still best board game I had so far. I glad I'd bought it over many other games. There're fixed winning strategy, but the most attractive point of the game is its very good mixing-rate of strategy and luck. And the theme worked so well. The cost is: very text-dependent.

Thanks to this game I knew about Naiiade...

RATING: 8
The heart of the game is that you have 9 cards (we played the preset beginner decks) that you split into 3, representing the cards you will have to play in each of the 3 years that the game spans. You gather energy tokens (4 colors, each related to a season) and increase your ability to summon more cards, all the time trying to score crystals, which are the VP but are also a resource of their own. On your turn, you roll dice according to the current season then each player gets to pick a die, giving them resources. Then you spend them as you are able, to play cards or score points. Hard to grasp at first, it was quite smooth after a couple of turns. Managing your resources is a big part but the card combos - playing them down, getting them to work together - is what will bring players back to this game. I am predisposed to liking this game as card combos and special power card games are right in my wheelhouse, but it was really engaging. Will keep an eye out for another game of this.

RATING: 8
In Seasons, you roll dice to get "manna" to place cards.  You also try to advance on a track that allows you to play more cards.  There is a simple draft on 9 cards that come out three at a time over three years.  The art on the cards is great and the game reminds me of a lighter Magic the Gathering.  

There is a lot of player interaction, however, there may be too much.  The game becomes fiddly because you must remember when some event occurs you or your opponents may gain or lose points based on cards they have played.

This game ought to be family weight but due to the card text and fiddliness, it is not.  But even with all this, it is an excellent game.  You need a few plays though to appreciate the game.

Card Game con aggiunta della parte di Dice Draft.
Le meccaniche ricordano Magic, ogni giocatore sceglie uno dei dadi comuni che si lanciano a inizio turno, i dadi a seconda della faccia permettono di raccogliere energie dei 4 tipi, aumentare il livello di proprie carte in gioco, pescarne di nuove ecc..
Per giocare le carte della mano occorre pagare il relativo costo in energie indicato prendendole da quelle disponibili. Ogni carta ha poi un suo effetto istantaneo, permanente o one-shot.
Ogni X turni avviene un cambio stagione, che fa cambiare anche i dadi lanciati a inizio turno e di conseguenza anche le tipologie di energie prodotte ecc..
E' possibile variare la difficoltà di gioco aggiungendo o rimuovendo determinate carte.

I'd had hopes that [b]Seasons[/b] would be a game that my wife would take to like [b]Carcassonne[/b] or [b]Ascension[/b].  But that just hasn't been the case.  With only nine cards in your starting hand (that come out three at a time), there are a lot of turns where you can't bring any into the game (you just don't have any in hand) and so there's not much to do on those turns.  This "downtime" kills it for her.

These kinds of card games are not usually my jam, but I enjoyed this game. I'm not usually a bit fan of this style of game with all these cards and then all the combos and effects you have to keep in your brain every turn. And there is a bit of player interaction stuff, which usually isn't my thing either. So pretty good game if I was still able to enjoy myself!

I'm also not a massive fan of games for the first play that involve a drafting section that determines base cards for the whole game. And then following that, you need to separate out the cards you drafted into the 3 phases of the game.. so it's pretty easy having never played before to do a bad draft followed by a bad sorting of the cards into the three phases and shoot yourself in the foot before the game 'begins'. Luckily cards seem to work well with each other so you're not totally doomed...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I've only played this w/ 2 players and I enjoy it. The drafting with cards and dice is fun and really makes you think about your choices and the cards you want to play.  Plenty of randomness here but that's not necessarily a bad thing unless you're a pure strategist that dislikes any kind of randomness or unpredictability in your games.  Curious to see how it fares with more than 2 players.

well I liked it I just was a little let down.  I think I wanted it a little deeper or the theme coming through more.  I'd be up for a game of this often but I'm not sure if I will try to buy myself a copy anymore

depth to time ratio is good and it didnt take much time at all to learn. Thats a big plus.  I feel like I could get early gamers o play it, not sure if they would really get into it as much of the game hinges on the drafting at the start.

great art and components

Card drafting with resource management and action selection. Draft a deck of 9 cards, gain 3 of those cards of your choice in each of 3 years. Dice determine actions available every round. Minimal player interaction with base cards, but advanced cards increase this. Plays great with 3 or 4, suffers from zero sum problems in 2 player. Plays in about an hour.

RATING: 8
Inventive illustrations, great components (I want to shake those chunky beautiful dice at my 1Ed Quarriors cripples and scream ‚Why couldn’t you be a bit like THIS!’) and a fantasy theme makes this a possible dream game for me. Reading the rules just increased my interest, although I saw the possibility that the actual game might still disappoint due to unbalanced or uninteresting cards – obviously, these are the lynchpins in this design.

After about ten games, most of them two-player, I’m absolutely not disappointed. We’ve only dipped into the basic set of 30 cards so far, but even without the advanced cards, there is an interesting development in what cards we draft and how we use them during the game. Initially underutilized stuff is now a very hot drafting commodity, and vice versa. An example of the latter is Filgrim, the crystal stealing apprentice, who seemed to be pretty strong until we found various ways to delay crystal scoring well into the 2nd year to hinder his thievery.

If the advanced cards prove to be as well developed as the basic set, my rating of this will certainly increase, and if all players have some games under their belt, this is certainly not just a good game for two. Highly recommended.

12-14-12-played again today, i dare to think we have found the game that might rival Kingdom Builder when it comes to obsession!  I wonder if it will have the replayability that KB has?  We'll find out.  Miles wanted to leave it out to play again tomorrow.  Am bumping this to a 10...

i love how easy this game is to set up, too.

12-13-12-played twice today! First game we just dithered around and halfway thru watched Cat and Mouse review which was very helpful (more helpful than when i had watched it earlier!).  Second game was a real game and we had a good time.  We do think we'll like this one.  Next game we will draft our hands using the first 30 cards rather than using the sets for new players.  Fun! :)

9-19-12-arrived!  Seeing many comments that this plays best with 2 and can really outstay its welcome with 4.  2p under 30 min, 3p-45 and 4p over an hour.

8-15-12-Pre-ordered, due in this month.  Looks mega-interesting.  Dice, cards, combos, gorgeous.  Plays well thru player count (2-4).  Player interaction. 4p game ~ 60 min.

First Impression 7.5

I think it could safely be categorized close to CCGs such as MtG or Yugioh gameplay speaking: you need to collect some kind of resources to play the cards at hand, and once the card is played it have some kind of effect that give you points or affect other players points. What gives this game a nice twist to me is the deck building phase and the limited amount of cards (and the art is pretty nice too).

The game was well received in my gaming group, and more enthusiastically by the youngest (two boys around 12). Surprisingly to me my dad (65+) liked the game quite well.

To address some of the recurrent arguments against this game: 
+ I would say that the game can be played with 3 or even 4 players and be ejoyable, no doubt the last year will get pretty long turns, but anyway with the right group it maintains its fun. 
+ Yes, the game maybe is too long
+ Yes, the score (crystals) track is awful (why so tiny?)
+ I would say that the tracks in the player boards are not the best designed ones, as it is quite easy to knock down the cubes that keep the summoning gauge or the "cheats" count, and is not easy to remember the original position
+ You need to try the game with the building deck phase, as the basic decks won't give you the full picture, but I recommend to play the first game with the basic pre-builded decks

So far we haven't tryed the advanced cards, but I'm hoping to play again soon.

---------------------------------------------------------

Updated: 6.0

I can see where the fun is... but is not for me. Some of the things that don't work for me are:
+ Language barrier: being in a Spanish speaking country where English is not that much common, is hard to get people into playing.
+ Only a 2 player game: I retract about stating that the game can be enjoyable with 3 or even 4, it just drag a lot in the final years and will have huge down-times
+ Not fun interaction: yes, there's player interaction in the game, but for me is not fun interaction. This is not a problem in many games, but in games where the down-time can get quite long, at least I want something interesting to look at.
+ Super long card chains: I think that most people that do love this game is because of this very reason, but me, I don't enjoy it...

Traded away, I hope to a better home where it would get lots of plays!

I'm not usually a fan of "mean" games, but in Seasons it doesn't bother me. I think that's because it feels light and quick, and it doesn't feel like I've struggled to build something only to have another player easily destroy it. Absolutely have to play it with all the cards and drafting. Only play it two player.

One play of the basic (non-introductory) game isn't enough for a proper rating on this one, but ratings are a journey and it's a 6 for now.

Seasons gives you enough rope to hang yourself right out of the gate, in the form of choosing your cards for each year. I made some good and some poor choices, but went last in the first year; my dice didn't let me assemble an engine to make the rest of the game go smoother.

Once I did get some things going, I was far behind with no synergies to look forward to. All around, a frustrating play -- but one where I could see an arc of development, of gaining fluency with the deck and the rhythms of the game, in future plays.

The "learning cliff," for me, left a bit of a sour taste. Particularly as it came on the heels of diving straight into Splender and having a blast right out of the gate, which is generally my preferred type of first-play experience.

Interesting mechanics and beautiful components mask the mediocre game play. I am not a fan of the fact that you see only 20% of the cards in a given game (2 player). I also don't like the whole draft aspect, followed by separating your cards into 3 stacks. I'm half tempted to just deal 9 cards to each player in 3 stacks of 3 and start playing, just to cut down on all the pre-game preparations. However, once the game gets going, I don't mind playing it, so go figure.

So far I have - as of 2013-11-16 - played twice using the intro rules: prebuilt deck, cards 1-30 only. It's taking quite a long time to play because of a lack of familiarity with the cards and strategies. I've enjoyed both games quite a bit and look forward to getting fast enough to add the draft and the new cards.
Added another two plays. You definitely have to figure out how best to develop your hand over the three years - when are you going to play cards and when are you going to Transmute. Is your hand a cards hand or a Transmute hand or a balanced one? Missing out on Summoning Gauge when you need it is really bad. Really. Bad. Next game I think we'll try drafting.
As of 17/01/2014 I have tried both drafting and the additional 20 cards from the base game. I like it, but I'm beginning to feel that there's significant luck elements that I'm not so happy about. For instance, if I draft a card and it's no good to me or even counter-productive, but my opponent draws a brilliant synergistic card, how can my skill counter that? Or, if I roll the Dice of Despair (or indeed, both of them) and never get an improved roll, what's the point? Or if I play crap all game and then draft both copies of the Sceptre of Greatness in year III and those 80 points win me the game, dragging me from last to first, isn't that just luck? Not sure whether it needs way more plays to ensure that the best player wins, or whether it is too subject to luck.

I was originally Turned off by this game's theme.  Now that I have played it, I still don't think much of the theme but I don't care.  the game play is excellent!  A great combination of mechanics makes decision making a real fun challenge.  My only fear is that the cards will get old, but to be fair, I have not even tried the advanced cards yet, let alone the expansion.

Tried learning this game several times watching videos on YouTube and had trouble catching on. Playing it for real was easier. It's going to take some time to learn the effective combos and build that strong engine game to game, but this is game is cool. A lot of moving parts to it. When I'm in the mood for a quieter, strategic game, this is one I would play. I've only played it as a three-player game, and worry that a fourth would add too much time involved to play the game.

We weren't sure at first, but really enjoyed this game! Liked the combination of time passing, the strategy involved in planning ahead, and the unpredictability of the dice.

RATING: 7
We enjoyed our play with preconstructed decks, but I envision the game really shining once players are familiar with all available cards and have some idea of how to chain them together for combos.  This is a game that is fun enough to play but should get a lot better with more experience.  My rating is tentative based on initial impressions and the assumption that it will improve with more experience.

Cast spells based on elemental mana... hmm. Yes, it scratches that Magic itch. With satisfyingly hefty, and pretty, dice rolling. Plays best with 2 or 3. Takes a play or two to be able to make knowledgable choices during the drafting phase. Artwork is pretty, great production values.

At the first time I didn't like the game. It seemed overwhelming and unfair for new players. Actually it is unfair, because in Seasons experience counts. But talking about randomness it is heavelly reduced when you know what to draft and with two experienced players this game might be really strategical and close, loved it!

Well and replayability is so huge, you got 100 cards from whitch you use only 25, and the order actualy matter.

I do enjoy card games like Epic, Magic, VSSystem. But Seasons just added an unnecessary layer with the dice, and the breakdown of the cards by year.

Played with the pre-set cards rather than the drafting system. Not sure a draft could saved this though as it was tedious...

Many games do well with a limited set of cards to the extent that not everyone will get the same cards, however this does not work so Seasons.

Like the Factory & Harbour / Wharf combination in Puerto Rico which is a killer combination, so to these exist in Seasons, get the combination that no one else can match you with & you will win, don't get it & you're just making up the numbers.

I really enjoy the core dice drafting mechanism of this game and the card actions.  Towards the end, there are quite a few cards in play to keep track of so it can become a bit of a burden.  I've also seem games of this go too long due to AP, which is bad since the weight works well with the approximate 60 minute play time but doesn't warrant much more than that.  The excellent components and beautiful, colorful art are also a huge plus.

This is a very good game.  Drafting is required, so one downside is that familiarity is required to get the most of it.  The production is simply outstanding and I adore the art style.

Very different than I expected, and I actually quite lked it.

The game is a near perfect mix of deckbuilding and dice-rolling which makes the game very entertaining with 2-4 players and the best part is that it doesn't take too much of your time.

It is a very beautifully illustrated and well-designed game with quality components. 

While some have their opinion of the game being a bit too random, but since the cards and dice too are actually drafted the game relies on your choices and strategy. 

This is a truly enjoyable game. Highly recommended. 

After 11 games, I'll decrease the score a tad. Still a great game, but luck can sometimes increase the downtime for VERY unlucky players.

surprise stealth hit of 2012 releases.  really like how everything fits together.  not sure the advanced cards are necessary as it can lengthen the game a bit without providing much more in the way of interactivity, etc.

downtime is a bit too much with 4 and 3 seems the best fit.

Nearly a 9, but falls down in the maximum play size of 4.  Just too much down time and confusion when you hit those turns when someone plays 10 cards.  Also - the score tracker is awful.  By the second game, we changed to poker chips.  How anyone uses the provided tracker, especially in the third year when Crystals are being traded back and forth, is beyond me.

With poker chips and a group size of 2 or 3, its a brilliant game.

Draft, play and manipulate cards and dice to be the greatest wizard.

Plays: 8.
Type: VP race = a game where you race to collect victory points (fastest/most). There’s a little bit of progressive efficiency, but not enough to call it a VP engine.
Complexity: Medium. This shouldn’t be the first deck building/card drafting game you play.
# of players: Probably best with 2. Downtime will increase with each player.
Playing time: 30 mins per player for the base game.
Player interaction: Opportunity prevention – drafting of cards and dice. Competition for unlimited resources – power and crystals. Some cards allow light conflict.
Randomness: Medium. The initial card draft and the dice draft during the game are low randomness, but you get more cards from the top of the draw pile during the game that break the symmetry.

Replayability: Average. You won’t get to see all the cards in the deck during one game and every game will feature different card combinations. This means every game will in one sense be unique. However, every game will be pretty samey in how you go about acquiring points. There aren’t wildly diverse strategies. 
Fun: Low. The fun lies in the decision making of hand and board management.
Memorability: Low, it’s a VP race that doesn’t create stories.

Thematic integration: Decent. The art does a good job communicating the theme. It’s still pretty obvious you’re just collecting points though, you never feel like a wizard.
Components: Good and bad. The art is very good and has a unique storybook fantasy feel to it. This is probably the biggest draw of the game and might even have players going “oooh” and “aaah”. For some reason this is complemented with not very functional player boards and basic wooden cubes. With such great art, you feel let down that the same attention clearly did not go into the other components. Cubes on laminated cardboard with tiny numbers just invites ambiguity from the slightest nudge.

Who will like this: Gamers that already own other card drafting or deck building games and want an alternative to play now and then.

RATING: 8.5
A draftolás a 7 Csodát, a kockavezérelt akciók Feldet, a kártyák kombózása pedig a Dominiont juttatta eszembe közben, a mechanizmusok tehát kiváló "donoroktól" lettek koppintva, de ez egyáltalán nem érződik, tökéletesen belesimul a játékmenetbe minden.

Dizájnra is gyönyörű egyébként, aki látta közelről a Lords of Xiditet, annak ismerős lesz (de a kinézeten kívül - hiába készítették ugyanazok - semmi köze nincs hozzá).

Még mielőtt rásülne a bélyeg, hogy több kiváló játék jól működő mechanizmusát gyúrták csak egybe, muszáj megemlítenem az egyedi fordulóváltást: a játékosok által nem választott - megmaradt - kockán szereplő pontok számától függően telik az idő, azaz haladunk előre az évszakok kerekén 1-2, vagy egyszerre akár 3 hónapot is. Remek.

Nem bonyolult, elsőre átlátható, amolyan "light" gamer játék. Annak ellenére, hogy a 7 csodánál bonyolultabb, simán mehetne egyébként a családi kategóriába.

A pontgyűjtés egyébként egészen egyszerű: szerezzünk energiatokeneket a kocka segítségével, amiket beváltva vagy közvetlenül pontot kaphatunk vagy kártyá(ka)t tehetünk le belőlük, amikkel kombózva szintén pontokat kaphatunk. Kb. ennyi.

A játék kiváló, mindenképpen a "muszáj kipróbálni" kategória. Magyar kiadását már évek óta nem kapni, erősen OOP, de akinek nem jelent gondot az angol, megugorhatja a nemzetközi kiadását is (kártyák miatt erősen nyelvfüggő).

És hogy negatívumot is mondjak róla: interakció minimális (néhány kártya van csupán hatással a többi játékosra), illetve jelen van a szerencse is, de ez utóbbi nem jobban, mint a 7 Csodában, vagy mondjuk egy Castles of Burgundy-ban (előbbiben a draft, utóbbiban a kártyavezérelt akciók miatt).

RATING: 6.75
An odd game. The dice are satisfyingly hefty and are appealing. I'm not wild about the artwork, but it's unique and certainly isn't BAD, it's just not quite my style. An awful lot of the game hinges on the initial draft since card drawing opportunities are few and far between. Finding and exploiting synergies in your cards is key here. Detractors says that the draft is the only major decision-making point in the game. I'm not sure I can disagree with that or, if that's true, I'm not whether that makes it a bad game or not. A few plays in I'm finding it pretty fun, more than the sum of its parts.

Fairly cool game of huge dice drafting and normal-sized card playing. I enjoy the drafting at the start of the game, where players choose which cards enter the game in the first, second and third seasons (so they don't all go straight into your hand at the start of the game). The game moves quickly, but maybe too quickly to remember every single instance of "At the end of a round, do x".

I can see why some people like this game but this is just not my coup of tea. "Millions" of cards with unbalanced chaotic abilities. Some good ideas, like the seasons rondel and dice mechanics, a shame they are just accessories in a typical "ameri" fantasy type card game...

One of my favourite games. It's particularly satisfying making a plan and being able to pull it all together in this game. For a game with tonnes of enormous dice it isn't particularly luck driven*, and the dice rolling mechanic is unlike any other (that I'm aware of). 

*Proof: newbies will always get completely trashed.

A nice multi-player experience, wonderfully illustrated (catchy!). Some confusion with the terms (crystals, power...uh?!). It scales down not so well to me - to enjoy it, you have to gather 3+ aspiring wizards; best with 4. 

What [i]exactly[/i] those wizards shall [i]aspire[/i] while playing, it's up to you.

Im Wald der Jahreszeiten treffen sich die großen Magier von Xidit zusammen, um in einem magischen Wettstreit den neuen Erzmagier zu ermitteln. Jeder Spieler verkörpert einen dieser Magier. Seasons (dt. Jahreszeiten) wird über drei (Spiel-)Jahre gespielt und die wechselnden Jahreszeiten sind eine Kernmechanik des Spiels. Die unterschiedlichen jahreszeiten bringen Vor- und Nachteile. Zu Beginn des Spiels draften die Spieler 9 Karten und verteilen diese anschließend auf die drei (Spiel-)Jahre. Nach und nach beschwören die Spieler diese Machtkarten und rufen so mächtige Artefakte oder Verbündete an ihre Seite. Änhlich wie 7 Wonders ist Seasons ein nahezuperfektes Card-Drafting Spiel und kommt bei mir immer mal wieder auf den Tisch. Die vielen Machtkarten erlauben unterschiedlichste Strategien, vor allem mit den beiden Erweiterungen. Seasons spielt sich in jeder Partie erfrischen anders und das hübsch gestaltete Spielmaterial ist klasse!

RATING: 6
Fun little game and I enjoyed the interaction between dice, tokens, cards and points.   I felt the cards' cost vs. power was balanced for the most part and never felt like I was locked into the doldrums of a random-draw pattern matching exercise like some card-drafting games play.  My biggest complaint is with the cards that bump up one person's points while deducting other player's points for inevitable actions, such as at the change of a season, a change of a round, or the play of a card.  A person playing this card needs not invest any more resources into the card while other player cannot do anything to prevent the effect of the card.   The season will pass, the round will end, inevitably you must play a card to compete.  A balance may be to only add points to the one player without deducting points from the others, but I think the game would be tighter overall with this flavor of card entirely removed.

Way better than Dominion and I would try it again

This game feels very "fresh" even though its mechanics are nothing foreign; resource collection/conversion, victory points, die/card drafting. A few possible balance issues with cards, but that is easily house ruled, and this one has very emergent play. Unfortunately, the card distribution can make the game vary wildly in both good and bad ways, as come cards are simply more fun to use. Recommended.

Good game with a touch of 'magic'... (the gathering)
Georgous artwork and some nice combos of cards.
You only play around 8-10 cards by game so it may be a bit frustrating for some players who like to have a hand full of cards. As we play with a limited amount of cards each game is different which adds to replayability.
Luck factor is limited by the draft phase at the begining of the game.

One of the best games I have ever played. The art work is absolutely stunning. The game is relatively easy to learn and is a good gateway game. It is very strategic with a lot of different methods. There is resource management, dice rolling, card drafting, all in an easy to set-up game. It is great for 2 players and good for 3 or 4, too. This game has high replayability. I've literally played hundred of times. The expansions add new mechanics and cards. There are many combos to learns, and learn to improvise!

A combo-oriented card game, like many other LCG or CCG. It combines tactical moves (choosing dice suitable for you and controlling speed of the game) and planning move (drafting cards that work well together) into a very handy game. Other than having to read a lot of cards, the game flows smoothly. A very interesting game that should get a lot of play.

RATING: 7
As wizards, you draft 9 cards like Fairy Tale/7 Wonders. Then you have to group your cards into three for when they will come out in the 3 years of the game.

Every turn, dice are rolled. Players select a die which governs their action: get energy, get VP, increase summoning gauge (number of cards a player can have in play) or draw more cards. Players can also use bonus actions at the cost of losing VPs. The die not chosen governs the speed of the game as you cycle around the year.

This game has good mechanics. I have only played once, and enjoyed my first play. There is a bit of luck in that some cards are more powerful than others. I heard that the sweet spot for this game is 2-3 players, so I'm looking forward to play more games with this number. This is only an initial rating, and may go up with 2 player games.

I like how it has a combination of different mechanics that work well together and seem cool. I also like the art and components style. I wish it was moer like 45 minutes insatead of an hour for what it is. The wizard dueling thing is cool and if its more dynamic in terms of mechanics and components and more fair (not a collectible card game) than Magic the Gathering that's cool too. However I had heard some mixed things though mostly positive so I don't know if I would get this since there are a number of hour long games I'd likely prefer. I definitely want to play it and try it out though.

RATING: 9
Magical themed card game for 2-4 players. Draft 9 cards and play them across three years, with each season yielding differing energy tokens (water, earth, wind and fire). Cards require varying costs of these energy resources to be put into play. Can be a lot of fun. 

PROS:
-Interesting card interactions.
-Multiple paths to victory.
-Each game varies dramatically.
-Requires skill on the go to adapt and respond to what other players do to stop you.
-Great artwork.
-Theme works well, especially the "seasons". 
-Good amount of player interaction despite the card game nature (familiar cards). 
-Players have  a lot of control over the game, being able to influence how fast the seasons progress.
-Time always moves forward at least one spot, so the game has a definite end point (can be prolonged but not indefinitely!).    
-How many cards you can play is limited by a summoning gauge that starts at zero, with the max being 15 cards you can play across the entire game. Very unique. 

CONS:
-Can be too long with four players and becomes a pain to keep track of all card interactions.
-Crystal board is a terrible way to keep track of currency. Its long and tedious and prone to error. Physical crystal tokens should have been provided. 
-Summoning gauge track is very small, should be bigger, possibly with a rotation device or sliding marker. Way too easy to make a mistake. 
-Some cards a little too powerful.
-Some cards very painful, make the game longer and remove some fun. 

Would not readily recommend to another player. To enjoy the game, I made the following changes:
-Add physical crystal currency. You will need x50 1-value crystals, x40 5-value crystals and x10 10-value crystals. Look for acrylic 'vase filler' and 'table scatter'. These do perfectly, are cheap and common wedding/ home decor supplies. 
-Buy both expansions and remove every 2nd copy of all cards, so there is 100% unique cards (i.e. no doubles). With the expansions, the deck is large enough after being cut in half. 
-Remove the following cards entirely: Twist of Fate, Igramul the Banisher, Wonderous Chest, Mesodae's Lantern. Fist two cards became useless because of the modified deck of completely unique cards. Last two cards removed as we found any ability to gain x3 crystals each round too powerful, being a dominant unbeatable strategy. Have also considered removing Arcano Leech and Figrim the Avaricious. These require annoying account keeping and make the game less fun if summoned very early.  

NOTE: Current rating based on the modifications above. Base game without modifications would be a ~8/10 for me. Depends on how much time you want to invest improving the game.

Would probably like more if I played again, but I dislike how the majority of the game is decided already based on what you drafted. The gameplay itself was relatively fine. Dice drafting was neat and dice cool.

Plays: 2

RATING: 5
Awfully underwhelming game.

1. The seasons are not individually important. Rarity of energies found through each are NOT enough to make them of any real consequence. Give us abilities to make one season more desirable than the next...or undesirable.

2. Limited interaction with opponent. It's solitaire, basically. What I do has little bearing on what my opponent does and vice versa.

3. "Transmutation." Why would they not allow players to transmute one energy for another? Why for crystals? They are sparingly used to pay for things and the cards give more victory points in the end...

4. Way too fast game sessions. In two turns, you can pass through three seasons. Again, they are meaningless. Cards are easy to get into play and I've NEVER run into having a hand at the end of the game. Neither has my opponent.

5. It's just not interesting. The card art is fine, but still has a feeling of worthlessness. Some cards are very powerful, while some have no value. Yet, there are duplicates of each one! WHY? My side of the table shouldn't mirror my opponent's. One of each card. THAT'S IT!

6. The upcoming expansion does exactly what I thought it would: add more dumb cards and a "purpose" for the little hole in the character card. Big deal. The game needs its core rules changed, not more awful cards.

7. Speaking of cards, FIFTEEN slots? Come on. May as well be unlimited if you're going to clutter the table with that many.

Played it a bunch of times online before purchasing it and playing it live.

There's a potential lot to keep track of when playing in real life, especially if there's multiple cards with triggered actions, but it is fun nonetheless.

Update 1:  There's a couple of things that bother me about that have prevented me from bringing it out more often.

- There's a lot to keep track of when your plauteau of cards gets bigger and bigger.

- Art is beautiful but graphic design could've been better.  There's several cards with a ton of text that feels like they are paste-ups as the text runs longer than the centered space for it.  

- Drafting at beginning of game clearly sets the difference between experts and newbies.  There's no way for newbies to draft well in their first games, thus setting themselves up for an unfavorable position for the rest of the game.

-  Game is really meant for 2 players as it runs long and there's a lot of stuff going on to keep track of.

I think I have better games for any amount of players this offers and I'm only really keeping it because the artwork and dice are fantastic.  

Well, I can always go play it at boardgamearena and be finished much faster than in a real tabletop game.

Each time I've had this game on the table people walking by ask about it.  Unfortunately, there is no succinct way to describe it.  There are so many different mechanics thrown in that it likens to several games while being distinct from them all.  It has a drafting mechanic for on the fly deck building.  It has a dice rolling and selection mechanic.  It has a resource management mechanic.  It has card chaining.  This is definitely a game for gamers.  So far I have only played with the base set of cards, and I'm excited to see what the advanced cards will do to keep the game interesting.

The card drafting mechanics need to be adjusted (just create your own rules) as you feel like being "stuck" with potentially bad cards for the rest of the game. Nonetheless, this is a well-rounded game with great artwork.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Dice selection for resources coupled with card drafting and reserving make for a long term strategy winner but what's fun, clever and fresh also increases luck swings because drawing cards is rare but valuable, cards are often designed to fit the pregame mechanic (having relative effectiveness depending on the year) and the price to put good cards in play can be undervalued, depending on cards already in play.

RATING: 5
The dice drafting mechanic is the only interesting thing about Seasons. The art is nice, but does nothing to create immersion in a non-existent 'wizard's duel' theme. As the game progresses each player has to keep track of an increasing number of conditions in which their Power cards trigger.

Each season is split into 4 seasons with each season having a different set of die to determine the energy people can choose for the round.  Summoning stars determine how many cards you may have in front of you in play.  

The game actually does remind me a bit of Magic the Gathering.  I love that they give you some 'starter decks' instead of using the drafting method to make your three decks.  Towards the end of the game there is quite a bit going on and coming up with a great way to maximize your points by using cards and selling energy is just brain burn-ey enough to remain fun, challenging, and rewarding.

I love the drafting mechanic in this game. It make you plan out your whole game at the beginning, which you still have to modify from time to time to deal with your opponents choice of cards. Love the artwork on the cards and the nice combos you can make with them. Must have game for any MTG players.

A big buzz at GenCon and I did like it, though my first play was with 4 players and I'll not play that way again. I can see this being very good with 2 players and you just can't get away with how awesome and chunky the dice are.

RATING: 7.5
A lot of seeming asymmetry begs the question of whether this game is balanced (or even remotely balanced). There is almost a "We Didn't Playtest This" flavor to it, in that you can effectively draw the "I Win" card, with all your opponents agreeing that you're going to crush them all, only it could take another 90 minutes more before you actually win. There are a bit too many things to take care of, to the extent that you can easily forget things that are due you or others, especially if you have cards that confer bonuses on changes of season alongside multi-use cards. Nevertheless, Seasons has novelty value and can be a pleasure to play.

RATING: 7
Seasons is a solid enough game that'll warrant the number of plays it'll take to get really good at it... but for the same reasons, I don't think I need to get a copy.  It's this year's 7 Wonders.

Expect LOTS of card expansions (and possibly dice as well).  Expect cries of randomness to increase as you take off the training wheels; it's swingy as HELL.

I really enjoy this game and wish I could get it to the table more often.  I love the components, especially the dice.  The cards add a great variety to each game and game strategy.

It plays really smoothly as well.  I also think it's fairly easy to teach (especially for a euro game) but has a great level of strategy once you understand how to select and organize your cards.

RATING: 7.5
The production is fantastic, the graphic design is outstading, even for the usual French high standards. Everything inside and outside looks great. 

It's a game about drafting cards, then getting resources to play these cards and comboing them. The combos are powerful and they seem able to create big differences. The gameflow is fast, but there's downtime and the last turns are quite longer.

There's a bit of luck involved, but the draft and selection of cards minimize it and make the learning curve steep. Once the cards are drafted, the strategic part doesn't seem to be deep, but there will be many tactic considerations when choosing the dice and ocasionally drawing more cards and adapting your strategy.

Overall, I found it to be very very fun. I think it excels at 2 players and handles 3 players, but 4-player games should be avoided.

The components are of good quality, thick cardboard, chunky fun dice, nice and funny art. Despite the funny art, the game can get quite deep strategywise. I guess it's a great game if you play with the same crew often enough, but if your boardgame group setup changes most of the time, then the players who played this game more often will probably easily beat the others, due to their better understanding of the more subtle mechanics.

RATING: 7
Drafting, dice selection, and huge power combos. The drafting part is essential in making the rest of the game interesting. Individual turns are very quick but the game still manages to be about one third too long. 

Card descriptions in the rulebook are inadequate, failing to address many common gameplay situations.

User interface issues:
- The scoreboard is totally useless, and there isn't any excuse for this, since there is lots of room left in the box. 
- Tiny font on the cards.
- Needlessly confusing terminology.
- Since fire mana is not red, mana types get confused with each other all the time.
+ They did have the sense to make the cards MtG-sized this time, though. The box insert also has enough room to hold sleeved cards.

As of November 2013, this is one of the best games I've ever played.  It has beautiful components and artwork, great mechanics, and is actually incredibly simple.  This game looks intimidating to some, but it is incredibly simple to play and involves a lot of forward-thinking-strategy.

My girl, who isn't much of a gamer, loves this game.  She loves it win or lose.  So if you have those people who you want to sit down and enjoy a game with, this seems to be that game (I actually bought this because people said it played great with 2 players and that their girl's also loved it).

The game has card drafting at the start of the game and players prepare starter hands for the 3 year tournament.  Each turn a player rolls the dice and each player takes turns choosing a die.  And then each player takes turn playing cards from their hand that they can afford.

The mechanics work smoothly and most times I play, the others want to keep playing!

Gioco di carte che necessita di un po' di partite per padroneggiare i poteri descritti, il draft iniziale rende ancora più determinante la conoscenza delle carte nel mazzo. Le meccaniche di contro sono semplici e il gioco risulta quindi molto apprezzato e facilmente giocabile. Dadi e pesca delle carte rendono comunque il gioco soggetto alla fortuna.

RATING: 6
Not a bad game but not my cup of tea so this one got traded. Didn't live up to the hype. Too much information to keep track of on all the cards. Some of the cards may be too over-powered, especially since there's no way to counter someone when they get lucky and draw a very powerful card. I really liked the season wheel and dice drafting aspects though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a Euro game, no question, which is probably why I enjoy it as much as I do. As such, mechanically speaking, it's brilliant. It also looks thematic, but once inside the player will discover that quite a few of the beautifully illustrated cards have quirky names and lovely pictures that have nothing to do with what they actually accomplish when played. For example, why does "summoning" Lewis Greyface (a white rabbit who holds a wooden club menacingly behind his back as if he's about to secretly attack) allow me to copy but not steal my opponent's energy tokens? Why (thematically, not mechanically) does the Die of Malice give me two crystals every time I use it? etc. etc. In other words, for a game that looks so vividly thematic, it may be a bit of a letdown for some to discover that it's all actually a facade, an extremely thin coat of paint for a mechanically solid game. It was for me at least.

First of all: beautiful artwork, nice dice and a great box, where everything has its place.
Drafting mechanic of both, cards but even more the dice is really fun and interesting. A big plus for me (and also why the rating has increased) is that really different strategies seem to be possible.
The card drafting aspect and some of the cards give a nice level of interaction.

The game really shines with 2 players for me, 3 can also be still fine if all 3 sort of know what to do, with 4 the downtime just becomes a little too much, even with experienced players.

Too much like Magic.  Land (mana) are the dice which are rerolled each turn.  No monsters but have spells, artifacts, and familiars.  Instead of knocking down your opponents health you build up crystals (life).  Most crystals after 3 full cycles is the winner.

Interesting in that the dice change over the 4 seasons of the year.  But just an ok game.  I'd rather just bring out my old Magic cards and play that.  Though in the grand scheme of things Seasons is a whole lot cheaper.

[i]Really enjoyed playing this, probably the game that has come the closest to giving my the Magic: The Gathering experience in a non collectible format. The only reason I don't own it is because this game is the very definition of fiddly, there are so many things to keep track of that it is way too easy to forget something which could end up giving your opponent the game. Also it has the worst score track I've seen.[/i]

RATING: 7.5
This feels like Magic the gathering Lite. My biggest gripe with this game is the lack of control in drawing cards. I often found myself emptying my entire hand well before the next year could begin. The cards are what make this game of course. And you want more of them to experience the interactions they provide. Perhaps the dice we were getting just didn't have the draw card icon on them as frequently as they might. My wife loves this game though. And it is deep enough to keep me interested as well. But I think it will suffer some replayablity issues unless some expansions with lots more cards are added. 11/18/14: Played again and this time the dice did offer more card drawing and I was just barely able to empty my hand before the game ends, and that was only with the use of the very powerful "Tree of Life Card" that let me convert points into resources. Wife lamented that she did not have the right sort of mentality to play this game, even though she came out of the gate like gangbusters and I thought she played really well. We have yet to try the draft mechanic that probably adds a ton of interesting aspects to the game.

Some interesting stuff going on here. I like how the dice draft works each turn - roll and each player takes one in turn, the one left over determines how fast the game clock advacnces. The set of dice used change each turn, or each other turn depending on how fast the clock goes, and each set offers different resources, so as the seasons change the likelihood of collecting each resource type alters. You spend the resources to get your cards out, which provide either one-off or ongoing benefits. And before the game starts, you choose which 3 cards you'll be able to build in year 1, which 3 in year 2 and which 3 in year 3, providing some game-start planning. Haven't done the drafting yet a la 7 Wonders style, but that will be some pretty hefty pre-game gaming right there. Once you got going, turns were at a decent speed, as your cards don't change that much. Choose your die, get your resource, spend it if you can to get a card out. There's a die option to get more cards, so you're not limited to what you start with. There's obviously a fair bit of replay here given all the sorts of decks you can build, seeing how they work out, balancing resources vs effects. Easily worthy of more exploration.

What I like:
- Colorful; chunky dice
- Clever dice and season mechanisms

What I don't like:
- Was far more attacky/leachy than I expected
- 2+ hours for a 3p learning game was WAAAAY too long
- Way more effects and actions than I enjoy tracking
- Very dull ending, with no cards played in the last 5 turns or so

This game deserves to last about 30 minutes, not 2+ hours. I was told this was a "friendly" game with minimal interaction, but a lot of the familiars were quite annoying, and several were pretty nasty.

The BGG-voted weight of 2.8 seems about right to me.

Liking this one more and more after a few online plays.  It does take a few games to really grok it, though.  Also, I think best as a 2-player game.

SOLD March, 2015: Never could get this to the table, and Chad owns it anyway.  If I ever do play again, it would be with him, but I think it will be rare if we choose to play: the cards take a few games to learn and are not so intuitive to use.  And I can play online if I really get the urge.

There's a lot of cool stuff happening in Seasons. However, it seems like it would really benefit by repeat plays and by playing with others at the same amount of knowledge of the game. I have so many games now, that it would be hard to get this to the table often enough with the same people to make it really hum. There are also some card combinations that introduce potentially huge swings in the game that seem super broken and luck-based.

RATING: 6
Based on one play: You draft 9 cards (or select a preset deck for first time players) and then based on where you are in the turn (the season) you roll dice and have to select one and pass the others. The dice give you mana to play your cards, points and increase the number of cards you can play. The interactions between the cards is lighter than most games of the genre, but still advantage those who know the game. Worth a try, but not really my type of game.

Despite the fact that I enjoy card drafting and trying to set up card combos, this game came up short for me.  The cards in this game rarely interacted with each other, they were usually either good or not, so they didn't really help players have differentiated strategies.  Addtionally, some of them were vicious and not that fun.  I thought the dice-drafting system would be clever, but instead it would inevitably create a shortage of something, making some symbols worth more to everyone.  It was disappointing to see entire turns where a player (or players) could literally do nothing on their turn but pass.  It's cute, and the artwork is fantastic, but in the end there's just not much of a game here.

Although I won my only play, I did not enjoy this at all;  For the first few turns, I was unable to do much due to the rolls (not enough stars or something);  The other players said this wasn't a problem & sure enough I won.  However, if you can be successful without doing anything, I think that tells you all you need to know about the game.

First game of this kind of sucked. Jen didn't shuffle the cards very well and we basically ended up with mostly doubles of the high numbered cards. I gave it another pile shuffle for the second game and it played out much, much better. The components are really nice but they bow slightly which causes them to spin when you have to adjust any numbers of your player board or put tokens near it.

Fun game, really can't wait to play it more.

A card game with excellent replayability. I like very much the card-drafting prelude phase and the dice-drafting in the tournament. This game has definitely a luck factor, but in the long run the skilled players are rewarded.

I'm mixed on this game.  It's been on my radar for quite awhile and I was very interested in it.  I love its theme, card comboing, dice rolling, and actions to perform.  It's fairly easy to learn its rules.

This game isn't forgiving for newbies.  The starting cards to divide up to the three years can cost player if they don't know how easy or difficult they can come out and their power.

My main issue is that there is a wide difference in the cards' powers, with some being very overpowered.  One person got to build a free thirty point card while I had the same card and had to build it for 20 crystals, which rubbed me the wrong way.  The dice provide additional card draws, however overall card draws seemed very light.

Our four player game took a lot longer than what it felt like it should have taken.  You'd think its limited time track should have expired quicker.

I definitely want to play this again to see how the card strengths mitigate out, however overall I was disappointed.

3/11/13 - I thought this game got better with plays but now that I've played a ton of games online, I'm burnt out on it. It's still fun but I'm kind of over it. I will bump it to a 7 for now.

Drafting is interesting in that you have to set up an early and late game strategy for yourself in the first ten minutes, and then the rest of the hour is spent drafting dice to assist you in getting cards out onto the board.

I still don't know if I even like this game or not, but I'm obsessed with trying to figure out what strategies are most viable and which cards are worth drafting over others.

Played this on BGA. First impression is pleasant. As people say, this game does scratch the MtG itch without scaring away the girlfriend. It needs a few plays to get to know the cards better in order to play it better. I can see the drafting mechanics being good in this game. It will offer more strategy to the game. Even though it is based on dice rolls, but the players take turns to draft a die from the roll so it offers a bit of strategy than just blind luck. There are items in the deck that helps to re-roll if necessary as well. I can see this game gets a little bit fiddly if I do play a physical copy. For now it will stay on my to play list on BGA.

Took a while to pull the trigger on this one but picked it up in a trade. Really enjoyed the first play with the beginning set up. Looking forward to trying it with drafting.

[Update] Played a few more games and added drafting mechanic. This is actually quite a lot of fun. It can be difficult to get what you want when you want it, but you still feel like you could carry out your plan. (Although that doesn't always mean you win!)

I find the cards a little too disparate in power.  Although there is a draft, there's really no excuse for cards to be basically worthless in all circumstances.  I haven't played it enough to be sure, but it's also possible the game is over once the draft is complete.

Card draft (and sorting), dice rolling/drafting, leading to tournament rounds (combo payout). Feel of a MtG style summoners duel. More streamlined in online play. Really engaging components and artwork.
-Certainly quite a 'take-that' dueling actions; not direct destruction, but constant poking the other player(s) is a frequent action. Familiarity/experience with card combos a huge plus; the whole first phase of drafting the cards for the 3 years can be really overwhelming to new players.

I liked this far less than I hoped I would.  The art and components are great...beautiful, even.  The game itself is fun to play, as well.  Where it suffers is in book-keeping.  Crystals, summoning levels, card effects (collect a crystal from each player, add to yours every time you enter a new season; add three crystals if you have four energy at the end of each round, etc. etc.)...I feel like it needs an app to keep track of one or more of these things.  But then, if you need an app to play the game, why not just play an app version of the game, right?  
It isn't that I don't like Seasons, I just wish it was less fiddly, and could be played a bit more casually.

Thank you Secret Santa 2012!!
Finding some elements of Seasons that aren't thrilling me. I think familiarity with the cards will help over time but right now not really digging the randomness of the draft or dice. I don't have a problem with dice games but there is an extreme feeling of limitation in the available actions. I had a really fun game where I was able to draft a selection of synergistic cards. There was a lot of tension. It was great. My next game was a stinker though, with cards that conflicted or necessitated using a strategy that required sacrificing all my familiars. It's a weak 7 for me right now. I'll update after a few more plays. 

EDIT: Well, hubby and I resolved our dissatisfaction with the draft by adding four more cards to the draft (we still keep 9 each). Some purists might poo poo that idea but I like that it gives just a little more room to piece together a strategy. Seasons has become a fun game to play now and I elevate my rating to a solid 8.

A strategic engine-building game with enough variation to keep it from getting stale. I like the drafting for cards to start the game, as you can really build up some powerful combos for yourself later in the game and get an idea of what other people might be doing based on what cards get drafted before you see that hand again. The dice-rolled options make sure you can't pursue a single strategy that you plan from the beginning, since you have to roll with what you're given to some degree.

There's not a whole lot of interaction, but there is some.

I liked the art work and and the dice drafting looked interesting, but didn't seem to do much. The game seems to be mostly about putting together card combos and resource management behind it so you can play cards. I won't play enough to really learn the card combos so I'll always be missing the most interesting part.

Theme? there's a theme, other than 4 seasons?
It tries to blend to many mechanics that it just misses with me. 

Played with four - probably better with less players. Wouldn't mind playing again but have no desire to purchase.

This should be much better than it actually is, but it's really only fun for the guy that has Temporal Boots to "surprise" everyone with a sudden game ending.  But, even without that, playing last on the last turn of the game is a stellar advantage.  Oh and by the way, add a way to randomly luck into 30 points, which is about 20% of a winning score.  Since the card draft is basically the whole game, why not play a game where the card draft really is the whole game (7 wonders, Fairy Tale) instead of one where the card draft is followed by 90 minutes of nothing?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Medium-weight combo-building card game that mixes up an amazing artwork, stunning production quality and dice/energy/transmutation mechanics that blend in with the game nicely. The draft system makes you play with what you have on hand/table, as opposed to building your strategy on "what will/may come". This shifts the weight towards metagame during the draft, but it doesn't take long and introduces few interesting options - you can deduce some of your opponent's cards and you can deny some.

Hands down, one of the best games of 2012. Several ways of achieving the victory. Keep in mind that it's not M:tG or Netrunner and it's meant for slightly different crowd. You can get anyone to learn Seasons quickly and play it with you. Hardcore gamers that seek mind-melting deckbuild challenge will min/max it too quickly and whine about randomness. Others will have great fun with it.

The only complaint I have is a bit too little player interaction. There are cards that can provide that (some pretty ingenious!), but it usually doesn't feel like it really changes things score-wise. I'd love to see more take mana/crystals cards and direct opponent's table interaction (steal cards, decrease counters, and whatnot). 

And, oh, the box insert is a masterpiece and conquered my heart. Every game producer should follow this.

This is my "favorite game that nobody ever wants to play". It's too heavy as an introduction for new players, and more experienced players generally just want to play something else instead. It also functions better as a 2-player game than at 3-4, which limits its use at game nights.

Pros:
* Lovely art and great production quality.
* Pretty quick setup.
* Excellent box insert. Even fits sleeved cards!

Cons:
* Need to learn the cards well in order to really play "Phase 1" (drafting).
* Too many moving parts and things to remember (fiddly).
* While scores are mostly open, there's just too damn much to count up to really know how you're doing.
* No interesting player interaction (at least not in the first 30 cards). The draft might count as interaction, but only if you know the cards well enough to do hate drafting [UPDATE: Based on Rahdo's comments, it sounds like there are a lot of "attacky" cards available so perhaps there's more interaction in the advanced cards]

= 2013-07-07 - R:4, Adding to Trade list.

First play. 2 player. Used "Apprentice" (no draft) starter rules.

Underwhelmed. Based on the games we've rated highly, I think it's fair to say we prefer more abstract games with a lot less text on the cards and a lot fewer combos. We actually *like* combos in games like Dominion (which we disliked for other reasons), Blue Moon City and Babel or chain reactions like you get in Gheos and Kahuna, but those games do it with a much smaller number of different cards. I suspect if you could refer to a game as "MtG: The Board Game" we're probably not going to like it.

By midgame, it was getting annoying keeping up with all the persistent effects cards and the collecting of necessary energy just felt like drudgery.

Towards the end of the game we were purposefully leaving the die with the most pips on it behind just to make the game end sooner.

At almost no point in the game did I care what the other person was doing. Sometimes she would sacrifice an energy to cost me 4 points, but I couldn't make myself care. She may as well have been moving values around in my spreadsheet.

Boring. Fiddly. Tedious.

I'm giving this one a 4, but I'm also admitting this it likely an excellent game for people who like MtG style combos, drafting or victory point engines.

A very solid game, with great production quality. It is a drawback of this game that one might pass some turns impotently while one lacks the resources to play the cards in hand, or lacks cards altogether.  Our first play wound up so close that I really regretted not being able to do anything to improve my likelihood of taking an action. Otherwise, after a few turns, this game is really approachable, and does a lot to remedy the problems of typical deckbuilding and card drafting games.

RATING: 7
Enjoyable, relaxed game for two. It's beautiful, it has quite a few meaningful choices (although mostly during the draft phase), it can be tense depending on the cards drafted. If you love dice and cards, "Seasons" provides both in spades. Thanks to the way the cards work, there are many interesting combinations and after almost twenty plays I still discover new ways to utilize my hand.

However, if you want to enjoy this game, you need to accept the randomness - randomness that can sometimes cost you the game (or win you one). The draft phase works well to partially balance things, but the cards you draw during play are just pure luck. Sometimes you will get something that will dramatically change the outcome and there is no way to protect yourself if you're on the wrong end of the stick. Be warned!

Other than that, really fun, loveable game.

Played quite a lot during the summer, it is quite portable, and also playable on a beach. 
The draft before the actual game defines 90% of the card pool you have to work with durinng the game, and sorting these into three groups of three (two groups become available only later in the game) presents also interesting decisions, which will have a direct effect, how you build up your engine during the game. 
The players are always throwing one more dice than the number of players and then choose one from this pool in turn order. The pips on the remaining dice dictates the speed of the game, which is quite interesting, since the changing seasons define the scarcity and the availability of the resources. 
Overall the game hase exceptionally beautyful components, chunky big dices, and the illustrations on the cards - albeit anime-style - are beautyful. But still the game feels a bit shallow. There is a small amount of take that, but it is on an acceptable level. 
I would play it under the right circumstances, and due to its portability and weight it remains in my collcection. 
Worth to mention, that it is a good 2-player game, with more the AP could be a significant drawback.

I have a love/hate relationship with Seasons. I love it because individually, each of the mechanics and cards are fantastic. Drafting dice and cards, the lovely artwork, etc. All great! That being said, I'm just not convinced the game is entirely balanced. In the future I may take out certain cards from the deck to ensure a more even distribution of abilities. The orange cards especially seem to wreak a nasty kind of havoc on players, not to mention slow down the game with constant micro-managing of crystals.

Overall: I really want to love this game. There's so many good things to note, but for my game group's personal play style it may require tweaking.

Great feeling when playing this game.  It's on my top 10 list to stay.  A complete pleasure to play.  The three major mechanisms (card draft at beginning, dice rolling/selection, and putting cards in play...developing combos) are all well done and all work well together.

Sure, it's a little fiddly in the final year when you get out lots of cards that interact with each other, but it's not overly difficult to keep everything organized.

At least a few times in each game you'll hear:  "WAIT!! I was supposed to......" and then you have to decide if it's too late, or the adjustment will be allowed.
The terminology:  collect 'energy' to turn it into 'crystals' is not at all confusing (as some reviews would lead you to believe).

I also got some 'crystals' at Goodwill that we use instead of the fiddly scoreboard.  It has enhanced the game for us.  Cards that involve giving crystals to other players are somehow more fun as you physically slide the crystals across the table....rather than 'adjust' the scoreboard.  Here's a link to the thread where photos are posted of the physical crystals: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/16815039#16815039

Great game.  Recommended.  I have not tried it 4P, but it works great 2P or 3P.  I think 4P would be too long....with too much downtime.

A good implementation at BoardGameArena gives a great feeling for the game...and it's kinda nice to have it do the accounting, so you don't forget stuff (at change of season, etc...)

A pleasant surprise. Although this kind of games are not up my alley, I still enjoyed playing it. It also that I won :) Trying to figure out the best combos is fun and addictive and it is flexible enough for you to change strategy or keep things open. I found it to be very luck driven but you have to accept that as part of the game. Thematically very solid with the seasons theme and the passing of, well, the seasons. Nice touches like how you go forward and an element being predominant in each season. Altogether a good game.

I can understand why people would enjoy this game.  It's got some interesting card combos and could be very competitive once you fully understand the system and all the cards.  I'm not willing to invest my time and effort into playing a game like this - or any game where you have to invest in a system (think MTG, Android: Netrunner, X-Wing: Miniatures, etc).

As a new player this game is going to be rough for you.  If you are playing against an experienced player you are probably not going to enjoy it.  It's definitely one you'd need to stick with for the long run to get any satisfaction out of it.  You're going to need to understand what every card does, what every combo is, which tactics work, etc.

There are so many other games I'd rather play than this.  My rating is quite low because I don't ever want to play this game again and I did not enjoy my experience with this game.  I can, however, understand how others enjoy this game.

Lots of fun if you don't over analyze the cards and stall the game. Game changes nicely from building up capabilities, then playing opportunities, and finally scrambling to play your cards. Game was a lot more intuitive than we expected.

Played via Boardgamearena.com

My impressions on my initial game of Seasons differed from the initial drafting at the beginning of the game to actual play i.e. choosing a die and taking any appropriate actions. I greatly enjoyed the drafting and trying to achieve synergies between the different card choices. The actual play felt rather flat because there is minimal interaction, and minimal interesting decisions. 

The initial detraction is that the theme is pasted on; this is no different than many other Euro games. I felt a disconnect from the initial drafting (and lovely artwork) to the actual game play in choosing a die and taking appropriate actions. Any interesting decisions were taken at the start of the game, and game-play was actually waiting to be able to take an action. 

My main bone of contention is that unlike a deck construction or drafting game, where you are receiving cards as you play, in Seasons all the decisions are largely made upfront, and you are using actions from the die to implement your strategy based upon the initial draft. However, unlike a deck construction game in which you are interacting with your opponent, there is no real interaction in Seasons.

Crystals are also given out like candy, leading to a points salad type experience.

Playing face to face may be better because the components (from reviews) look gorgeous, and the die are large, chunky and colourful providing a tactile experience. Also, the game plays quite fast, and I would estimate 45 mins to an hour face to face.

I like the weight and length of Seasons.  It reminds me of Kingsburg those terms, but perhaps a little more weighty - which is good.

The game looks pretty and moves along nicely.  We'll see how it fares after many plays.  For now, it's a good choice for my wife and I as it seems to fit in the sweet spot (in terms of time, strategy, interaction, luck) that Race for the Galaxy, Kingsburg, and Age of Empires III hits.  It will likely get played a lot.

RATING: 9.65
Interesting mix of mechanics.   Really a strategic game that has a damage control by tactics feel which is up my ally.  With two players the random dice set-up along with the vast variety of card combos really  makes this one feel different from game to game. However, it's one of those games that really needs some plays to "get it" especially since there is a draft mechanism at the start. Overall, Great fun just trying to get as many points a possible and trying to stay on target  but man there are some real swings in this game that makes it hard to predict at the end.  My biggest downer on this game is that the theme is thin as I wish I really could feel what I'm building.  However, i feel the same with Dominion which I really enjoy so in my opinion the game play makes up for its lack of thematic depth.  Playing with the advanced cards can have some real cutthroat moments.  Some of the cards are just nasty.

Terrific little game.  Graphics may be a little more my 10 year-old's speed, but it's a nice mess of drafting/card management/energy management/dice in a tight little package.  Not super-deep or revolutionary but it's definitely fun.  And easy to teach/learn.

Big advice: Don't pay attention to the rulebook's suggestion of playing a first game with no drafting and a pre-determined deck made up of the easier cards.  Just shuffle them all together and start with the draft.  

Oct. '12:  Cool litte game but after buying it at GenCon a couple months ago it's pretty much just sat on the shelf. I think it'll become just a 2-player game and there are a bunch of them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Honestly one of the most broken card games I've ever played.  It's sad that it took 2 expansions to fix the issues that the overpowered/underpowered cards and bad dice rolls cause.  It can be fun but some cards need to be removed and dealt at random instead of drafting.

Both Lauraine and I, enjoyed playing this as its different enough to other games we already own.
Most post here suggest its best as a two player game and that will suite us just fine.  

The aim of the game is to collect crystals, using a combination of dice rolls and card drafting.

RATING: 7
So far I've not managed to play this much - one 4-player and a handful of 2-player games, the last probably as far back as 2013, all using the predefined card sets given in the rulebook (no drafting). While the game seemed initially to go down well enough (the 2 player games more so), the lack of further plays shows that my wife and I, and the rest of our regular gaming group, don't exactly love it. Personally, I don't think this game looks like being a classic, but it certainly seems to be fun, and I'd definitely like to play it with the proper drafting rules. (The only reason we haven't is that my wife doesn't want to without knowing the cards better, and we don't play often enough to allow this to happen.) But it seems clear now that we never will. Good game, and extremely pretty, but I don't find it compelling either.

This is a cool little game. I have a feeling it is the type of game that gets better with more plays. Early games are all about learning the cards and their possible combos with other cards. The Season circle with constantly varying rarity/value of energy resources is a very unique, interesting feature and not just a gimmick. I'll be interested to see if my opinion changes if I can get it to the table more.

(+) Nice artwork

(-) A lot of text on the cards. It takes time to absorb all this information if you play the game for the first time. This results in quite a bit downtime if new players join the game
(-) With all the text on the cards it can be hard to keep track of special abilities your opponents can activate

Easily one of my top 5 games. Seasons has rich replayability with all of the different card combinations and even with about 15 plays I'm still just starting to uncover some of the deeper strategies of this gem. The expansion only makes it better by adding even more variety and replayability. Highly recommended for fans of cards, dice, and really amazing Disney art.

Theme is not super there, but the art is incredible and really draws you into the game world.

RATING: 7.2
Love love love the system.  Hate Hate Hate most of the content.  This game is extremely slippery slope, which is fine in a game as long as it a) ends quickly  or b) allows the losing player to shoot the moon with an alternate win condition.  Unfortunately neither of these things exist in Seasons.  You are forced to play the game for an additional 10-15 minutes after you've lost.   The worst part is the number of spells that allow you to cripple your opponent in some fashion.  By the end of my first game, any action I took would result in a net loss for me.   I had all of these abilities, but could not use ANY of them.   While I agree that this just means I drafted poorly, the fact still remains that the game is unfun if I am not even able to play any of my abilities.

I went in with hesitance,
after a few rounds I loved it,
by the end of the game I hated it.

"Ok, so you are getting 1 energy for your turn?  Ok so that means I get 3 VPs because of upgrade X, you lose a 2 VPs because of upgrade Y, and I get 5 more VPs at the end of every one of your turns because of all this other crap I got."

I also agree with the overall thoughts on the length.  The game's story arc is similar to Magic the Gathering, but it's 3-4 X the length.  I think 1/3 of the length could be shaved off easily, and it would be a lot more enjoyable.

Another option would be to simply have the game end after a certain point differential.  IE: if a player has 50 points more than his opponent on the board at any point, he wins instantly.

in the deep past, my bane was win-hungry jerks teaching half the game and then winning due to a rule they forgot to mention. years later, i avoided games full of tiny text on cards that might or might not suddenly and drastically change the game state. more recently, i just don't see the point in bothering to get briefly familiar with a card-text-driven game when we'll probably only play it once. as such, i'd avoided Seasons. after having played... well, i see why it's a classic. and, i suppose the card draft helps mitigate some of the wondering what's in my opponent's hand (although there's still a ton of reading cards that may crush or or might only crumple). it was fun, but not really a game i want to own and bring out with non-gamers, although i have seen it magically work before (maybe they played Magic?). it's heavier than 7 Wonders, but less instantly accessible. i might rather play this than Ethnos, but not Race for the Galaxy.

Excellent game for 2p. 3p and 4p are too long.

Highly recommend this game for anyone who likes card games, but doesn't like the competitive nature of them. Personally, I find Seasons to be a fun, VERY well designed game, with not a ton of nasty things one can do to opponents. Honestly every time I play Seasons I love it even more. Its really thinking about the best possible way to go about your turn, and since the negative interactions with other players are so rare, they really affect the game play. Love it! Would give this a ten if there were more interactions with other players like other card games typically showcase.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Great game with great artwork and great mechanics. It has a lot of interlocking and well though-out systems that tie together seamlessly. Drafting, dice based action selection, tableau/engine building and, of course, passage of time that influences it all. Base game is pretty self-contained, I can see it being played for decades. Drafting and card combos galore make it feel like a full CCG in a single box, with powerful combos and occasional lucky draws, yet mechanics are very euro-ish and solid.
Expansions add a lot of cool cards and new combos, but other stuff there (one-time use tokens and optional rules cards) looks more like fan-made content and a bunch of random homerules than like properly designed developement of the game. It's ok for variety, but ultimately I don't care about it and I believe it's there just to fill the box. But if you really like the game, the cards are worth it.
Also, I have played this game online on BGA first, and decided to buy it afterwards. Game publishers that don't allow their content online are just shooting themselves in the leg.

Pretty good, but not sure what all the hype was about.  It feels very much like Macao-lite, in that you are under pressure to play all your cards, trying to plan ahead to get the resources to play them, and deciding which order to play them to make the most out of the combo effects.  I don't care so much for the drafting at the beginning - I like more in Macao how you can see some of what cards will be available in the future and use the turn order mechanic to decide how important it is to have first pick on cards - this let's you jump into the game faster. There is also a lot more planning ahead in Macao - trying to the have the right resources at the right time - whereas in Seasons, you're more at the whim of what rolls, with a little planning based on what the odds are of getting certain resources each season. I wish the seasons theme was stronger (hence the name of the game) - you never really feel like you're in summer or winter.

A card game decorated with dice. The seasons flow along the game progress and different elements are generated accordingly. You play your card from your hand and score and attack other players.

Randomness of dice, randomness of card draw, but hey - it's got pretty pictures.

Players roll dice in order to get actions and resources, that allow them to play cards with special powers on the table, and score points. Nice, but a little brainy, cause there are so many interactions. It probably lasts longer than it should; two "years" would be enough. Some cards seems overpowered, specially the one that costs just one token and cancels four points to all rivals. The pasted theme and the players' colors (purple, orange, gray and light green) are odd; too fairy for my tastes. Nevertheless, the art is nice. Overall a good experience, but if I'm on the mood for special powers and rolling some dice in a light game, I would probably pull "To Court the King" first.

It's quite light, pleasant to play, very pretty if you like that kind of art... but man where is the originality? Another things that bugs me is that, after repeated play online, I feel there isn't as much diversity as I would expect in this kind of games. This screams extension, but... I've already walked this road too many times.

In short: online it's a nice way to fill in a 10-15 minute break, but I don't think I'll buy it anytime soon.

Inoffensive. There's some interest in managing the seasons and the elemental energy. The dice are attractive. Long term strategy is viable if you do the full draft for your starting cards. As a whole it never really gels. The main strike against it is it's yet another game with little text on cards, and there are other games that do that better with less fuss. And it doesn't help that the terminology ("power", "crystals", "energy") is so interchangeable that you can't even remember what the cards do from turn to turn.

Dice drafting is an interesting idea. I enjoy the game, but I wish that drawing many cards was better. The problem is that some cards are only really good early, or only good if you have the cards to support it. You really need to come up with an early game, mid game, and late game because of the way the initial cards are divvied up.

I definitely had fun by the end of the first game, but I need some more play throughs to get comfortable with it. I didn't feel like I knew how close or how far away everyone was from their goal, which I'm not crazy about. But by the end, I definitely was enjoying myself.

RATING: 6
I like the game overall but the fact that knowing the cards well really will affect how well a player does limits it. It really only makes sense to play with people who have played as much as you have. This limits the ability to introduce it to new players and have an enjoyable game.

Differentiates itself from the other card-drafting games by spicing up the rest of the game so that it can pass itself off as a rare 2-player card-drafter. I'm not really a fan of card-drafting (high overhead for new players, rewards memory and spot-the-difference), but I warmed up to the rest of the game.

The vibrant artwork showed off the game's soul. The multi-choice dice drafting each turn was interactive while providing interesting decisions (what's not taken advances the season at a different rate). The setting is thoughtful, with resources corresponding to different seasons, and the paint job makes sense. Picking a strategy by splitting your cards into 3 piles to play with didn't seem as agonizing as I had expected or hoped, but is still interesting nonetheless.

This is a much healthier game than the shitpile that is The Castles of Burgundy. This one has interactive dice-drafting, and you actually build something meaningful over the course of 3 rounds. Seems like the logical next step for King of Tokyo fans.

3+3

Pretty interesting mechanic combining dice with the rondel.  I also like how the players dictate the speed of the game somewhat by deciding which die to leave at the end of a round.  There is some "take that" interplay and I have to say that it's definitely gone onto my want to buy list.  It's the game that Quarriors should have been.

I've bumped this to a 9 based on 2p.  It's probably an 8 with 3p and a 7 (at best) with 4p.  An excellent 2p game!

RATING: 1
It's game that leaves a player with an existential question at the end of the session: [i]"what the hell were we doing for the last 60 minutes?"[/i]

Seasons brings all sorts of things to the table and unto the table, as it is a tableau builder - there are dice, cards, interlocking power and many things with no rhyme nor reason. Firstly synergy of anything with anything is a bit clunky - do this, to do that, so that over there can combo with the thing over over here. Basically the game gives you lots of stuff to juggle plus immediate,  intermediate and long range plans (by splitting your hand in 3 parts of the game). 

The problem is, when the game is over and you look over what have you been juggling all the stuff for, the game says nothing, shows nothing, is nothing. There's no narrative, no theme, there's no even enjoyment of having build something as - a) not much was done, b) what was done doesn't look like anything cohesive. What this game is about is anybody's guess. And thus the worst insult it throws at the players are these cutesy, nowadays more and more common french comicbook style illustration, that try to give an impression the game is about something, anything. It's not. It's themeless. Might as well be Mondrian art on all the cards (which would be bold and kinda honest), but it seems Ze french designerz love ze cute little creturez and clunky card synergies. It reminded me of Gosu with more stuff and more pictures and less cohesion which would bind the bits together. And the forced cutesyness. 

So: it's a juggling + optimisation game, and as there are dice and a variety of cards,  there's a lot to do without it getting calculable. Problem is - there's no theme, no narrative, you're generating a lot of points, but hadn't built anything, neither an engine nor a proper tableau. Yet, the game keeps you busy for the sake of keeping you busy (not to notice the chasm the size of English Channel where the theme ought to be) - there's a lot of bookkeping with so many effects being triggered by this or that. It's kinda like Terra Mystica in that regard - keeps you busy so you don't notice you're not doing anything. It's also shorter than TM and nicer looking. But as pointless. It's a cute game that keeps you involved, just when it's over nothing remains - no feelings, no story, nothing.

rating down to 1.0: because it's a completely themeless collection of mechanisms with no rhyme nor reason and yet some think it has a theme. What theme? What is it about? Yeah. I don't want such abuse of theming seen in boardgames that's why 1.0 [which for me means: hope nobody makes such games again]

Muy buen juego de cartas y dados. El juego es precioso, desde las cartas, con unas ilustraciones muy chulas, hasta los dados, todos diferentes y enormes.
En un principio los jugadores tendrán que elegir sus cartas por medio de un draft y despues se irán jugando gracias al poder que te generan los dados.
Las primeras partidas cuesta cogerle el ritmo, pero una vez que hayas jugado unas partidas, es un juego que engancha. Muy recomendado para 2 jugadores.

Seasons is a simple drafting game with a strong cool factor due to its lush illustrations and pretty components. While the initial draft may seem like where most of the game takes place, there are plenty of decisions to be made throughout the game regarding the order in which cards are played and which dice to draft.

I've upped my ratings for Seasons over time as there is quite a lot about the game to discover, such as when is the best time to play particular cards and dealing with the metagame. There are issues of imbalanced cards, but I can live with those - I play with the fixed versions of the underpowered Balance of Ishtar and Idol of the Familiar, although Temporal Boots is still a bit overpowered.

Arranging the cards which have been summoned according to their effects is important, as there is a high chance that players will miss out on important effects as the game wears on. Seasons works well with 2 and 3 players, but I would avoid it with 4 as the downtime can be frustrating.

There is to much good to say about this game. It is like you are given a puzzle then you have to then put in order. Then with that order you have to put the peices together to battle everyone around you. then you have another puzzle to figure how to the heck can you put them all together using the dice you were given. NOOO dont pick that dice i want it! AAARRGGG you played that card its killing me. REVENGE! then at the end you add up all the points and crown the new wizard. On thing that honestly sucks is the point tracker. WTF is that sooo hard to keep track of your score. looks ok until you play with it. it really sucks they should fix that.

I would like to play this game more so that I can finally play with the full range of cards. Each time I have played thus far, it has either been with new players or after not having played for a long time. I love the special, chunky dice in this game. And you can get some really cool combos going on with cards to earn massive crystals(points).

Amint megláttam, hogy kockás játék rögtön érdekelni kezdett, mindenkitől csak jót hallottam róla és tulajdonképpen egy tényleg jó játékról beszélhetünk, de nem igazán az én stílusom sajnos. Kicsit King of Tokyo, hatalmas kockák, gyönyörű kártyák, kicsit Dominion, kicsit Gosu, lapok, amiket kombózni kell. És ez utóbbi az, ami nem igazán az én asztalom. Több körön át a kezdőjátékos dob az adott évszak kockáival és egymás után választunk ki egyet magunknak. 4 jelölőt gyűjtünk, amiből a játék elején kapott, választott 9 kártyát játszhatjuk le magunknak. A kártyaszám nőhet a játék folyamán, célunk velük kristályok, a győzelmi pontok gyűjtése. Minden kártyából kettő van, amik sajnos nyelvfüggőek, de 2-3 játék után megtanulhatók. 2-3 fő út vezet a győzelemhez. Az alapkártyákkal talán nem lenne benne túl sok játék, de kiegészítőkkel már jóval több. A játék nekem nem tetsző részei: 4-en a játék már rendesen elhúzódhat, kicsit szerintem hosszabb is a kelleténél, de kell ez a hosszúság a lapok kombóinak megvalósítása miatt. 4-en már sok a holtidő, ezért egyértelműen 2-en és 3-an jó játszani. A szerencsének rendesen szerepe van a kockák miatt és mivel összesen 2 újradobókártya van, ezért jelentős, sőt az sem biztos, hogy ugyanannyiszor kezd minden játékos. Talán több újradobó lehetőséggel lehetne ezen kompenzálni. Mivel rengeteg pont gyűjthető, ezért ezt kis kockákkal és győzelmi pont jelelő táblával oldották meg, ami könnyen elmozdulhat. Túl sok pont van a játékban, túl sokszor kell a pontjelzőkkel bíbelődni. Összességében ez inkább komoly játék a kockák ellenére is, mint partyjáték. Nem rossz, akinek a Gosu, King of Tokyo, Dominion bejön az mindenképp próbálja ki.

A mix of card and dice drafting with the potential of combos, engines and player interaction that somehow works instead of collapsing in a mess.

This works pretty well as a 2 player game. Multiplayre and especially 4 player you lack control and it takes a lot longer -- can't help but feel that for multiplayer 7 Wonders provides the same sort of feel in a cleaner package.

For 2 player, I dislike the drafting at start of game, as the card effects are complicated but knowing what your opponent is capable of can be important; too much incentive to memorize/write down every card you saw (which would be tedious). Maybe with experience just a general "feel" of what combos they have in hand and what offensive cards is good enough though.

Seasons is a very beautiful game, but it can also be pretty mean. I normally don't like games with too much direct conflict, but this one doesn't bother me too much. The main issue I have with the game is that it becomes increasingly fiddly to keep track of everything that triggers when things start happening. This is made worse with three and four players. As such, I won't play this with more than just two. At that count it's easy enough to manage and enjoyable. The flow of the game is pretty simple and easy to get into. It's a shame that it seems to have been forgotten recently, but it's a game that likely has a spot in my collection for the foreseeable future.

It's Magic for people that don't want to have to buy into Magic.  Now, I don't want to imply that it is a clone, because it isn't.

Some nice novel mechanics in this one: I like how you draft both the cards initially and the dice later, and there seems to be just enough different ways to use the dice to make for some interesting choices. I also appreciate how the players dictate the pace of the game in their dice selections.

This would have been an excellent game were it not for the imbalance of cards (an expansion could totally fix the issues of unstoppable, 'broken' combos). The game itself is very playable, even addictive (people who hate drafting or reading cards look elsewhere) but there aren't enough cards that discard/destroy/prevent the use of other players' cards. This can lead to a player with a good combo sapping you for all you're worth every turn.

This was just a convoluted mess, didn't know if it wanted to be a dice drafting, card drafting or engine building game.

Card combo game with individual player boards and a lot more optimization than interaction. In some ways, Seasons reminds me of 7 Wonders. Superficially, there's the great artwork. More importantly, both games offer multiple paths to victory balanced against each other. And much of the challenge is in learning the cards. It's not something I'd suggest, but I might play again with fewer than the maximum number of players to minimize downtime.

[u]First play, 3er [/u]

[b]--- Game Summary ---[/b]
The game is played over 3 rounds (years). A board tracks time in each year, using a 12-stop counter divided into 4 seasons (the specific time is indicated with a token). That board also shows the types of resources available that season, and the conversion rates for each resource (into crystals = VP). Place the (n+1) dice (different for each season) next to the appropriate part of the board. Player boards have storage space for 7 resources, indicators for 4 extra abilities (each use, to a max of x4, costs you more VP at end of game), and a track to show display capacity (i.e., the max number of cards you may have in play). 

Start the game by drafting 9 cards (we played basic game, with specific hands). Each player then divides them into 3 groups of 3, to use for each of the 3 game years. Cards cost various combinations of resources, and give you various bonuses (e.g., VP at end of game, in-game powers like converting your resources into VP, taking other players VP away, move the time counter, etc.).

Each round, the starting player rolls the n+1 dice for the current season (all of which have unique distributions of faces). Then each player selects a die. Then, take your turn. The die faces may provide you with 1-2 resources, or a new card from the deck; advance your card capacity; and/or allow you to convert resources into VP. You can also use powers on any cards in your display. The die faces also have 1-3 dots; advance the time counter that many steps on the time tracker. If you advance to a new year, add the appropriate cards to your hand. If you advance into year 4, the game ends -- most VP (on track + from cards in display - penalty of 5VP for each card left in hand) wins!

That was a lot of fun! And I found out that it's available for online play at [url=http://www.boardgamearena.com]BGA[/url] so I will definitely be playing it again! They had only 60 copies or so flown in for the show, and those sold out on the first day.

The game has hand management (both in splitting the cards at the start, and in playing them during the game), resources management, action-selection (die selection), ways to fiddle with the pace of the game (by moving the time counter around, as well as when picking which die to leave unchosen), card-combinations for the CCG-lovers ... lots of little things woven together in a way that makes the game flow well. Like those CCGs, much of the intricacy (and rules headaches?) is going to come from the combination of cards you get and play. The randomness of the dice is there, but I don't think it's too much; there are usually useful choices, and everyone gets first pick in rotation. 

Looking forward to playing this more!

[u]Update after several more plays online[/u]

You know what? This has convinced me -- I just don't like drafting! It's a neat idea, an equalizer of sorts when you have cards of varying powers and different combinations. But I'm just no good at it! I didn't like it way back when, when I played Magic and I don't like it now! It's a bit better in 7 Wonders, where you're simply playing the card right away, but I don't like having to figure out on-the-fly which combinations are going to work, and how I should construct my deck! I'd much rather take some time up front to construct my deck, then play it out. Sort of like in Magic: I much preferred the simple Sealed Deck format -- do the best with what you're given -- rather than the popular drafting versions. Maybe that partially explains my ambivalence towards Dominion and similar games ....

So, good game but I'll drop my rating a bit from the initial 7.5 -- it's just not going to hold interest for me in the long run.

Right now, this is my favorite of the lighter fare of games I own.  The gameplay is simple and easy to teach.  You draft a set of nine cards that you'll get in groups of three throughout the game and each turn you draft the result of a die roll and take actions based on your collection of cards and dice.  The winner is the person with the most victory points at the end of the game.  See, easy.

What I love about it is there is a lot of depth and a decent amount of variety just under the surface there.  Players have a small amount of control over the progression of the game which can fit well into certain strategies.  Each season of the game comes with different availability of resources used in the game so a good amount of planning is involved.  And there are 100 cards (2 each of 50 different ones) that do a large variety of different things.  Some directly attack your opponent, some provide resources, and some make up some pretty interesting combos (my favorite, which my wife used against me, is playing the card that allows you to draw 4 and play one for free...and getting the 30 VP card that costs 20 to put into play).

I would also like to point out that the production of this game is FANTASTIC!  The components are all very high quality and the artwork is gorgeous with a cute, fun style.  And the box insert is an example every game publisher should follow.  It properly contains and separates all the components making them easy to organize and retrieve on repeat plays.  The card slots are even designed to hold sleeved cards.

Seasons is a card- and dice driven action selection type of game in which each player takes control of a magician that is participating in a grand sorcery tournament held over 12 seasons (hence the name of the game). The winner of this competition is crowned the new archmage.

While all dice are rolled by the same person in the beginning of each round (to establish the available actions that the players choose from), each player have a personal (drafted) deck of cards that is used to form a strategy. 

The goal of the game is to gain the most "magical crystals". During the game, these are gained by card- and dice play, and later on spent as resources in order to play more cards. At the same time, the player with the most crystals at the end of the game, is the winner. As such, it is a strategic game where one must weigh the value of one's existing crystals against the potential gain of spending them on card play.

The first "dice drafting" game I've played, and I wasn't totally sold. It's a neat mechanic, but the game feels like it's longer than it needs to be, and very fiddly as you get into the latter half of the game and have multiple effects that happen each time you take a certain action.

I have really come to enjoy the game.  Drafting games tend to be high on my list of liked games, and this is the first one I have encountered with dice drafting.  I like that the game has a lot of variation in that your cards will be different every time, but the deck is always the same.  I also like the extra rules that the expansions provide, especially the starting game rules.

I also own the following expansions:
-Enchanted Kingdom

Mechanically the game is sound but fiddly with a lot of interaction to keep track of = Better on Board Game Arena.
Components are great and the big chunky dices are marvelous = Better on the table.
This is an abstract through and through. There are better abstract-ish games out there with slight theme that work better. I.E. Ginkgopolis
The player interaction is great and the game is boring without the attack cards.
The game was designed as, and is best as, a 2 player. 3 is okay. 4 is not good.

Seasons is hard to pin down, but mostly it's a card combination game like, for example, Dominion, Race for the Galaxy and Jambo. Resources come from a common die pool, which adds interesting decisions.

I like it, but even after nearly ten plays, it's still a bit hard to get a feel for the game. Points earned during the game (e.g. by selling energy tokens) seem to matter, but I have the feeling that in most games, the point value of the cards dominate.

But because of the many card sand the drafting system, replayability seems high, so with like-minded players, I can easily see this getting at least a few dozen plays.

OK game but it really suffers with 4 players. There is too much interaction between cards resulting in a half-minute stop in gameplay each time player activates or summons a power card. I imagine that this problem is minimized in a two player game but I have not tried it yet.

So... what was the theme of this game again?  Now I do think that the game is very well designed and well produced, with pleasingly large and chunky dice.  It's just that board gamers seem to loose their poop over any game that allows them to play card combos to create cool effects (I suspect that it's related to the popularity of Magic The Gathering, although I have no personal experience with that game), but it really doesn't excite me all that much.  So again, great game design, but not much of a "fun factor" for me, despite winning my first and only game (with 3 players) with a blowout score of over 250 points.  Also, I'm not quite sure what to make of the artwork.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 1.5/5  Total: 5.5/10

RATING: 7.5
The Prelude phase is a very thinky decision-making phase blooming with possibilities and combos that the player needs to carefully navigate through to draft their way to a well-formulated deck of 9. The interactions between card effects are very interesting, and can combo together in clever ways that leave players wanting more. The tournament phase, however, leaves little room for exciting activity save for rolling and choosing dice and can feel like a slow process of harvesting dews from morning leaves in order to fuel the Prelude-designed engine, as the entry of new cards are very limited by dice rolls and availability of energy tokens. Roughly speaking the Prelude, about 10-15% of the game time, can thus determine 80% of the game's outcome. Metaphorically speaking Seasons can feel like a game where, in order to partake in the joy of desigining a car blueprint, the player has to assemble said car with bits and scraps, then also do the work of refilling its fuel tanks and cleaning it up occasionally. Aside, nearing the final year in Seasons causes players to crash into elongated periods of analysis paralysis and optimization bouts, making downtime very painfully long. Last year notwithstanding normal turns can also be plagued by downtime as there is virtually nothing to do on another player's turn save for resolving usually-bad events brought about by their familiars. Gifted, but can be bogged down by potential gameplay fiddliness, downtime, and feelings of mundaneness in the tournament phase especially for players with a fear of the above.

Annoying game. I should like it — I enjoy creating combos, I'm not afraid of cards with a lot of rules, yet this game isn't working the way I like. Comparing to other card games I cannot do enough things with my cards. Despite draft I don't feel I have enough control over what I have in my hand. And dice also don't help me control what resources I have. After one play with four players I feel exhausted. Not my cup of tea. Maybe for two players it's at least faster.

Starts with card drafting and that is the only bad thing about it, when playing with newbies.

It is a lot more fun when drafting, then with the predefined decks.

It has a lot of weight, definitely not a casual game.

I like to play it, over and over again.

Nicely balanced.

Really like the fact that cards have different costs depending on the number of players.

Just enough variance.

Strange, but good game.

I say strange, because normally you are looking for resources to buy you (a part of) the card subset of options (think any deckbuilder/dice-builder). Here, you begin with a set of cards, but if you focus on the resources (both energy as summoning power) you'll have about half the game left with no cards to play anymore. And if that happens, it is boring.

Downtime is also an issue, as in the midgame your options explode (which cards to play, in which order), giving a slight 'grinding' feel which is worse the more people are involved. Hence, best with 2, and not recommended at all with 4.

Final (minor) remark: game can be a bit fiddly because the markers that track everything are just small cubes sitting upon smaller score tracks. Don't bump your table.

Now, why is it a good game? As the cards themselves are interesting to play, you can make cool combinations, the component quality is excellent, the choices you make in your turn (if you have anything to do) are interesting and the drafting part (as soon as you know what you are doing) injects a great amount of strategy into the game. 

Requires some plays to get into, as the pre-constructed decks might not be your playstyle, and if you don't know that cards are so valuable you might focus on energy/summoning first only to discover you've played them all well before the end of the game. If you are aware of that and have moved beyond pre-constructed the game begins to show it's greatness. 

A more involved dice driven card game. For fans of fantasy, casting and strategy.

First part of the game is a draft. In the rest of the game you are rolling dice, choosing a dice that was rolled and completing the action, and playing spells and creatures for different effects. The rest of the game is accounting in disguise.

I don't think I'd play this again with four, I think two is probably the right number to play with.

This seems to be the first game I've seen which was made following the success of 7 Wonders because EVERYTHING is drafted here; draft your cards initially, then draft dice the whole way through the game. Unfortunately what is missing here are simultaneous actions. This game drags. Three of the four players at the table were ready for it to be over before the end of the second year because there really aren't many actual decisions to be made.

Oh, and the 'draw four cards and play one for free' is incredibly stupid in a game where that might score you between 8 and 30 points.

If you are interested in setting up wild card combos to try to maximize your score every turn, with a little bit of drafting for a base each turn, then this is your game.

It was okay, but it gets to a point where the dice don't matter at all, and it's all about what you have out in front of you each turn, which after a while makes it kind of fiddly trying to keep up with all the interactions.  

It's just not for me I guess.

Really fun to set up card combos or an energy engine. I had some misgivings, but now I can safely say I love it. May still have flaws (I haven't decided yet) but I will continue to play it.

But when I do win, it really is something else.

Tentative rating based on a single play. While I like the innovative mana generation mechanic, it concerns me how often 'lock down' combinations seem to come up. We had one (put together by me) in our game, and based on conversations with a couple of the players, it's not uncommon.

I'm willing to try it again, but I'm unlikely to buy this one unless my feelings change significantly.

On top of that, I found a lot of downtime between turns as people would be looking at their cards and energy, trying to figure out which cards they could play and which ones would be beneficial that turn.

I dunno. Maybe there's something here. But I had no way to draw cards and we rolled cards only twice during the entire game (both taken by players ahead of me in turn order), so I essentially did nothing for the final third of the game. I suppose you could build a deck that would avoid this problem, but with the recommended starter decks, there definitely seemed to be some design issues here.

The draft of the game is so important that the strategy of the game is heavily comparable to Dominion. In Dominion, you decide your strategy before even the first turn. Similarly, in this game, your draft will heavily dictate if you can compete in the game.
After that, I compare the game to the resource management of Settlers of Catan. For instance, you gain resources nearly every turn based on the roll of the dice. Then, you are deciding what to build towards and what resources you need for this turn or a few turns down the road. 
Top it off with beautiful art and the game is worth more plays than most games these days.

However, the emphasis on the draft means that actually playing the game can be a "waste" of time where the cards drafted have already dictated that one player will have a superior game.
Second, the art is nice, but there is actually no story in the game. The resource management takes high precedence over any interest in cards because there isn't actually a world of characters in the game, just fancy names.
Downtime is a problem. The four player game would surely take longer and create odd swings of points. The two player game will be worth playing because of the speed of the game and the impact between the cards will make sense since you will always impact the game whether you add points or make them lose points.

Good solid competitive game, I weight it at a medium game play as there is a lot to keep track of during your turn and during the round and so many different strategies to use in the game.

RATING: 7
Unique mechanics, custom dice, the seasonal changes, and great drafting that makes for a fun experience which can be stymied by analysis paralysis and the limited player count. Unfortunately, the drafting mechanic can make or break a player's game, holding back the experience from being something special.

Drop-dead gorgeous card art and other components make Seasons a must-play, but will you want to play it again?  There is a carnival of unpredictability:  card drafting, dice, and take-that player interactions.  They make the game more accessible for children and newbies by breaking strategies.  But the labyrinthine card interactions, scoring, and board maintenance slow the whole machine to a crawl.  It's a lot to keep up with when so much is left to chance.

Szép játék és nagy reményekkel vágtam bele, de pofára ejtett. Ottvan az a sok szép lap és alig használunk közülük. Ha a másik bemákol egy konfrontatív lapot a játék legvégéig elnézegethetem ahogy lopkodja a pontjaimat és semmit nem tehetek ellene. Néha lehet benne szépeket kombózni, de ahhoz képest mennyire eseménytelen az elejétől a végéig túl hosszú. Esemény alatt azt értem amikor kijátszol egymás után több lapot a kezedből vagy kombózol magadnak 40-80 pontot a körödben.

Ressource management game with a fantasy theme. Did not play with drafting, maybe this would add to the game, so no rating. Without drafting, the game is a 5-6 for me (slightly boring, would perhaps play again).

RATING: 10
This is our groups #1 game. It is the game that everyone is always willing to play at least once, if not multiple times. While it is generally not the game we grab first it is more often than not the game we grab last as the day has waned and we need something we know we will enjoy rather than trying to play something new. I feel those that criticize the random aspects have simply not played enough to learn how to play around those aspects as even our friend that hates random loves this game. New expansions for this will always be automatic buys and I am fairly certain that this has been the most played game in my group for the past couple years.

The guy who taught me the game described it as "7 Wonders meets Quarriors meets Magic."  That's about right.

It's not the friendliest game for newbies.  The rules aren't much to absorb, but paying attention to the quickly expanding tableau of cards in front of each player is.

UPDATE: I had a much easier time following along the second time I tried it, even though it was years later.  My rating went up a bit.  In my limited experience, it would seem that drafting a trio of hands that will have good synergy are the most crucial decisions to make, and the rest of the game is kinda just seeing whether or not your drafting was more successful than your opponents.

This is a really fun, novel game; I like it a great deal! Not everyone agrees, my friends are annoying harsh on it (blah), but I felt like there's a lot to love. 

One really cool thing is the game simulates a contest of magic between wizards to determine the new arch-mage... but it's not a game or war or battle. Your actions instead are displays of power meant to impress... So it's essentially non-violent, which is rad if you're worrying about kids and messages to them. The game mostly works off resource management, timing of card plays, and a draft mechanic... which are all well designed and elegant. Set up and tear down are brief, it doesn't take up excessive space, and is fairly easy to learn and teach. The game doesn't run too long either, which is also nice... 30-45 minutes is very doable. If I had to name one problem? While there's some end of round/game scoring to mix things up, it's pretty easy to figure out, if not look and see, where everyone is in terms of points. The result is that because it's possible to find behind to a point you're doomed to lose, and this makes it all the worse because you can know it.

Seasons isn't a game I adore, but it's one I respect.  Most of the people with whom I have played it have enjoyed it.  It's an interesting addition to the tableau-builder genre and one I'm usually happy to play.  It loses some points with me because the theme is a little pasted on, and because some turns pass by with very little of interest happening.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Absolutely fantastic. Love this game. Excellent components.  A perfect balance between strategic and tactical play. Also a great balance between actions/cards to help yourself and to hurt your opponents. Overall, a great pleasure.  

The theme feels a little pasted on, so that's a downside (though some users have created characters to play with on BGG in Variants).  Sometimes the clear winner can be known as early as the 2nd year if things pan out a certain way, but there are slight variants you can use to decrease the likelihood of this happening.  All in all, one of my favorite games right now.

Was skeptical at first, but so far this game is great. The cards are interesting, the art is nice and unique, and the game is pretty quick.

Seems to be meant for just two players, though. I've played one three player game and it was just tedious. Every time a card was played, it triggered several other card effects from the other two players, so there was a lot of adjustment to be made constantly.

I couldn't have been more off from my initial assumption about this game.  I saw cards, dice, the board and it looked like a complete mess.  Seemed like entirely too many mechanics in one game.  
After returning from GenCon, with the Hype continuing, I jumped on BGA and gave it a go.  My first game roped me in.  The second had me hooked, I pre-ordered it.  

It's a wonderful game that deals with drafting, dice selction and building a strong strategy up front to go into the actual game with.  Building combos, pulling extra cards.  I see this hitting the table multiple times a week.  

Hell, even my wife asks to play it daily.  

A win - win all around.

Avoids most of the pitfalls that games with cards that let you do wild things often fall into. The attack cards are effective without being too mean in my opinion, and the magic item cards let you do just enough to build a strategy around without being overpowered. The dice are big and satisfying to roll, and both the card and dice drafting are well-executed. The transmute action feels a bit tacked-on and rarely yields enough crystals to make a difference, but I do like that some elements are more plentiful in some seasons than others. Good game, especially with 4 players.

4/2013 - Played as 2-player, which was an improvement with respect to pace and length of play.

2/2013 - Outside of the dice selection mechanic, this felt surprisingly derivative considering the hype, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I quickly felt comfortable with the ruleset. Everything worked pretty well, the choices at hand were fun, allowing for some pretty cool combinations.

However, I don't think I liked this as a 4-player game. It results in a bit too much down time, and makes the game a little longer than it feels like it should be. 

I'd be happy to play this again as a 2 or 3 player game.

This game is like a psychedelic hybrid of 7 Wonders and Magic the Gathering--in a good way. In some ways it feel very like 7 Wonders: at its core is the drafting of cards, play is broken up into three distinct stages, etc.. But a difference you'll noticed right away is that this game allows you to build combos which take advantage of complimentary card functions. As a (reformed) MTG "Johnny" I'm delighted by this.

Also, since this game has the entire draft take place at the very beginning, it makes it easier to plan ahead. You don't know all the cards you'll have during the game, but you know enough to make specific plans about the end game from the very beginning. This also helps new players, who in 7 Wonders are unable to anticipate what they'll need in future ages until they start memorizing the cards. Here they can just look at the cards for the next years to remind themselves what resources will be called for.

On the other hand this mechanic means that unlike 7 Wonders you'll spend a lot of time waiting for others to complete turns, which is unfortunate.

Was my favorite game for a long time when I first started getting deep into the hobby, and still a Top 10 Game for me.  The initial card draft, then the continual dice draft is my favorite element.  The art is vivid and gorgeous.  And the strategy is deep but not clunky or overwhelming.  Have yet to play a game that looks like the one before it.

Mixed feelings... When i play seasons i have a lot of fun, but the sensation to be playing a weird version of Magic: the gathering is very high... Well, the game works fine, fluid, not too difficult. But still the mechanics are a bit tedious (it's clear that all the calculations were originally intended for a machine) and the artworks do not work at all. Even demons are kawaii... please...
Buy the way anytime I play I have a fun hour, so I moderately suggest it.

Fun dice chucker with a novel theme of the game changing through the Seasons. Finite number of turns and the ability to alter the speed of the game through dice drafting are neat mechanics. A limited number of "cheats" per game is pretty cool, too. Can get a little AP deciding which cards to bury in which piles.

OK there really is nothing wrong with this game it just happens to be that it's not my cup of tea...at all. It takes the idea of the basic card game of this sort and throws it into a dice game style of setting. I like that it's got a definite ending to it and not some play until someone gets X points or something like that. Just not interested in this game at all really but I see how plenty of people would love this one.

One of the best card games. It is a gamer's card game and not so much a casual card game like 7 Wonders or Dominion. Artwork is great and the game mechanics are good and very well intertwined.

It is a good game, but the drafting part, may take a lot of time, and sometimes people with AP may push this game to a two hour session and that is too much for this game. The cards are not really balanced, but with drafting this should be mitigated.

The card draft basically decides the game. In the game I played one player and I put all the cards in play, and the third player left only one in the hand. The score? 280 / 210 / 180. With basically all the cards being used, it shows that there are cards MUCH better than others and if you weren't luck enough ti get them, well, you will lose.

How to make this game work:
1) Play with 2;
2) Select randomly the cards;
3) Give 1 copy of each card picked for each player;
4) The players than select 9 of them and put the rest, shuffled, aside (to make the draw deck). Now no one can complain much about luck (the shuffling is the luck element for this part);
5) Begin the game.

The game seems interesting, playing it was fun, though a bit hectic, a lot of luck seems to be in the cards you manage to get and it takes effort to keep an eye on that you don't miss a point from here or there.

This is a fun and really-good-looking game.  There is a lot of bookkeeping though, which can be annoying.  Also it's one of those games where you have to remember what a bunch of cards do at once, which can be kind of a pain.  I like it overall, but I wouldn't say it's fantastic.

Overall I was a bit disappointed by this game.
Each round you simply pick the resource die that you want, then pay n play a card that either gives you: victory points, resources or hurts your opponent.

Next round repeat and try to remember to apply every single card effect from your previous played cards.
Something I will start forgetting, once I have 7+ cards in front of me.

I can see why they say this game is popular with Magic the Gathering players. The games have a lot in common with out being the same. But sadly I'm not a fan of either.

I do really like the artwork though :)

I think this is a really cool game, but it can be a bit annoying to constantly have to manipulate the score track.  I love the card abilities and the dice drafting, but my score is lower because frankly I often don't feel like playing it because of how often the tiny score trackers move up and down.  With two it's not too too bad, but with three or more it's unbearable.  Still, I don't want to come off as overly harsh.  I do like the game, I just wish there were less cards that affect the score track.

Decent but unexceptional. 

Somewhat unusually, it would be much improved by having MORE die rolls. As it is, there are so few that the whole "seasons" aspect is nearly meaningless. The natural impulse is to plan using the seasonal information, e.g. "winter is coming up, so I'm likely to get blue, so I'll play this and this." However, you might get just one roll of the blue dice (two if you're lucky), and there's an excellent chance there will be no blue rolled.

I have no particular objection to having the game be more about using what you get than planning, but it does make the four sets of dice seem silly.

-Great dice
-Fantastic artwork

-Great CCG/TCG detox game

Bad:
-Can drag with four players
-Scores bounce up and down too often
-Some cards are needlessly fiddly
-Can be too many permanent effects to track
-Unbalanced cards
-Only 50 unique cards and 100 total
-Playing someone with two of the same permanent effect
-Why crystals and prestige?

Overall:
If you miss or just detoxed from a CCG/TCG, this is great transition game for you.  If you have little to no CCG/TCG/LCG experience and your competition does, prepare to lose the first few games and still have a great time.  I'd recommend that people brand new to board games hold off until they get a little more experience with the hobby.  Also, the game seems to play better after some of the more fiddly cards are removed.  I have elected to remove cards that cause the score to see-saw because they made the scoring too fiddly.

I know this game already came out at Gencon, but for me it is THE highlight of Essen 2012. It is very addictive and looks absolutely gorgeous when laid out on the table. My girlfriend and I played our first two games with the recommended beginner decks. After those plays, we felt we were familiar with all the beginner cards, and ready to mix in the drafting mechanic. I am sure that this will ensure tons of replayability, even before we touch the advanced cards. So far, I have not experienced any really big gaps in our scoring, but even if that would happen, it will not be so bad because experienced players can finish a game within an hour. Highly recommended.
UPDATE: Played with drafting AND the advanced cards, and loved it even more than before. Not as hard as imagined, great fun, very addictive. The final tally of points is more often than not very surprising!
UPDATE: Finally got a game in with three players. The drafting and the familiar cards get more interesting with more players, but considering the randomness in the game, the longer playing time is a disadvantage. In the end, I like it better with two. Rating settles on an 8.

Cute game, great graphics and a thematically a bit reminiscent of Magic where creatures and items are summoned. The comparison stops right there though. Here, the summoned creatures do nothing except score victory points in the end (oh how so Euro). In any case, the game is quite novel and I haven't quite played anything like it. Elemental magics are harvested by rolling and selecting dice. There is a balancing act between cashing in on the elemental tokens during by transmuting vs. using them to summon creatures or objects. The push pull is nice. The one variable that can be rather swingy are the die rolls. Only a subset of dice are rolled and one is selected each turn. You get what you get. sometimes, the best laid plans are wasted because the dice gods are not in your favor. Fun game. I can see why there is an ardent fan base for this game.

Seasons is a draft game, with more meat on the bones than 7 Wonders. Its a curious game and I remained intrigued after my first play, enough to give it a second chance. The most recent play left me less inclined to play again since it I drafted quite well, only to have an opponent draw extra cards to steal a win. 

I felt like there wasn't much chance for me to change strategies as the 'Draw a Card' option didn't come up on the dice so I was locked into a losing strategy. I wonder if this game wouldn't benefit from multiple drafts between years only so you have more options to maneuver.

The artwork is gorgeous, just a pity the game isn't as rich as I'd like. Magic the Gathering is still the best draft game in existence, everything just pales in comparison to it.

15/07/14 - Rating dropped from 4 to 2. The taxing strategy seems incredibly dominant, drowning out any other strategy. The game is swingy (with the luck of the draw) and devoid of answers to the tax strategy. I'm done with this game.

15/10/14 - Rating dropped from 2 to 1. Not sure why I didn't just drop this straight to 1. Never playing this again.

A game I'd be willing to play almost anytime, but I don't need to own.  Can't say exactly why.  It just didn't WOW me as much as I thought it would.  It's probably the lack of genuine theme.  The seasons concept feels totally pasted on and the effects of the cards just felt like I was playing a Dominion variant.  Sounds like I hated it, but that's not true.  A good game, but not a great one.

After more plays I enjoy it immensely. The drafting is satisfying and I can't wait to play with the "expert" cards. Figuring out what combos you can try and pull off while playing is great as well. Highly recommended. Kind of like building a CCG deck but with only 9 cards

I'm still not sure if i like this game, but i seem to play it a lot

Edit: I find it ok 2p, but i've found with 3 and 4 it can be a chore, not just because of the added length, but also because certain cards become (particularly familiars) can become extremely powerful with more players. For example, in a 2p game, if someone plays Arcano Leech and Thieving Fairies in the first year, it's still possible to overcome this obstacle. In a 4p game, you may as well forfeit right then and there. Also, card effects like these don't feel particularly thematic, and just add a deadening amount of accounting to the game. Winning because you siphoned 4-6 points from your opponents every turn isn't particularly satisfying.

I've only played this with 2 players and online, but I can't imagine it's any better live - the cards are too similar, the dice don't seem to change the game enough, and there doesn't seem to be a lot of strategy.  I like the idea of this game but playing it is tedium.  Perhaps live, with cool components, this might be good, but it also seems like it is quite long.

My 7.5 rating is a bit misleading, seeing as this is my most players game I own. Although,boardgamearena is to thank for that. I've had a lot of really fun experiences with this game, but the lower rating goes to the potential for the game to drag and make you want to end it(bad draft, one pips always being left so the game moves along at snail pace)

Still a great game to explore card combos, synergies, dice drafting, card drafting. A complete game.

Overall, I've been pretty impressed with this game so far. For someone that hasn't been able to hold their interest in more open deck construction like you see with Magic the Gathering, this scratches an itch. The drafting phase lets you strategize against your opponents and the seasons decks bring in some neat timing elements. Additionally, I love the seasons track/dice that bring in a bit of randomness while providing enough information and options to mitigate luck some. Loosely put, this is an interesting game, but sadly I can see my MtG playing friends frustrated with it simply for the fact it's not MtG.... Which is a shame since this is a good little design.

Liked it, but unsure how I feel about just how strong some of the combos can be.  Specifically think the game might be better without Chalice.

...With another player many years later, it can be SUPER fiddley.  With the right types of cards, there's a ton of constant minute adjustments of the scores, and especially with the awkward score track it's very easy to screw up along the line.

Love everything about this game. Card drafting, dice-resource gathering, crazy spell effect, familiars, amazing art and colours. Love it all. Sadly it sees limited plays because if people aren't already familiar with the cards the drafting phase takes a looong time and it's enough to scare some people off.

I have a hard time rating this one.  I have a good time every time we play, but we've had it nearly a year and have only played 3 times.  I think, while it's fun, it's not as enjoyable/exciting as other games we own.  The theme is nothing special - just kind of generic cartoony characters.  The mechanics are fun and I do like the way dice are used in Seasons, but they're just not enough to put this over the top into our favorites list.  Have only played it at 2P, but I don't think the rating would improve at 3-4P.

There's a magical sweet spot for me between a games length, how quickly the turns move, satisfying decisions that don't completely melt my brain, and variability.  Seasons hits it.

I do have complaints though, a lot of the "end of round", "change of season" effects are finicky to remember and keep track of.  Games can vary wildly on score outcome, but hard to say if that is actual imbalance of the cards, or varying player experience at this time.

Really good dice drafting game. 
Setup takes a bit, and knowledge of the card pool helps greatly. Playing this game with one experienced player and no others, the experienced player should win. 

Artwork is stunning, components are really nice too. 
Graphic design is very good. 

Someone should have run a spell check as there are several spelling errors, and really disappoints me everytime I see them.

Colorful dice with different symbols.  You play different cards by spending elements from different seasons and get different powers and/or cyrstals.  There are three years, each with a different season.  You can transmute elements for crystals which gives you more or less depending on the season.

I had thought I wouldn't really care for this, but I ended up enjoying it a ton. It's just plain fun rolling the huge dice, collecting the energy required to get the cards into play to earn points or crystals or more energy. Just lots of cool combos. We did play with the pre-built hands and less complicated cards, so there is some concern that the higher cards might have more screwage than we usually care for.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very fun game with some amazing art and colorful pieces. There's sort of an odd disconnect between phase 1, the draft, and phase 2, the dice rolling.. stuff. The draft is a lot of fun, trying to figure out what evil combos you can put together for maximum points. Then suddenly the drafting is completely over, and it completely switches gears. The luck of the dice however seems to be overshadowed by your picks in the draft. If you have much better combos than your opponents from phase 1, you will most likely trounce them in phase 2 no matter what.

It's a good game and definitely worth playing, but I feel like it could have been a better game if phase 2 was different. Either faster, or have a larger impact on the game.

An interesting in concept game (though there are some cards I wish weren't in the game). Have yet to play a game with drafting cards at the start. 

Game can bog down when it's somewhat important which dice are used (in a 2 or 3 player game) or when someone has the ability to reroll a dice.

Still an enjoyable game.

RATING: 6
Komoly felfordulást okozott pár éve ez a kockajáték, ahol igazából egy kettős draft mechanizmus van. Elsőként kártyákból draftoljuk ki a feladatainkat (igazából spelleket), ami során figyelni kell a pontérték mellett arra is, hogy lehetőleg valami engine, vagy legalább 1-2 combo legyen benne. Aztán 3 éven, 12 évszakon keresztül d6-okat draftolunk amik erőforrásokat adnak a kártyák kijátszásához.
Nem rossz játék, de nekem egy kicsit kaotikus, túl sok minden játszik hatást egymásra, így nehéz követni, hogy most miért kapott 2 pontot az ellenfél, vagy én mire fel vesztettem 4-et. Ha viszont mindent megmagyarázunk, az tovább nyújtja, mint ameddig még fun.

RATING: 6
The game is a chaos for me: You play card, earn manna, I loose manna because you played something. And see, this allows me to earn 56098000 crystals and you loose a power card....  Apart from it, this game would be OK. There is drafting mechanism, you can decide which cards to play, you can prepare for better cards coming in later, but this is surrounded with that chaos. I will play it again, but not that fun for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Commented after the first play, the explanation of rules was quite fast and not very good. So I drafted this and that and lost, the other newbie was second last.

If you know a little bit about the cards, understand how the resources and points are gathered and so on, then you can start building valid tactics - something you can't do on the first play. Thus this is not very good for introducing new players. Another downside was that there were quite a lot of cards, which affected the points all the time, considerable time was spent adjusting the points all the time. I can play this again, but I have no special need.

AFTER 6 PLAYS, IT EARNED A PERMANENT PLACE IN THE COLLECTION

Based on three plays, it's a fun game, but I think it's getting more play than the gameplay warrants due to the cool bits (Takenoko is similar). I question its long-term replayability unexpanded because there aren't that many cards included. 

UPDATE: Sold. No desire to play it again once it got out of rotation. The worst aspects of mediocre medium-light modern euros with candy-coloured coating - fiddly, indirect interaction only, outstays its welcome. Husband has played it on BoardGameArena and agrees it's 'meh'. 

UPDATE: Re-bought a copy of Seasons since I realised we'd only played it twice and with the basic card set, not the advanced. Since it's a game where knowing the draft is important, and which benefits from more plays, I figured I'd made a mistake selling our copy.

UPDATE: I misjudged this game. After a further two plays in quick succession with the basic cards and the pre-built decks, it's fast, smooth and fun. It needs some time, thought and patience to get used to the cards. Rating increased from 6 to 8.5. Rating may increase again...

Really great, big, and fun game. Several cards and combinations offer different ways for you to win. The card directory in the manual is something that has ruined some other complicated games for me. Love how they gave that much attention to that detail. Dice are big, chunky, and just really fun to roll. Surprisingly aggressive with certain problem cards, though. In addition, the fact that crystals and points are the same thing tends to confuse newer players. These problems are easily overcome, however, since the game is just that entertaining.

Resource management + drafting + long-term strategy + luck of the dice = excellent, complex game. Cards add a lot of replayability. 

Edit @ around 100 plays: basically, this game is all about drafting and engine building. Unequal skill levels are an issue with new players. A great game with opponents who know the cards well. 

Edit @ 500+ plays: still playing, which says something.

Holding on to physical copy for sentimental value/quality of components (ie lots of dice) and for the rare in-person or induction game. Might be willing to trade away eventually. Sleeved.

Ten minutes into the game I thought: "OK, this is kinda cool." Two hours later when we finally finished our 4 player game I was in complete misery. This game wants to be 60 minutes at most, which I guess is why BGG says it's best with 2 and not recommended with 4. But even if it was brisk, I'd have no interest in playing this game. It's shallow, self-absorbed with a negligible amount of interaction. To be fair, I had no interest in playing this because I knew it was exactly the type of milquetoast mid-weight game that wouldn't appeal to me. But someone else in the group REALLY wanted to get it to the table.

RATING: 6
This is one of those games that takes one play just to learn it.  I mean, someone else can sit down and tell you how the game flows, but understanding the effects of the cards and how they all interact is going to take one game to understand.  That's not a bad thing, mind you, but it's something to take into account.

The game can be decided by wild swings in luck, even though it will take some time to build up a tableau that will allow you to draw cards, and that can be pretty frustrating.  The drafting of cards and dice helps to overcome it being simply a luckfest, but there's still some randomness from both resources.  The card combos can create a lot of chaos, too, what with the different ways that everything interacts, and while I can see that creating a lot of strategy and replayability, I'm not sure if it will be enough to overcome the frustrations one can experience during the game.

I'd play it again, but I'm glad I didn't buy it.

For some reason, Seasons "feels" the most like Magic: The Gathering than any other game. It has some drafting, but that is not it. It also has some resource management and four different kinds of mana, but that is not it. It probably has more to do with the fact that you slowly build up an array of cards that has symbiotic power. Or perhaps it is the luck:skill ratio. Who knows? 

Also, Seasons has a great way to deal with skill imbalance - there are beginners decks. All around an amazing game that makes me scratch my head why it seemed to be more of a fad.

Great tableau building game with almost infinite replayability. Figuring out a way of making the most efficient use of your cards is a very neat puzzle to solve. I just wish there were more ways of digging through the deck during the game (something similar to Race for the Galaxy's "Explore +5" action would be perfect) - that way you would have much more control over your strategy (right now everything relies mostly on initial draft).

One word of warning though - I think Seasons works best with 2 players, it's too long and too chaotic with full player count as there's too much bookeeping to take care of. With more than 30 cards in play, moving all these little wooden cubes and keeping track of every special ability every round can be a real pain. The downtime also gets significantly longer. Just stick to 1v1 games and you'll be fine.

This game is imbalanced and needlessly random. I don't understand why people love the art; it's colorful, but it's just silly cartoon drawings. Worst of all, the game is fundamentally an accounting grind as you spend the whole time moving the cubes by small amounts up and down the atrociously designed victory point board.

Seasons has quickly become one of my all-time favorite games. It's very colorful, the dice are used in a great way, and the combo's are really neat. It's fantastic to see a punishing combo come together halfway through the game, with a card that nobody wanted at the start. The time just flies by while you're playing Seasons. It plays different every time, yet is still awesome every time.

We are sorcerers in a tournament challenge all out brawl to the top of the victory point ladder. All important initial 7 wonder style spell draft determines your fate in the following card play phase. Next, we strategically divide our deck into 3 hands to be played over three phases. Elements used for spells are generated by the different seasonal dice which are drafted each turn in player turn order. The unused dice affects the passage of time--very cool mechanic. A lot of screw your neighbor, lock-you-down cards round after round. Have to play this with the right group. Steep learn curve for newbies and drafting is meanlingless to them let alone deciding which hand to put them in. My advice is to play with hands face up and ease up on the gas pedal till they get the hang of it. You will hate the player on your right by the end of this game.

My wife's number 1 favorite game. If you love card combos, drafting, and dice rolling - this is the game for you. 

We slowly added ten or so more cards every so often to keep the game fresh... and then play a bunch of times before adding more. Now we play with all the cards and are content with that. If that ever gets old there are even more options of play in the expansions!

Super Huge THANK YOU to my Secret Santa 3013! :)

First, I would rate this game between a 7 and 8, so it is a keeper. This is a good card game with a 'euro' feel to it, which in my books is a boon.

The cards each have various abilities and aside from taking advantage of playing those abilities well, there are 'season' bits to manage that will open the way for you to play your cards and gain more points. This is a great combination of cards/euro and the fantasy theme gives it a lustrous appeal. 

This game also has the advantage of not being quite like other games, so it holds a unique position in how it plays. It is very enjoyable and I would like to thank my Secret Santa again for introducing my household to this terrific gaming experience.

Wow, What a game. Seasons has earned its higher rank and It may grow even higher the more my wife and I play. Seasons is a fantastic card/board game that uses resource die to determine what cards you can play. As an old time Magic: The Gathering player, I really enjoy the card synergy and the different combos possible. 

This game is a fantastic two player game and I have yet to play it with more players.

Update 10/4/2017: I've played it with 4 players and had an enjoyable experience. But the best experience has been with 2 players and my wife and I have finally used all the cards (though we've not encountered them all). We've played around 11 times or so and that's a high number for my collection. Definitely has earned it's spot as my number 3 board game of all time.

Not played much but from what I have played, I feel I enjoy this. 
It reminds me of Legendary and as it stands, I feel that I prefer the Legendary (Marvel) theme and also gameplay to this but it will require a number more plays to determine if this assessment is accurate.
EDIT: I am keeping the score for now. One of the issues is that despite playing  a few times now, they have been at least a month apart and when I  play I feel I have to learn the cards again as I forget the synergies I came up with. Would likely be a lot better with regular play.

RATING: 3
[i]Seasons[/i] would make a good Halloween costume, as the game's lack of development is genuinely frightening.

If you like to draft cards, play Fairy Tale or Magic: The Gathering. If you like card combo games, play Race For the Galaxy, San Juan, or Dominion.  If your expectations are lower, and all you want is a functional game, then you [i]still[/i] need to look elsewhere.  [i]Seasons[/i] doesn't fit that description either.

Like any drafting game that deserves to be despised, some cards in [i]Seasons[/i] are insane must-picks and others are worthless.  This is a critical problem when only 7-12 cards hit the table (per player) over the course of a full game.

Please deal me the broken card.  Please.

Oh, then there's the card-drawing. It's nearly impossible to draw additional cards unless you get lucky (as first player) and roll a "card draw" result.  This means there's not much to do if you've played out your hand early in the year - except to earn resources and sell them for crystals.  And as much fun as a repetitious resource/crystal exchange might sound, it isn't.

Last and least, the game's too long with four players.

My assumption is that 95% of the game budget was thrown at the card artists, and the rest went into the colored ink in the rulebook. None of the money went into playtesting, that's for sure.

An OK card drafting, combo-creating game with good production values. Despite there being three levels of complexity to the game, I wish we'd started one level higher up as there wasn't an awful lot of interaction in the early games we played. The draft would have added a bit more meat to the game.

It feels like you can build powerful combos but the first few games will involve learning what cards are available. One slight annoyance is the game terms - energy and crystals sound like they could be similar things in this type of game. One of them is just VPs, so why obfuscate things?

8 based on first play (2 players.)

Fun to play.  There's a lot more game here than you can uncover in a single play, however its easy enough to learn that you dont feel lost when you start - unlike certain card drafting games (Im lookin at YOU 7 Wonders!)

Very cool mechanics make for interesting tactical play but strategy probably takes a few plays to develop.  

Feels like theres a lot of randomness, and there is, but its far from off the rails.  The way the dice are designed and the way the card draft works means that the randomness mostly works to help replayability and doesnt really defeat strategic play.

up to 8.5 and then 9 after multiple plays with 2,3 and 4 players.  Very fun and satisfying.  Currently the house favorite game.

It provides many interesting mechanisms: drafting, dice selection, cards synergy. But the most pleasant gameplay is with 2 players, when you have more choices and you are first player more often to get the needed dice or cards. With 3 or more players downtime grows and you are able to play less cards. Especially when on the last turn players start to pull off longest combos it can get very boring.

After two plays, this is exactly the kind of game I want to play. I bought cheap gems from a craft store to keep track of scoring because the scoreboard is terrible. I can't wait to learn all of the cards and the incredible combinations.

UPDATE: Have played with 3 players, and while the 2 player is much quicker, the 3 player game brought elements of the game I wasn't aware of.

I want to play this game everyday.

UPDATE: With 200+ plays in now, this game continues to be my favorite. I think that it is so superior to every other game in existence, that I feel it needs its own rank above 10, and I'll just call it the Seasons Rank.

I think this might be the only game I've played where I was wishing for smaller dice.  The art in this game is really fun, the rulebook is well laid out and was thorough enough that it answered the few oddball questions that came up during play.  The game did go a little long with 4 (even though it did play well), so I think we'll probably stick to 2p in the future just for the sake of time.

2-4 players draft a hand of 9 cards then lay them out in stacks of three to be available for each year. They then roll and pick dice that let them gather resources, expand their power, and use their cards for points and abilities. Resource availability changes as the seasons progress, and cards left in hand at the end of the game incur a penalty.

Really didn't think much of our first play would rate it 4-5 based on the experience since it felt like there was zero player interaction and not much else to do. It took us a while to try this again and found that it was much better when drafting cards instead of constructing the suggested learner decks - even when not fully knowing the rules, drafting made it more interesting. Still, my initial impression was hard to overcome and I have learned that I often dislike uninteractive, build-your-own-engine, games.

Seasons is a good looking game with really good components, but it's something I'd rate as an investment game, i.e. it will definitely be best after many repeat plays. Unfortunately that is something I'm not willing to spend on this 2-player game. There are so many great, deep, and highly thematic 2-player games, and I don't think Seasons stand a chance against them.

While there's some Magic: The Gathering elements in the game, and you have to manage the change of the seasons, but in the end it just didn't feel tense and I wasn't invested in the gameplay.

I thought this game was going to be tough to learn with its odd looking dice and an intimidating stack of cards with lots of text. Instead it was very manageable, especially to those with a Magic the Gathering background. I thought all actions after choosing dice were simultaneous, so turns moved quickly in my games. Any card timing issues were determined by player order. After finding out the rules state one player finishes their turn, and then the next one plays--hm, no. I'll stick with simultaneous actions and a fast game, thanks!

Most miserable 2 hours of gaming that I have ever had. Played against 3 experienced players who all made synergistic, powerful drafts.

I received this from Matt Lust in the 2012 Dork Den Secret Santa Exchange. Thanks Matt!

The initial card draft is enjoyable here... though you need to wait for a lot of the game to be over to reap the rewards (unlike 7 Wonders or Fairy Tale where you use your clevery selected card immediately).  The dice draft limiting your turn (and sometimes leaving you with nothing at all you can do on your turn) can be frustrating, but when the card combos are clicking and the game doesn't bog down with too many power cards doing too many little things this can be pretty fun.... but it turned out to be a bad combination of a bit too long and a bit too thinky with too much downtime and randomness for my group so it was traded away.

Too much of this game was decided in the initialt draft with very limited posibilites to adjust your strategy later in the game which gave me extremely restricted feeling playing it. It seems like a lot of people enjoy this game, but it's not for me.

Seasons showed up in the geek buzz top 20 of Spiel 2012. We didn’t seen it there, never heard of it, but when we noticed it in the list, we looked at it, and became interested. Didn’t think of it, until we read a review of this game on one of the last days of 2012. In that review, there was said, that we would like the game very much. As we were very busy at that moment, we didn’t think much about it after that. Then we saw it popping up in a lot of ‘top 10 of ’12’ video’s. It popped up again. Started to watch some reviews and it seemed like fun to me, but would it be fun enough to own a copy of our own? I wasn’t sure. Then I discovered that we could play this game with two online. Of course, I didn’t know how the game worked, so I downloaded and printed the English set of rules. Explained the game to M., and after creating two new accounts, we were ready to play. M. played on her brand new tablet. I played on the laptop. Just perfect to try the game ourselves.

First thing I noticed was the artwork. When I first saw it, it somehow reminded me to Disney’s Alice in Wonderland. I don’t know why, except it just did. After taking a closer look, I thought Disney went mad! I love the artwork and the used colors. There fresh and bright, while the pictures on the cards sometimes look evil / dark. Just love it.

We liked the game, and while playing we said to each other that a digital copy of a boardgame doesn’t beat the feeling you have, when you’re rolling the dice. Holding the cards, and thinking of your next step, while you look your opponent in the eyes and your smelling the paper and wood. Bottomline to all of this. We just placed it on a shopping list, which is waiting to be filled with a copy of Bora Bora, which should be in stores any moment now.

When I first started looking into this game, I had high hopes for it.  Then, I heard that it was on the lighter side of complexity, so my hopes waned.  The artwork looked so great, and I continued to find myself drawn to the components and reviews.  Finally, a guy in my gaming group brought it, and we played a three-player game.  We all loved it, and it was precisely what I wanted it to be.

This game fired 7 Wonders for most of us.  If 7 Wonders had this level of strategic drafting and mechanics, it would be so much better.  I mean, I still really enjoy 7 Wonders, but, after playing Seasons, I have to admit it fell down a rung on the proverbial ladder.

RATING: 7
A solid, lite game that feels like a ccg, and plays in a longer timeframe. Many of the screw your neighbour cards don't feel like they fit very well, and you don't tend to see enough cards as a general rule, but enjoyable never the less.
The scoring track is awful though - this needed wheels ala Blood Bowl: Team Manager

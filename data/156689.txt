Does some interesting things that the original game didn't, but is much more confrontational than I like.  Feels unnecessary if you have the original game.

It is not bad, but it wasn't as fun as Legendary.  The spite factor was pretty neat.  I think Madam Hydra's ability takes something away.  Her "dodge" ability is better than Mariah Hill's recruiting, but her "discard a card to use" requirement minimizes her usefulness.  I found it difficult to recruit.  That could have been because of the villain groups that we chose, since I only played it once.

This comes from my review of original Marvel Legendary which gets a 10 overall. I absolutely LOVE this game. This ranking includes the rating with several expansions. I have really gotten into deck builders of late and this is the best. The amount of variety from the types of heros you can add to you deck(each hero plays completely different) to the villain decks, masterminds and schemes all combining for different experiences really makes this a fast playing, infinitely replay-able experience. The game does require some organizational skill on your part to help with set up. I also highly recommend the app that lets you randomize scenarios. Most important expansion is definitely Dark City. I also love the Villains box though this one certainly complicates the game quite a bit. Who doesnt want to play as Magneto, Venom and Ultron?

Wasn't sure if this was really gonna be a reasonable purchase, since it's not really too different from the base Legendary game.  Turns out that the base game is different enough to make it fun on it's own, but the ability to play a smash up with the original game (villains and heroes teaming up against Galactus, anyone?) makes it worth the price of admission.

Legendary in reverse...now you're the Villains taking down the pesky heroes, unless you want to mix up the Villains with the Heroes for a strange team-up. I wish it were a fraction more streamlined but at least it's not impossible.

RATING: 9
This game's greatest value is as an expansion to the original Marvel Legendary game. Unless you have a strong bias for the bad guys, I would not choose this as your first or only Marvel Legendary game. Add this to your original game, however, and you give yourself a toolbox for creating unique and compelling adventures within the Marvel Universe. That being said, remember that this is deckbuilder with few variations from the standard play style, and you will have to provide much in the way of imagination to squeeze a significant story out of it. But it is certainly thematic in the sense that you're keenly aware of this being a Marvel game rather than just a mechanical exercise, and it's not difficult to place what's happening into a thematic context. Terminology had to be adjusted to fit the new theme, and when combining the 2 base games (as almost everyone does), you have multiple names for the same types of cards and mechanisms. This is a bit of a roadblock, but other than that, it's a fast, intuitive, engaging game overall, and great for solo play!

After 17 plays, this game is climbing my rankings. Very good solitair and co op system. 

No doubt many players will like it. Both in Lore as in mechanics. Some bosses and plots are extremely difficult to win in solo mode though, but overall this series rocks and I will probably buy them all in the long run.

23 plays: upped to 9.2. Great game, great theme. Love it.

Don't like this quite as much as the normal Legendary, not sure why, it just doesn't gel the way the original does.

RATING: 7
Fun game, but I feel that this version should only be played with more experienced players.  Within two days, I played the original game with three people new the game.  All players loved the gamed, and one has purchased it for his own collection.  I then played the Villain version the next night with two who were new to the game, but who were seasoned Dominion players.  The game was punishing, and I was the only one able to do anything meaningful.   It is simply harder to play well.  I think anyone purchasing the game should start with the original set with an expansion or two.  

Also, when playing, I also feel that the games should not include too many villains that attack one another.  This slows down gameplay, and it just isn't as fun in my opinion.

This set is terrible! If it integrated better with non-villains Legendary it would be a bit better (still terrible, but better).

The playmat would be awesome if it listed the locations in the same order as original Legendary. I mean it's not hard to swap the locations in your head when doing effects concerned with specific locations, but it's not satisfying.

I play this often. Great deck building and drafting form the Marvel Legendary. I really like the characters and they are true to the comics in the way they act generally. However, being villains, they do not "work together" with their allies always. Magneto in particular is very offensive to his "partners" to gain abilities.  I love the the good guys being the Mastermind though. It all works well together. O and the the play mat is great!

Initially was less than excited, but during a lull in Hero expansions, I purchased it and was pleasantly surprised. Super fun and does merge well with the Hero-based game elements well (though keywords and terminology do create some game-master level conundrums at times, but not game-breaking). I have to hand it to UD; this was a great set.

RATING: 9
We enjoy playing this deck builder.  It could use more adversaries & commanders, and the plots are a bit lame, but the villains/allies are such fun.  Have yet to integrate it into the base game, but plenty of heroes have been guest villains ;-)

Elements such as New Recruits, the Elusive trait, and the new "henchmen" types add a great deal to gameplay.  Bindings are an improvement over wounds as they're more interesting to pass around.

Affiliations and homogenous ally pools seem more important here than in Legendary.

Similar to Marvel Legendary. New commanders (Masterminds) and plots (schemes) to play and explore.
I have played so many games of Marvel Legendary. I find it kind of annoying to play the same game with new game terms.

TRANSLATION:
-ALLY=Heroes
-COMMANDER=Mastermind
-OVERRUN=Escape

RULES NOTES AND GAME TERMS:
-ADVERSARIES:   are all enemies that are not Commanders.
-DEMOLISH:   reveal the top card of the Ally deck. Each player discards one card if able from their hand that corresponds the cost of the drawn card.
-DODGE:   discard a card with the Dodge trait from your hand to draw a replacement card.
-THROWN ARTIFACT:  when acquired goes into Discard Pile. When you play it from your hand, it stays in play until used. Then goes to the bottom of your deck.
-URU ENCHANTED WEAPONS: draw number of cards equal to Uru Enchanted Weapons. Add the Victory Point value to the Attack Value of the Adversary or Commander that you are fighting. If you lose, lose all attack this turn.
-X-TREME ATTACK:   this Adversary gets +1atk for each other Adversary in the city with the X-Treme trait in the City.

RATING: 7.5
Legendary is such a fantastic game.  The more expansions, heroes, villains, twists, masterminds, etc., the better!

This 7.5 rank is high, but it is my lowest of all Legendary reviews (not counting Aliens which I have no interest in).  

The good - like I said, more of everything.  Some cool abilities, cool combos of cards, I love Bullseye and a few more.

The mediocre - teams of heroes to defeat.  Example - the Defenders.  I'd MUCH rather have Namor and Dr. Strange and a few others as hero decks rather than as a few individual cards in a deck of multiple Defenders.  Same goes for the other hero teams.  

All the Legendary mechanics of the card decks work very well as usual, its just that it's so much more fun and more of a natural theme to have a huge selection of heroes to choose from to defeat the big villains.  Thematically, it shouldn't take Ultron and 4 other villains to take on the Avengers.  

But despite all of this, it is still a great addition.  Just not the best one. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A good edition to the fold. Sadly missing some great villains. Just pretty much reversed from the Base legendary with villains (DUH!). Yet it is fun and the scenarios are great. The solo player as well as the multiplayer is both great. High replay. Hopefully they release expansions :D

This game learned from the shortcomings of the base hero game and addressed most of those problems.  Unfortunately, this game can sometimes be a little brutal as well as it does dive a little more into the competitive side of things which can cause the players to lose a lot more often.

It’s a shame that this won’t get a big box expansion of its own.  It could definitely use it to increase options.  The one small box expansion it got is just too fringe and niche.  Instead of getting Atuma and Absorbing Man, we got very setting specific versions.  Very disappointing.  I can only hope that there is a second wave revival of this game promoting upper deck to flirt with the idea of actually giving us a Dark City type expansion with more brotherhood, gangster, and Masters of Evil options.

I dig this set quite a bit. I especially like the Henchmen and Madame Hydra basic cards. They combo well with many of your Villians, and they are very flexible in any deck which makes them worthwhile to buy when nothing else is available.

Also, the semi-coop nature of the game just feels better as the Villians.

I once introduced a friend to Legendary Marvel, and he liked it, but he wanted to play as the bad guys. So I gave him this as a gift. I'm knee-deep in Legendary, but I didn't really want to bother with Villains, so the obvious solution is to play someone else's copy.

Having played it now, I can confirm that yes, it's very much Legendary. I knocked one point off my rating for two reasons:

1) some of the new keywords, Bindings, etc. are a little wonky, making this slightly more difficult to get into than the original game; and 

2) I'd just rather play as the good guys.

I am looking forward to combining it with Secret Wars for some sweet "player as Mastermind" action.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.1
This expansion kind of ruined the game for me for awhile.  It's just mean.  The addition of cards that are mean to your teammates (remember how this is supposed to be a co-op game?) spoils the fun of forming a team of superheroes.  

There's a small improvement in that it added single use recruits for $2.  Pulled the mean cards out and put them aside.  Hoping that future game add-ons are better.

RATING: 8
Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game doesn't know exactly what it is. It's technically a coop game, but isn't really aside from the fact that the players all lose together. This is okay, but theres not many ways to interact with your opponent. Also, there really isn't much a player can do with a bad hand. Villains improves this concept immensely.

First off the "New Recruits" card adds a 2 cost one shot damage option which cycles. The new Dodge ability adds ways to mitigate bad hands. Bindings (replacing wounds) now go to the next player if there are more one.

I like the direction Upper Deck has been taking this game system. It's been taking what I love about deck building and expanding it into better games. Looking forward to their next Legendary release.

An ok set and for me treated like a really big expansion. More semi-coop which is a lot of fun in this game for me, and the characters are cool, but I like the marvel one better than villains.

Now you get to play as the villains fighting the heroes. Same game mechanics and can be used with regular Marvel Legendary.

Unfortunately not a huge amount of content for this version compared to Marvel Legendary although you can use expansions from the other game in this version.

This is a good deck building game. Great art, decent them, although I don't actually like playing the villains that much. My first play was very tough; Professor X kicked our butts good. I'm still not crazy about the semi-coop aspect, but it didn't intrude too much here.

Good stand alone game, great when added to Legendary heroes version. So many alt reality, changing loyalty, etc storylines to play! It's a much darker and more competitive version of Legendary compared to the heroes version. On it's own it is pretty tough. Combined with Legendary Heroes it really shines.

Cool twist on Legendary. The dodge mechanism allows for some cool combos, the bindings emphasize the competition between players. The higher focus on competition between the players is thematic but combined with the strong commanders it can make the game a lot tougher to win.

RATING: 8
The aggressiveness of this set is thematic and really amps up the PVP aspect of the game.  This is good and bad for me, I love the idea, but most of my plays are solo which makes a lot of the new cards less powerful and/or less interesting.  

Few other notes, the art is fantastic, the new enemies are very challenging and the new action words have changed the game enough to keep it interesting but not too much.  Overall I think you get more than your money's worth with this set, anyone who loves Legendary will likely really enjoy this set.

Worth buying just for the storage capacity of the box and the new game playmat. Villains is a fun twist on Legendary that opens up tons of new scenario possibilities.

The villain cards make this game a lot more competitive than the regular superhero version (for example you give some of your bindings aka wounds to other players rather than KOing all of them). There is one Loki card that I feel is way too luck-based (not necessarily overpowered, but sometimes it can be extremely good and other times actually a hindrance) but otherwise a pretty solid set. I love the new Dodge keyword as it allows you to recruit cheap cards without them quickly bogging down your deck, and Elusive and X-treme on the adversaries are pretty thematic.

It is limited as a solo game (unlike the heroes version) because of the take-that mechanisms that power many of the hero abilities. In a group, it seemed more difficult than the base heroes game - which stinks because if I have a group, a lot of people want to play, which makes it too difficult.

Considered a mistake by many in the community, it is not a bad expansion, but it didn't match as well as it could have with the creator's insistence of using Bindings and other Villains-only terminology that just unnecessarily complicated everything.

However, the addition of New Recruits (which led to the better Sidekicks) was a wonderful ailment to the frustration of not having anything to do with 2 recruit in a turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Play Marvel: Legendary from the villains' perspective. An interesting twist on Legendary that, from a marketing standpoint, is sure to rake in a lot more money through expansions for Upper Deck. As far as gameplay is concerned Villains is just a skin, with no new innovations.

Virtually the same game as the original, only now you play as the bad guys, and it's a more competitive game - card abilities more frequently hamper your opponents, when you get rid of wounds, you give them to other players instead of KO'ing them, etc. Deliciously fun to be evil.

Legendary 1.1  I agree with Board Game Brawl that they really could have pushed the game in a mechanically very different direction, but mostly ended up staying the same.  There are a few additions to the rules, but nothing too ground-breaking like Legendary Encounters.  I still want to own this and will definitely play, but this did not live up to its potential.

This game is superior to the original version as the developers understood the game a bit better and were able to create a better stand-alone version of the original Legendary (Marvel). The cards are full of flavor and I like having two different and interesting options to use extra buying power.

I like the idea behind this game.  First of all, for Legendary owners it is just another expansion but it is also a standalone game for anyone that doesn't have Legendary and maybe there is a market for people who prefer to play the villain.  I would still wager the majority of the buyers of this game already own Legendary.

The game is a mirror of standard Legendary.  Instead of heroes you are recruiting Marvel villains into your deck.  Instead of villains you are fighting heroes and instead of a Mastermind and Scheme you need to defeat to win the game it is a Commander and Plot.  Almost everything can be easily integrated with Legendary with a couple very small exceptions.  The Bindings in place of Wounds and Madame HYDRA in place of Maria Hill work slightly differently.

I like it as just a bunch of extra content for Legendary, I just hope my randomizer app updates for this new stuff soon.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I treated this as a big box expansion. It's ok, but since we prefer the Co-op parts of the game, we're not as fond of the villains, who tend to mess with each other's play. But all in all, it's good to have more characters in the game.

So cool new additions to the base 'Heroes' set.  Definitely some awesome new characters to play and bosses to fight.  I think the Villains set has proven thus far to not be as great for solo play as 'Heroes', which is how I play this game most often.  But not enough of a difference to rate it any different.  For all intents and purposes this is an expansion to the 'Heroes' side of things.

Legendary is a great game, this Villains set makes it far, far better. It hits all the positive marks of the core set, but improves considerably to capitalize better on it's virtues and iron out the kinks. Since it also renders most bad guys as having hero cards, and most heroes as opposition targets, you can now do good vs. evil, evil vs good, or your cross alignment teamup epic... All this and sharper rules and more streamlined cards. Its a lot of win... If you like the game prior to this, DEFINITELY spring for this box to expand it.

Deckbuilding mechanic is fun, but this game can get too back-stabby for a cooperative game, and has less appeal than a hero-centric game. Most fun with Marvel fans, but can fall flat with people not as familiar with Marvel comic-book mythos, as villains are less well-known than the heroes are.

It's another base game for the Marvel legendary series, one that seems to pretty seamlessly integrate with the other Legendary game.

Must own if you're into the legendary series.

An interesting addition to the Legendary line-up due to it being villains. Can still be combined with the others. Has a cool mat as opposed to a board. This is better than the normal Legendary base set if you prefer competitive games as there are more cards that compliment this play style.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Even villains have to let off steam once in a while, and there aren't always lackeys around for a stress-relief beating.  So boardgames can be the way to go.

I like this set, but there are an abundance of nontrivial card effects and interactions that cause long-thinking players to cogitate more slowly than you would like.

Last game, one player was so glacial that crystals oozed from her skin, and over time they filled the room and encased us in personal icebergs.  That was annoying, except that we took a break, filled up the master bathtub with water, vaulted inside, and got all floaty.

Ah, the evil memories.

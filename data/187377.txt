RATING: 5.8
This is a deck-builder where you buy cards from a number of set piles or a constantly changing display. Two things that set it apart are that some cards are buildings that don't go into your deck but form a tableau, and much of the game is about directly attacking other players. It's not a bad game, but the strategic options are limited and obvious, the card abilities are mostly simplistic, and I can't think of a reason I would ever want to play this over many more interesting deck-builders: Dominion, Clank!, Trains, Thunderstone...even Ascension, which I find on the dull side. Without the many extra KS cards or an expansion, the base card set will get old very quickly. Yes, this is one of those games where the non-KS version is seriously limited - it was utterly lame to run out of quest cards half way through the game. Dislike the art immensely, but that's personal taste.

Just received my game from kickstarter,  there are some cardsand part of an expansion missing - however its nightmare to figure out which cards are missing because there is no list of content of the cards with the rule book.  Also some of tge components has changed from the original kickstarter listing.  Wanted to send the game,  back and request a refund.  Was told by luckyduckgames to sell it on ebay.  Certainly will never ever buy a game from them again

RATING: 8
As far as deck builders go, this game is simultaneously unique and familiar. You build your deck, and a small tableau of buildings by purchasing from Odin's path (a row similar to ascension or star realms), or from set buildings and cards in stacks (much like dominion). You can also attack opponents buildings, but mostly this just nets you victory points, and doesn't ruin buildings or anything like that. As such, it's interactive without being in your face or take-that, which I love!

The engine building is simple but fairly unique, and it puts this game into the category of "deck-builder but with something more". You've seen everything this game has to offer already in games like dominion, ascension, and maybe a little bit of Race for the galaxy, but to my knowledge, no other game puts all of these things together. This game does so, and does it well. 

The variety the expansions could add might raise this rating in the future, but for now it's still an excellent game that I'd recommend trying if you like any of the other games I mentioned.

RATING: 10
I've played it twice with very different stratergies, it feels that it can develop its strategy in many different ways, which means that you can play it many times. It is quick to teach, which I think is important when you are playing with many groups. I ordered the Ultimate Edition through Kickstarter and now it feels really worth it. It needs to play a couple of times to get together different combinations through the various expansions but I have not got there yet. So I can only review the base game.
For a deck building game is really fun with great artwork and a good depth to the game.
The only drawback to the game is the quality of the cards. But with a pair of sleeves this is no problem, which I would recomend anyways if you want to save the cards as they shuffle alot.

edt. Played all the expansions and it is so good! Def in my top 10 games.

edit. After alot of plays, the only thing i find quite annoying is that the divine favors are unequal how god thay are.

This game is just awesome !!!
It brings deckbuilding to a new level. With it's townbuilding, missions and endgame bonuses.
Every game is different, because of the different strategies.

It looks very impressive, but we played with people who never played deckbuilding before and even they were convinced after 2 rounds.

RATING: 7
Somewhat like a lighter, shorter, more Euro-y version of Thunderstone which is, ultimately, more fun ... at least for me. Overall it's less of a grind and building stuff that contributes to your victory points means the game's not just about monster bashing, though fighting does look like the fastest way of making the most points.

Enjoyable deckbuilder that has a lot going on. It can certainly tingle AP players and slow to a crawl, but the player goals really help alleviate that. I love that little twist and the direction it gives you during play.

Otherwise it plays like a mashup of Dominion/Ascension/Imperial Settlers. Entertaining for sure and I'd certainly sit down to play this anytime.

I do wish the element of attacking had a little more weight behind it and wasn't so friendly to the victims, but I do understand why they went with this softer approach.

4me: Do not buy. Looks great and is fun, BUT: it is not unique enough see e.g. Ascension. With more then 2 players go for defending makes no sense as people then will attack somebody else and you do not need your defense cards anymore. So for sure points go for attacking and forget about defending, as getting attack does not hurt. That is broken the way it is.

[b]Rating based on - 5 plays, 2 player[/b]
Vikings Gone Wild is a deck building Euro style game where you are managing resources (using your gold and beer as currency) to mainly eventually buy units that can attack your opponents and score victory points off successful attacks. You can also gain points by completing missions and qualifying for end game bonues. There is a [i]lot[/i] going on in this game and I like that! With deckbuilding being one of the few mechanisms untouched in our play history I was looking for a nice one to give a try. We mostly value theme (no matter how pasted on) to get us into a game and we both love the Viking theme as well as Euro games. What could go wrong? :)

First off, the art is absolutely stellar – cute and incredibly funny. The rulebook is clear, well laid out and illustrated, with no technical jargon, and we knew exactly how to play from the get go. Graphic design is the same – clear and easy to understand. The board is large, sturdy and has a place for everything. The box (and insert) is very large for what's contained within but I'm guessing that's to leave room for future expansions. I've stayed away from deckbuilders because I am rubbish at shuffling but seriouly it wasn't too onerous as the cards are nice and slippy so they are easy to shuffle.  The wooden components (the gold bars and beer kegs) were super cute too! However, the card quality is a bit suspect - they feel a little on the flimsy side, and after only a few plays the brown edges are showing nicks. I suppose the expected thing is that you sleeve them, but not everybody likes sleeves! The game can feel a little bit long when playing to 40 points so sometimes we play to 30, but even then it has a tendency to feel somewhat repetitive.

Overall I found it fun even if I didn't enjoy the deckbuilding mechanic particularly. Gameplay was fun when you bought cards and attacked things! :devil: Everything else was...fine...it just seems like you spend time building something that doesn't really end up doing what you want and that's kind of annoying. Like if I see my opponent buying a lot of attack cards and I buy a lot of defense cards, then that's great! What's not so great is that they attack me and I have nothing in my hand to defend myself, then all my defense cards come out later when they have no attack cards and I have to discard my hand as useless. What a waste! Seems like you should be able to use those cards for [i]some[/i]thing. If this is how deckbuilders work then they shouldn't be taken too seriously. Very expensive game not to take seriously though...We've also played the It's a Kind of Magic expansion. More of the same, but mixes it up in a fun way with units like the Sorceress and the new Sorceress Tower building. Needs expansions for variety.

All in all, it was a really light, fun introduction to deckbuilding. I don't know that I would chase after any [i]other[/i] deckbuilders but it might be fun to compare this and Clank! to see how they stack up. I suspect that this would be the better game for 2 players though, as the board in Clank! seems quite open and it doesn't look very exciting with just 2. Hanging on to it for the present...

Very much like Dominion, but just not that good. What makes it different from Dominion are the battles, two currencies (instead of one), the buildings and the slower game play. However, the excitement peaks towards the end game, which is good. I also kinda liked that the victory points are visible. The last couple of rounds (if your deck is quite big), you don't have not so much to go for (since you know that you will not get the purchased cards back on hand), so you simply just buy (or attack) whatever written on the mission cards and end-game score cards. In our game, the combos of these cards made the last couple of rounds quite boring and given.

Jópofa, hangulatos deckbuilder. A grafikák nagyon szépek. A fő újítás, hogy alapvetően egymást kell támadni, ráadásul úgy, hogy ez inkább előnyös a megtámadott félnek is. Illetve mindenféle pool kombinál. Van random, de játék alatt fix, állandóan változó, háromból választós, gyakorlatilag minden. A hangulatát tudnám kiemelni, mert mechanikailag nem éreztem olyat, ami kiemelné a mezőnyből. A menet közbeni és végpontozó kártyák különösen imbák / tervezhetetlenek.

Całkiem nieźle oddany duch gry na Androida, lekka i przyjemna, całkiem długa i satysfakcjonująca. Raczej nastawiona na interakcję między graczami czyt. atakowanie wiosek, ale niekoniecznie. Podoba mi się, że oddany został motyw atakowania wioski jedynie na zasadzie kradzieży surowców i punktów, nie całkowitego niszczenia. Myślę, że wymaga grania z dodatkami, wersja podstawowa może się szybko ograć; trochę mały wybór zadań do wykonania. Chętnie zagram więcej z rozszerzeniami - sama podstawka nie zawiera np. nektaru czy Czarodziejek.

It would've been a '6' hadn't it been so INSANELY long.  The players' moves take forever.  You feel nothing but a sheer exhaustion after the game, just like after a hard work.

There is just too much crammed into the design: Dominion-style deck building, Ascension-style deck building, personal tableaux consisting of buildings with production/storage/other capabilities, raids (and defenses) against other players, super-cards to be earned in specific circumstances, common goals scored at the end, personal goals to be fulfilled on the fly…  Whoaaa…  It just cannot be fun.

The game would benefit greatly from getting streamlined.  Dominion is streamlined, Ascension likewise and so are all other deck-builders.  Packing everything possible in the deck-building design is not the way to go… [shakes his head]

 - I like the concept of this game, and its aesthetics, however it leaves me wanting a bit more.
 - I'm not a big fan of deck-builders though. Trains is probably my favourite, despite its dry theme.
 - I think I prefer games where deck building is just a part of it, not the dominant mechanic.
 - I really like how you can buy buildings which are permanent, so much so that I focus on this every game because it's the only part that interests me.
 - I like how the attacking doesn't really disadvantage the attacked, however it doesn't feel very thematic and it seems a much stronger strategy than defense.
 - End game scoring is a bit of an anti-climax as the only thing that's left to the end are the bonuses which are for the most part fairly obvious as to who's going to win them.
 - My friends liked it significantly more than me. I'm open to playing it some more, but it's not my kind of game.

We got a demo of this from the Designer at BGG Spring Con. Not a bad game and the art is great, plus they have the interplayer attacks designed very well - they give the attacker points, but do not destroy much of the defender, so it isn't an aggressive attacking game. However there was too much luck in it for a 90 minute game for me. (Others in the demo group loved the game.)

A twist on the deckbuilding genre which uses two resources types and tableau building. The game suffers a long of downtime between turns, which can be very long due to the attacks. Also strange that there are no card trashing effects in the base game.

I had a blast playing this 1v1.
There is a lot of content and strategy in this game. 
I decided to play without the expansions and kickstarter cards (so we played just the core game), as it was the first time we played it, so we wanted to keep it simple and the card-count down. The game did not seem thin nor unfinished due to this, and I cannot wait to play it with all the extras :) (Which will be included one expo at a time...)

Jópofa hangulatú deckbuilding, de szerintem feleslegesen sok elemből áll. Itt is a kevesebb több lett volna, de persze ez nagyrészt ízlés kérdése. Viszont eléggé olyan érzete volt, hogy aki elhúz, azt már nem nagyon érik utol. Pl. aki célkártyákból többet teljesít, minden bizonnyal több pontot is kap közben, de a végén még végpontozásban is visz hat pontot emiatt. Hát nem tudom. Hangulatos, érdekes, de annyi jobb van...

Smooth playing deckbuilder with quite a bit of interaction as the most important source of points is attacking other players' buildings. Don't mind playing this, but it offers nothing that we haven't seen before. A typical KS: transferring a well known mechanism into a new theme, however lacking anything new or original.

RATING: 8
Nice looking, easy to get into deck-builder with Vikings building up and attacking one another.  Attacking has risks and isn't harsh on the victim, which is good.  Plays a little longer than you would initially think, but it's enjoyable the whole time so that's no big deal.  Fun game.

I love deck-builders and this is a really fun one. This game is easy to pick up and start playing, the rule book is laid out amazingly well. I have the Ultimate Edition but I have not tried any of the expansions yet because the base game gives you enough to enjoy for quite a while. Definitely worth picking up if you are at all interested in deck-builders.

I've heard some call this Imperial Settlers: The Deck Building Game, and I think that's a fair assessment. You are indeed building a deck, but you're also building a town of buildings that interact with each other. Opponents can attack your buildings, but sometimes their resources are better used elsewhere.

I like that this game combines a lot of common tropes for deck-building games into a single experience, but it all feels very ho-hum. Vikings Gone Wild is total fluff. There's nothing here that's new or noteworthy. Worse yet, there are very few cards you won't see from game to game. Some variation on the building types available would have gone a long ways towards giving this game some replay value. As it is, this is a very simple deck builder without anything all that interesting to write home about. The viking theme barely shines through at all (This game is about the furthest thing from going "wild"), and the mechanisms just aren't that enthralling. Definitely a skippable title, in my opinion, though it's not bad for a play or two if you see someone with a copy somewhere.

Great solid game that will include a diversive group of gamers. Its easy to teach and get up and going. Setup time is nominal. My biggest complaint would be non standard card sizes so sleeves are tough to find. Any card game that needs to shuffle your cards should have an easy to obtain common sleeve type that you will be able to find at your local hobby store. This game has multiple setup options and cards so there is a good amount of replayability.

Finally able to play this out with my wife yesterday, and we were very pleasantly surprised! Setup takes a little time, but who cares, it's fun. It has the card grabbing ability from Xenoshyft and also a deck of cards from the top you can buy, so there's multiple ways to build your deck. And the fact that you can grow your city, along with having buildings produce even more resources on top of what's in your deck is crazy! You can get rich so quickly! 

I don't understand why people are complaining about attacking. You get VP for successfully attacking and successfully defending. It sounds to me like some people were playing wrong because unlike most deckbuilders, you don't discard your remaining hand until everyone is done with their turn, and not until the end phase. So you can still have multiple cards remaining in your hand, and not just a defense card. It's a good way of psyching a would-be attacker out. And you can only be attacked once per round, so it's very fair. I think it's a great idea that's clearly been playtested multiple times until they concluded with this. 10 stars for a great experience.

Rating is a bit ambiguous as it's based on 1 play with 4 players, and one of the players suffers from AP, which made it took far too long. So it was sort of the wrong choice of game for the wrong number (I wouldn't play Dominion with 4 neither) and wrong person.

then again: how many deckbuilders do you need in your collection? This game didn't have something I haven't seen before somewhere. And the owner of the game said you really need the expansions to have enough variability as otherwise it becomes boring after a while. That's not really something positive.

Deckbuilder themed like How to Train Your Dragon. Have to balance (or specialize?) fighting, shields, gold, and beer. Card choices are buildings, fighting/shield actions, (lightening) actions, and bonus actions. Seemed different than other d.b. maybe because more player interaction (by fighting, defending, and stealing)? Or because of the ways you get vp is not from the cards themselves!

I backed this game early in the Kickstarter Campaign.  It arrived last week and I have been playing it non-stop.  My gaming group at work is continuously vying for a position at the table to play this game.  "I love this game" is the unanimous cry from those that have had the opportunity to play.  Each time playing is different.  In-game and post-game goals can be arrived at in a number of ways. The mechanic of deck building and resource management is fun, simple, thematic.  I highly recommend buying this game if you don't already have it.

After the first game today I have to say it's a definite solid 8!!!
The interactions between the players are great in the game I played.
What I do like in the game, is that despite you are playing against the other players, you don't really cripple the economy and you still have some sort of natural flow throughout the game.
The main aim for attacking buildings is gaining victory points and not necessarily damage your opponents economy.
One other fact I like is that you can't gang up against one player. 

Still need to play more games!!!!!!!!!!

RATING: 8
Man, in terms of a straight out of the box, stand alone set Deckbuilder? Most fun I've ever had. What a fantastic game... They mix elements of an engine builder into the formula to add some strategy back in where it's lost do to a lack of deck culling (Which an Engine/Deck Builder game is basically just missing a drafting element to go 3 for 3 on my favorite game features). It's so good it's biggest issue is one for the developers, not for we the consumers... basically the Guild Wars and Magic expansions aren't worth buying... the core game is so perfected, there wasn't anything to add... Guild Wars makes the game crowded and only works optimally in 2v2 4 player, and the Magic expansion actually requires you to substitute it for attack or defense cards because there's so little room for it. 

So rather than chomp at the bit for the newest expansion, the core set is all you need... Great value, all told, but... a bit sad I only see myself replaying it so many times since it will never change much... even if it's because it's great as is.

RATING: 5
First play impression: This game is pure greatness.

A pretty simple deckbuilder (which makes it easy to just pick up and play) with a couple of twists. First is the buildings. You can buy buildings that stay in play and give you permanent bonuses. This is a nice change from your average deckbuilder where you always just hope to draw the right combo. As the game goes on not only does your deck get stronger, but you have more buildings giving you guaranteed resources each turn.

One of the best things about the game is the resource conversion. There are two main resources in the game, beer and gold, and you can exchange one for the other at a 2:1 ratio at any time. This is great because it means you're never locked out of getting something you need. Draw a handful of beer when you really need to buy a gold building? Just convert it all to gold.

There are only a couple of slight drawbacks that I've noticed so far. One is that turns can take a long time. This is in part because of the conversion system. There's so much to do on a turn and you sometimes need to take several actions, with several conversions, to do a big combo. It can feel good to pull off a big combo and get just the right thing on your turn, but it can take some time.

Another possible issue is the defense cards. If someone attacks one of your buildings then you can play defense cards to try to block it. This is fine, but on a turn where you don't get attacked then any defense cards you drew are just wasted card draws. Attack cards, on the other hand, are always useful because there are different things to attack. Defense cards are just too situational. I feel like they should give you points when you buy them, or they should be able to be converted or used in some additional way to make them more worthwhile.

The last thing is the "Draw x cards" cards that you can get. There aren't a lot of these, so it seems like whoever gets one or more of them will be at an advantage because they get more cards and can cycle through their deck faster.

So far the game is great fun. Will have to see how my possible drawbacks play out after more plays.

This is my first deck building game, and while I did get the ultimate edition with all the expansions, I've only played this using the base game. So this review is of the base edition only.

I found overall the game was a lot of fun. The mechanics were well explained within the rules, and it wasn't long until me and my partner (who is not big into board games) were having a lot of fun. The 'Odin Path' cards added a fun bit of challenge as we both tried to get the cards we wanted before they left the board. The battle mechanic again are simple, but well designed so you can't just gang up on one person. (Not relevant for 2 player, but for bigger groups this will help.)

The art is very cute and cartoonish, and the quality of the components is very high, especially the wooden gold and beer tokens. I find my partner is keen to play this with me, so this is probably a good game for when you have less experienced people over for games. 

As a new player to deckbuilders, I don't know how this stacks up against other games of this type. From what I understand of other games , the mechanics seem to be quite basic. So again this may be one for newer players to deckbuilders, rather than more experienced players.

We played 4 player and loved it right off. Tried one of the expansions but lots yet to explore. Plenty of replayability. Building engine is slightly reminiscent of Imperial Settlers and there is deck building as well as ways of getting one off cards.  Works very well and very enjoyable. Definitely a KS I am glad I backed

pretty cool though deck building is not my favourite type of games.
But the illustrations are extremely cool and you have many ways to win, so it has a high replayability
too much downtime too unfortunately

This game is something special.  It's a hodge podge of simple mechanisms from other games, but somehow they all come together to create a really fun and fast-paced game here.  Little bit of deck building, little bit of engine building, little bit of card bluffing, efficiency and objectives.  It's good fun!

It's great theme, I love art, and how the game looks and feels, but on the other side I have played many deck-building games, and this one is just bad in my opinion. Worst part is that after you have played all your cards, you have to wait till the end of the turn to draw new hand of cards. If you have none then you can just watch as yor opponent is ridding you... I am not sure why creators resign from "standard" rules, that when you finish your turn just draw new hand.

Very solid deck/tableau builder. I was worried about the silly theme but this game is great fun. Easy to learn and teach. Components and art as good. Pretty light and cards dont seem balanced but overall it's a lot of fun.

Quick deck builder with a viking theme. Players are able to attack each other, but that is for scoring points, not destroying anything.

Wow! This is a fun game. Different decisions to choose from to pick a strategy to try and win. The art work is great. I am going to sleeve my cards, they chip easily. I want to try the expansions when they come out.

RATING: N/A
Highly interactive tongue-and-cheek deck builder card game.  Incorporates some Thunderstone in the market to recruit heroes with beer, buy buildings (limited by the level of your hall) or defenses with coin.  Fight monsters and claim booty from the path of Odin.  Coordinate your turns to earn addictive video-game style achievements that start simple and grow progressively more challenging.  Direct overall strategy towards the end game goal cards.  Lots of humor in the cards, situations, and rules.  The best and unique part is the opportunity to attack or claim for spoils almost everything that your opponents control (of course this goes both ways!).

I like deck builders and I like this game.
The only real issue I have with the game is I feel that it lacks a good variety of units/cards. Certain things from the expansions "Guild Wars" and "It's a Kind of Magic" should have been included with the base set eg walls and flying units to make it more interesting. Decent without but solid with these expansions.

Looks like an awesome little deck builder. Tons of direct conflict, points are scored by attacking other players (though you're not damaging what they're building just scoring points, and they have cards they can defend with).

-- Found out that another half of the game was made exclusive. Pass on this unless it's a thrift shop find.

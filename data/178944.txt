- too much luck.
- "The calendar mechanics" is totally a joke. Way too random.
- very low strategy.
- its like you got 1/20 of what game description said
- except from extremely cool figures. I see an a little lower then average game with bad implement of mechanics. 
- i'm not a fan of Hyperborea, but it far better then this game.

Is a pretty good game. Unfortunately It can be a bit long and people tend to distract a lot. Also I haven't really played enough to talk over the game balance and mechanics, but from where I stand the game looks very in-depth and very strategic. Every choice counts and consequences can be quite severe I one is to overlook important deck basics. the RNG factor is up and running, but I don't think it's the leading role, which is really good. Most of the time you have quite a lot of good moves, even if the oracle is not on your side. One thing I think needs some reconsideration is the mulligan. I'd make it (in fact I plan to experiment with it) draw six cards, instead of draw 5. No cohorts is severe enough punishment. Another thing I would like to see is some sort of buff on the defending player. I know about tents and city power, but still if you don't have two, three active tents the attacking player will usually roll over you with cohort of 5 or above giving him enough cards to overpower you ( which happens consistently in the mid-late game)

Battalia is an interesting game, combining deckbuilding and battling on a map.
There is a tile-laying aspect, also, when players build the map on the board using square cards.
The production is good, with pretty artwork and nice miniatures, but the graphic design looks a bit amateurish (confused and so tiny...).
The first game was compelling, but a little long and exhausting. Need more plays for a correct evaluation...

4 player game is long. There is a way to make it last a little bit less, but still this is a minus.
But. Tha artwork is amazing. The gameflow is smooth and addictive, mechanics which are from different games are combined to form a very good game. This game brings a lot of fun and brain burning at the same time. Every 4 of us admitted game length but everyone were eager to play more. It's definitely deserves to be on many gamers' shelves.

Didn't like it very much. Neat idea, but the card hand got clunky very fast. You have to focus heavily on what to get, so this is less of a deck builder, but more a deck streamliner.
Combat with other players doesn't really happen.
But very nice art!

After my fist time playing this I was sold. The deckbuilding mechanics are amazing, and the artwork is even better. I didn't really enjoy the areacontrol part of the game as much on the first play, I think we simply took to long buiding up our decks before we even startet on this part, but in subsequent plays I have really startet enjoying that as well, and I am really looking forward to actually getting the rules to the hero sheets and the unbound buff, since I think they will add even more to this part of the game. 
I see some people complaing that the sun orcale is too random, but I don't see that at all. It goes in a set pattern, so you can always predict what's gonna happen. Sure you still need to have the card in question, but guess what, this game has an awesome mechanic to increase your chance of this happening. Ambush and tents. this brings me to another great part about this game. Many deckbuilders like dominion treats getting rid of unwanted cards as a hassle. You need a certain card to trash another card. In Battalia it is not only easy to get rid of a card you no longer need, but you actually get a bones for doing so. Got a title on your hand a turn too early? No problem, just trash one of those supply cards you got too many of anyways, and the problem is solved. If you plan this correctly, and with a little luck, you should be able to take advantage of the sun orcale no problem. In fact I recommend using tents all the time, they are really realy good artefacts.

The only bad thing I have to say about the game is that the endgame can drag out quite a bit. Even after it becomes clear who will win, it can still take quite a while before that happens. I do however think this will become less of a problem the more you play it, but only time will tell.

Good first impression! This game is full of eye candy!
Beautiful art and solid components. Overall very good pieces and components. This is a game that attracts just for it's presentation!

Still have to learn advanced rules, but the first games were fun and there's a lot of strategy and dept here! Will keep playing to learn more and more!
Also, the first time with this game can take a bit because you need to learn how to prepare the board and study all the rules. There's a significant improvement from 1st to 2nd time you play it in both time and execution!
This will probably be a lesser issue when the website is up with the video tutorial and extra scenarios!

Some very cool ideas her with multiple currencies and a way to both upgrade and slim down your deck (it is a deck building game at it's core). I also like that you build up the map and found cities and so on.

The problem is that it takes way too long to play and that you gain very little from actually fighting your opponents. Sure you can chase them away for a turn or two (or more if you're lucky) but not really worth anything unless you win by it and it's not even exciting. You just plunk down some cards and compare strength. Much time for very little effect.

A truly amazing game. My first game of the kind ( deck building and more). Amazing art. For a casual gamer like me ( most of the games I own take up to 30 minutes to play) the fact that I spare the time to play it (so far it is more than two hours for a four-players game) only shows the real awesomeness of the game. Did I mention the AMAZING art??? And I bet that I have only scratched the surface of the gameplay...

Very good game with beautiful artwork.  At first the rules are daunting but they are well thought out and simple in actual application.  My only qualm with them is a lot of the terms make it more confusing than necessary.  For example ambush cards going to limbo.  I'd rather it said removed from the game.  Would be clearer.  Or calling the discard pile your shelter.  Thematic sure but confusing your first time playing.  That said the rulebook is very well done/laid out

Pros:
* Well balanced system with a bit of luck.  Wanting to prioritize a color also pushes you into different strategies each game as you will slightly favor stacks that match your color (or what you have in hand)
*  Great concept/art/theme
*  Lots of viable strategies.
*  Great storage/protection for minis in box

Cons:
* Takes a bit to setup.  Wish the box came with a divider/insert to speed this up.  In general this game could have benefited alot from a good insert.
* Battle is complicated for what ends up being just highest score wins... but it works very well.
*  Not a lot of ways to hinder opponents short of buying cards in their color and using them to ambush(which in turn clutters/slows you down) or map tiles they need.  By the time you can directly confront each other the snowball might have rolled too far.

Still... minus the need of an insert I think the cons are legitimate design choices that make sense and fit the game.  Look forward to more play throughs and the eventual expansions.

TLDR: I have chucked this in my kickstarter flop pile and wasn't willing to throw more cash at the expansion to potentially make it good as the base game itself is not very good. 

I backed this on kickstarter, played it a couple times, and it felt like a mess in the end. Lots of interesting ideas, good quality components, some interesting interactions, and interesting combination of mechanics. However, in the end all the interesting parts don't come together in a cohesive nor fun fashion. I wanted to like this game, but it just wasn't a good game in my opinion.

I have heard the expansion makes this game better/good, but I wasn't willing to throw more money at it, as the base game didn't feel worth the money I spent on it in the first place.

Sokkal deckbuilderebb, mint amire számítottam, ami nem baj. Itt egyáltalán nem mellékszál ez a mechanika, mint mondjuk egy lewis és clarkban, majdhogynem táblá dominionnal mondanám. Elsőre kicsit nehéz volt átlátni a lapok ára miatt, ami itt nagyon meg van kavarva. Maga a játéka múgy nem annyira nehéz, mint amilyennek elsőre tűnhet, elég jól játszatja magát, ami ritka bonyolultabb ks-es daraboknál. Egyértelműen ügyesen lett streamline-osítva. Külön tetszett a sok opció a húzás szórásának az enyhítésére, illetve az, hogy ugyan van agresszió a játékban, de elég nehéz azért tényleg elvenni valamit a másiktól. A lehetőség adott, de komolyan meg kell küzdeni érte.

RATING: 4
+ Good material
+ Game works
- Way too long
- Overcomplicated
- Useless calender mechanic, makes game too lucky
- Very luck based, if you constantly get cards of your color, you are lucky. Otherwise you should change them later, which needs time and others can power up.
- Extrem slow gameplay, especially from beginning to late mid-game
- Boring to watch others play till end-game.
- Bad graphics on streets and citys -- hard to differentiate
- If you hold your hand, you can either see the symbol of the card (up left) or the strength (up right). Would be better to bring both on the upper left corner. In addition you have to lay down your cards from right to left instead of intuitively from left to right. Bad design.

Game would need a lot of streamlining. I won't play it again. Too much time for too less gameplay.

For all the hype I expected something exceptional, got something I can't force myself to play. The component quality is great, art is mostly good, but the game is obviously targeted at the people that have some love for Carcassonne and deckbuilders. Also the "fast paced" is sometimes nearing a 2-3 hours session according to some of the players around me (my own experience is not enough to comment).

Honestly, half of the 10s coming from my countrymen are there just because it's one of the few titles with Bulgarian origin and I don't think these are fair representation of their opinions, more like support for the local publisher.

I'm often rating with like/don't like (lower than 4 or 9-10, with this game 5.5 to 6.5 is fairer (some pros and cons, not my type of game), and I'll keep the rating in the neutral zone.

RATING: 3
An overly complicated game that is essentially a deckbuilder with added luck and kingmaker elements. The "calendar" mechanic is a wheel that randomly makes one card more powerful during a round and another card easier to buy.  So if you happen to have drawn the card that is more powerful (and can use it) you get a bonus or if you happen to be buying the card that is easy to buy you get a bonus.  Due to the complex resource system you typically can only buy one or two different cards on your turn (depending on what you drew) so your choice is either buy that or not.

The map is very basic -- you just build roads to the neutral cities to take them over and hope other players don't kingmake against you by building in your direction or attacking your cities.  I would recommend they make a variant without the map, however the map is the only means players have to interact with each other and the only possible interaction is, choose a player and go attack their city, or try and take the neutral city that someone is going for before they can get it.

There is a more advanced game mode where the color of the map tiles matters somehow, which I haven't played, but honestly I'm not too excited.  Essentially each player wants cards of a particular color, and when you buy a card it is randomly one color, so if you happen to be able to buy your own color that is a big bonus, but if you can't then you either buy the off color and try to change it later or you don't buy it at all.

The game also takes forever and if one player gets ahead it tends to snowball (slowly) so the players who are behind can end up sitting around for hours.  Attacking the lead player's cities is difficult and there is no way to make their deck worse, so the "balance through kingmaking" mechanic (which I hate) does not even seem to be particularly effective in this game.

Unlike other deckbuilders you play with the same cards every game.  Once you get the basic strategy, most of the variety will come in how lucky you get due to what you draw and how much the calendar favors your plays/buys.

It's not all bad however.

The most innovative mechanic in the game is the "ambush" mechanic.  This built-in ability allows you to trash cards in your hand every turn which lets you thin your deck at will, while also saving cards for your next hand. Most of the strategy of the game revolves around effectively using this mechanic.

The art is amazing.  Probably the prettiest game I've ever played.  Excellent figures and components.  You will want a very large table to play this game.

The game has awesome production quality and the artwork is insane! The gameplay is interesting and provides lots of options, but here's the downside of the game - it gets too slow if you play with people that like to keep planning for the future turns. Also, if you have no swords and the swords run out, the others can crush you and it is very hard to come back in the game.

generic fantasy setting, remedied by the gorgeous card art. The four factions play way too similar.

Mage Knight Lite Edition. Offers the same puzzle of how to use your hand of cards by taking risks (with bravery and efficiency) in order to control your deck, and to truly earn your growing power.

I love the thematic nature of the choices in the game. If you concentrate too much on the nobles and titles, then you will no longer have basic workers (frimen) to do your dirty jobs like road building. Every choice that benefits you in one way hurts you in another way. It often feels like a game of cutting your own wrists to succeed. This is magical. 

The ambush-mechanism is extremely powerful and raw, in a good way. Many of the card combos make you feel powerful in a joyful way.

Finally, this game, more than any other, is extremely malleable to house-ruling the initial and end game conditions. There is no problem speeding up or slowing the game as desired. For example, setting a time-limit on the game works absolutely fine.

Very compelling and emergent gameplay! Big thumbs up. It was much more varied and clever in practice than one would have thought merely from video reviews. Special thanks for the well-written rulebook!

Hmm, 7.8 rating here so far.. WTH? Is it that all Kickstarter games just rake up a nice rating based on their campaign hype and then once games arrive, people do not adjust it anymore?

In my view, the game advertises great game mechanics (deck building, area control, hero movement, calendar, nice thematic factions etc.) but just brings an utterly confusing mess of them. It feels like they just wanted to throw as many "cool sounding" and currently en-vogue game mechanics into one game, but to make it even playable had to dull each and every one of the down to a level where none of them are left with any actual meaning for the game. 

Best example is the deck building, which takes away any and all potential options of actually playing the game yourself (as in making choices and deciding about trade-offs) by simply forcing players to collect certain colours. These colours are unrelated to any of the hinted themes in game and within the colours everything is actually the same, killing all potential for a thematic fit. Is another play collecting the same colour as you (there are four colours and four players...) for 1-2 rounds before you both realize, well bad for you both, you are both out of the game.

The calendar also feels like it adds nothing but randomness and complexity to the game that does not really influence player choices. It seems to be there just as an added annoyance.

Rules take quite a while to read and explain - which I don't mind for a good game - but the game that you get out of it just feels broken, boring and a waste of time. Just to be clear: I do not shy away from complex games (I love Twilight Imperium just to set the compass here), but any complexity in a game needs to add fun and options for the players. None of which seems to exist in this game.

I also dislike the artwork, but that is a personal preference issue.

Outstanding game. I have never seen such an amazing art in a game. You can feel the awesomeness of the art not only on the main box, but also in every single play card or miniature, you play with. 

The gameplay is flawless and mind catching. The depth of the game changes while you get better and better. A whole set of strategies open in time and you can never guess the winner right to the very end. 

Strongly recommend it! So far my personal favorite.

Nem lenne rossz játék, ha nem lenne nagyon hosszú! Ez vele a fő probléma, szabálymagyarázat nélkül 4 óra volt négy személlyel. Ami azért problémás, mert lesz hozzá kiegészítő, amivel már akár hatan is lehet vele játszani.
Ki tudja, hogy annyi fővel meddig tarthat?!

Alapvetően Dominion klón, csak itt táblán még több akcióval  kell számolnunk. Tehát alapvetően kártyaépítős, de mégis annál jóval összetettebb és persze hosszabb is, ahogy előbb írtam. Ami még zavaró egy kicsit, hogy az amúgy szép grafikájú kártyákon nincs segítség a váltásokkal kapcsolatban.

Art and figurines look awesome and will keep your attention for a long while, but there's very little strategy behind them, too many random mechanics and factors that shouldn't be present on such a resource-building game.

Great game that adds deck building, tile management and combat.  
Pros: excellent gameplay. No junk cards.  Several paths to win. 
Cons: square cards (can't sleeve them), air and water tiles are too similar in color so it's hard at a glance to tell them apart.  New players will take a while to get familiar with the game so new games will take some extra time to play.

Lovely art. Truly; wonderful card art, nice minis. Unfortunately, that's doesn't cancel out the insanely dull gameplay. Its a deck-builder where 90% of what you do is try to build up combos of resources. Hard to figure out how to get anywhere. Constantly have to look things up since there is no text on the cards. Sooo many piles of cards to buy from, and yet so little difference in them.

Deckbuilding with fighting on the board.  We played with what I understand to be the basic rules, and there were still lots of little non-intuitive rules to remember.  Icons are too small, and the board and cards are extremely busy looking, which made my eyes very tired.   

Card play felt a little awkward but at least thematic.  You need enough supply cards to reach the location you want to go.  You need a sword card to start a fight.  Scupts are detailed and beautiful.  

Game play was very long at over 2 hours even with the basic rules and we were all ready for it to end when it did. 

Not my normal style of game, but I am glad I gave it a try.  I think it will be a near miss for its target audience.

A unique combination of deck building and area control.
None of the different mechanisms seem out of place. Every card is useful, every move you make significant.
Careful trimming of your deck is needed in order to survive end-game battles, while keeping a minimum of Supplies to get your heroes back on board or to build the final tile on the board to end the game at the right moment.

You may have a hand of zero combat value late in the game, and if your opponents strike at that moment, you may lose several of your hard-earned cities! 
The authors call this: "You will find also an element of bluffing, when you fight your battles, so put the poker face on and be ready to outsmart your opponent", but it can ruin the game experience if not prepared for that, because you may not recover from that blow.

This game was appreciated by *every* member of our gaming group, which is a rare thing,..

Finally a deck of cards with no text on it, so that the artwork can be appreciated fully. Great idea to take the standard square format of 7cmx7cm, although the position of the icons may be illogical to some.
I did sleeve all the cards because I thought they were rather flimsy.

Negatives? Maybe the long playing time, or the substantial tablespace you need.
The jury is still out on the impact of luck in this game...

What to say about "Battalia the Creation".

 It is what i personally experienced to be my first own board-game. Must admit, i am not particularly good at it at the moment but still the game is a ton of fun.
 As I had my copy around Christmas 2015 i had just about 10 rounds with my friends from Fantasmagoria and school.
To be honest i was intimidated by the sheer amount of rules in the beginning, but after my first game everything clicked' and i began to experience the game with a more in-depth understanding of the different strategies.

Battalia offers great variety of playing styles. Competitive and yet constructive, you are always weighing down the opportunities, constantly rethinking your decisions and since the game is made in such a way the a dynamic pace of the game is continuously evolving.

Of-course as i am part of the artist team, this more or less renders my comment to be bias.
And though my sincere remark toward the game is genuine i kindly advise you to give it a try.
You will love it I am sure ! :)

Happy new year everybody!
Be victorious!

interesting basic idea, fast pace at the beginning of the game, nice components.
After half game the rhytm slows down as everyone needs to manage a lot of cards every turn.

Very nice art. Too complicated for what it is. Cumbersome square cards. It's hard to remember to pick the wheel card for each warrior card you get. It takes too much space. Set up and tear down are too long.

Well played now 2 times, a two-player game and i must say it's the best deckbuilding game imo i played so far. 
lot's of choices to make, different playstile possibilities.

Simply a solid fun deckbuilding game.

Deck building is slow and nothing special about it. Board playing is boring and seems forced. There are other games with deck build + map that do it much better.

Most of the graphics is very, very good. Only thing I didn't like is that terrains of air (yellow) people are blue and very similar to water (blue) people. It's a bit confusing.

Battalia incorporates a lot of common mechanics (deck-building, map-building, unit movement, card-upgrading) to create a game that’s completely unique and not (in my opinion) unnecessarily complex. Everyone starts with a basic deck of 10 cards and their own unique faction. In the standard game, the factions are identical to each other, but you'll want to recruit cards of your faction color whenever possible. Unlike a standard deck-builder where you recruit cards with some kind of currency cost, in Battalia you recruit cards by symbol combos. For example, a lord requires five supplies, a title recruits a lord and two frimen, etc. Building the map and recruiting your heroes requires card combos as well. Building a level 1 city takes three frimen, building a road takes a supply and one or two frimen depending on how many branches you want in the road. This leads to a very interesting game since you want to recruit cards with your future actions in mind, treating your cards as recipe components. 

Some of the cards also have a strength value for use in battle against other players or neutral cities. Despite the importance of all the cards, the only way to score VP in Battalia is by building, upgrading, and conquering cities with your two hero figures. While you’ll want to upgrade your cities, a paranoia will set in about whether you’re just doing your enemies’ work for them. It’s not difficult to swoop in and conquer another player’s city, which people WILL do. The world of Battalia is not simply big enough to all the players. The game ends when one player reaches a certain number of level 4 cities or the map is completely full. 

We were super impressed with this game. It’s a smart combination of strategy and tactics where players need to both think about their future plans as well as deal with the current state of the map and their current hand of cards. We played the standard (i.e. not advanced) version of the game with 2P. We’re looking forward to trying the advanced soon.

What a surprise! I didn´t expect it to be as good as it turned out to be. Yes, it is a little long - and yes, it suggests a different kind of excitement. However, it does develop a very unique feel, which I did enjoy quite a bit.

- Great combination of deckbuilding and area control. 
- It's feels like a big optimalisation puzzle (eurogame) with some direct interaction on the board. 
- This is a Great system  for much more scenario's and expensions!
- Top graphics design and top quality gameitems!

What i miss (played once with two):
- To long for me, drags on (also with two). 
- To much eurogame (optimalisation) feeling for me.
- I miss some direct interaction with the cards.
- The battle mechanisme is to simple.

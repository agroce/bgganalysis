Fantastic fast paste legacy eurogame that evokes the best of Agricola without the slow pace and long setup time in a legacy format.

RATING: 5
Final thoughts after the campaign : I can't see why this game is getting so much hype.  The gameplay is quite shallow, the story is non-existent and the unlocking doesn't do enough to spice up the game.  I enjoyed the experience of playing this because of the players I played with, but the game itself isn't nearly good enough to justify the time commitment.  Why this is a 'legacy' game is beyond me.

Also, I found the game gets very repetitive.  I had a decent engine where I was hitting the same few spots over and over.  I won 5 of 6 games from games 3-8 in the campaign, but got bored with it and decided to mix things up.  Of course the player who ended up winning got one of the cards I chose to give up and had been milking for lots of points!

In the end, this didn't offer enough of what I want out of a legacy experience.  The game didn't offer a strong enough story, good surprises, or enough strategic depth.  I'm clearly in the minority here since Charterstone is shooting up the rankings...

Played with at 2 players, mid campaign. Really fun to open all the boxes and construct the city :) Art is cute, story is a bit light (lighter than pandemic legacy), but the worker placement element is well done and many different variations are introduced along the way.
You do get jealous sometime, when an other player unlock something cool...

Game 1 in the books. Giving it an 8 due to anticipation for game 2, but as far as Worker placements go its likely around a 6 or 7 if that was where it stopped. But with 11 more games left I've very excited about where the game might go. Already had 1 unexpected loop thrown in. This 8 may go up yet, and it may take the spot for my favourite game.

Rating as of three games: so far, this has not been anything special. The Automa seems more complicated than I want (in a two player game) and otherwise it's sort of a boring worker placement game where I have to stop and read a bunch of rules after some actions. I've heard the game gets better later on, but for now, it's only moderately interesting.

A neat worker placement game with a legacy story to it. My biggest complaint about the game is that the tie breaker for anything is simply a die roll. After a really tight race for the entire game, it's a really unsatisfying feeling to win or lose the tie because of a damn die roll. I understand you want to emphasize the importance of the Charterstone (thematically the die), but it just cheapens the feeling. I really wish they would have done something more interesting like stating what the tiebreaker for a particular game would be on the Guidepost; this would have allowed it to change every game and not be determined by a dumb die roll. Otherwise, the whole campaign was quite enjoyable; the story was well written and was far better than anything found in Near and Far, new mechanisms were unlocked rather organically, and the gameplay as a whole was smooth and interesting. Really looking forward to seeing how this plays now that the story has been completed.

I loved it! Unique. Legacy games are so cool, and I felt justified spending my money on this particular legacy game because once you played through your 12 games of the legacy part, it becomes your own unique, customized worker placement game. The artwork was amazing and the rules were well written. Definitely worth it. Also brilliant to have made a recharge package with the original board game supporting it. Overall so well done and I had a lot of fun playing it!

Charterstone is a worker placement legacy game.  Only two games in.  Interesting so far... we'll see how long it holds my attention.

Edit - In game three we had a situation where a player who with no chance of winning, made a decision at the end of the game that put the player who was in last place into first place.  It was a random swing that made the hour long game pointless.

A fantastic Legacy experience. The worker placement starts out incredibly light and grows gradually more complex as you build your own board. Decisions quickly become more and more meaningful, and I've found myself trying to imagine strategies that span across multiple games. This is also one of the few games my group has played and then immediately set up for another play.

Love it! And the great art and components certainly don't hurt either.

Early rating.  Putting it this high because after muffing some plays during our second game, I have been thinking about it for a week - that's not common.  A lot of that is likely due to the legacy aspect, since those bad moves may come back to haunt me later on.

--- 

After 5 games (4-player), impressed by the overall balance, though not sure what the impact of narrow victories will be at the end of the campaign, other than the printed VP differential.  Often it seems like someone has a broken engine that will leave the rest of the field behind, but by the end of the game scoring tends to be closer.  

Still thinking about the game between sessions and looking for ways we can get more games in.  Still a 9.

Wow, this is a brilliant design! Our group of 5 players is two games in and the flow of this game is superb. Some of the rules in the German edition are a bit hard to understand, which led to minor mistakes for game two, but the overall experience was very good. Don't expect a deep story, though - this is a euro game through and through, but the mechanics work perfectly so far!What I like best is the game's pace even with 5 players - very rare to have a euro that works well and remains fast-paced with higher player counts.

no spoilers in this comment. My rating is currently based on 4 games. The game starts off super simple, but it ramps up each game a good bit. I would call this game 'interesting'. I don't know if I'd qualify it by the traditional definition I think of when I call something 'good', which is to say a well designed standard board game experience, but this goes beyond that, it's just really fun and fascinating. Like, even if at the end of 12 games, I sit down to play a game and it turns out to not be a 'great' board game by comparison to others in my collection, that doesn't matter. What matters is that, here, at game 4, I'm having a blast by just uncovering and creating a game. Whether or not that game is 'good' is almost irrelevant. 

So my review of the actual game: pretty smart fairly medium weight (so far) worker placement game with little new mechanics aside from some cool small features that come in later (so far). In the end, it's very much a get stuff to pay for stuff to get stuff kind of game. If I were to hold it on gameplay alone, I probably wouldn't put it up there with any list of favorite worker placement games and I don't think that really matters because it may not be the point. After the end of the game, I'll let you know what I think when I play it in it's final form, but as I said, nearly irrelevant.

2 games into the campaign and can't wait to play the next one! As evident in other player comments, you need to read cards very carefully to avoid mistakes and missing instructions.  It all seems to be there, but if you're in a hurry, you'll miss some key elements.  That's why 9 out of 10. 

Now 8 games in and it keeps getting better! I thought one campaign would be enough, but went ahead and bought the Recharge Pack because my wife enjoyed the two games she got to play sitting in for someone else.

An unexpected Christmas gift has become a surprise gaming delight to share with a few buddies. We love our heavy euros, but this clever, entertaining worker placement in the legacy-style is uncomplicated fun. This experience crushes the hypola machine that was Pandemic: Legacy. That rinse-and-repeat co-op puzzle was a desert of banality. This on the other hand, though not a life-changer, is definitely in the spirit of a night of light gaming with friends. Zero chin-stroking and tons of fun. Thanks Jenn!

Post game 7 update:
I'm becoming more and more impressed with the design as I play. There are respectable comments about balance which I suspect may partly have something to do with the 'fog of unknown' in the game. Decisions are made without the benefit of predicting the future randomness. This is PRECISELY what I'm enjoying most about my personal play as well as those of my three other Charterstone neighbours. I definitely would like to play the campaign again with a different charter and explore the decision space from a whole different perspective. It continues to be an interesting and enjoyable gaming experience. 

Post game 11 update:
The game continues to offer surprises and twists while we are all comfortable and familiar with what we want to do in the context of the game state. I'm looking forward to the conclusion and the secrets it may unlock in the final play.

Very nice worker placement game with the added legacy features being a nice bonus.  Quick to pickup as the rules start out simple and are added as you learn.

Great first 3 plays. Decent depth even in game 1 which was a surprise. Slight frustration with following the 'maze' of rules printed on stickers, in the rulebook, and the criticality of following all the microtext printed on the bottom in the throwaway portion of the cards. Otherwise though, we are already 1/.4 of the way done and loving how it is playing so far.

Really enjoyed games 4 & 8. Multiple paths to victory to explore. Really didn't enjoy game 10 as there was too much of a gap between me and Sarah (28p to 59p).

As we are playing we are completely ignoring the story as we know that the story will not appeal (we have watched spoiler reviews). A few of the components have had to be altered, mainly by just changing their names, to make them fit in with the adjusted story that we are playing.

For us, the game play has been very enjoyable and making up our own story has been fun.

"Worker Placement for Dummies." I'm sorry, but I don't want to have to play a game several times, for several hours, until it finally (might) start to get interesting. The two-player experience sucks, even after multiple games, because you never bump each other and there are simply not enough interesting locations on the board. 

In theory, the Automa work nicely as a way to get more buildings out, but in practice, they don't build them nearly as quickly as they should. It's also incredibly annoying and frustrating to have to spend three whole turns to get 2 resources (take good, take another good, retrieve workers) while watching the Automa have way more exciting turns than you, going to the Cloud Port, putting out buildings, gaining reputation, and scoring mega points for free on nearly every turn. Managing the Automa is fiddly and tedious, as is the constant need to keep placing stickers on the board and in the rulebook  (even before beginning the first game).

I frankly cannot understand the hype and high ratings for this extremely mediocre, overpriced Legacy failure. The worst part is that we were rewarded with our $60 purchase by having to throw the barely-played game into the recycling bin because it's worthless and unsellable. My biggest disappointment of 2017.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ CAMPAIGN GAMES: Good worker placement game with a small engine-building aspect to it in each game but also from games to games.
++ CAMPAIGN GAMES: Good theme that is pretty well used in the game mechanisms.
++ ALL GAMES: Great art! This game has a funny art style (building looking like what they do).
++ ALL GAMES: Great components! The board has a nice matte finish, the wooden components are nice, the cards are thick, the stickers are great and even the scratch cards are of great quality (easy to scratch).
++ CAMPAIGN GAMES: Great game "insert" system which hold everything in an orderly fashion: Each player have it's own Charter chest to store the component that will follow them from game to game and the Index box is great (sturdy and it have a magnetic flap!).
++ CAMPAIGN GAMES: There is a Recharge pack available for this game (which is useful to replay another campaign if we want).


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- CAMPAIGN GAMES: The game flow is hard to keep constant with all these crates being opened all the time (even though it's great to open more crates, it's drawback is that it disrupt the gameplay).
-- ALL GAMES: The game takes a lot of table space, so it would be hard to play this game beyond 4 players on a normal kitchen table.

I've never played anything like this before. Don't read further if you don't like spoilers because I might list some. There's a bunch of boxes you can't open so you have no idea what is inside them. They're a bunch of cards that feels strange and we realize that most of the cards are stickers. You're adding stickers to the rule books as you go and that is how you learn. You're adding stickers to the board as you go and that is how you create your land. You write all over things and you keep your things after the first game so that when you're playing the second game everything starts out a little bit differently. So if you've never played anything like this before it seems very intimidating and I recommend you get on the Charterstone Facebook page because the creator of the game will answer your questions almost immediately as you are playing. And if he's not available, there's usually someone there who will help out.

Campaign was interesting. Some games were better, some worse than others; depending on guideposts balancing can be a very big issue. Appeal of playing on after the campaign is rather small; there are still things to unlock, but they are nothing new, and there are plenty f other worker placeement games that are plain better.
If someone would ask me to join in a campaign(bring a recharge pack, that would be ok, but I wouldn't be the recharge pack myself.

fully complete now, and I think a 7 is where it deserves to be.
The initial joy at legacy reveals, especially the big one, were a great experience.  However, once that was done with the story was very “meh” and left a pretty uninspiring worker placement game behind

There is so much more discovery in this game than any other Legacy game I've played. I absolutely love the art, the story, the components, and the gameplay (especially after about Game 4). There are a couple certain story element that was disappointing and affected how I looked at the earlier games. Also, because the designer wanted to avoid user error and production mistakes, the Legacy content is grouped together. While it is elegantly produced, the unlocking of crates felt clunky. I wish this could have been a game of 100+ actual crates and envelopes to unlock. I'd pay 100$ for that! Most importantly, now I have a unique Euro game that I can play again and again. And it's not just a vanilla Euro. This thing is strategic and fun!

Starts off very simple, but it looks like it's blossoming into something great. Doesn't really work with 2 (the reputation track race is especially uninteresting), so I greatly appreciate the Automa rules.

RATING: 8
Wow. Not the greatest game of all time like I was hoping it would be, but as a worker-placement game it's very very competent. The legacy aspect is fun but unnecessary at times (particularly what concerns with the simplest of rules that you are forced to "discover" and stick to the rulebook).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
After one play the game is quite fun. It is very simple and easy to learn. There is a true feel of progression as you unlock new "crates" and gain new cards. Unsure if racing to crates will give another player an advantage or not but given the way points are calculated it may be possible. Overall a good legacy game that I actually don't mind playing. Generally don't like playing legacy games.

no spoilers! i’ve played 5 games so far with 2 players and no automa and i’ve had a wonderful time watching our game evolve and i really can’t wait to see what kind of changes are still to come. i’m actually thinking it’d be best with more than 2 players and we will definitely be adding an “automa” to at least one of the uncontrolled charters. i’m also really glad i got a recharge pack because i honestly want to play again (and again and again?). is it crazy that i kinda want to get another whole package? maybe, but i’m really enjoying thinking about all the possibilities this game has to offer.

The first game isn't especially inspiring, and the possibility for imbalance does exist stretching through game 2. If you miss a game (come in late, etc.) it can take 1-2 games to catch up again, but it is possible. The story is very engaging starting around game 3 and it always keeps you wanting to play more. This game is often just as much fun to lose as it is to win.

RATING: 6.2
Just finished the 12 part campaign last night (2 players). We were both pretty underwhelmed with the game to be candid. It was "ok", but nothing to really write home about. Gorgeous production values and components, so top notch on that front. But the gameplay itself was pretty sub-par for a Euro Worker placement type game. My gaming group (of which myself and one of the key members did this campaign on our own), are huge fans of Scythe and Viticulture.  Charterstone was kind of a swing and a miss for us though.. Oh well..

RATING: 9
A great experience, we really love this game. We just ran our fifth game and we already talk about the possibility to buy the box to replay the campaign with others. We are playing this campaign with only two players and no bot. Even this way we find it so cool. I cannot set a 10 because sometimes we are hesitating on some rules when discovering them.

It’s a lot of fun, but creates the funny situation of having players feeling like they’re playing badly but winning, or playing well and losing. Despite this, the setting is great, the approach to slowly(ish) learning the rules works well, and the story is surprisingly good. By making the “crates” a list of cards rather than an actual box, there is scope for a lot more legacy-style unlocking than in most similar games. It can be a bit much though. Playing with Annie, James and Immy. Five games in after a single weekend playing.

RATING: 8
This is the first legacy game that appealed to me enough to spend money on one.  And now that I've finished the campaign, I am happy that I did.  It was 12 sessions, or roughly 15-18 hours of pure, engaging, interactive entertainment among friends for about $50.  You'd be hard-pressed to find any other form of entertainment that delivers so much for only about $3 an hour.

We made mistakes, and there were mild frustrations.  But they didn't prevent me from enjoying and looking forward to each and every session.  And now that the campaign is over, it's a legit worker placement game (a la point salad) which has potential to shake things up each time you play...and has successfully done so in each of my post-campaign solo plays.

As it turns out, something compelled me to purchase the recharge pack along with the game.  I doubt I would have purchased it post-campaign--mostly due to now having knowledge of everything the game will offer, but also due to the fact that I am going to have a difficult time getting another group to commit.  But since I have it, I am looking forward to playing the campaign again in the future.

Now that I have finished a campaign of Charterstone, I can say that I really enjoyed the experience!  It was exciting to play each game as you anticipate new secrets to be discovered, some of which are quite surprising.  The mechanisms start off very simple, and the game grows with more complexity as you go.  It is a decent worker placement (WP) game with some clever mechanisms (other Stonemaier games such as Viticulture are better WP).  Due to the unlocking nature of the game, the game plays very different depending on the number of players.  A game with 4 players will unlock components much quicker than a game of 2 players.  We played mostly 2 players through our campaign and we didn't unlock some mechanisms that others unlocked several games before us.  Charterstone is not a perfect game, but it a fun experience and one that I have really enjoyed playing.  As far as future post-campaign plays go, I am not sure how good the game will be; only time will tell.

This worker placement Legacy game is lots of fun and builds up quickly. Games take longer as you progress and more choices become available. I like the progression of this game and the rules aren't too complicated. There isn't much of a story but it's exciting to see want is next. I'm not a big fan of not really knowing what will score at the end of the game round but otherwise this is highly recommended if you like worker placement games.

Not your standard legacy game, you create a game unique to you that you can play after the main campaign, I think this should quiet all the people who complain about the legacy mechanic, which I think is a brilliant way to teach a game and add rules slowly for any level of gamer.  The game is just not my thing, primarily worker placement and was a little bored by the middle of the campaign.  Traded.

Love the idea of a positive legacy where you are building rather than destroying. So far enjoying it but would possibly want longer with each new rule/component added to really get a feel for it, by the time we get our heads round 1, another is revealed. Feels a little like a long tutorial rather than 12 clear games (so far) but still really enjoying getting it out and seeing what comes next. Most looking forward to playing it after the campaign is done.

RATING: 6.99
That is one rough first game. So many stickers before the game even starts, and all sequential -  unnecessary. Instead, there is stuff on the player ('charter') boxes that is not explained - THAT should have been stickers, added to the boxes once it became relevant. We kept thinking we were missing rules, only to discover later we were not. Except when we were. A game-one player aid would have helped. Also, *after* game two - So now that you know how to play, let's screw that up for you: The auto rules kick-in, but they are optional, so you should use them if you want - except you don't know what they are or how they work, so just use them or not, randomly? And now there's rules about stuff you keep between games - which would have been nice to know about at the end of game one. So three games in, you kind of know what your doing, but if you had known earlier... (Oh, and you only get 9 more games total).

Pre-ordered for [b]Essen[/b] pickup.

Gorgeous, charming although light and very shallow worker placement game that unfolds itself and grows and evolves after the series of sessions during a campaign. With time it is becoming more complex, more fun, more vivid and more delightful. This is the Stonemaier game I enjoy the most up to date.

The prosperous Kingdom of Greengully, ruled for centuries by the Forever King, has issued a decree to its citizens to colonize the vast lands beyond its borders. In an effort to start a new village, the Forever King has selected 6 citizens for the task, each of whom has a unique set of skills they use to build their charter.

In Charterstone, a competitive legacy game, players construct buildings and inhabit a shared village. Building stickers are removed from cards and permanently added to your charter on the board, becoming action spaces for any player to use. Thus, a few available buildings soon grow into a bustling village with dozens of actions.

Your journey through Charterstone's many secrets will last 12 games, but it doesn't end there. Your completed village will be a one-of-a-kind, variable worker-placement game.

This is a pass for me.  While I like legacy games, and have also liked Viticulture and Scythe from the same designer, it comes out in a similar timeframe as Pandemic Legacy season 2 and I don't game enough to support 2 legacy games at the same time.  

In addition, I've got worker placement games that I already enjoy (Viticulture)  so I don't need to take a chance at a new one.

I will say that having the board be doublesided and selling a Recharge pack to with reusable components is a great idea that lets you have 2 campaigns going on.

The expectation of a developement of the game/story comes with the purchase. It developes, yes, but it's an unengaging story, and quite laborous to do the stuff you're told: Open this, scratch that, paste this, read that. Less a game, but more of an activity. The price/quality is about right, but as an activity it's not very fun. I'll rather drink a beer and have a conversation with my buddies than this. Maybe my 9 year old would have enjoyed it, but her English is not there yet. The gameplay is quite OK, just as Frieses 504 is OK, but it's not enough to justify the effort you have to put into the story. If you prefer gameplay over story, you should stay away and play something else. If you prefer story over gameplay, read a book.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is a medium complexity worker placement game that doesn't really do anything novel in terms of what each rule or component does but the way the story unfolds and offers a unique path through the campaign is what makes it special. Unlocking new content is exciting as you try to make the most of it. The fact that you can play the finished campaign as a permanent game afterwards is the icing on the cake, and then if you want the cherry on top you can get the recharge pack and play through the whole campaign again.

A very neat legacy game about building a town using lots of cool card combinations and worker placement. The production is gorgeous and the story is full of fun surprises and has a great sense of humor, but the best part is that the game is still fully playable and fun even after the legacy campaign. The board can even continue to change somewhat in the regular game, and the board is double sided to let you replay the campaign if you buy a recharge pack.

I highly appreciate the hard work that was necessary to create the game.  

The first third of our campaign was great: much to discover and nice little add-ons from game to game. Rating 8

The second third introduced more of everything but no significant improvements. Still enjoyable. Rating 7

The last third of the campaign was rather dull. Everybody had developed some kind of standard strategy so the games become pretty repetitive. Rating 6

All in all: a decent experience but as a legacy game no match for Pandemic.

The clear standard of the market seems to be that if you take a pedestrian euro worker-placement game, strip some of its features so as to introduce them piecemeal, make the overall victory conditions opaque, and render the rules difficult to parse because they're scattered over dozens of stickers, you've got a hit.

I am on the fence when it comes to "Legacy" type games.  Not a fan of modifying the game board, but Charterstone has a double sided board, so a side that you would not "change".  Interesting approach... I may be tempted.

After seeing a full page of '10's with no explanation as to why they rate the game a '10', other than "to balance the stupid 1's", and then reading the commented '1' rating from the French gentleman who went out of his way to ensure he didn't spoil the game, I tend to prefer his overall perspective, since he completed the campaign, yet rated it a '1'.

RATING: 7
Not a bad game overall, with good gameplay and "leveling" through the legacy system.
The only problem that I can see is that the different chapters aren't balanced, and this hurts this game more than any non-legacy game. To make this a bit worse, the catch-up mechanic stops being relevant for the second half of the game.

Pros:
# Great artwork
# Smooth gameplay
# Some interesting new ideas.

Cons:
# An easy winning strategy for one village which just completely trashes this game.

This game is fundamentally broken for competitive plays. Even SeaFall is better in balancing the gameplay (and it's horrible as well).

According to The Dice Tower it's not the best legacy game out there, but it's a very solid Euro game with legacy aspects. One session can be played in reasonable time, it is replayable after you are finished with the campaign. I planned to put together a group of 4: me, Evka, Jakub and Zuzka to play it over 12 sessions. Let me add rating once we get into the game.

Wonderful game. I'm a huge fan of legacy and this is easily my favorite legacy game. Plays so much faster than Gloomhaven (and is a more optimistic setting!). The collaborative we-are-all-building-a-city-together is more compelling to me than Pandemic. Lots of fun with opening new buildings, naming characters and placing stickers!

THESE COMMENTS CONTAIN SPOILERS

2 games in, I felt pleasantly invested in my character and her iron-mining activities (8/10)

4 games in, I am having doubts whether legacy games are for me - My sub-optimal play in the earlier games seem to hinder future progress.  In a non-legacy game, this would be encouragement to try new strategies and do better.  In this, I suspect I am now just along for the ride without a possibility of winning (7/10)

6 games in, my character is dead and now will be playing as a 'spectre'.  My options seem even more limited than they were in the first few games and I'm being given a single 'spectre' mechanic to reduce how much further my character falls behind (6/10)

8 games in, and I'm still a spectre doing the same resource-VP; money-VP exchange routines and then spending far too long looking at cards for their special powers which may or may not give me an extra VP for various things.  The number of cards and little bonuses require something like a spreadsheet to track them all.

10 games in I have a playsheet so I can better track all the little bonuses that cards are giving me.  Play remains much the same.  I think may reached my gaming tolerance for manufacturing and selling iron.  And still a spectre.

All 12 games played - what was that all about?- I didn't enjoy story and the end wsa very unsatifying.  The passing resources on to the next game mechanic was an interesting consideration.  I would like to play the game properly now that we have all the rules and the "story" is done with.

Played two games. The first was much too simple to really be interesting, but by game two, things were really starting to happen.

Love the legacy aspect and the discovery of new "secrets" in the game. Still, core gameplay is basically using workers to gain resources and converting those resources to something closer to VP's. For how many games will that be fun? Also, if all the new stuff in game 2 is any indication, I fear a little that the game will quickly become *too* complex for my tastes. Who needs 30 different buildings with slightly different effects?

But for now it's enjoyable enough.

Easy to see what they were trying to do; an epic village-building Legacy game. But the rules and gameplay are a mess, even when presented to you one at a time. Some strange design choices and balance issues mean that the game is more admin and remembering triggers than creating a meaningful (or fun) gameplay experience.

It does contain an unbelievable amount of content but unfortunately not at its best in a 2-player campaign. The Automa would have helped, I imagine, but if you advertise a 2-6 player game, you want the 2 player experience to be as robust as the 3-6 player experience.

1-6 players. City building/worker placement campaign. Each player owns and operates a charter -a section of the city- which produces a different commodity and is responsible for expanding that charter. 

Charterstone is a legacy game, in which new rules and components are introduced each game and there is a story that is told, which is dependent on player choices.

This game is ok, unfortunately I feel like I have to play 15 mediocre games to get to the real vision of the designer. There are some early rules issues, due to the way the game introduces you to itself.

I think in the end it'll be a fine game, but I'm not sure I'll want to play it again after the 15 plays, which makes me wonder why not just make the game it's final state and let folks enjoy it.

After 3 plays, this is only a solid 6 for me.   Great artwork in its own way.  Pretty to look st and well produced.  

The rules, however, leave much to be dissed for a legacy style game, and the legacy element does not really contribute to the narrative unless you really work to make that happen.  

Still going to try and finish it out, but so far, this is the first Legacy-style game that has left me underwhelmed.  

Update:   After 5 plays, we felt the game opened up a good bit and was much more fun, overall.  Also, (veeeery minor spoiler comment follows) some of the legacy elements came more into focus for us, making for a better experience.  Upping this to a 7 with the hopes that it continues to improve!

The main difference I feel between this and the Pandemic Legacy games is this. In Pandemic it’s all about the journey. Although you can play a custom version of Pandemic with your finished game, the desire to do this is not great. Charterstone is more about the destination, you are building a unique game that when it is finished will be infinitely replayable.

THIS IS NOT A WORKER PLACEMENT GAME!!! It is really just a marriage between being a PARTY game and the notion of worker placement since there is not really any vying for space - someone just gets their pawn back.  It's great playing with friends and family with lots of  laughing and figuring out rules  just to see how things progress and the opening of boxes and stickers and naming characters and all the falderal.  As a pure worker placement game it would be very poor as it is incredibly tiresome and themeless indeed and I almost want each game to end just to see what is next rather than go through the drudgery of opening boxes and building not-so-great buildings and more people etc.   All the players are essentially doing the same thing in the same way and the end scoring makes victories or losses seem almost unimportant.  Sometimes it takes like 4 turns just to produce a few resources  and convert into a coin or two or a few points- the direction of the game is rarely strategic - just do what you want on any turn and if you get tired of that go to the cloud port.

Just finished the campaign with a few friends.  Another solid title from Jamey Stegmaier and a worthy addition to the Legacy style family.  The gameplay and mechanics evolve through the campaign, which keeps each game fresh and interesting.  Also, having a double-sided board and the ability to play your own unique board AFTER the campaign really sets the game apart from other Legacy titles.  Definitely the next evolution of the genre.  I'm interesting to see where this takes the community moving forward.

Just finished the 12 game with 6 players.  It was my first legacy game experience.  The initial few games were a lot of fun, but I felt the game became less interesting as time went on.  I also did not feel like the choices we made were that important.  With the exception of a few guideposts, everything in the index got put into play.  I don’t feel like anything new would be unveiled on a second play through.

The overall winner was a surprise.  That might be a pro for some people, but our group seemed turned off by it.

RATING: 3
Unlocking is not bad, though very uninteresting overall, gameplay only a 2/10 on BGG scale. Very open worker placement makes for little tension, I expected a light game but there are really very few *interesting* decision points. Gameplay length has gotten better each game but from a turn to turn point of view the micro turns feel slow as you only get a tiny action each time. You do stuff, slowly get things, do a big thing, repeat. Quite possibly the blandest game in terms of gameplay I’ve played in a while, of it didn’t have the unlocking aspect it would be a 2.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I love all the fun novelty of the legacy aspects of this game, but this will probably be the first Stegmaier that doesn't end up with a place in our library. Like the Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket Charterstone starts strong until you realize all roads lead to the same repetitive place. I like it, but I don't love it. I hope it surprises me in the few games to come.

Simply put, the best boardgaming experience I've ever had. Elegant, tightly balanced euro with wonderful hybrid thematic elements and attractive, high-quality, colorful components and art. The legacy implementation is outstanding, making each game different, and gradually ramping up the strategic depth and difficulty of the game. This is the first time I've ever played a game FOUR TIMES back-to-back (for 5.5 hours straight) and did NOT want to stop - I felt no mental fatigue, just excitement for the next game. This game does everything right: aesthetic, strategy (with minimal luck), replayability/variability, balance, and theme. 

Suggestions: This game plays best with 4 OR MORE players. We played with 4, which was fine, but we felt that there could have been a bit more competition/tension with a higher player count. If I recharge this game, I want to try with the full 6.

Listen to the Harvest Moon soundtrack while playing!

Probably more of a 7-7.5 when it comes to replay after the campaign is over, but while the campaign is going, it's a fun ride.  Simple, evolving, worker placement game with gradually introduced mechanics and a few semi-novelties (minions, assistants/friends, etc.)  Lighter than I usually go for, but still enough depth for competitive hardcore gamers.  The campaign was a bit long and could have ended after 10 games instead of 12 without taking away from the experience, but it was enjoyable.

Ein Legacy Worker-Placement.
Darum möchte ich auch gar nichts spoilern.
So viel: Wenn jemand das noch spielen will, beisst euch durch die erten beiden "Tutorial" Runden durch, das Dritte wird besser ;).

Partien 4+5 haben mir deutlich mehr zugesagt, als die ersten Beiden.

Spiel 6: Halbzeit. Bereits sechs Spiele haben wir gespielt. Die ersten Zwei wahren zum Einlernen eher ein Kampf, weil ständig Neues hinzu kam und der Spielfluss gestört wurde. Spiel 3 bis 5 machten viel Spaß, da es ein bisschen Neues gab. Spiel 6 plätscherte eher so vor sich hin, weil sich kaum etwas veränderte und man seine feste Strategie hatte, wie man einigermaßen gut vorwärts kommt.

RATING: 1
Unplayable. Awful. Severely Overrated. I play-tested this and it was the worst gaming experience I have ever had. It was like torture. So boring. Turns were all railroaded. Added “legacy” content just adds useless cards, characters and overly complicated rules. A bloated and poor attempt to force "legacy" onto a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
After game 1 and 2 I'm very keen to play the rest of the campaign. 8/10

Update: following session 2 and games 3 and 4 I'm starting to lose interest. My early decisions seem to have left me with a less powerful charter and others are racing ahead. I still don't seem to have grasped any kind of strategy for playing and the whole thing is starting to get somewhat repetitive and dull. 6/10

Update: just finished game 6 and I've mentally checked out at this stage. Last place in both games by a substantial margin. I still don't really know what I'm trying to achieve and find it very difficult to compete with 5 players who have cards that drive their strategy. At 6 players waiting for a turn takes ages and when it arrives my next two turns are either planned in advance to very little gain or I have no moves or I need to return workers and hand back to the others so they can rack up yet more points. Other players have powers that let them avoid this so get to have more turns. Now my character n the story is "dead" and I've lost all interest in the game. 4/10

Better than expected! A lot of fun. Love it so far. Really like the worker placement ressource gathering concept and love the legacy aspect and development of the village.

Like always the rules of legacy games are a little bit fiddly and you have to read very very carefully!! But beside that I'm enjoying the journey a lot.

The artwork is stunning and the components are excellent. Can't wait to play it more.

RATING: 1
One rules mistake can not only cost you to lose a single game, but it can make sure you will forever be behind for 12 games. One rule was missed, now I have to play behind for 11 games. I even won the first game. But I was so far behind it has been impossible to come back. At the end of game 4 I'm so far behind that even if they gave me the points from the remaining 6 games (meaning I get 7 wins) I'd still be lose. I know missing a rule isn't the designers fault, but making a game where missing a rule once cost you 15 hours of fun is.

RATING: 10
Great game (but not a great legacy game)
First of: The story (or the legacy) itself is not the center of the game! 

The game makes you "design" your own boardgame over 12 plays. You get new rules and new buildings to add to the game. You choose positions and so on. 
And I really love this aspect! You make your own game which you can then play as often as you like. There are also some other specializations but I dont want to spoiler too much here.

The game itself is a basic worker placement game. And it is a good one. It has some important decision making and lets you specialize in a field of your choosing.

The artwork is awesome. And the quality of the pieces is great (metal coins!)

i like it vastly more than pandemic legacy 
i like that the cards seem to be replaceable for more plays
its still a legacy game though and still has the player count problem

interested to see how it works after the campaign is done

why have it legacy, why have stickers?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The stickers are very cool, I sure liked that part.  But what feels like prescribed actions with no time or opportunity to determine anything other than a very shallow strategy quickly becomes frustrating.  The game is basically telling us what to do, and so we do it, and so it goes.  Ultimately:  a mundane theme with mundane mechanics.  Those stickers though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.95
I loved the mechanics of buildings being stickers you place on the board and then the leftover card is still in play as a crate that will unlock more buildings for you to build later. It really doesn't matter what you build because everything will even out in the end anyway. Everyone has access to all buildings at all times. The components are great except for one spoiler component in tuckbox i (i think). My one critique is the story is not as intriguing as say Pandemic Legacy S1.

Dieses Legacy-Spiel hat uns ab der ersten Sekunde absolut geflasht! Nicht nur durch die tolle Graphik, sondern auch durch den eingängigen Grundmechanismus. Man entdeckt mit jedem Spiel neue Aspekte und ist nur gespannt, was denn als nächstes kommt.

RATING: 7
So far we've only played game 1. We'll see how this develops.

After playing game 2 and 3:

It's still fun and enjoyable, but i miss the heavier interaction that happened in game 1 strategy - putting down more resource buildings means that there's less motivation for people to place workers in areas where a previous worker already exists.

Also, the amount of power that minions and advancement cards have seems to be drastically huge in a way that feels like it should be more incremental, thus creating a lot of imbalance for random reasons.

Regardless, still enjoying immensely, downgrading my rating from 9 to 8.

A group of four experienced gamers set out to tackle this. The rules-discovery nature of the game makes it extremely difficult to know if you've missed something, which as it turned out at the end of the first game, we had. We also didn't discover something important in the second game. 

It's a real shame that the UX so fatally and fundamentally flawed in this way. The art is beautiful, top notch components as I would expect from Stonemaier Games, and it's obvious that a lot of time has gone into this, but when rules get lost so easily that you start to doubt if you're playing it right ("If we missed that thing, then what else have we missed?!") it has big problems.

A cool legacy experience.
Super disappointing ending.

Plagued with the issue of trying to introduce the game gradually as you play it.
So far it has not worked in any game I've tried, even the FastForward games are much worse off because of this. Figuring out rules as you play is always inferior as you have to figure out details live when when playing the game.

For a few basic things in the game we never saw core rules of until 3-4 games after the feature was expected to be used properly. Might have been our fault, but that's what you get with introducing rules as you go and no complete rules book to use.

There are a lot of weird things in the game, and when playing it as a 2p experience (no automatas), unlocking things became funky. A lot of things were referenced before we unlocked it, there was an unbalance to the order of unlocking some things and semi-exclusivity of features not "belonging" to your charter.

There was a huge imbalance in completing the objectives and who decided which path to pick. For some missions this could result in a 30p swing, where in others it was pre-determined. Basically you had no idea when to shoot highly for the Guideposts.

Il m'est difficile d'énumérer tous les pourquoi du comment sans spoiler le jeu, du coup je pose cet avis en me basant sur les principes du mode Legacy et de la mécanique du jeu. Cet avis ne contient pas de spoiler. :)

Charterstone n'est pas un jeu d'une grande complexité, il est vraiment très très léger et partirait dans la catégorie Familial mais le prix du jeu n'est pas très familial (70€).
Côté gameplay qu'est-ce que ça donne? 
Charterstone n'a de Legacy que le nom... malheureusement le narratif est au point mort alors que ceci devrait être un point fort pour un Legacy. Ce jeu est plutôt un tutoriel de 12 parties reprenant une mécanique de jeu classique: pose d'ouvriers avec un peu de gestion.

Un gameplay de pose d'ouvriers sans contrainte (on espérait dans les futures parties qu'il y en aurait.....) on peut aller partout sans qu'un autre joueur nous gène, on pose on prend une dite ressources, on se pose ailleurs et dépense la dite ressource, le plus souvent c'est pour soit construire ou pour des points de victoire le jeu étant qu'une salade de points de victoire... Bref c'est trèèès long et gnian gnian! Pas d’interaction.

Les éléments à débloquer sont toujours pareils...sauf un qui j'avoue nous a surpris mais dont l'utilité était pour ainsi dire inutile ou peu éclairante. D'autres éléments de jeu portent des noms qui pouvaient présager que dans le futur il pourrait se passer des choses, des rebondissements.... ben non il ne se passe rien! :( 
Autre point négatif: les règles qui ne sont pas toujours claires, certaines tournures de phrases sont ambigus et donc sujettent à interprétation. 

Lors des deux premières parties on était assez enthousiaste et donc on se réjouissait de la suite mais dès la troisième et ce jusqu'à la 12ème (la campagne se jouant en 12 parties) il n'y a eu réellement aucune évolution, les parties se succèdent dans une répétitivité lassante et la campagne est d'un ennui mortel. La douzième et dernière partie fut également le clou du spectacle et il en résulte d'un grand Plouf final!! 
Une fois la campagne terminée vous pouvez continuer de jouer comme à un jeu classique, vous ne jetterez aucun matériel si ce n'est certaine carte devenue inutile. 

Alors justement après 12 parties qu'est-ce que cela donne comme jeu? Un jeu de pose d'ouvriers des plus médiocre et ennuyant qu'il soit...

Le matériel de jeu est de bonne facture mais pas non plus abondant, je trouve que le jeu est cher pour son contenu final.

Personnellement je n'attendais rien de Charterstone mais tout de même quand on voit les jeux de Jamey Stegmaier on se dit qu'il sait faire de bons jeux, Scythe par exemple. Par contre je pense qu'il s'est un peu planté en catégorisant Charterstone en Legacy. Un Legacy ce n'est pas que coller des autocollants et ouvrir des petites boîtes, c'est un jeu qui se doit d'être évolutif après chaque partie et être narratif...

En conclusion:
- Si vous souhaitez un jeu Legacy je vous conseille très fortement Pandemic Legacy Saison 2 (je l'ai commencé et waouh quel jeu!) et si l'anglais ne vous rebute pas: Gloomhaven (une pépite!).

- Si vous souhaitez un jeu de pose d'ouvriers avec gestion: Anachrony (pour le même prix et avec un contenu 4x supérieur à Charterstone), Near and Far (très narratif), Manhattan Project: Energy Empire, L'Âge de Pierre, etc...

My first legacy game. The story building aspect of this game is interesting and intriguing. Every play-through has a king directed goal and the consequences of fulfilling or not fulfilling that goal have an impact later down the line. The players have a lot of input on how they want to run their story. 
As far as game mechanics go, it's a rather uninspiring worker placement game. You gain access to location upgrades over time and a few new units, but overall it's the same euro-style game that you've played before. Still, if you enjoy those types of games you should have fun with this one.

RATING: 6
1st game (six player): Play is fast and smooth, but not particularly deep.  I nearly came back from what felt like a huge point gap early in the game but at potential long term cost - which is interesting to consider at this point.  I love the production values of this game.

2nd game (six players): Play remains fast and smooth, but it's already getting much more complex and actually takes a moment to keep track of what all your options are sometimes with a lot of entirely different paths to victory.  At six players it almost feels like there's much being added constantly.

Solo Campaign (Two marathon sessions vs two automa): The automa runs fairly smoothly but also abstracts so much of the game that it doesn't actually simulate playing another player very well and isn't very interactive.  Overall I cannot recommend this as a solo game - the charters developed really unevenly (one charter actually lagged far worse than the inactive ones) and the board seems really imbalanced for future games in the end due to this.  The good twists and turns are also difficult to appreciate as a solo player.  The game also sprawls buildings so randomly it's extremely hard to grok what your options are and the lack of players trying to make coherent strategies out of their charters exacerbates what is already starting to be a problem in game six.  Finally, the scores (and how competitive the automa was) were very swingy.  As a solo game this is like a 5 over the course of the campaign.

We have done a two-player playthrough and found ourselves loving everything about the game. Admittedly, the rules seem a bit confusing at first because of gaps. But once we started ignoring gaps and reading straight through in order each game, it was much simpler. It feel well balanced, and every game leaves us wanted to play the next one.

Legacy engine building game. Only played the first round at Spiel 2017 in Essen. The game seems to have a lot of body but also seems to miss part of the immersive storyline that can be found in e.g. Pandemic Legacy.

A very "safe" worker placement design. The game practically railroads you into following certain paths in order to progress the game and give you points. Doesn't really have the vibe of a Legacy game though. Rather, this is almost like you and your fellow players are designing a permanent board state similar to Lords of Waterdeep or Caylus once a bunch of buildings are in play. Despite all that, I enjoyed Charterstone fine. It didn't blow me away, but I thought it was fine for what it was. I just don't quite see how some people really enjoy this but not Seafall. Both games aren't identical, but they scratch a lot of the same itches, and I believe Seafall is better.

This was probably my favorite game of 2017.  While it isn't perfect, I think for a Euro legacy game this is exceptionally well done.  I don't really have a lot to say about it that hasn't already been said.  Don't play this one for the story, play it if you enjoy seeing a fun resource management game unfold before you.

So far we have finished 8/12 games, 6players (best player count IMO). And I have to mention that I do like legacy games but the best ones are cooperative (by far).
This game is cute as hell. Nice artwork, excellent components (especially metal coins and how everything fits inside the box). Gameplay is really fast, really nice work placement game, but there something missing in this game. I want more interaction (for instance that you get something if someone places a worker on your building) - a reason to build a building... Not just to score few points. Sometimes you build buildings that are never used in the game... Ever! And one player is way more powerful than the others... Which makes end game really frustrating.
Compared to SeaFall... Well, I like SeaFall better since it had stronger theme (better story) tho the gameplay is way better in Charterstone; as well as moving your progress from game to game.
Again, I bought this game because it is a legacy game tho I didn't have high expectations since it wasn't a co-op game.

Played intro game so rating might change after a few games. 

Turns are quick, it has a nice, clean and functional design plus the legendary aspect is nice and feels dynamic. 

The game itself is mainly a worker placement game which is ok, but you can expand your village and upgrade your character over the games. The legendary aspect is clever because it happens in the middle of a game so you can use everything right away.

4 players, no Automata.

First Game:
My group really liked it (including  me)! I actually cannot stop thinking about the game, even though I got dead last and was the only one to not get 3 glory :(. My one complaint seems to be my main complaint with all Stonemaier games, in that it sort of ends too quickly. I had basically ALL of my influence left at the end of the game, but no time to actually use it... so I played wrong, and now I have learned.

*Spoilers*
I also didn't like the "reveal" about capacity AFTER we used our glory... but I'm sure that was on purpose. Unfortunately, it hurt me (the losing  player :( ) the most. Ah well...

Game 2:
I played poorly... and lost again. However, it was again not all my fault: the market was completely empty and my assistants' engine depends on it... and then before the game ended I gave up many things due to the new capacity restriction. And there was a race for recognition (or whatever it's called) and I couldn't get in... and to top it all off I was trying to build the less "obvious" or more interesting buildings, which ultimately hurt me as I couldn't take advantage of my persona as well. Anywho... I feel like the first two games are really all about following the  "norm" and hinders more long-term and creative strategies.

All of this said, I still very much enjoyed it and am looking forward to our next round!

Games 3-5:
The shape of the game is now coming into being, and each game plays similarly but with enough variation to keep it interesting. Plus, we still have a lot to unlock. Some may complain about the lack of "story" and the minimalism of the legacy, but I like these aspects fine.

Games 6-8:
We are getting close to unlocking everything, which means that games actually play a lot faster and there is a little less excitement (since the rate of opening new things decreased). That said, the game has become more solid and we are finally starting to focus on end game scoring. The last 4 games will likely be played over 2 sessions and be highly focused on VP - an interesting yet foreseen dynamic shift.

Games 9-11:
Oh snap! Twists and turns occur... and the added constraints are making the final few games tight and calculated. We're all now frantically trying for end game points and I can't stop thinking about playing the final game... even though I think I'm going to come up short of Victory. Ah well. I also can't help feeling a little excited to *play through again*, as well as see what happens to actions such as "Build a structure" and "Use the charterstone" once the game is finished and we having no more of these cards to use... how can the game continue to be playable? I want to find out!

Oh and that f&*(#?&$ candle was brutal... but cool!

Final Game:
As is probably the case in most end-games: this was the longest, highest scoring round of all. It took roughly an hour and ended up with 3/4 people beating the previous high score by 10+ points. In addition, the winner blew every one out of the water with a full 117 points! I had 92, and there was a 91 and the last player I believe had high 70s.

Unfortunately (for me), I did not win the full campaign (second place). The player who just scored 91 won by a pretty large margin:
- ~1150
- 1082 (yes, I only precisely remember my own score)
- ~960
- ~930

I liked playing the final game, even though there were no more secrets to unlock. However, I really don't think the end-of-the-game was that interesting. For one thing, everyone is rushing around trying to get 20 point buildings in their charter, and this ended up with everyone's charters just being a ramshackle of unrelated buildings which I felt was pretty lame. In general, my largest complaint for the game as a whole is that creating your charter to be a reasonable engine of any variety doesn't equate - necessarily - into campaign points. It also means that future games will rely on these kind of shitty charters.

Which brings me to my other complaint about the end-game: there are barely ANY buildings/chests to open, so we were expecting some clever new rules on what buildings with these actions on them would do for future plays. It turns out they just do... nothing. You can use them without doing the action to get the points, and that's... it. Very underwhelming and non-clever. Quite disappointing. In general, I do not expect playing the game in post-campaign will hold up very well, but I will give it a few shots in the coming weeks.

I am, on the other hand, looking forward to either redoing a new campaign with the restock, or simply having a hayday going through and trying to create "optimal" charters on the back. Not sure what will be more fun.

All in all, the campaign experience was quite fun and interesting and I would definitely recommend it, with minor reservations.

Desilusión. El juego empieza bien cargado de expectativas, lo que unido a un buen diseño y producción y a una mecánica original de desbloqueo de contenidos sigas interesado en ver qué más hay. Hacia mitad de la campaña empiezas a darte cuenta que verdaderamente no hay una historia detrás (la que te proponen no podía ser más burda), que todas las partidas son prácticamente más de lo mismo, y que en ningún momento has llegado a entender realmente qué es lo que se supone que estás haciendo que sea tan atractivo para mantenerte interesado. Cuando descubres que lo único que ha sucedido es que se ha rellenado un eurogame de peso medio con sobrecomplicación innecesaria y abstracta, para intentar parecer un eurogame complejo, ya casi has perdido toda la ilusión. Y cuando acabas la campaña, y te das cuenta de que el juego que queda no puede ser menos interesante, y que las mecánicas que destacaban de otros juegos quedan ya enterradas porque no hay nada más que desbloquear, es cuando acabas tirándolo a la basura con la sensación de que podrías haber aprovechado el dinero que te ha costado en hacerte con algún otro eurogame de peso medio más interesante y temático que éste. No le suspendo porque nos ha dado partidas entretenidas, pero se va a quedar en aprobado raspado.

I probably rate most things a little highly.  It would probably be good for me to go back and knock a few ratings down a bit.  However, Charterstone really is a 10 for my wife and our friends.  We're having a blast playing it and definitely enjoy the legacy aspect.  Good-natured groans when things go the right way for others, and good-natured gloating when they go your way.  All of us look forward to our next scheduled game when the most recent one is over.  Can't say that about many others.

Interessante esperimento di gestionale legacy in cui però la storia si sente pochissimo e la gestione dell'evoluzione del gioco a livello di regolamento è molto lacunosa e oscura. Alcune ottime idee ci sono e il gioco alla fine risulta interessante e fa venire voglia di rigiocarlo ma la difficoltà nel gestire le regole e non fare errori durante la partita rovina parecchio l'esperienza di gioco.

2 games in: I love the theme, love the many discoveries, the awesome components and the art. There is some ambiguity with certain rules from time to time, and it's definitely not as smooth as Pandemic Legacy in regarding to that. Although, the fact that it's competitive brings the legacy experience to a complete other level. The personalization that comes from the many upgrades, capacity, glory, characters and stuff is very very nice and fun to navigate. The game itself is kinda of paced like other games from Jamey, very fast, which can be very surprising and/or frustrating. Exactly like Scythe!

5 games in... Legacy worker placement.  Cute theme and artwork.  Rules are a challenge early on if a player (or players) are bent on opening as many crates as they can because every crate brings new rules and options.  That said, the game does not change as much as you would expect.  It is still very much the same halfway through.  That may bother some gamers but my family likes the game enough to not mind.  I am personally very interested to try out game post-legacy campaign for playability.

Some games you understand immediately, some you'll never see.  I've played this 3 games, didn't win a single game, but don't know what the others were doing that I didn't do. The only reason I can point to is that I clearly had an other thinking path then the rest and was hardly bumped, which gave me the same negative feeling I had about The Gallerist: if you don't get bumped, you're screwed, as getting bumped means you won 0.5 action for free. 
If that's the reason, then I'll probably will never like this game, as it means you have to take actions from whom you think somebody else also wants to do them. And I don't like that, I won't to create my own path and follow that road, without having to worry if that path will give me enough kicks :s

Auch wenn mir das Comic-Setting nicht so ganz gefällt- das Spiel ist einfach erlernt, dennoch mit taktischer Tiefe.  Man ist stets gespannt, wie sich das Spiel verändern wird- fühlt sich dabei aber nicht wie bei anderen Legacy-Spielen gezwungen, dass Spiel mit der gleichen Truppe weiterzuspielen. Es kann ruhig gewechselt und getauscht werden und das Spiel fühlt sich nicht so erdrückend und anstrengend an. Wirklich tolles Teil!

Rating tentative. Will finalize after campaign. Very encouraging though.

Likely not going to finish. Unfortunately, my wife whom I played the first four games with does not enjoy the game, and I don't want to play against the automa. She is willing to continue for me but I'm not willing to make her play a game she doesn't enjoy.

I think Charterstone is wonderful though and my 8 stands. Legacy games are my cup of tea and this one doesn't disappoint.

I haven't played many legacy games before this, so maybe it is just a general problem I have with the genre, but Charterstone seems intent on handing everyone participation medals. I suppose something needs to happen to make sure players stay invested through the entire campaign, but when the person in last place gets a better reward than the person in 1st it feels like nothing really matters. I feel like at the end the overall winner will wake up, realizing they have been in an insane asylum the whole time, and the other patients have fashioned them a tinfoil crown and named them king of the Looneystone.

Fun legacy game. I have the upgraded tokens and the cool meeples for Meeple Source for the characters. They really enhanced the experience. 

I finished the campaign, winning by just over 20 points. It was very close with my sister and I winning 6 games each. 

Why the story itself was not great, there were a number of exciting moments when boxes were opened and game play changed with new things added. The campaign is really a method for you to create a final, complete game--with your own original town. Yours will not be like anyone elses. 

The more I played the game, the more I liked it. So much was opened up, giving new possibilities. And having the ability to keep playing it after the campaign is finished is great. I see lots of replay value in it.

Three games in and starting to really enjoy it. However, the rules are sometimes very vague. The rulebooks in Scythe and Viticulture (by the same designer) are some of the best I know. Really shocked how Jamey (designer) dropped the ball considering this is a legacy game.

Be sure to check out the FAQs on the publishers homepage if you pick this up. Still a fun game though!

We are halfway through the campaign and have enjoyed it a ton. This is truly the first Legacy game we have played and we are loving it immensely. We have avoided Pandemic Legacy because that game suffers from too much "Alpha" style game play. I couldn't recommend Charterstone enough to people. 

Okay, so now we have completed the campaign and loved every minute of it. We played the campaign over the span of two different days and we all enjoyed the experience.

The more I play it, the less I like it.

A 4/10 game with 11 expansions that are each 4/10 does not suddenly become good because of the variety.  The game suffers from poor balance that could have been predicted despite the legacy elements, a lack of ideas despite a huge set of worker placement games to draw upon, 

I do like how opening new stuff is built into the game and carries an in-game reward.  However, you mostly open new stuff for the VP, not to build a strategy, so there doesn't end up being a sense of emergent history so much as going through the motions.  I hope I open good buildings, because then I will build good buildings, but if I draw back buildings I'll still be building them.

The initial rules being done via stickering is a stupid gimmick that gets in the way of learning a simple game.

While I'm not a fan of "play a worker or retrieve all workers" style games, some of the later stuff that gets added makes that more interesting.

Mostly the game had a lot of potential, but I'm constantly left screaming "Did they even play it?  Did they even lay out the components and think for a moment?  Did they just not care?  Did they just run out of ideas and not bother looking at the host of excellent games that came before?"

When playing the campaign for the first time, things can change quickly and throw less flexible people off their game. With no clear end-game scoring, it can make it difficult what to decide to do in some parts of the game. You unlock things, but won't have time to unlock or build everything.

Cons:

Overall a decent game, but disappointing compared to Jamey's other amazing games.

Played the demo at Spiel '17. 
Pros: Really nice graphic design; high quality material (metal coins!); nice feel of "contructing something"
Cons: Game turns seem a little "flat" (no long term strategy needed - resource collection is priority); game time is rather short; game was recommended to work best with six players (I can hardly find two more players to join me in Pandemic Legacy!); playing the campaign is the heart of the game (is the final game really good enough to not start over?); high price (70+ Euro)
Conclusion: I can't see a reasonable price/value ratio

OK so a update to the score 6 games in :-)

I increased the rating to a 9. The advancement deck has become much more interesting and there are plenty of strategic option already on the board. While at the same time there is still a lot of unexplored content, which I love.

While the story is clearly much weaker than e.g. in Pandemic legacy it still managed to surprise us recently.

4 games in and really impressed with this one. Its getting better each game and I'm hoping we'll want to keep playing our copy once the main legacy games are done

Update Feb 26: We finished the campaign and I like a lot of what the game did. Unfortunately our experience with it though really got frustrating. I think the game is good but after playing through I would heavily suggest to not play 2 players unless you use the automota. It was too easy for people to stick with their own plans and with the right unaware choices we found the abilites got heavliy skewed. A multi player game would certainly balance this out as more buldings would be built, and more interaction would certainly be needed.

{running commentary after each game, *no spoilers*, 2-player, rating subject to change}

GAME 1 - Charterstone leads you gently by the hand, but it also allows you to stumble. We made 2 mistakes, neither egregious but still annoying, that were fixed without harm. We did not use Automas. Mostly good fun, some frustration (and confusion) to start off. Best advice is to carefully peruse (and then re-read) every single word, take your time with things, assume nothing. I enjoyed it. The support for this game is outstanding! I won this session over my opponent by a single VP.

GAME 2 - somewhat bland and repetitive. We had to go back and re-read the rules, yet still a few minor stumbles that we were eventually able to figure out. No Automas. Look at all the questions that appear on this board (we are experiencing some of the same issues), rules confidence is rather low. Still, it feels good yet I do hope Game 3 opens things up a bit...

GAME 3 - well, thankfully things did open up a bit for this session. We scored VP's in a variety of ways, the Guidepost was cool. No Automas. My opponent beat me by just 1 VP, so a very close contest again! Best session so far, IMHO.

Rating drop as interest is waning, too many other games out there that I'd rather play.

Initial thoughts:
Not getting to name your charter because you win the first game is both rude and stupid.
So far it feels like you're punished for opening your crates and building your buildings and speeding along the game. Within the first three games I triggered Minions, buildings(?), and disasters.
Victories 1/3, opened crate C.

Charterstone Review (after 2 chapters)
This is my first legacy game. I’ve been hesitant to purchase something consumable. Two things alleviated my concerns and allowed me to start making permanent changes to the game board and cards. One: there’s a recharge pack and a copy of the board on the backside, so you can do two playthroughs at a discount. Two: The game is, apparently, infinitely re-playable after completion of the campaign. So it’s sort of like building your own unique version of the board game. I’m playing with three people, and hoping that doesn’t permanently make this a 3-player game instead of up to 6 players.

The game unveils new rules at a steady pace, and so far every time I get bored there’s something new to bring me back in. However, some of the rules are difficult to understand, and since all the rules are also spoilers, it’s very difficult to search for and get a clear answer to the questions you’ll naturally have when playing any new game. Cards/rules are revealed in a particular order, and sometimes you’ll miss the cue to reveal the next one, and you’ll feel stuck or confused.

I find myself constantly anxious that I’ve missed something or I’m doing something wrong. In a standard board game, mistakes last one game. Everyone makes them, but by the second or third playthrough you’ve got the hang of it and are finally playing the game the right way. With Charterstone and legacy games in general, those early mistakes affect the entire campaign. There’s no re-do. That makes the game less fun and more frustrating, as you worry you’ve missed something, or frantically search for clarification. As a result, playtime for my group has been 2+ hours per game, rather than 1 hour. The rounds go relatively quickly. It’s just worker placement, so you might go through a few rounds per minute, but then spend 30 minutes peeling stickers, reading them 10 times trying to extract meaning, then searching the internet for further clarification, then looking through the index to see if you’ve missed something and probably spoiling something for yourself.
Speaking of spoilers, the game has misprints. You’ll only know this if you go to developer’s website or catch it in the forums. The corrections, which you ought to read before playing, will spoil late-game rules. If you don’t read them though, you’ll play the game wrong. This kind of catch-22 really should have been avoided. I’m sure they’ll still be selling misprint editions quite some time. Maybe they should mail some sort of patch pack that you can blindly swap in by index number.

We hesitated to place buildings we didn’t see as very useful. We have limited space after all, so why place a building that we’ll never use? Well, [o] SPOILER: a few reasons it turns out. You need to place buildings to progress the game. If you don’t you’ll be stuck in game 1 forever. You also need to place buildings to unlock crates to get better buildings, and the game later introduces the ability to build over old buildings, alleviating the space issue. So even though you may never use your first couple buildings (why would I spend my very finite influence to get one resource and one coin when I can easily acquire both without influence), you have to bite the bullet and put them down. At least you get VP for it. END SPOILER. [/o]

I don’t like the permanence of torn/creased stickers or smudged ink. It’s a minor complaint but the stickers could have been manufactured a bit better (the crease was my fault, but the tear was because it was stuck to the border), and high gloss boxes aren’t the best choice for something you’re meant to write on.

I wanted to like this game. I really did. If my anxiety subsided after game one I’d have much nicer things to say, but given the misprints, some poorly worded rules, and normal first play through mistakes, I think my frustration will continue, and every game we spend with me frantically searching for rule clarification, it gets harder to convince the group to jump in again. It gets harder to convince myself to jump in again. The end of each game has been a huge sigh of relief.

Overall: 3/5. I’ve certainly played worse and I still have some hope for it. It’s a great idea that could have been better executed.

After game 3, I was very excited and I really enjoyed the village building aspect of the game. After game 6, I was really bored and tired by the repeated "open crate", "build a building" actions. It was like I was playing kind of the final game.

I ended up to stop the campaign, unlock all remaining buildings and create my own village/economy. And I have to say that it was straightforward which buildings were better than the others. The only real decision I had to make was whether I want a building to be available in every game or not.

However, after reading the post-campaign rules and having available all the mechanics I think that it is gonna be a really good worker placement game. 

More thoughts after having played some post-campaign games.

This is such a tidy game. Tidy arrangement of the boxes, tidy rules, tidy playtime. More than that, it's downright relaxing to play, which I did not expect from a legacy game. Some low-key drama, some pleasant resource management, and the ability to fine-tune quite the persistent strategy all contribute to Charterstone possibly being the most I've enjoyed a legacy game.

I have never played a more frustrating game in my entire life.

Almost non-existent catch-up mechanic, in a competitive game where you have major incentives for playing on 'your' buildings.

Some charters are obviously more useful at the begging of the campaign(the Red/Black ones that focus on resources and coin). The Red charter in particular has an immediately useful helper, that gives it a slight edge in game 2-3. That edge compounds since it's the usually the first charter that can use Zeppelin/Charter-stone each game, and be almost always 1 persona ahead of everyone else. Almost every other charter has to play catch-up.

By game 5 Red was dominating with 2-3 buildings 'ahead' of everyone else. They were building 20 'value' buildings while everyone else was barely getting to 15.

Even if the individual end game score were close enough, it dose not really matter since you only gain 'campaign' VP of you score over thresholds of 10s and most of the end game VPs come from building anyways. It makes logical scene to be in the same 'area' as everyone else(VP wise) while pushing to have the most 'valuable' buildings built.

While there are some options to consider, the decision tree is shallow enough that there's not really an opportunity to outplay your opponents, just have to hope that they can make a mistake/miscalculation so that you can catch up.

Anyway the game had potential, it does a bunch of nifty things, but ultimately it fells like a run-of-the-mill WP with the extra kicker that if you performed poorly in one game, you will probably do the same in the next.

Really pains me to rate this a 1 since clearly lots of effort went into the design, but the entire experience felt really flat, winner was pretty much obvious since game 4.
Almost wish the scoring was a bit more obfuscated(a la Pandemic Legacy), or there was a bit more randomness in the game, possibly even a straight-up power downscaling for the winner(maybe loose 1 influence for each game won)

TLDR: Legacy WP can feel really unsatisfying if playing with competitive players.

Charterstone is an economic worker placement legacy game. My PL group was interested in starting another legacy game and this appealed to me a lot more than Gloomhaven.

I won't go into too much of how the game plays, first because I've only played one game out of the twelve and second because I don't want to spoil too much.

But essentially you have two workers, there's some preprinted action spots on the board, and room for a lot more. On your turn you place a worker or pull back your workers. It's very obvious that the game is going to expand as you go along. I enjoyed the first play and am looking forward to what changes over time.

Campaign has been extremely fun, but replayability is semi-low due to campaign being the meat of the game. I'll be satisified with the experience after 12 plays though.

A legacy game designed by Jamey Stegmaier (of Scythe fame). A 12-scenario campaign played on an expanding board, with some elements carrying over to successive games, while rules and new mechanics are added over the course of the campaign. You can optimize the order of your turn, but it is impossible to "block" another player from an action like in many other villager placement games. Once the 12 games are over, players have a unique, permanent setup that can be used as a game board going forward.

1 Game in....jury is still out.
2nd game complexity is increasing.... game is interesting, but so far the lack of story is not engaging.  I think this will be a Long 12 games.

I wouldn't play this again, but then by definition, it can't be played twice.   Now I will live forever with the feeling, "Wow, I wish I had understood that sooner, I would have done that differently."  Except instead of being able to play differently in the future, like in any good game, I will instead throw way too much money in the trash.

I was really hoping to like this more but my lackluster experience was mainly due to my awareness that legacy games aren't my thing.  I don't like opening up new things while the games is in progress and I don't enjoy the admin that goes along with playing.  I did finish the campaign and am looking forward to playing out the game as is though.  I think the mechanics and gameplay were pretty great though.

Game is perfect, as a legacy game. Unfortunately, playing it after finishing the legacy is impossible, because during the game, in order to win, you have to build higher tier buildings which are worth more points, which are usually not good production buildings and are not THAT usefull, often destroying excellent lower tier buildings which are worth fewer points. Maybe the problem with the game is that higher tier buildinga are, IMHO; not better, just worth more points. 
But, despite that "problem" I still think this game is really good and think it is perfect 5/7!! Gave it a perfect rating and am thinking about buying recharge pack.!

The price could be a little lower, but I understand there are a lots of sticeker cards which are not that cheap.... dunno ... Overall, had a excellent time playing it and really enyojed playing one after another... until it was over :(

Rating is highly subject to change as campaign progresses (rating after game 4).

So far, my favourite Stegmaier game. The gameplay itself at the core is not greatly interesting; lacking in tension or meanful and exciting decision points. However, the overall experience is a good one as I enjoy the campaign of investing in my character and charter. It feels more like one is enjoying legacy as an experience (e.g. opening boxes, sticking things) rather than the game itself. Things may change but I'm currently wondering if this could have been done very easily as a completely non-legacy game with similar effect. Rather than taking stickers off cards, they could have just used cards.

Could use some clearer rules (the rules on the cards sometimes require several reads before understanding sets in). Otherwise, excellent game! We are about three games in at this point and we all very much look forward to the next play session.

At the basic game level, this is a rather standard worker placement/resource management game. The components, admittedly, are excellent. What makes this special is the legacy element that draws players into wanting to continue game after game to find out what happens next. I will have to revisit my rating after completing the campaign to see whether my opinion is any different. Edit: After 12 games, I feel about the same. I'm a little disappointed that the action spots for constructing buildings and opening crates don't get any new functions after the campaign ends.

RATING: 7.5
played half the campaign during a New Year's party. Thought the game was really good, though I would recommend to new people that they be VERY meticulous in reading what cards get pulled/opened/affixed due to crates being affected by the Charterstone/Zeppelin. A SLIGHT mistake can change subsequent plays in a pretty large fashion.

Brilliant design, very intricate.  But, I feel it lacks in a few areas; rules are not that clear, connection to theme is a little bit lacking, repetitive gameplay (game group quit after hadfull of games). Also while it can be played by a varied number of players I feel the more players the better the experience.

This was a very different game. I've only played through a couple games (3 or 12) but so far I'm really enjoying it. It is different from many other games that I've seen before. So far I'm interested enough that I think I would get the recharge pack to play it again. We will see how I feel after all 12 games though!

It was fine, but nothing special. I enjoyed playing, but there's not really any compelling reason to play the completed game over any worker placement game that I already enjoy (For example, I would much rather play a game of Viticulture than a post-campaign game of Charterstone). To me, the locking and changing as it went was the interesting part, and not the prospect of playing a fairly basic worker placement on a board that is less than ideal due to the randomness of buildings and inactive charters. I really enjoyed the legacy aspects of the game, with the exception being the story which was not that compelling and did not have that much impact on the game at all. I won the campaign without winning a single game out of twelve. While willing the campaign was nice, it also wasn't that rewarding in comparison to falling just a few points of winning games multiple times. 

For me to do another campaign, I would want to play it with the full six players and play as one of the two charters that were inactive in our campaign, otherwise I'm not sure there's enough there to make it compelling despite being a good experience overall.

I have been playing this with several friends since it arrived at the local shop, we are all having a great time, even though we are fairly sure of who will win. We have ideas for future playthroughs (already have the refresh kit) and can't wait to see how different boards turn out. Great times have been had, and F the Automa (thing is mean! (in a good way)).

Game 7/12. The game startet out fine for me but I'm slowly loosing interest in it, because it's evolving into a type of game I don't enjoy. I would be fine ending it now and we have 5 games left. 

I won't go into to much detail about what I don't like about game, because I don't want to spoil it for others, but some of the things I don't enjoy is the same things that I didn't enjoy in Seasons and Millennium Blades.

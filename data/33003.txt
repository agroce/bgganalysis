Bought in the recent GMT sale and delighted to have done so.I think its the best game GMT have put out in years. Beautiful map with big hexes and everything you need on it in terms of rules and exceptions. Great counters and there were only 1 or 2 small things I needed to think about. The rules should be familiar to anyone with some experience of the basis UGO-IGO model. The gameplay is nice too. The variability of reinforcements adds to the replayability and while the play can get a bit channeled after a few plays possibly I think there is enough in it to come back to again and again. Also an undergamed period of the war. Playable in 5 or 6 hours to conclusion with two experience players.

RATING: 8
Nothing wrong with the game mechanics, nor the exceptional physical presentation, nor indeed the GMT sale price. It may not have massive repeat play value, but otherwise it seems to tick all the boxes required of a superior new release -- and its eastfront hex-&-counter, a format I had not so much abandoned long ago as never bothered with. As with all such designs the magnitude of its colour, depth and historical accuracy increases ease of play.

A carnage to the Russian side, but unforgivable for the German. It takes expert mountain troops to climb the Caucasus mountains!! Hard decisions to the Germans... The Russian just need to cling to the ground and cities (with the precious help of the NKVD).

An excellent game: rules are very clearly presented and laid out, and the game components are very nice, with large counters and map hexes. Game plays very smoothly, but with tough tactical and operational decisions on both sides.

Someone commented on BGG recently that we are in the 'Golden Age of Wargaming' - this game is one of the fruits of this 'Golden Age'.

 Juego no muy complicado y entretenido. Muy bien diseñado. Casi todo está en le mapa, de forma que es muy fácil guiarse y encontrar las cosas. Tiene un sistema de combate donde la calidad y los blindados son fundamentales puen dan unas ventajas que pueden ser decisivas. Tiene un sistema de movimientos muy bien pensado, de forma que se convierte en un juego muy ágil. Cada bando tiene su estrategia, pero también tiene unos elementos aleatorios que hacen modificar los planteamientos de vez en cuando para darle una rejugabilidad muy interesante. Además... se juega en una tarde.

Quality East Front operational game about a lesser-known campaign in the shadow of Stalingrad.

RATING: 8
On the face of it, an old school hex and counter wargame complete with a CRT and lots of fiddly detail.  The one thing that's new to me is the asymmetric player turns, with a Soviet impulse in the middle of the Axis turn.  The fiddly detail is rendered manageable by lots of reminders on the counters and in well designed player aids.

The game itself has the Axis player racing against time and weaker Soviet forces across a wide open plain north of the Caucasus mountains.  Making the most of quite limited mechanised forces is essential.  For the Soviet it is a constant struggle to form and re-form your defensive lines.  In spite of the chrome and exceptions, the game purrs along very smoothly and presents both players with interesting challenges.

Production quality is to the usual GMT standard.  I found the map artwork both easy on the eye and functional.

Dos partidas jugadas y no registradas.

Wargame de dificultad media-baja moderadamente ágil y entretenido.

De corte clásico pero con bastante originalidad por ser una campaña muy olvidada de la WWII.

Paso a reseñar los aspectos no tan buenos:

- No es un juego para jugar todos los días. Existen algunos detalles para tratar de hacerlo más rejugable (eventos, refuerzos aleatorios), pero no creo que sean suficientes porque la estrategia principal es básicamente siempre igual para ambos bandos.

- El jugador Ruso lo tiene francamente muy difícil. Ante un jugador del Eje eficiente no tiene nada que hacer y sólo puede confiar en que el dado le acompañe (y tal vez ni así consiga aguantar).

- Jugar como Ruso es muy aburrido. Estamos hablando de que atacarás muy muy pocas veces en toda la partida. Sólo defenderás lo más eficientemente posible. La mayoría de los turnos no atacarás para conservar las tropas (y aún así las perderás casi todas porque son penosas si las compraras con las del Eje).

- Es uno de los juegos más antiguos del autor y por tanto menos pulidos. Si los comparas con otros posteriores de la misma familia (Ardennes '44 o Normandy '44 por ejemplo) se nota que sus mecánicas han sido ampliadas y mejoradas.

RATING: 5
Way overrated.  
Limited replayability;  The decisions are too obvious, only one realistic attack route.  No real opportunities for the Soviets to threaten supply.  Too many fiddly rules which add nothing but require constant look-up.

It's not what you put in that makes a good game, but what you leave out.  It could do without the useless Brandenburger unit, or the random reinforcements which are so similar they may as well be the same.  Or the fiddly reinforcement placement rules.. "add a unit here and there but not there".  The Azov fleet adds absolutely nothing.

A simple game with simple strategy and tactics should have clean and simple rules.  Disappointing.

RATING: 6
Initial Impression: GMT did a wonderful job with the components. Simonitch managed to create a spectacular map. Not only was it visually appealing, with large clear hexes, he baked a large amount of rules chrome right onto the map, making for easy rules references and reminders. Being my first Simonitch experience, the rules weren't particularly difficult. Most of the concepts were simple to remember. Unfortunately for me, the game felt almost too generic, something I would suggest a new wargamer try out. With so little in the way of flavor rules, I felt that the game didn't stand out in any way and was entirely forgettable. I sold my copy to someone who will appreciate the game more than me. However, the blandness of the game hasn't detracted me from trying out other Simonitch games. I may even revisit this game sometime in the future, provided I do so against a live opponent.

My initial impressions are very good.I like the mechanics overall as well as the attritional feel and the subject matter.  I have never played a game of this operation so was curious to see how it would play out.  Having played it twice solo now I am a little concerned about the CRT.  It is so attritional to the point where a German Panzer division can take a step loss to a poor soviet infantry unit.  What I had to do in order to counteract this is to stack my panzer units with my infantry units to help absorb step losses.  This I think is contrary to standard armoured tactics.  But I try to look past that one issue I have with the game and look at the overall feel.  Once you get down to the wire you get a feeling that you just don't have enough forces to do the job.  So in the big picture I think it models it well. I try not to think of it as my 10 factor elite panzer division is being given a step loss by a poorly trained 2 factor Soviet unit, but rather think of it as a gradual degradation of combat ability with constant fighting without a break.  

I would recomend this game for anyone looking for a light to light medium game.  I wasn't sure at first but now am sold, this game is a keeper.  

I would love to try this via Vassal or Cyberboard if I can find a willing opponent.  I have never used either.

Fine game on an interesting topic, which recreates the historic campaign really nice. The 1942 embattled frontiers seem to appear again, so far a really good simulation.

Very nice components, short and very clean and easy to learn rules. Also offers good chrome and a (seems to me) real feel for the challenges of the historic campaign. A lot of fun and - for the games I played solo so far (with the exception of a 5-turn learning play) - a very near run thing where the winner was not to be foreseen until the very last turns. 

Some (little) points to critizise so far: because of the Sequence of Play it is very hard for the Soviet player to get offensive and to pocket some German forces. CRT results favor the attacker a bit. And: There are very few paths of advance for the German units, following roughly the historic ones. So I'm not quite sure about replay value.

Nevertheless: Recommended!

At first play seemed like an average wargame. But on further plays I'm seeing some silver lining. Above standard counters and map, the situation is a nice brain burner, concise rules that work well and are tight. The layout is top notch too lots of very helpful info printed in the right places, VERY professional.

I'm a long time wargamer but Mr. Simonitch has moved into my top 5 current game designers with Normandy 44 and this.

RATING: 10
Top tip for playing the Germans: you can't be casualty-averse. You're short on time, so take risks, take the losses, and press on. It's pretty easy to get retreats even at low-ish odds on the CRT, so use your mobility to cut off and destroy Soviets. I think these are the key things for the Germans to grasp to be competitive, and with super-aggressive German play the game is pretty well balanced.

I've come to like this game a ton, as it has all the good stuff from Simonitch's hex-n-counter games at a more manageable complexity, length, and playability level.
---
As an update on my feeling for the balance, I don't think it's way off. The pressure does seem to be on the Germans; the Soviets have an easier opening game of forming and reforming lines and I think for most will have an overall shorter learning curve, being more on the defensive. They also can endure early-game screw-ups better.

As for the comments about replayability, yes, the opening moves for the Germans has to be to drive to Krasnodar; but there are interesting tactics to it. Not enough to make the tournament game a long-term winner I think, but enough to make learning the game interesting. The game-long balancing act is how much to commit to the Black Sea coast drive and how much to commit to Grozny, and when to pivot and when (for the Soviets) to counter-attack. The variability of Soviet reinforcements will mix things up. It's always going to be a pretty tactical game, but there are lots of interesting operational details to balance and manage.
---
I am becoming slightly suspicious of at least some pro-Soviet bias, but I am not quite sure. The pressure is definitely on the Germans though, and their tactics are not straightforward. As is often the case, going toe-to-toe with the Soviets for cities is not the answer; it's got to be surrounding and flanking first, followed by inflicting fatal retreats. Also, there is a fair chunk of luck in the game; a lot of bad weather early can be a back-breaker for the Germans, but so can lousy reinforcements for the Soviets. I think it all works out, and produces a very interesting game which I have thoroughly enjoyed playing as both sides, but it'll be interesting to see if how opinions of balance develop.
---
After playing a run of truly horrendous games from GMT, games that made me want to drive down to Hanford and yell at people, The Caucasus Campaign was merciful relief. A tight, interesting game that presents both players with tough choices and a wide-open battlefield, with each side having a very different feel, with well-managed chaos and a modest, reasonably intuitive rules set.

The advertised playing time for the full campaign seems a little optimistic, I'd budget more like 6-8 hours unless you play fast (it's probably a 2-session game for me), but the tournament scenario should run 4 or less and seems pretty good. The Germans have a tough row to hoe, I think, but the Soviets have to be good at absorbing punches and knowing when to fight and when to bail. Like other Simonitch games, full-on assaults are suicidal, so the Germans do lots of infiltration, and the tactics and operational details feel right.

So anyway, after the run of recent GMT disasters, this one seems like it's in the sweet spot and I imagine my rating will go up once I get more comfortable with the game. But what else would you expect from Simonitch?

Simonitch's core WW2 system makes it into the Caucasus. Unfortunately, here it proves to be rather generic, and there's nothing of the genius of his traffic rules in Ardennes 44 to rescue what is, fundamentally, a dull situation. Gameplay rapidly becomes very predictable, and there's not an awful lot for the Soviet player to do other than shuffle his defenders about the map.

RATING: 4
Update: sold, just not worth the frustration of trying to guess whether the Germans should get 2, or 3, attacks per turn when trying to maneuver and attack in the omnipresent bad terrain. 

Learning and solitairing France '40, whose rules are a model of clarity and simplicity by comparison. NOT the same system, by any means, despite some similarities.

--

I keep reading/watching reviews that say things like "The rules are not at all complicated." or "This game does not have a lot of special rules."

Word for word I think this is the most complex wargame I have ever tried to learn - and I have learned a lot of big games like A3R, WiF, OCS, etc.  The reason for the complexity is because the rules are an absolute mess - arbitrary, overwrought, no rhyme or reason to all the fiddly rules on movement/retreat/losses/advance, on and on.

The rules aren't that long, but they don't map to any kind of reality and are filled with exceptions, arbitrary rules, and chrome.  Every sentence must be memorized because there appears to be no underlying logic to any of it.  Why are reinforcements received in one phase and replacements in another?  Why are infantry movement rates greater in the Primary phase but mechanized Mobile Assaults only allowed in the Secondary?  Why are Extended Movement and Rail Movement only allowed in the Primary Phase, Mobile Assaults only allowed in the Secondary Phase, but Strategic Road Movement allowed in both?  Why can an infantry do Extended Movement (+2 MP) if you start in an EZOC, but it can't do Strategic Road Movement (+1 MP) if it starts in an EZOC?  Why is the supply effect on movement given in hexes rather than effect on movement points?  Why does combat in the Secondary Phase require spending movement points in the preceding Movement Phase, but combat in the Primary Phase does not?  Why do some combat modifiers give shifts, others give a DRM, others halve the attacker or defender strength, while still others give a number of bonus strength points to the defender?  

The combination of qualitative ("hex"  "Stop") and quantitative ("0.5 mp" "Assault marker costs 3 MP") effects that often both apply to a given situation make for a rules set that cannot be understood, only guessed at. Units can attack into terrain they are not allowed to enter, which raises all sorts of questions.  Mobile Assaults "ignore MP costs" and just cost 3 MPs, which sounds simple till you realize that "Stop" is an "MP cost" so it is totally unclear what happens if a unit Mobile Assaults against a "2 MP and Stop" type hex.

 This is a nightmare rules set that will require constant looking-things-up and notes.

What is this sequence of play modelling?  I find it incomprehensible.

I have to wonder how many people are actually playing this game correctly.  I can't understand why so many people rate this game so highly.  It makes me wonder what else they are playing, that they consider this game well-designed.  

Might be a good game, though it seems very hard on the Germans, especially if they get a few bad die rolls early on.  Regardless of odds they have a 1 in 3 chance of losing a step on an attack, and 2/3 of the time the defender gets to choose which unit takes the hit (armor, duh).  It is not a great game, because it is way too hard to learn, or come back to if you learned it before.  In a way it reminds me of a Bowen Simmons game - a lot of people probably think they are playing it correctly, but are not.  The people who say it is easy to pick up and learn and play in a few hours are almost certainly playing it incorrectly.

I am trying to solitaire it but it feels more like work than a game, due to the mess that is the rules.

It has amazingly good and functional map and counter graphics.  I suspect that is enough to get a high vote from a lot of people who don't actually try to play it according to the rules as written.

Nice puzzle-like feel for the Germans in this one, and the Soviets do have some decisions to make. However, I feel the Soviet player could be a bit bored in this one, as they are largely on the defensive. For that reason, it does lend itself to solo play of both sides, as the Russians are mainly on the defensive. Either that, or play one side and then swap.

I love the Simonitch games I've played so far, and this one is no exception. I also like the fact that this one covers a lesser known campaign. Some nice elements of chrome as always to give this game its own particular feel.

The roll for different types of replacements, the chit draw for Soviet reinforcements, the variables for if and where some German reinforcements arrive, weather variation later on, the swings of some columns on the CRT, and determined defences all make for quite a bit of replayability. Not so sure how many options the Axis have as to where they advance, and so that may limit replayability to some degree.

The game system is pretty straightforward, and so the moves along fairly quickly. Definitely one that I will play again.

Rating after 2 plays. This is a decent, updated hex/zoc/odds WW2 game. The primary/secondary movement phases are an interesting touch, and the replacement rules are more varied than you would expect. There's some chrome, but nothing that should put you off.

There was some confusion for us. Specifically, the rules regarding mobile assaults vs regular assaults were not entirely clear to myself or my opponent, and I have a feeling it's going to come up on the boards regularly. Figuring out the difference between "seasonal marsh" and "regular marsh" wasn't immediately obvious to us either.

But, ignoring the rules & map issues, it's become apparent that the tournament scenario is best played solitaire. It just isn't interesting to be the Russians for those first seven turns. It's also apparent that the Germans have a single best strategy (dive on Krasnodar), which means there's really no replay value, unless you enjoy seeing how many A1/D1 the German player suffers before he gets there.

[Edit: At least they've changed the rules so that the attacker, not the defender, gets to select the damaged units on A1/D1 result. In the original rules there was really no point in continuing if the German player got a few unlucky die rolls on Turn 1.]

Traded.

The fine map portrays the areas from the Sea of Azov to Batumi and from Astrakhan to Derbent by the Caspian Sea and the Caucasus mountain ridge with its snowy peaks. The big map hexes and the large counters allow for a nice playable surface. It has mountain troops, naval units and a few Soviet ships, airplanes, armor indeed, NKVD troops, armored trains, Red Guards, Romanians and even hypothetical Italian troops. The 24 page rules booklet with its examples of play is clear and the game mechanics allow you to simulate this part of military history in an intriguing and fascinating way. It includes a tournament scenario and the full campaign. A fine addition to your collection.

A solid design. Playable in an afternoon, perhaps an eve too. Not too complex and has an excelent interface on the map making this game easier playing than some of its piers.
The onus is on the Germans to make ground fast. This will inflict a lot of casualties on the Russians but if they can slow the Germans down just a little and make it a slogging match they will win. The  German player does have a few choices on what angle to make his or her advance and which cities to strike for. The Russian must decide where the best lines of defence can be drawn. Both sides have a logistical problem to contend with.

A design blending playability and historicity, with some special units abilities and peculiar traits. A good game, albeit there are better options for wargame beginners due to those few special units and rules.  

Decent maps and counters, nice size so no tweezers needed. 

Short, excellent rulebook, one of Mr. Simonitch trademarks.

It seems there are no plenty of strategies so maybe replayability is not high. Anyway, quite a good game to play sporadically.

The German side is harder to play; it demands an aggressive style, making hard, fast and accurate attacks; the Soviet is mainly defensive and has to manage an enduring resistance using his reinforcements and strong troops to hold the German advance.

So far I really enjoy the game. It has some unique mechanics that add some uniqueness without being too outside the box. In addition the amount of chrome seems good. I think it could use a bit more but to each his own. 

There have been a couple of "ah ha" rules moments that, once you grasp them, makes a big difference in how you play a particular side. 

I especially liked how it followed the historical narrative without binding our hands too much. I'm not an expert in the Caucasus campaign, but from what I know it essentially mirrored what actually happened.

RATING: 7
clean rules, good art, solid play, interesting historical situation.

the living rules are a must to avoid a few bad combat rolls from killing the German advance early.

game-wise, the Russians are mostly constrained to backing up.  the tournament game is very tactical as there isn't enough time to do anything other than take the nearest VP cities.  the campaign game has some strategic options, but turns into an attrition grind on the Black Sea coast and in the vicinity of Grozny.  Since it is almost always possible to get at least a 50% chance to retreat the defender with air support, the late game hinges on which side avoids rolling 1 or 2 on determined defense.  certainly nail-biting, but the options for each player are pretty limited.

despite the above, I enjoyed my time playing it.

I would say it is fairly balanced, although I suspect the weather rolls and Italian entry could end up being decisive factors in who wins and who loses.  Bad weather cuts the German allowed attacks in half, and Italian entry gives you 3 not-so-useful units at the expense of requiring the Germans to get 2 more VP, which won't be easy.

probably best played solitaire, or as an introductory game with a new wargamer handling the Russians.

solitaire:  turn 7=7VP, turn 14=21VP (German victory)

counters clipped.

A decent intro Hex and Counter game. It is relatively simple, I'm not sure if it is quite as easy as SCS or the A Victory series, but it still is on the low end of complexity. A very traditional hex and counter game, that we come to expect from Simonitch. I don't know if there is a lot to rave about here mechanically, the CRT is relatively attritional, that's good in my book.

I feel like a lot of the other comments on this game are fair. The Russians really don't have a lot to do. It's possible the Russian side will develop layers with more play, but at the start it seems like a pretty basic break, reform, occasionally counterattack sort of thing.

German play, on the other hand, has a lot of interesting decision points. How you decide to push, where you decide to focus on, and how you split your forces, are all very interesting decisions that have a lot of butterfly effect later on. Once you have committed yourself to your plan too, it's difficult to make any changes once you see a weakness. The Krasnodar turn especially is very tricky, since there is a lot of room for error if you don't put enough speedy units down the Grozny road.

Lastly, trust the game manual when it says you need to keep your chin up as the Russians. Even if things look terrible, a good couple of reinforcements or one turns delay can completely swing the game your way.

Overall, interesting, but only as a solitaire experience, I think. I might consider playing it against someone where they take the Germans so I can see if the Russian side just seems anemic in comparison, but I don't know if I'll bother.

Feels like a classic wargame updated to capture the situation in an easy to play package. Tweeks to classic mechanics such as the primary and secondary movement phases elegantly show the assymetrical nature of the two armies. Lots of replay as the Germans have many choices to make and the Soviets get a variable mix of reinforcements

Another excellent consim from a talented and meticulous designer who has more than a few to his name. A knife fight with lots of decision pressure on the players, but not necessarily scripted either. I feel compelled to note the very high quality of the map and counter design... so intuitive, functional and easy on the eyes when they come together in play. In my opinion, one glance at a photo of TCC in action illustrates what a board wargame should look like. (The artwork that drenched The Devil's Cauldron, by way of comparison, struck me as an orgy of graphic design self-indulgence that reached critical mass when the counters hit the map -- or, rather, when they disappeared on it.)

RATING: 7.5
A very good wargame using a classic but proven game engine to simulate the caucasian campaign opposing the german army (and its allies) to the soviet Red army. My only doubt about this solid design (really like every game designed by Mark Simonitch) is its replayability. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Initial play impression from two plays of the tourney scenario...the campaign might add some interest as it would allow for very different openings and might let the Soviet player have some fun by the end.

Typical Simonitch gaming goodness...tight rules, lots of chrome for the history buff, well-organized and presented.  However, there is a weird contrast between limited secondary movement opportunities and ricochet robot advance-after-combat rules.  I'm not aware of many games where a unit with limited movement can attack in one direction and then "advance" in any other.  Retreats through enemy zocs via friendly-occupied hexes creates odd chains around key VP hexes.  These narrative oddities are encountered throughout the game...perhaps it was deemed necessary for achieving historic timetables using this familiar-but-modified Simonitch design. 
 
It seems like an ideal game for solitaire players who can't get enough of the east front, or pbem players where the Soviet player won't mind the Axis player taking an hour to make a move when the Soviet player only needs five minutes for his..  The Axis needs to take advantage of mobile assaults to have a chance, and turns the entire offensive for the tournament game into a lengthy min/max planning game..  The final verdict is a game I want to like but one that would be among the last games I'd ever suggest for ftf play.  My rating of "6" is for pbem play.

System is nice,  but the game is.. not really fun as the Russians. You get pounded and are only trying to slow down the Germans enough so they miss their VP target.  It is probably a good sim,  but not a super fun one for one side.

Good low to moderate complexity operational wargame. A lot of chrome-y rules and regional flavour, but not bogged down by them.

The long-awaited Mark Simonitch wargame design.  He is my top 5 wargame designer.  His games are all highly replayable, elegantly designed, player-friendly mechanics, nice map graphics.

Beautiful map with larger hexes portraying the area south of Don river and north of the Caucasus mountain where Germans and Soviets fought feriously across the plain.  One tournament scenario (6 turns) lasts for 3 hours and a campaign which can be completed in 6 hours with 14 turns.  Perfectly fit for my game time. 

Caucasus is like the Dunkirk on the east - summer, hot and a lot of paer circling and envelopment actions minus the complete Allied evacuation from the shore. I like the richochet effect of the German panzers - that they can fan out from where they attack, while not necessarily moving into the vacated hex as the first of advance after combat.  The system is a further slight twist to the base game system like Normandy '44 and all the better!  Everyone should like Mark Simnitch's WW2 wargaming system.  

The ZOC bond is not called per se in the rules but units retreating into it (either bond hex or hexline) suffer further step loss.  The ZOC bond hexside ("link") is therefore toned down a bit in its effect as it doesn't affect movement like that in Normand' 44.  The mobile assualt and the secondary impulse rules are special features of this game and play good effect on the simulation of the tank operations.  In fact, the best in my opinion!

Mark se está convirtiendo en uno de mis diseñadores favoritos. Este Caucasus me gusta.
Los componentes muy buenos, calidad GMT, y llaman la atención el tamaño de los counters,un poco más grande del tamaño habitual.

Very tight, asymmetrical battle with only moderate complexity.  I played the Russians and paid for my usual rule-book skimming.  Great thing was, no matter how many fights I lost (many, including a stupid armor attack), the game came down to one die roll in a last gigantic siege.  

I do wonder about its replayability, and how fun it is for the Russians to always be on defense.  But for now, I'm a fan!

I really wanted to like this game. It had all of the elements that I love. Eastern front, mid war, Simonitch design. I just didn't like it and maybe that was because it is a complicated game in a simple game's clothing. There are so many exceptions to remember that it becomes a chore. Maybe the fact that I could never figure out how to win as the Axis also had something to do with it. Top notch production values though.

Neat little package. The rulebook is really tight and clear, the map is beautiful, It is very accessible with just enough chrome to make the theatre of the campaign come to life without bloating the rules. The rules for the Sea of Azov flotilla, armoured trains for instance are only a couple of paragraphs long and add a lot of flavour even if in the end, their impact is very limited.

This games does a lot of things right, it is pleasant, fun to play and covers an exotic not often covered theatre but there are a few weak points :

I feel the Russian player's role is very passive, it is mostly all about withdrawing, repositioning and deciding where to dispatch your reinforcements, which is not uninteresting though, but the way I played, very few counter attacks.

As a result replayability is probably not super high, because of the big hexes, seas, turn tracks and various boxes on the map, there isn't that much room for pushing panzers or many different axis for attacking. Similarly the sudden death victory conditions add a lot of tension and urgency but also severely limit your options as the attacker.

Initial rating of 5.5.  

Everything about this game appears solid, but for some reason it's failing to create a decent level of interest to engage my interest in playing to completion.

As another rating says, there do need to be more options available to the Germans in deciding where to advance and attack in order to get a winning tally of VPs.

Will play again to solidify my opinion, however.

Lowered to a 5.  Can't avoid the feeling of false choice for the Germans as the layout of the VP hexes and forces at hand essentailly forces you into the same / very similar choices as to how to attack.

An original topic, yet a game that leaves mixed feelings.

The rules seem simple but include too many fidly exceptions and special cases to make it seamless. Even after some games, people spend their time checking this or that. Some examples: difference between replacements and reinforcements; specific rules for some Soviet marines, brandenburgers, ost troops, Azov flotilla's ZOC etc.; special retreat situations; etc.

The game is also terribly one sided. As long as one realizes CRT's worst result is A1, one keeps attacking all the time. Germans have a great go at that and just smash anything they face. Although the play balance is not that bad (as Germans tend to barely get to the victory level by game end), it is really no pleasure to play the Soviets.

Three satisfying plays in: a multi-phased German turn (along with armor) keep the initiative with the Germans, and though the Russian's are teetering there's satisfaction after recovering from those first encirclements, staging a delaying defense, and those selective counter-attacks can be devastating. 

Lovely learning process. The first play the Russians seemed unbeatable (I wasn't managing the German's mobile attacks well), the second the Germans (a rule mis-read had their mobile attacks too mobile) , and this third - with every rule right finally - the Russians fell back & drew the Germans forward & then stuffed them with a double-depth defensive line behind the Laba River that made Maikop impenetrable, and counter-thrusts broke the armored advance toward Grozny at Armavir. 

I'd thought I'd nailed a German opening but the execution, well, let's say it lost focus. Packed it away after a week on the table, but this will be easy to pull back down for another series, the rules flow & setup is quick & I'll get itchy to sort out the perfect offense.

Great game. Love the scale, relatively simple (to Ardennes '44, say) but with Simonitch chops that give it his brilliant wrinkles to sort out. And I think really getting this down will help me finally take on his Ardennes & Normandy designs.

Preliminary rating based on the fact that I love all the Eastern Front game and this one is a MUST.
Even if it covers only FALL BLAU, I cannot wait to play it.
GREAT RULES MANUAL, SUPERB HISTORICAL RESEARCH, ESSENTIAL COUNTER GRAPHIC.

EDIT after 4 games: rules have been adapted to the map. Units movement follows 4 differents sets of rules, depending on mech/not mech, moving/eploiting. This creates too many exceptions for only one scenario available. Better to change some terrain hex over the map and make only 1 rule set for movement.

Remains a good game, but without great appeal/replay value.

I bought the game after reading Joel Toppen's strategy article in C3i (I love everything Joel is involved with), and I've only heard good things about Mark Simonitch's designs.

That being said, after two plays I'm unsure about the game. The rulebook is good, the production values are great, the conflict is interesting and I would like to play it a few more times, but it seems Germans have a really hard time winning and the game seems to unfold more or less the same: drive south, then split south and east. These are bold statements after only two plays, so as I said I want to verify them by playing more.

Another beautiful game by GMT and Mark Simonitch. This is a simple game to learn, especially for seasoned wargamers. The rules are well written with little ambiguity. The components are first-rate with big map hexes and counters. 

However, after numerous plays I don't believe that the Germans can win this game very often, especially against any reasonably competent Soviet player; and I doubt the German player can ever win a sudden death victory. With the victory conditions as written it seems that the Germans will be lucky to survive past game turn 7 or 8. 

I would rate the game much higher if it weren't for the unbalanced victory conditions.

RATING: 3.1
The blurb says that two hikers invented the game in the middle of the woods and played it while travelling.
I have visions of those guys stumbing across some blood soaked mahogany box, half buried in the mud and grass of the New England countryside. Opening the carved bone latch and reaching inside the human skin lined interior, they discovered a set of dice made from dried and shaped kitten's brains.

Bound by some ancient magic they brought it back to civilisation to share with others the maddening experience of rolling dice for an indeterminably random amount of time for no entertaining reason at all, save for the distant voices of terrified kitten screams that echo half-real in the back of the mind of anyone who plays.

An old favorite, which I've passed on to my kids. I used to play this with a buddy on lunch at the factory in the summer. One of a handful of games that got me into the hobby. I just bought each of my kids a deluxe set, and myself three extra sets of cubes.

Smoking weed is bad, kids!  But Cosmic Wimpout isn't.  I've been fan of stoner rock all my life, yet somehow didn't know about this game until I read Looney's piece in the 100 Best Hobby Games book.  About the best $3.50 you can spend on gaming.  Quick to teach and fun to play.

It's got an insanely addictive one-more-roll factor going for it. We tend to use it as a palate cleanser between heavier games, or to wind down after something thinkier. I'm always smiling during this, even if I am turns behind everyone else because I can't make the initial 35 to get in.

A push your luck dice game that the non-gamer type will enjoy if they can get past all of the screwy rules and let go.  The hard core euro-gamers will want to pass on this one as it is nearly skill-less in it's implementation.  Good fun for large groups with a lot of time on their hands though.

an extremely weak take on the push your luck genre. yet get 0 decisions most turns, you roll until either you bust, or you are finally allowed to chicken out. most of the times it wouldn't be obvious if you want to go on or not the rules force you to go on. try any other of the myriad games like this instead of this particular one.

Of the various roll-the-dice-and-stick-it-out games, this is a quick, accessible, and very portable filler.  Doesn't beat Can't Stop or what is now called Incan Gold by a long run, but I don't really expect it to.

RATING: 6.5
Very enjoyable, quirky push-your-luck-ish game. It doesn't take all that long to memorize the odd scoring rules, and once you do, you're able to have some very odd table talk. Lots of variants possible, so game stays fresh. It's nice (but not required) to have a scoring board - I've got a nice, black Boston one myself.

Somewhat boring push-your-luck game.  Very few opportunities to mitigate luck... often you find yourself forced to keep rolling the dice and praying for a chance to stop and score.  It's not that you don't want to Wimp-out, but the game won't let you.  Has similarities with another game called "Farkel".

Components: Attractive, well-made dice, with fun symbols.

Experience: The various scoring methods make it fun to see what turns up in each roll, but there are so many obligatory rolls, that, being unable to back out, I feel the game is hardly of the press-your-luck variety.

Fun variant of Farkle that's best taken in small doses. The rules requiring you to continue rolling in many situations seems unfair compared to being able to stop at any time in Farkle. However, that actually ratches up the tension during play.

I've had this game for years and just now read the real rules.  Blah.  However, if playing it as a drinking game, this is a 10!!  Take the points you accumulate, divide by 10, and assign that many drinks out.  If you wimpout, you have to drink them.  Lots of laughs with a "happy" crowd.

Didn't realize I had rated so low...bumping up from 2 to 4.  The ridiculous rules are part of the fun.  The fuutless rule!  Good stuff.

RATING: 7.5
"Ten Thousand" variant with cool new age dice, but different feel because it is more luck and there is less decision making (reasons: five instead of six dice, mandatory re-rolls after "triples").  When played quickly it's a fun and press-your-luck game ideal for social and casual play.  Rules aren't as clear as they could be (note that [thread=81516]may not[/thread] re-roll any scoring dice).

The only decision is whether or not to press your luck and keep rolling.  The rules about flashes and YMNWTBYM sometimes even make this decision for you by forcing you to re-roll.  Yes it's frustrating, but it's exactly the point, because it raises the stakes: this rule forces you to play less conservatively than you otherwise might, and results in higher risks/rewards which does create more tension and excitement.  

I initially thought it's best played with "[thread=6518]Barnes Variant[/thread]" where players can also choose to re-roll scoring dice, but actually the game is best with the default rules that don't allow this and often force continuous rolling.  The decisions would otherwise be quite obvious and players would be more conservative; disallowing re-rolls of scoring dice actually makes the game more luck-based but more exciting and quick.

Versions playable with regular dice:
[gameid=3181] - Somewhat mindless version of "Ten Thousand" (also marketed as "Six Cubes", and sometimes known as "[gameid=11456]"), but a fun game for holidays, especially when combined with risk taking players!  
[gameid=11022] - A press-your-luck game (fun for kids) playable with two regular dice.  Rules: add up the points on each roll (doubles count for double points), rolling a 1 on any die is a "pig" and busts, first to 100 wins.

Variant rule: all non-matching dice = a Sampler worth 25 points (see https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Wimpout#Variations)

There's no particular reason why you couldn't play this game with regular six sided dice, but the cosmic theme is half the fun, with unusual symbols on the dice and, with deluxe editions, dice pouches and cloth playing maps to fiddle with.

Mostly a nostalgic rating, though I do play sometimes while waiting for food.  I tend to play a quicker variant of my own design called "Cosmic Chipout."  This game was a favorite amongst a small group of kids in my high school.  Like many kids from many generations, we discovered interesting "relics" from the past: The Doors, Pink Floyd, Cosmic Wimpout.  I have many good memories of this game.

I really dislike that you are often forced to re-roll even when you don't want to. (Futtless, Flash, YMNWTBYM, etc.) Once in a while would be OK, but this happens so frequently it takes much more control from me than I'd prefer.

Also, the rules make this game much more difficult to comprehend than it should be.

Fun, goofy, dice-rolling, "push-your-luck" game. Some local house rules are hilarious. In Columbus Ohio, when a "train wreck" was rolled, the poor sap would have to run around the house three times screaming at the top of his lungs, "Clear the tracks!" I guess you had to be there...

RATING: 6
First played this on March 27th, 2007.  I looked forward to playing this game after a friend had recommended giving it a try.  It's good fun.  It's easy to learn, quick to play (sometimes too quick).  There is a bit of strategy, however it's mostly the luck of the die roll.  I'd recommend giving this a try when you want a plain and simple game to pass the time and not have to think too much.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Ideal Players: 3-4

Description: Keep rolling the dice and accumulating points until you decide to stop or lose it all.

Pro: Great push-your-luck mechanic. Easy to learn. YMNWTBYM (You May Not Want To But You Must) forces you to roll sometimes, even if you would rather stop.

Con: Very simple game. No theme.

I can't justify Cosmic Wimpout as a "good" game. It's a push-your-luck dice game with no real decisions to be made, and yet I'll never turn down a game. For a travel dice game with some choices involved, I'd recommend Yahtzee or nearly anything else over this.

RATING: 3
Another push your luck variant of Yatzee, not bad for 1975 but not much to talk about today. Probably the worst of this type of game I have played, even "Monopoly Express" surpasses this, talk about a hit below the belt! 

Looks like Moon borrowed heavily (once again) from this and others to come up with "Cant Stop".

Initial Rating: 4.0 (October 2017)

Cosmic Wimpout was one of my oldest unplayed games. The box cover isn’t very inviting and when I opened it only 5 dice and a mat were inside.

The rules of the game are pretty easy, you can explain them under 2 minutes. Reading the rules from the rulebook isn’t as easy as it should be for such a simple game. They could be much better. Playtime is rather short (its best feature).

The game´s components are very regular although the dice are nice looking.

The gameplay is extremely easy but I thought it was going to be a fun game, it wasn’t. Toss Up! is a, somewhat similar but,  much better game. In Cosmic Wimpout luck reign supreme and you don’t have much decisions to make, even the decision of when to stop is often not up to you.

It has many variants and the game encourages you to make your own house rules, in general, that´s very bad for me. I always dislike house rules. I want clearly defined rules and boundaries, I don’t want to test new ideas, I don’t want to design a game, even a simple one,  I just want to play a well-tested game.

Bottom line, Cosmic Wimpout disappointed me. I already sold it and I don’t think I will ever play it again. Too simple, too much luck, too few decisions. If you want to play a “push your luck” game, play Toss up! Or Can´t Stop.

Current Rating: 2.5

My version didn't come with the scoring board I thought it would.  I might enjoy this more if we used the "house rules" you are allowed to make with certain rolls of the dice.

You have to bet to make this game a ten. 25 CENTS in the pot to start, 5 CENTS a voluntary wimpout, 10 CENTS a train wreck. I won the 1st (and last) WIMPOUT tournament in Cleveland and still have the wooden boxed custom-made board to show for it. I developed many custom rules I'll have to post on this site, you'll love the "make-it-up-as-we-go-along rule".

Press-your-luck dice game, like Farkel, made sillier by overblown terminology.  Not as much choice as dice-rolling cousins Choice and Can't Stop (and, like Choice, basically multiplayer solitaire), but still light-hearted fun.  (Or should that be light-headed?..)  Palm version available: http://docwhat.gerf.org/projects/cwimp  (the computer AI does sorta work; you can play against it, but it just stops rolling and scores as soon as possible)

I still get a little confused on the scoring because I don't play it that often, but I always carry a tube with me in my purse for such occasions as waiting for dinner order to arrive or waiting for a bus or Drs. appt.  Other people just stare at us, but at least my kids are occupied and their minds are working the math and figuring out chances (and not bothering other people while they do it).

Combine Yahtzee and Can't Stop into a faster game, involve rules which don't allow you many choices but rather follow a rule roadmap of whether you must roll again or most likely roll such that you lose your turn's points, and decide that you'd have a better time tossing playing cards into a hat than to play this particular press-your-luck game.

Better to play while drinking and trash-talking, according to Thoia.

I recently bought the tube package edition of cosmic wimpout, thinking we could revisit it, as it was a game my family enjoyed a long time ago.  We haven't played it (again) yet, but we did break out Yahtzee recently and lo and behold, what was in there next to the Kismet scoring deck (ha) - that's right, some of the original Cosmic Wimpout dice and the instructions.  Nice.

I'm not sure how we ended up getting this game or even hearing about it. Reading now that it was a cult phenomena in the Dead circles makes our obtaining it that much sweeter.  I bought this when it was released in 1984 (?) thinking it would be a fun game to play with the family.  It took off... and then everyone's true colors came out.  Who knew my Mom could be so cut throat?  She dominated at this game.  It was a fun time for all.

This game is an interesting little dicefest.  It's main advantage over similar press your luck dice games is that the rules hamper you from stopping when it is most advantageous, often forcing you to continue when you might otherwise choose to take the points and run.  I can see where the free-form variations in the rules might appeal to some as well -- just no to me.

Did we really play this that much back in the Eighties? I forgot that Cosmic Wimpout was so aggressively dumb and annoying to play. You are a slave to annoying re-roll rules that make it difficult to find an opportunity to make choices. Thankfully, there are much better dice games out there if you feel the need to roll the bones.

the worst dice rolling game, talk about pure luck. the only reason I play this game is because of Neil

RATING: 2
As I see it, Pass the Pigs has more strategy and tension:  in Cosmic Wimpout, you can do well or bust out while making scant few (or no) decisions about pressing your luck.  Plus, it's more complicated with far more bookkeeping.  No thanks.

Haven't played this one for years, but I remember it made for a fairly rowdy party game.  Seeing as I was an Idiot when I last played, I probably wouldn't enjoy it as much now.  Not that I'm not still an Idiot, but my tastes have changed.

RATING: 6
A fancied up version of 10,000, which we have been playing for years.  Despite the nice handkerchief, the pretty dice and the little leather pouch, I think I like the plain 10,000 better.  There is no reward in C.M. for rolling four of a kind and the "bringing flashes home" rules are a little annoying at times.  Also, you can't roll or score straights.  Fortunately, the rules allow for extensive rule modification, so I supposed I could put in new rules if I wanted.  Good for the glove box.

RATING: 5
Kockapóker a jobbik fajtából. Több érdekes megoldás is van benne. Szórakoztató, gyors játék, ami akár a megadott maximum 7-nél többen is lehet játszani, csak akkor kicsit nagyobb a várakozási idő az egyes játékosok között. Tökéletes átvezető.

Only played once a few years back. It did seem addictive (if not a little confusing). I have since bought it but haven't played again. EDIT: Just played again. Got really lucky on a roll where I scored like 622 points to effectively win the game. Still don't really understand the rules. Lowered rating to 5. There needs to be a Celebrity Cosmic Wimpout show on Bravo.

Press-your-luck dice game like Farkel.  Roll for more points or lock in what you have. It's got a few complex rules that don't really need to be there.

An overly complicated push-your-luck dice-rolling game. I've only played at GameTableOnline.com. There are enough rules about when to roll or not roll that it seems like, mostly, the game is playing you!

RATING: 5.5
[C3 Inc. Tube edition] {Dice, filler; multiplayer-solitaire, dice-rolling, press-your-luck; optimal 2-3p} Cosmic Wimpout is a classic luck-pressing game. There is nearly no decision at all. Very simple but players need some time to understand the rules.  It's quite fun and highly portable. Nice time killer.  It's exciting to know the result of each role and watching your opponents being forced to roll.

great push you luck game

RATING: 9
Theoretically this can handle an infinite number of players, but then waiting for your next turn would require an infinite amount of time ...  Good beer and pretzels game.  It's almost totally luck-based--there's a small amount of skill involved in knowing when to stop rolling and pass the dice.  This is a favorite of my gaming group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
You can play basically the same game with regular dice, but these dice look spiffier!  I wouldn't pick this to play over games like Pickomino or To Court the King, but Wimpout is an extremely small and handy size so it sometimes gets used for traveling.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A great game to stick in your pocket and whip out at a moment's notice.  A great push-your-luck game, with hippy flavor.  And great dice.   See my review: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/104955

Great game...which requires knowing when to stop rolling.  Which I don't.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Too many rules force players to keep rolling - Futtless rule, clear the flash, can&#039;t stop at the same point total as another player, etc. This takes the choices out of the hands of the players, and makes the game more complicated than it should have been. In all the games I played, there were invariably many times when I would have stopped and scored, but the rules compelled me to continue until I wimped out. I will pass on this one and play something where I am allowed to make my own decisions, thank you.

Rating is perhaps a bit skewed due to fond memories from my college days... but this remains a simple yet engaging dice game.

RATING: 5
Something about the proprietary dice, the mystique of the parlance, and the encouragement of [badly needed] house rules makes this strangely more fun than its distant cousin Farkel.  For a pure dicefest, Cosmic Wimpout sure has a steep learning curve!  Or maybe I'm just too square, man.

A good friend of mine owns the company, so at minimum I like it for that.  Wimpout isn't a gamer's game by any means but it can be a fun way to spend a while yelling at dice with people, and I love my bandana boards.  

Rules are a little harder to understand than they should be -- I've helped the company with an edit that will hopefully see the light of day at some point.

RATING: 4
I really loved this game as a kid, but alas, it's pretty easy to solve. Pretty soon, correct plays seem obvious, turning it into less of a "press your luck" game and more of a "see what happens" game.

RATING: 9
AWESOME GAME! Realistically it's about 65% luck, but the remaing strategy is fairly in depth, and the social aspect of the game is one to die for. Always, always, ALWAYS willing to play.

Nothing terribly wrong here with Cosmic Wimpout.  It's a simple press your luck die rolling game.  The game LIVES in the table talk though.  That's what makes it fun.  Small, quick, cheap and very light...nothing terribly wrong here.

Farkle clone: could be an almost perfect, original dice game, if it weren't for the ambiguous rules! 

(Long overdue) UPDATE: While the rules are written in a twee, flower-child manner, the bones of this one are quite solid (and no surprise, given the longevity of it's predecessors). I've really come to appreciate how well the PYL mechanic is handled here, and this has so far been very enjoyable family-fare whenever I've brought it out.

An 8 player game where my turn to roll the dice usually amounts to about 30 seconds and then it's 10 minutes before I get to go again. We do laugh a lot when we play so I guess it's not all that bad.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is a true classic! The tension as each roll progresses, the excitement as the dice tumble, the thrill of getting that "perfect roll", the heartbreak of the Wimpout! 
Great game with an unlimited assortment of "house rules" makes this the perfect game to play with old friends, new friends, family members, or just to kill a little time by yourself. It is highly recommended.

Good time killer and / or game for friends and family on rainy days. My wife likes this game and I can easily get her dead-head friends to play long. Kids like it too. I have several copies and I am rarely without a set of cubes. 

Also I have a great deal of fun inventing "boards" to score on. Making your own board painted on bandanas ect. can be a lot of fun. Use pebbles or "tumbled stones" as counters.

This is the pick up game of being "out".
Used in laundry-mats, restaurants: whenever we have 10 minutes or so of dead-time, and my wife has her purse alongside.  Bonus Points: the Kids love it too.

RATING: 5
Saw it at goodwill, and thought it would be handy to have odd dice.  Finally played it, and it's not horrible. It has become kind of a nice push your luck alternative in a variety of situations.  I am often surprised at who is willing to play.  And it can get really intense with the rules which don't allow you to stop pushing your luck even if you realy, realy want to stop.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A &quot;keep rolling until you make a bad roll&quot; game, with the added stress of some rolls forcing you to go on. I don&#039;t really find that sort of forced decision very fun, unfortunately. Very portable, though! Gets a bonus rating point for such lovely pieces.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
As far as press your luck (or press and pass) dice games go, it's a step above something like Pocket Farkel, thanks to the special Nova die, but it still falls short of something catchier or more novel like Pass the Pigs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Give this little sucker credit, it is fast, fun and light.  The set with just the dice in it is cheap, and well worth having.  Some in my group prefer Pass the Pigs, but I think I like this better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Online play only.

The ruleset is kind of interesting, but since it is a push your luck game, it has to implement many "features" to force people to keep rolling instead of taking their points (whether 10 or 100) and settle.  Tend to drag too often and pretty much devoid of any meaningful decision.

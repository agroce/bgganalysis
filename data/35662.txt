To tell the truth, I am surprised VPG released this game.  It is a Joe Miranda design, which means it is chalked full of innovative ideas.  That also means it is an underdeveloped mess.  Alan Emerich is one of the top developers in the industry: the kind of guy Miranda needs ([thing=41004][/thing] is an example of what happens when these two are clicking).

Instead, this game is incredibly luck-dependent and swingy.  If you go to the BGG Files section and try the Daniel Berger rules, it flattens this out.  In the end, though, I would rather play Julius Caesar.

Solid game for the price.  Modern version of the 80s microgames.  Simple and plays fast, but offers choices.  Cards add objectives to strive for besides pure combat.  Lots of randomness.

Most all of these Victory Point games are solid.

I wish the production values were much higher and I would pay more if they were.  As it is they are overpriced for quasi-non-DTP.

Fun game. I like the challenge of balancing the cards for your supporting factions.

RATING: 7
I like the system in this game in that it is not too complicated, but it reflects economic and logistical elements as well as the military struggle.  The Forum cards add a nice element making the game both a political as well as military struggle.  Only one play so far, but I can see this one coming out again soon.

Arrived 2 days after ordered. Read the excellent rules--I think I'm going to dig this. I also purchased the expansion.  I'm currently making wooden counters for it, and a large map--just about finished.

RATING: 7
(2008-04-14) My rating is based on a game a couple of weeks ago with a play-test copy and liked it a lot.(2008-05-25) Another game with my production copy was fun.  However, the forum cards don't work -- there is little incentive to spend so much money on them and doing so opens you up to a military defeat.  It thus remains a decent light wargame, but a large part of the design is irrelevant.(2008-07-02) After a couple of more games with the Silver rules and where somebody showed me how to use the forum cards to at least influence other game actions this game has grown on me, so I've increased my rating a notch.

Excellent petit jeu pour une soirée.
Les règles sont claires et les parties palpitantes avec de nombreuses possibilités pour les deux joueurs.
Une véritable très bonne surprise qui mériterait une version de luxe car le matériel n'est vraiment pas à la hauteur de la qualité du jeu.

RATING: 7
A fun, light and somewhat chaotic take on the Roman Civil War. Easy to setup, and fun to play. Just be prepared for a bit of craziness with the cards, and perhaps even the dice. Definitely more interesting than Columbia's [i]Julius Caesar[/i] in my opinion, and at half the cost.

I definitely recommend playing with the Silver rules, as the Bronze rules are a bit too simple.

Update: I've had to dock this game a point due to balance issues. Too often Caesar will roll up Pompey with his superior forces and additional card draws. I've actually developed and playtested some variants (available in the files section) that make the game much better overall.

Played with Bronze rules only. Very interesting, quick playing little wargame. Neat decisions need to be taken with the Forum card mechanics. Looking forward to trying both the Silver rules and the Gold expansion kit.

RATING: 7.5
Quite good for a short and simple game.  It can be very short if both players seek an early decision in Greece.  If the game lasts beyond that initial confrontation, the cards can guarantee at least one significant setback for each player.  The competing victory conditions, Political and Military, are a big plus because they create tension by multiplying threats without complicating the game.

Good fun and more historical than the Columbia game. The combat system is very overwrought and wristy and needs streamlining.

PbeM suitability: good, except for combat - but set up some suggested guidelines for where to take losses etc. with your opponent, and you should be OK.

I've played a couple of games using the Bronze rules and twice with the Silver rules. Caesar XL is a light and fun wargame. The element of chance is high, with some of the cards being especially powerful. This can be frustrating but, on the other hand, it provides a few twists and turns to the course of a game. Overall, a fun game if you do not take it seriously.

RATING: 6
An enjoyable and easy to play offering.  Play it with the silver rules - they're only another two pages but add much more decisionmaking to the economic processes in the game.

After giving it some more thought (and plays), I think forces are a bit too mobile in the silver game and not quite mobile enough in the bronze.  Silver sees a rapid march by Caesar into the east to crush Pompey, while Bronze makes it much harder for Caesar to get there before Pompey rebuilds.  As a result, the forced marches in silver tend to stereotype play, which is a suboptimal result.  Units need to move about 50% faster/slower than either set of rules allows.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
For a small game, there's a lot there.  Caesar's talent vs. Pompey's gold makes it an interesting mix of strategies, and the random element of the cards makes every game different.

RATING: 8.1
This game produces great drama. Fun, fun and very fun two player game, being able to start with the simple rules and build up to the full game allows anyone (non gamers) to learn and enjoy the game. The multiple ways to win is a big plus allowing for lots of replay ability. *My wife and I play this often enough that we have laminated the map.

Joseph Miranda on the Roman Civil War...cool!  

The recent game of Julius Caesar (Columbia Games) gives me many perspectives on the struggle between two ancient giants.  I wish to know it more.  This one should be added to my collection.

[b]5: Average game. I'm indifferent, but may be willing to play.[/b]

Playing with the full on Gold and Silver rules, there is a lot of game here, don't be fooled by the packaging. To be honest, I think this game could warrant a full on GMT production and larger better laid out rule book. 

That being said, given the theme and attempting to learn something new, both my wife and I would rather just play Julius Caesar (Something we know and covers much of the same time period). Time is a huge commodity with our 1 year old son and learning something new just isn't as attainable as it used to be for the time being. Definitely does not fire Julius Caesar theme wise for us (Although to be fair, the theme and area movement are the only two things really in common with the two mechanics wise).

Think a shortened version of House Divided set during the Roman Civil War with some cards thrown in for added fun.  Skip to the Silver Version.  Nothing new or exciting here but it is an enjoyable little wargame filler.

Very enjoyable.  Simple rules and an easily playable system.  Lots of surprises from the spqr cards, but to me that is part of the fun.  I definitely prefer the Silver Rules over the Bronze unless they are needed for teaching purposes.  

Reduce the luck with the variants in the file section.

Easy to learn and get into playing, but even with the simpler (Bronze) rules, there are definite decisions to be made each turn. Plays quickly, and simple enough that one can quickly concentrate on game play rather than rules-check--although the printed rules are quite clear. So, it's a nice game that can be played in about an hour. Rated it a 7 initially (Dec. 2102), but after repeated plays, impressed with how well play-tested this must have been, as it plays out differently every time, so, in October of 2014 I raised my rating to an 8. (And that's just with the basic--Bronze--rules.) Purchased new, on sale, July 2012.

This is a fabulous light strategic wargame that should appeal to Eurogamers, with the low counter density and straightforward mechanics.  The SPQR cards and the interplay between military and political victory are quite inspired.

A very big game in a very small package! Just goes to show that really good design can transcend size and component limitations. Replayability is high thanks to the cards, and complexity is not, thanks to the design. The 45 minute playing time is a little [i]optimistic[/i], at least in my experience. However, the game can end early through card-play and/or circumstance. A great little game and Victory Point Games is now one of my favorite game publishers!

RATING: 8
Chaotic and fun.  The +/- values of the "forum cards" will provide a lot of playability for a war game this small.  You can go for a political victory by satisfying conditions of  "forum cards" that are played or you can go for a military victory and own a number of keys.  Expanded by the Gold expansion.

This is a fast playing light war game that in some ways is simply amazing. For the small map and the low density of pieces, there is a significant amount of depth and challenge. I find the game enjoyable and perfect in the amount of time a game requires.

Only played solitaire so far, but I found the game to be interesting and fun. The scaled complexity of the rules is a good idea and allows for a pick up game to be played relatively quickly. The size and packaging of the game also lend itself to being taken on trip and easily set up. I ended up sleeving my cards as they were a little flimsy. Also the print and cut job on the unit markers are pretty low quality and it distracted from the overall appearance of the game if not the game play. 

I have picked up the Gold edition so I'll have to give that a try to see how the added rules and cards play out. 

Gold rules add some further dimension to the game. The only real criticism I have is that the gold rules should be a roll up of the bronze and silver instead of having to flip through three sets of rules to check on something. Good game, only played solo, but still entertaining. 

Recommend the purchase.

Really packs a punch for such a small game. Offers multiple decision trees, and is easy to learn while providing rich gameplay. 

There can be some WILD swings during the game, so neither side should give up.

Note that their is an expansion available that specifies Barbarian units for each tribe, and these hordes can even now wander the map.

Production values aren't that great (poor actually).

I wish that a different company would pick this title up in order to give it the treatment it deserves.

RATING: 7
Rating after just two plays.  First game was "Bronze" rules, and I found it more like a "6" rating.  A bit flat with those rules, but they are just to get you setup to learn the real game.

Second game with "Silver" rules was much more exciting.  A number of new activities you can take part in, and the Barbarians keep it interesting.

Szimpatikus játék, mert egy rendkívül érdekes korszak (Caesar és Pompeius polgáháborúja) egyszerű és elegáns feldolgozása. A játékmenet gördülékeny, a szabályok csiszoltak. A csatákban azonban túl nagy a szerepe a véletlennek (bár ez éppenséggel korhű is lehet). A kellékek (térkép, jelzők) szépek, de a kivágásuk pontatlan.

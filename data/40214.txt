Finally played it after picking it up at a convention last year. I thought it would be a good game to play when our kids get older, but now having played it, I don't think I'll have the patience to wait that long, and by that time, would rather introduce them to better games, anyway.

The rest of the group wasn't crazy about it, but i liked it.  The production quality was very good.  There were a lot of tough choices to make, and the board state keeps changing via trading posts being built and deliveries being made that change market prices.  And of course, like any good euro, there aren't enough turns to really do all that you want.
Edit: Played again, with a new group, and everyone liked it.  The biggest complaint was it is too damn short (< 1hr with 5 players)

151117 the elephant cube pushers are cute but that's about all I remember aside for the inofensive gameplay.

120908 3 is a little low, so maybe I'll bump it back to 4, but either way, its not the type of game I enjoy.  I suspect that pick up and deliver is just not one of my preferred mechanisms.  Its cute, and the elephants with two cube baskets are awesome tho!

like: fast. easy to see combinations
dislike: very light and some randomness, but the map is the same each time.
Overall: it's a quick pickup-and-deliver game that has some varied scoring mechanisms. it's ok for what it is, but play can be calculated easily for min/maxing. would play again, but i can feel it doesn't have longevity.

I think this game gets a bad wrap on BGG for no reason. I've watched The Dice Tower review of it and one of the main gripes of the game was the "pass and gain 1 coin" issue. Ending the game with 18 coins is not good or "decent" in any way. I feel if this is an average score for people then it shows that this game truly does have a learning curve. It's light enough to be explained to newer gamers with enough interesting decisions to keep them engaged.

I love the fact that I'm managing such a small amount of actions in order to try and make the most money possible. Palace placement needs to be balanced with buying and selling. Competing for city tokens is also crucial. This game is fun, tense, and fast. I'd liken to Metropolys, but I find Metropolys to be a bit deeper and a bit more engaging. Still, this is a great game.

A decent, relatively short pick up and deliver game with limited action points that can be spent as you wish on each of your turns.  The plastic elephants, which can carry cubes, are definitely amusing to move around the board.   Bombay feels like a game designed back when "decent" was enough; however, these days, Bombay feels a bit dated and simply not enough fun to want to play again.

I've now played Caylus, Mykerinos, Yspahan, and this.  I've looked into plenty of Ystari games too, and I think it's safe for me to conclude - for my tastes - that Caylus was an outlier.  "The new Ystari game" shouldn't mean much to me anymore.  I think this was playable, easy to teach, and quick to play.  Loved the elephants and mini-cubes in particular.  In my 4P game each player got 16 turns, most of which were spent doing half-motions to set up for other turns.  Not a lot going on, and particularly not a lot that I thought one could do to really separate themself from the pack either tactically or strategically.  Cute and boring.

The first Ystari release to miss the mark for me.  There is too much that you can't (afford) to do or can do but is either not optimal play or helps an opponent.  AP can set in.  I couldn't detect the fun factor.  Look great as always with an Ystari game.  Colour me disappointed.

Fantastic game.  Not so simple as it is described.  Yes, rules may be easier than any other Ystary's, but decisions are constant, and it is not obvious what to do to win.  May play quite differently depending on the number of players.

A fairly short game that, at first, seems rather complex (maybe it is just the way the rules are written) but is actually a pretty straightforward pick up and deliver game with a number of paths to victory.

As ever with these things, the key seems to be plotting an efficient path and hitting markets when your goods are worth most.

A very quick game once we learned it...I would almost call it a filler, actually.  I enjoyed this one (played with two).  Not a ton of deep thought, really tactical...I could see this being really good with three but more than that would be quite chaotic.  The way the markets worked was pretty cool.  I'd play again.

Clever and interesting, but it seems flawed.  The start player and 2nd player seem to have an advantage because there are two excellent places to drop toll booths and the rest are mediocre.  Related to this is the fact that the connections on the board seem imbalanced because two cities have only one way in and out (resulting in one person getting paid tolls both ways instead of being able to split the tolls between two players).

I really didn't want to believe all the bad reviews and took a risk with a cheap copy on Tanga. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The rulebook was terrible, and did not make clear how to alter the game for three players. I still don't really know if we played right. 

Regardless, you have so few things to do on your turn that the game really does get boring after just a couple of turns. Pick up a cube, go deliver a cube, maybe build a palace. Really a boring game.

A so-so pick-up and deliver game, which is a genre that I'm usually a big fan of.  This one would make a great family game, as there's very little to it other than picking up cubes with your sweet plastic elephants and transporting them to cities which utilize a very simple supply and demand system.  Overall, the game is alright but is probably helped a lot by the cool production value.

RATING: 5
Sadly my one game didn't go over too well with the others. It seems highly tactical. The hidden info also seems unnecessary. I think the problem was the game looks all fluffy and family, but it doesn't feel that way. It feels very dry. You go somewhere, pick up goods, either deliver them somewhere else or use them to build a palace (and in that case the good doesn't even matter, so it seems the non-optimal thing to do, except with goods that must be delivered far away). There just doesn't seem to be much overarching the whole thing. Other than dropping of the palaces (which doesn't affect the game much, or at least the feel of the game), there doesn't seem to be much development during the game. You kinda just figure out what's efficient for the round (3or 4turns), and go do it. In my one play, nothing others players did really affected you much. That is, you can see when players are going to deliver something, so you simply don't plan to deliver the same thing to the same place. Very few surprises. Having said all that, my rating seems a bit generous, but I think the game is actually decent, but the folks I played with need to warm up a bit more.

This is a straight-forward pick up and deliver game with players moving bales of silk around India by elephant.  To keep things interesting, there are shifting market prices every round for the various colors, and each city has a constantly shifting demand.

Along the way players may choose to use some of their silk to build palaces - those provide income every time another player passes through, and the space may also have a reward token, such as an extra client.  At the end of the game bonuses are handed out to the player with the most palaces and tokens, and also the person who visited the most cities first.

There isn't a lot of depth here, but it is a tightly designed game that will be more intense with more players.  Let's face it - what makes this game are those elephant tokens.  SO CUTE!

(review after one play with 5)
Simple rules, but engaging. You play a merchant, traveling the province of Bombay by elephant, and need to earn the most money to win.

Money is earned by trading silk in different cities, first having bought it in a trade settlement. Additionally you can earn money by building a palace on a road and get paid by the bank whenever one of your competitors travels by. And of course, the players that have sold in the most cities or have the most palaces earns some 'prestige' money at the end of the game.

So you must invest money or silk (to buy the silk or build a palace) and effort/time (going to the city or trade settlement, buy silk or build palace are actions, and you have only 3 actions each turn) wisely to be efficient.

So far so good. But luck may play a big factor in victory. Different silk colors are sold for different prices, the sell prices change each time when a sell takes place, the buy price changes every set, silk of a specific color  is only sold in two of the 10-something settlements, and sold in 3 of the 6-something cities. And the 'produced' silk changes every three turns (= a set; after a set next player around the table has the advantage to start the next three turns playing actions). So, if you are located too far from the settlements that produce the currently available silk color, or too far from a city that buys it, you are disadvantaged. As you can only guess which silk colors will be produced next, I find luck playing a big part in the game. 

The random factors represent nicely the real life of a merchant: buy and sell prices differ at a given moment and change in time, availability differs, everything you do spends your limited time and effort. But the playing time of Bombay is too short to factor out luck and let the best merchant stand out.

Two little changes might make the game more strategic: 
1) Still choose the produced silk randomly, but place them one set in advance as a 'preview' of what is coming up the market soon. That way merchants can maneuver to the most interesting places in Bombay while finishing their current trades.
2) The taxes paid when passing a palace should be paid by the traveler, not by the 'bank', although not so much as now (1/4 Roepie e.g.), so choosing the traveling route will become more important.

Merchants in the land of India. In this pick-up and deliver game the players seek to acquire goods at trading posts and deliver them to the cities where they are in demand. Of course they must do so on Elephant back and along the way they can build Palaces, which can earn them riches should the opposition be forced to travel through them.

I'm really glad I picked this up as a gift for a friend who is new to the hobby. 

I think the error in the rulebook (orange side of palace tokens for 2/3 players!) did this game a lot of damage on BGG. I would venture to say that everyone who voted 'not recommended' for 2 missed the rule correction. It is clearly a 'best with two' imo. The heart of the game is planning out your entire route (12 actions) at the beginning of each round. With one opponent this leads to some fun screwage; with more I think you'd just see your plans go up in smoke every turn. The first player has a slight advantage so best of 3 matches seems like the way to go. That should take about an hour.

The comments about being able to pass each turn and still compete with a score of 16 (2p) are simply inaccurate. The active player would make at least 4 sales for 8 rupee profit at a minimum, take the 8 rupee bonus for all four cities, and take the 4 rupee bonus for most palaces/clients. That's 20 pts at the absolute least without making any effort at all. We've never seen a score below 16. The strategy would simply never work. 

Likewise the comment that palaces aren't worth building is way off. STRATEGY SPOILER: [A palace in the middle of the board can easily earn 4+ rupees of passive income over the course of the game even with just 2p. Matches are very tight so the 4 rupee palace/client bonus is crucial.  You have to gauge the potential profit and try to win the category without overkilling it. If you build more palaces than you need to win the bonus you are wasting potential profit from sales.] 

All in all a quality gateway with great bits that is a fantastic value at the current blowout prices.

There's a simple action-point system, and the market system includes some supply-and-demand, but the main thing I like is that you can build palaces which function sort of like toll booths.  Placement of those can be the key to winning.   If it was any longer, I'd like it a lot less, but at 30-45 minutes, it's just right.   Good for what it is, but nothing terribly unique or inspiring.

A bit dry and analytical for my tastes, but not a bad game at all. Gameplay has some clever aspects. The color choices bug me a bit. Namely, the board itself is very vivid and coloful, making it a bit hard to see the player's pieces in ivory, brown, black, pink, and gray. Also, the tiny cubes in the markets are hard to see against the vivid, colorful background in all but perfect lighting. 

UPDATE: The more I play, the more I like it. There are some very subtle aspects which are not immediately apparent upon reading the rules and playing a single game. Rating may continue to go up over time.

Könnyedebb játék, mint Ystaritól megszokott, igazi családi játék. De jó ötletek, szép kivetelezés -csak ne lenne olyan büdös az új műanyag-. Ugyanakkor az h tényleg az elefántokkal visszük a bálákat, aranyos és jó.

This is a fun little game with elephants moving goods around the board to earn money. You can block trade route and force people to help you generate money by building palaces. Depending on which goods and where the goods are on the little palaces you receive income and maybe chits, which go towards end game VP.

RATING: 6.6
Provisional rating. I made stupid errors in my first turns which annoyed me, since the game turns out to be quite short and so your range of choices is tight. It's a cube pusher, and the map is very asymmetric, so it may stay annoying. I actually had just ordered a copy online and then got to play it. I'll try it again soon to see if I really like it or not.
***
Played again, with 3 players. Had the advantage of knowing what to do, still came 2nd by 2 rupees. It's interesting me more, but I can't decide whether the shortness of the game is what makes it something or nothing. Either it's that you're pushed to make fast/hard choices, or it's that the game is determined by the random set up and who goes first. If the cube markets are close to the cube buyers, optimal decisions seem obvious. If they are spread apart, then the game needs more moves, and tightness of actions forces your tactics. Needs another play!

This is a great sort of family or lighter gamers game.  Short, but still some interesting decisions despite luck in what cubes come out.  The elephants are super cool.  I really think this game is underrated, though I say that viewing it as light game.  Played from the gut trying to fit in just the right cycle among the other players is intriguing.  There are so few games I like under a 7 average rating.  I have a feeling the stupid issue people where having with not being able to score better than what you can get from just passing is the reason it's rated so low.  I think too many people judged it prematurely.  Recommended with 4 or 5 players.  3 is okay, but there's just a lot less going on.

Pick goods up for cheap, move them where there is demand, and sell them for more. While that is at the core of pretty much every game in the genre, it is rarely this bare-bones process itself that is the interesting part, and neither is it in Bombay.

This game is about squeezing the most out of your severely limited actions, and outperforming your opponents at the same time, usually but not always by simply being faster. This race to the honey pots is fairly often decided by turn order, so it's good that there is an alternative path that forgoes immediate gains in favour of a larger end game bonus. Still, the decision for which path to take seems like less of a deliberate choice and more of a strong suggestion by "the circumstances." While that doesn't exactly make the game arbitrary I have a feeling that it contains far fewer interesting decisions than it appears at first glance.

This is one of the kinds of game I like... I really like games with pieces that you get to move from point to point on a board.

I really feel after one play that this game hits a lightweight pickup-and-deliver sweet spot: There is some planning and some choices and it is a "perfect information" game (with hidden scoring to help prevent super-over-analysis) which could be a problem for AP players.  However, it's not so involved that the bit of analysis that is necessary can't be quickly.  The bits are beautiful and it plays fast.  I really like it.

I would not play it with a super-optimizer though...

Not the high point in the Ystari line but a good game nonetheless. And the components are fantastic - it's plain pleasure to open the box and start a game setup.

The game itself is a nice mix of family game and some hardcore-eurogame. The scarcity of money and actions makes it hard to play for a casual player but it's still accesible and fun.

There are not many strategies to win but as the play lasts less than an hour - why not? I will play it although I like it a lot less than Mykerinos or Amyitis by the same publisher.

A simple pick up and delivery game. Not terribly challenging, but enjoyable if in the right mood. The elephant figurines have little built-in baskets on their backs to hold the cube cargo they're transporting. Genius design! However, be warned. The reports of stinky rubber game pieces are true. I had to let the things air out for about a week before it mostly dissipated. Tom Vasel griped about the ability to get points by doing nothing for your round, but I promise you won't win this way.

My wife loves India, and so, in the tradition of giving me gifts that she might like, I received Bombay. Despite the attractive box art, it sat unloved in 'the dark place' for some time before we decided to give it some attention.  As a simulation this works well; it's a 'pick up and deliver' game which moves slower than hippo post in a tropical storm.  The most fun we had was deciding what to do with the elephant models after we barbecued the game board.  Decorations for sub-continent themed cup cakes anyone?  It's remains were,for a while, consigned once again to 'the dark place'.  On the occasions that I entered that sullen hole I would catch a glimpse of its shadowy form beseeching me to show it mercy.  Shuddering, I finally gave it a descent burial.

Könnyed családi játék, nagyon szeretem. 

jem magazin 6. szám http://jemmagazin.hu/magazin/page/2/
Ebben a szép kivitelezésű családi társasjátékban a játékosok kereskedőkként elefántok hátán barangolnak Indiában, hogy selymet vásároljanak, amit a városokban értékesítenek. Amikor rajtunk a sor, szerezhetünk pénzt, mozgathatjuk az aranyos (vagy ahogy lányom mondja: cuki) elefántunkat,vásárolhatunk selymet, eladhatunk selyembálát, illetve a tábla különböző pontjain palotát is építhetünk. Palotáink jövedelmeznek is számunkra: akkor kapunk értük rúpiát, ha ellenfelünk arra jár. A játék végén a palotákért, ügyfelekért és városjelzőkért is pénz (vagyis győzelmi pont) jár, és ez dönti el, ki lesz a nyertes.A játékot 2-5 fő játszhatja, és a játékosok számától függő, hogy a játék hány fordulóból áll. A fordulókon belüli körök száma is a játékosok számától függ (például 3 játékosnál 5, 4 játékosnál 4 körből áll), de az állandó, hogy a játékosok minden körben 3 akciópontot költhetnek el. A kezdőjátékos (akinek személye fordulónként változik) a paravánja mögül kitesz egy körjelzőt, és a három akciópontját elhasználhatja a következőkre:
● Elefánt mozgatása az útvonalon: Egy szomszédos csomópontra érkezés egy akciópontba kerül, míg a fennsíkra érkezés két akciópontba kerül.
● Selyembála vásárlása: Ha elefántunkkal egy nyitott kereskedelmi központba érünk, akkor megvásárolhatjuk a központ színének megfelelő színű selyembálát
● Az elefánt hátán lévő selyembála eladása: Bálát csak olyan városban lehet eladni, ahol arra kereslet van.
● Egy palota építése:
● Ha végképp nincsen jobb ötletünk, akkor mindhárom akciópontot beváltva kapunk 1 rúpiát a
bankból.
A játékban több jó mechanizmus is megtalálható, amelyek
szórakoztatóvá és változatossá teszik a játékot. Ilyen a selyembálák
árának fordulónkénti meghatározása, vagyis a kilenc véletlenszerűen
kihúzott bála ára attól függ, mennyit húztunk fel belőle, illetve a
többi színből. A másik az eladásnál a kereslet állandó változása, tehát figyelni kell az eladás megfelelő
ütemezésére. Az egyes színekhez járó bonuszok is fontosak. A játékban összesen 17 bála selyem, vagyis
kis kocka van: 3 sárga, 4 lila, 5 kék és 5 narancssárga. Ezért a ritkább színek eladásakor bonusz jár:
A játék egyszerű mechanizmusa és színvilága (rózsaszín, sárga, babakék színű elefántok) is jelzi, hogy ez egy családi játék. Aki ennél komolyabb, fajsúlyosabb játékra vágyik, vegye elő nyugodtan az Ystari többi játékát. De akik szívesen ülnek le egy olyan gyors, könnyed, családi játékkal játszani, amelyben a gondolkodásnak is van helye, és már a 8-10 éves gyerekek is élvezhetik a játékot, azoknak nem fog csalódást okozni.

I would argue that the game is quite deep. You have a very limited amount of actions and limited and ever changing resources on the board. You have to constantly adjust your strategy to do well and also keep in mind what the other players will do, so that you don't waste any of your own actions (like going to a cheap silk station, only to find that someone else has bought the last one!). Granted, you don't have to calculate the water consumption of the Italian army, based on Pasta use, but it's got a lot of depth.

Not only is the game deep and interesting, but it plays in under an hour, has great bits, and the theme is one that makes it attractive to people who otherwise wouldn't want to play an action management, pick-up-and-deliver game.

I think this game would be a perfect next step that would also be interesting for "gamers." I know I'm certainly interested in it and enjoy playing it.

Wow, talk about unadorned.  There is just not much here folks.  More players = more time, which is very disappointing in a game of this weight.  If it was clean and short, we might have something to add to the shelves.  But this is minimalist pick up and move without having tackled questions of downtime.  Its tactical nature keeps the interest between turns to a minimum.

Seems like a decent family game.

I'm not the target - this game is not for die-hard gamers.  There is too much luck in it.  Impact of (un-)favourable showing up of goods in cities in such a short game is enormous.
There is also a problem with the most lucrative (2?) places for palaces - if someone builds there, his income is increased beyond any reason in comparison to others building in other places.

Setup was difficult for me the first time, because I felt that there was lots of terminology...despite the really well done graphic of setup.  You may not struggle.

Once I started playing the game and realized what the symbology on the back of the player screen meant (this shows - graphically - how to conduct any action you want to take on your turn) I really loved the game.

It's a case of "hard to explain cold" vs "easy to play once 1 player has played it before".  Several groups of new players have tried, and loved, this game.  Highly recommended.  If you don't have a "pickup and deliver" game in your collection it's a MUST buy.  If you've already got one or two, think about this one.  It's easy to play, quick, elegant, and the components are fun.  And pink :)

Bombay has gorgeous bits and very clear player aids, although it has some deep in it, I feel it is too light for my taste, for me it´s more of a family game, easy to teach. I do like the fact that, unlike other games, the down time is very short, the game can run smoothly and you can finish a 4 player game very quick. I´m not crazy about the theme but it serves its purpose.

I will play again thanks to the short playtime, but I won´t request it ever.

I am a sucker for a game with a pretty board and nice pieces. So when I saw this one in the GenCon Auction store I picked it up. Actually then I put it back on the shelf and waited for the price to come down the next day then I purchased it. A couple weeks ago while camping we got it out onto the table for the first time. The board itself is really nice, the elephant figures are perfect and the baskets on top hold the wooden cubes that represent bails of silk. It is a pickup and deliver game were each player gets to be the start player for a set number of turns before it passes on to the next once each person has gone first the game is over. For us with five it was 3 turns each for a total of 15 turns. Its rules are simple, and the playing time is short. But you have to watch the people around you, it is a timing game and you don’t want to be the second player to get there. In the end everyone enjoyed it and the score was close. Contrary to Tom Vassals review, the winner had far more than the 15 points you can get by doing nothing each turn. It will be back out on the table soon.

My enjoyment of Bombay flitted into existence for a but a moment as I looked over the colorful plastic elephants and dispersed as soon as the rules explanation was underway. My primary bone of contention is that the game feels like a tight, up-hill, Age-of-Steam-like slog packaged as a cutsie SdJ game. It's pretty to look at and fairly straightforward to play, but progress is slow and opportunities for success limited, nixing any narrative arc. The euro-blender of scoring mechanisms made me feel like I was playing a phoned-in Knizia effort. In a nutshell: not much to do, not much time to do it in, racing to markets before other players drop demand for your goods, clogging the paths of other players with "palaces" which collect points for you if other players choose to travel through them, collecting a set of tokens for an endgame bonus. I rate it a generous six for pink elephants and accessibility and strongly suspect that another play would drop it to a five.

On reflection, there's absolutely no reason not to rate this a 5. One of the blandest games I've come across in the last two years.

Bombay had to miss most target groups. For occasional gamers it's too thinky and dry, for experienced gamers it's not deep and variable enough. Still, it's a fine pickup and delivery game when you're in for some puzzle solving challenge of optimizing your route while being one step ahead of the competition.

COMMENT:
A light pick-up-and-deliver game with simple mechanics. However, there is far too little time to do what you would like to do in the game, so planning your moves is crucial. In sum, a very tight game is created in which you are always attempting to maximise income by skillfully outmanoeuvring your opponent(s). Beautiful artwork and game pieces. An enjoyable game.

A very odd game.  The absolute need for efficiency can attract the serious gamer, but the relatively simple rules and plastic elephants make this a good candidate for a family game.  I need to play this a little more, but for some reason I feel that it wouldn't be entirely satisfactory for either type of player, though I would like to try it with non/new gamers just to make sure.

My copy came new with a piece missing: a green city counter.  This only affects 5-player play, so it shouldn't matter much, but it was disappointing.  Also, the plastic pieces have a strong smell which I hope will go away soon.

Nagyon pozitívan álltam hozzá, de sajnos nem volt olyan jó élmény. A játék gyönyörű, és nagyon egyszerű, vannak benne jó elemek, de valahogy nem igazán történik semmi, a körönkénti 3 akció kevés dologra elég. Mivel a játékidő rövid, nem olyan fájdalmas élmény, de ezzel legközelebb csak gyerekekkel játszom.

Comment I should add more weight ratings. I found this lighter than Dice town but apparently a lot of users don't agree with me on that.


THe fixed number of actions 64 in a four player game adds some tension but on the downside makes the ending anti-climatic. Almost forced. It's over when there is still a lot to do. People can play the game without building a castle and end higher than a person who builds all his castles.  To me that doesn't seem right. (in agricola you can see who won in 95% of the cases by looking at the farms....)

ANyway it is a quick playing family game. 
I won't suggest this again. But if I ever have a family I'll gladly play it.

edit december 2015 : found a family to play it with it.
Reread the rules, saw toms video. Before playing this again I have to say that the pass action works well. It allows you to do stuff , chicago express has a similar mechanism to put money in a company.  
If you continue to pass each round , stay at home. I'll play in your place and wipe the floor with you.

The game because the limited actions is not as light as you might believe. The game spins a delicate web of opportunities and pitfalls. Carefull planning is key. The experienced player will see this and will crush his opponents who are one step behind.
Play may become sort of scripted what to do the first couple of turns in a game, setting up for more options during the game.

This might have gotten better comments if this was a winsome release ... 

I still have issues with the end look of the game and the scoring.
But probably my biggest problem is that the game is over while there is still plenty to do. 

The most impressive part of this design is the round and turn order.
The round with the four turns is prove that setting up plays is key in this game. People calling this a light game are wrong. I was wrong. Because it is hard to pull off people mistake this for a light game.

 The person going last in round one will be making a comeback in round four.
Somehow I feel the game could have benifited with a layout of two or three less available spots. Manoeuvring takes up too many actions.

I adjusted my weight from 1 to 2

A rather simple pick up and deliver game with beautiful bits, a restricted number of moves that makes planning very important and a rather short playing time. Con: it takes too long to set up the board. And 5-player games tend to be unbalanced. Not by a lot, but it seems the starting player is unlikely to be last and the last player is unlikely to be first.

I'm finding that I enjoy the simpler fare that Ystari puts out.  The stuff they put out with layer over layer of different mechanisms leave a sour taste in my mouth while their simpler fare of this one and Yspahan are far more enjoyable.  I definitely want to give this one a go to try some different strategies.  I think it is too easy to get caught up in building palaces that one loses sight that the largest value is delivering goods for money which translate into straight up points.

Easy to teach, easy to play, Bombay is also a very beautiful game with nice plastic elephants.  The game is primarily tactical in nature with limited planning for the future.

The components and artwork definitely seem to squarely aim [thing=40214][/thing] as a new gateway game entry, filling a similar role as other light games like [thing=9209][/thing].  The board is nice and colorful and the elephants (which literally  carry the deliveries!) are a great addition.  However, the tile markers are a little generic and it's a little easy to confuse them with each other.  The set up is a little fiddly as well---it's probably going to take a couple of times before we can set the game up without referring to the rulebook in detail.

After playing a couple of games, we found [thing=40214][/thing] fairly decent, but just missing a little something.  The variable market was a nice touch.  However, it did remind us of other "obtain cubes and trade them in" games like [thing=40628][/thing] or [thing=66188][/thing].  However, [thing=40214][/thing] doesn't quite have the simplicity and elegance of [thing=40628][/thing] but doesn't have the complexity of [thing=66188][/thing] with all of the modules added.  Yes, yes, those games don't have the movement aspect of [thing=40214][/thing], but the movement portion didn't stand out as much to us as you're not building routes or laying track.  That being said, we definitely enjoyed this more than Hansa, another comparable pick up and delivery game.

As a two player game, [thing=40214][/thing] works fine, although it does feel pretty tight.  There doesn't feel like much time to build up your deliveries or palaces before the game is over so the game is actually fairly brutal, although this does sound like a common feeling across all player counts.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's surprisingly not a bad game. Firstly, I love the elephants and there's even space for them to carry the cubes around the board. Secondly, this game plays fast. The AP is reduced as you only have 3 costs to move per turn and so moves can be easily thought out in advanced. All in all, this game can be a quick and fun filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Surprisingly and unexpectedly and amazingly tactical. Very interesting mechanics - I was hoping for so much more, or even just a little bit. The game has an abrubt feeling at end game if you can't make good use of your final actions, which may be due to bad planning or chance.

The best feature of the game is its short length. Because of that it will get more play. And therein may lie its proper worth - not a bad thing at all.

DON'T FORGET: The rules have an error with regard to the Yellow vs Orange side of the tokens (Yellow side for 4-5 players, Orange side for 2-3 players).

2011 Update: Have taken this game out again and have been enjoying it. Raised rating from 6 to 7. The most recent outing was a 2 player scoring 26 to 14, a very interesting score.

This game nicely encapsulates both everything that's lovable and everything that's wrong with your standard, mid-level Euro. The artwork is lovely - richly detailed, stylized without being cartoonish, and consistent in tone. The pieces are wonderful - sturdy, elegant, and totally idiosyncratic. And the conceit of riding your elephant around participating in the east Asian silk trade is totally original.

As for gameplay, it's...well, matrix arithmetic, basically. Minimal theme, minimal player interaction, zero suspense. The "restock" phase provides a little variety and unpredictablity, and if everybody plays with a minimum of tactical competence, the endgame can turn into quite a close race. But the mechanics don't have anything more intrinsically to do with the theme than they would if the game was about were escaping zombies, harvesting rutabagas, or running in a horse race. Oh well.

beautiful looking game. Again, LOOKS GREAT plus cute elephants.

Dirt cheap (but see CON)

CON:

Stinky pieces (http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/773217/smell)
Despite the cheap price (see PRO), I can't imagine that we don't have other "light" fare games in the library that would be equally appealing to a younger or less-gaming oriented group. See http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/798276/bombay-as-a-gateway-game-too-fiddly
Possibly too fiddly for what you get (http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/798276/bombay-as-a-gateway-game-too-fiddly). 

CONCLUSION: Save the $12 and use the $ for something that is higher up on the want list.

Initial impression is pretty good - I enjoyed the game quite a bit. It's low luck, fast paced and under and hour. It's got a simple enough ruleset and pretty bits so that non-gamers would be fine, but enough tactics to hold the attention of gamers. I hope to try this as a gateway game. I really haven't found a Ystari game I haven't liked.

An excellent pick-up-and-deliver game.  What really sets this above many others in the genre is it's simplicity.  On your turn you use your action points to move your elephant caravan, purchase goods from the market, sell goods at a city or build a palace (where you'll receive money when players travel through your palace on future turns).  

There are only four goods and their prices in the buyers market are determined by the the number of goods that have come out each round compared to other goods.  So rarer goods cost more and goods are paid for by both rupees and actions.  The prices in the sellers market are determined by the markets need at the time.  Once one sells a good at the market it's value moves to the bottom (so it's worth the least).  The changing markets create an urgency to time the selling of your goods.  At each market there is only one good that can be bought and three that can be sold.  

Beyond that there are some set collection aspects, etc. for end game scoring.  It plays within 30 minutes.

Az Ystari eddigi legszebb játéka. A grafika csodaszép. Élmény ránézni. Két dolog miatt vesztett pontot nálam. Az egyik visszakanyarodik a grafikához. Nem lehet könnyedén a különböző színeket megtalálni. A másik pedig, hogy sokat kell tökölődni az előkészületeknél. Viszont kötelező plusz pont: a játékos segédlet a paraván hátsó oldalán. Kevés az olyan játék, ami ennyire segítené a szabályok elsajátítását.
update: Az első tesztek után sem kellett visszavonnom a pontszámot. Üdítő a játékban, hogy gyors, viszonylag egyszerű, és mégis van benne mit gondolkodni.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Very light pick up and deliver game that uses an action point system to limit a player's options in a single turn.

Does the usual things for a Euro, offering up end of game bonus points (rupees) for having the most palaces + client tokens. Bonus points also awarded for having visited 3 or 4 palaces where palace tokens can be gained if goods are sold there.

Goods are bought at marketplaces that are dotted around the map. Once at a market a player can buy a good of the designated colour. The ost to buy it depends on where that coloured good sits in the marketplace boxes at the beginning of the round. Of course the best option is to buy low and sell high. 

Selling goods is done in cities and each city has a supply and demand track, making different goods worth higher and lower income when sold. When a good is sold in a city it drops that good's value to the lowest rung, thus relicating a basic supply and demand cycle.

It's all pretty basic stuff but the one interesting element is that player's can build palaces in open areas. This costs an action and a good (which means no income for a sale), but whenever another player moves past your palace on the various paths, you earn one rupee from the bank for the passing trade. 

Given that rupees are the end game victory condition, careful placement of palaces is key. 

One redeeming feature of the game is that it plays very quickly, in about 30-45 minutes. A player's turn can take literally 1-2 minutes tops as it is quite obvious at times what your best move is in a given turn. 

That makes Bombay a perfect game for lighter gamers or the family/gateway crowd. But I don't think this will be anywhere near interesting for the Age of Steam/18xx crowd.

Bombay is a very simple pick and deliver game with fluctuating market prices. Using your limited actions and loading space, you need to move your elephant between markets and palace building spots and beat your opponents to the best deals. My only complaint is that the game ends a bit too fast but then you have time to play it again.

In Bombay, one is moving their elephant around to trading posts to pick up goods, delivering goods to earn rupees, or building castles with goods. When you deliver goods to a city, you get a corresponding city token if there are any left, and you don't have one of that city already. At the end of the game, more city tokens are worth more money. Also at the end of the game, your sum of castles and clients gives you more money as well. When you build castles, opponents must pay you 1 rupee to enter that location.

It's a fairly clean pick up and deliver game. I have some slight concern in that the first player has an advantage in getting to the palace tokens first. Or you could be going last in the first round, which means you will have less good building spots.  But I'm enjoying playing this so far as the mechanics are easy.

Interesting filler game that fits the same space as Metropolys in terms of "filler games that are about 10 minutes shy of not being a filler game".

I like -- the pieces are gorgeous, the board has its clearer choke-points and the mechanic is probably even better when randomized.  I won by one coin.  I'm not certain that any actual atrategy led to that victory, or if it was pure luck.  So this is a game that your 10-year-old son could win just as easily as grandpa, and I respect that.

If it's at typical Ystari price, though, it's too expensive.  This game should top out around $30.

Simple pickup and delivery, with very nice components: Seems that they got some help from Matagot. 

Surprisingly good when played in 30 minutes but gets worse very easily if there are any AP prone players present.

Nice, light, & fun pick-up & deliver/commodity game.  After all the negative reviews I've read, I was very pleasantly surprised.  After reading the rules on-line, it sounded pretty good and played just like I thought it would.  Pretty good if you take it for what it is...

A good (certainly pretty!) pick-up-and-deliver game. The rules are not brilliantly written, and some of the cardboard counters are confusing (why are they all round?). We worked out the rules confusions and it was OK. 

We played with five players and it was very quick once we got past the first round. This certainly isn't a long, deep game, but it was purchased as a 45min filler and for that it is excellent.

This is a weird one to judge. I have these preconceived ideas of Ystari. Complex mechanics, tight gameplay, excellent theme. I'm a big fan.

But this disappointed. The production is first class, the gameplay itself is reasonable. But it's not an Ystari game for me. It's too light and fluffy, and over way too quick.

You get lots of small turns travelling around the countryside, buying different coloured goods at trading posts, moving to cities where they're in demand and selling them, or using them up to build tollhouses to gain ongoing income when opponents travel through them. Most money wins. It's mostly about lots of little races, about working out whether you can buy a good and get to sell it before your opponents in a city where it's top dollar, or whether you'll travel more efficiently (less helter skelter) and settle for lesser amounts, but more of them. It's pleasant enough and all over quite quickly, way quicker than the advertised 60 minutes. It's in that meaty filler territory where it works well. Being a light vanilla pick-up-and-deliver, it just doesn't provide enough differing interest from game to game to warrant a lot of replay though.

RATING: 7
A fun and very well-designed game. Plays fast, handles 5 players well, and has depth with multiple paths to victory. It is probably the best 5-player game I own. Best with 4, very good with 3 or 5, and good with 2.

There are likely to be a couple turns each game where you get a minor brain-burn, trying to plan your moves over the next turn or two for maximum efficiency. People prone to AP will slow the game down somewhat, but a 5p game with 2 players with minor AP still finished in 65 minutes. There are definitely long-term strategic decisions, as well as short-term tactical.

The 2p game is more cutthroat than I had expected or hoped, because there are not enough city tokens to go around, so you have to grab those as quickly as possible. But you also want the most client tokens. And of course you need money. It's not "mean", as there are only occasional opportunities to screw another player without hurting yourself.

The game flies by, and you don't have much time to do stuff. With 2p, palaces are unlikely to collect much, the city demands don't change often, and goods are rarely out of stock. With 4 or 5, the income from well-placed palaces can be substantial, the demands are more likely to change before you get to a city to sell, and at least a couple goods run out every round.

A 3p game with 2 first-timers took 35 minutes. Our 4p game with 3 first-timers only took 50 minutes. A 5p game with 3 first-timers and 2 minor AP cases took 65 minutes. 

The plastic components (elephants and palaces) had a strong plastic odor. Washing them and airing them out for a few days in the sun helped, but not a lot. After a few plays and a few more weeks in the box, the odor is no longer strong.

I like my Time Track variant (posted in the forum).

It is pretty complicated for a "family" game, so I would give it a weight of maybe 2.3 instead of 2.1.

The elephants are cute, but their baskets could have been a little larger.  It was difficult for fat adult fingers to get the small cubes in and out.  The palaces seem to be a key piece of this game; make sure you build yours in a high traffic area so that you earn lots of tolls.

I'm hesitating to rate this game until I've played it with more than 2. With 2 it was dreadfully boring, with no tension and straightforward decisions coupled with arbitrary scoring mechanisms which led to a ho-hum reaction upon discovering the game had declared me the winner.

Edit: I played with 5 and the game was definitely better but too short for my taste. It's just not my cup of tea but good for players in the mood for a quick pick-up-and deliver game.

A good medium-light game that the whole family will like. the rules are clear and well explained. The material is good looking, specially the little elephants. The game mechanic is realy simple. The only problem is that the first and second players seems to have an advantage as they are the first to gain access to the goods (cube) to be able to build palace on the best locations on the board. This will mean more money and more possibilities to buy or sell goods. Still a very enjoyable game the plays in around 60 minutes.

Un bon jeu moyen-léger pour toute la famille. Les règles sont claires et bien expliquées. Le matériel est beau, spécialements les petits éléphant. La mécanique du jeu est simple. Le seule problème qui semble ressortir est que le premier et second joueurs semblent avoir un avantage car ils sont les premiers à avoir accès aux cubes (matières) qui permettent éventuellement de bâtir des palais sur les meilleurs emplacements sur le plateau. Ces palais permettront recueillir plus d'argent augmentant les possibilités d'achats et de ventes de cubes. Reste un jeu agréable qui se joue en environ 60 minutes.

Jogo que deve ter sido uma das inspirações para os primeiros da Mesaboardgames, numa mecânica simples de "apanha aqui e entrega ali", enfeitada por um molde engraçado para palácios e elefantes, iguais no formato embora nas cores dos cinco jogadores. De destacar a forma de flutuação do mercado, as diferentes combinações na distribuição dos tokens e, acima de tudo o mais, a funcionalidade dos elefantes, que carregam mesmo as mercadorias, num molde feito de propósito e a rigor, que ajuda a disfarçar um jogo previsível e que chega a ser enfadonho...

Decent game I picked up for cheap on a tanga sale. Most of my plays were using peakhope's solo play variant (slightly tweaking as I went) and that was interesting enough for a half dozen or so plays. 

Played a few times against actual other people and found it to be easy enough to explain that casual gamers (family) put up with playing it and everyone enjoyed it. 

I wouldn't mind playing this a dozen or so times against the same opponents to see what type of strategies or group-think develop, but doubt I'll ever get that opportunity.

Rocko says: misleading

Dont bother with Bombay- just get Merchants, the faster and more fun version of Bombay without the board or the  boredom!

Ive lowered the stats for this game- if you follow the rules its kinda boring and a drag every time you play... we havent played it again in a year cuz its boring.

However, if you use 5 moves per turn instead of 3 the WHOLE game changes and its actually a TON more fun. FYI.

---
We played this at UCON, and won it as a prize to take home. Both of us loved it: the game is beautiful, the pieces are good quality (though some cubes are Tiny), and most importantly the game is lots of fun. Simple mechanics with multiple options for building, trading, and sometimes kind of sneaky even.

We have also played Merchants, and Bombay is quite a lot like that game, only with more options, more strategy, and more groovy ways to mess other players up. 

2 player is cut-throat, 3-5 player is interesting strategy. Even doing well it is hard to tell who is winning sometimes because even a tiny mistake can cost you, and its boring lol.

Easy to learn/teach. I expect to be playing this game with gamer friends, non-gamer friends, family and children for many years. I was wrong. 

There is a rules clarification you should be aware of- and lolz, and we all noticed this while playing and kept going huh? What in the world were they thinking...?

Official Errata from the maker's website:

Please pay attention to this adjustment:
In 2-player and 3-player games the palace tokens are placed orange side up, while in 4-player and 5-player games, they are placed yellow side up. Thank you.

Original game is not bad. The problem is that it isn't particularly good either. It's sort of solidly in the middle. That said, the game may be much better using the time track variant, described here:

It may also be better with 5 actions per turn instead of 3.

No one can win by consolidating their fortune each turn. This was a play with 4 newbies. It seems the complaining is pointless.

After viewing the [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2wUO6pMWZs&feature=player_embedded]Tom Vasel's review of the game[/url] I thought that it wasn't for me, but only one play was enough to prove me wrong, even when it is true the fact that a player may not have anything better to do than pass in his/her last turns.  Pick and deliver in its pure essence; very light, but with a lot of strategy to improve your moves around the board, keeping an eye open to what your rivals are doing.

A light, quick, family-oriented pick-up-and-delivery game that's quite fun - adds a bit of set collection, variable victory conditions, and route optimization too. It works well as a gateway game but feel as satisfying as some of the heavier games I have.

Some have complained about the fact that a player could just pass and collect a victory point every turn, thereby  collecting 18 victory points for doing absolutely nothing. I have no idea why they think this is a problem - in our first game, the [i]lowest[/i] score was 19 with the other three scores throughout the twenties with the winning score being 29. Therefore, by doing nothing and collecting 18 victory points, you will most likely lose.

A játék komponensei nem olyan szépek mint az a képekről gondolná az ember. Olcsó műanyag helyett esetleg jó lett volna pótolni műgyantával vagy valami kellemesebb tapintású bármivel. A többi komponens tökéletes, egyedűl a színhelyesség zavaró néha. A játék nekem felhőtlen szórakozást hozott. A 3 akciópont körönként bőven jó arra, hogy az ember ne kombinálja túl magát, ezért hamar lelépi a körét. Első játékok bőven 1 óra alatt lementek a szabály magyarázattal együtt. Ha valamihez hasonlítanom kéne, akkor a Himalayat mondanám elsőnek. Ahogy változik a termények értéke az eladásnál, ahogy kikerülnek a piacra a termények mind-mind erős párhuzamot adnak. Családi játék, mert könnyű a szabályrendszere, viszont nem ajánlott vérkomoly gémereknek.

Reminds of Hansa in a way, though I like Hansa a little more.  Have a certain number of action points to spend on your turn, so efficiency is key here.  I like the tradeoff between building palaces and selling cubes.  I also like how the cubes can vary in cost depending upon how many of each color are available.  It's a little too constrictive of a game for me to love it and it feels like I've been here before in a way.  Also, I won despite passing the final two rounds, so that's not the most exciting endgame :)  A fun game that I like but just don't love.

Preliminary rating after one single play with 2 players. First of all this is one of those games that shouldn't be played with two players. It gains a lot when played, this is just a guess, with at least four players.
Second and for those who don't know it by now this is a simple pick up and deliver family game.

I have some doubts about the board and its design. I'm not sure if it works well. I have to play it again. It seemed a bit too difficult to move around the board but maybe it is as it should be.

Played it again with 5 players. It's much better I think dispite of the incresing of the downtime. Much more tight and fun to play with a lot of Palaces on the board making much more sense the payement of 1 coin to the owners. Maybe the perfect number to play this game is with 4 players.

[Asmodee 09 edition] {India; pickup-and-delivery; optimal 3-4p} Bombay is a pretty family game.  It is light and interactive.  A game is short, around 40-60 minutes.  There are at least 4 ways to get coins - road, commodity and end-game bonuses.  Not a bad game, but it's not special enough for me.  I usually don't like Ystari games (except Caylus).  This game is no exception.

Game play is quite boring because competition between players is not as strong as other pick-up-and-delivery games.  Players can usually do what they want.  Tactical options are limited as it is quite obvious on what one shall act and a game is too short to build long-term strategy. Replayability is quite poor (esp. with static set up).  The theme is just non-existing - it's not coherent with the game at all. 

It is too expensive!

Bombay is everything that a light, family-friendly pick-up and deliver game should be.  The board and pieces are really nice to look at which pulls you in.  The rules are easy to teach, yet offer some tough decisions.  The game length is short enough for short attention spans.

This is a great game and I'm really glad I purchased it.  My wife loves it so I think it will see a lot of action in our house.

Visually attractive but overly simplistic game. The aim is to transport bales of silk on an elephant to one of four Indian cities. The silk varies in value depending on the city it's being sold in and the market availability, which is determined at the start of each round. The key to success is to buy cheaply and sell the silk for the best price, which is in the city where it is most in demand. The scoring feels flawed as you just don't receive enough rupees/VPs for selling the silk in relation to the game's rule that states you can forego your turn in return for one rupee (that happens to be a valid tactic because you'll end up with a score of 18, which can be competitive). Once you've played the game a few times you've seen pretty much all it has to offer so replayability is also limited.

The first two plays didn't really impress my wife.  I wonder if we are doing something wrong?  I can see what the game is doing, and she can see it at least when I explain it in an over-view, but it goes really quickly. I know it is supposed to be short, but it feels like we can't finish.  I don't know if that is us or the game. I think I can fix my issues with some house rules to lengthen it.

A rare miss for Ystari, which has been on an incredible roll of late, having published a number of absolutely terrific games in quick succession. Bombay, unfortunately, isn't in the same class with Caylus, Caylus Magna Carta, Yspahan, Mykerinos, etc. First, there's a balance problem. With an expeienced group, the first two players will dart out and build on the busiest intersections, thus collecting a steady income throughout the game and gaining a nearly insurmountable advantage. Balance aside, there just aren't enough options for players - there are so few choices and so few turns that there's not much to satisfy here. It plays quickly, which is a plus, but otherwise this fell very flat for me.

RATING: 4
Not sure I get this game.  I would love to play a good, competitive market driven pick up and deliver game (and this one has decent bits), but Bombay seems to miss the mark.  This is due in part to the passing rule, which is a little odd.

Or maybe we just messed up a rule or two.  

But honestly, it is just a run-of-the-mill game that looks tremendous, and plays way below its pedigree.

RATING: 3
The components are fun (plastic elephants that can carry wooden cubes) and the game is nice and light. It does seem to be a little too restrictive, though. It can take three or four turns just to pick up a cube, move to a different part of the board, and make a delivery. I know that the game is meant to be that way, but I prefer when a game feels a little more open. Still, I'll see how this holds up after some more plays. 

Sold.

What a very very ok game. I get it's a 'family' game and maybe it was Ystari's attempt to a SDJ nod or something but even at that level is was really just OK and not reaching up the level of 'good'. Needs to have at least 4 or 5 to play well though.

RATING: 6
Ystari's first take on the pick-up-and-deliver genre, and also their first take on the family game field. They've done blind bidding, worker placement, area majority, and auction games, with varying levels of success, but this is both their simplest game yet and their first foray into the world of pick-up-and-deliver. Surprisingly it was reasonably enjoyable, better than many other Ystari titles, but not as good as the few that have been worth purchasing. It was a fairly simple game of wandering around the board with your elephant piece, picking up wooden cubes of various colors, and bringing them to the designated place to sell for a variable amount. There's a decent amount of interaction since players can not only try to beat others to the punch in getting and delivering cubes, but also since players can set up tollbooths along the way that collect when opponents pass through. As long as everyone keeps it moving at a good pace this game works and seems to accomplish what it set out to do, so it's just up to you whether a simple pick-up-and-deliver game is something that interests you.

First off, the little elephants that carry cubes on their back are cool.

Bombay is a pickup and deliver game where most money is the victory condition. You're trying to sell cubes that are most in demand. Every city has three cubes it wants, and as you sell a cube it moves that cube to the bottom of their demand order. Cubes further up the demand order sell for more cash, although there is a booby prize for selling the least demanded type (a client token).

Every round cubes come out and are ordered from least expensive to most expensive by rarity. Then you spend action points to move, buy and sell cubes. You can also turn cubes into palaces, usually for a bonus thingy, and palaces give you toll revenue (which is paid from the bank).

At the end of the game you get points from money, and there are bonuses for whoever has more Palaces/Clients and for who sold at the most places (except you don't get credit for being the last person to sell to a place).

Bombay evoked a lot of what I like about pickup and deliver games, and I really liked the market and demand mechanisms, but it felt a little flat. I would have liked a route building aspect. As it is, it leaves me wanting to play a better pickup and deliver game. It might be a good game for introducing new gamers or family to that genre though.

Not enough plays to form a solid opinion, but at first blush, this Ystari big box game is not really targeted to a hard core gamer audience. This pick-up-and-deliver game is relatively short, which is a plus. However the decision tree can be quite complex (multiple paths to victory) given the simple choices available. For the first play, it feels like the game ought to be slightly longer. As players construct palaces, collect patrons and and slowly build up trade routes, the game ends. I got trapped in an undesirable location slightly further away from the good markers and my final few turns were meaningless. For such a short game, those wasted turns were devastating. Perhaps this was a fluke. More plays needed to form an opinion in the game.

Multiple ways to score, lots of tasks to accomplish within a very tight timeframe. 

I espeically admire the price mechanism for purchasing goods.  Then there is another simple pricing for sale of goods. That already goes beyond ordinary pickup-and-deliver, but then other scoring elements are included too - collecting two types of tokens.

I suspect, however, that many will dismiss the game simply becuase there are so many rules compressed into a quite short playing time, so the payoff might not be viewed as sufficiently gratifying.

Colourful. Perhaps too much. It's sometimes hard to see the paths along which your elephant moves. Nice pieces but that doesn't mean that it plays well. A lighter Ystari game and sort of has a Ystari feel. The box could be smaller and made more portable like Clans. A good game but not one that I would want as part of the collection.

This is a pick-up-and-deliver game with some room for planning, and opportunities to hose other players.  It reminds me a little of Valdora, except this offers more opportunities to mess with other players, and more directly.  The palaces are a nice twist, especially with that choke point between the two halves of the board, but it seems like the game would be better with a theme of urban deliveries, with the palaces being toll booths of some kind across the board.  I don't think it's the theme alone that turns me off on the game a bit, but it just doesn't thrill me.  It works, and I would likely play it again, but ... meh.

I chose this over Valdora because it has elephants in. Valdora also has nice components, but while I'm not the fussiest when it comes to theme application by a long shot, it still is a bit odd that you pick up gems just lying around on the lawn XD Bombay has great charm, is easy and plays swiftly, perfect for many of the groups and sessions I run.

Update (Nov 2013):  Playing with [article=7181137]Peakhope's Time Track variant[/article] really improves the flow of the game.  Highly recommended variant.

The exotic (from an American perspective) theme and the thematic pieces and board are the game's biggest draw.  There's quite a bit of setup, but the pickup-n-deliver and marketplace mechanics are straightforward.  Unfortunately, the spending of each turn's allotment of action points feel stilted and a player often ends up wasting action points to do what they want/need to do.  That said, I've been playing this game quite a bit and it was a pretty big leap in gamedom for my 6yo daughter.

Despite the presence of elephants, the delivery system isn't nearly as frenetic and exciting as the open field warfare in Return of the King.

A tanga deal and great components got me on this one... and the kids already like playing with the elephants! The game itself is over fairly quickly which is nice... and there are some good decision points as well... but overall each turn seems very samey and our first play left us all a little flat.  We might have to wait until the kids are just old enough to handle this before really getting maximum use out of it...

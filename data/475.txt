I'm starting to think that Reiner should change his name to Solid Knizia because this is another one. Very slick but again just lacking that spark (or maybe theme) that puts it into the next bracket.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Set collection with bluffing and multiple paths to victory.

Game is divided into 12 rounds (provinces) which are determined randomly.  You visit each province sequentially, and on your turn, choose to play a card(s) or withdraw.  You always get cards at the end of your turn, but the last player gets one less card, and if you outright withdraw you get one extra card.  There are multiple ways to score: winning a palace placement, and thus a character chit (2 chits equate to a special powered card), items that are available within the province upon placements (ie: goods, +2 points, free cards), palace connection points (which are cumulative), and the elephant tile (which contains goods that are cumulative).  Also you are awarded points for the largest consecutive run of cards at the end of the game.

In order to have any power in this game, you must have cards, but cardplay must be of the same colour, and you can also combine these with the coveted white cards.  There is a significant bluffing element as well, as the other player's don't really know what you have or how much you're willing to play.  It should be noted that all cards played (except the special whites) are lost, win or lose.  It pays to be the last man standing, as you will often be the big winner of characters, goods, etc.  

Overall an outstanding game that is highly strategic, and yet not overly heavy.  Masterful in that it's a card-based game that is skill, rather than luck driven.  Scales very well for 3-5 players, despite rumours to the contrary.

Excellent, excellent game. I suspected I'd like it after reading rorschach's opinion, and I wasn't disappointed. I love it!
The combination of the need for a strategy, with the need to change it all the time as the game progresses, the tight bidding mechanism and balancing the knowledge that just one more card will win you the lot with the knowledge that you really can't afford it...
Sweet sweet game.

RATING: 7.5
This is very much a first impression, but I feel positive about the game so far.  Boy is there a lot going on.  I hadn't really got a clue what I was doing for the first 3 or 4 turns, but started to get a grip on it after that...well at least enough to finish second and improve my scoring dramatically.  Since it's a quick game and pretty brain-burning, it's hard to get fully to grips with on first play.There is a lot going on here and yet most of it whilst vaguely familiar seems utterly new.  There are elements of poker, elements of chicken (maybe a few ideas that Iliad has since borrowed), elements of building long links (not exactly TtR, but kind of along those lines).  Despite that, I didn't feel that any of those similarities are very strong and the game is really very different form other games I've played.  I like it, but how much I like it remains to be seen.

After one game: Fun bidding game, but prefer Ra. Bidding is for "political position" in city which grants you a building in the city.

Kinda neat game, and it confirmed that I take 3-4 plays to figure out the patterns in new games.  Looking back, the strategies just didn't register in my mind, and I couldn't even see what they were based on others plays, so I would not see myself introducing this to other players due to that barrier of entry.

It could be that I simply don't understand this game and how to play it, but there are other games I picked up much faster and enjoyed more, so would not want to own this.

Played this with 3 players and we all enjoyed it. The cards could have been better designed - too plain looking and we kept getting confused with the special cards and the oval marker pictures at the bottom, which were often mistaken for the real thing when played. The little oval markers are too small and two of the markers look so similar (we call them bagpipe guy and pants dude). The scoring mechanism is better than T&E and Samurai because it just makes more sense and the majority of points are distributed with each province visit, meaning that there won't be surprising point gains at the end of the game.

UPDATE: May consider ditching this one too, it's good but the design is really distracting. It'll go to the top of my wish list if it gets reissued. The Knizia name may be enough to make it a keeper. UPDATE 2: Too drab and plain ugly to keep - yes, a game has got to look half-way decent for me, otherwise I won't care to introduce it to others. Getting rid of this, but will repurchase as a redesigned game.

One of the worst rating I've given, it was on my watch list, I'm happy I tried first. The best comment of the game was in the lines of (when the game ended): "This was long and painful". It's really an abstract game, with a lightly pasted theme. the theme doesn't even make sense to me. Sure, the mechanics works, but it felt like work, not like fun.

I still believe this was more fun when we had the rules wrong.  We played it for 50+ games scoring each palace, rather than each region you've added palaces to.  No longer are massive wars fought over a region because two players are winning 4-5 points per palace.

Sort of an auction game, and sort of not ... the card play somewhat resembles trick-taking and pushing your luck. Interesting, also, in that you'll pretty much have to sit out some turns (unless you like wasting cards) and you have to figure out which auctions you want to go big in, and plan for those. No real theme and the gameplay is a bit dry, though. Still, a unique system and a fine implementation of it.

Perhaps not one of Reiners best, but still worth playing now and again. Not a game that I often win, but usually come a close second. I guess I'm not really that into bidding games.

My initial comment demonstrates not only the dangers of making snap judgements, but also of how my tastes have developed with experience. It was made not long after I'd discovered BGG and regular boardgaming - several years later I now think this is a nailed-on classic and one of my favourite games. I must have thought it had some potential as I didn't commit to a rating.

After 1 play with 5 people. I don't think I fully got this one. My first impression is it has a convoluted scoring system which isn't particularly representative of what appeared to be a semi-chaotic card game. Probably sour grapes because I came last, but I would like to play again with fewer people.

Love the long term strategy involved. I can't pick any faults with it apart from it is a little on the slow side. There is quite a bit of board chores after each auction. Everyone needs to work together in re-stocking the cards and the auction tiles, also pushing scoring markers and re-organising the special cards. It will take a few games to get this one running smoothly.

decide what you want to do, talk about it, note who is ahead of what, pick a temple spot, pick cards, trade out special cards, count your chains, etc.  when i look back after a game, i find that most of the play time was spent on everyone doing simple accounting.  the sheer volume of it presents an illusion of depth, but the only decisions i feel like i ultimately make are what to go after, and how far i'm willing to go if i meet resistance.  everything can be distilled down to that level of simplicity, but i care about how much time i spend between decisions - or at least how entertained i am between them.  i like the tension of what's underneath if you strip away the distractions, but then what do you have over something like beowulf or condottiere?  i can dig those, especially the former.

It's tense and unforgiving, and planning out your present and future turns requires consideration of card color, card symbols, palace location, and a bunch of other important factors.  Most (good) games start out calm and have a gradual increase in excitement and tension.  Taj starts out tense right from the beginning, and doesn't let up.  Like other reviews have said, the magic number for this game is four players, but I had a pretty good time with three.

While I can appreciate the elegance on this design, I simply can't seem to have enough fun with it.

The concept is great; and it's got those agonizing decisions I love... but, in the end, it's a bit too ruthless and unforgiving, leaving a player who made a few bad choices agonizing and longing for the game to end, which can last for an hour longer or so.

Egy tipikus pontgyűjtögetős befolyásszerzős Knízia. Ebben talán hiányoltam a igazán eredeti ötleteket, amit tőle megszoktam. Érdekesség, hogy jó előre lehet tervezni, mert a játék elején látható, miért fogunk küzdeni az egyes körökben. A speciális kártyák egymástól való elrablásánál több interakció lehetne benne.

Másodjára se nyűgözött le, de kicsit azért feljebb pontozom, nem volt olyan rossz.

Harmadjára... kezdek rájönni a mélységeire. Zseniális, hogy ilyen egyszerű szabállyal ilyen viszonylag bonyolult játékot lehet csinálni.

This game is very cool.  It is simple to teach and a quintessential euro.  The game is very unique and full of tense decisions.  I like the aspects of bluff, pressing your luck, and knowing which battles to pick.  The game has a very nice balance of strategy and tactics.  This game is so fresh and full of original mechanics.  I really really like this game.  I like the card management aspect of the game as well.  This game is deserving a spot in my collections.  It is just a shame that it took me this long to try it out.  We did play a few rules wrong though.  One of them is that the Crown Palace cannot take a bonus tile.  Another is that you cannot just hoard influence tiles so that you can keep your special card.  And lastly, the end game scoring which gives you points for the cards in your hand.  I am looking forward to the next session very much.
Initial Rating: 8 

Feb-01-08
Finally played again and with the right rules.  I like it with the right rules.  The special cards moved from player to player more and you had to plan when to take it because others are 50% in taking that special card from you.  Also, getting points for the cards that you have in the game might give you just enough points to win if you decide not to fight for the last province.  This game reminds of Age of Steam in terms of relatively simple rules for the depth that it provides.  This game is also so unique that it is very refreshing to play.

Feels different than any other game I have played.  It is kind of a mix between poker, hand management and auction.  I really liked it although it is not without some minor flaws (art, can get behind without abilities to catch up, it is not a game I go away from itching to play straight again and the design is optimised for 4 and does not scale brilliantly) but its is fun, tense and different.  Some more theme and more differentiation between the different things you compete for each round and this would be even higher but already its a game I can see my playing a few times a year and enjoying each one.

{3P: ???, 4P: 10, 5P: 9}

The [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/2]good Doctor[/url] has designed so many games, that it's difficult to keep track of them all.  With such megahits as [i][thing=42]Tigris & Euphrates[/thing][/i] and [i][thing=12]Ra[/thing][/i], [i]Taj Mahal[/i] had slipped through the cracks of my consciousness.  Ironically, I had picked up a copy over three years ago as part of the [family=58]Alea Big Box series[/family].  Only after a concerted effort to explore this game did it finally make it to the table.

Was I ever wrong to wait.  [i]Taj Mahal[/i] belongs in the pantheon of Knizia greats.

The auction mechanism is both agonizing and efficient.  On top of that core mechanic, the game is about "chain scoring:" linking your provinces together, or collecting commodities.  With four players, there is a perfect balance between the ability to extend an auction at the risk of losing premium temple placement within a province.

Recognizing potential chains then leads to hand management, so that you have the necessary cards to compete in those provinces.  The long term strategy merges beautifully with the tactical considerations of each auction.

[i]Taj Mahal[/i] is an amazing game.  I'm tempted to rate it a "10" out of the gate, but I don't want to be too hasty before trying it with three, and with five players.


[i]Updated 4/3/12, Rated: 9[/i]

I finally had the chance to play this game with five.  It was a learning/re-introduction game, so we weren't playing anywhere near optimally.  The one thing that stands out is that the auction can be brutal if you have that many players: if someone chooses to go long with you on a particular province, you can be left with nothing after having spent a lot of cards.  I think the risk/reward ratio is better with four players, which is why I'm rating the 5p game a "9" while the 4p game is a "10."  Overall score: still a "9."

Fun game, a bit confussing in the first round but once you get it down, it's pretty fun the card bidding system, when trying to plan out the strategy on the board as well as which provinces to claim with the elephants that will get you the most money, plus the bonus cards you get for having a pair of the chits.  I would definately play again, although I like T&E better in Reiners Relm of medium to heavier strategy games.

I believe this game, along with T&E, are the most brain burning of the Knizia games. There is SO much going on here (area control, winning "tricks", trying to get the special cards, etc) that it can be a bit overwhelming for newbies. But by my groups 2nd game (I did a solo learning game), everything went smoothly and we had a blast. Can't wait to play again.

RATING: 8.5
After a long time of having mainly new-ish titles as the main course on our game nights, Tadsch Mahal came back onto the table. When you get caught up in all the excitement about the latest bling, it can be easy to forget exactly how enjoyable some gems of the past were. Tadsch Mahal had slipped so far down memory lane that most of us needed a serious rule reminder before play commenced. And it does say something about its graceful aging that just over an hour later we were all caught up in mutual enthusiasm, not too dissimilar from when we played it first time round. Auntie Alea is still looking good.

This is probably more a board-driven card-game than vice-versa. Handmanagement is the name of the game. The board mainly dictates the order in which sets and bonus events will become available. It also adds another way to increase your overall score to standard set collecting, by stringing regions together with effective palace placements. You're gonna have to pay close attention during all 12 rounds, and the most important moment happens right at the start: figuring out your rough strategy for this set-up, and what the crucial provinces are for which you'll have to be ready. This, and roughly a dozen plan-B's.

We're blessed to have a group in which all player's are capable of winning in all sorts of ingenious ways, and everyone will do their bit to stop a runaway leader from emerging. That does certainly adds to the joy that can be had with this game. Not only does it offer a variety of plausible strategies, including some for the more -ahem- [i]enterprising[/i] amongst us, it also means that no player is likely to benefit disproportionately from someone else's bad moves. With the right crowd it will inevitably lead to memorable and tightly fought contests. But on the flip side of that same coin, it is also likely to be a spoiler when the makeup of a group is more diverse.

There is one masterstroke in this game, and it's how the auctions are resolved. It's not the player who ultimately ends up with the largest majority in a colour, who will take the spoils, but the player who has a majority (or majorities) during their turn, and decides to cash in rather than keep fighting for further spoils. It is a subtle variation on trick taking that can make a few well-chosen cards utterly superior against players who think that simple card-hoarding, or even card-counting, will give them the edge in a decisive endgame.

A lot of people here call it, quite rightly, a game of chicken. Getting involved in a long fight and walking away with nothing will ruin your hand for a few turns, and will cost you dearly. Judging when to wimp out is a crucial survival skill. However, since you are also dealing with a table full of other chickens, it offers also an opportunity to feed others the right crumbs, the little bit of grains that they will settle for, yet still leave you taking the sweetest corn [i]without[/i] triggering that costly fight to obtain them[/i]. Very few games will give as many options to mess with your competitors' heads as this one. If you like headology and think that judging other people's motives, and predicting their actions, is a skill, then this is one hell of a master class. If that doesn't appeal to you then I guess this will just be a classy hell.

The most baffling thing, is that this game has stackloads of trackable information, yet somehow it plays quick, doesn't feel heavy, has barely any downtime, and even in a group in which people like to think their moves through, still clocks in at just over and hour in a 5-player game. Maybe it has simply too much trackable info, and people are relying more on gut-instincts.

I usually prefer games that are chockfull of agonizing dilemmas that only use a handful of elements to create them. Tadsch Mahal is certainly on the high end of ingredients, but, with [i]Eschnapur[/i], it is one of the few mechanism-rich bidding games I really like. When you add a lot to the fabric of a building, it only works if all elements add something unique, yet disappear into one coherent structure, that lets you discover something new each time you look closer. It is down to the skill of the architect if it can be pulled off. This is certainly a random-set-up set-collecting Knizia with the type of intricate hand-management that has to be seen from all angles, in glorious 3D. Last night was a great Polaroid, but for once, if you keep snapping, players will keep smiling, no matter how often you take them back for "one more", as if you put 'em in front of a whole new building. Chickens ripe for plucking.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Knizia seems to have a flair for interesting different sets that give you different things, different abilities, different scoring.  Taj Mahal is in some ways like Ra with a different (very different) bidding mechanic, and in many ways not like Ra at all.  I think in Taj Mahal there's more to think about, since your bid cards have the ability to have you win in different areas, all of which feel rather important, though sometimes more so than others.

This game has the ability to anger beyond any I can think of at the moment.  Players are continually forced to compete for valuable resources/positions... always a grump-fest in my group.  I recognize the really excellent design of this game but have recently lowered my rating from an 8 because while it is a very good game, it is not one I really care to play (so, read 6.5 as "Good game, will play sporadically if in the right mood").

Comparing Rialto to Taj Mahal (from a geeklist comment I made):

It (Rialto) definitely ends up feeling quite different while playing but here are some similarities:

1. the obvious- the random setup in which areas are resolved in a different order each game. 

2. you "visit" a new region each round of card play- players vie for control of the region before moving on to the next one. 1+2 are sort of the same, but the spacial element feels similar. In Taj you're planning strategically which areas you are going to attempt to dominate before the game even starts- that's sort of present here as well.

3. Rather than the cards having all assets spread amongs the different suits and bidding for everything all in one big round- Rialto is more compartmentalized. Each "gift" is auctioned off separately with players bidding cards in suits that only win them that particular item. It would be like in Taj if the structure was "first we go around to decide who wins the elephants, then we'll go around for the green lady and so on...

4. (IN Rialto) The spacial considerations involving the networking of your assets is supplanted by a weaker, but still important, one-off goal of being the first person with your men in each of 3 regions. This is the closest analogue to the networking of Taj. 

Rialto is lighter, more focused on card drafting rather than bidding. It's absolutely different- depth, playtime, strat vs tactics- but after playing Rialto I couldn't help but think Taj was an influence- even if only at the most general level.

Win with as little possible.Try to keep at least two to three sets of 3-5 cards of a single color and/or white cards. That way when you go three or four cards in and you still have nothing, you are not out for the next visit. You could at least withdraw and get some matches to use in the next visit.In fact, maybe all withdraws should be decided more on what can be gained from the supply and less on what can be gained from the visit. Something  to try at least.

[b]Getting Started[/b]
After the game is set up, deal 6 cards to each player. Randomly determine the starting player. That player will play first. Start in Province 1. Play is one colored card, or one white card and a colored card each turn, or withdraw. If withdraw, take prizes for having majority of leaders, elephants or grand viziers. Score each good and duplicates (dupes can score multiple times) and/or place palace on good then score each good and duplicates (same as above). After scoring draw two cards from face up supply. Repeat until all players have withdrawn. Last player takes last single card from face up supply. Draw cards to create new supply. Move on to next province. Next clockwise player goes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Only downside is that its a bit heavy, so finding players might be a problem.  Other than that it has multiple paths to victory, enough randomness to keep the game fresh, but not enough to cause chaos, the ability to plan ahead, and just enough conflict/player interaction to make things just a little more interesting.

*Update* I like the new edition over the German Edition only because the colors on the cards and boards are much brighter and easier to see.

This game was on my want to play list for years and I finally got the chance.  Typical Knizia and Alea... it's a good game and I'd play it again.  Probably not a game I'd play over and over again, but the combination of auction tension and multiple scoring options (same goods, connected locations, a few other bonuses) makes it interesting.  In my one play, I was way ahead but got caught since I was completely shutout on the last two turns.  Investing in my game earlier was costly later.

Enjoyable enough, nicely balanced and so on but maybe I am just getting a little over used to Knizia games. Seems reminiscent of Ivanhoe, Beowulf and many others without really ever developing a theme of its own. A bit bland (maybe too strong a word and maybe I am just getting jaded).

Update: So I eventually bought a copy and I am warming to this one a little. It does still have a pasted on theme but the mechanics soon sink in and it is nice to be forced to decide between which battles to fight and which to let go.

Multiple games of chicken going on at once. The cool part is that you can get out if you are going for what others are not, so its not completely a "dollar auction" type of situation. Every once in a while it is though, and you have to know when to get out in that situation.

One play. Bid a lot, lose that bid and get nothing to show for it in the end.  This is a mechanic that should be banned from games, and I will give no free pass to any game that uses it.  Why would any player enjoy losing an auction, getting [u]nothing[/u], and paying for it anyway?  If you think that is fun, give me $20 for nothing and tell me that was fun too.

I don't follow this "brutal = good" formula that seems to be law with geeks here.  I'd need to be convinced to try this again.

Surprisingly quick Alea for as much going on.  Lots of ways to score and scoring is very incremental.  i.e., you are moving up a few points at a time every turn.

Now that I got one under my belt, I want to play again to see if I learned anything.

I'm sorry, but this game just didn't do it for me.  Perhaps it was the chaotic nature of the game, but I fail to see where the deep strategy comes into play.  To me it seemed like we went around the circle laying down cards, with not much bluffing being done.  Maybe my group just went about it the wrong way or maybe it was the letdown after my initial excitement of purchasing the game, but I just didn't get into Taj Mahal :(

I went through a phase, shortly after getting into modern games, where I bought a bunch of titles because they were cheap, not because the game itself was especially appealing. I've stopped doing that now but games like Taj Mahal sit unplayed in my collection as a legacy of that time.

We played this game during our first 2004 visit to the boardgameclub and played it with 4.  It was a nice game.  Good thing was that we got it explained by a senior gameplayer, indeed the game has a lot of rules you might get lost into a bit at first.  You can invite me to play it again !

Good Knizia game, simple but intense. But maybe it'll not be a good idea get a copy because it's a game that desesperatly needs 5 players and my group prefer harder games. If I purchased Taj Mahal, it would become easily the typical "unplayed for years game" because, apart from my group, right now I'm not able to find enough candidates to play this kind of games.

Fun game.  Has a bit of a learning curve that hits you after a few rounds.  I don't know if all of the hype is warranted.  There's a lot of luck in the cards, and the rulebook is correct in saying that frugality (with cards) is key in this game.  Note to self: The real points are in the commodities... so stop thinking that you get oodles of points by making enormous chains of palaces :P

RATING: 8
A Knizia classic set in India.  It has a sort of press-your-luck feel with mechanics some have described as being close to poker, sort of.  A few paths to victory, a tactical thinking game with out being too deep.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is quite a deep strategic game, looks simple on the surface, but there is a number of considerations to watch out for. Running out of cards is bad. Scoring for a run of cards at the end also discourages playing too many cards. Dropping out early from some rounds can give you more cards, but if you do this too much, then you won't necessarily get bonuses for claiming the majority of monks or moguls or whatever. Cunning!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Really cool bidding game, but early elephant wins seems to be absolutely essential... that seems to give extra weight to (A) the players that were dealt an amazing starting hand and (B) the randomly chosen start player in the first round (who will PASS immediately to draw 3 cards including the 2 best to fit his starting hand.)  I wish the network scoring was heavier weighted...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The poker-like 'bidding' is interesting at first (macho posturing, etc) until things go a bit far and you get completely hosed. At that point you realise that you have to play nice to have a chance (and that's not quite so much fun).

RATING: 9
Ooh, the dimensions working both for and against you in this one!  I can understand why this is so highly regarded: beautiful presentation, demanding choices, and a delicious press-your-luck element as to when you should fold to nab your coveted prizes (or when to cut bait and try to pull out at least *something* for your cards.)  This really stands out as a worthwhile title to play and re-play; it should reward subsequent visits with its depth.  Most recently played on 11 Nov. '06 with Donovan, Pam and Michael.

A pretty abstract game with an Indian theme, simple mechanics but quite deep gameplay. Except for each players' starting hand, all information is open. An experienced gamer could plot a plan to victory were it not for the bidding mechanics. 

The game is set collection and route connection through the auctioning of six different resources. One resource gives sets of goods, one resource gives a connection point and four other resources are used for both. Most cards in hand contain a combination of two resources to bid on and in turn someone plays a card or passes. Upon passing majority is checked, where ties deliver nothing. Add to this a few special cards to spice up strategic choices, and that's about the whole game.

I love how the little metallic Taj Mahal pieces interlock when stacking. It's nice having something to do during an AP fase of an opponent.

Not my favourite game - can be a problem if 2 players go all out for a particular region, end result 2 players have few cards for following rounds, and one player (the loser) is out for the count. Makes a big problem for 3 players.

Easy to learn.  Tricky as far as developing definative control.  It feels like a gambling game in some senses and a bidding game in some ways.  Real power comes from some serious card counting and special attention made to how hard opposing players can/will set against onesself for various special cards with special point gaining/crad swapping abilities.


Very solid game ratings wise.

The rules are simple, but it's challenging to play.  I had enough trouble trying to figure out what I should do and how do I go about doing it, to pay attention to the other players.  And you NEED to pay attention to the other players.  You need to block them, and keep them from bailing out first and taking some winnings with them.

Maybe I'll get it on the fifth play.  For now, it's challenging and a little frustrating.

One of the highlight of 2013 for me.  It's a push-your-luck area control hand management card game with multiple paths to victory.  It's also teachable in 5ish minutes.  I suspect 4 is the ideal player count; however, while a bit looser, 3 player is great to teach and fun to play.

Un juego de subastas algo sesudo. Cada jugador puede seguir pujando o pasar. Cuando pasa recibe su premio, que puede ser el control de un estamento social (lo que te permite poner un palacio en el tablero), el gran mogul (parecido) o conseguir el dominio económico de la provincia. Después de que todos han pasado, la visita a la provincia finaliza. El juego dura 12 provincias. Está interesante, aunque es dificil de planear estrategias. Tiene algo de factor suerte. A mí es un juego que me ha gustado bastante.

Adquirido en labsk a Stoicakovic en las navidades de 2009.

after one play: i didn't like being limited to the 5 cards in my hand.  it made the game seem to play itself.  also, the value of the elephants seems way out of balance compared to the other ways to gain points, even though you bid for all of them in the same way.  if you don't get the elephant cards, you can't win the elephant, and you'll lose miserably.

A little more luck-dependent than I would like a good strategy game to be. It contains 2 elements that I personally don't care for: card drafting and playing chicken. The combination is a double whammy when they are so central to the essence of this game.

1/18/05 - 2 plays. Commerce tiles are always placed at random except for the No. 12 (it is always placed in the province containing Agra) so the board setup is never the same twice. Cards are the driving force to gain influence and potentially earns you the right to place a palace in a province which may or may not lead you to score extra points for picking up goods or extra points chit and/or connecting provinces (1 point for every province which become connected to the current placement of a palace). This all translates into a few different means of achieving points and the victory. Based on the geeks rating system...this is a '10'...cannot forsee tiring of this game.

I wasn't terribly impressed with Tadsch Mahal. It's not a bad game, and there is plenty going on -- pushing your luck with card play, hand management, connecting strings of provinces with palaces, collecting commodities, getting bonuses on certain spaces and with the princess, etc. But I just wasn't drawn into the game as I wanted to be. The card designs and colors are also less than satisfying. There are several people in the group I play with who have color vision problems, and for them, Taj Mahal is a nightmare. The publishers should have, at minimum, used a different background design for the cards.

Wonderful.  I was concerned by early reviews which made me wonder if I would like it but the heart of the game - the multi-suited cards with mutiple open tricks - works superbly well, with all the other parts interconnecting well.  

It's easy to joke about Knizia producing the same game multiple times and I've done it myself but this, Durch and Traumfabrik (to pick only a few of my favourites) testify to the breadth as well as the height of his talents as a designer.

By the time this game out, top-flight big-box games from Herr Knizia had become such a common thing that Taj Mahal was greeted with less enthusiasm than I thought it merited.

This one left me feeling underwhelmed. It has confrontation but it feels passive aggressive as it's a bit of a race, and what you can contend over is somewhat determined by the cards you acquire. The push your luck/chicken feel is nice, but coming in second can seriously hose you and at times there's nothing you can do about it.

It also feels like there's a lot of accounting going on. You're always adding up symbols, adjusting your ledger with a new card, trying to squeak out a collection of abstract icons greater than your foe.

The sum of the experience is not one that's particularly fun.

Knizia is by far my favorite designer and I think this is his very best. 

The possibility of spending resources and gaining nothing creates more tension than any game I have ever played. Beyond that though, the hand management choices are subtle and brilliant. The fact that you need two chits to steal a special card, and how to time that, that long suit is worth end-game points, in addition to wanting to win goods and bonus chits and extend connections make the decisions multi-layered and difficult. You need a long-term plan, but there is no way you won't be changing that plan multiple times throughout the game. It is a perfect melding of strategy and tactics, wrapped in a series of vicious auctions. 

Taj Mahal is not a game that holds your hand. I have seen players blunder their way to dreadful showings, so it does require players who pay attention and are competent card players - so it is squarely a gamers game. Also I have become a convert to only wanting to play with 4. So the game is fragile. But under the right circumstances, this is my absolute favorite gaming experience.

Clever card / board game with lots of interesting mechanics and ways to score. Rather abstract but I liked the poker-like card play which balances the choice of folding early and taking the best cards to improve your future hands with the hope that you'll win the elephant and a number of the characters each with their special ability to gain points and special cards now. Probably not the sort of game to play with analytical types as this would slow it down and make it no fun at all. A solution to this might be to hand out VP chips which could be kept secret rather than using the scoring track. In all of my games to date there has been a runaway leader problem with no way of catching up.

RATING: 10
After about 10 plays, my gut tells me that this is Knizia's masterpiece.  The choices before you are so simple -- play, or withdraw -- but the considerations are vastly complex.  If you play, you've got to be sure you'll win, because usually you can't afford to part with valuable cards for nothing.  You need to manage and to carefully build your hand.  You need to plan ahead based on which regions you're bidding first, which ones you're last, and where the different resources are.  You've got to pay some attention to the hands your opponents are building.  You have to choose between the board spots with the bonus chips, and the ones that most help you to build chains. You have to know the advantages/disadvantages of going first/last.  And despite all the planning, no two games are the same.  It's a game in which you can't afford to gamble, and lose.  Elegant and unforgiving, like putting at Augusta when the greens are fast.  Everyone's in the same boat, but only one of you can manage things the best.

Rated 9 after one play. Wow... I was surprised how much I liked this game. I read the rules, played a few "dummy" rounds to learn the game, but the actual first play really grabbed me.

I've never shied away from direct player interaction, and this game has it in spades. The unique auction of committing cards and losing them whether you win an aspect of the auction or not generates a grand game of chicken. It's fun to push people around and try to muscle them with better cards. I can see the connection to poker. It's a card-driven game with a board for adding various means for scoring.

Who knows if my rating stays this high, but any game that offers this degree of interaction and angst in choices is normally going to sit very well with me.

Update after 2nd play with five players: I'm still loving this game, though a five player game is pretty rough. This game hits all my sweet spots--auction, direct interaction, tough choices and that sensation of wanting to do three things but having only the means to do two. Other players are a bit more lukewarm to this game than myself, but I'll continue to champion it for now.

Another update: I love this game, but I don't find other people really enjoying it as much as I do. It's a rough game for new players. Still, I love the auction mechanic and I'm willing to hold onto this for now to see if the game finds an audience.

Update: Well, traded this one away. I still like the game, but no one else in my local gaming group is clamoring to play this one. I'd gladly play again but I don't need to own this game without any audience for it.

A stark contrast to Amun Re for me in my exploration of older euro mid-weight auction games. I like this one. The mixed-currency, all-pay auctions and the benefits they bestow are much more interesting than the pursuit of the secret goals of Amun Re. The long-suit scoring, the need to win the same token twice to take the card, the connectivity issues and the order in which the regions are played all contribute to a long-term planning horizon that makes the game work. I'd very much enjoy playing more but it is not a burning desire.

Maybe I need a few more plays, or maybe I need to play against other people with less rigid strategies, but it seems that unless you have a strategy in place and are strongly implementing it by turn 4 or so, you don't have much hope to win.  There doesn't appear to be many chances for you to change and adapt your strategy, due to either not having the right cards to use (such as princess cards) or the right framework in place to build from (previously won elephants or palaces).  At that point, you can still bring other people down by forcing them into long auctions over items they really want, even though you don't have much chance yourself.

I tried, oh, how i tried to make this game work with myself and my friends.  Just couldn't do it, despite loving Knizia's other games.

Update:
After ~10 years, I gave this game another shot and it was much better than I remembered it.  I would like to play it a couple more times but it seems like a fine design.

The auctions for this game can be insane as you bid hoping to get a certain tile, not knowing what kind of currency your opponents have (who the HECK has 8 yellow monks in their hand, I know that I can win this!) only to see someone match your bid forcing you to withdraw with almost nothing. I also like the fact the ties go in favor of the person who caused the tie as it makes for a tougher choice when raising the bid as you hope that everything that you are tied with choices to withdraw or has no more of that item in hand.

This is a very well designed multiple currency auction cum spatial game, by the master of auctions. Some people consider it a classic. For me it lacks the elegance and profoundness of Ra and Modern Art, and thus I consider it inferior to them. Still, it is an excellent, tense game that shines with four good players. Bluff your way to success all you want!

RATING: 5
Would not want to play again with 5 players. Might be willing to try with less. Some of the production values on the game were over the top good and some were equally bad. The palace pieces are amazing. The card design was considered, but doubling symbols the way they did is ridiculously confusing for teaching. Board colors are pretty to look at, but don't read well for game purposes. Overall bidding mechanism is interesting, but leaves for many turns where you basically don't do anything which I pretty much hated.

RATING: 7
The sheer number of decisions and things to keep track of are impressive; and I like the core card playing aspect which encourages nasty games of chicken, the outcome (or avoidance) of which often determine the final winner. This game has 3 major paths to victory, and is fascinating in that one is best off choosing a strategic path from the start of the game, but some wiggle room is definitely necessary, and knowing when to pick your fights (and when to bow out) is critically important.

However, the game only plays at it's best (IMHO) with 4 players (3 allows auctions to go too cheaply, makes folding without playing a card to get that 3rd card to rebuild your hand almost unthinkable because of the smaller number of players, and makes linking too easy, while 5 makes linking nigh impossible, and thus makes the game overly elephant and princess card based). A solid game, but the best at 4 scale make it a very occasional play for me. I used to own this, but ultimately had to let it go because of this requirement. If I was rating this purely on the 4 scale it would pretty easily roll in at 8, but I think both 3 and 5 are lacklustre, and mean that I generally avoid playing this game, so I have to knock it down to 7 overall.

The group I play with loves this game and that may have infuenced my rating. Still, in my opinion this is a great game. There are several paths to victory and they change in importance depending on how many players there are. There are a few obvious but many subtle strategies. I&#039;ve played a number of times and am still learning. The game involves card management, some bluffing and fun threats and intimidation. You need to plan ahead strategically while having sound tactics on each turn.

First play was 3p and I wasn't so sure. It seemed to suffer a bit from a runnaway leader as two got into a battle leaving the third to clean up. After a recent 5p game it seems this can still be the case if the table doesn't know the game. There are two main ways of gaining points and to work well all players need to be wary of letting any one player have the monopoly. Actually this has improved my view of the game but I'm not sure how much I want to play it. Perhaps a few games with people who know the game would help, but that's not always possible.

One play - finally got in my first play of Taj.  It's one of the most popular games with one of my groups yet I never seemed to be at the table when it came out ... It's nice.  There's a lot going on, which is good .. but the one game I experienced (3 player) saw a significant runaway leader and a significant last place finisher ... so much to the point where it seemed like the last three or four rounds were played out just as a formality.  Will try it again.

Taj Mahal is basically 'Chicken' cast into a modern jacket. By playing cards with symbols on them you claim several objects to be won in an artifical-looking province in India, but you can only [i]get[/i] them if you still have the majority in those symbols once your turn comes again. By actually claiming or simply withdrawing you remove your cards from the table, which may cause someone else to obtain a majority automagically. This part of the game is rather unique; if I have seen it used elsewhere I cannot remember it, and at this stage I've seen a not-insignificant amount.

I like the tension this 'bidding' creates; there's both turn angst and player order chaos to consider. What I'm not sure about is how this mechanism is embedded in the rest of the game. The cards are exceedingly important to what you can do, and although you can decide to hoard cards and [i]then[/i] strike in whatever form, there doesn't seem to be a lot of variability in how you approach the strategy and tactics of this game. Other strategies are easy to spot and can also be blocked effectively: this doesn't mean that it always happens, but [i]if[/i] it happens the player following that strategy won't be happy. Add to this that some of the palaces you place get placed there through 'collateral bonuses', meaning you did not intend to win one, but actually won one without fighting for it. Loss of cards without winning anything for it [i]really[/i] bites individually, so most players are inclined to just give a palace to another player. This is probably some point balancing mechanism, but the haphazard and accidental way it functions is weird.

All in all there are some good things about Taj Mahal. In the past I really liked this game. But when it comes to the table nowadays I see a somewhat artifical game with too many rough little patches and spots to make it hold my attention for more than the single event. The fact that I never bring this to the table, preferring other titles instead, is an additional nail in the coffin. I've downgraded my rating as a consequence: the game simply lost a bit of its shine over time.

Recomiendo al jugar llevar las cuentas cómo en la versión online del juego, es decir, cuando un jugador acabe su turno, hace el recuento temporal de objetos que podría conseguir (los pone sobre sus cartas) de tal manera que cuando un jugador comienza su turno sabe exactamente lo que consigue o deja de conseguir si pasa el turno. Creo no que se pierde mucho tiempo haciéndolo y lo hace más vistoso y comprensible.[/COLOR]

My 2nd auction-based game after Monopoly. 

Though there's enough rules running in tandem to ensure multiple viable strategies, they were simple enough to be explained in a few minutes.

I felt I fully understood the game after a few rounds and given the absence of anything analogous to Puerto Rico's buildings, I'd soon seen everything being used and felt fully in control - it was now down to me to weigh up the options.

Once strategies are decided, the game moves fairly quickly and - for a change - I wasn't holding the group up.

Though my strategy won on this occasion, I can foresee the need to adapt to others' play.

Though the cards ostensibly add randomness, looking at those available and evaluating the need to back out early to select better cards becomes a greatly strategic element.

Really fun! No real way to gang up on the leader too much and not a whole lot of luck which I like. I turned this into a much more psychological bluffing style game. Lots of planning with card pickups and waiting for the right time to strike, laying all your cards down to pick up that great resource tile or the perfect position for your palace. I really couldn't have had a better time playing this game. My only complaint is that the cards are stupidly designed. They duplicate the same image on the left and right but you should be able to glance at someone's tableau and see how many of each resource they have. The duplicated images can sometimes throw you off making you think they have one more of something that they don't. Otherwise, no flaws I can think of.

Y otro Knizia que se suma a la lista de los que me gustan :P

El juego mola mucho, y es mas o menos fluido, incluso jugando 5 jugadores (todos novatos)

Me han gustado los componentes, aunque he echado de menos que los palacios no sean mas apilables (he pasado un buen rato apilandolos xD

Como en tantos juegos, es importante conseguir losetas octogonales pronto, para puntuar por varias cosas desde el principio, y conectar los palacios entre regiones es VITAL. Salvo que las cartas que puedas ganar retirandote sin ganar ningun palo sean muy interesantes para una jugada planificada posterior, jamas se debe abandonar una region sin colocar castillo, a no ser que se sacrifiquen demasiadas cartas, en cuyo caso a no ser que sean las ultimas rondas se deberia saber cuando retirarse

A magnificent and brutal design.  Multiplayer Blue Moon, Taj is a heavyweight with constant confrontation.  Decisions are agonizing as during the visits there is the desire to push on but incentive to retire.  There is also the strong psychological pressure to tilt in which you overcommit after taking a loss.  Amazing balance between long term strategy and tactical execution.  A very intense but extremely satisfying game.

I'll See Your Two Elephants and Raise You a Crown.
There are still a few Reiner games I have not tried yet, but so far I feel this is far and away his best. I almost feel this way after each of his new games but this one is still going strong after a full year of playing. It is one of the few games I do not get tired of after repeated playings.
I tried it two nights ago with 5 players for the first time. While I thought it was slightly broken with that many players, it was still a lot of fun. I found two problems with 5 players: One is that the Elephants are about the only way to win. The second problem that I found was the white card that gives 2 victory points when played was also too powerful. This is a four player game. Every turn is gutwrenching unless you've decided just to bow out and go for cards. The games do not last too long and each round everyone is watching what's going on so there is no real down time. It is a lot like poker except what you are losing instead of chips are the cards you are putting down and these are very valuable and hard to come by.
I have seen on the web that some think that it is too confusing and there are too many ways to score, but I play with an 11 year old girl and her mom and they have absolutely no problem with the game. I get the feeling that these people have just read the rules and decided it was too difficult. Once you start playing it all falls into place.

An excellent game. It can seem fairly complicated at a first glance, but after only a couple of plays suddenly everything clicks and from then on it is a very intuitive game, but by no means a simplistic one.  This is of course a hallmark of a great design, and this definitely is one.  It offers countless little decisions on when to cut your losses and drop out and when to fight on, which provides a constant tension to the game, where all decisions seem to matter very highly. See also Ivanhoe, which is in essence a stripped down, card only version of Taj Mahal.

Only played once.  I could see the rating going up with more plays.  Some good depth here and interesting decisions.  Some of the auctions feels like a game of chicken which can be nerve-wracking.  Do I stay in and commit more cards and hope that the others bow out so I can gain a windfall of resources, or should I cut my loses now and bow out.  Just wish there was a bit more theme.  Looking forward to my next playing.

RATING: 10
Players are Indian nobility on a tour through 12 provinces.  That aside, this is a wonderful game of bidding and bluff for six "prizes" available in each province.  The prizes are claimed by having a majority in those prizes at the point your withdraw from the round - a stroke of genius that you have to experience to realize how clever it is.  Points are earned based on prizes won, via set collecting, forming chains of palaces on the board, or through bonuses via other means.  Tense and exciting, with every round a game of chicken waiting for someone to blink, yet if you pay attention there is surprisingly little luck.  One of the "must have" German games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
I consider Taj Mahal Knizia's magnum opus and prize it as the apex of great design.

In every one of the twelve round, there is an obvious incentive to play: to gain points and win!. But at times you must sit out an entire round in order to replenish resources. The very decisions of when to fight at all is often a big one in Taj Mahal.

Once rounds begin, there is a devilish system of bidding in different currencies to win the palaces. The conditions of the auction are cruel. No one is declared a winner of a palace until none of the other players are even tying their bid. So it is very difficult to win multiple palaces. Also others may tie your bids in order to exhaust your resources. A very confrontational game at heart! Wondering whether you can outlast your opponents in Taj Mahal is more tense than poker.

When you do use your turn to quit, you only get teh palaces you are undisputed leader in. And you immediately place palaces, and then another sub-game heppens. Becasue there are bonus points given for making chains! Finally, you immediately replenish your cards by drafting from the pool drawn before the round started. 

Because of the placement and drafting, you sometimes have an incentive to bid for only palace and then quickly quit. Especially to pick the best location and draft the best cards before they are gone! 

Learning to balance all of these countervailing costs and rewards is always a challange, even to veterans. Never does one always get what they want. Taj Mahal it is a constant game of comprimise, adaptation, and pushing-your-luck. 

You have to using rely on very little infomation about your opponents' resources and goals, and often play from the gut. It is a very rewarding and fun game, though grasping the goals can be difficult at first. 
 
If you can muddle through your introductary game you will discover that this is the enduring gem of Eurogames! I give my highest recommendation.

It is a very good game. I like the fact that you have things to consider, plan, and more importantly concentrate on the entire game. The downtime is filled with planning and strategy. I'm not sure how much of a "fun" factor this game had for me, but it was a very close, very competitive experience.

Of the Euro-Games, I think this one is the most fun, but I don't rate it higher than E&T or PR because its hard to develop any cohesive strategy - other players can ruin your plans without even knowing it.  Not saying there is no skill, just that its hard to really plan ahead.  Still a good game.

Lot of stuff going on here, even or a heavy Knizia.  Played once, and I'd like to try it again.  My game was with 5 players, and I wonder if it would be better with 4 - making connections seemed to be underpowered vs. goods.

UPDATE March 2014
After a couple years of playing "modern" Euros, returning to Taj Mahal helps me appreciate it for the masterpiece it is.  This game takes you on a roller coaster where you feel alternatively powerful and near helpless, and riding out those waves is the key to success.  The design is razor sharp, but also allows for creativity and brutal player interaction.  Unlike a lot of the current crop of Eurogames, there is no rubber banding here.  Players will likely not all finish within a few points of each other.  If you mess up, you overextend, you miscalculate, you will be punished for it, and I miss that in my Eurogames!  This should all rights be in the top 50.

This game completely breaks down if players don't all play it "the right way."

It's very easy for one player to get on track for a runaway victory. In theory, it's not all that hard for an opponent to put up a roadblock against such a victory, but in practice, you have to sacrifice your own progress completely -- making no progress to help yourself -- just to thwart the leader. So what results is a giant game of "chicken" where no one wants to be one to flinch and "take one for the team" to stop the leader. If no one stops the leader, he will win, but whoever DOES throw in to stop the leader guarantees that he himself won't win -- he'll just open the possibility for the second place player to sneak in and steal the victory.

Hard to believe Reiner Knizia's responsible for this.

Great bluffing and auctioning type game.  Only negative is I think you should score every palace built in a region instead of only being able to score one point.  Sweet spot seems to be 4 players as 5 was a bit too chaotic.

RATING: 9
Really solid Knizia title (back when he was innovative and interesting, which doesn't seem to be the case anymore).  The card play is quite tense and you have to plan ahead for future provinces.  You have to gauge when to drop out and when to play a large group of cards, because getting little or nothing for a large card expenditure is going to hurt. Commodity scoring and palace scoring are the key methods for earning points, but palace chains require winning buildings in key locations to make it work.  I like the pace of the game, the depth of thinking about the cards, and the future planning involved.   Very engaging game, and it is competitive and intense - I like that.

The bluffing/bidding mechanic is just plain fun, where you often dont know whether to pull out of a hand or to try to outlast everyone; nice tension and lots of available decisions to be made.  A few problems in the game, though: tile-pictures seem to score too much by their exponential growth, and so the luck factor can influence the game a bit too much, or leads to single-minded strategies (get elephants); and the game is unforgiving if in early rounds you bid too many cards and fall behind.  In too many games, 1 or 2 players pull out way ahead early (and stay there), making it dull and discouraging for trailing players, who have a hard time catching up.  Probably needs very experienced players who can guess opponents' likely moves to have a close game.

Knizia. Nekem ez a játék a szimpatikusabbjai közül való, már elsőre tetszett - még annak ellenére is, h a megszerzett 14 pontommal nagyjából 30 ponttal lemaradva voltam utolsó, gyakorlatilag a játék során egyszer sem volt esélyem semmire. DE egyrészt nagyon szép a kivitelezés, másrészt jó az ötlet, és a játék menet is. China szerű -lusta vagyok utána nézni melyik volt előbb, amúgy is érdektelen-, de ez eggyel mélyebb játék talán. Tetszik, h ugyan fix a befejezés, de a 12 tartomány mindig máshol, máshogy fekszik - ezzel elérve mindig változatos legyen, a taktikát módosítani kell az adott táblához. És persze a licitálás-megszerzés menete is szimpatikus. Szóval összességében tetszik a játék, és most többed játék után fel is emeltem az értékét 1-el.

Taj Mahal is a good game, but I feel that playing it for the first time 14 years after its release has made it a little less stunning to me than it might have a long time ago.  Even still, I was surprised to see that I was able to catch up at least to a battle for 3rd despite my terrible play of the opening two turns.

What I enjoyed most was the gambling aspect, which probably says more about me than the actual game.  Like poker, it's simply a matter of raising the bet each time you go around the table, but there's no option to call.  Coupled with the option to withdraw from the bidding at your leisure, which provides benefits if timed correctly, there's a really neat metagame layered on top of Taj Mahal as you guess and second-guess your opponents.

I'd like to see that applied to a different sort of game, but within Taj Mahal, it works just fine.

I recently replayed Taj Mahal. I enjoyed Taj Mahal a whole lot more the second time around. My first experience of Taj Mahal was not good at all. The game mechanic is a bit particalur.

I had a better understanding of the game rules and know what I was doing and why a whole lot more in my second game played. I almost won that game too. One point behind first player! The other games played wasn't that close. It needs to be played more often to have a better understanding of the game.

I played Taj Mahal again and it was quite enjoyable experience. Taj Mahal really is better with more plays. Taj Mahal is worth looking into, although I've been told it's either a love it or hate it type of game.

I can really see why people say: if you like poker you should try Taj Mahal. Knowing when to fold from a visitation or to potentially bluff and proceed is an important aspect of the game. The card play and hand management is really the heart of the game but you have a bit of a spatial board element as well as a set collection for points to contend with. There are also special cards for the players to compete for. These are not only strong because they allow you add a bonus to a played card but they come back to you every round until another player steals the card from you. Being that I've only played it once, I'm not really sure how much I like it.

The one thing I don't like about this game, and unfortuneately a deal breaker for me, is the all or nothing showdowns with the cards.  Having to lose your entire bid when you get outbid, and often on every single itemm, is just too painful and frustrating for me.  For some people it makes the game intense, I'm sure, but for me it makes me angry, and I don't want to be angry while playing a game.  I've only played it a couple of times, but I'm starting out with a 6.  I'll give it another try, but I'm not very optimistic of the rating going up any.

Edit:  Tried it again.  Still feel the same way.  Can't see myself playing this much any more.

Best design I've ever seen. You are trying to get points spatially, by set collection, by collecting bonuses, and by possession of the +2 card. A little bit of press-your-luck, a little bit of bluffing, and some hand management. You don't refill your hand by drawing cards blindly from a deck; you get to draw 2 cards (usually) from a set of face-up cards...but only at the point where you decide to stop competing for the round. Withdraw early and you get your choice. Withdraw late and you get what's left. Awesome awesome game, and about as medium in weight as Euros go.

Each of Taj Mahal's individual mechanics is well implemented (and remniscent of those of many of Knizia's other titles) and the game, on paper, appears compelling and well balanced. However, in actual gameplay I found that the game to be less than the sum of its parts. Certainly the actions (or inaction) of other players and randomness had some bearing on the end result, but I was unpleasantly surprised that my off-balance "strategy" of ignoring goods and going exclusively after building chains of influence markers (often with Mogul) and holding the Princess card largely to the exclusion of the other tokens and goods gave me the win (and by the margin that it did). Perhaps I simply knew when to withdraw and my opponents did not, but I find that scenario unlikely. [Please note that these comments come after only a single play. I'd gladly give it another go.]

Played twice now.  Love it, in fact we all enjoyed it (both 4er with my wife and 2 different couples).  Was easy to learn & teach, easy to pick up strategy, and moved along fast.  I can see this one taking less than 90 minutes, yet it's packed with strategic decisions.  It can be frustrating if you get caught in a card battle, and it's tough to cut your losses, but all in all the game is terribly rewarding.  Meaty & satisfying, although somewhat dry in theme.

As with most Knizia games (especially from his golden run of games in the nineties and ought years), the game play seems very simple (withdraw or play cards), but, once you get a few plays in, you also realize that you are balancing network building, resource gathering, hand management, and auctions.  You also get better at pinpointing which auctions to really go for.  The players also play a big part in this one; need people that really get into the auctions and card play.

* Played 20+ times. Abstract but intense multiplayer strategy game. One of very few Knizia games I enjoy playing. Each province is an all out game of chicken with big stakes. Tense, replayable, nice color scheme.

JUN/13 Got a 5er in with new players. After years between playings, I still found this game to be tense and full of gut-wrenching decisions, but over the years I've fallen out of love with pure Euros, and this Knizia design, though admirable, just isn't fun enough for me anymore. Listed.

[Hand Management, Set Collection, Network Connection, Political, India] {3P:7, 4P:9, 5P:8} Reinier Knizia takes his stomping grounds, the bidding genre, one step further with Taj Mahal. Cards are the main resource of the game, and you need to parley your cards into more resources, or directly into the Influence Points you need to win. As usual, multiple paths to victory and deep strategy combine with tense bidding tactics to produce a superior game. *** UPDATE: Still a nine, a fantastically frustrating but ultimately rewarding game which I always lose by a LOT but keep returning to because I can't figure it out. This may eventually challenge the realm of 10 despite my record of futility, because it's so uniquely maddening. Amazing, amazing game. *** UPDATE: What more can I say? Taj Mahal, welcome to the Pantheon of Godly Games. *** UPDATE: What is it about not being able to win that generates so much obsession? Well, I've won Taj now. Several times. And I've got a handle on it. It's tenuous, but with understanding comes clarity and closure. This remains an outstanding, Holy game, but it's not the Holy of Holies. I return Taj to demigod status, and there she will stay.

RATING: 9
Another fantastic auction game from Knizia. Taj Mahal is incredibly tight. The twist that you can't spend all of your available cards in one auction due to the colour restrictions leads to agonizing decisions every turn. If you miss the right opportunity to get out of an auctioning round things will get ugly, expensive, and you'll possibly have to leave with no gain at all. At the same time it's quite possible to win influence with mediocre hands. It all comes down to a question of timing and a little bluffing.

During our first game we thought the game might have a run-away leader issue, with one player having a 15 point lead at one point. By the end of the game, the top three players were within 3 points of each other, though, so it seems to be that some strategies simply pay off earlier than others. Outstanding!

One of Knizia's best designs, it is said, but I don't really like it. I find it irritating that you bid with cards, but you always have to pay your bid even if you get overbid. That means you can pay a lot and receive very little. I know, that's all in the game's tactics, and you can see what bidding cards other people take, but that means that if you have a strong memory, you are clearly ahead of others. I personally don't like games very much where open information is made secret in order to confuse you.

Taj Mahal is a classic Knizia game. A bit dry and abstract but a really beefy scoring system with multiple paths- something that I really enjoy. Plus I like the wallpaper AKA theme of the game. People say that all new players fumble through their first game of TM, and so we did. Super solid gameplay and I like that the game as a determined ending point.  Perhaps this game has been surpassed in the 14 years since its release, but it still feels fresh and like a classic Euro.  A great 4-player game but works fine with 3 as well.

One of my favorite medium-weight auction/area control games. I like the interplay between hand management, how influence points are calculated, and different ways to score. More depth meets the eye, though some will decry the abstractness and pasted theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is a rating likely to rise in time.  Taj Mahal is a unique game unlike any other I have played.  It's area control, but actually more commodity control.  Foresight is key in this one.  Knowing when to choose your battles (bids) is essential.

UPDATE:  I have been able to find time for this Knizia title recently and it has consequently jumped up a point and a half in my ratings.  I enjoy the poker element to this game as well as the tough decisions to be made between short term and long term goals.  The marriage of strategic and tactical play is seamless. I expect this might even rise further in the future.

UPDATE:  The risk management in this game balanced with an ever developing ebb and flow between tactics and strategy is amazing.  Each round offers new tension, new values for goods, and just mind melting goodness.  Essentially a bluff and bid game, Taj Mahal feels like so much more.  Managing your hand is essential, and the somewhat unintuitive nature of the game can sometimes create situations, in the heat of play, where emotions become more convincing than your wits  - and you can end up self destructing by not backing out of a lost cause.  Few games work on the level Taj does for me.  Taj successfully bores into the cranium and births dormant competitiveness on a more primal level.  I rarely win, but that's because greed and foolish play have blinded me too often.  This game is brilliant!

Now! I know what this game is all about. It's about tension, risk taking and something that is over the fluffy theme.
This isn't a ,,real" board game. This is a CARD game with board. And what's happening on the board is VERY important though.

A game trying to be too clever for it's own good that ends up sacrificing play-ability, in the end. Too many score mechanics for an auction/poker styled route-laying game, that creates more yawns than many games out there today. The poker end, although fun for a round or two, really doesn't amount to much- not enough card play to make it really interesting. The mapboard is somewhat bland & could be far better designed. I was overjoyed to say goodbye to this one.

A unique blend of mechanics.  Great press-your-luck card play that interacts very strongly with the need for good board positioning.  Also, the palace bits are way cool.

Unfortunately I've become convinced that "shrewd" play does not correlate very well with high scores.  Each player will have certain rounds in which it is extremely advantageous to earn specific rewards, because that player's palace chain could be extended or some key commodities could be obtained.  However, it is often not within the player's power to ensure a good outcome on these key hands--the remaining players' actions are too unpredictable to ensure success.  As a result, I believe that outcomes are mostly random; this has caused my rating to decrease.

[b] Taj Mahal[/b] [i] Reiner Knizia 2006[/i]
Taj Mahal is a very solid game, easy to understand (way easier to score than most of Knizias games as well) and good for three, four or five players. Although its theme is a little bit pasted and dry it works well. The game is also short, 90/100 minutes for five experienced players. Comparing this gaming time with its difficulty and the strategic options that the game offers, the result is one of the best ratios available in the gaming industry among the short-medum difficult games, Some kingmaking can exist since a novice player can retreat his cards too soon or stay playing cards in a stuborn way when he must give up. The game is perfect for four players, but very playable with three or five.

I enjoy Taj Mahal immensely, although the lack of control can be be frustrating at times. The game's best feature is that it supports a wide variety of paths to victory, both in terms of strategy and tactics.  Playing Taj Mahal is a very tense experience, with the feeling that you're walking a tightrope and could tumble with the slightest breeze.  I've raised my rating from 8 to 9 because it gets better and better the more you play it, which is to me the sign of a great game.

Unfortunately though, and unusually for a Knizia game, Taj Mahal is only at its best with exactly four players.  With three, there are simply too many items up for auction and not enough competition for those items.  With five, the game feels very random and/or arbitrary because there are too many players to act between your card plays.  You can't realistically predict what's going to happen in the auction, and so you spend more time hoping and less time planning.

Taj Mahal has often been compared to Poker, probably because like Poker, the key decision you're making again and again is whether to back down or to gamble more resources on the fight.  Both sometimes involve bluffing, and both nearly always require you to assess your opponent's strength and temperament.  But I don't care for Poker and I love Taj Mahal so the correlation is probably pretty weak.  Poker is a battle of psychology and probability stripped bare of almost all other game elements.  Taj Mahal has multiple goals, multiple paths to those goals, and multiple choices within those paths.  Each Taj Mahal "hand" is tightly woven into the previous hands and the following hands, while Poker hands are more like a series of unrelated events strung together.

Twenty-three plays. Win or lose, it's a blast, every time. Scores big in the game-as-a-depiction-of-life department, since you can look ahead and prepare for the future, yet you still must struggle at the decisive moment, and even then you can't really know how things are going to shake out...and that's not due to dumb luck or the turn of a card but rather odd chains of events that are fascinating to watch unfold, even if you wind up with the short end of the stick. Some have described it as a bluffing game, but I think it's more about discretion; the ability to convince others to drop out of fights is useful but knowing when to drop out yourself is a much more valuable skill.

Played 10+ with 4 or 5 players. I like it best with 4 players. It is a wonderful balanced game that I feel very comfortable with. You can suffer badly if involved in a big card play battle or if the province you choose to back out of is won with few cards played by the other players. If you are really serious about playing this game well you need to mentally note what cards others draw. Taj Mahal would be my tournament game of choice though I would expect my brain to be fried by the end. Nov 03

*UPDATE* 20th play. The game has aged well. I still only recommend it with exactly 4 players. It is possible to feel out of it early on and there is no real way to pull back the leader but the game is comfortably over in 90 minutes and the poker style card play is exciting throughout the game even if you are out of contention for the win.

Excellent game! Love the unique mechanism of passing and seeing who's exerting power over what individuals and who's going to be controlling products. Very tight management of cards as well makes for hard decisions in every round.

The interaction between players is great. You constantly have to watch for your and your opponent's actions. Any mistake might be costly, as it's very hard to come back once you get left behind. Very, very good game!!

RATING: 4
How well you do in Taj Mahal depends far more on what your opponents allow you to do, than what you choose to do yourself.

Careful, considered play allows you to position yourself to win conflicts. However, it's not only important to win, but to win quickly* and you have very little control over this.

(*Five conflicts occur simultaneously. As each is resolved, spoils and compensation are awarded from a common pool. "Win" a conflict late in the round and the pool may be so depleted that it would have been better to have lost earlier.)

This is an interesting Knizia game that plays a bit like poker, in that it requires bluffing as well as patience to know when to stay in the hand or when to fold. If everyone pays attention, the scores can be very close, and it is exciting and full of tension each hand.

Good action game, with a hand management element. Fluid, easy to learn and explain.

The scoring system is ok (mix of set collection and network building), but not the most intuitive; I prefer the one in other Knizias (Ra, Beowulf, Modern Art)...

An auction game in disguise, where you don't bid with money, but play influence cards instead. Nicely balanced, but one or two of the special cards may be a bit too powerful, as they are never discarded. I played it with 5 players and it was surprisingly enjoyable, without the chaos you usually have in other games with so many players. But I suspect it could be even better with 3 or 4, as the special cards would change hands more often.

[EDIT] Suffers rather badly, I think, in comparison with Knizia's later Beowulf. In particular, coming in second or third doesn't hose you nearly as badly in the latter.

RATING: 5
I really thought I would like this.  How wrong I was.  A very boring, repetitive, insanely dry, themeless bean counting game.  It scores a five instead of a much lower score because it is good at what it tries to be, however what it is trying to be isn't a very fun game in my opinion.  The card auction mechanism is pretty cool, and is definitely the high point of the game.  Someone should steal the card auction and use it for a decent game instead of driving another "build the castle, score the VP" bunch of crap.  The problem is that there aren't that many meaty choices to make in the game and there isn't really a lot of different things to do on the board.  The game would seem way too light, except there are about 10 different scoring methods, so most of your brainpower in a turn is spent trying to figure out how you can score the most with the cards in your hand.  Its hand management with crackhead scoring.  The auctions are interesting, hand management is nice, but the dry drop a castle, grab a chit, score some Veeps isn't very fun for me.  

Update:  played this again, understood everything that was going on, played fairly well, and still didn't like it.  Just not my type of game.  Super dry, super repetitive, and overall just not fun.

Another subtle and well-balanced masterpiece by Reiner Knizia.  This game is filled with tense and exciting auctions, although your choice of actions on each turn is very limited:  bid more cards, or withdraw and lose all the cards you've bid so far.  You have to decide when to take your lumps and withdraw, and when to fight to the end.  A bit of bluffing doesn't hurt either... but you also have to learn when to call other player's bluffs!

RATING: 7
Taj Mahal is quintessentially "Poker: the board game" and achieves this quite wonderfully through a series of constraints. Namely: 
1. No hand holding: Taj Mahal provides a very limited set of cards for you to work with. You go overboard one hand? Get ready to suck it up in the next few ones as you lick your wounds. The game is all about the tension of doing the most with the least while others are trying to do the same.
2. Diverse yet limited scoring paths: Taj Mahal has two major pathways - set collection and palace connections. Both are viable, and provide their own sets of challenges and possibilities. Having only two means that they are choke points as well as paths: when 2 players go for each in a four player game, the game just lights up.
3. The in/out mechanic means that the stakes continue to rise, but not always as you'd expect them. There's the obvious card cost which is clearly spelled out: when a player matches your symbols, bailing means not getting anything. More cards are required. However, there is a more subtle cost: prizes also disappear as the hand progresses -- some might run with their winnings as soon as a marginal advantage presents itself in order to fight another day. The other cost of continuing things is the possibility of showing up too late for some items.

Overall, one of Knizia's better designs, but too its dismay doesn't flex very well to other-than-4 player counts.

At the heart of Taj Mahal is a mind-bending auction, where each player can drop out on their turn, winning any items for which they currently have the highest bid.  Bids are made through card play, which is restricted to cards of a single color, so hand management is critical and you constantly have to agonize over whether to sit out an auction in order to build up your cards, risk a continued bid (using up even more scarce cards), or drop out to conserve your resources.  There are a few main routes for scoring, each of which requires implementing a long-range strategy, and the riskiness of each strategy depends entirely upon what strategies the other players pursue. This is a fascinating game, whose depth seems to grow with each play.

Original, replayable and very well craftted game. Simple rules provide deep gameplay as only Knizia knows how to do.

This game doesn't appear to be anything more than another Knizia auction special at first, but...
The board has a very simple yet Indian flavour to it.  As the player markers accumulate, the colorful palaces are attractive, and the picture improves as the game builds out to it's end.
The many tiles are also attractive to the eye, and the overall artwork is quite nice, but not overwhelming.
The auction is quite interesting, because winning can be prfitable, but so can dropping out at the right time, and one has to always balance when to win with when to drop out- and of course part of the price of winning might be over-paying and putting yourself out of the next decision round.
A very enjoyable game, not quite as streamlined as Ra, but perhaps slightly more thematic, and quite competitive.

The game of playing chicken with poker hands in India.  

I like the drafting aspects of the game, as well as the push-your-luck (or, more accurately push-your-nerves) style of gameply, but the game can feel very unfriendly most of the time.

It doesn't see play time as often as you'd expect, and I think its score may dip sooner than later...

It's a very clever design, but I have to drop it a few notches for a couple of reasons:

-The learning curve is pretty steep. It's really hard to figure out what a good move is.

-A poor, misguided player can suicide and take you out of contention without ever realizing it. 

The game probably gets better with a group dedicated to it, but I don't think I can convince the usual suspects to play this once a week for a couple of months

(04/2011) Comment based on 1 play.

Another Knizia area-control game, with cards. Like every other Knizia game, this is simple to learn, fast to play, yet has some subtle and complex decisions. I don't recall being too excited to play again, or to go buy it, but I'd play it again. Initial rating "7".

(05/26/2014) First time playing it in over three years. We all concluded that this is a very good game, and that we should bring it out more often! However, the card play, the symbols, and various funky rules reminded us of how difficult it is to play well, as well as remember how to play it. Play focuses around competition in the various provinces in India, where players try to build a string of castles and claim commodities. For each area, in turn order, each players play a card, with a number of symbol(s) dictating what category(s) they are competing for within each district, whether it is for the commodity in this area, or one of four personalities. Subsequent players can bow out, but if they are not leading in any of the five categories, will get nothing. Bowing out earlier allows a player to draw more cards from a common area, while bowing out later means fewer cards. If another player plays a card with a matching symbol, there is "competition" in that category, and the other player can play an additional card to increase the number of symbols. If no one else competes for a category, the player who has played the symbol will get the commodity of that city (scoring VP that is dependent on set collection) and/or a personality token. Two tokens of the same personality must be turned in, which gives the player a special "white" card that allows boosting of specific symbols during competition.

As described above, the game is somewhat difficult to describe, yet starts to make sense within a few rounds. Knizia is famous for making players think in unique and mathematically challenging ways. He is also famous for amply rewarding players that optimally play the "right amount". You may think you are winning because you played powerfully one moment, but Knizia has a way of penalizing you for overextending yourself in another. Taj Mahal is no different. Still, sensing what is the optimum is rather opaque--it is difficult to discern whether one is playing well or not. It turns out that the player who is not playing too aggressively nor too passively will win the game.

The game has excellent components, especially the castle pieces, which are made of high-quality plastic resin. Visually, the game is pleasing to watch unfold. The rules and mechanics take awhile to wrap one's head around, but become intuitive thereafter. I think this is a much better game than I thought three years ago. It is surely a "great" game, but it is rather understated, as it may take a number of plays to realize this. It is a solid "8".

(09/07/2014) Update after 3 plays. This game is getting a resurgence in our group, hitting the table more often, as it combines fascinating card play similar to Bridge with tense board position/network building.

Fantastic descision making with card play.  Do I hold off and save my good sequence for the next region, or do I lead into it now?  If you enjoy card counting, you will have a definite advantage.

I played my 2nd game on 4/18/07.  I think I played this years ago, however couldn't remember much of anything about it.  It's a somewhat confusing game to get started and will take you a game play before you know what's going on and what strategy to use.  It does take a while though (1.5 hours) for the first game.  It's fun and has a good balance of luck and strategy.  I'd recommend giving this a game play and consider playing every once in a while, time permitting.

Mmm, tactical auction goodness from Knizia.  I must say Taj Mahal is one of the better designs by Reiner and an enjoyable, tight game that can be played in a reasonable amount of time - all good marks in my book.  Players can focus on short term profits, build up a late game scoring engine, play conservatively to accomplish what they need quickly turn to turn, or blow their wad all in one go.  There's lots of variety, depth, and elegance with all the charm you would come to expect from the the good doctor.  It's a fun and well done complex game without the heaviness typically associated.  In short, it's damn good.

Update:  This game is pure genius.  The level of complexity so innocently captured in the simple rules is really quite admirable.  With equally matched players, play can be absolutely brutal and devestating.

I had put off playing this - in part since we had just learned [gameid=9440] (which I enjoyed) and didn't feel the drive to break out another game with the country of India as a backdrop.  Although some of the piece-parts from the two games seem similar, they are very different games beneath the hood.

Taj Mahal is a very Euro feeling game (in a good way) - e.g., multiple ways to score, managing your resources (in this case cards).  The game is completely card driven, and the rules are very intuitive once you've played a couple of turns.  I feel as though there are multiple ways to win this game (but will have to play it out a few more times).  I like that "cards in hand" provide some 'hidden' scoring at the end of the game.

20+ plays later I have yet to grow sick of this game, or even feel like I have come close to mastering it. I still can't properly pull off a Elephant strategy.

I like Taj Mahal for two mechanics: the chaining of palaces, and the "auction" to win the right to place palaces. Where to chain and why is a really interesting question because of the random set-up. You may have to play cards 3 times in a row to get the palaces you want, but that heavily depletes your hand. 

The main reason to play, however, is to participate in the battle for palaces. The entire "auction" is brilliant: the fact that you can only play cards of one color background, that you have to withdraw to win, and that ties garner neither player anything. I keep coming back for those battles.

Best with 4

A bidding game in which the currency (cards) is precious, and so you don't want to overpay for things, but if you're short by one, or just out of position in the turn order, you get nothing. A great game that I would never turn down but probably not suggest. It's easy for someone to do really badly in the game, which makes for good tension, but you really need the right players.

RATING: 10
Set collection:hand management:bluffing:auctions:network connections

Original comments:  6 plays now and I'm very tempted to give this my first 10 rating as I find this fun unlike some people who may not have given this a fair chance, it will take anywhere from 1 to 3 games to fully grasp everything that is going on so be sure to give it that chance. More plays will confirm for me if it's high in replay which I think it is. All plays were with 4 players which would be the most balanced number for this game by far from what I can see, which is not to say it doesn't work with 3 or 5, just not quite as well... 

A STRATEGIC MASTERPIECE through and through and very unique and elegant as well. If you failed to see the elegance here then it is likely you have missed the beauty of the whole system, also if you think there is too much luck you should really play the game some more as this is one of Herr Doktors most luckless games. Lets also address the "Giant game of chicken" comments right now too, while there are some chicken wars to be had (which is one of my favourite parts of the game) calling the game a 'Giant game of chicken' is complete crap. Really, there is way more going on here than that and you might only get into one or maybe two "bidding wars" per game (1 or 2 rounds out of 12), at least if you know what you are doing but I guess I can see why those without a plan or who have little experience with this game might feel that way. 

Like T&E, it might take you 3 plays just to have a general clue on what the hell you should be doing (especially if you learn by yourself like I did), only then can you try working on all the multiple ways to score, some nice depth in this game but it is still quite accessible. There is so much to think about every single time you have to do something but not to the point of AP as long as you can retain a fair amount of details (actually at times you can feel yourself drowning in all the data floating around), decisions do get somewhat easier with more plays but alas always remain difficult to some degree providing great turn angst. If you really got some depth upstairs you can try adding 'counting cards' to the details to retain as to give yourself more of an edge...don't play this one for money with card sharks!

Poker influence (when to fold vs. push your luck and bluffing) along with set collection and network connection are all big parts of the game here. There is lots of planning through the whole game and these are long and short term plans. You also have to make tons of strong tactical decisions throughout like: when to fold first IF you can in order to place a palace where you want, do you fold first to get the cards that you need, do you fold first without playing to get an extra card and guarantee the cards that you want, do you want the resource from building or the VP chit, do you hold out to win the province influence, do you try to keep your paths connected, do you stop the other guy currently winning from connecting, and several more things to all come into play. On top of all these decisions, you need to perform the ultimate balancing act between cards, special cards, auctions, resources and network connections in order to beat good opponents. Another brilliant game design from the doctor and my fav from him so far. 

We knock this game off in 60 to 90 minutes, a perfect length for such a deep game, turns are also quite fast so your always involved (after enough plays) and every game is tense between good gamers. 

[u]UPDATE:[/u] The game is now maddening, I was loving it and now I'm hating it (in a good way) as I can't pull off a win and it has become quite the challenge, rating stays where it is however...GRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

[u]UPDATE:[/u] Rating edged up a tad more and ... YES! I finally juggled enough to win this game, what a ride I tell ya, between knowing (planning) when to have the occasional chicken war and just taking what you got and running it is one hell of a game!

[u]UPDATE:[/u] More FTF plays have confirmed this to be my Favourite Euro 4/06. I should note I am often a "gut" player, and this game really lends itself to that, so other gut players that like games with depth will likely take to this well

[u]FINAL UPDATE:[/u] After playing over 200 different types of games and playing this over 20 times I now feel confident enough to give this the one and only 10 rating I have for a Euro. This game virtually has it all with long and short term strategy, tactically rich, fun and high in replay (theme is weak however but forgivable). This is my untouchable and now that my original german copy got signed at Essen 06 it will never leave my house!

[u]Tidbit[/u] - The fan created 2 player variant is OUTSTANDING, sure wish I would have discovered it/tried it much sooner, one of my favourite 2 player games and I think a thing or two can be applied to the 3 player to tighten it up.

RATING: 8.75
Played for my first time in 2009 -- embarrassing, but I'm glad I did. Difficult decisions, delicious strategies, and anticipation of others' moves all meet in this quick to play and visually attractive game.

There was a slight learning hurdle for me to overcome, but by round 3 everything clicked. I won my second game of this--woo hoo!

This would have been a 9.5 for me if I had discovered this when it originally appeared. Even still, it does everything elegantly. Perhaps a bit too much luck in that sometimes things can just fall in your lap but at other times everything is a battle. The game's short play time 90% overcomes this element.

A little too chaotic with 5 players. Recommend 4.

Edit: Just played it again with 3 other vets and 1 new guy. There's definitely a one-game learning curve. I still think the game is an 8.75--just a little TOO much going on rules-wise/scoring-wise and just a little TOO chaotic, but TM still maintains its awesome elegance-strategy-intensity-duration factor. Highly recommended. (Ob. nitpick: Cards need a reprint--just one side (left, right? -- pick one!) only for the icons please--confusing to newbies and unnecessary to vets.)

Knizia game with a Mogul-era Indian theme. Based on a couple of games, I would have to say I find this one of the best of Reiner's games. Like typical German games, it's quite abstract, but unlike most it's *very* strategic (ie. you're rewarded for long term planning), and also very unforgiving of even minor mistakes... I like Knizia games, I like auction games, I like the theme. What more need I say? :-)

Initial Rating: 6.0 (August 2015)

Nowadays, I expect almost nothing from Mr. Knizia´s games, so when I played Taj Mahal I wasn’t expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised. However this game was designed on 2000 so it seems I do like his earlier designs. 

Taj Mahal is very reminiscent of Maharaja: The Game of Palace Building in India. They both share theme and some mechanisms.

The rules are very easy to grasp, you can explain the game under 10 minutes and the playtime is around 60 minutes (with fast players). The game components are good and they look gorgeous on the map. The art is ok.

The theme is also ok, I don’t like it nor dislike it. It feels thematic for a Knizia game but in reality the theme is rather thin.

The luck of the draw exists but I feel it can be mitigated with clever play, you (almost) always can win at something, you can pass first to grab better cards to fight another day or you can skip the current turn to draw even more cards.

Taj Mahal features interesting decisions (namely which prize you will pursue in each region, but these decisions have far reaching consequences) and the gameplay is very tense and fun. You have to have the majority in the faction you want to score, and each faction gives you different bonuses and VPs. It also has an spatial element because where you build your palaces matters a lot. To summarize, the game has a lot of depth for such a simple game.

Bottom line, Taj Mahal is an ok game I would like to play from time to time. I already sold my copy of the game BUT this was done because I’m in a contracting game phase and I already have Maharaja: The Game of Palace Building in India, a game I like more. If requested I will play happily. One of the best Knizia´s games I have played.

Repeated iterations of chicken with some plastic pieces and cards to accompany.  This game is not as dry as it appears.  However, there is a large potential frustration factor when having to back down having spent three cards for absolutely no board effect, and unfortunately this colors my opinion of what is otherwise a solid game.  This game makes me angry almost every time I play it.  It's my problem, not the game's.

Wow. Did I get my butt destroyed! Loved this game and I got schooled.

I had a huge and intimidating hand that scared players in the game, but it was useless!! I was getting buried in the game,  but I worked my way back into the pack by the mid-game. I had no shot at winning, but I was damn proud to get back into the pack.

This is a very good, but trickier, Knizia game. It takes a bit to get your head into the strategies. I can not say I would fare better on another play, but I'm willing to give it a shot!

Battle it out for commodities, and/or plan your provincial scheming to drop some long connections on opponents late in the game. Push your card play as far as you can without going over the edge to ruin. 

The board and components are top notch (those tiles are THICK). The five colors chosen for the pieces are disappointingly drab and too similar, but that's a pretty minor quibble.

Can't say that I'm consistently good at this game or really have it "figured out," but it's a fine challenge nonetheless.

Know when to fold them and walk away! There is nothing more costly in this game than to get involved in a battle with another mule headed person and continue to throw down card after card in the hopes if winning one little battle. Even if you win the battle it may have cost you the game. So next time take a deep breath, think rationally, and do the right thing...whatever that is.

The set-building card play, multiple ways to score, and somewhat variable board are all Knizia trademarks and work to great effect here. If you over play one hand, you better get something for it because it won't leave you with much for the next hand, which leads to the only criticism I can think to make - that there are a few rounds in each game where you just don't have the cards to do anything and there's not much you can do about it. Still, the game as a whole works wonderfully. Challenging without too much brain burn.

Muy buen juego en el que tratas de construir palacios en la India.

Aunque el tema no es su fuerte es un juego muy entretenido y con índice elevado de tensión, sobre todo hacia el final.

Se van jugando las 12 provincias una a una durante la partida. Cada una de estas provincias tiene unas ciudades, que has de tratar de ganar mediante tus cartas, ganando las ciudades por mayorías.

Un juego en el que hay que saber jugar bien tus cartas, y también retirarse a tiempo, ya que tiene sus ventajas en muchas ocasiones.

Sin duda alguna un buen juego, muy fácil de explicar y muy fácil de entender.

Very good game, you have to build palaces at India.

Theme is not its strong point but it's a very kept game with a high grade of tension, specially in the last part of the game.

You have to play around 12 provinces in a game. Each one has different towns that you try to get playing your cards, with a majorities system.

It's a game that rewards a good hand management, but you have to know when it's time to retreat, sometimes it can be the best choice.

No doubt, a great game, easy to explain and understand.[/color]

The doctor really knows how to do an auction game.  I played this once many years ago and was unimpressed.  A recent play has caused me to re-assess it much more favourably.  You should be able to race through this in an hour - there is not a lot to it.  For a straight auction game it has the right level of complexity.  If this game were made now, there would be lots of pointless VP tracks and resource management.  This is pretty elegant.  I still don't like straight auction games much, but this is one of the better examples.

This game has a satisfying, addictive quality to it. I'm so-so on poker, but in this context I find I really enjoy the poker/bluff elements, mixed in with the competing networks of palaces. The Indian theme is clearly very pasted on, but the art and motif is so pleasing and so nicely done, it doesn't matter. Chalk Reiner Knizia up for another masterpiece.

Update: played 3 times and still love this game.  I've played 3 5-player games, and I've come in 2nd in all of them - I just can't seem to get over that 'hump' and win this game! :-)

Excellent game. It is very difficult to do everything you want. There are a number of counter balancing ways to score points and clever mechanisms to pull the losing player back into the running.

There is a great deal of bluffing and press your luck with the cards as well. Everyone is in constant conflict with each other. Push too hard and you won't have the resources at vital times.

One of my new favorites.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I've heard Taj Mahal praised as a masterpiece and bashed as glorified "Chicken." I found it to be neither. The mechanism at the core of the game does resemble chicken: you have a hand of cards in several colors, and each turn you choose a color and then play cards of that color until A.) you decide to pull out for a reward, B.) you are forced to pull out because you have no more cards of the appropriate color, or C.) all the other players have pulled out. Strategy is quite abstract but at least interestingly diversified: watch the public card-draws made by other players, charge-up power plays to collect particular tiles of cumulative value, pull out of the auction at the right time in order to gain certain advantages, secure placements on the board that create valuable chains. A good game, but a bit of a hodgepodge, and a thematic lightweight.

Update: I've been thinking about this one off and on since trying it for the first time, and while it seems like an interesting game in theory, I just don't have that much desire to bother with it at the moment. That might be me more than anything. There's a lot of "game" here, but I'm not sure I have the temperment or the patience to "get into it."

I really enjoyed this, but wasn't expecting something that seemed so abstract. Your cards have different items. You are trying to put cards down with the most items to bid in six simultaneous auctions. It sounds confusing, but once you play a round it is clear. You try to win Taj Mahals to place on the board. If your Taj Mahals are connected between regions they score extra points. There are also some bonus items that you can win for more points.

Difficult to say something meaningful about this game ten years after its release other than it's a great game which has been proven by time. It's as close to a card game as a big box boardgame can be while the positional play on the board opens up dimensions not available to card games. Best of both worlds! Tadsch Mahal is one of the rare cases where good tactical play is as important as strategic perspective. All of this comes with relatively simple rules - a rarity for meatier Eurogames today.

Excellent game. One of the best Knizia's game. Multiple scoring choices. You have to build palaces and connect them between provinces for a high score. There 5 powers: economy, army, social, religious and political in the cards and The Grand Mogul. Play that cards against your opponents in a poker style to try to gain control over those powers. Each power allows you to build a palace. FUN!!!

After around 3 plays over the last few years, I'm still strangely befuddled by the game.  I'm beginning to suspect that it is a subtle game of kingmaking.  The one that comes out on top is the one who was defended the least.

This game has a huge potential. Problems are that figures of different characters should be a bit bigger while displayed on the cards and you can lose the whole game when you simply have to win something on an area and you lose it after 7 or 8 cards. Really only meant for 4 players. With 5 it can be too cruel and with 3 too non-confrontational.

This game is kind to newbies, giving them a chance against experienced players. Over the course of a few games though the better players will come out on top - an ideal scenario in my view. The auction/bidding function is quite unique and involves signalling strength and intention.

RATING: 7
Based on 3 plays.  I'm eagerly awaiting the reprint of this game so I can play it more often.  However, Taj does have a few flaws which lower its rating.  The internecine conflict mechanism is interesting, but feels too chaotic and punishing given the lack of any room for negotiation.  The games I've played have also seen a fair amount of king-making towards the end, which is never pleasant.  Still, the other aspects of it are good enough to compensate for these shortcomings.

Okay, so I finally got my paws on this game.  It is a really fun bidding and push your luck sort of game.  There are many ways to score in the game and timing is VERY important.  I have yet to win this game.  I just can't seem to get any of my strategies to play out the way I want them to.  This can be a very fun, exciting, and frustrating game.  Certainly not a gateway game.

2017-12-21 - 6 - It's a fine Knizia which didn't blew my mind, but provided a number of interesting choices and I could gladly play it again. We'll see, it could grow on me with more plays although I don't know if I will play it more.
It could really use new edition as many other Knizia's classic, which were released recently.
It wasn't as stressful and painful as some people claim, but I could see that it can be played this way sometimes.

From my SR:

...It seems like this is not really an auction in the normal sense, but maybe more like a betting game like 5 card stud poker. After every round of cards you have to reassess your opponents' cards and your chances of winning, and then decide whether to add another one of your precious bidding cards to the pot in an effort to win something or to fold while you can...
...I'm not sure what to make of this game yet, but I would play this again.

Some game icons difficult to differentiate at a glance, which make some of the art, though quite beautiful, also distracting. Good game play and strategy once you get over initial hump of learning rules (which aren't that difficult, although they seem at first to be.) After additional plays, disappointed somewhat in "chicken" nature of auctioning and difficulty of coming back after a poor start.

I didn’t like the theme of the game, collecting elephants and different coloured characters and I found the point scoring confusing. However it is a good game and I particularly enjoyed the auction mechanic which made a welcome change to the usual coin bidding war. As usual for Knizia there are many strategies to try and as such is a game that should see the table more often. It’s a clever game that I would score at least 7 were it not for the theme. It also finished in the stated time with 5 players, 4 of which were new.

I had originally thought of rating Taj a 9, but further plays have suggested that it's not quite the game I thought it was. It tends to play out in a very similar fashion every time, making it hard to differ one play from the next. I have no qualms with those who call this Knizia's masterpiece as the design is very solid. It's just not MY Knizian masterpiece. [b]7.5[/b]

There are lots of interacting ways to acquire victory points in this game.  I think there is something of an issue when two players decide to fight over a certain round, since it can leave them both significantly weaker, with one ending up with nothing at all.  I'll have to play a few more times to see how well it all meshes together.

RATING: 10
What a fantastic game. Definitely 10.  A lot of hard decisions to make: every round you have to think carefully when to spend your cards and what do you really want: more palaces or more goods? What the others might to do/want? And then: how to get all of that as cheap as possible. Ah, this one is a classic. Great example of gametype which ones I really love.

RATING: 8.6
Rating after first play; might change but not by much. Another great complex Knizia. And as for the role of luck: we were 4 players playing; the first and second place went to the players who were not beginners.
After later play: yes it is great. The only problem is it just feels a bit the same every time I play it, even if I try different tactics. Still it's a great game.

RATING: 7.5
[2006.Dec.04] This is one of Reiner Knizia's heavier offerings. (See "Amun-Re" and "Tigris & Euphrates" for his other heavy games.) In typical Knizia fashion, it gives players numerous ways in which to score points. Be warned, this game is all about hand management and knowing when to cut your losses. If you're not the type of person who knows when to say "I'm out", then this game may not be for you; otherwise, give it a try you won't be disappointed.

Played 4 times.  My opinion of this game has dropped steadily since the first game.  Initially, I really liked this game.  It's sort of a pseudo-auction, and that means I should stink at it.  Even the loser of a battle could get something in the end though.  After each game, I was more annoyed, for non-obvious reasons.  I think I just never quite grasp when and where to pull the trigger in this game, and it ALWAYS seems that the other players are winning points almost randomly.  Points are won sort of majority control style.  It seems that the winners are those who win the most areas by spending the least resources BUT why the spend the least resources seems more like luck and less like strategy.  I'd be ok not playing this game again.

For me, Taj seems solid with 4 players, and 3 too.  I really dislike playing this with five b/c the disparity between first and last place is so wide virtually every time I've played it 5-handed.  This may some times happens even with 4.  By mid-game, it's virtually impossible that the laggards of a 5-plyr game will even come close to competing - either through a falling behind problem or runaway leader issue.  With 3 or 4, there is more chance of being able to catch-up and come from behind.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
From what I understand, the game is ONLY good with four.  One seeks to gain points in various ways from taj mahal route connections, scoring different tiles of different products earned by card play which also accumulate over time, and through special cards and chits.  All these are won via vicious card play in which you can generally only play cards of one color.  You have got to know when to hold them AND when to fold them in this game as losing cards for nothing will really set you back in this game.  When its your turn, if you have the majority in either elephants, any of the four princesses, or the throne guy, you can exit card play with a score - otherwise, you must decide if you want to lay another card to contest a princess or elephant or fold.

Témájában, külalakjában és stílusában hasonlít a Maharajához, mégis jelentős különbségek vannak a két játék között, a kézben lévő "haderő" fokozatos kijátszása (licitálás) pedig a Condottiere-re emlékeztet.

A játékot kicsit száraznak éreztem, de be kell látni, elég jól kitalált szabályai vannak, amiket ráadásul egyetlen játék alatt rendesen el lehet sajátítani. Szóval könnyen tanulható és teljesen nyelvfüggetlen játékról van szó. A játék 13 fordulóból áll, minden fordulóban a 13 tartomány valamelyikében folyik a küzdelem. A tartományokban legfeljebb 5-5 palotát lehet felépíteni 4-4 előre meghatározott - utakkal összekötött - helyen (egy helyre akár két palota is felhúzható). A cél az, hogy a számunkra legmegfelelőbb helyen/helyeken sikerüljön palotát építenünk, mert ezért pontokat vagy kártyákat kapunk, vagy esetleg a négy termék egyikét. Minél több palotámat sikerül úgy felépítenem, hogy egy útvonalra essenek, annál több pont jár érte. Minél többet összegyűjtök az adott termékből, az is annál több pontot ér.
Palotát az építhet, aki küzdelmet nyer az adott tartományban. A kezünkben lévő lapokon öt különböző szimbólum szerepelhet, és egymás után vagy kirak ezek közül egyet az adott játékos, vagy passzol. Passzolás esetén megnézzük, hogy hány színből van neki a legtöbbje kirakva épp, és annyi palotát felépít az adott tartományban (0-5 db-ot). Utána az adott tartomány esetén a passzoló játékos már nem küzdhet, a többi játékos viszont a maradék színekért építhető palotákért igen. A végén mindenki kap/választ néhány lapot a kezében lévők pótlására. Persze vannak ehhez még egyéb tudnivalók is, nem ilyen egyszerű ez, de könnyen elsajátítható és nagyon jól kitalált rendszerről van szó.

Folyamatos döntési helyzetet jelent, hogy lerakjak-e a kezemből lapokat küzdve a különböző színekért, vagy inkább maradjak ki az adott csatározásból és újabb lapokat felhúzva erősítsem magam, hogy a következő tartománynál már ne lehessen senki, aki legyőzhessen. Ha küzdök, a többiek kijátszott haderejét és a sajátomat, valamint a kezemben lévő lapokat összevetve el kell döntenem, hogy meddig folytatom a küzdelmet, és mikor szállok ki. Küzdök-e több színért is sok haderőt feláldozva, vagy megelégszem kevesebbel.
Nyert csata után döntési helyzet, hogy melyik csomópontokban építsem fel a palotámat. Nem egyszerű ezt eldönteni, mert pl. "A" helyen felépítve sok palotám válik úttal összekötötté, "B" helyen felépítve plusz pontot kapok, "C" helyen felépítve plusz lapot/terméket kapok, "D" helyen felépítve pedig keresztbe teszek a többi játékosnak, akiknek pont az hiányzik sok palotájuk összekötéséhez.

Szóval kellően összetett (de nem túlbonyolított!), gondolkodós, és kicsit blöffölős játék, tetszik. Tetszik az is, hogy lehet látni előre, hogy mik lesznek a következő tartományok, azokból mit nyerhetek, és annak függvényében, hogy az mennyire fontos nekem dönthetem el, hogy milyen elszántan kell majd küzdenem érte. Nem tetszik, hogy a már lerendezett tartományok nem igazán játszanak szerepet a későbbiekben, egyedül abból a szempontból, hogy hogyan vezetnek az utak és kiknek van az adott csomópontokban palotájuk.

A játék - bár analitikus gondolkodású agyhoz illik, mint pl a Tikal is - nem igényel sok számolgatást: ötnél tovább nem nagyon kell benne elszámolni, azt is csak a palotaépítéskori pontszámításnál. A távolabbi jövővel kapcsolatban is inkább az érzésekre lehet csak hagyatkozni, előre nem kiszámolható, hogy mi lenne a legjobb lépésem. Ez előny, hiszen így nem tölt el senki hosszú perceket azzal, hogy kiszámolja a különböző döntési lehetőségei várható végeredményét, mint pl. a Tikalban, nem lassul le a játék. Hátrány, hogy minden tartomány lezárásakor a húzópakliból ki kell rakni egymás mellé a hét legfelső lapot, ami ugyan 20 másodperc csak, de akkor is holtidő.

Szívesen játszanék vele máskor is, de nem érzem azt, hogy most rögtön mennem kell a boltba és meg kell vennem.

One of the things that I like about Taj Mahal is that it tempts me to be greedy.  My turn will come around and I could withdraw and get the princess, but I see that I might be able to win the monk as well if I play another card.  So I end up playing the card and then my turn comes back around, the other players have foiled me, and I end up having to retreat without getting anything *and* my card supply has been precariously run down.

RATING: 10
While Taj Mahal’s reprint a couple of years ago was hotly anticipated, it did not seem to produce the acclaim it deserved. Before the reprint, it was a holy grail for board game collectors because it is a candidate for Reiner Knizia’s best design. It is definitely one of the most distinctive eurogames I’ve ever played.

First, it is the only game with randomized setup that is strategic because it lays the entire landscape of play out at the start. Right away, you know what you are fighting for and when. The only unknowns are the cards you use to bid, and an observant player will have a good idea about them, as well, after a couple of rounds.

Second, the way the auctions are evaluated whenever a player withdraws is ingenious. It creates a delicious tension between conserving resources and not wanting to leave openings for your opponents to drive through and seize, freezing you out of a key objective. Added to this is the tension between dropping quickly to seize a choice palace location and sticking things out to try winning more.

Plenty of euros, especially those with an area control element, feature tough choices based around choosing your battles so you don’t waste scarce resources, but no game does a better job than Taj Mahal of tempting you to commit just a little bit more. Often you are not only cutting loose sunk costs, you are genuinely tempted by unexpected opportunities, only to be defeated at the last second and left bereft. While the failures can be crushing, the tension is delicious and the victories all the sweeter because of the high stakes. Layered on top of this is the irony that moderation will get you further in the long run.

Tak Mahal is not just another auction game. The rhythm and the decisions are unique – it hasn’t even had many second-rate imitators – and a pleasure. Every eurogamer owes it to himself to try it out. It’s one of my top ten boardgames of all time and a masterclass in game design.

What a game! Many, many ways to score points, the auction mecanism is neat and force you to "pick your fight". Withdrawing early is key. Don't try to fight a losing battle as cars as very hard to get.

Taj Mahal is a subtle game of choosing your battles, much more so than most auction games.  Different players using the same bids to bid for completely different prizes pushes your ability to know when to quit or not.  Great fun.

Very interesting hand-management mechanics.  Standout Eurogame with a poker-ish feel like none other. Downside is that it doesn't scale particularly well. I think it really is only a 4-player game.  Also, the graphic design on the cards could really be improved.

12/2006: Somewhat dissapointed after first 4-player game.  Establishing connected provinces seems the most flexible way to go for accumulating points.  BUT the only safe strategy seems to be "card counting" to ensure that one gets one of the prices (and the desired map position) after the first round of bidding.

Very interesting game, a bit tricky to learn but once you get the hang of it the game is both fun and deep. Almost no luck factor, though uncertainty adds interest. Fellow gamers I've taught it to have really liked it across the board.

This game can be hard. You have to pay attention to so many things. And you must constantly watch what other players do. Scoring is cruel and if you fall behind too far you have no chance to win this game. Nevertheless this game has a very very high replay value. And once again: ALEA rules (German) are fantastic. No questions are left open and very easy to understand. Great work Alea and great work Mr. Knizia!

I have to say the more I play this game the more I think this is Knizia's best game. It is such a satisfying game. It works on so many levels. It's a game of ebbs and flows and knowing when to make your move and when to lay back.

Gaming goodness at its finest.

Interesting game with a big learning curve. I recommend playing it once through a partial game before starting a full game in earnest. It has a large number of scoring mechanism, which can be difficult for a player to grasp until he's played the game through at least once.

RATING: 6
Nah... don't think I care for this much.  You can save and save cards, put down a ton of them and get nothing in a round.  Or you can put down a single card and just happen to get 2 of the rewards in a round.

I feel like this is the game of the best laid plans going wrong.

It's too bad, because I like the way the cards work and such.

I finally got around to playing this game and I wasn't impressed.  Maybe my expectations were too high?  Maybe the learning curve is a bit too steep?  I just feel like there are better games to spend my time playing.

Awesome design.  Knizia has finely tuned this one to maintain tension from start to finish, with moments of delicious agony as you try to decide whether to throw in that one more card to try to take that auction, knowing your neighbor MIGHT have the resources in hand to make you pay DEARLY for the attempt.  I love this game.

Didn't enjoy this much. Trying to analyze why:

1) No sense of progression: what you do in round 12 is pretty much the same as round 1. There's of course a bit more palace inter-connection and resource values differ per person, but the math is similar, the feel is similar, and the game just feels repetitive. Each bidding round is also the same decision multiple times (i.e. What percent do I win now if I quit vs if I continue? Do I care that much about this round or I should focus on next?).

2) Virtual elimination: The last 2 rounds were just me and one other person vying for first (we ended up tying score-wise), and 2 of the 5 players were out around round 8 or so. Having absolutely no chance of winning but still having to play another 30-45 minutes seems pretty bad... and their decisions became more and more arbitrary later on (which affected how the rest of us did).

3) The special 4 cards seemed rather over-powered; for instance, getting 2 bonus points every turn. In fact, the person who tied got nearly 20% of their points from the one special card (yellow). We all re-checked the rules since this seemed so bad halfway in...

4) Runaway leaders: Similar to comment #2. Basically if you're ahead, every item is worth more to you (e.g. gold/tea/etc, special cards compound to make you win more, etc). Just keeps amplifying your lead.

5) Somewhat arbitrary failure: One player's last card had him in the lead on 3 categories with 3 people left, and I had to back out immediately after; the other player played a card which tied him on all 3, so he got nothing (no more cards left). After that he was out of game (finished 2nd last), but I couldn't really fault his play... just very bad luck. Made the game seem more arbitrary to me.

6) Very minor, but I feel the player colors need to differ more.

On the pros side, I like the idea of inter-connection with previous decisions (though in practice most I and others got was 3; people would block and you needed to win two of four or crown), and the crown sharing a space was good. I think scoring only if you get resource or elephant means most players don't score most rounds, which led to wide disparities in score (first place had ~60 points, last place didn't get to 20).

This was a great game.  If it wasn't OOP I would want to buy a copy imediatly.  Can't wait to get to play it again.  Heard there was a reprint planed.  Can't wait. 

I loved how there was a lot to think about and do and plan for but not so much that your brain hurt.  It was just the right wieght for me.  (I did play it with 4 which I hear is the only good number to play it with.)

Just played it a second time, and it wasn't quite as fun.  I did notice that it seems that one player is constantly screwed.  Which makes it not very fun for at least one player.  I don't like games that arn't fun for all involved.  Will have to play again to see if that was just the nature of our playing style or truely something in the game.

This game seems to provide an excellent combination of long-term strategic planning with tactical card play.

This is one of those games that I am so desperate to play but cannot get people to play. Worse is that this game needs 4p to be great.

Cool, unique, interesting and fierce "bidding" mechanics. Much spice is added on it that make it more subtle and heavier than some other RK's bidding games, say Ra and Modern Art. Components are good in both quality and quantity. But being win nothing in a bidding round is unforgivable, since there are only 12 chances. Taj Mahal is rather abstract and the theme is just pasted on it. 4 Players only! (*Bidding, Connection or Set collecting)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Love the components and the game is involved with lots to consider.  My only dislike is that getting into a battle with your left hand opponent is often devastating.  Saving cards for multiple turns only to be outbid by one hurts and can ruin the remainder of the game.  Card management is essential.

Typical Knizia: low on theme, high on tactics. Clever design, various ways to score, etc., but somehow doesn't really grab me. Would probably like it better if it was presented as the abstract game it is. Nothing really wrong with this game, but not very inviting either. Maybe would have worked better if the artwork wouldn't be so bloody bland. 

Maybe I should give it another try before I put it on the trade pile.

An elegant, big, Knizia bidding and placement game with a few different paths to victory.  You can win with a placement strategy (placing palaces on the board that connect to palaces in other regions) or with an ecomomic strategy (earning commodoties who's values are aggrandized, the more you own).  Or perhaps you could try going for an equal parts placement and economics strategy but you'll probably need to play more defense against your opponents.  The card play mechanism is very simple but makes for some very tough decisions (increase your influence which ultimately will weaken your hand for further turns or get out early).

Good, but not great. Multi-dimensional, but there is some luck in the cards (although the face-up cards help mitigate this). Also, kinda clear what everyone else is doing, unlike in many Knizia games. There is some degree of the "take what is given to you" element that makes Princes of Florence so great.

Would rate higher if it played better with 3 or 5 players.  Still, this is one of Knizia's best.  Game play has a poker-like quality that seems to appeal to almost everyone I've seen play it.  Multiple scoring options allow for sharp tactial and strategic play.  Plus, here Knizia does more than paste on a theme.

RATING: 8.5
Played once.  This is a highly interactive game where players bid against each other for influence over each of twelve regions.  The bidding system is very neat: players place one or two cards that influence one of the six things in each city that can be bid on.  Players continue bidding in turn order until they withdraw, at which point they lose all the cards they play, choose two cards from the refresh area, and compare the amount of influence they have in each area in the city.  If, at the time they withdraw, a player has the most influence for any of the six categories, they win that category.  I love this bidding system, as it rewards tactical playing and prevents the bidding from just becoming a "who can stay in the longest" game (especially because the last person left in the auction only gets one card, whereas everyone else gets two).  

This game is all about the card management, and is very intereactive (as your bids must necessarily take into account everyone else's).  And, in true Knizia style, there are lots of ways to earn points (e.g., in my first game I won the game without winning a single province token).

Played twice now....ok this game is hard to wrap your head around first time for sure but once everyone gets it after 3 or so rounds start over and play the game.  I thought Samurai scoring was difficult to explain...this one is a humdinger for sure but great bidding system I love it.  Most likely will go up after some more plays.  I'm guessing 4 or 5 is best though.

OK, yet another over-rated multi-tasking Euro leaving you with a "so what" feeling. Uninspiring board, nice bits, but again so what? Yes, it's clever but is that enough to pay hard cash? Not really. Rahtehr than a feeling of accomplishment, the cleverness of the system detracts from the feel of creating a plan which is very subject to the luck of the cards. I won't be in a hurry to play again.

It took a while for Taj Mahal to grow on me, but at this point it very well could be my favorite middle-weight board game. Although initial plays will run into the 90 minute range, I think you can keep it closer to 60, where there are few other competitive board games of this weight, especially for more than two players. Hansa Teutonica would probably be everyone else's choice; in fact, when folks were falling in love with Hansa Teutonica, I played this for the first time and found it to be the better game. Both have a nice mix of mechanisms, many ways to score, and a relatively quick playing time. But while Hansa Teutonica (like most other popular Euros) responds well to mostly tactical, short-term thinking, Taj Mahal requires players to think strategically. Your plans might not work out, but if you just go with the flow then you won't win very often. All in all, Taj Mahal squeezes a lot of game into 60 (to 90) minutes. A very satisfying, if occasionally frustrating, experience.

I really liked this game a lot, but I am a bit worried about the scoring discrepancy, which had two of us far and away in the lead for most of the game and the other two lagging in the rear, nowhere near being able to close the gap.  Of course, it took time for we first time players to realize the power of provinces, so I wonder if they are over-powered.  But other than this, a beautiful, elegant Knizia design.

A brilliant game that cleverly merges all the great Knizia mechanisms into a fascinating and tense whole. The best part is the hand management and how it works with the bidding for each region's rewards. The special cards, especially the Princess, add an interesting twist. Each game is very different, too. The way the map mechanism of scoring connected regions is very clever, too.

Only a couple of cons: 
- best played with 4 players only because there needs to be even competition in both the elephants and connected cities strategies. 3 and 5 players will usually let one of the strategies break out and run away.
- the map and general scheme colouring is drab and difficult to read. The graphic artist could have made so much of the many colours available from Indian culture and history.
- I love the game but I suck at it! I need to be more aggressive when bidding for the Princess.

Maybe because the gamme is "old" and other games have moved the auction meechanic forwards since its publication,I find this game too long and too repetitive.

The alternate scoring methods of placing palaces and bonus tiles are misleading if you dare to rely on them; only trade goods appear to be worth the effort to win. Aside from that, the game's strategic flow feels arbitrarily constricted by your cards. Not a favorite.

One of the best games of Reiner Knizia, Taj Mahal is an auction/placement games which is surpisingly deep for a german game. It's one of those games that actually makes strategy so much more important than tactic, so this is definitely for the dedicated gamer. The only complain I have with this is that near the end of the game a third player can often decide between two other who will win...

This one started off fun enough. I like the game of chicken that revolves around playing cards of a color, and trying to cash in when you have the most of a symbol. The problem is, the game goes on entirely too long for what it is. This game should be at most half as long as it is, as it becomes very repetitive after awhile. I think the decision space is interesting, and the bidding that goes on feels very unique. I also really like the route-building aspect of placing palaces, but the game just feels like kind of a slog at this point. I would much rather play something like Ra or Medici that packs the same tenseness in a much shorter time frame.

Playing this reminded me a lot of Rialto, but whereas that one was almost too bare-bones, Taj Mahal feels like a better design. It just needs to be as short as Rialto.

Got to play for the first time on May 30th.  Another great Knezia classic.  I like this one.  I can see why it ranks so high.  The scoring is a bear, as with all of his games, but I loved the different aspects to the game.  Its got auctions, linking areas together, gathering resources and set collection.  A keeper and if your a Knizia fan, this is a must.  Tons of strategy in this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Taj Mahal combines bidding and area majority and spice it with various set collection mechanisms to create a rich but hot stew. The core of the game is simply to fight over regions and score points by a) connecting previously placed palaces, b) earning powerful followers or c) collecting sets of similar goods. So far, nothing new.

But what really sets Taj Mahal apart is the bidding system where you take turns to play cards with values in six different categories. As soon as you pass, you claim the rewards for the categories you have a majority in but you also withdraw from the other categories, which may give your opponents opportunities. So do you accept a small reward to save cards for future regions or do you go all in for the big reward, potentially ruin your hand for the next round? The Indian cuisine is nothing for the faint-hearted!

Taj Mahal is a design that I have a lot of respect for, and as a game it lives up pretty well to that respect.  I am terrible at the game, but I still enjoy the different paths to victory and the different elements that work well together.  To me, Taj Mahal feels like the final evolution of Knizia's other auction games.

It could be because I am bad at this one, but it seems like the players don't have enough control over what they win in a province to really make a strategy around winning certain things. I believe that I am probably in the minority in this, but that is how I feel.  The biggest knock I have against Taj Mahal, however, is that it just doesn't grab me.  I don't need a strong theme, but either the theme or the mechanics need to draw me in, and neither do. It just feels dry.  It's a good game, and it deserves more play, but there are other games I find to be more fun.

In this Knizia game, play cards in a visit to Indian provinces to win influence in 5 different things. You win those items if you have majority of those tokens on your played cards or if everyone else drops out. Very tough decisions to make on each visit on whether to battle the other opponents or to withdraw. Different paths to victory make it playable again and again. My only criticism would be that the game can be quite confrontational in one player matching another player symbol for symbol (eg the last place player does this to another player). Plays best with 4 players; we had some bad experiences trying to play with 6 players with the white pieces and 5 players is also quite crowded.

This is a nice abstract game with a reasonable standard Knizia theme (which is to say "light").

Some clever bluff and counter-bluff card play, choosing when to drop out of a round and the rewards you get provides some interesting decisions. Sometimes it was better to drop out of a round and sacrifice your presence in an area to be in a stronger position for the next area.

Good game, but probably not one I will be desperate to play again.

The auction in Taj Mahal is weird, but interesting.  You have to throw the same color of card every round, and depending on where you stand in each auction you get to place your pieces on the place of your choice.  Some auctions have goods and some give special abilities.  The game is quite interesting in how it decides who places where and it takes awhile to wrap your head around.  You will score points at the end of the game for connected networks, amount of goods you have, and perhaps something else?  It was awhile since I played this. 

I would like to play this game again, but I found it quite tough to pick a strategy and make it work throughout the game.  I enjoy it, but my players will scratch their heads at this one I think.

Everything is there, that you expect from a good game. Strategy, tactics, bluffing, tension, excitement and it is quite short. The feel of the game depends on the number of players, and it is providing a different kind of challenge with each player count. I like the balance of VP earning strategies best with 4. With 5 the commodities strategy becomes stronger, and withdrawing from a few auctions could be necessary; with 3, the auctions are not competitive enough any longer, and the connection strategy can become too strong. A real gem.
Third highest rated multiplayer game on BGG from the year 2000.

After my second play, I think I understand a bit better. You need to pick your battles more carefully, you don't want to try and go all out in each place. It's better to check out the board and find where you can maximize points by getting connected areas, and completely bow out of others (thus getting more cards). The key seems to be building on the points you already have.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This horrendous graphical design (both cover and components) hides a very good abstract game. The mechanics connect naturally to create a game deeper than the standard Dr. Knizia's.

My issue it's the lack of control, especially with many players. There's no way you can "secure" an action and you will likely lose some important bets just by bad luck, not because your rivals are actively trying to deny you. That makes the temple game less profitable.

I personally don't like such a whimsical nature in 90 minutes games with this level of depth, but there are people who will gladly forgive this to enjoy the tension it creates.

In any case, no doubt it's one of the best Knizia's.

Mi è proprio piaciuto. Per nulla banale, molto strategico.
Molte le regole da ricordare e da spiegare per la prima partita. Ma come spesso capita poi il gioco risulta abbastanza semplice anche per gli esordienti.
L'interazione è molto alta ma anche la componente fortuna non è assente. In media però si ha sempre la possibilità di pianificare in anticipo le proprie strategia data la scelta delle carte da aggiungere alla propria mano.
Io lo consiglio.

An interesting bidding game where you have to pay what you bid, even if you lose the auction. (I guess that's not technically an auction?).   A lot of strategy involved but the rules are fairly simple.

RATING: 7
Whatever you call it: last man standing, blink, war of attrition, or bluffing, this game has it in spades on the tactical side.  Combine that with several interlocking strategic-level scoring mechanisms, and you have a really intense game that isn't too brain-burning.  Also, highly replayable.   Undoubtedly one of Knizia's best games.

[b]Taj Mahal[/b]

[i]This game fell completely flat for me. The different actions in the game did not coalesce into a fun gaming experience. The set collection is very basic and underwhelming, the route building served as a means to an end, but the bidding was somewhat interesting although it felt clunky. 

I think that sums up my feelings on this game perfectly, Taj Mahal is a clunky and counter intuitive game to play. Where as I feel that Medici, Modern Art and Ra all offer elegant and simple rules, my play of Taj Mahal felt like a slog. The previous 3 games can be taught in a matter of minutes and even if you don't play well it's more of a lack of understanding of the perceived value of the various items you are collecting; the actual bidding/auction mechanics are clean and intuitive. I can't say the same for Taj Mahal, and there is really nothing there that is calling me back to play it again (especially since I could be playing Modern Art, Ra or Medici).[/i]

Hmmmm...  One 3-player game.  Immediate comparison was Maharaja which we also rented and tried recently, but I liked this one slightly better.  I can see from the comments that the calculating folk hate the chaos and chances to get smacked down on a bid.  

I thought it was interesting as we got more brutal, matching each others' bids as the game went on.  We had some back and forth leads as the game progressed.  3 players felt like I could look at the cards available, drop out early, and hoard enough to be sure of at least winning something.  I made the come back victory over the last 4 or 5 provinces to be scored.  

I think it is possible to use some strategy within the constraints of the cards you get.  Is there risk that someone else will outbid you despite your plans?  Yes, but the game would be kind of bland and samey without the chance of failure.  

I'm still not sure if it would get too samey with repeated plays, and I can see that 5-player would be much more unforgiving than 3.  I think I would like to try 4 and keep it to 3 or 4.  In an unlimited game world, I would buy this.  Right now, I'm moving it down my wishlist because there are just other games I would rather use my time and money on right now.

I really liked the subtle background art, but I think the provinces could have been slightly better delineated--a dark line for the borders.

One of the early games from Reiner Knizia which established him as a legend in game design. And I've really fallen in love with his games; they're uncomplicated, efficient, intuitive and fun. Perfect, really. And Taj Mahal is no exception. It's an auction game with network/route building, hand management, and set collection that works with several different strategies. If you're feeling lucky, you can play in every one of the twelve rounds and you might win something; it doesn't always pay out, but that's the risk. Smart, determined players who don't mind sitting out for some rounds can save cards and dominate in a given region, linking their network for more points and taking bonus cards on the way. I thought that Ra has perfected and distilled the auction mechanic down to its essence: pass or play. But Taj Mahal has a tension and thrill that isn't present in Ra. It's a very unique twist on auction games and a joy to play. I love seeing the face of a player who thought they were winning, only to realize that they wasted their cards to not gain anything during a turn. That may sound punishing but I promise it's more enjoyable than frustrating. I can't wait to play it again!

Depending on the day and the player mix, I either really like or dislike this game. Been too long since I played it. You build sets of stuff by moving around a map, gathering cards, picking up tokens and so on. A lot going on at once and the theme is molecule-thin. Needs to be revisited.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A game that I can recognise as solidly designed and can enjoy it for these reasons, but which tends to aggravate me when people get knocked out of contention by getting sucked into an Asian Land War which they can't afford to lose. Where both the winner and the loser are drained of all energy. Could closer observance of cards picked up and other players' strategies have avoided it? Maybe. Usually not. You invest 1, 2, maybe 3 cards, you can't tell how committed people are and how far to push. When you're up to 8 cards, you can tell! It's an aspect I don't enjoy and is enough to lead me to mostly avoid the game. The ensuing issue is that each game provides an inconsistent experience to each player - you can be winning some stuff easily and really enjoying the game with the leaders, or get knocked about early on in a key battle and find the rest of the game dull being out of contention, there being no "get back into the game" mechanism given that points snowball with each round win.

1 play - this was a very interesting game, which has a lot of indirect interaction through auction-like mechanics. An optimal move is pretty much entirely dependent on other player turns and the state of the map. 

It creates a very interesting puzzle and VPs are actually satisfying to earn (which I don't always find is the case in dryer themed VP games), as you place components onto the board collectively building a city. 

Surprised this game isn't ranked a little higher. I personally would rate higher, if this were a genre I enjoyed more.

RATING: 9
Classic game that combines area control, network building, and a brilliant auction variant in one very tense and tight game. Some have complained it is too brutal because you can spend a lot of cards in a round only to get absolutely nothing and you still have to pay your cards. Yeah that can send you to a loss and that is frustrating, but I believe that aspect is influenced by poker and poker would suck if you got your money back on hands you didn't win. Hand management and timing must be handled with some degree of skill and this is very much a game that rewards repeated play. It is difficult to find a game from the modern era with such streamlined rules and play and few components yet with such a high degree of depth. You must stay on your toes though as mistakes can be costly.

I love it.. so much going on here.  Taj Mahal is one of the most successful combination board game and card game.  These 'two' games are densely interwoven.  It is as good as [b]Amun-Re[/b], and thus ties for the best Knizia.  The card play is poker-like, not based on a trick taking system.

I've seen this described as an "auction" game, but to me it really has the feel of some sort of trick-taking game.  Regardless of what you call it, though, it's really a lot of fun.

TRY Mar/06: I've borrowed this from a friend, and this game appears to be EXCELLENT!  Lots of different ways to score, lots of choice about when to stockpile cards versus taking a risk and scoring points, lots of ways to screw opponents thru blocking, bluffing, etc.  I've only given it a test-spin by myself so far, as a 4-player.  5 would be more cut-throat; even with 4, the one player got completely hosed and took several visits to recover (and never caught up in the scoring).

Felt like bits of: Aladdin's Dragons x Lowenherz x Louis XIV x China/KuK/Web of Power.

I can't wait for the reprint!

The game really shines with 4 players and I wouldn't bother playing it with any other number.

I'm a Knizia fan, but have never heard of this one. Yet, I think it deserves a place in his top 20, maybe even at the bottom of his top 10. 

Likeable game with a strange combination of gameplay: 1) an auction mechanic based on the concept that the first to bail out with the most objects wins the object's bonus 2) placement of buildings to create chains  3) set collection of goods, 4) bonus points/cards strewed around the board and ready to pick, and 5) end scoring bonuses.

It seemed complicated, but we all understood the rules in about 15 minutes. Although, it's a little finicky (compared to Knizia's usually elegant rules) in terms of small little rules you can forget. It has a few rough spots, but that doesn't change the quality of the gameplay itself. 

Theme-wise, it is banal. But the gameplay can be tons of fun like Knizia's best. The central mechanic of the auction is classic Knizia:  simple but full of strategy. You change your tactics continually through the game since your card hand will change continually. The randomized board gets some good replayability. 

One complaint is that the components are lacking. The board is lackluster and the card artwork can often be confusing and hard to spot across the table. I'd like to see a makeover of this.

Really good design. Did not click with me though, so not sure if I will be looking forward to play this in the future, but I am not writing it off.

Like Settlers you evaluate the randomised set up to determine a potentially productive strategy before play. The difference between these two re-freshing (replayable) methods of setup is that in Settlers the worth of placement is visually done for you, whereas in Taj you have to do the sums yourself (skilful for math minds, but painfully dull for me). Unlike Settlers, Taj involves so much serious mental work to play well(such as memorising opponent drafts)that there is little fun. May only be viable for 3 players as the elephant tactic may dominate play, and besides more than 3 players means chances of being out bidded and waiting longer for the round to finish.

 Excellent poker variant.  There is a lot of player interaction and the games can be very tense. Caution: players new to this type of gaming can have a very difficult time and it tends to mess the play for others.  For some reason this is not an easy game to grasp for newbies even if they are poker players. It is one of the best bidding/bluff games available as the players are 'bidding' on items that have different values to different players.

This is a game where you bid cards with different symbols, trying to get the majority of one or more symbols to win the ability to place your palaces on the board spots. Ideally you want to work so you make chains of your buildings to get the most points. There is a lot to like here, but the downtime between turns is very high with 5 players, and the game works out to be a little to chaotic. You can find yourself fighting hard for key spots and then missing your opportunities to connect to those spots making the previous effort meaningless. It's fine, but it could and should be a lot better.

A truly beautiful game in concept and tension. I don't mind the thin theme as this is normal for a good Knizia game. As an electronic game it is practically a perfect 10. As a board game it loses a little in that its plays just a little slower and fiddly than I wish it would.

A games that only makes sense once you start playing it and even then probably not earlier halfway through. The game is essentially a card-game with some bluffing and hand management beefed up with some placement and tile collection (yes, it is a Knizia). However, in this case, I found that there is less skill involved than in many other Knizia games and a lot comes down to luck in this game (That is, if you consider random actions by other players luck). It might be something you are used to when playing a Knizia game, but this one is particularly ugly and the 'theme' or visuals add nothing to the enjoyment of the game, let alone making easier to play. The cards are really confusing. Why show two elephants on the card when it is worth one ? I thought this was okay. A typical Knizia that is missing that certain something that most of his other games have.

I first played Taj Mahal when it was out of print and after just getting into Euro games in the early aughts.  The way a dehydrated man loves water, I loved Taj Mahal.  It's a game I always come back to and, in my opinion, is the best bidding game Knizia ever did.

I like being able to fight both strategic and tactical elements in the board games I play.  Taj Mahal has both and yet the two elements feel distinctly separate from each other.

The game constists of twelve rounds, one for each of 12 abstract regions ostensibly in India.  The only named area on the board is Agra with the Taj Mahal.  Each region has items players can pick up, things like tea, rice and jewels.  Players will also place palaces on a network of roads that connect the various regions.  Here's where the strategic part of the game comes from.  Goods provide points when you get them and additional points everytime you get another good of that type.  And palaces provide points for when placed, but they provide additional points when connected by road to palaces from other regions.  SO from the outset of the game you want to plan for where your palaces will go and what goods you are going to pick up.

Because this is a Knizia game, you are going to have to bid to get these things and this is where the game becomes viciously tactical.  Players collect cards throughout the game and are simultaneously bidding against each other for six different opprotunities to place palaces and get goods.  If you have the high bid on any one of the six when your turn comes around you can drop out and claim your goods and build palaces.  If not, you can still bow out or you can play another card and try to stay in the auction.  It's a big game of chicken because cards are currency and if you spend too much you hurt yourself for future auctions.  If you spend too little you don't win what you need to.  It is entirely possible to blow your whole wad and get nothing.

There are going to be key battles that each player would very much like to win.  And then the game can get competitive.  If a player is really on the ball they can time their bids for when no one else has cards.

RATING: 5
Only played once. I don't like auction games very much so this game from the start did not have a good chance of getting a good rating from me.

What annoyed me during my first playing is that I played passively; I focused on winning auctions that no one cared about. The competition was so fierce for the elephants that I was able to monopolize on the princess for a very long time. I was also able to get quite a long chain of palaces built without much planning on my own.

To be fair, I think this was the first playing for almost everyone, and because it's an auction game with dramatically different ways to score points, no one could have pursued a decent strategy.

An interesting game. Not quite sure where I stand on it, so I will not rate it yet. It will also take a few games to get a feel for a good strategy. I came in 2nd or 3rd out of 5 without taking a single region tile. In about the 3rd round I was going to make a break for getting one, but it seemed that everyone else was as well.

I reluctantly (at first) played my second game of this tonight with three others. Now that I had atleast a basic idea of what to do, I tried for the region tile from the start.  I ended up almost emptying my hand on several rounds, but I did have two special cards which helped. I was able to repeatedly chain buildings, and got 11 points in the last round, plus 4 for cards. I won by about 10-15 pts, ending at 55. I enjoyed it better than my first time, but I don't think I'll play this that many times.

RATING: 4.5
A surprisingly complex game, with a large number of choices; very difficult to analyze due to constant player interaction.  Unfortunately my enjoyment of the game the one time I've had a chance to play was ruined by someone determined to keep me from scoring any points (I beat him by 2 points anyway).  I might play again some time, and might raise my rating of Taj Mahal if I have more fun that time, but it seems the game itself makes it far too easy for this to happen. UPDATE: played again, with reasonable players, and still disliked the game, and didn't have any fun.  Dropped my rating by a point, and hope I won't have to play this game again.

So tempted to give it a 10. Tense, the scoring system is brilliant and the poker mechanic works really well. Plays quickly with 3. Games are over in under an hour. Only Ra beats this Reiner classic. Losing a big bidding war can put you out on your ear with 5 or 6 players though.

I think this game is slowly building on me. My first experience was a bit of a 'WTF', but subsequent plays have been more fun even though I never remember to quit early on some bids where I'll lose :-) Basically, it's more of a card game that's disguised as a boardgame with a nice theme anyway.

A very cleverly designed game about the power-struggles in medieval India from designer-god, Knizia. You "visit" the twelve province of India and try to obtain as much influence and economic power as possible. You do this by taking part in a very clever auction with some new twists, while trying to manage your hand too. Crucial to know, when to withdraw - monitoring your hand and second-guessing the plans of your opponents are two important tasks in this beutyful game.

Component Quality:
Excellent! Tons of great looking palaces pieces and a sturdy well-organised board. The box insert fits everything perfectly (even if the cards are sleeved).

Gameplay:
There's more to this game than originally meets the eye. Lots of different game mechanics competing for the spotlight, without any single one taking precedence. The scoring system was simple yet innovative and made for a tight game between all the players. Winning relies heavily on the ability to plan ahead, though there is some luck involved. Being first player is a huge boon.

Too complicated for its own good. There are far too many scoring venues for a game that's ultimately a series of card-driven bidding rounds. It really didn't need so many elements.

RATING: 7.5
Clever tense bidding system competing in multiple scoring arenas.  This is certainly a game of confrontation, but it really it seems to me like a game of deal-making: you offer the other player a way out with face (take the orange leader and a palace and an extra card) and I'll have blah blah.  Inherent in the offer you make is the understanding that you both risk your game position if you can't quickly make a deal.   The game does seem a bit brittle, so that if the situation is mis-read and two players refuse to make an early deal, they can take each other out of the game.  I am not convinced that this is a flaw despite having been burned by it recently (7 cards for not ONE thing!) as it puts the pressure on to find a solution.  I like it, it plays in a reasonable time, and gets the heart racing.  The negatives are a spurious theme, a bit of grind in the calculations, the potential to be badly hurt by someone else's bad play, and the fact that is seems to polarize people with some strongly disliking the evil tension of the bidding mechanic.

I got this out for the first time in a while the other night and REALLY enjoyed the game (even with our rule mistakes).  I'd like to get this to the table again soon, as the rating might move up for me.  I like the simple range of decisions you have to make, but with far reaching consequences.  It's well crafted and flows nicely.  Great game!

I've played it again since then and really like this game a lot.  It's easy to teach (once you have it down) and has great decisions during the game.  I just wish they had used better colors so that I could get it to the table more (lots of color blind gamers in Nashville).

Peças muito bonitas (embora as cores sejam questionáveis) e um tabuleiro minimamente agradável, que não coadunam quer com os tokens, quer com as cartas. A jogabilidade é complexa e demora alguns jogos a ser verdadeiramente compreendida, embora seja um jogo que rapidamente se começa a jogar. Em minha opinião sofre de um mal que muitos outros jogos da mesma complexidade também acusam, ou seja, o sabor é muito ligeiro para o tempo que demora a jogar, dá muito trabalho para pouco sumo e isso faz com que não o apeteça jogar frequentemente.

KNIZIA CLASSIC 
One of Herr Doktor's standout titles from his heyday.  An auction game that does not really feel like an auction.  Very interesting gameplay without unnecessary rules overhead.  For those put off by only a veneer of theme and IMO somewhat weak graphic design there may be some complaints.  But an excellent one-hour euro-classic.  One of those games every BGG-er should try at least once.

A very well designed game that really puts you in difficult choices.  The game play is really quite simple.  Play cards or withdraw.  The scoring is a bit fiddly though.  Choosing when to play and when to withdrawal also has a poker type feeling which is good.  However, the game thematically is disjoint and really is  just non-existent. Unfortunately, for me,  it seems to miss the mark on the fun factor though.  It was just dry and just okay for me.

One of my favorites!  The only other game which I have given a 10 to is PR.  Knizia's scoring system is so multi-faceted, but still easy to grasp.  It gives you many ways to seek victory, with no two people doing the same thing.  But, even with all of this variety there still manages to be fierce competition over limited resources like cards and goods.  A great bluffing card game with board game elements like unit deployment.  Another great Knizia game.

(+) Original mechanism, interesting dynamic.
(+) Very exciting as you build up certain actions resulting in huge potential gains in points in the final rounds. The end race to the finish is very tense.
(+) The game plays quickly with relatively simple rules - yet it offers many interesting decisions. A lot of game comparted to the small investment in time and rules explanation.

(-) Unfortunately there is a rather serious luck factor. You can push your luck by playing smart, but a small portion of misfortune in the final rounds could potentially cost you a huge amount of points and lose you the game.

Tentative rating.  i just played it for the 1st time last week and was more or less pludding along because there was so much going on.  I have no certain opinion of how much I like the game; only a good deal of curiosity.

Online, i've heard the game being described as being a big game of poker or chicken, but i don't think either description is really accurate. It seems that the gut instinct approach to the game is to make big long-term plans, but the reality is that you need to cut your losses very frequently and not be Captain Ahab. Greed is the emotion that is constantly being checked.

I think 'nuclear arms race' is a better analogy than 'chicken'. Chicken is a game where you get bragging rights for having no fear. Even if you end up in a bloody tangle at the end, there's a certain pride you can take in saying, 'dear lord, those handlebars hurt!!'

In contrast, nobody wants to go down the unpleasant route of thermonuclear warfare. you hope your opponents will be rational and understand that you have basic, urgent needs to be fulfilled. You wish your opponents could see how kind you are at heart and that you wouldn't use the threat of using nukes if the situation wasn't so desperate. Mangling your opponents is the furthest thing from your mind; you are only using the tools of persuasion available to you.
That's what taj mahal feels like. It's greed in the same sense that thirsty people will glut themselves at a drinking fountain, and not the way jack welch amasses wealth through GE.

RATING: 10
Fucking brutal. And don't listen to anybody who tells you it's silliness, or unstrategic, or chicken on steroids. Demanding, constant strategic vision, many-turn planning, hand management, bluffing, outguessing, and outpsyching your opponent required. 

UPDATE:
The more I play, the more I love this game. It sort of asks that you ride the breaking edge of chaos, tracking way too much data about who's trying for what and who pulled what cards. It demands that you make a sweeping plan, and then subjects that plan to every humiliation and depradation in the book.

I want to play, I want to ravage, I want to destroy.

there are several interesting and subtle mechanics, but they don't come together to provide players with enough control.

Interesting Knizia, that mixes many different mechanics together. The hand management is important, expecially the bonus cards are very powerful.

I would like to play this game more, but because it lacks the theme, I fear that it's going to get overshadowed by other games.

After one play feels like a game with lots of ways to win the game. We tried many different strategies and it still was quite even at the end. It's very highly rated and of course Knizia so not much can go wrong here.

I have no idea how to play Taj Mahal well, but I do recognize quality when I see it. This is one of the great Knizia games, even if it has been somewhat cast aside since its initial success. It's full of those excruciating decisions that make Euros so good, and the simple rules mask a challenging game everyone needs to play. It's about as close as Euros have come to stud poker.

Just when I thought I'd had enough of limited depth of strategy in german games I play this. My favourite of the big-box Alea games (so far), it has lots of bowb-factor, long term strategy (go for palace connections, resources etc), and short term tactics in the bidding wars. I love it :).

Upgraded this game to 9. It's one of the more "heavier" Euros, as it must be played several times to develop successful strategies. Beautiful, tense and really fun game. Especially with the right (gambling, bluffing, swearing) crowd.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Tricky system of bluffing and knowing when to fold. If you want to memorise cards you can take it to another level. It's grown on me after a few plays - enough to want to keep playing it anyway.

It's a pick your battles game where you have some idea where you'll be in with a shot at winning but observing which cards the other players have been picking up. There's a very good card selection mechanic here where the first to pull out of a battle gets first choice of the cards on offer for future rounds. Add to that the strategic scoring goals laid out on the board from the beginning of the game, the character bonuses, and what you get is a very good game where the sum of its parts come together nicely. Losing a battle you've invested heavily in, or even winning an expensive battle, can be rough, but that's the fun and challenge in the game that separates it from your usual light and forgiving German board game. I like how it's unforgiving, and if things aren't going well then it's over in about an hour anyway.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Hand managment, thinking ahead and bluffing with a totally pasted theme, as it couldn't be otherwise in an Euro like this.  It gives similar sensations to [i]Meuterer[/i], which I prefer because is more thematic and doesn't have such a baroque and typical of Knizia scoring system.  Besides, there is a snow ball efect, which may kick some players out of the race for the win very early.  Nevertheless, it is not a bad game, keeps your mind busy and provides good entertainment.

RATING: 8
This game is really growing on me. I love how agonizing the decisions are... playing too many cards can be worse than getting no reward with only one card lost. Can be very uncontrollable though, especially with only 3 players, but the experience is enjoyable nonetheless.

This is an awfully hard game to explain, though it's really easy to understand once  you've played the first couple visits.  Another game with lots of difficult strategic (elephants, the princess or the grand mogul?) and tactical (primarily, do I withdraw or stick around for another card, but there are others) decisions for you.  Never really understood the comparison to poker.   A really cool game that leaves you wanting to try it again.

I've played this a number of times online and I think I just don't get it. I won't give it a provisional rating until I play it face to face with folks; but in online-play it just feels like too much to do and not enough control to do it: in other words, random. It didn't grab me, and in fact it left me perplexed.

The central bidding mechanism of this game is magical - multiple "suits" in multiple colours tempting you into a fight you cannot afford to lose.  The castle chains are the most problematic element as they can swing the game if you aren't paying proper attention.

One of the best Euro's around. The more I play it the better it gets.

Brilliant!

RATING: 2.5
Played one 5 player game. I've won. 

Initial impression: 
I know what I did in order to win: Do the most stuff of the same kind from randomised matrix -> get points. Maybe it's also that I don't really get bidding with cards as opposed to open auction or blind bidding (through it's clever the way it's used here). Opaque, counter-intuitive and absent of any real life connotation. On the good side, I like the possibility to make middle range plans (3 turns deep), just enough to make it interesting, but not too brain melting. 

EDIT 1: Martin said it's a good game in here, so a solo play after. 

1. I understand why it's liked. The card play which combines bidding, bluffing and risk taking is the interesting part of it. Actually a very interesting part of it. I missed it as I haven't played it with good players who would make it tense.

2. Unfortunately there's no game connected to it. It's just set collecting matrix that gives VPs. And okay, this is why each person has different agenda in a bidding and what makes the double think interesting. I get all of these. 

3. It's ugly. I hate Power Grid design, but that one has a purpose and agenda behind it, this is just terrible. One of the ugliest games I've seen. 

4. It's themeless. Okay let me get this right: this is not an abstract, there's a certain push towards creating a theme and it fails on each and every count. Theme makes no sense when playing. There's a map: of nothing. There are provinces of nonexistance. Cities and fortresses that float in vacuum of half formed ideas. Compared to this Hansa Teutonica (which I consider an abstract) is ameritrash. Everything is too balanced and goes in groups of four so it makes no thematic sense, yet it's not even elegant as it's fiddly. Just a mess. Worse thing: spices. What the hell? What is that doing in this game? 

5. Games are an experience and this one fails in realising this. It's a machine that lacks surface. I don't think this can be an abstract (fiddly scoring) and it does attempt at making a theme - the attempt of a provincial amateur theatre with no budget and 19th century ideas. 

Conclusion: Somebody needs to do a very impressive thematic and visual overhaul to save the game from itself. [u]Just give me something my willing suspension of disbelief can be occupied with.[/u] I have to play it again with a proper group, but I can't see this going over 5 - it's a half finished work.

[2 plays] The most random Knizia game in my experience. Taj Mahal is a nasty little knife fight of a card game. Card draws can dictate your fate and despite best efforts you may still find yourself on the losing end of a bunch of battles in a row, effectively putting you hopelessly behind. The placement of the palaces seems like a more important factor than it truly is. 

Most recent play Mar '16.

RATING: 8
Yes, it has the typical lack of theme but if you can belive that players are actually trying to get the favour of the royal class as the king visits the regions in India.

There are multiple ways to score and the heart of the game: the card bidding, can make or break a player. Do you drop out early and consolidate resources for a later round or go into a fight to win the most resources?

It's fun and not too heavy on the brain.

A clever area control game with a card bidding mechanic which provides benefits and rewards once a player drops out of the bidding (but is leading in any of the 6 card suits/categories).

A very good game that's unfortunately difficult to find, but it warrants a reprint.

I look forward to trying this with 4-5p.

RATING: 8
Taj Mahal nicely combines area influence with bidding to make a great game, but doubts linger. In Taj, players use cards to bid for dominance in six different categories. This bidding, as many have pointed out, bears some small resemblance to poker: there are four basic colors/suits, there is bluffing, you fold when you no longer wish to or cannot continue, and your card play often "raises" the stakes. (To my thinking, the strongest point of connection is the bluffing.)

The game is played in 12 rounds, each one a battle for placing palaces and acquiring goods in the 12 different provinces of North Central India. Like many a Knizia game, there are different routes to making points (and winning), and you do best if you can balance them out. The six things you bid for are the roles of the princess, vizier, general, monk, mogul, and elephant. The first five give you a palace per role, winning the elephant gives you the goods in the province. Upon scoring, each good you attain earns you one point. Furthermore, you get points for matching goods from previous rounds. So goods are a potent source of points, and their effect is compounded as the game wears on. Also, you get to place one palace for each role you win that is not an elephant. No matter how many palaces you have in the province, they are worth a single point (total). But, if you manage to connect those palaces to palaces in other provinces, each province represented in the chain of palaces is worth a point. You don't get points per palace, but rather points per province connected by palaces. I don't know if this makes a lot of sense, but I want to highlight that there are a few different routes to making points.

The heart of Taj Mahal is the card play. You must make sure that you have enough cards to be competitive in bidding for the various roles, and sometimes it is worth it to skip the fight for a province completely, as this nets you a bonus card.

I have played Taj Mahal with 3 and 4 players. 3 players is great for learning the game, but every single 3 player game I have played in has had a massive runaway leader problem. The outcome of the game is obvious after playing through about 5/12 provinces. 4 players makes for a much tighter and interesting game, where it is really any 2 or 3 players at the end. My concerns are two-fold. First, a player who plays "incorrectly" will not only lose horribly, but will unintentionally benefit another player, perhaps catapulting her to a win over other players who are playing very well. So a learning game or two is necessary. All players must be reasonably competent in foiling others in the bidding process, or the system of checks and balances breaks down. My second concern is that, if all players are playing reasonably well, the win seems somewhat random. I'm not certain that long term strategy has much of a place in Taj Mahal. This leads to a competitive game where the winner feels determined by a die roll. I will say this, I like playing Taj Mahal. It is a fun experience. I'm just uncertain about its staying power right now. I suppose I need to play some more, and get some 5 player games in too. Among bidding games, I still prefer Ra to Taj Mahal, but I'll gladly play Taj any time.

Aki ismeri a Chinát annak ismerős lehet a Taj Mahal néhány mechanizmusa. Tényleg hasonlít egymásra a két játék, de ez a játék komolyabb. A Chinának pont az egyszerűsége és gyors játékmenete, ami tetszik, ennek pedig éppen az ezt kicsit megbonyolító épületlehelyezési mechanizmus és fix kör. A játékosok tartományokba raknak le épületeket, olyan módon, hogy minden tartományon egyesével haladnak végig és ezekben 5 épületet helyezhetnek le úgy, hogy kártyákkal versenyeznek 4 különböző ember kegyeiért, illetve egy plusz palotáért. Egy területen öt palota építhető és egy terményt szállító elefánt vihető el. Egy játékos több palotaépítési lehetőséget megszerezhet, de ez általában több kártyájába kerül, amivel a későbbi körökben csökken az esélye. Jól kitalált mechanizmus, jól működő játék, de jelen pillanatban nem értékelem többre a Chinánál.

Nagyon mély játék a Taj Mahal, megérdemelné a 8-ast, de valahogy olyan 7-esnek érzem magam számára.

Eddig csak négyen játszottam, most volt egy hármas partink és nem lepődök meg a BGG értékelésen, hogy sokan nem ajánlják három fővel. Egyet kell értenem. Négy-öt játékos esetén jobban kijönnek a blokkolások, három főnél lehet nevető játékos.

Taj Majal is a brilliant bidding/hand management game.  Really. Just because I am horrible at this and I can't win to save my life, has no bearing on how I rate it.  After I'd played this a few times I wanted to see what I was doing wrong, I kept trying to grog the game out.  So, I rated the game an 8 then because I wanted to keep playing.

Soon though, because of the harsh losing conditions I found the game more frustrating than fun. A misplay deals worse damage than you would expect, as you not only get nothing if you lose, but your one opportunity to get to a region is gone, along with that you also lose your cards and the privilege to get better cards.  

My real issue with the game play of this is that you can either memorize all the cards that people take or you can play and hope that your intuition pays off.  Most of the time it doesn't.  This is not a game for gut players, or at least not for gut players named Morgan Dontanville.

But, outside of my increasing desire not to play this, my only substantiated problem with the game (outside of the rules being horribly written) is that the theme is flimsy and the card design confuses people.

I can see why people love this game; I think that everyone should try this once to see if they like it.  It certainly is a unique experience that you aren't going to get anywhere else.

Please note: Rating based on one play only. A totally unforgiving game that is ultimately based on luck of the draw. Knowing the strategy and how important the elephant tiles are will probably improve my performance a bit but a game should never have the leader outscoring the loser by such a wide margin (65-19). After losing my first match up and using all my cards, there was absolutely no way to catch up in the game. And, the leaders only get stronger while the weak get weaker, not a feature I don't particularly like in any game. However, I will give it another go before rendering a definitive rating. But for now, Reiner has left a bad taste in my mouth.

I like it a lot now, but it took repeated plays. The auction mechanism and hand management aspects are tough to master. If given the choice, I'd play the similar Ivanhoe or Iliad, just because of playing time and faster setup.

Very cool game.  An intriguing auction mechanic is at the heart of this game.  You must play cards of a single color, yet each card helps you out in only one (or two) of several simultaneous auctions.  Timing is everything, as you have to decide when to play most of your hand in order to strategically place your pieces.  A little luck is involved, but not much.

UPDATE: Although long, this is still one of my favorite deeper games.  I always feel fortunate when I get the chance to play this.

Reminiscent of Condottiere, but with several "currencies", several ways to win the "auctions", and more complex placement decisions on the map. The scoring rules are more complicated than a typical Knizia game, but the rules fit together and the game flows nicely despite the complexity. I'm a sucker for poker-style bluffing games, and this is a good one. Not sure if it's a great one.

There are many different ways to score, so you can make an argument for several different optimal routes to success.  Whatever avenue you choose, make sure you have enough ammunition (cards) if you get in a bidding war, because you can end up with little or nothing to show for it, which is next to impossible to recover from.

Very tough majority game. More than an auction game I found it a bit more like an area majority without the "area" thing. The majorities are for the symbols on the cards but the prize is always there for everyone.

By adding the route palace system, Knizia made an even more interactive game with even more choices, but I don't find this part of the route scoring very positive to the game, it makes it a bit confusing to me. 

A bit longer than I would like it to be.

Amazing game that has you on the tip of your seat the whole game through. The bidding is pretty clever and nasty and forces players to determine when something is worth fighting over and when it isn't. Like many Knizia games, scoring is incremental and therefore mainly tactical. But lose your long-term goals from view, and you'll lose the game. Only played it about 7 times, but the game is still growing on me. Excellent stuf!!

RATING: 8
Excellent auction/hand-management game with a nice blend of strategy and tactics. The gimmick is that players bid in auctions with cards showing 1-2 of six symbols; every auction is really six at once. If you pass while leading in any given category, you win its corresponding benefit immediately, which grants points through route-building and set-collection mechanisms. Timing of passing is important, so auctions are tense games of blocking (better play an elephant so Bob isn't leading when the bidding gets back to him!); better, auctions are everyone-pays, so you really don't want to be forced to pass if you aren't winning anything.

If there's a downside, it's that everyone-pays auctions can and do see players invest large amounts and come out with nothing. It's fine to say that knowing when to fight your battles is part of the strategy, but the randomly available cards can see multiple players unknowingly planning to fight hard in the same category for one juicy target or another, devastating the loser and doing little better for the winner. 

Still, a brilliant little game.

I see why others really like this game, but it's just so-so for me.  I'm discovering I'm not a huge fan of Knizia's games, and this is a classic Knizia game.  Sure the bits are fantastic and the rules are easy enough, but I think the game can have problems at the strategic level with certain groups of people.  I say this because there seems to be 2 fundamental strategies to this game; build lots of palaces to connect provinces or get lots of economic tiles.  If the majority of players tend to focus on one of these strategies it can really throw the game out of whack.  One might ask, then why don't those players switch strategies?  This isn't very feasible because the building strategy only works well if you focus on it from the start.  Switching to building mid-stream is not likely to be very successful.  Thus the game sort of forces you to stick with your initially chosen strategy.  I would pass on this game and play something like Blue Moon City for a similar game (conceptually speaking) but with much better execution.

[Alea 'Tadsch Mahal' 2000 edition] {India; bidding, hand-management, drafting connection, set collection; optimal 4-5p} Taj Mahal is a true gamers' game with multiple paths to victory. Like many Knizia's games, TM has only a thin theme and is built around a convoluted scoring system. Thus, TM is quite abstract and not intuitive. It's deep and multifaceted and is thus brain-teasing and unforgiving. Players have to consider many things: which and how many cards to play at each province, which power to pursuit, when to withdraw, where to place the palace, which province to influence, which bonus/influence tile to get, etc. The rule is clear and not complicated. One minor problem is that it doesn't flow smoothly. Counting score each time when a player withdraws disrupts the game significantly (and each scoring needs some work). 5p game is more competitive and exciting but the down time is stronger (scoring occurs 60 times!)

The "palaces" are beautiful but the illustrations of cards and tokens are just so-so. The bonus token is too small. It's clumsy to stack the oval influence tiles again and again.

An excellent game. Plenty of room for long term strategies, short term tactics and some bluffing. Really agonizing decisionmaking (which is good).

Darling you got to let me know ... Should I stay or should I go?

Such sweet pain. A simple series of 12 auctions, but in each auction you're bidding on 6 things simultaneously. And everything is valued differently by all players. And when it's your turn and you're winning a bid or two do you settle for those items or do you try to win more items but leave yourself open to losing what you could get now? And sometimes it's best to win something first rather than a bunch of stuff later. And don't run short of cards because that hurts like hell.

There's even an official 2-player variant that is simple and works well.

One game with 5 players, all new to the game. Somehow didn't connect that much. As for myself: made some mistakes the first turns and was dead last the whole game due to lack of decent catch-up mechanism. 

This game suffers from the 'as good as its weakest player' syndrome: if everyone knows the game and is playing well, probably highly enjoyable. If people mess up they are immediately out of the game. As ganging up on the leader means about equal pain to yourself. Detrimental in a 3+ player game, and therefore nobody will do it. Meaning you could be screwing up in the first turn and having to sit out the rest of the game without any chance of catching up. And the game is pretty boring if you're not playing for the points.

Probably would rate this higher when played more and with a more experienced group. Takes some time to get warmed up to. Problem is: does it get that time with 200+ other games vying for attention? 

Will try one other time before passing final verdict though. See if its more enjoyable vying for the top position.

Maybe I am an old fogey but so many of these new german games have so many tacked on scoring mechanics. THere are so many things going on here I lose track. My instinct is that too many mechanics are covering up for some inadequacies either in the multi player situation presented or just the strategies would be obvious. Another misconception: I thought this would be more press your luck like poker but in fact it seemed mostly about efficiently using your cards e.g. to disengage and claim your pts or your re draws. I am willing to play again, but my bet is that over time it will mostly lose interest.

The cardplay is a wonderful blend of resource management, bluff and game-of-chicken.

Finally I can say my opinion about this Knizia's son. After playing it with some good gamers I had found its beauty. It's a card driven board game with deeper strategy to follow through many tactic challenge against player to take control of victory source in country. It's difficult to find a winning strategy cause every time you have to watch out what other players are pointing to. Beautiful in 5 players. In my opinion "+2 special card" is too much powerful.

I really like this game, but can't seem to get the hang of it.  Also seems to have problems with trying to catch up to someone, there's no way to really bash the leader in this one and it can be a problem with him controlling what he gets in the future and nobody able or willing to stop him/her sabotaging their own chances for second.

I have seen two separate strategies win though.  I wish the card points were another viable strategy, too often two people end up fighting over elephants or princes.

After one play I am impressed with it.  Of course I won so that usually has something to do with it.  One of the other players however felt that they were thwarted at ever turn by one player or another always outplaying them in the influence they were trying to get (be it the princess, monk, etc) and felt VERY frustrated in their play.

Several plays after still show the frustration of getting outbid, but it is more accepted as part of the game rather than being irritated it can happen.  Great game IMHO.

It's like poker, with a board!  This game is definitely one of my favorite Knizia designs, although it has been difficult to get to the table (damn you, other games!).  The bluffing and second-guessing make for an intense 90 minutes, and everyone is constantly trying to thwart everyone else's plans.  You may have to cooperate with other players to prevent one person from running away with connections or resources, then watch as everyone turns on you the next round for the same reasons.  Good hand management is a definite must.  Four players is definitely this game's sweet spot.  Three players is okay, but five players makes the board painfully crowded.

I see shades of Condottiere and China. With only one play under my belt, it's difficult to assess the game's depth. However, first impressions leave me feeling lukewarm. I'd surely play again, but I would prefer a greater ability to plan. The card play is fun, and there are hints of bluffing strategies, but these felt too subdued to make this game great. Similarly, the area control elements on the board were too difficult to manage given the swings possible during card play. In other words, the game was pulling in too opposite directions, and I'm not sure it ever resolved into something cohesive. Again, though, it was still fun experience -- just not one that I feel a tremendous desire to dig deep into.

An excellent game even though I suck. Probably the best game by Knizia. Five player games are considerably uncontrollable - more lucky? - than four player games, too many players involved and anything can happen in a round. This should be played more often as this requires subsequent plays to get the most out of it.

Good game, though there's some doubt in our group over whether the scoring mechanics are a little unbalanced. You can easily win or lose the game on the outcome of a single round, which makes things pretty tense at times. Losing everything you bid, even if you don't win the auction, is also a nice touch which raises the tension level.

Alea is pretty selective about the games it publishes, and Taj Mahal is another example of the quality throughout their consistently superior line. Taj Mahal is brutal and unforgiving, especially with newer players who expend too many cards for too little gain, but with equally skilled and experienced players, this is one of the most interesting and challenging games going.

RATING: 8.1
Taj Mahal has been excellent both times that I have played. The game is really simple overall and does not have an overly complex strategy. In fact, its simplicity is simultaneously the games most appealing and least appealing trait. I do not think that I will ever get the urge to play this, but at least it won't require a heavy re-learn when playing with other people.

I waited a long time for this to come out. This is Reiner's best game (at least of the ones I have played so far). The game is very well balanced, so optimal play is definitely rewarded. There is some luck involved (e.g., if other people attack with the same color as yours more often than they attack others will make it impossible for you to win), but the scoring options and the interesting card play make this a great game. I have played 4-player and 5-player and feel that it plays best with 4 players.

How many network building board games also boast a simultaneous auction of SIX different items?  It's an experience!  The board is Reagonomics ugly and the card art is confusing, but good golly, the game is great!  When I dream of washing the production values of one game, THIS IS IT.

This game is just an exercise in banging heads. Whoever bangs against the least number of heads wins. Sure, that&#039;s a legitimate strategic element for a game, but it just leaves me hating everyone, especially the guy who won the goods playing just one double elephant card while I just laid out seven princess cards and still lost! If you&#039;re the kind of person who thinks everyone is picking on you, don&#039;t play this game. Because everyone will pick on you.

This is my favorite heavy German game.  It seamlessly integrates beautiful tactical choices with beautiful strategic ones.  I think, of all games, it probably has the card play that I enjoy most.  Psychologically and mentally intense.  (I have not yet played die Macher, so I suppose that could topple Taj as my favorite heavy.)

Kind of a crazy game, and ultimately not very fun. If somebody could get rid of a few of the mechanisms and turn this into about a 45-minute game it could be pretty good.

The cardplay is a good idea but a lot of the bluffing elements don't come through because a player can usually collect enough cards to garantee they'll win in at least one area.

The boardplay is just a mess. You can score points by placing your palaces onto the board in contiguous lines, placing directly on top of tiles that score points, collecting goods with the elephant symbols, and collecting goods by placing palaces. There are also special cards that move around from player to player. To be competetive it also seems like it would be mandatory to remember which cards your opponents have drafted, and that kind of memory element is not fun for me.

Super awesome.  Could ultimately be my favorite board game.... need more plays to find out.  Really tough choices on weather to be confrontational or agreeable for each province.  Randomized set up.  More ways to score points than I care to list.  After being overwhelmed my first game, the game starts to reveal itself.  It uses poker style elements, at least in the sense one can play or fold.  One can play loose or tight, and it behooves you to counter the table. 

There is an immense amount of trackable information, but the game plays quite fluidly and lighter than the amount of information would suggest.  The perfect game design.  The game forces me to crawl into my opponents head.  Playing the players and game system in a perfect delight.  

 Taj Mahal is the game I was looking for, when I first started to search this site.  Thank you boardgamegeek and Reiner Knizia.

Also, Poker tells are relevant in this game.  If someone is strong they show the same body language as they will in poker when they are strong and also when they are weak.  My goodness, I can't speak highly enough of the enjoyment I get from each and every play.

People have a tendency to draw cards for the wrong reason to play.  If you have played and dislike it, try drawing more based on the rewards, instead of the suit type.  If you have 7 of the 8 yellow guys in the game, the most you'll need to play is 2.  The game of chicken that most people talk about I don't encounter.  The connectionists have 5 things to collect, while the elephant people have 1.  Beatiful self balancing.

TRADED AWAY (7/31/08) --- Another highly regarded Knizia classic makes the list. I wanted to love Taj Mahal. Knizia plus Alea was a recipe for high expectations, which is why I gave Taj Mahal 8 plays before giving up on it and trading it away. I’ll start with the best thing that Taj Mahal has going for it, which is that it’s a rare eurogame that allows players to not only make short-term tactical decisions, but also long-term strategic decisions (i.e., whether to focus on connecting a network of palaces or on collecting goods such as rice and spices). Most eurogames are excessively tactical so Taj Mahal was a welcome reprieve from that tendency. However, the game just doesn’t work in my mind. Players are playing cards to attempt claim a few prizes available on each turn, with each prize going to the person who plays cards with the most symbols corresponding to that prize. The problem is that playing the cards goes around and around the table so an arms race can develop, and that everyone loses all of the cards played, regardless of whether they win any of the prizes. As a result, the players who happen to draw the cards and go after the uncontested prizes will win what they’re after easily, and the players who happen to get stuck in card battles will lose horribly. I’ve been on both ends of this and it’s really not enjoyable regardless of the result. For example, player A could get stuck over a few turns in card battles with B, C, and D, whereas B, C, and D are only stuck in those battles with A. Thus, A has 3 card battles, and everyone else has 1. The cards expended in one of these contests are valuable and both players in a battle lose in actuality, even the one who wins, because the one who technically wins really paid far too much for the prize usually, and the winner is the person who was fortunate enough to run off for a different prize cheaply. I know it’s supposed to be a game about picking your battles and essentially folding much of the time to avoid such costly contests, but you’re still wasting cards and coming up empty-handed when you fold and after repeated turns of folding you’re sure to find yourself lagging significantly. I’ll stick to the plenty of other Knizia games that work for me, and leave this to one the poker players.

Edit:I've since played this game again and really loved it.  I'm leaving my previous comments for historical reasons.

[-]My play of this was so tainted I'm not sure I can give a real opinion on the game. We had fundamental rules completely wrong for half the game.[/-]

The way the game works is you play colored cards with symbols to your tableau (following the "suit" of the color you've started), and whenever it comes around to your turn you can withdraw, taking a bonus for any symbol you have more of than any other player (there are six types of symbols), building a palace for each bonus you took, and discarding all your played cards. 

There are special cards that can be played with your normal color cards, and some of the special cards are won by getting sets of bonus tiles, and those stay in your hand round to round. You draw 2 cards after you withdraw (or 1 for the last one out). There is a route building and set collection element.

[-]Some rules we had wrong: How you get palaces, how many palaces you can build a turn, how many bonus tiles are available to win, whether your cards go away when you withdraw, how you score for playing palaces, and endgame scoring. As we got deeper and deeper into the game it became apparent that something was wrong and we finally stopped to read through the rules and fixed it.

I did have a concern about a "rich getting richer" runaway leader problem... but it can probably be countered by dropping out of certain provinces, saving cards and judiciously choosing when and where you want to compete, but none of that was obvious to me on the first play, especially as we didn't understand the basics of how the game worked. So further plays would probably make this a better game for me. But after the bad taste my game experience left in my mouth, I don't really want to play this thing again.[/-]

After playing the game again, with the correct rules, the game was actually a very good game that I enjoyed.  It's a bit sad that my initial play was so horrible.  But that was the fault of a poor rules explanation (did we get any rule right?) and not a fault of the game at all.

About [thing=475][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=475][/thing] is a strategy game focused in hand management, set collection and building routes. In it, players use a limited hand of cards in order to put castles on the board, take goods, points and cards, and/or collect the economical influence of the province.

While the game is easy to teach and has a truly simple set of options for the players (play cards or withdraw), it carries a weight in the decisions and some deep thought, not only about what is happening right now - which province is being disputed, what it has, what cards where already played, what cards are open for taking -, but also what will occur next - cards to keep for later disputes, what the next provinces have in their economy token, and so on.

The replay value is high: the set up is random, both for the position of the goods as well as the order of resolution of the provinces. The draw of cards, for the starting hand and the available for drawing, also have impact on the game.

Production value is fine: the castles are pretty neat, while the board, tokens and cards aren't pretty, but do their job.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Players fight to influence provinces, one by one, be to take goods, gain cards or points (the three types of bonus tiles), add castles and/or receive the economic tiles of the province (all contain 2 goods, except the first province), as well as influence tiles.

In each turn the player has 2 options:
- Play one or two cards (one colored; one colored + one white; one colored + one special);
- Withdraw.

If playing, the first card used can be of any color, but, afterward, the next cards must be of the same color as the first one. The second card played must be a neutral (white) card or a special card. Therefpre, only one colored card can be played each turn - white and special cards can be played alone.

When the person withdraws, she compares the influence she has, in each of the six areas:
- Vizir, General, Monk and Princess: if the person has the highest influence in one or more of these, she takes the connected influence tile (for exemplo, the Vizir tile when winning the Vizir), then places a castle (in open places) for each area she won - if she gets one or more bonus tiles, she scores them immediately. She also gain 1 point for a castle added in the province (regardless of how many) and 1 extra point of each province the player can connect by an unbroken line of their own castles;
- Grand Mogul: the person puts a castle in any spot in the province, even if the place already contains a castle, and scores it;
- Elephant: the person with the most elephants wins the economic tile of the province, and scores it immediately.

After the player finish her withdraw, the cards are discarded, which can influence the withdraw of other players, since now one or more might now be winning areas of influence that they weren't before. Finally, the withdrawing player draws two cards from the available cards. The last person to withdraws only gains one card.

If a player accumulates two influence tiles of the same type, she takes the special card corresponded to it. Special cards can be lost, if another player later gets two of the influence you used to gain the special card - the advantage is that special cards, once used, aren't discard, returning to its owner hand. 

Once everyone withdrew, the visit is over. Play will proceed in the next province.

Play ends when all provinces are visited. Then player scores the cards left in their hands: one point for each white and special card; one point for each card of the color the player has the most.

The player with the most points will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
- Which card to play. This takes into consideration what is up for grabs in the province, the position of it (for scoring purposes of castles), the influence tiles the player has her eyes on (to gain a special card), the other cards in her hand (considering the next cards must follow the same color), etc;
- When withdrawing. Sometimes is clear when to do it: if you are winning two areas, with a single card, is likely good to withdraw. However, this isn't always the case, because isn't simple about what you will get, but what you will be opening for the others to get as well. Sure, you can get a +2 points bonus tile and a fine position for a castle, but if this will be at the cost of giving two influence tiles to the next player, plus the economic tile, will it be worth? After each withdraw, the balance of power shifts, not always for the best for you. On the other hand, what proceed in the visit will net you? Maybe you will only lose important cards, to get the same thing as right now - or, worst, not being able to carry on and lose everything, pushed to withdraw. This is the brilliance of [thing=475][/thing]: a simple action, but with a LOT to think about and to evaluate;
- Which cards to take: is normally best to take colors you already have, or neutral cards, as these usually allow for a quick win of an area. However, it might pay off to go for a symbol, in order to being able to gain the influence required to gain a special card;
- Where to place a castle: be to take a bonus tile and/or to position it to score more now or later.

Overall the decisions are clear, without much complexity, yet all of them have branching elements and can't be taken lightly, as the main two (play, withdraw) have many aspects to consider.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Easy to teach;
- Language independent;
- Great depth to rules ratio;
- High interaction, without being agressive;
- Game starts small and builds up.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- It has some random factors, in the display of cards and drawing (with bonus tiles). This is more true after the initial distribution of cards, but the designer balanced this by making the economic value of the first province worth one good, while all the others give two (as from the second round on you already get to draw cards from the display, making your own hand);
- Scoring of castles can lead to some mistakes;
- Best with 4 players.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Remembering a time where Reiner Knizia was the Grand Mogul, as [thing=475][/thing] is tense, tight, leading to some strong competition, several choices, with a lively pacing. All while avoiding mini-games and an overly complex overhead.

[thing=475][/thing] keeps true to many of the Knizia classics: short rules, few options, while also being able to bring an unexpected depth, many hard decisions, a good deal of interaction (not harmful) and much to think about on each turn. It has that great beauty in simplicity.

Another gem from Knizia! There are many interesting and difficult decisions to be made in this game. While points are hard to come by, the race to control certain areas of the board is tense and nerve-wrecking.

I played this game twice at EuroQuest, and I liked it alot.I think turn order matters more in this game than any other game I have played.  Being late in the turn order lets you react to what others have played.  Going first lets stake an early claim and if needed to get out first.Each card battle can have a very different flavor since you sometimes need to gain a quick majority in one area and then get out fast and other times you need to be ready for a potracted battle.Having first or last crack at a region partially determines what regions are more important to you, and you will have to pick your battles carefully.  If the region isn't important, either grab what you can and get out, or just stay out of it completely and get an extra card.There are lots of things to choose from in this game.

Quite analytical well thought auction game. Various ways to score victory points, but with 5P, it seems that the key to victory is to get or get not enough resources (Screw those War Elephants!), although the  2 "Princess" bonus card may have its influence too.

Apart from the ugly box image, this is a beautiful game. More importantly, it's a blast to play. It's not always obvious what the best bidding strategy is, but there are many ways to the goal. It's a great design.

The colors could be better for people with difficulties in that field, though. Two of the card colors look basically the same to me.

I like the feel of this game. However, I am still unsure of the ins and outs of it. After two plays, I still don't feel like I grasp it.

Still there is a certain something which me makes want to keep it in my collection.

An excellent game of push your luck. Really tough choices on when to bail out - do I just want more cards? Maybe I can get just one more palace? I really enjoy this game but I can never seem to back out when I should... so I'm pretty bad at it.

RATING: 9
I'm not so hot at this game, but I enjoy it anyway.  It's brinksmanship at its best, where you are constantly trying to make the most out of a minimal number of card plays.  Keeping yourself flexible is very important.  This game is amazing that manages to make it SEEM like going first is an advantage, but such is not always the case.  Really beautiful bits, probably the best that I've seen in a Euro game.  The colors are beautiful, the art is fantastic, and the whole comes out with a wonderfully cohesive look.  Lots to think about, and nice and tense.  One of Knizia's best.  My preferred way is to play where the white cards you get from the nobles are one-shots, not where you are able to take them back into your hand every time.  I find that otherwise the emphasis tends to be too heavy on yellow at all times.

Rating after two plays. 1st play was with 5 and it was cha-o-tic! 2nd game was with 4 and it was decidedly different. Both times the scoring rules were misread but the second time time was a little less so. This is an exciting game and I am looking forward to the next game.

Another Knizia game that clicks for me.   Really interesting choices within the game.  Didn't really focus on my long term plan as much as I should have in my first play - connections vs. the marketplace vs. more cards.  Anytime I get a chance to play this one - I'm in.

2nd play - tied for first with a more balanced approach, the elephants seem very powerful

3rd play - dominated with a different approach (+2 yellow bonus combined with winning regions 5,6 and 7 somehow)  Love it.

The main reason I play games is to feel the thrill of agonizing, nail-biting tension, and no other game takes me there quite as effectively as Taj Mahal. The Euro equivalent to Poker without the tedium of waiting to get a playable hand. The game is decidedly strategic, but knowing when to cut your losses or otherwise adjust when your best laid plans are interrupted is integral to success. Not an intuitive game and because of its harshness and the "all-or-nothing" nature of the auctions perhaps not for everyone, but for me it is a bundle of bliss packaged in 90 mins. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's hard to categorize this game, since it takes into account hand management principles, area control, and balancing your interests in certain commodities.  I like the blend of the mechanics, but the learning curve is pretty steep.  In my first game, I thought I was doing well for the first half of the game, and then watched everything swirl into oblivion.  In my second game, things started to click, and I was impressed with how balanced the game was, as well as with how varied my options were.  It's very important to know when to start, bail, or continue in a fight (and to hold onto cards in short suits for when you have to prevent another player from getting a lot of stuff for next to nothing), but it's also fun to trash talk the other players in a fight to see how many cards they can play from their hands.

在濃濃的地方美術下，讓我第一眼認定為簡單的遊戲性，喔不!
我還真是不了解RK，這款泰姬瑪哈陵可說是經典的爆腦、計算遊戲之ㄧ。

遊戲分為兩條主要得分路線:貨物流(收集大象)和蓋房流。
(在遊戲快結束的時候，還有收集同色牌的小加分方式。
遊戲就是你知我懂的比多寡。
輕策性的手牌管理，因為加分的方式不同，讓策略性更為提升。
出牌跟退場的時機，是這遊戲的最大重點。
如果您是渴望獲勝的，還得不時去猜想對手的套路，詳記每回合對手拿取的牌色，更別提還加了一點佔地先後順序的特性...
得分的計算上，還是不忘賞了玩家ㄧ個耳光，貨物種類累積、地域性累積，在這直白但變化高深的方式下，強制讓玩家們互相碰撞。

規則簡單，美術跟遊戲帶入感不足，但完全不重要 XD
可是非常吃人腦CPU，也很吃玩家之間的互動走向。
如果遇到思考魔人，或是重策王者，這款遊戲策略度瞬間爆表啊!!!

This has a fairly different-feeling combination of mechanics. Just enough randomness to increase the replay value, lots of interesting decisions, and multiple viable paths to victory.

This is a typical Knizia.  That is to say, it's an elegant math-based thinking exercise.  If you enjoy that sort of thing, this is a fine game.  If you need your games to have a soul or some sort of wow factor, you'll need to look elsewhere.

Don't underestimate the power of the province tiles, which means by extension that you need an elephant stash to draw on or else those sweet tiles will be divvied up by your opponents.

I know the rules, but I'm still baffled by the gameplay and don't have a good feel for what to do when. Luckily for me, everyone else in my neighborhood has just as much experience as I do, so we're learning it together.

RATING: 9
Played it twice. Got crushed both times! It were 5 player games. This game spells "TENSION". This game requires clever play, you have to 'feel' the moment when to play or pass. Well there are 2 players in my regular gaming group who ended in both games as nr. 1 and 2. In other words this game is top on strategy and tactic. I don't expect myself winning this game, still a lot to learn... but if I do maybe this game will be my second 10. One player in my group doesn't like the game. He feels he can't control it, but I know for shure that's not in the nature of the game but the player... Tadsh Mahal=Knizia on his best! 

Played for the 3rd time. This time I focussed on placing palaces on the right spots. This gave me lots of points the last 3/4 rounds. Nearly enough to win...the winner had 3 points more and played the 'elephant' strategy. 

We enjoy this game, there is a small line between chearing your victories and feeling frustrated! I'll keep my rating at 9.

Played it again, this game is a true gem! Fantastic game with great tension. One of those rare games where frustation feels good:). After each play, I think "next time it wil be my game". I should rate this a 10...

I'm still not certain how much control there is here, but even if there's not much, the illusion is powerful.  The decisions are always gut-wrenching, and the game does reward planning.

Played several times (mainly with 4 players). An archetypical game by Reiner Knizia, with tough decisions every turn and lots of ways to score points, among which you have to sacrifice a few (since you cannot reasonably compete in all provinces).

Auctioned it off before I gave it a fair shake - but I found the rules cumbersome and confusing. Even now, after playing it again with much more eurogaming experience, the gameplay strategies and planning is opaque -- I simply can't track all the information required to bid effectively against my opponents, and cannot evaluate different actions or rewards. It feels clumsy and herky jerky, though I admit that I can certainly see the appeal for folks who can mentally track several streams of info. [UPDATE] Re-acquired and given another chance. Still don't "get it" and still can't evaluate good plays versus bad plays. I can't track other people's motives or what they might have, and can never tell what I should be doing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I can see why some people like it, but here is one of many reasons I don't: if you lose a large bidding war, it may put you out of the game. If always avoid bidding wars, you are certainly not going to win. Your score in this game is going to depend on whether other people decide to contest with you, something over which you have very little control.

This is one of the favourites in my collection.  Very well balanced, and extremely tense. Downright punishing as you bid for your influence.  I truly love it.  I'd often thought that the biggest challenge in this game is knowing when to cut your losses and walk away.  That said, I recently won a five player game where at one point, another player and I went toe to toe on a single round until we each had 8 cards up!  Ridiculous that I was still able to win... but that's how it goes some time.

Its weird how I ignore some games sometimes... I'm guessing that happened to Taj Mahal during my "I don't like any auctions" phase.  Enough geekbuddies listed it as one of their top 3 Knizias so I finally got around to getting a copy to try. 

I enjoyed the game... though perhaps not as much as I hoped.  The card management is great... but it seemed really hard to build good chains on the board... and once everyone else realized how much easier it was to collect goods that got a lot harder too!  It definitely seems like this would improve with experience so I'm looking forward to playing it some more.

This game genuinely makes my head hurt, but I love it all the same. One of the most tense games I've ever played. Can become quite nasty.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not an easy game by any means.  I like the fact that you can't really have it "figure out" as there are different ways to attain VP.  Taj Mahal also encourages long term planning, and in that aspect it becomes fairly unforgiving if things do not go your way as the play progresses.  It seems that having to change your strategy on the fly is often a sure step to losing.

I don't really mind the set collection part nor the bluffing mechanic.  However, the play order often feels like it has too much significant impact to how each province is played out.  There is also the pain of the constant bookkeeping in the scoring as well as who has claims on each of the special cards.  Not to mention the repetitive nature of the rounds.

An interesting design to say the least.  This is a provisional rating for the moment, will require more exposure to actually nail down my enjoyment for the game.

RATING: 9
I can't seem to wrap my head around this game.  After half a dozen or so playings, I've only won once, and just barely at that.  This may be why I think this game is so great...because it takes effort and understanding to actually be good at it consistently. Update to a rating of 10: Taj has the "Blue Moon" factor that I love; do you keep investing to attempt to gain more, or are there diminishing returns to the additional investments.  Where is the cutoff point?  And the cool thing is that it's different for every player.  A masterpiece.  Update: Don't have as much desire to play this after not having played it for some time.  So it's bumped back down to a 9.  For now.

I do not like this game.  I am pretty surprised by this myself.  I have found, play after play, that the game just doesn't offer much.

After 2+ Plays: Reminds me of poker--you have to know when to fight for the prize, and when to cut your loses and get out.  If you like that type of game I suggest you try [GAMEID=112], which has a similar feel but, IMO, is much more fun.

After 10+ Plays: I still like [GAMEID=112] more, but I've grown to appreciate Taj Mahal more as well.  There are 3 main ways to gain points: connections, elephants, and the princess card, and I really like how each strategy is subtly affected by the number and proclivities of other players. Bumped rating from 7 to 8.

Great mechanics. What makes this game in my opinion is the poker element. Knowing when to fold is crucial. I've only knocked this down a couple of points since the luck element prevents a long term strategy. Very replayable and very addictive.

Very good tipical Knizia geme. It's a poker flavoured game that each turn request a different approach. The bid mechenic is exciting and there are different ways to reach the victory. Overall a very interesting game concept.

По правилам - какое-то старенькое евро с очень скучной тематикой. Не играл.

A game with exciting decisions to make. I only have a couple of plays, but the different ways of scoring points seem to be balanced. Dunno just the exact reason this is not one of my favorites.

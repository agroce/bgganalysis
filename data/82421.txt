I really don't like Magic Drain event and overall catch-up mechanisms seem a bit flawed (they encourage turtling/"non-playing" strategies) but hey - Summoner Wars started here (and GD vs CG) + these are still some of the strongest out of the box factions :)

Fantastic game that has easy to play rules but with depth strategy inside. Very cheap to buy and fun to play, maybe chess style game lovers will have the upper hand here.

The Phoenix Elves are an interesting faction to play, with their automatic hits and great, well rounded commons.

The Tundra Orks are pretty hard to play right I find.

Good couple of races.  Phoenix Elves are the ultimate "pinging" race, with the ability for their archers to shoot farther than most others.  Also many of their units and cards focus on not missing, or "100% to hit".  Good faction if dice are your enemy, like me.  Tundra Orcs are the beefs.  And have additionally have lots of ultra specials with luck die rolls.  They are actually a very lucky dice based faction (if you're just a lucky person).  Many of their units are cheap and tough.  Also they have the "freeze" ability card to lock down enemy summoners, very annoying.  Good mix of factions here.

Felt I had to try Summoner Wars. Had heard so many good things about this game that I felt 15 pounds was a great deal to give the game a try with a couple of factions. While initially it feels like there is quite a bit of luck in the game. It still feels like tactical, strategic play can win out. Especially when playing with a faction such as the Phoenix elves. I think Master Set would be an ideal next step with this game.

Summoner Wars represents a terrific game system. Two different game mechanics and experiences are streamlined - card management and tactical gaming - and improbably integrated. What comes about a result is a remarkably elegant result which is lots of fun to play. What I'm struck by mostly is the value of the game. The rules are ultra-simple and the time investment of a two player game is minimal (30 - 45 minutes) but you are rewarded so much for the minimal investments. The game is deeper than it looks and the different decks play more differently than one would think. While not a filler, Summoner Wars is a light game which is absolutely perfect when you have two geeks who may not on a given day have the time or energy for War of the Ring. It's a game that fills this sweet spot as no other does for me. Now that the Master Set is available, that really is the set to get, but the two player sets are where it all started. With the paper mats (better in the second editions) they're still great for travelling light.

[i](I own it... I'm just indicating otherwise for "extended stats" purposes.)[/i]

I own the Master set, so my rating is based on how much these two races add to the diversity of options. 

Admittedly, the Phoenix Elves and Tundra Orcs are pretty vanilla. You've got your generic light units with long range, and your generic big beefy units with poor range. That's pretty much it.

For me, the main reason to grab these decks is for teachability. Both decks are rather straightforward to play. I can see why these units were essentially the original option that they sold. But if you own the Master Set and are already familiar with the game, these are nice to have options but not essential.

I really liked the theme of both factions, but I feel that Tundra Orcs + Fury allows for a lucky player (5% of the time), to wreak so much havoc that it's difficult for his opponent to recover. This can be quite frustrating when the rest of the game is fairly balanced.

Phoenix Elves are pure destruction.  Direct damage is the name of the game and excellent ranged/movement capabilities to frustrate your opponents.  The Summoner is very fragile though and if you slip up once, the game can quickly end for you.

Tundra Orcs are a wild card.  Their berserkers can really do some damage if you keep rolling a certain way.  The ranged units can do some heavy damage or none at all, depending on the dice.  They do have some interesting tricks with their freeze events and ice walls which will make opponents be wary about how they approach you.

Summoner Wars is a delightful mesh of a traditional fantasy card game and chess, with ample strategy and just enough of a luck element to keep things interesting.  It's amazing that there are so many factions that all play quite differently from one another, and yet they're all mostly balanced.

Although I prefer the quirkiness of the Guild Dwarves and Cave Goblins as starter races, the Tundra Orcs and Phoenix Elves are probably better suited for new players, with each race utilizing relatively simple strategies that are nonetheless enjoyable to execute.

Feels like chess with powers. It sounded like something I would really like but it just fell flat. I'm not sure why either. Maybe it's the small text, or the mediocre artwork but it just didn't work for me. I'd rather just play chess.

You should probably start off by downloading the iPhone or Android app. You can play with Phoenix Elves for free in the app which is not in the master set.

If you like the app, you can buy Summoner Wars: Phoenix Elves vs Tundra Orcs first. I find these two clans to be easier to learn with for new players.

So far I have only played with the Tundra Orcs.  They're neat! Very powerful. They have multiple attacks, quite strong Champions and the ability to sprout Ice Walls which then can attack through the use of the Summoner. But they are so overpowered that they actually have issues with their magic and defense, making them at times easy targets for their opponent. They feel very nicely balance and create a good amount of tension when they are in the game, and their weaknesses make the opponent feel like they have a fighting chance. Good stuff here!

This was a surprisingly fun skirmish game. It's simple to play. It uses cards instead of minis, so it is very portable.

The art on the cards doesn't impress me....in fact I think it kind of sucks...but the gameplay is good enough that I can overlook it.

It's basically, move/attack or use a magic power. Cards work as a currency to use those powers. You're very limited in what you have available which adds some tension to your choices.

The paper map is CRAP-TACULAR!

Warriors are possibly the best common in the game. Quick strikes then retreat behind your own wall. A fantastic Summoner ability as well, but be careful as he is very vulnerable.

I don't really care for the TO. The Ice Walls are easy Magic for your opponent and unit abilities that are negative are never really fun. The added randomness is not something I enjoy, as the way the game plays out is even less in my control. I should play around with a custom deck more to see if I can find a combination of common units that I actually enjoy. Otherwise, go champion heavy with the TO.

Edit: this was improved somewhat by their reinforcements, but my prejudice remains.

Initial rating: 7.0 (October 2012)

Summoner Wars is not a bad game but I was expecting something a little better.  As of today the master set is ranked at 26 and the others (including this one) are also very well ranked.

The rules are really simple making it easy to teach and learn. The gameplay is also relatively short (easy to hit the table) and I DO like tactical combat games so I like this game. The art is ok but I expected a fantasy game to have better art. Recently I bought Mage Wars and although I have not played it, the art in that game is awesome. The art in Summoner Wars is not bad, but somehow, it doesn’t call to me, it EVEN has the opposite effect, it drives me away from the game (and that is the main reason I have not played this before now) I cannot explain why I don’t like the art, it’s something irrational and visceral.

The gameplay is good and although it has a lot of luck, it can be managed so almost always the player with the best tactics will win. I have only played it twice, but I expect to play this a lot more. What I really like is the Magic Points. That mechanic is great because it forces you to choose which cards in your hand you will sacrifice to summon you creatures. This is similar (for me) to how you pay for cards in Race for the Galaxy and allows for hard decisions. 

I really like that there are a lot of factions making each play very different from each other.

From my limited perspective, It seems the Tundra Orcs are way more powerful than the Phoenix Elves but I need to play more to form a better opinion about this.

I have enjoyed my plays of SW and I expect to play it more soon and who knows? Perhaps its rating will go up.

Current Rating: 7.0

What a surprise game I began playing it on the iPad. Now I have played more than 30 times and I really like it. I like it so much that I already bought everything that can be bought for the game (except for the dice). I still think the game art could be a lot better, also the cards can scratch (and mark) very easy so I sleeved them ASAP (although I sleeve every game that can be sleeved :D).

A game of Summoner Wars can take from 30 minutes to 1 hour and a half, I’m neutral about that although I would like my games to be under 1 hour. A huge plus is that the game can be taught under 5 minutes and the theme rocks. On the bad side I really dislike the paper map, it´s only advantage is the portability. As I bought the master set I always play in the mounted board and I’m thinking on buying one additional board so I can play 2 different games at the same time (making it easier to bring it to the table). For me this is a 2 player game, with 4 players the downtime can be high.

The Tundra Orcs are the most powerful faction IMO (and that includes all the factions I have played not just this set). The ability to move and attack twice if you roll a 5 or more is way too powerful and as I have very good luck, most games I use them I can do this many times. Playing with the Tundra Orcs is pretty easy as it is a “Brute Force” faction. 

The Phoenix Elves require much more finesse to play. I´m still developing my strategy with them, but so far I have lost the majority of games playing with them. Still I like them and I will play with them until I master them.

I haven’t yet explored the deck building and customization aspect of the game, but from what I read in the rules, it is very limited.

To wrap it up, Summoner Wars is a great, quick tactical game. I never say no to this so I`m upgrading its rating. I still prefer to play Mage Wars over this but as Mage Wars is a much heavier game, I don’t always find willing opponents to play with me.

After 40+ plays, the Tundra Orcs are still my favorite faction to play with. They are VERY strong and I almost always win when I play with them. They are a fairly straightforward faction to play with. My favorite units are:

- Grognark is very powerful with high HPs and attack, its ability is amazing as this faction has a lot of walls. 
- Krung can devastate lots of small units in a single attack.
- Fighter depends a lot on luck, but with him I have won matches in my second turn. The Fury ability can change the game in a single turn although you need some luck to pull it off. 

I usually don’t play with:

- Blagog is not bad, but his weakness (hit on 4+) has cost me some attacks, so I exchanged him for Rukar from the reinforcement pack. 
- Shaman, the unwielding Magic weakness is too harsh to overcome, I fail a lot of attacks, I exchanged the ones I could for Thwarters from the reinforcement pack.

I have found that the Sluggish weakness is not as bad as I thought.

I will now begin to play more with the Vanguards and the Filth as they are the factions that most caught my attention.

After 86 plays of this faction alone, I can say I’m a huge fan of the Summoner Wars universe. Now I want to explore every faction and with the second summoners packs and the Mercenaries, the deck building aspect has improved a lot. 

On 2009, they also released Summoner Wars: Guild Dwarves vs Cave Goblins but I chose Phoenix Elves vs Tundra Orcs as the best game of the year because: 1. I believe that it was released first 2. The Tundra Orcs are my favorite faction so far.

The Master Set also made my list of 2011 favorite games (as an honorable mention).
 
I will buy every card/faction they put out for the game. Summoner Wars have something I value in my favorite games, high replayability and high customization value. I really dig that you can add some cards and change how the game plays/feels with very little rules overhead. This is a recurring factor between some of my favorite games (Dungeon Twister, Dominion, Neuroshima and Rattus among others).

I expect to still be playing Summoner Wars for years to come.

I can see these were the starting factions. They are the most straightforward to play, and I can see myself needing to go back and play with these a lot more before diving into all the other factions. 

I don't really care about the theme, in fact I dislike it, but the game is convincing enough that I can appreciate the system and look forward to playing it more.

SW is a great game but the art is horrendous...
While I like the game and do want the master sets + expansions/ other armies, I probably will never play them. There simply are better 2p card duel games out there and I already have this small boxed set.

And... the bad art really cost the game at least one point :/

Best mechanic? The choice to whether or not you burn down your own deck in order to fuel your magic higher/ get to your champions quicker.

2014-02-13 - The best game I played so far. I think that it will stay in my top 10 forever, probably in top 5 as well.
I think that this is better starting set than Goblins vs Dwarves.

What was once a fertile land of unparalleled beauty was replaced by a wasteland of ice. Now the Phoenix Elves, trapped for millennia in their volcanic halls, have found a Summoning Stone and are ready to seek revenge for the destruction of the Summerlands. But in their way are the Tundra Orcs: frozen reavers with a Stone of their own, as well as plans for grisly conquest.

Nice simple 2 players gameplay with dynamic play and interesting strategy.  Still a good bit of luck involved, nice theme.  On the downside, if you want some diversity and replayability, you have to buy many of it, and it's not especially affordable.  Given the price, the paper play mat is a shame (and they charge $15 for a cardboard one, sold separatly).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting card combat game with special abilities. I will have to play this more to get a handle on why it is so beloved.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
* Components quality
- The cards are quite thin (compared to Magic: the Gathering), and not linen textured (compare to RftG).
- The paper board does not lay flat, but it is serviceable.  Not a real practical problem.
- Beautiful rule book.
- I find the art quite fine, even though I prefer the art of Race for the Galaxy.  I wish that event cards had individual art, though.
- For 20 €, quite decent components.  Can be compared to Scarab Lords, which is I find slightly better in terms of component quality (linen textured cards, (small) mounted board, lots of individual card art).  But I applaud the fact that a small company can release a game at such a reasonable price tag.

* Others
- Rules very easy to follow, nicely laid out.  The rules are simple to grasp, and the game flows well.  The turn summary cards are very useful.  However, the ability texts do raise a few questions.

* Game feel
- Really a miniature skirmish game with some hand management elements.
- Not so many special powers ("Events").  Nothing like Magic: the Gathering, which is arguably much more packed with surprises and variety.
- Movements without diagonals feel unrealistic, for a tactical combat.  Arrows that only fly vertically or horizontally do to.  I prefer skirmish games on hexagons (LotR: TMG), and line of sight.
- The fact that combats are not simultaneous does not feel realistic either: when a Unit of your is attacked, you cannot fight back immediately.  This is in contrast with a wargame such as C&C:A ("Battle Back") or a miniature skirmish game such as LotR: TMG.
- Common troops die very quickly.  Along with the fact that they are summoned progressively throughout the game, this makes battles less visual and memorable than when two large armies fight each other (contrary to LotR: TMG, for instance).  I have more of a "launch missiles from your Walls" feeling (as in a flight simulator) than of a "you're the general in command" feeling (which I do get with LotR: TMG, C&C:A, LotR: the Confrontation).
- Quite light.  However, the game becomes more and more interesting as I play, as I feel more and more in control.  You get to better know your deck, and the deck of your opponent; this gives you more control on the outcome of the game, which always feels great.  During the first 3 (+?) games, I progressively learned about the importance of Wall positioning (defense), fleeing, the summoning tempo,…  Dominion, Jambo, Samurai or Scarab Lords require more thinking, for me, and take about the same amount of time.
- My first 3 (+?) games developed quite differently each time.  This variety is enjoyable.  It also shows that you can learn from each game, at least at the beginning.
- The fact that the decks are small is nice: you know that you will/can get to see all the cards, which gives you more control.

* Summary
- A skirmish game "lite", without the realism of some miniature skirmish games (in terms of game mechanics), and without a feeling of two combating armies.
- Magic: the Gathering satisfies my special-powers itch much better.  This is not a criticism, though.
- A solid game.
- I appreciate that it comes from a small publisher, and I applaud the efforts put into it.

Best starter set for absolute beginners in SWs.

Not sure how I feel about 2P combat games like this and Mage Wars. Probably want to try before I buy, and even then...I suspect I'd like other games more first, but who knows...

Also try the small faction packs first, they are cheaper and will show whether you like the game.

Okay, tried this game on iPad. Its decent, about on par with MTG and probably better than YGH. I like how cards are used as your mana supply and you always draw up to 5 so its not as much topdecking. Theres still some luck of the draw and dice rolls, but for the most part, the game is tactical enough that a better player ought to win. I didnt like how much reading is necessary. Theres about 60 or more cards total in a game, give or take, and even with duplicates, beginners will have to read a lot to get it. I assume this would improve with more plays, but Im not big on this kind of tactical game with card play. I guess it felt thematic enough and made sense, but it just didnt wow me.

I ended up selling my copy of this. Though it was fun I really didn't find that much enjoyment after a few plays. It just seemed a bit dry.

I think I mainly didn't like how it often ended up with both players running out of cards and just chasing each other around the board until someone finally got a lucky shot in.

This is probably due to lack of experience with the game but I didn't really have a desire to dive deep into this one.

I can see how some like it but it's just not my kind of game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Oh yes. Yes yes. This just makes me all kinds of happy. It scratches that abstract army game itch, for which Neuroshima Hex! is my go-to game, but this feels far more like a battle.

The best thing about the game is it's scale. You don't have too many or too few options; there are just enough abilities that it's easy to keep it all in your head while keeping it varied; you have few units to worry about but the game state changes quickly; there are real decisions but also a lot of fairly obvious moves so you don't need an eternity weighing the pros and cons of each one; the dice, too, make it so you can't plan everything in advance, and yet movement and placement and using your units to their strengths are more important than being lucky.

It's a short game, but a lot happens, and a real story unfolds in very little time. A new wall on the right spot, an event that burns or freezes an important unit, a lucky die roll, a hard-hitting champion entering the battle; there's a lot that can swing the balance and make someone go aggressive or fall back, or switch the focus of the fighting.

Recommended!

One of the two small (original) starter sets for Summoner Wars. These are two interesting factions.

The Tundra Orcs are a push-your-luck faction. Their special abilities are all linked to the results of your dice rolls, which stimulates a good risk-reward strategy to deploying and fighting with your units.

The Phoenix Elves require a playstyle with a lot of finesse. On the one hand, they have very mobile units, and units that are guaranteed their hits.

Phoenix Elves have precise attacks that always do damage, and Warriors that can teleport back next to walls, so you mostly use warriors to take pot shots with your ranged units without exposing them.

I really liked how direct this game is. And easy to pick up, yet there are probably layers and layers of how to actually use an army well. I was surprised that the army is that simple - not a lot of different cards in a deck, but that works just fine. 

Otherwise I rank SW at 9.5, it's just that these two factions didn't grab me.

Much nice these factions (my favourite between the two are the Tundra Orcs)easy to integrate with factions of master set. 

If you hate too randomness in the game, the Phoenix Elves are the must; inteade, the Tundra Orcs are more "fortuitous" of normalt, but have the event cards much strong, especially if combined with the special ability of summoner.

It was depressing to being beaten by phoenix elves everytime we playes, but vanguards were right answer to Phoenix elves and now I feel confindent, that it would be possible with orcs too. Amazing game. Right playtime, neat gameplay, strong theme, great mechanics.  With expansions / factions it is my favourite game.

Two solid factions in this pack.  Strangely, I don't really like them matched up against each other since neither of their special abilities gets a chance to shine.  Both are unique in flavour and play style.

RATING: 8
I'll just say I'm not a big fan of the elves.  But the Tundra Orcs are one of my favorite armies in the game.  Great variety and fun to play with.  Terrific art.  I know that others enjoy the elves, so with that caveat, this is a must-buy set.  Logging my plays under main heading Summoner Wars.

Obtained all 16 factions in a short time. Overall experience is 7.8, but can see the Master Set being higher because it offers more value. Could see some expansions being an 8.0 while others maybe a 7.5.

Luck can play a huge factor in any game involving the Tundra Orcs.  If the dice are being kind to them, there's not much the Phoenix Elves can do other than make the best possible use of walls and manuever as carefully as they can.

Conversely, if the dice are hating on the Orcs, they've got to be even more aggressive than usual, and focus on getting to the Elven Prince irregardless of whatever losses they may take in the process.

Probably the easiest of the SW sets to start with as both Factions play pretty straitforward; the PE are a little better balanced to accomplish their style of attacking play.

RATING: 7
This is a pretty awesome game.  Rules are simple, but it's got lots of head to head combat.  I need more plays to flesh out my opinion but I do like the card management quite a bit.

Fast and slightly chaotic with luck coming in the form of dice and card draws.

This was my introduction to Summoner Wars, as suggested by a Youtube review on the grounds that it's a good trial set if you're not willing to commit to the Master Set. I found it lacking, and only gave the game another try with the Master Set after a veteran suggested that this was actually a very boring pair of factions. I agree with his assessment; the factions in the Master Set perform better than these ones, and you're better off finding someone to demo the Master Set to you than buying this stand-alone expansion to try it out.

Summoner Wars is my favorite board/card game of all time. It's easy to learn, teach, and play, and there's phenomenal depth there for anyone who wants to become a master. The luck element can be strong at times, but there are plenty of ways to mitigate it, and it ultimately only makes this wonderful game even more thrilling.

I've written about SW a few times, and will continue to do so in the future: http://spacebiff.com/tag/summoner-wars/

This set contains two of the most basic Summoner Wars factions, and is a good entry point into the series.

The PHOENIX ELVES are all about precision. Most of their troops aren't super tough, but they often dispose of chance entirely by making guaranteed hits, getting extra chances to attack, or darting away from combat to avoid retaliation. The downside is that their summoner, Prince Elien, is incredibly frail, and cannot afford to allow the enemy to get too close.

The TUNDRA ORCS embrace the opposite end of the spectrum. They take chances, rolling more dice and alternating between spectacular successes and spectacular failures. Their side of the board tends to be very foreboding, full of Ice Walls and tough defenders, and their ability to freeze enemy troops can be a game-changer if their enemy isn't prepared to sacrifice in order to counter it. This is a great faction for teaching beginners, as they have very few weaknesses.

Good, vaguely-CCG-like battle without the trauma of mana block or lots of fiddly exception cards. Dice odds make the battles very bloody but that also speeds the game along.

Ok, 1 play of this so far with another human and 2 with me playing both sides.

My girlfriend being my main vict- er playing partner I'm not sure about the game yet. She liked it ok but wasn't super into it playing the elves so we're gonna try again in a day or two with our roles reversed and see how she feels about it.

For me personally it's an amazing game.
UPDATE:
Played again using opposite factions and she enjoyed it A LOT more. We're definitely going to need to get the master set for this one

I haven't played enough of either faction to see how well balanced they might be, but I've had a blast just playing the game.  The design seems a little fiddly at first, but it comes together well, and has enough other stuff going on throughout the game to keep it from feeling like a Chess knockoff.  It's also rather addictive, which isn't a bad quality to have.  Not at all.

Another perfect starter set, with both armies playing wildly differently.  The Elves strength is surety--randomness is minimized as several units inflict guaranteed hits.  The Orcs, of course, are the opposite, with tons of randomly activated abilities that force you to harness good luck and mitigate bad as best as possible.

more decks and versatility never hurt. the tundra orcs bring mechanics reminiscent of the swamp orcs, but a bit less walls. 
The lack of walls really negates the summoners power whenever they go on offensive.

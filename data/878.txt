It's really just a rummy game thinly disguised with a Wild West theme.  This means you have to deal with luck of the draw as well.  That said, it works very well with 2-4 players, it's quick, easy, relatively cheap, and fairly fun to play.

Rummy type game with nice variables and the ability to nullify a meld or two from others hands. Great family fun!!! Still playing this one all the time. Can you say "Hideout!" 

Excellent light card game. And have card trays/holders handy since the cards are small.

Dammit Wyatt! Disappointed with the new version. 

1) The colors are not well defined and difficult to tell them apart. We are using the older outlaw boards.
2) The money is larger but thinner. Not as easy to handle as the smaller money. We are using the older, smaller money.
3) The cards are larger but they don't have a smooth finish to them. We are still using the newer cards.
4) Make something up about the box differences.

Just don't understand how established folk make the most awful mistakes with time and resources at disposal.

RATING: 7
Part of the Mystery Rummy series sort of. Almost the same game play as the Ripper version of MR but the fact that you don't get penalized for holding cards in your hand at the end of a hand changes your strategy just a bit. I also like that the rewards can accumulate from hand to hand. The Sheriff cards also have a little more variety than the Gavel cards in MR: JtR. I think I like this one just a bit more that Ripper MR except those little cards! Check my comments on MR: JtR for more comments.

One of the best 3-player games. I was surprised while listening an episode of Ludology where Mike Fitzgerald wondered why some people thought Wyatt Earp is better with 3-players than with 4-players. To me it seems obvious. In 3-player game the two leading players usually concentrates on beating on each other, and the third player can have a good chance of winning. In 4-player game the players usually start to play for the positions already earlier.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a good rummy game.  The game is easy to pick up except for the scoring money section.  The card play seems like Knizia's Vampires but the Sheriff cards and even the number of placement of Outlaw cards really add more strategy to the game than you would think!  The only thing I didn't like was the gang-banging ability of the game.  This kind of put a damper on things.

I found my fun and easy three-player game.  Wyatt Earp is one of those "rummy games" that's not rummy.  Players are ostensibly in the business of hunting down outlaws.  The more attention they give those outlaws the higher their reward.  Players get more money for contributing the most to an outlaws capture.

It's a fun card game that plays in about an hour.  It's all about set-collection with a fair amount of "screwage" to keep things lively.

Verwarring over de regels:
- Wanneer stopt een spelronde?  Als iemand zijn hand leegspeelt, of als de stapel op is?  In het eerste geval kan je zeer tactisch gaan spelen.
- Hoe wordt het geld verdeeld als er méér is dan één ronde uitdelen?  Beginnen we dan gewoon opnieuw?  (de eerste krijgt dan 2.000 of 1.000?  of blijft het geld liggen?)

Antwoorden geplukt uit forum:
Q:
1. If a player takes the last two card of the close deck, he may still can play his turn - correct?
2. If the answer to the first question is yes, and now he plays a sheriff card forcing to take another card from the deck, does this action ends the round?

A:
Absolutely!
The "exhaution" rule on page 5 explains that the player does NOT get his turn if there are LESS than two cards in the supply (and he chose to draw from the supply).
If a hand hasn't ended when the supply runs out for the second time, then you simply reshuffle the discards so that the player can draw the card he has been forced to draw by the Sheriff card.

Q:
How is reward money divvied at the end of a hand (2 player game) when:
a) Player #1 has 6 pts
b) Player #2 has 4 pts
and the Outlaw carries $4,000 in reward money?

A:
player #1 gets $2,000, then Player #2 gets $1,000 and then player #1 gets the last $1,000.


Remark 1:
Wyatt Earp cards can be played immediately to counter-act a Hideout card. This allows a defense against the play-a-Hideout-then-end-the-round gambit.

Remark 2:
End of a hand: A hand can end in one of three ways:
1.	When a player discards his last card.
2.	At the end of a turn when another player has no cards in hand (i.e., by use of a Most Wanted card or a Wyatt Earp card used in reaction to a Hideout card).
3.	When a player chooses to draw cards from the deck and there are less than two cards there and this is the second time the deck has been exhausted.  The player does not get to finish his turn.

It's just a rummy game, but it's a REALLY FUN rummy game! I'm not totally sure why I like this game so much. I think part of it is all of the interaction through the hideouts,Most Wanted's, Fastest Guns, etc. The decisions you make are not always easy. You need to disguise your hand a bit and figure out how to capture the outlaws you want while maximizing your rewards. But I think a lot of it is just how the theme is integrated. When someone gets a shot to pull off a stagecoach robbery, they go 'Pchew!' and make guns with their hands. When someone drops a photo card down on someone else's meld, they make a camera with their hands and go 'Ca-chik'. There's still a lot of luck with the cards since it's a rummy game. But the combination of interesting gameplay, theme, and a little luck to lighten it up make for a very fun game.

For full disclosure, I have not played a "complete" game of this one yet, we only played one full hand. I've always been a fan of rummy-style games, and I liked the first game in the Mystery Rummy series, so I hoped this might fit my taste. Sure enough it was indeed a good game design. I appreciated that the basic rules are fairly straightforward, but there is some interesting twists brought in by those sheriff cards. These can add some complexity to the game, but thankfully they are clearly explained in the text you find on each card. I am a bit afraid that the Hideout cards could be devastating to someone's game, which I don't like, but it feels like there are enough Wyatt Earp cards to counteract them. I can't say for sure if this game is going to become a favorite or not, but a few more full plays of the game and I think I might have a real winner on my hands. I especially like how the theme plays into the game mechanisms. Although, to be fair, it is a bit odd that you are playing cards to catch the criminals, and also playing cards that have them committing more crimes. Still the theme boosts it one notch higher, and makes me want to play this again soon.

This has quickly become quite a hit at our house.  Plays very well with two, and plays quickly.  Simple rummy-based game.  Nice light tactics and strategy.  It's relaxing.  The Wanted posters are great.

Good components.  The cards are thinner than I'd like, but they don't damage easily, and they shuffle just fine.  The rewards and wanted posters are on good  cardboard, but there is a tiny bit of flash from punching them out.

The theme is fun, too, which I think tends to be more important in a lighter game. "I say Billy the Kid robbed the bank! *flips over starred card* Well, he didn't, he's just a pansy!"

I enjoyed the game but it dragged at the end with 4 players as we ran out of outlaw cards that were needed for the sheriff cards.  Fun anyway.

RATING: 6
Enjoyable rummy variant.  Seems to encourage hanging onto sets until you can end the round in a big way.  This causes a lack of options (few melds on table) during play, increasing the importance of luck of the draw.  Typical house rule = photo cards can be played out of turn (and we make a camera sound) provided that there is a meld in play for the outlaw.

Although a rummy variant, the artwork and production create the atmosphere of the period. One of my favourite card games.

RATING: 8
I enjoy this game a lot, but we've found it very difficult to interest anyone else in it, so we've been limited to mostly 2-player games. Having finally played both a 3 and 4-player game, though, I can see why people say it works best with 3. With 3 players it is more challenging to do really well than in a 2-player game, but 4 players made for a frustratingly shorter draw deck and a little too much pot-splitting.

Having now played three of its sibling games (Mystery Rummy Ripper, Jekyll & Hyde and Capone), Wyatt Earp is still my favourite.

I like card games that concentrate on card management, and this one does not fit that category.  Generally, as soon as you get a card you can play, you play it.

This is the card game that's made me reconsider my hatred of card games.  Part of the Alea small box series, this is basically a variant on rummy with a robust, competitive press-your-luck scoring system.  Easy to play game after game of, and it can get pretty hot and heavy.  Plus, our copy is the original German version, so we get to enjoy the effects of the cultural wire-crossing.

Decent game, but I think a bit too complicated for what it is, and there are horrible rules problems (hard to learn from the rules, special card abilities poorly defined or hidden deep in the rulebook and not referenced on the cards). The ability of the Wyatt Earp card to retrieve a Sheriff card from the discard pile and play it immediately is also broken, we play you have to play it next turn. Still, a neat game, but not up to the rest of the alea line, and Royal Turf is much better.

This is a neat twist on the Mystery Rummy series.  I like that the cards you play don't directly score; you have to balance the value of your melds against a set limit (minimum of 8 capture points) and your opponents (you must be within 5 of the leader) in order to get a share of the reward.  That definitely affects the strategy of when to play melds, and when to play on other folks' melds.

We've played with 2.  The rules looks complicated for a little set collection game, but it is actually much simpler than the rule book makes it out to be.  Yes, it is similar to rummy, but the theme is nice and there are enough differences that you shouldn't feel ripped off.  This game is heavily luck dependent, so it can be frustrating if you're consistently unlucky.  The scoring system takes a bit to get used to.

I really enjoyed the few playings of this I have been able to work in.  I'm certainly interested in trying to find some of the other "mystery rummy" sets.  The only reason this doesn't see much action is due to the restricted number of players.  Also, I find it much more enjoyable with three or four than just with two.  This is a good way to interest those gamers who received their gaming education from the playing of classic card games.

RATING: 7
Nice 3 player Rummy/Canasta variant. I have played this with friends who are familiar with the classic melding games, and it has went over pretty well with them.

Earp is essentially just a gamey variation on the older titles, but somehow its theme shines through rather effectively. The normal outlaw card play is fairly innocuous on the surface, but actually significantly different from other games in this genre, as you need to not only get cards out of your hand, but put enough points on the table to stay at least within a few points of first place in a suit, otherwise you are not going to score anything for that suit, and you're probably giving points to the person who is in first.

Real excitement also occurs with the various sheriff cards, which can swing majorities in a big way...somewhat chaotic in that regard, but for a game of this depth (light, fun) it felt in-spirit, and the game never gets completely out of control.

Nothing I would want to play every week, but this is a good 3 player option. I like it.

RATING: 7
While at its root this is a rummy variant, it's got enough twists to really keep things interesting.  Laying down several cards of "evidence" against an outlaw makes the bounty for capturing him/her bigger.  Your goal is to try and have the most and keep that bounty all for yourself, but it might be easier to share it with another player.  Sheriff cards add twists like a big boost to the bounty, or maybe blocking another player's cards.

This took me a bit to wrap my brain around, but once we got going it was actually good and we discussed strategy quite a bit afterwards.  Worth checking out for sure!

Production: I find the card layout and art to be very functional and attractive; the wanted posters and money tiles add some extra gloss, but the money could be a bit nicer. I dislike the half-sized cards.

When we played the first round of this, we were about to bring it back to the store, it seemd so pointless.  However, this game comes into it's own in the second hand because certain outlaws become more valuable making the game have some real strategy to it.  I think this plays better with two or three.  With four, the outlaws tend to all be captured each round, getting rid of the build-up feature.

Maybe it's just me, but I felt that this game occupied an odd space - not random enough to fully 'let go' and enjoy the aleatory aspects, so I felt compelled to analyse the various possibilities, probabilites and such. Whilst a great player may be able to pull off that weighing of probabilities, for me it just ended in annoyance and irritation.

If there was more riding on the roll of a dice and it was more clearly random, I would probably be able to get more excited and just have fun. Alternatively, for me to enjoy the strategies, there would need to be more choices to make and more ways to affect others even with terrible cards. 

Next time, I think I'd ponder less.

I'm not a huge fan of Rummy, but this is a fun game.  I've mostly played 2 player, but I've played a couple of 3 player games and both configurations worked very well.  Some people are turned off by the luck of having to draw a 'shot' card to successfully play some of the Sheriff cards, but not me.  I think that mechanism fits in beautifully with the theme.  The theme is surprisingly vibrant for a card game. The last session of Wyatt Earp my wife and I played was 5 games in a row. It definitely has that "just one more game" feel.  This might actually be higher than a 8.

Split personality.  Is this strategic or luck driven?  I can't tell.  On one hand, timing is key.  On the other, the shooty cards are a toss up and drawing photos is huge.  Maybe I'd prefer it if all sheriff cards were automatic as this would certainly balance the photos.  There's a tangible rhythm and a tension that builds as someone is about to go out.  Seems clever but why contaminate it with coin tosses?  UPGRADE.  Huge boost with 2 players, I'll never play with more than that again!

The Wild West theme is fun, sometimes when you add cards to a set you have to flip over a card to see if you get a shot off or not.  It&#039;s fun to say &quot;P-twang!&quot; every time a successful shot is flipped over.

RATING: 7
Rummy variant with some special-power cards that may or may not give benefits (luck of the draw, partner!) like raising the value of a set or freezing someone else's meld out of the payout.  Fun, simple, and social, with a good theme.

The game is good. The only down side is that the parts are not as well designed as the Mystery Rummy games:  The cards are too small and are flimsy and it's hard to play in some places.

RATING: 7
The fourth in the "Mystery Rummy" series, albeit unofficially, and arguably one of the better ones. Players play the "law" in this wild west themed rummy game, out to catch the bad dudes. In a clever twist, melded bad dude cards throw reward money in the pot and players who've melded that dude get a slice of the pie. First to $25000 wins the game. The production values on this game are fantastic, however the cards are a bit small.

I don't understand why Rummy is such a popular game. It seems the winner is randomly determined by the luck of the draw. And it is SO frustrating to watch the player to your left discard a card you need only to watch it get buried forever. Then they take Rummy and create spinoff games of it with theme? The western theme of this one isn't too bad, but the game at its core is just Rummy.

Fun rummy variant -- think of it as Mystery Rummy: Jack the Ripper 2.0. It is a lot better for 3+ players than JtR is.

I do have two problems with the game though:

1) I think that this game is the textbook definition of "fiddly." Lots of little pieces. Small cards. Outlaw boards. Tiny money. Et cetera. This is not a game to play outdoors where there is a stiff breeze.

2) What's with way too big box? Could you make it any bigger?

This should be considered a part of the Mystery Rummy series.  Unfortunately I think I've played the best game in the series before this one.  The best thing about this one is that I believe it's the best of the series when you have exactly three people.  Here are the things that bother me: scoring is fiddly, I hate the size of the cards (they should have been Race for the Galaxy sized), and the 'shot' mechanism is a little random.  In the end it's another mystery rummy game which is good and now I have one that plays well with three but it's certainly not the best in the series.

TRADED IT! (for Lewis and Clark Discoveries)

This is a very solid little Rummy style game that works well with 2. It is nothing remarkable, but the clean presentation, workable box size/insert, and cool flavor take it a step up. I just only traded it since my other half was not a big fan.

RATING: 7
[5 plays] Jolly good fun.  A Mystery Rummy-esque game that can be played with more people, though also good with 2.  This has the quality components and interesting historical flavor that are characteristic of the MR series.  
I like the use of the money tokens in this game, and how it eliminates the need for paper-and-pencil scorekeeping, which one has to do in the other MR games.  
The player aids are a very nice touch, but they do have one common flaw.  Sometimes the instructions printed on a card or on a player aid appear to say one thing, or appear to fully explain something, but really they don't because there's not enough room.  You can look at the card/aid and think you know what's going on, but then when you look in the rulebook, you realize that maybe it's the total opposite of how you interpreted it, or else there's just more to it than you realized.  I guess this is an argument for always reading the actual rulebook!

Western themed rummy game in the Mystery Rummy series.  Excellent theme and components, and fun casual game play, especially good with 3 players.

Note the [thread=1216091]rule change[/thread] in the new Gryphon Games edition: the [thread=411738]Photo card variant[/thread] has now been made the official rule (i.e a Photo card may be played out of turn once the first set of cards is melded for the matching outlaw).  This was the designer's originally preferred rule, that was changed by Alea in the first edition.

My personal favorite of the "Mystery Rummies."  Bounty payouts grow for the renegade clans, and the drawing for a successful shot raises the fun & excitement.  There's some interesting decisions when melding - as certain gangs (and players) may not score if the minimum points aren't reached.  Grade: C+

RATING: 8
Update:  Lowering 8 to 7.  I like other Mystery Rummy games better by now.  The 'take that' cards like Hideout make it feel less strategic to me.  Other games in the series like Jack the Ripper feel tighter and less busy.  The money is fiddly as well, it's a bit complicated for a simple card game.


This is a fun and relaxing game to play.  I'm a fan of the Mystery Rummy games that I've tried so far and would like to get more.  Wyatt Earp is my favorite- once I got the rules down.  Somehow the text on the cards confused me and it took a few plays to realize how simple and smooth the game is.  Rather than tension and decision pressure, this game is a comfortable and relaxing 45 minutes of entertainment.  The hands go quickly and you're always getting new cards to look at.  Luck of the draw and an occasional 'gotcha' card keep it lively.  Nothing too deep, but lots of fun!  This is my family favorite at the moment.  I wasn't happy that the cards are not quite full sized but I quickly got used to it.  However the card stock and other bits are great.  I even like the mini cardboard money, it beats keeping score with pen and paper.  Hopefully Mike Fitzgerald will keep working and turn some other traditional card games into something as fun as the Mystery Rummy series!

It's nice to have a Richard Borg game that doesn't involve dice rolling and infantry slaughter fests.  In fact, Wyatt Earp is a real neat-o card game that has a rummy feel to it, but the theme and mechanics that have been worked into it are really top notch!  The 2- and 4-player games go on a bit longer than it should, so I feel 3 players is the sweet spot.  The idea of building sets of Outlaw cards, adding more reward money to them by playing certain "crime" cards and then reaping them in with Sheriffs is such a great theme, and amazingly worked into this rummy-type card game.  The bits and cards are nicely styled and you can get into this game easily, though the scoring is a bit thick for first-time players.  A good dose of luck with which cards you draw but I don't feel it ruins the game.  Unfortunately, if you are far behind, you can see your loss long before the game is over.  But overall, quite an enjoyable card game and one I would pull out and teach to anybody.

Wyatt Earp is the best lighthearted card game for three players in my collection.  The Wild West theme is integrated beautifully to a degree that I wouldn't have thought possible for a simple card game such as rummy.  I especially like the way that outlaws build greater reward purses the longer they go uncaptured, bringing a slightly different focus to each hand.

The game is shot through with luck, especially the bullet hole mechanism (ha!) which adds another whole layer of uncertainty beyond the cards drawn.  You get drama at the expense of control.  That can be good or bad depending on who you ask.  If you ask me, it's good in this case, since we're discussing a Wild West rummy game and not an exacting battle of wits.  But even with all the chaos, there are still enough interesting decisions in a game of Wyatt Earp to satisfy the more thoughtful part of my psyche.

I have only played it 2-player, and as such in my opinion it doesn't really work. I'd be willing to try with more, but so far all I've seen is more luck and fewer choices than plaid old Rummy. And those Hideout cards suck.

My wife and I are both new-ish to designer gaming and card games even more so. I've never played rummy games really at all before and this one knocked us out. We had to buy it. I love the art (Vohwinkel is the best) and the game play is fantastic. Absolutely worth every penny. Update: I'm changing this one to a 10, it's just that great. It really plays best with 3 though.

One of my old favorites.  One of the first games (besides Monopoly or Clue type games) that I bought.  My copy was played so often that we almost wore out the cards.  They became extremely bendy in the middle with little crease marks that almost look like they are part of the pattern of the cards.  I put them in card protectors to prolong the life of the game, AND bought another copy to replace it when those didn't work anymore.  Luckily several copies exist in my gaming crowd now.

While I am not a big fan of the Mystery Rummy series of games (enjoyed playing most of them once, but don't feel the need to play again), and this game has similar mechainics, I enjoy this game. The slightly different mechanics are better than the other rummy games, and the flavor is just great. Good family game.

A themed rummy game. Didn't catch my fancy. Maybe because I grew up playing rummy? Dunno.

Played again recently: I think I do not like rummy games very much. The fact that casual game players don't know the card distributions in this game feels like it destroys what strategy rummy normally has.

I love this game! Fast-paced, easy to learn and most important: fun, fun, fun! It's a shame that the quality of the cards wears off quite fast but it may be a sign for how often this one lands on the table! Great "Abhänger" as we say in German which means it's a great game for the end of a  gaming session. I feel it plays best with 3 people.

#1 in the Alea small box series. Good card game with a western theme. Rummy style play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fairly long for a card game. You are also at the mercy of the card draws, especially your initial hands. Many of the 'take that' spoiler cards are dependent on a random card draw for success also and these, especially the Hideouts can be crucial. But still a lot of fun and plenty of decisions. Worked well with three.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quite good, really, even if it reminded of standard trick-taking type games like Mystery Rummy.  The art is very well done, the rules simple enough, and the interaction for larger groups superb.  A keeper.  Then again, I'm partial to Alea's stuff.

RATING: 10
Sometimes it's nice to play a light and quick game.  Wyatt Earp is just such a game.  It's easy to learn and yet, there is still enough to the game, along with some nice player interaction and gotcha moments, to make it fun.  This is a great family game and even my mom loves it too.  Wyatt Earp is the perfect light three player game.

For reasons outlined below I think this game requires 3 or 4 players to get the most out of it.

Our 2 player games are almost always 2 hand long.  Our play has become stylized, rarely discarding Outlaw cards and holding off melding as long as possible. Wyatt Earp cards are the most sort after Sheriff cards (to draw 2 more cards). Photo cards are next most popular, as a quick way to get 10 CP (which is usually enough for a clean sweep) or a way to catch up as the 'other' player. Most Wanted are a poor substitute for a Wyatt Earp, otherwise Sheriff cards are used as discards.

This is an ok rummy type of game.  It can be fun every once in a while.  I suppose I'm not so much of a rummy player.  There is some strategy and luck in the game.  The theme helps it as well.  It's a fairly short game less than an hour and pretty light.  Having said that, it's still fun and worth a play or two.

Wyatt Earp is a decent Rummy variant much akin to the Mystery Rummy series.  The one play sherriff, gavel-type cards often decide a players' effectiveness upon the initial draw as one can be sunk with too many.  The "shooting" mechanic is also a bit of a let down, but I've already started thinking up variants to help it (Last place player gets a bullet that instantly lets them pass one "shoot" check or play two sherriff cards, etc. during the current round).  The production quality is great, but the gameplay is less elegant than, say, Jack the Ripper and too random for two to enjoy.

RATING: 5.9
Jul07: C'mon, it's a nicely themed rummy.  Actually, it's a very nicely themed rummy.  The shooting mechanic doesn't bother me any.

If you're considering the "mystery rummy series," take the plunge.  Regular rummy isn't a bad game; add a cute theme and some thematic play options and you've got a great game.  (Ticket to Ride fits this argument too.)

Jul08: Just got Jack the Ripper.  Jack just ripped up this game.  Such a more interesting game.  Still, I'll probably keep Wyatt around for the cowboy lovers.

I agree with many of the other comments on BGG; good quality components (although the cards are too small) and great theme add interest to this traditional-style card game with a twist. However, the luck factor is too high for it to be a serious game, while it can be too lengthy and is a little too complex (all those sheriff cards) to play well as a light filler game.

While I love traditional card games, I'm not a rummy fan; but I like this a lot. I like the way varying $ rewards create a different set of incentives each game, especially how they carry over between hands.  I like the neat way the reward is divided, with a little "press your luck" where you can end up with nothing.  The game has enough subtle nuances to make it better than you'd think, e.g. the "bullet" cards necessary for certain powerful bonus cards get rarer as play continues since they've been melded. (Can anyone tell me why I love WE but hate the almost equivalent 2p Jack the Ripper? The theme fits better imho.)

For me I like all the card stock money and the sheriff cards. But you need space for this game. No playing on a plane with this rummy game :)

* Kickstarted! *

Fairly easy to learn: you draw either two cards from the deck or the last discard, play a set of coloured cards and/or a sheriff card, then discard one card -- triggering rewards if your hand is empty, at which point it's most points per wanted man winning/sharing the pot. Once you get the hang of it, it plays quick. My one big complaint with it is that the colours of the criminals are a bit too close, making it not so fast to pick out some compared to the others.

PLUS: quick to learn, good for all ages, decent replay value
MINUS: colours are too close

How can rules of such a simple game be so confusing? I had to read them twice and still had problems to explain them to my group. To add to the mixed impressions, I didn't enjoy the following game as much as I was expecting by the good feedback this game gets here - no control, high luck factor and three out of four people within one point at the end. From comments here, I see the slight chance that it gets better with only three players as there's more strategy in NOT playing certain cards to avoid that outlaws are scored.

I'm not really fond of the Western theme, but it's not obtrusive or offputting.  I like the artwork in general and the game is pretty relaxing to play.  I've only played with 4, and I can see how it would be better with three players.  I found that with 4, there's too much competition for outlaw cards, and after a certain point, after the Wyatt Earp cards come out, the draw deck is so depleted that it's difficult to add any more outlaws to your melds since there aren't an abundance left to be drawn.  Also, this game has a very unsatisfying tie-breaking rule.

Basic but solid game play. Has all the gamer "Holy Grail" elements: Works for 2 Player, Easy to teach, Works for playing with wives and parents, children can play yet serious adult games can be performed. This is now our group's official 'in-between' game. Everybody went out and bought their own copy after we played it the first time.  One of the best 'card game meets adventure theme' hybrids. Plus the world can always use more western themed games!

Love it. The theme plays well. 

I like the SEMI-COOPERATIVE aspect to "capturing the bandits"; the tiny money is fun; and there is a random element to the action cards in which you have to make a successful shot by revealing a card with a bullet hole (drawn) on it. It FEELS INTERACTIVE WITH MULTIPLE PLAYERS AND MOVES ALONG QUICKLY enough.

slightly more complex that most family games but not much. Sometimes the the simplicity is welcomed and it's just fun to relax with an intriguing interactive mechanic.

I have found that the Mystery Rummy series of games are really hit or miss, and the swing wildly. Jack the Ripper is one of the best two player card games I have ever played, but on the opposite end of that Jekyll & Hyde was just a dud from the start. When a recommendation program said that I should check this out I kind shrugged and figured it was because of my high rating for Jack the Ripper. The more I looked into the more I realized this one was something different. It looked a step up from Jack the Ripper, with the ability to play more than just two. After giving a try I can say that this is another great title in the Mystery Rummy series. The game is definitely best with 3-4, but is certainly some fun with just 2. The mechanics will be familiar to anyone who has played one of Mike Fitzgerald's Mystery Rummy games, but as always he finds interesting ways to twist the mechanics to make for something all together different than the other titles. The competition here is for outlaws, but with a number of Sheriff cards in the deck that do various things the competition will quickly heat up on the table for those outlaws. Overall I would say this definitely my second favorite Mystery Rummy game, right behind good old Jack the Ripper.

Have never liked this, it just doesn't do it for me.

Which seems odd since I enjoy the Mystery Rummy games.

[2009-11] However... have recently realized that we played this in the past with too many players (it wasn't me who read the rules!). Currently itching to give this another go, picked it up again recently.

[2012-08] Forgot to raise my rating. Set to a 7 for now, this one was a ton of fun over a bunch of 2 player games (and probably 3 or 4 players also, can't remember).

Very much like Mystery Rummy, but with a pretty good theme tacked on.  The cards and other pieces are good depictions of outlaw wanted posters, and of good quality.  As for the game itself, it's pretty good.  I like it enough to want a copy, but it's pretty far down on the list of 'to-buy-next.'

2-4p, 60m.
With fewer people, it goes faster than the 60 minute estimate on the box, since the reward money gets divied up fewer ways.  The small cards have nice sharp line art (sepia toned engraving style), and a nice, smooth feel.
Played a few times, but no one seemed to clamor for repeats, so I eventually traded it away.

I might rate it higher, but I had some extremely bad luck which makes me dislike that element of the game.  I managed to draw six of seven "Wyatt Earp" cards in one hand.  That severly hurt my ability to play cards and control when the round ended.  Luck can ruin this game for you.

I dig it. But it isn't seeing  play.

I think the biggest problem is when a person avoids playing much of anything till they can play out... but that's part of the game. May be able to minimize this through proper play or rules.. I guess it's just 'a thing that happens' in Rummy games
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Extremely swingy! I wish that I would have been told how swingy this game was before I played it. To be sure, I enjoyed the game quite a bit. It's a lot of fun, quick, light (while also being a bit crunchy) and fairly thematic. The production quality on the newest edition (Gryphon Games) is impressive, to say the least. These are some of the thickest stock cards I've seen since I last played Fleet, which is incidentally another Gryphon production. Wyatt Earp is an excellent 2 player game, even better than I expected. Just be warned--the game has quite of bit of randomness and you may see huge swings in the lead from round to round.

RATING: 7
Played 5-10 times. A light game with some randomness. There are quite a few different cards, but this was before gamers were required to learn a lot of icons, and all the information you need is in text on the cards and on a reference card. A successful Hideout can make a big difference, but overall I think the amount of luck is just about right for this kind of game. You may feel after two rounds that you are done with it, but it will probably take three rounds for someone to reach the 25,000 needed to win. All in all, I enjoy the ride.

This is a wonderful little card game for a competitive-minded gaming group.  We've had to change the capture limit from 8 to 10 in order to satisfy our gaming desires, but there's so much strategic player interaction in this game that it never gets old.  At the beginning, everyone is playing for themselves, but as the rounds pass and one player takes a sizable lead, the others must work together to prevent his/her assured victory.  Meanwhile, there are so many timing decisions to make based on the playing habits of your opponents, the cards you've drawn, the types of cards remaining in the decks, and the impending end to the round.  We've had an enormous amount of fun with this one, and with the right gaming group, I can't imagine I'll ever get tired of it.  This is easily one of my favorite games of all time.

It will take a hand or two to get into the swing of things, but it's not difficult at all.  The rules are written OK, but it sure makes the scoring appear to be more complicated than it actually is.

Not sure about this game -- I was expecting something akin to 'bang', but there is no theme at all and instead I got something more like TtR where set-collection is the key to winning. Plays fast and relax, and there is a good amount of tension in trying to figure out which card to discard. However the overall feel was pretty random, and I couldn't quite grasp what strategies someone might employ to win. I'd definitely play again, but I didn't like it enough to purchase it.

RATING: 7
Collect sets of cards to catch wild west bandits for most reward money.

Plays: More than a dozen?
Type: VP race = a game where you race to collect victory points (fastest/most).
Complexity: Family games = games that are easy to teach and play.
# of players: 3.
Playing time: 45 mins.
Player interaction: Competition for scarce resources - rewards. Q&A - some cards let you ask other players for cards. Targeting - some cards target specific players.
Randomness: Low - card draw, but you have some control over it.

Replayability: High, often everyone wants to play again immediately.
Fun: Yes, catching bandits is fun, and it's more interactive than most games at this level. Good family fun. 
Memorability: Not so high.

Thematic integration: Good.
Components: Nice.

Who will like this: Family gamers.

This really felt like a return to form for Mike Fitzgerald's Mystery Rummy series. I really dig the way you are playing outlaw cards with robbery and notoriety cards to grow their bounties. The whole game just feels really thematic, and I think it was a good idea to expand beyond the confines of a mystery theme for this series. The wild west works really well, and I like that this game actually includes a way to track points in the form of money for bounties. 

The way bounties are split up is very cool also. If you can dominate an outlaw enough, you'll get the whole bounty for yourself. If it's fairly close though, you have to split it up semi-evenly. This encourages having a large spread between what cards you and your opponent(s) have, and I really like this aspect.

Best of all, I think this puts the final nail in the coffin for me when it comes to Escape From Alcatraz. EFA is the one Mystery Rummy game that seems to work better with more players, despite the fact that I thought it was pretty bland, but Wyatt Earp also seems to support a wide variety of player counts. Not to mention the scoring is pretty similar. In fact, Wyatt Earp probably scales the best of all the Mystery Rummy games, and feels the most balanced overall when it comes to scoring. Really, my only complaints here are the same ones I share with a lot of Eagle-Gryphon small box games, and those are that the box is too big for the game, too tight to open easily, and the components are a little too big for the table space this game warrants.

Despite those minor niggles, this is just a really solid game. I still think Jack the Ripper is the best of the series, and I like Al Capone a little bit better for its simplicity, but this is a very close 3rd in the series for me.

RATING: 7.5
I like Wyatt Earp. I probably liked it a bit more when I first played it but as players increase in skill... luck plays a larger part in the eventual winner as a string of good or bad cards can go a long way in sealing your fate. I like the game though and it's one we've had good luck with in playing with the family. A good game to teach to children as it has just enough strategy and tactics to get them up to the next level of Euro gaming.

I really enjoy these games and feel this one can be included in the larger "mystery rummy" family.  I break these out with my less gamer-ly friends and family as I think it's less intimidating than a board game, but this one has more going on than the others in the series with the seven outlaw boards and money to keep track of.  As such, Jack the Ripper and Escape from Alcatraz do better in that regard and I'm more able to sneak them in and get them played.

When played with 2, this game is flawed. Not playing cards until you can go out is the only viable strategy. It gives you maximum control with very little risk - unfortunately, the then game devolves mostly into luck of the draw.

RATING: 7
Not sure why Wyatt Earp wasn't titled 'Mystery Rummy: Wild West', as that is exactly what it feels like. Wyatt Earp would have been a stand-out in the series, as it plays with up to 4 people.

I've played Mystery Rummies 2, 3, and 4, and I prefer Wyatt Earp to all of them as the inclusion of a money component improves scoring and the bounty mechanism is thematic. Both of these things also take the game a step away from being 'just Rummy with a pasted-on theme'.

My only complaint about the game is when the draw deck runs out for the first time, the game continues with the discard pile being reshuffled to create a new draw deck. During the playthrough of this second draw deck Sheriff cards are mostly useless as the possibility of successful Shot is reduced to almost nothing.

Mystery rummy. It's good to have photographs since you can use them on other people's turns and not have to use your sheriff action. How you cash in is highly dependent on your cards. If you have alot of sets, the best thing is to try and get 8 points in as many as you can and go out quickly. If you have more sheriff cards, you can try to jump in on as many warrants as you can. With bank robberies or fastest gun, this shouldn't be too hard to do.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I can't believe it's been a year since I played Wyatt Earp and that I haven't played it since. This is still the only rummy style game I played by Mike Fitzgerald and I enjoyed it and would like to play again especially if I had the chance to introduce it to my kids. I think my rating of this game will go up if I play it more since my only play was with two and I don't think that is the ideal player count for this game, I could see it being much better with at least three if not four.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I had a lot of fun playing this, definitely feels like rummy with a few player powers. I especially liked the addition of adding money to the wanted posters which you will then collect during the scoring phase depending on the melds you have versus just playing melds in front of you for points. I also really enjoyed the theme, this was a very pleasant surprise.

I am looking forward to playing this again, I would definitely like to try it with more than 2 to see how it changes the game. However; if I was going to add a Mike Fitzgerald card game to my collection I think I would go with [thing=151022][/thing].[/i]

RATING: 7
I have been eager to play this game and see how it stacks up to Mystery Rummy: Jack the Ripper, with which it is sometimes compared.  While I enjoyed Wyatt Earp and would be willing to play it again, I still prefer Jack the Ripper.  There are lots of similarities in the two as far as play goes, but in my opinion, Jack the Ripper generates more suspense.  The reward money for apprehending the outlaws, is a nice touch in Wyatt Earp, but also slows the game down a bit as players have to remember to up the ante when warranted, and then work out who gets what at the end of each hand.  The components are attractive and the old West theme is well-developed.  I also appreciate the inclusion of a female outlaw (Belle Starr) among the miscreants. (3+4)

RATING: 7
My rating of 7 comes after just one play, solo, to get the rules and game play (12-10-10), I can see why this is generally highly thought of. To me it gives some feel to the theme while making Rummy interesting. Well done. 


Purchased new, November 2010. Sold, July 2013, simply because I was certain I wasn't going to get my family interested in playing it. But for those who like rummy yet feel they'd like a fresh approach, this might do the trick.

What a delightful little card game! Having never played gin rummy, Wyatt Earp is quickly becoming one of my favorite quick card games to bring to game days. The main mechanics are set collection and "betting"; playing cards to "capture"/score outlaws, negating someone else's points or adding to the "reward"/pot for a particular outlaw. While I may not be crazy about the theme (Wild West just bores me), the game plays fast and the strategy runs deep. Wyatt Earp is a great in-between game or perfect for a whole night of 4-player card games.

RATING: 7
Arguably the best of the author's rummy games, particularly for 3 players where it's best. There's a huge luck element, but it's a great theme and the "shootout" attempts to do special actions provide drama and fun. It's slower than standard rummy as people try to sort out what's the best play with their sheriff cards, which bogs the 4 player version down a tad too much, but the sheriff cards add all the fun so it's a trade-off. Repeat play has shown that there's too much disadvantage in not getting stuff out as soon as you can so that people can help build your start meld into a scoring meld. Meaning it's usually too risky to try and go out in one fell swoop. Meaning the game usually simply comes down to who gets lucky with the cards each round, and feels simply progressive rather than daring. Still, very playable in a time-filler kind of way.

Light game of increasing the ransom amounts. The western theme is definitely plus for there aren't too many western games.

Beneath the surface it's only a game about making sets and collecting the profit (if any). The action cards can be mean, and the luck-based system on some of them adds nice amount of surprisement.
Works really well with 2 players, perhaps even better than with multiple.

Wyatt Earp is, and I'm not saying anything new here, a variation on the classic card game 'rummy'.  You collect sets of cards (in this case, each set corresponds to a particular villain), and then try to increase the value of the set by playing additional cards (sheriff cards). Basically, if your set is the most valuable of all the players, you get the lion's share of the reward.  That's it in a nutshell.  I'm a fan of basic card games, and I like the variation on rummy that WE presents.  The theme does a good job of tieing 'rummy' in with 'wild west', and provides players with a different type of backdrop the to normal themes (like space, pirates, ninjas, space pirates, pirate ninjas, and ninjas in space).  It plays quick and is worth the $30 you would spend on it.. gotta like cards, though, and you ought to like 'rummy' type (set collection) games.

Similar to the Mystery Rummy line of games (same system, designer overlap). A few interesting additions to the standard game of Rummy. Easy to teach and play.

WARNING: Doesn't play quite as well with only 2 players - best with 3.

WARNING: Cards are a bit on the small side and a little flimsy. They are far too small for even Yu-Gi-Oh sized sleeves too, so are likely to get a lot of wear given the amount of shuffling involved during play.

As with Hick Hack I love the build up of the bounty of points on the outlaws and pulling off the play to gain all of it. Yet here, determining who gets what is alittle long winded and confusing for first time players. I like the way that the "take that" plays are mediated by drawing the required bullethole card which employs a speculative tactic and the focus of frustrating fun. I prefer to play with 2 as with more each game on the table looks samey,and besides compounds the payout procedure and "draw then play" mechanic which slows game pacing.

Update: 7 years on since it's first release I can't think of any game that encapsulates what the wild west was all about as well as this game.

Mike Fitzgerald's rummy hands are all over this design... in a good way, that is. Light and quick, although most of the special ability cards felt underpowered: all were discarded except for Fastest Gun and the eponymous one. Over in two rounds: quick on the draw.

Take rummy - a horrible game - and add cards that have a shooting mechanic that require a successful shot by turning over a card and hoping it has a bullet hole on it, then add take-that cards, and you have a chaotic game with little or no strategy involved.  A 3 is a generous rating, given to compensate for my hatred of rummy-like games.

The game does sound way more complicated that it. It is pretty much a rummy-style game with players trying to collect the most cards of a specific outlaw as possible in order to reek in the biggest awards. The game is spiced up with action cards than can both hurt other players and benefit yourself but can also go wrong. The theme is nice and better than just using generic suits etc. Still, the game can be a bit daunting at times, but it becomes clear once you start playing a few hands. Might be a tad too long for what it is but I suppose you can't just lower the winning VP threshold. There might be a lot of luck involved in the card drawing too, which I don't mind but hardcore card game purist might find that not very amusing.

I never really knew what to make of this and ultimately it didn't come off the shelf nearly as often as a game of its weight should in my book. It's a cool rummy game, but do I want a rummy game?

It's a fun little card game where you're trying not just to get rid of your cards first, but also to engineer taking more from the reward piles than your opponents. Partly luck and partly timing and observation, the game is fairly harmless and the rules easy to remember even if you haven't played in a while. I really am tempted to rate it higher because it's so elegant in its simplicity, but the luck of the cards element holds me back. It's not that I mind the luck in such a little game, it's more the feeling that the game plays itself to a certain extent. That said, I'd be happy to own a copy because it makes such a good long closer for an evening every once in a while.

Of all the rummy games of this type that I have played, I think I might like this one the best.

Rummy with balls! i.e. there's some take that in the gameplay. Just is a very fun version of the cardgame with the theme and the sherrif cards. And because it is based on a well known cardgame the learning time is quick. Definitely fills a niche in my collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Wyatt Earp is essentially rummy with a shareholding element and an added dose of luck in the form of Sheriff cards which require a 'successful shot' to succeed. Despite being a light game, there are a number of rules to digest concerning scoring and using Sheriff cards. Once you get a round in though, the rest of the game plays quickly and intuitively.

The shareholding element lends itself to some welcome player interaction – nothing says 'screw you' quite like a Hideout card which manages to stick around. A good 30-minute filler, but never let your group convince you into playing this for 2 hours straight like mine did!

RATING: 8
[12 plays] - as 2,3, and 4 player games.This is a fun game that will be enjoyed by most people. It has a big luck element, but a person just has to recognize that going in and adjust his attitude accordingly.

What I like: nice artwork, old west theme, good component quality, quick learning curve, mechanism of increasing bounties, rapid pace of play.

What I don't like: Only one thing - a minor aggravation. Sheriff cards determining the success of their "shot" by hopefully revealing an outlaw from the draw pile seemed like a stilted mechanic at first. I am now used to it, but it can be slightly frustrating to see the card of which you have desperately been deprived suddenly revealed and immediately buried through this process. Not really too big of a deal, though.

What people need to know: It is not too deep and luck may play a big role, but just have fun, get into the theme. This is a really good rummy style game.

Most recent play 11-26-09 with Steve Robbins, Garrett, and Barb.

There is much here to like, the theme is cool, the mechanics do match it well.  It is a fun game.  But that damnable bullet hole mechanic just irks me.  When I play a card, I want it to do approximately the same thing each time.  With this mechanism, it is all or nothing.  Perhaps that is thematic, but it detracts from an otherwise fine game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Another great rummy game by Fitzgerald (with Borg this time).  There's more of a "gotcha" feeling to this one, but I still prefer both Jack the Ripper and Rue Morgue simply because they are two player games, which means the games provide much more control (or maybe I've just played and like Gin Rummy too much).  However, IMO there are very few good three player games out there (card games or otherwise) and Wyatt Earp is one of the best, so my rating reflects this.  I know it CAN be played with two, but the cooperativity involved in raising the rewards means it works best (with us) with three.  With four, the loss of control is a bit too much for me.

No long term strategy.  I know that this sounds obvious, but you pretty much can only do what your cards allow you to do.  Meaning that you are not going to play a better game than what you might be dealt.  I never felt I was in control of my game.  It almost seemed like we should deal cards to each other then lay them on the table to see who won.  Huge balance problem with the sheriff cards.  If you have a hand full of them you can't just give good cards to the person to the left of you, but there is nothing that you can do with them as you can only play one per turn.  This doesn't give a player with a bad hand much to do while other people are just making points.  Plus, the rounds are way too short to do anything significant in them.  I you want a fun light western card game get Bang.

Takes a while to sort out the mechanics of this, though it ends up being just slightly more complicated than rummy. It's  distinctly a game for card players; those who appreciate standard-deck games.

“i very pleasantly surprised because i wasn't expecting much. it is a simple set collection/rummy game. what makes it unique? you are both cooperating and competing to apprehend the bad guys, there is a bit of screwage introduced with the sheriff card powers, and sudden end game conditions add juicy tension. i really really like sudden end games. this entry has both a push-your-luck and a gotcha feel. i really want to play this with 3 or 4!! Mike Fitzgerald is becoming a designer i want to watch!

~3 plays, all 2-player.

Not bad. Many similarities to the Mystery Rummy series (obviously), but the luck factor is hugely increased by the special cards that only work some of the time. Makes the game very quirky and drops a point or even two from that alone.

Too much luck involved. The difference between getting a shot and not getting a shot it's maybe too much important for being decided by a luck (draw card) system.

The time of play it's maybe a 10/15 minutes off the schedule.

Rummy with special cards. I enjoy the art and sometimes that's enough for me to be interested in something.

This, along with Carcassonne, was the first ever 'euro' game I purchased, back in 2003 or so. Since, back then, I played only with an ex-girlfriend of mine, this didn't get much play, being ideal for at least 3 players. Now it just sits on a shelf, wondering why it's still around.

RATING: 4.5
Forgettable rummy variant where players meld cards representing seven different outlaws. Each colour has only one value (and one special card) so only sets are possible and the only difficulty is acquiring the right colour. Melding a larger number of cards at once adds more to that outlaw's reward money, which will be distributed amongst players with relevant sets at the end of the round.

Special "sheriff" cards do a variety of things, from pumping up an outlaw to preventing a set from being counted in the scoring.

It works fine, but the luck of the draw really does dominate, particularly with regard to sheriff cards requiring shots. Not interesting.

[RGG 'Wyatt Earp' 2001 edition] {American West; rummy-variant, cooperative with internal competition; optimal 4p} Wyatt Earp is a very nice family game. The novel element of this game is that players have to cooperate together to increase the bounty of an outlaw. Without enough CP, the outlaw can escape! It's very thematic, interactive and fun.  There are more special cards than other MR games but they are easy to understand. The "shooting" rule is interesting, which adds much fun to the game. 

Though it's not included in the Mystery Rummy series, it should be counted as one of them (it's from the same game designer).  Nevertheless, it'd be the best multi-player game in the series but it's not as novel and thematic as others.

The cards are smaller than the MR series. The illustration fits the theme and is easily recognizable. I use poker instead of the money chips. The box is absolutely larger than necessary.

Fun rummy variant!  Using your sets to capture a reward is a lot of fun.  The extra text & detail on the cards is great.  Only drawback, the game can go on a while (over an hour) if you play all the way to $25,000.  But a great way to play a fun but casual card game.  The designer considers this to be his favorite 3 player game.

RATING: 4
Well themed rummy variant, but it isn't filler as a game is likely to take 45 minutes or so.  

Though you don't feel like you have much control of what's going on, I disagree with some of the comments that your plays are totally obvious and limited.  You do have some substantive choice here mostly in the risk vs reward decisions of drawing more cards versus trying to be the first out to catch the others off guard.

It's light, but will take a nongamer at least 1 full game before they really feel like they know what's going on.

Too much luck even for this type of game.

Rummy variation that works well. This one is best with three players, but works for two as well (it is just stupidly quick with two players. It is far too easy to get all the reward/points and block another player from getting reward/points on their melds in two-player games).

This is a fairly simple rummy game, which is not really my kind of game.  However, the theme sort of sucked me in a little bit.  I enjoyed imagining the effects of the Bank Robberies and the Fastest Gun cards.  The hideouts are a bit of a crapshoot, since they can really swing the scoring quite a bit, and they rely on a blind draw to take effect.  That can be a bit annoying, but going in knowing that wacky things can happen makes the game flow quickly.

This is a very good card game.  I have played quite a few games 2-handed, but I'd really like to try with three.  If it does play better with three then I could really see this one going up.

I find the tiny cards annoying. Why can't they be standard size? It keeps me from playing this with my parents because they're odd.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 4
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 4
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 4

Neat little game.  Should rise if it shows some replayability and also shows some place for skillful play.  I'm pretty confident skillful play is there, I just hope its highly replayable.  Nifty spin, and the theme adds a bit.  Just haven't gone back to it, and really no desire to.

This game was a disappointment to me. I expected to play a game that immersed me in the drive to arrest outlaws of the old west.  None of that.  Just a three-of-a-kind matching game with some neat twists and pictures of of the old western frontiers.  Theme is heavy but not applicable to the game play.

About [thing=878][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=878][/thing] is a card game, related to the Rummy family, focused in hand management and set collection. Players try to get rewards by capturing outlaws, using sets of cards to do this, and to rise the value of the bounty.

While it says that there is cooperative play, in order to achieve the required number of capture points to score an outlaw, truly the game is all competitive, as the CP number is, usually, reached regardless of the participation of others, and is more likely that one doesn't want the others to chip in.

[thing=878][/thing] has a good deal of luck of the draw/ Also, you will find some "take that" and bash the leader, but isn't all that strong nor is the purpose of the game, but is possible that, for those that doesn't like these sort of thing, the gameplay can bother.

Overall, [thing=878][/thing] plays fast, have a good amount of decisions (driven by what cards you have and what others played) and works well as a filler in the high end of playing time. But sure won't fit well for everyone.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Everyone starts with a hand of 10 cards. Then, during each turn, the player have two mandatory actions and one optional:
a) Draw card (mandatory) - either two from the draw deck or the top card of the discard pile;
b) Play card (optional) - is possible to play as many Outlaw cards as the person wants, but a maximum of one Sheriff card. To start the hunt for an outlaw, is necessary to play a set of at least 3 Outlaw cards of that outlaw, after this, the minimum of 3 is gone. The value of the bounty for the outlaw rises accordingly to the number of cards played (at the same time) minus 1 x $1000 - therefore, if someone plays 4 cards for, say, Billy the Kid, it would increase the bounty for him by $3000 (4-1x1000);
c) Discard one card (mandatory) - this will become the top card of the discard pile. The player must retain at least 1 card in hand to discard at the end of her turn - it isn't allowed to play all the cards in the hand and have none to discard.

Play goes like this until someone runs out of cards. Then each outlaw that have at least 8 Capture Points after them will be scored. If the player that has the highest CP of an outlaw has 5 or more CPs than the second place, she will take all the reward for that outlaw. If the number is less than 5, the reward will be splitted, with the person with the highest value, at first, taking $2000, than the next $1000, and $1000 to everyone else, returning to the person with the highest if there is still money left (but now, she will only get $1000).

After every outlaw is scored, if someone reached $25000 or more, the game ends and the person with the most money will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
- Which cards to play, considering what have already been played, how many cards the others still have in hand, and, of course, what cards you have in hand;
- If drawing blindly from the draw deck or taking the top card of the discard pile;
- What card to discard - important because your discard will be available for the next player to take.

None of the decisions are truly difficult to make, and most of the time you will be guided by the luck of the draw. [thing=878][/thing] isn't a game heavy on decision-making, but the ones you do, matter.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- The production value is good, with the insert keeping everything neatly stored;
- Easy to teach and to play;
- The reward posters have neat historic information about the outlaws;
- Plays quickly, being basically a meaty filler.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- There is a good deal of luck built in the gameplay;
- Some take that and bash the leader;
- The cards have a weird size and regular mini sleeves won't fit.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Noticing that on the side of the law there are plenty of people wanting to get all the glory to themselves - yet, even if you want to keep your informations about the criminals close to your chest, but, sometimes, won't be able to start the pursue alone, or will need someone else to come in to give enough of a boost to corner up and capture the outlaws. However, the outlaws can escape more times than the inmates in the Arkham Asylum. Bounty hunting is a nasty job, but a photo of the culprit sure helps a lot.

Anyway, [thing=878][/thing] provided us with a good time, with its light gameplay, even if with a heavy dose of [-]whisk[/-] luck; enough so that we played several times in the days that followed its debut, as its short rounds make the sting of the wounds hurt less. I don't have a lot of experience with Rummy games, but as a comparison, we liked [thing=878][/thing] much more than [thing=121764][/thing]. Overall, approved!

Nice, fun little game that you can enjoy with friends, family, and other gamers.  Based on Rummy, the goal here is to capture 7 different historical outlaws and to win the game by earning 25,000 in rewards.

Be sure to play the photo cards as the designer intended (you can play a matching one when a meld is first layed) and the Wyatt Earp card can be played out of turn as well in response to someone playing a hide-out on one of the outlaws in your territory.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A really fun card-driven area majority game that is short and does not overstay welcome. Players draw and play cards to capture outlaws based on card strength. The amount of bounty also increases with card play. The unique mechanism I enjoy here is the method of card draws (one up face up, discard or two cards face down) as well as the fastest gun card. I like that you play the fastest gun  card which is as stable as the next fastest gun played. Very neat since you wan to hold on to the card and play it as close as possible to the final hand. Doesn't always work out that way. 

The game is relatively fast paced with players playing cards to their own tableau while playing some sheriff cards with a fair amount of screwage. Overall thought game flows pretty smoothly.

In any case, the game is old and aged but can still hold its own to the more recent releases. Thumbs up!

Of note, the game does have its luck moment, so be forewarned.

A pretty good variation on the Mystery Rummy style.  I wonder if it is more common to spend more time trying to build up cards than we did?  I know the instructions said it was rare, but we never made it through the deck one, much less the two times needed for the secondary round end to take effect.

alright light fun; fast game; wild west theme;  try to outmaneuver catching the wanted outlaw before the other players do through card manipulation and drafting; variable rewards for each wanted outlaw are tallied at the end for victory

RATING: 8
I usually don't rate games after just one play, but this one is pretty easy for me to rate. I'm starting to become a fan of these rummy variant type games, and this one adds some neat aspects that are unique enough to distinguish it frm the rest of the pack. It's a fast little game that plays quickly and this is something important to me. Although I like longer games, most of the people in my group have a hard time playing a game that takes 2-4 hours.

This a great rummy varient.  As you play melds of wanted posters you add money for the capture of that outlaw.  You can play sherrif cards which can add money and points to your wanted poster melds or take cards from the stack, discard or other opponents.  Across all players the melds for each outlaw have to add up to 8 or the outlaw isn't caught and the reward isn't distributed.  If an outlaw is caught, the reward is distributed to those who participated in the capture.

A fun little card game. I've noticed that my niece really enjoys it when she wins by a big margin. :) Pretty good balance unless you get dealt and draw a bunch of sheriff cards, as you can only play one per turn.

This cousin to the Mystery Rummy series adds a lot of extra fiddliness to the game, but like Race for the Galaxy, once you have a better understanding of the game and how it scores, it falls better into place.  The way that outlaws are captured makes the game much more challenging and interesting than a basic Rummy variant, but for whatever reason, it doesn't work very well with 4 players.  With 3, though, it's just about perfect.

6 plays: 3 players

RATING: 7
Not bad! This was very easy to learn and was quick-playing to (cowboy) boot!  On our first round, we all kept fairly small hands and discarded a lot of our Sheriff cards in favor of holding Outlaws to make and play sets.  Our second round was just the opposite.  We all hoarded our special cards (especially the Hideouts and Wyatt Earps) and didn't play too many sets for fear of having someone play a Hideout on us and neutralize our sets.  As a side note, we also found that making a "Pew! Pew!" noise when checking to see whether our Sheriff cards worked definitely increased their effectiveness!

Never going to be a personal favorite, but very appealing for my wife and extended family.  Much more so than Mystery Rummy (Jekyll and Hyde), oddly.  Creates some nice decision points (the discard is always agonizing) and spices things up.  Pretty random, of course, but that goes with the territory.

I'm not much of a card gamer (not since my ccg days) but this game DOES have quite a 'fun' playability to it. Themes really DO make a difference!

Haha. When did I write this? my card game collection is now rather impressive and I would never turn down a game simply because it is a 'card game' now. - what a schmuck!

Like the entire "mystery rummy" line, Wyatt Earp is easy to teach and learn because it's a variant of a card classic that we all know how to play.  However, the familiarity of the mechanics is the same reason why I lost interest after a few plays.

Still, it fits the bill as a pleasant, disposable gateway game.

It took me 4 1/2 year to play this game, and it turned out to be worth keeping in the collection. It's quite a fun rummy variant, and the theme is great too. We enhanced gameplay (well the western feel anyhow) by playing on green felt and using poker chips instead of the money tokens. I think this might compete with Flaschenteufel as my 3-player card game of choice.

One of the more interesting rummy variant based on a particular theme.  Straightforward and streamlined, much better than the Mystery Rummy series I've tried.  Too bad the game can be bogged down when the deck is inundated with sheriff cards, which also has the effect of making many of them useless.  Good for occasional plays.

A decent rummy-based game by Mike Fitzgerald and Richard Borg, this time in the old west.  As with the Mystery Rummy games, the changes are enough to make Wyatt Earp interesting on its own and the theme seems more tightly integrated rather than just tacked on.

Замечательная карточная игра, идёт на ура в разных компаниях. Основана на сборе коллекций карт преступников по цветам, здесь добавлены различные особые карты с механиками - получилась отлично сбалансированной. Арт на любителя, но мне нравится (олдскульный такой, тусклый). 

Минусы - есть смутное ощущение обычной карточной игры, тяжело играть с новичками, которые своими действиями вносят в игру большой хаос. Большая степень реиграбельности компенсируется необходимостью сыграть по сути 2-3 раза.

I have never been a fan of card games.  This one opened my eyes.  It does not get me on the edge of my seat like a close game of T&E or A&A does, but will probably get played 5x as often and also allow me to drink 5 extra gallons of beer in my lifetime.  Update - 2-26-5:  Lack of strategic options has left this game somewhat dull for me.  I would much prefer any of the Mystery Rummy games, which, unfortunately, don't quite the accessible theme this one does.  As such, I can pretty much get ANYONE to play, and enjoy, this game.

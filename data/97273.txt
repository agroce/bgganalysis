The first play revealed the ruthlessness of this game, rich get richer and poor stay poor. I kinda liked it. Yes, I admit that when I found myself screwed either by my own ineptitude or by other players it was far from fun. Yet, in the end I couldn't blame the game. On the other hand, an unforgiving game poses a challenge some players (like me) might like.

I also liked the theme and the art. However, in contrary to the nice art, graphic design was on the poor side hindering the gameplay. The minuscule font in camouflage colour is something I really do not like. Fortunately all the essential information is on the central board and you do not have to crane over the table to read other players' boards. But still it was bad.

In the end there are more positive than negative things about this title and somehow Upon a Salty Ocean manages to stand above an average euro. I was left with a will to play again.

RATING: 2.5
Suffers from player elimination without allowing the player to leave the game.  The rich get richer and there's no way for anyone to catch up.  This game uses income to purchase actions without restriction which usually allow for more income and VERY long turns.  If a player is in the lead it is easy to continuously select actions to have an endless supply of income well after everyone has passed - the game then becomes an exercise of watching someone play game of solitaire.  I'm not 100% convinced this game is broken, but it sure feels like it.  The AP is heavy and downtime between turns is mind numbing. 

I won't be playing this again.

RATING: 3
The archetypal game as spreadsheet.  All information, apart from events beyond the next turn, is open.  Some assumptions need to be made, but the game is inviting me to calculate the cost and likely benefit of everything, over and over.  Excuse me for half an hour while I go and do that. And this calculation is entirely the game; there is nothing else.  Awful.

Add to this game's woes a board that's a symphony of browns, with text and icons that are too small.  The rules are also poor, failing to explain several key points.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This was everything I expected after our first attempt to play it.  Interesting mechanics and utterly unforgiving of even a small error.  Early in the second round, one player was consigned to last place.  Part way through the third round, a second player was out of the game - consigned to third, and one person was guaranteed the win, by a huge, huge margin.  We all agreed that it wasn't even worth playing the second half of the game.

I will probably give it one more try, but in general I really dislike games which are that brutal to players who make relatively small (and non-obvious) errors.

Upon a Salty Ocean is, at its core, a market manipulation game, with simple and straightforward rules, that could be a good entry-level game for players wanting to explore the genre.
It is based on an incremental cost action system (the more an action is performed, the more it costs) that rewards players doing different things than others, and features a tight, simple but effective market simulation.
It has some flaws, though:
1. the art is far from great, and the graphic design fails to convey all necessary information in an understandable way;
2. the rulebook is quite clear but the information could've been presented in a better way (this is common to every game produced by Giochix.it, by the way) and some form of player aid would've been beneficial;
3. with two players the game is loose and lacks tension.

The initial rating (6.5) is based on 2-player games only, and could easily go up if, as I suspect, the game plays more brutally with 3 or 4 players.

I was asked to explain my rating of the game and the response was:

almost everything in this game can be calculated, and yet _needs_ to be calculated as when is it still profitable to go for another fishing trip isn't readily obvious. in effect the game is either quick and random or VERY long. I like VERY long games much more than the next guy, but only when the time is spent thinking about strategies, not just adding 20 numbers and seeing if they end up +5 or -3. 

as such I am not interested in a 'serious' play of the game as it's too long for what real decisions I have to consider, and am not interested in a 'casual' play as that ends up mostly random and (for me) unfun.

RATING: 7.5
First Play: Rules are a straightforward 2 sides of A4 although the buildings are the key elements to understand. It soon becomes clear that this is a game more about jockeying for position than points on the board in early turns. The key is deciding when to break for the front and whether you can hold on to that position.

The buildings seen inocuous to start but some have a very useful twist.

All in, a game where you must know absolutely what your opponant is aiming for and to knock him down whenever possible. Not a game to focus on maximising points, just securing enough when it counts.

A very clever game that will be played differently in game 2. I look forward to it.

In theory, it should have been a good game. There seemed to be plenty you could do on your turn, along with some tough decisions to be made on balancing the short and long term through use of the buildings in the city. On paper, this seemed like it should give variable paths to victory, but actually once you chose something in the city you couldn't change it later, nor could you oust someone who was already in a space. So to a certain extent, your game was hostage to what you did in your first couple of turns. And worse still, I strongly suspect there is only one path to victory in spite of the outward signs to the contrary - fishing.

Which brings me on to the next problem. Fishing was an incredibly drawn out process, far too detailed. So to fish, you had to take individual turns to load salt on your ship, then sail to the fishing grounds and collect fish, then sail back into the bay, then move to the harbour to offload your fish into your warehouse, then sell them. Five turns just to fish once. (edit: I have since found out we missed a rule which allows you to sell direct from the ship, cutting this to 4 turns, but the point still holds). Tedious in the extreme, and basically everyone was doing the same thing each turn.

You could see this as a game of efficiency, but one where essentially you do the same thing over and over again for the whole game and victory will probably be determined by which random weather tile is turned over rather than player skill. In summary, some nice elements, but they just didn't work together.

The german rules are awful! two misguiding sentences, and we played that game wrong 2 times. The english FAQ´s were a necessary reading. A tough fishing, action point & market game. Your wrong decisions are punished immediately by the co-players. Beware of loans more than 12 coins! One light red or orange color more would help this game much better with setting up the board, so it is all grey and black, like the weather at the atlantic coast.

At first, I thought this seemed like a pretty deep strategy game, but about half way through the first game, it seemed like it was already getting pretty dry and repetitive.

The gist of the game is that you're trying to get the most money throughout the game by running a fleet of ships, and mining salt so that they can head out end catch fish (which of course need to be kept on the salt you mine to preserve their freshness!).  You do this by taking 4 types of actions.

One action allows you to gain or upgrade abilities by utilizing a slew of different buildings.  The buildings might score you end game points, up your salt production, up your storage capabilities, etc.  Your capabilities in these buildings are where a lot of meat of the game is.

The other three actions allow you to build more ships or load your ships, move your ships (to leave on a fishing trip or come back to port), or buy/sell at the market (there are two types of fish, and salt, with a market system to track prices).

Now, it did seem like there were a few paths to victory, but I still found some of the available actions to get repetitive.  For example, if you wanted to head out and catch fish and then bring them back to sell them, there is a preset sequence of actions to take.  You must load salt onto your boat, then move it out to sea, then move it back to port, and then sell it at the market.  It just becomes kind of mechanical and a non-decision once you start the sequence, which made me lose some interest in what I was doing.

Overall, a decent strategy game with a few routes to victory, but nothing stellar to really grab my attention.

Sold to Pete. After an initial play where we had a couple of rules wrong, I was actually pretty excited about this market-driven worker placement game. Rounds last until everyone passes. Folks can keep doing actions until they don't want to do any more. The catch (yes, pun intended - it is a game about cod and herring fishing) is that actions get progressively more expensive through the round and the price for sold fish gets progressively lower as people sell those. Emphasis is on phase management - being out of phase is generally good - and turn order management with a bit of market manipulation thrown in. Ultimately, what looked like two dynamic markets - actions and sales - turned out to to be pretty stale, though. Folks tend to just scrape points together until the cost exceeds the benefit. Screwing other players is tempting but the cost (of later actions) or opportunity cost (of the early ones) is often too great to be aggressive toward just one player. After the second play, I think I'm done.

not sure if it's a game or an accountant exercise, you just have to sell fishes and stop to do it when the costs > sales

some buildings are obviously better than others & you just need to be first or second player in first round to take the good seats

After several games (about 10), I can says this game has several bugs: some buildings are "must have" and there is a player who run away and it's impossible for the others to catch him. I'm testing some additional rules (directly from the author of the game) that close almost all bugs. When I'll test enough these variations, probably I'll change my vote. 
After testing the official variant rules (now I'm at 20 plays) I lowered the vote: these rules fix something but other bugs remain. Not enough playtest. This game could be a good game, but miss a train: playtest.

RATING: 5
Upon a Salty Ocean is a bit of a tricky game to describe as well as get a feel for. Cause is the market mechanism which can make the game play out totally different from game to game. If salt is priced low and fish high, then there will be a huge influx of fish. If it is the other way around, mines will be terribly important. It also means that the value of certain buildings changes from game to game. If you feel that some building are underused or too powerful, you should always ask yourself what would happen if the market hadn't been as it was in your game.

I think that this aspect of the game works rather well. It's fairly simple and straightforward, yet allows for a good deal of richness to evolve. It challenges the players to be flexible and to find more profitable paths based on their knowledge of the relative importance of various buildings. This is a Good Thing. At the same time I can't help but wonder if the game isn't a tad too simple here. Little cubes placed on buildings don't terribly exciting things, which is compounded by the fact that from game to game you'll only see a subset in action. To put it in a different way, I think the UaSO lacks a bit of ambition.

I'll join in a game if asked; I'll not want to own this myself.

A game of balancing when to buy buildings, when to go out to sea to fish, when to buy or sell fish or salt, etc.

Each time an action is taken, it gets more expensive... making for some interesting timing decisions.

We enjoyed it well enough, even with only two players. (It would be better with 3 or 4, I'd guess.)

Update: After a second play with only two players, it feels like the game will fall into a very predictable pattern. We really like the feel and the look of the game--and the action selection mechanism is innovative--but the game doesn't really excel in any area. It's good but not great.

Since we're nearly always either 2 or 5 players, this one will probably get traded.

A few minutes into my first play, I was already admiring the game, and the board art.  But by the end I had some reservations.  I'm not sure about the race to the bottom bidding mechanism for first player.  I'm pretty sure that I don't like that cycling through the shipping routine can be a small profit even when costs for actions are starting to get expensive.  Ideally, I'd want one round to consist of one shipment for most players, and maybe a second for one player in rare exceptions, otherwise rounds are long and boring.  Given all that, I enjoyed it enough to say I'd happily play again.

Upon A Salty Ocean is a tense and tight game of market manipulation, which while similar to other games in this genre is distinct, and approachable, enough that I think it is worth owning if you either particularly enjoy the genre are looking for a good entry point. Because the cost of individual actions is based on how frequently other players have taken the same action, the game greatly rewards performing actions that others are not, and setting yourself up to be in a position where you can beneficially do so is helpful to winning the game. I’ve greatly enjoyed both of my plays of this and look forward to exploring it more in 2012, once I feel like branching out from games that are my favorites from the 2011

[b][Update][/b]: After my 2nd play, I like the game better than my first play. My first game was a 3 players game while my 2nd was with 4. I like it better with 4 players.

The player whom I played with (who won the game) used salt strategy (buying and selling salt), foresee the upcoming events, maxed out at the notre dame space, only own a single ship throughout the game and never even attempt to go to the open sea to catch fish. The other 3 players were struggling converting salts to fish and selling it at the market for a better earning. 

I don't find this broken, and I don't want to think this as a flaw. We discussed among ourselves that yes there's a better strategy to counter the salt strategy. Hopefully I'll find out more about this game with more plays.

Everything wrong with the modern Euro. The entire game is focused solely on the action track and hedging your bets against what other people are going to plan for that turn. So, now I get some white cubes, and now I will trade those for pink cubes, and now I will sell those for points, and now I have to pay do this, and now I do this. My collection has zero room for this kind of thing.

The poor graphic design on the board doesn't help. I constantly have to look up what each building does. This is economics without any excitement at all.

RATING: 5
We've played twice 2 player, and finally gave it away when we realized that were probably never going to play it again.  

It's not a bad game, but neither is it a really great game, and it's competing for a niche in which there are many great games I would rather play.

It's main problem is that it lacks tension.  The fact that someone taking the action you want before you only raises the cost by 1 just makes it feel too easy.  And while there are occasional important decisions, much of the game felt fairly obvious and routine.  Overall it seems a little too simplistic, and the actions a bit fiddly.
 
What tension does exist is in the market, where sale timing can be critical (although it seems too easy to diffuse an opponent's big haul by a quick buy and sell of a fish or two to bring the price down). But being first to the market means manipulating the turn order by trying to go into debt as much as you can, which just doesn't feel at all natural.  The fact that there is hardly any penalty for indebtedness (but a hard limit at the bottom) makes it feel even less realistic.  The big cash swings are kind of amusing, but also feel a little gimmicky.  

There was a lot of attention paid to thematic details in terms of buildings and stuff, and it is theme that I found particularly interesting  (I generally like realistic historic themes).  But the problem is that the game as a whole doesn't feel thematic, even though there are lots of thematic details, because the central mechanic feels too contrived. I don't feel like I am behaving the way that a merchant would behave, and all the fancy building names can't erase that central flaw.
  
Maybe it is better with more players, but I just couldn't bring myself to be bothered trying - there are so many other things I would rather play!

Rating based upon one game in the hotel at Essen 2011.  Good solid worker placement game that is fairly tight and which the depth of the buildings and some of the gameplay only comes out towards the end of the game.  I would love to play this game more (with the right sort of people) to explore the depth: unfortunately that isn't going to happen as they will seek to play worker placement games from snazzier publishers and snazzier themes.  If I didn't have so many games already then I would have bought this AND be trying to persuade people to play it.

Rules are simple and straight forward.  However planning ahead is essential. The rich get richer, so falling behind can be disastrous. However, with careful planning everyone can increase their coffers so that the race is neck to neck.  

It is somewhat like Age of Steam in that once you go into unrecoverable debt, you are out of the game.  In the Age of Steam, you are out.  In this game if you have been a careless spender, you might sit and watch everyone else take 15 more actions on their turn to your one or two.

Upon a Salty Ocean bears some resemblance to Kavai in that actions become more expensive the more often they are chosen during a round. The currency required to pay for those actions is much more easily available, though, so the game isn't quite as brutal.

Even so, being out of phase with the other players is hugely beneficial, and players go to great lengths (and expenses) to get there. In fact, it often seems that it doesn't matter all that much what you do; the deciding factor is when you do it.

While I have enjoyed my first play and I'm sure it's good for a couple more, I'm wondering if the strong focus on timing doesn't ultimately lead to very similar game arcs. But for now, it's in dubio pro reo.

A nice idea and all, but sadly not very well balanced. This game needs a rule to kick other people out of the buildings, as it's kinda boring without that function, especially in a 2 palyer game, which I can't recommend at all. I guess it's much better as a 3 or 4 player game, but the buildings are still not balanced.

This may be themed around the sea, but it's dryer than the desert. You get money by going to sea (there are no other major sources of income) and then return home to spend it on buildings that give you minor privileges or the cathedral that somehow returns the money you invest. This is Eurogaming at its worst, point mongering and trying to find value in the game's action 'market'. Crushing mediocrity. For me this is the final confirmation that the golden age of Euros is now gone.

A very unforgiving and dry economic game, with a rather poorly tacked-on theme based on buying and selling fish.

First impressions were good, the art work is wonderful and the game looks very tidy and thematic.  However, once the pieces came out that impression changed - the text on the tiles and the icons on the spaces are incredibly small, and the colour scheme does not help them to stand out at all, surely a sign of poor planning.  This poor planning seems to be reflected in the gameplay mechanics also:

For example, some of the spaces on the board seem to give you almost no benefit, whereas some of them give you powers beyond belief - one of them lets (only one player) see the next two market adjustments and swap them if he likes, basically meaning either he'll get a fortune for his fish, or the other players will get next to nothing.  The money you get for the fish is very important as you pay for actions using money, the main action being to move up a track which grants points at the end of the game.  If one player gets rich at some point in the game, he will simply fly up this track and ensure a game-winning stack of points at the end.

The whole game seemed unbalanced and rather unforgiving, I understand that for some players this is great but my score reflects the fact that I don't find it much fun at all.  A shame because the art is so lovely - the only reason it gets a 2 rather than a 1.

I have very mixed feelings about this game. I love the historical theme and the beautiful board, and I think there is a solid and quite interesting game here. But the prettiness of the board is undercut by functionality issues: It should be about 30-50 percent bigger (or at least the iconography should), since as it is the players are squinting and peering over cubes to see what all the buildings do. Tracking info on the board is fiddly; you need to adjust the positions of 2-3 markers for most actions. Worst of all, teaching the game involves a big info dump: The game's basic mechanic is quite elegant, but then players have to absorb the special abilities of a dozen different buildings. Gameplay is quite unforgiving of mistakes, which I don't view as a negative per se, but coupled with the teaching burden, I am unlikely to push this on new players, so I am unlikely to get this to the table often. For me, this sits squarely in the territory of "won't suggest but will happily play if asked." (Also, the game does not work well 2-player; just too gamey.)

RATING: 7
Interesting market-driven game. There are a number of nice elements interacting here...the escalating price of actions, the incentive to go into debt, market manipulation. Each game I've played has resulted in very different arcs, which is nice.

Still, it doesn't knock my socks off, and it can get a little bit mathy. The building that allows a player to muck with the market sticks out like a sore thumb. It hasn't been overpowered, but I'd probably prefer a version with no hidden market tiles and no tile manipulation.

Nice surprise.  I haven't expected it from what I heard/read about the game.
Very interesting design.  It looks fresh and compelling at first sight.  Players' moves are fast and not complicated (mechanically), yet they are meaningful enough.

But still not enough charm here to convince me to buy the game.
And I have _serious_ doubts about replayability...

A market economy game in the same vein as Planet Steam, but with generally more to do.  Clever action selection mechanism - one can take as many actions as one has the money to take, with the cost of each going up as others select the same action.

This game will benefit from an experienced group.  I also am concerned that fishing will turn out to be too action-intensive to compete with market manipulation, particularly as market manipulators will not have much trouble trashing the fishermen's commodities.  This perhaps makes for a brutally thematic game (speculators getting the best of primary producers) but perhaps not such an interesting one to play.

This is speculation however; my first play was enjoyable and though the particular skills this game requires aren't those I enjoy exercising, I think Upon a Salty Ocean is on par with Planet Steam if not better.

Very much a standard Euro in the vein of those that dominated the gaming scene in the middle of the last decade. It borrows elements from Kaivai (action cost), Power Grid (turn order) Puerto Rico, and  Caylus (buildings with different powers), but with less tension than any of them. I also fear that the ability of a single player in Fierte St. Romain to view and change future event tiles may be too big of an advantage for the others to overcome. 

WIFE RATING/Comments - 5
I like the fishing process (converting salt to fish) but I felt the buildings in general didn't matter. The game seemed too much tit for tat and it feels like there is a runaway leader problem.

Worth a play or two but after one play I doubt that there's much more to be seen on repeat plays as everything came into play on first outing. I expect that players will get more careful not to overspend, competition for Notre Dame might be stronger, salt speculation will be known beforehand and especially nobody will end up at -22 money without a safe opportunity to earn money without cost. With experienced players it should boil down to choosing the less contested strategy (shipping vs. Notre Dame vs. market speculation) while tactically squeezing out every single coin where possible.

RATING: 5
A little disappointing given that I like the theme and the artwork. There's really not a lot of search space on this one due to a lack of interesting buildings. Most of your score is not going to come from fishing, which is weird in a game about fishing.

However, the action selection mechanism is pretty cool, I admit.

Probably one of my favorite Euros.  Just a real nice and clean design.  Very challenging.  VPs are your currency which makes for some tough decisions knowing how and when to spend.  With experienced players, plays under 90 minutes.  A caution for new players:  I've been in two games where someone went to -22 and didn't have a way of making any money.  The option then becomes to house rule it or let them sit idly the remainder of the game.  The better option is to be aware of this possibility and avoid it (should be explained in the rules that this could happen).

Based on one, three-player game.  Good game and attractive artwork.  I like that players can take unlimited actions and that as each action is used it becomes more expensive.  I also like that there is a single commodity (victory points/money) for paying for and benefiting from actions taken.  However, the game is very unforgiving especially to early mistakes.  This coupled with the need to understand the many available buildings (fifteen) and their powers makes this game not very friendly to new players especially when playing against experienced players.  Although the artwork on the board is attractive, the poor building descriptions on the board and the lack of player aids makes for a steep learning curve with respect to building actions.

I like the game and would play again but I'm not sure to what degree I'd seek it out.

Well well... what do I say. I haven't have this kind of experience in a l-o-n-g time. Here we have a typical eurogame where everything can be calculated, you repeat all the basic moves from round to round and for example when you want to get some fish (and make money with them) you have to make FOUR non-surprising turns before you get what you wanted. And that really means, that for that move you "lost" FOUR turns. So, what I try to say is, that in this game you can do only small moves on your turn and wait a long time, before you are finished for that -> how boring is that. And what comes to graphics etc., Upon a Salty Ocean has big usability problems: icons are ridiculous small and you'll need some extra help sheets to understaind what every building does. Cheese!

[i]Upon a Salty Ocean[/i] is an optimization game.  But as much as it's a game of optimization, it's a game of timing.  In that respect, it reminded me of [thing=75212][/thing]; the market mechanics are similar and it's important to get to your fish (or wine in the case of [thing=75212][/thing]) to market before the other players if you hope to get the best price.  Something about it reminds me also of [thing=43015][/thing].  Maybe it's just the artwork and the cubes, or maybe it's that it's just a little too dry and abstracted.  While it's definitely worth a few more plays, I'm not sure it will be a "regular" in our rotation.

Good euro. Theme fits the game, so it doesn't feel like a standard cubepusher. Money is tight initially, and the indirect interactivity is quite strong during the whole game; you really need to watch what you're opponents are doing.

RATING: 7
Initially I loved this one but after some exploration, I'm beginning to have my doubts.  The game is unforgiving and making certain mistakes (esp. early ones) can knock a player out of the running.  Replay value may be lacking a bit.  It feels after the opening moves have been made that later moves become obvious and the game almost plays itself, which I don't feel is a good thing.

One of the main problems in our group is that players like to go dangerously into debt in order to become the starting player in the subsequent turn.  This causes a situation where, if several try to do this, all are burned but one player.  Usually, the players who sell first have more money and can hold out longer in the round.  Then after other players pass, one of these players spends himself down into last place and steals the first move from someone else poised to otherwise move first.

I really do enjoy the cube-pushing aspect.  It's a mechanic I would love to see in more games.

Upon a Salty Ocean is a game about French fishermen in the 16th Century: they mine salt and build boats, then fish, sell their wares, and finally spend money for fame, fortune and victory. Ho hum. But there is something new (new to me, anyway) - players can take as many actions as they like, but each action increases the cost - and money is victory points at the end of the game! So I could pay $8 to fish this round, and have holds full of salted fish next round, ready to sell... Or I could wait and fish when the cost is only $1, but maybe someone else gets to market first! Or I could spend $7 building the lighthouse, because if I wait my opponent might build it first - she has lots of cash...
Working out timing of actions, deciding the cost/benefit of the different choices, is really intriguing. This is a very good game.

Upon a Salty Ocean is a fairly pure economic game.  You invest in ships, salt (which turns into fish), and special powers via buildings, and then go fishing and sell those fish to turn a profit.  What stands out here is the action system--each time a player takes a type of action, like moving a ship or investing in a building, the cost for that action increases by one for that round.  This forces players to do a cost/benefit analysis for each of his moves: Should you perform an action while it's cheap?  Should you make sure you get in an action before someone else does?  Should you just wait until next turn when the costs reset?  The game itself is pretty dry and very thinky.

Economical game mostly about calculating the difference between the cost of your actions vs the benefit.

--May2002-- A nice crunchy unforgiving and confrontational not-quite-perfect-information cube-pusher.

I had read that this was pretty unforgiving and after playing it, I can't decide if it's your decisions that make it unforgiving or just whether or not getting into certain buildings.  I can understand what's going on and what the game is trying to accomplish, but I'm not sure if I'm playing the game or it is playing me.  The escalating cost of actions is a nice wrinkle.  It's an ok game, though I certainly don't need to own it and I'm not sure that I even need to play it again.

Intresting economic game. Very unforgiving to mistakes. Tends to become a deep thinking game. I would wish for a slight bit more randomness or player-interaction, as it might become very deterministic.

To me it sometimes, espacially towards the end, it seems more like solving a 7th grade math riddle, then an actual game.

So nice game at the beginning and the midpart of the game, but the "finish" is kind of boring and dry, and hard to swallow.

RATING: 4
Upon a Salty Ocean sure has some interesting ideas and an interesting economic engine, but taken as whole, it's just too unwieldy. You need to go fishing regularly to win, but the process is quite involved: is takes at least four actions to get and sell the stuff (five if you have to buy additional salt) and when prices and transactions costs are unfavourable, the profit can be very modest indeed.

Second, the buildings are a very mixed bunch. Some are quite important in the beginning, but too many of them only provide a small benefit and some additional points at the game end. They don't provide much in the way of different viable strategic choices.

What settled it though was the game length. This easily takes up to three hours and I cannot see it dropping to below two. And the game just doesn't provide enough interesting choices to justify that length. Give me (Age of) Steam, with which it bears some similarities, any day instead of this.

Like it a lot after 2 plays.
Especially the in my eyes quite unique "Money for actions but also Money = Points" system works great.
The two plays were quite different. The first was won by massive Notre Dame Building, the second was won by me without adding a single brick to Notre Dame.

But still I fear my biggest argument against this game might be true as well: Limited replayability.
(Some others say its a whole lot of math the whole time but thats no fault for me.)

With the fixed setup, a dozen buildings (a limited complexity) and the only random different element from one game to another being the demand-cards (and of course other playlers actions) I'd say I want to play another 3-5 times before I'm looking for another game.

Strange because Puerto Rico, my favorite game, has almost the same limitations and didn't get boring for more than 100 games. Maybe my fear is wrong?

I think I need to play again soon to sort this out!
PS: I also admire the graphics.

Another entry in the market simulation genre. There are some clever things going on here, particularly the action selection mechanism that makes actions get more expensive the more often they are chosen. I generally count games of this type among my favorites and i certainly liked Upon a Salty Ocean well enough  However, this game falls a bit short for me compared to others such as Key Market or Planet Steam because the market is just not dynamic enough -- selling does lower the price of goods but players can't effect price increases (other than one player who can swap around a few of the round tiles that usually but not always raise prices at round start).  So it felt a bit too constrained to me compared to the no-holds-barred market brawl that can be found in other examples of the genre.

RATING: 7
An economic game at heart, this one offers a nice selection of action choices as you scratch out a living as a member of a fishing village. The component design is top shelf- I really like the way that building ownership is tracked through the use of player markers on the board rather than with building tiles placed in the player's personal area. A bit mathy at times as players maximize the efficiency of their action choices, but the overall experience was positive.

There are too many Euros like this. A deluge that long ago flooded us; there's only room for 2 on the ark and this isn't one of them. I fear, when we find dry land, those two will breed like rabbits again and... wait, this is like the fourth flood, right?

2 plays, including a discovery play in Essen.
I am sure there is a good game here. I am still on the fence whether it is good, or *really* good.

I was wondering about variability, I no longer worry. Events/market evolution drastically change the landscape of the game.

I was wondering if fishing was too strong. I no longer, because one player did funny things manipulating the market to crush fishermen: he bought small quantities end of the turn (of both fishes) and sold them twice next turn, lowering prices, making money more difficult to get. He made little to no profit, but neither did the others when they understood what was happening.

In the end I think the game is a little more complicated than people think after one play, and that most assumptions of "there is only one path out" are wrong. But I'll check that easily, just adding more plays.

EDIT: 4 plays now and living to expectations. Though I definitely do prefer it with 4P. By far.

This is an outstanding middle-weight economic game with lots and lots of interaction and aggression through a very simplified game turn.  It reminds me a little bit of games like Container and Age of Steam, where the turn angst is ramped up as you try to determine the right time to go for a particular action, since the timing of your actions in this game is critical.  It's also an unforgiving game, and if you don't figure out the criticality of being on the -22 spot on the income track, the game will wind up being very long and uneventful for you.  The game is in desperate, desperate need of player aids, and the publishers should be ashamed of themselves for not including one right out of the box.  Luckily, there is an excellent aid here on BGG that will solve the problem, but it shouldn't be up to the players to have to do that sort of thing.  I get the feeling this is going to wind up being one of those "underrated gem" or "excellent games you're not playing" games in a year or so.  More folks should be playing this game.

This is a business game. Buy until you are in debt. Then sell to get out of debt. Then do it again and hopefully after several rounds of this you will be in position to make a big sale. You also buy buildings with bonuses. the cool mechanism is that things cost more and more as players buy them each round. Not to complicated but I did not enjoy it.

Deceptive game. Spend VP (cash) for 4-different actions, that action price now goes up for all players for that round.   Idea is simple: Get salt -> Get fish -> sell it on the market when the price is high and before other players do the same.  Buy as many boats as possible and repeat.   Also buy buildings for their respective powers. 

I liked it, not enough to buy it.

There are things I did not like.

1. Icons are not good or clear enough
2. Too many buildings to remember, and even remember what they do; there is no crib sheet.  Buildings need to be numbered so people can find them in the rules quickly!!!
3. The rules are VERY poor. Lots of ambiguities and things are not clear or do not make sense.  It talks about captains, but there are no captains in the game.  It doesn't cover edge cases about losing 4-unit cube salt/fish when incuring damage and doesn't explain the various events well enough and their edge cases (including Pirates!)

Not much new here in terms of mechanics, but a solid Euro nonetheless where you send out your ships to get fish and move your workers to get victory points and special abilities.  The board design could have been better because the building abilities could have been clearer.

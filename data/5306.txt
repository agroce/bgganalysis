Really great fun - fast play, simple and feels genuinely like a baseball game for some inexplicable reason. I like the version I played with the score dials - completely added to the theme. Perhaps this is the best sports filler available?

Big baseball fan game which is last for 10~15 min per match.

It's not statistic nor simulation, but fun..who cares the luck or not!

RATING: 6.75
Played solo drawing directly from the deck for the opponent and a house rule for the opponent's Relief cards. As many other say it gives a great feeling of Baseball, at least in general term and for a non expert like me. It would be nice to appreciate more the different plays that actually have the same effect on the game.

Played this again, recently, and I'm really glad I hadn't gotten around to entering here yet, because now I can give an 8 instead of having to upgrade my old rating to an 8.  I really like this one.  Like En Garde, Harry's Grand Slam Baseball is proof that a game can be really simple, yet fun... and surprisingly thematic - that's the cool part.  Your 3-card hand limit means your decisions are few, so the game moves along at a good clip... and yet a good number of your choices seem meaningful, supplying the fun of the game.  But, best of all, it just somehow [i]feels[/i] like baseball.  Wow.  I can totally see how I'd have played hundreds of games of this as kid (if I'd had it back then)... and maybe that's part of why I like it, too.  In addition to being really good, it kinda reminds me of being a kid :)

If OOTB hadn't reprinted it (which I'm happy they did) I'd rate it a little higher for the rarity.  A very light filler of a baseball game.  Has just a tiny bit of strategy, but it still 95% luck.  Still makes a nice quick filler when you have 10-15 minutes.

RATING: 5
Ended up being a bland card game to me.  I could see the appeal of it for a baseball fan.  I'm a mild fan and would rather play other two player card games than this.  

Update.  Gave game to friend for him and his son (who is a huge baseball fan at 8).  I think it found a good home.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A light card game for two players that models the highlights of a baseball surprisingly well. Though the game seems to play itself a bit and a healthy dose of luck comes in the deal of the cards, there is a bit of strategy to the affair and the deck shuffle at the end of innings 3 and 6 generally levels the playing field over a bad run of cards. The game is remarkably fast-- a 9-inning game really IS over in 15-20 minutes. You could easily play a World Series match in a couple hours. While possibly too light for hard-core sports gamers and baseball afficianados (no pitching duels or rosters to assemble), this is an excellent filler while waiting for a space to open in another game. Almost like two people watching a baseball game as they play a hand together.

Very fun, very light card/board hybrid that manages to feel like a swell baseball game.  My girls, when they were four and six, loved this game, and still do.

Good light game, not vast amounts of strategic decision, but remarkable amounts of narrative hidden in there.

The scores are too high, we remove at least one home run card.

RATING: 8
Quick, fun 2 player game.  It aged well because it prides itself on the principal that games should be enjoyable and the gameplay should be well-constructed giving people interesting choices.  Being a baseball fan is somewhat of a prerequisite, since the tension of the game of baseball is still preserved here and only works for those who get it.  This will probably be the most often played 2 player filler from now on.

This little gem is really growing on me.  Rating is based on current number of plays, and may really go up.  For what it is, it's sublime, and by the end of the game within the game I really feel like I've had a solid baseball experience.

May 2007 - My son has just started little league.  This game has such great theme that it allows me to talk about the events and rules of baseball.  The game is high on luck and low on choices, but that is O.K.  There are some more strategic variants listed on the geek that I'll try out some day.  But for now, this is a good way to "talk" baseball with my sons.

Played with the 5 card variant (some cards for offense and some for defense), but the game still isn't that exciting.

Incredibly light and quick baseball simulation that still manages to capture the "feel" of a baseball game, somehow.  It honestly couldn't be any lighter.   Play a card - that's it.   And which card to play is quite obvious.   And very dependent upon luck of the draw.  The game has a classic look and feel to it, which I appreciated.

It's a fun game to play with kids.  The price is great for what you get and the retro 1950 card art and scoring wheels are very fun to play with.  It feels like a classic old card game and it's easy and relaxing to play- just don't expect too many interesting decisions.  It's short and simple, making it great for non gaming friends and family members.  Two player only.  I don't like baseball and I like this game quite a bit.  I think it's the most hands off-luck driven game in my collection.  If you record a baseball game on TV and then watch it in fast forward, that's what this game feels like.

I just need to find someone who like it as much as I do so it will get more play.

I expected such a simple game to be dead boring.  Instead its turned into my go to card game.  So inspired by it I am making a homebrew set using basbeall card images for the card images.  Only complaints? the deluxe inning/score keeping insert is crap.  If it looked like an outfield wall and was about HALF its current size, that would be great. As is? bleh.  May have to make my own manual scoreboard...

I have fond memories of this game as a kid growing up to love baseball.  My crazy uncle and I would sometimes play before Orioles games at Memorial stadium.  A ballpark (hah!) guess would be that I've played it about 40-50 times.  While it's not terribly deep, it plays fast and is a very good way to teach kids the subtleties of some baseball rules and tactics.

My first mistake was to declare that I was the home team at Ebbets Field.  Oh sure, the 'Boys of Summer' played a stellar game on the whole, and for a large part of the game I held the lead.  Then the first meltdown heartbreak occurred, and we ended up going into extra innings.  The tension was fierce, and then my pitcher became a belly itcher and gave them a 4 run lead in the 13th Inning.  The bats came alive, but it was a day late and a run short.  Wait til next year!

(Fun, light game)

I want to like Harry's Grand Slam Baseball.  The cards and the box have a charming appearance, and I think there's definitely a niche for a super-streamlined baseball game like this.  The fast and simple mechanism of back-and-forth cardplay seems like it should work well, but unfortunately it fails to create any interesting decisions.  The offense-defense cycling of the innings sucks nearly all the hand management decisions out of the game.  The game as written is probably about 95% luck of the draw, placing it in the "why bother"
category.

Try the variant I've posted to add a little more strategy to the card play.  The basic idea is that each player has two hands, an offensive hand and a defensive hand.  At the end of each half-inning, you are allowed to transfer one card from your current hand to your other hand.  The variant forces players to deal with bad cards, which means they will actually have to make a few decisions.

Ahhh … the sights, sounds, and smells of attending a game at the local ballpark are imbedded in the memories of many Americans.  The smell of popcorn, the taste of a ‘dog covered with kraut and mustard, the sound of a bat cracking against the ball:  all are part and parcel of a trip to the park.  

While these experiences cannot physically be recreated in a card game, Harry’s Grand Slam Baseball from Out of the Box comes close to capturing the atmosphere.  This fast-paced card game recreates the excitement of baseball, with players swinging for the seats and turning dramatic double-plays.  Pinch-hitting, base stealing, sacrifice bunting, relief pitching and more are all options for the team managers.  Yet, the rules are simple, and the game has no complicated team charts or statistics to maintain.  Indeed, a full game can be played in 10 - 15 fun-packed minutes.

While not filled with strategy, complex hitting and pitching charts, or overly taxing decisions, Harry’s Grand Slam Baseball succeeds in simulating a fast-paced, action-packed baseball game filled with exciting moments and unexpected thrills.  One can practically taste those ball park ‘dogs while playing, and players will undoubtedly be overcome by the urge to belt out a chorus of "Take Me Out to the Ballgame!"

Not bad really. A good lake game (cabin game, played on a porch looking out over water say). Random, not a lot of control, but it does capture the ebb and flow of watching a baseball game unfold. You do have hand management to do and you try to influence the game as you can, but your powers of doing so are really like rooting from the stands and getting caught up in, "they're making a rally, guys on base, will they drive them in?"

Doh! Struck out! Damn.

This is a fun little game that lasts just the right amount of time for its weight.  I have a hard time seeing how the outcome of the game is not determined by the luck of the draw, but I guess there is a little bit of hand management involved.  You want to save the hits for when you're up to bat, but you may have to use them in favor of your opponent if you're not careful.  In this respect it reminds me of Twilight Struggle.

"Harry's Grand Slam Baseball" was created by a German immigrant who saw his first baseball game at Fenway Park circa 1958 and immediately realized the strategy involved in baseball. Given that it's a beer & pretzel card game that takes only a few minutes to comprehend, it's a rather brilliant game. 

Players hold three cards at a time and can hold extra cards depending on luck of the draw and the situation. Each half inning players take turns playing cards, trying alternately to score runs or prevent them from being scored by playing cards. So, there's plenty of strategy. 

And, by removing certain cards from the deck, one can get as much or little offense or defense as one wants. Personally, I remove both home run cards, one triple card, one balk card and one sacrifice bunt card. 

My one variant is that a runner can advance from 2nd to home on a 2-out single, or from 1st to home on a 2-out double, but only in those cases. In my opinion, the game is much more tactical that way, and games are often nail-bitingly close. It works, and it's very fun to play. 

My 10-year-old son (as of April 2009) really got into it, rating it a 9.5.

An excellent 2-player filler. It seems far ahead of its time. It is fast, there is just enough strategy to keep it interesting, but it does have a healthy dose of luck. The three-card hands seem the perfect size and the dump hands and reshuffle every three innings mechanism keeps card counting at bay.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Although not a baseball fan, I was interested in this design to see if it presented a simplistic narrative. The assortment of cards, and the movement of runners around the base certainly invoke the feeling. However, there is no real decision making and you are at the mercy of the card draw. I misunderstood the role of the Pinch hitter card, thinking there was some timing skill as to when to "capture" a favourable card, but alas, the Pinch hitter is played straight away.

There is a bit of strategy here, but an awful lot of card luck as well.  I would've given my glove arm for this game when I was nine, but now...

A largely random game that might appeal to baseball fans, especially baseball fans with kids. It plays quickly, but there's nothing particularly notable about the design other than its good theming.

[1 play] This game is a keeper for kids. There is just a little bit of hand management, but mostly luck. It gives you the thematic feel of a quick baseball game. Can be learned in 30 seconds and 9 innnings played in 15 minutes. 

Most recent play 4-5-06 with Garrett.

Kept at Net Lake.

[BGCOLOR=#FFFF00][COLOR=#000000]Family.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Card. Great light game, it really feels like baseball despite the simple gameplay, and it elicits cheers/groans when you drive in the game-winning run. :thumbsup: Keeping it around to play with my kids eventually.

Cute simulation of watching a baseball game.  Light and fast with a couple of occasional decisions.  Mostly it is just an experience game where the cards you draw have more influence on your game than anything you do.

A little monotonous and not much there.  It's a good "beer & pretzels" game but really, I have so many.  The theme is 10+ but I wish the game had some more decisions to it.

I am NOT a baseball fan ... I barely even know the rules. Nevertheless, this was a fun little card game - it made me think Hey, maybe there is some strategy to baseball after all! OTB did a great job with their reissue of this classic. The game I played was with Mike Fitzgerald, and that may have had something to do with my enjoyment of it - his radio-voice does a nice job as game-announcer with this game!

It's so paper thin on strategy, but it has two things going for it.  First, it was designed that way-to play quickly, and it is fun in a light, amusing way.  Second, and most importantly, it's BASEBALL!

So many of my GeekBuddies like this game that I had to pick up a copy. Having played it a few times, I wish I had some of whatever they were smoking when they played. I've read a number of comments saying this game was "ahead of its time", and that baffles me. [thing=3954][/thing] is older, and has tons more to offer, regardless of whether you're looking for thematic flavor or game play.

I could see playing it with kids, or total non-gamers, but I can't see the fascination for gamers. All the decisions are dead obvious - you play outs on the other guy and cards that move base runners on yourself. The optional rules add no depth, but simply suggest you remove cards for a higher or lower scoring game. Unless you think an average game should be 11-10, with multiple errors, passed balls and balks for both teams, the low scoring option is probably your best choice for something that resembles actual baseball.

In sum, if you want interesting decision making, or an accurate statistical model, look elsewhere. If grandma's complexity threshold is Uno, and she likes baseball, I can recommend this as a good replacement. Otherwise, I'd look elsewhere.

Update: I've played again under different circumstances, and bumped my rating up a couple of points as a consequence.

This time around I was thinking about an intro for my grandson, who's very interested in baseball, which makes me appreciate how much baseball flavor is packed into this simple design. For anyone looking for a light, quick baseball game, this fits the bill.

RATING: 5
[Out of the Box 2004 edition] {Sport; hand management} Usually, it's not easy to design sport board/card games because it can easily be compared to video games. As a result, there not many good sport games around. This baseball game is a good one. It's true to the theme and is quite fun. At its core, it's a simple hand management card game. There is no special mechanic; however, the theme is really outstanding (without the theme, I would rate it 4). The new components (from OOTB) really help to enhance the game experiences. It's quite luck dependent and decisions are limited. 

p.s. I like baseball games and I was the school team member. Therefore, it gets into my collection easily.

Alright, so this is an extremely light sorta take that card game, there's a LOT of luck, only a few decisions here and there, etc.

But it's really short, simple, fun, and quite amazingly actually evokes a baseball feeling while you're playing it.  I like it.  I can't believe something so simple works so well.

I think any baseball fan would enjoy it, but someone that doesn't like baseball would very likely not see the point.

Based upon a single play, I really like this game.  It's essentially a card game that uses baseball rules.  Nothing fancy, no fiddly rules.  Just straight-forward and fun.

RATING: 6
A classic example of a game that shouldn't work but does. It's incredibly simple, to the point that I had given up on it midway through reading the rules. That's it? But it actually works quite well, plays quickly and fits very well with the baseball theme. Definitely brings on some nostalgia for similar games played as a kid, although this wasn't one of them for me. Worth a try for any baseball fan.

Great 2-player card game to play with your kids. My six year old and I have played many, many times and it still is a lot of fun. Only takes about 15 minutes to set up and play, so it's perfect when you have a little time to kill. Most games end up being very close and are tense in the final innings.

RATING: 6
I am a baseball nut so this is a fun filler for me.

The game does a nice job of providing a baseball experience with simple hand management. The genius is that some of the hand you are using on offense now will be the hand you will be using on defense after you make three outs. It makes for some interesting choices and asking yourself how much can you afford to help your opponent.

Bridge it ain't, but it is very enjoyable and can lead to some exciting, shout-inducing endings.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 4
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 5
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4


Overall - 4.5

No, it's not strat-o-matic though it does scratch the baseball itch with simple, fun game play.  At its heart its a card game (play-a-card-draw-a-card-progressive-trick take?!?) with some luck and some skill but the perfectly applied baseball theme makes this a great filler.

Light, fun game.  Feels like baseball.  It's often amusing when you're on offense but the only cards you have are defensive cards.  Or better yet, when you're on defense and you use your relief pitcher and discover a home run.  Oops.  Looks like my relief pitcher is having a bad day...  :-)

Love the mechanic of keeping the same cards whether you are on offense or defense.  Not a great deal of strategy but it is a fun filler that feels more like baseball than Pizza Box Baseball

Appealing baseball flavor, and not just luck (actually I would say there is about the same amount of luck as there is in real baseball, which is to say, a lot, but your decisions do matter). Scores tend to be higher than in MLB. Quick to play. The indestructible metal box is nice. I can imagine some house rules to increase the realism a bit without really adding much brain-load.

if you like baseball, you can play this all day long.  luck, simple and fun.  a must have ......fun for kids adults and all other creatures.

Update:  Dropping rating a notch........we just have played the heck out of it.......and love it and will always have it around, but it's simplicity (great for kids, or beer and pretzels infested adults) is underwhelming sometimes..  I always enjoy playing, but it is starting to be, "I have to be in that right Harry's sunny day no worries mood to play it." A fair weather friend.

RATING: 7
Fun little filler game.  Not a lot of strategy involved but it's a little more than just play and draw.  Perhaps I enjoyed it more than I should :).  The theme is baseball.  Each player has a hand of 3 cards.  Starting with the player who's up and alternating, each player chooses and plays a card which simulates an at bat.  Then they draw a replacement.  Every 3 innings all cards are reshuffled.  There are pinch batters and relief pitchers if you don't want to play a card from your hand and you're lucky enough to have previously drawn one.  Please don't take it too seriously.  It's a kids game that should be fun for the light of heart.

RATING: 5
Gets the feel of baseball right, but I have a hard time seeing playing this more than extremely casually.  The decisions are very minor, and the game has a tendency to run itself.  Still, it's extremely short and manages to simulate the vagaries of the game pretty well.  There's plenty of worse choices out there when you're killing time waiting for other players, and this is easily the best sports-themed filler I've found.

A classic, quick-playing baseball card game republished now by Out of the Box (originally published in 1962). It's a light, breezy way to pass the time with enough of a baseball theme to scratch the itch, and a good back-and-forth pace -- a great game value for about $10. [UPDATE] I'm simply amazed at how incredibly fun this quick card game is. Harry's Grand Slam Baseball is far more than the sum of its parts.

A cool, simple baseball game.  Glad that OTB reprinted it.

Good way to teach a young person the basic rules of baseball.

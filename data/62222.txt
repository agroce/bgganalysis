GAME: Commands & Colors: Napoleonics
RANK: 293

RATING: 5
Not as much fun as Ancients, the leaders are weaker and the lack of line abreast bonuses places less emphasis on maneuvering. Furthermore, it's quite a bore to just pick off units ones and twos from range with artillery, or even just to line up and shoot at each other with infantry.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pros:
I love the Napoleonic period. The C&C system adds an element of fog of war/chaos. The wooden blocks look great. The rules for forming square are thematic. Units roll fewer dice when they lose blocks (which is a departure from other C&C games).

Cons:
Set up is probably the longest of all the C&C games I have played. There is no "facing" for the units which means that (other than blocking retreats) it makes no difference if a unit is attacked from the front or from behind. The terrain tiles look cheap. There are too many unit types (several different infantry, cavalry and artillery units with different stats). I almost wish there were only one of each unit type like in Battle Cry. Whilst not a complex game, I think it is probably a bit too complex for the otherwise simple C&C system. It is rare that the historical victor doesn't win the battle, which may not be fun for the person playing the losing side.

N.B.
I have upgraded wooden dice.

Recently got my first play in.  I have no prior C&C experience.  Once you get used to the flow of the game, things seem pretty simple.  The only difficult part thus far is remembering all the terrain bonuses.

Gotten this one to the table a few more times.  Again, I can't compare it to any other C&C games but I really like this one (and so does my GF!)

First the complaints:
Takes an awful lot of time before can be played (I'm referring to all the stickering). Then, once you get to play, you notice that it's very difficult to distinguish all the different units from each other. This slows down the game and makes it easier to conduct folly moves. While playing, I also found the reference sheet a rather laborous read, since there are no quick-to-intepret illustrations for range and firepower you've seen in other C&C titles. All this tilts the learning curve unnecessarily.


Then the praise:
Compared to the other C&C titles, this has more tactical depth, thanks to all the new manoeuvres. The new tactics also change the strategies which always gives new challenges to the veterans of the series. And let me assure you, the gameplay is also very entertaining. There are only a handful of other games that provide you with the same amount of meaningful decisions within an action packed hour or two.


Verdict:
Once you get a hang of it, C&C Napoleonics is an excellent game in the light wargame category. However, the shortcomings in the visual presentation prevent it from being truly outstanding. 

The fact that it's too easy to mix up the units with each other puts me off a little. Hence, I do not always want to play C&C Napoleonics but will never turn down a game.

Enough flavour for it to be Napoleonics without too much detail.  Personally, I think some of the old SPI hex games did things better without too much extra chrome, however, this looks better and is glossier and with more expansions and possibilities.  I liked the forming a square rules where you lose a card and I liked the change of firepower as your units diminish.  Other than that, if you have Memoir and are not a specifically a Napoleonics fan over WW2, there is no need to have this too - they are pretty similar.  Above all, this is quite fun and so I would mostly be happy to play it.

The scenarios are highly variable in quality and we keep coming back to Quatre Bras, which is no bad thing in Napoleonics. The playing experience can be very good, but the results of die rolls can be as variable as the scenarios. A 6 rating therefore is midway between 8 & 4, and you may experience the whole range across these battles.

Bought directly from GMT as part of their P500 system, so that I definately get a set and don`t miss this one again! I love the Command and Colors system, and own Memoir 44 (good game but a bit toy-like - lots of excellent expansions) and Ancients (many games played. Superb series). I also own Vive L`Empereur (a good effort but not up to the standard of this game) and Worthington Games offering, "Napoleon's War II: The Gates of Moscow", which is OK but not on a par with this game.

Can't imagine ever being rid of this game.  One of my favorite two player games.  If you've enjoyed Memoir 44 and want to step up the play, then this is a great game.  The additional troop abilities really help add to the overall strategy involved.  While luck from cards and dice rolling can certainly sway the game, it still feels as if the tactics one emplys can make a difference to help mitigate it.

A very light introduction to wargaming...and fun to boot. Gobs of luck, but you can't depend on luck alone; and as opposed to Commands & Colors:Ancients, the luck-level is somewhat reduced. So is it more strategic than its predecessor? Yes. So is it more realistic than its predecessor? Uhh, maybe slightly? You see, while sound strategies are required (and the more experienced player will always have an advantage), the best tactics you use only correspond with those of the actual Napoleonic Wars in a very vague and abstracted sense. In other words, C&C Napoleonics won't teach you a huge amount about how Napoleonic battles were fought; but you will learn about the participants and the basic formations.

But who cares? It really looks nice, and it's a hoot to play! Give me this over Ancients any day!

The best in the Command & Colors series if I had to choose one! CC: Napoleonics has much more rules than its fellow games of the series but that makes it a beter game for me.

Having played not so many war games and mostly lightweight war games like Memoir 44, Napoleonics offered an amazing experience. I like that units are build realistic (unlike Memoir) and the less you have the less they hit, I like that they're specialized, I like the overall balancing of the game and I believe that after 1-2 plays people can almost stop relying on the help sheets to figure out what each type of terrain does and how "bad" is a unit.

The game is short enough to not be overwhelming and to appeal to players who are not only into wargames (such as myself) without leaving the feeling that it it a compromise for light players.

Overall a 8.5, with the possibility of the rating to be revised upwards.

Our first introduction to a block wargame, which is quite a commitment with all the stickering, placing terrain, setting up units using codes, and so forth. That said, when you get down to playing, the rules are fairly simple to comprehend, you play cards and move units in one of three zones on the board, then roll dice for combat. Large number of scenarios right out of the box and even more if you get the four Army expansions, plus there is a fair share of historical accuracy, at least as much as the rules with allow. We will probably buy more for this once we figure out a good storage solution for the blocks.

RATING: 8
Played it a few times, and it seems to be a worthy addition to the C&C line, with another simplified, semi-abstract game that seems to capture the essence of the battlefield tactics of the period.

It's interesting that just a few rules changes and slightly different unit stats manage to produce a game that plays very differently from the Ancients version. The emphasis here is much more on manoeuvre and use of terrain rather than linear tactics. I'm still learning the ropes (and was never that good an Ancients player), and so far I've only played the British, which usually have the tactically easier task of remaining on the defensive. I still can't use the powerful but fragile cavalry well, and to a large extent I fail to appreciate the use of artillery, which would seem to be underpowered (compared to it, rifle infantry look like they're armed with machine guns...) But I'm really enjoying the game so far.

I still prefer the Ancients iteration, but that's only down to period preference, as I think Napoleonics is just as good a game.

PS: I don't know why it's constantly written this way in english, but it's battle of Vimeiro, not Vimiero.

After three plays this seems like the best of the series. It combines the attempt at historical representation from Ancients with a greater diversity in terrain and scenarios. Some additional rules involving artillery and cavalry make the proceedings more interesting and combined arms tactics are a must.

Still kind of a card and dice fest. Also the rules for squares are kind of strangely punishing.

RATING: 9
20 Plays: My personal favorite of the Command and Colors system. Unlike most previous C&C iterations, this game offers asymmetrical abilities for each nation. Proper use of terrain and leaders and supporting units for morale are the mark of a veteran player. This is also the first C&C game to introduce the idea of reduced firepower based on unit cohesion. All in all, the changes introduced provide for an altogether different, thematic feel. 

40 Plays: Still enjoying this system. I've now played all the base scenarios as the French. Each play of a scenario offers different challenges based on which cards you and your opponent have and how the dice treat you. The more successful players will learn to adapt to a situation rather than try to shoehorn the skirmish into their original strategy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Much better than Memoir '44. There's some well-implemented rock-paper-scissors to the combat, which is then randomized by the dice rolling. A cavalry charge, due to the infantry squaring rules, need to be carefully considered. Squaring itself needs to be carefully considered, since it becomes weak to range attacks. While the occasional luck in card draw can decide a match, Napoleonics does reward a player's experience with the system. The outcome of a scenario seems to come down to some combination of (a) who rolled the best; (b) who drew the best; and (c) who moved their pieces in the most alignment with approach/game model of the historical armies. Thus, in view of the limited excitement generated by (a) and (b), the experience of playing out a historical scenario seems to be the star of the show.

The rule book, aside from the terrain player aid, is pretty awful. Luckily, the game itself is relatively simple. Unfortunately -- and this may simply be due to my preferences -- the game has just enough breadth in its rule set and also takes long enough to set up, that I doubt I'd ask to play this over Up Front (assuming my opponent has some familiarity with Up Front) or Napoleon: The Waterloo Campaign.

The most enjoyable of the C&C series that I have played. The mechanics fit the time period, and small tweaks (like "Scout" cards, more terrain, and losing power as you lose blocks) put this head and shoulders above "Ancients".

Very similar to CC:Ancients except with the welcomed rule change that reduced units do not fight as well. I enjoy the game but it probably isn't necessary to have CC:A and CC:Napoleonics.

RATING: 8.6
Despite the fact I don't like Mem44 as a simulation, I wanted to buy the C&C Napoleonic system to try it out and compare it with other Napoleonic games.

My first plays were not very encouraging though. I search for historical analysis in wargames and the good wargames make me read about these battles.

......

I changed the nameless labels into unit ID's that actually fought in the battles. Much better this way.

Without the unit designations the game felt too bland.

Adding unit ID's is a lot of research work, but actually is a lot of fun too. Changing from 7.6 to 8.6 as it gives the game more historical value while still not too realistic enough.

RATING: 10
Ancients, Battle Cry, Memoir... All feel very different from one another and Richard Borg has done it again by creating a Napoleonic battle game using the Commands & Colors systems that is like and yet totally unlike any of his other games. This is a deft blend of Ancients planning and Battle Cry "deadliness" but with unique aspects all its own: Infantry Squares, Combined Arms combat, unique unit and national characteristics. Overall, another big winner for Richard Borg and GMT! *Update:* Bumped it to a 10. More than Ancients, this game infuriates me at every turn. I'm on the cusp of rolling over the enemy line when a First Strike or a Cavalry Bounce breaks my stride. What can I say? I love it!

Update 09-2011: Attacking in this game is a real challenge and requires some patience and effort in slowly applying pressure to the defender while preparing for the final assault. The rock-paper-scissors aspect of the game is a key to good play: Use cavalry against artillery; artillery against infantry; infantry against cavalry. Admittedly, a stationary unit that rolls well in ranged combat can upset your plans, but it happens. The best thing is to stay out of musket range until you're ready to cross that two-hex no man's land! Have a Force March or Bayonet Charge card ready for that time, if you can!

RATING: 7
After one play, I really like it.  Lots of comparisons to Hold the Line, but I think I like everything C&C does more.  The card deck adds a second source of randomness but gives the player greater ability to mitigate it.  OTOH, the card deck gives lots more options for special tactics.  

Beyond that, it's a simple war game.  Multiple units, terrain modifiers, units can move & attack in the same turn (they can't in hold the line), VPs mostly come from killing the other guy's units, slight differences based on nationality of units, and a couple of special formations.  

It's a keeper for now.  Amanda loved it and Jonathan was excited to play it.  I don't love it, but I like it and if they love it, that's enough for me.

Overall, it certainly lives up
to whatever expectations for a lighter wargame.

BUT, it may also be a better simulation than many 
give it credit for. There are some little weird aspects
(like the orders system seems to go in 'the wrong direction' -
from the subordinates to the commander), but I'm not 
convinced that those abstractions are any worse than
what exist in most games. For example, it's a better
simulation of command and control than the standard
'godlike' control often available in wargames.

On the other hand, the handling of squares really irks me.
The whole disincentive of burying cards seems to drive in the wrong direction again.
A commander on the field is not less active, just because some units are pinned down. This is most telling when a small number of squares completely drains your hand. Too, it ignores the additional fragility of units in square, for the most part, when hit with arty. Finally, cav either bounced, caused a few casualties, OR broke the square; the latter effect is simply impossible.

It has finally arrived.  I am looking forward to stickering this and getting it to the table.

After some hours work I have finally finished stickering and bagging the blocks - still trying to get the box lid back on, like Captain Oates, I may be some time.

Update: Played.

The many variations in unit differences make for a game that is a little more obscure than many of the other C&C games - but the payoff is that each army plays quite differently, and that players will want to capitalise on their national strengths and deny the opponent the opportunity to capitalise on theirs.

I like the emphasis in this game on ranged fire, as well as the effectiveness of melee.  The combined arms, square and retreat and reform rules add some real play differences and unit uses to the game.

I like what I have seen so far from this game.

Just a first impression, but after some trepidation about the system, I actually had a lot of fun playing it - there was a lot of back-and-forth attack-and-counter-attack, and I like how the rules for squares and cavalry interact, requiring combined arms. I assume like most C&C it's dependent on good scenarios, but the one we played (Corunna) was pretty good. The quality of C&C:A scenarios definitely seems to have declined with later expansions, hopefully the quality is there for this one.

My god though, this game is a nightmare from the perspective of usability and design. The rulebook is really horrendous, managing to explain simple things half a dozen times and make a straightforward game baroque. The unit charts are similarly over-designed and much more complicated than they need to be while failing to simply convey straightforward information, and the terrain chart is a model of unusability. This is what, like the 5th iteration of this game system, how hard can it be to get it right the 5TH TIME OUT! Especially since C&C:A really wasn't bad, given the complexity and variety of units.

Played a couple of scenarios through on solo. My first board game. Looking to try and find opponents. Cards and dice add an element of luck, maybe too much for some people. Overall, I can see myself enjoying this as a fairly light game connected to a period I am pretty interested in. The cards and dice make for reasonable re-playability. And there is strategy involved in deciding which units to move at which times. Also each nationality and unit have their strengths and weaknesses. And combined attacks, terrain effects and squares etc help add some depth. Looks to be something you could play without having to be a grognard.

So an 8 from this novice.

The best of  the Command & Colors series.  The scenarios are finely crafted puzzles, the game has an uncluttered, beautiful presentation, and the rule set takes on a greater tactical scope and complexity without sacrificing playability.  In fact once you get the charts and tables down after a play or two, you hardly need them.  The terrain sheet is a marvel of clarity and is the only one you really need on hand.

Another in the C&C Series, though it still manages to stay fresh.  Once again, a few major tweaks introduces a whole new strategical approach.  The units seem easier to remember than Ancients though Ancients uses a better marking system.

I have looked forward to this version for many many years and it lives up to the expectation.

Really like the topic.  This may be a tentative rating.  The steeper learning curve may have something to do with it.  Not that I haven't played harder games than this but it sibling CC Ancients just feels right.  It is still to be determined if the extras in this system are worth the effort.  I can see loving this but I can also see hating it.  Need to play more to see if I have that moment where it all comes together for me.

The relatively low complexity of the rules belies the depth of the gameplay of this series. The Nappy C&C entry is easily the best for me - and I'm much more an Ancients gamer than I am a Nappy player. Slight but significant tweaks to the system to reflect the unique aspects of Nappy warfare make all the difference. Trust me, even if you're not a Nappy gamer, you'll want to play this game.

I was sure to fall in love with this game but... it never happened ! I made several attempts for (solo) sessions but I abort after few turns each time. Strange feeling that the game I play has nothing to do with a napoleonic battle, even if my knowledge of this period is very limited. I realized later, by reading reviews from grognards, that I was not the only one.
I don't want to put a rating because I didn't run a full session, even solo !

Yogya express, yet again. Learning the basics, nice Napoleonic tactics and excellent methods in adapting these tactics into the game mechanics. A challenging series that finally incorporate a reduction in attack dice as unit gets damaged. The option of forming up an infantry square is also a welcome in face of powerful cavalry units. This BG quickly becomes our favorite. Make sure you move all units before making any attacks or you WILL regret those cancelled moves.

Commands and Colors System: Squares, artillery, and cavalry charges.  Leaders are less important than in Ancients.  For some reason, I love the green board and the colors of the units.  The artillery seems huge.  I like the squares formation aspect, but it makes for some hard choices sometimes.  I find I do a lot more sitting on hills and firing down in Napoleonics than in Ancients, where movement is somehow more inviting.  I mean, nobody wants to walk right into cannon fire.  Still, cavalry charges can be rewarding.  Again, a beautiful game, physically.  Makes you feel like aristocracy playing it.

RATING: 8
Least fun of similar games; has many modifiers, exceptions, etc. which do not make the game better, but make you consulting charts or rules frequently. However, the series of similar games speaks to me to be able to play a simple, smooth game from time to time; Battlelore, Memoir '44, but also Battle Cry are better in this respect; if I play a game with many modifiers I expect it to have more depth; but also then better games exist. Therefore, I do not understand the higher BGG ranking than Battle Cry; logical in this game is that a unit's battle strength is directly tied to the number of blocks present in the unit.

Card driven war game simulating historical battles from the Napoleonic Wars. Many different types of troops with their own specific abilities. Same basic game mechanism as Memoir '44 but the rules are more complex. Well, this description looks a lot like the one I wrote for Commands and Colors: Ancients... The resemblance with the latter game is even greater than with Memoir '44. Due to the fact that the number of dice you roll also depends on the number of blocks in a unit, and not only on the type of unit and terrain or card specific modifiers, you have to constantly consult the number of dice to roll-charts. This implies that play is less fluid than in the Ancients game. It's one more step in the direction of heavy, chart filled war games.

RATING: 8
I play the game solitaire, for which it’s not primarily intended, and I love it.  What is lost in hand management is gained in the way the cards restrict options for each side; this actually enhances solo play.  (Just make sure to leave opposing “First Strike” cards showing, so you remember to play them.)  In fact, I prefer soloing card games more than many conventional two-player games for this reason.   

Don’t be deterred by the 24 pp. of rules, they are complete to a near-fault - packed with examples and explanations, with many exceptions laid out, and perfectly organized. The visuals are wonderful: the board, terrain tiles and colorful blocks create diorama-like appeal; the cards are lovely too. There’s plenty of battles included, and they play quick.  Most are well-balanced, with victory often a near-run thing.  

All this should catch the eye of newcomers, and this battle-tested system would be a fine entry to the hobby.  It’s also a nice break from more detailed fare.  I’ve picked up some of the expansions too!

What the?!  They took a game and made it worse.  Yes, you might as well just put your leaders by the edge of the board and let them retreat off of it.  First, I think MEM44 sucks.  Then they try to fix a bunch of flaws in this version.  Ok. almost there..now let's see ... ah yes, put a stupid retarded leader that does exactly zero in the middle of everything!  There that will mess everything up!  What's wrong with this game designer?!

RATING: 2
Gag. Very annoying. This game takes a nice, simple system and overloads it. For what it delivers--not even a cartoon of a Napoleonic battle--there are far too many rules and things to remember. There are all kinds of rules for heavy this and light that, and combined arms yada yada, and square formation, and on and on. It all looks pretty cool with neat blocks and colorful drawings. But if none of it models the real thing in any recognizable way, then what is the point of all those rules? If I'm to have more rules, I want more historical feel. The Ancients version of this system strikes the balance well for me. This version not so much. For virtually no more effort (say, with Eagles of the Empire), you can get a ton more history. Damn, try SPI's old Ney v. Wellington for cripe's sake. It just isn't much more involved.

Players play either the Allies (British/Portuguese) or the French and fight out Napoleonic battles, mainly in Spain and Portugal.  Next iteration of the Commands & Colours system, where players play a command card, and follow the instructions.  Typically units are activated to move and/or battle, trying to wipe out opposing units or take important terrain features.  These award victory banners, take enough of these and you win the game.  This seems a step up in complexity from the excellent Ancients games, with a lot of it based on the different unit types combined with nationality differences.  Also new stuff to learn such as infantry squares, combined arms attacks, and so on.  Probably take about 5 games to get comfortable with the unit mix, but signs are good.  Production a bit sloppy - the French and Portuguese colour blocks are too similar under artificial light.

I have now played Samurai Battles, and i think this is significantly better. My decisions seem to have more impact on the game here than in SB. Despite its questionable historicity the game does having something to say about Napoleonic era tactics. Your cannons are really your play maker pieces, especially when used in combined arms, or at close range, and your cavalry are you pinning pieces, this is more or less in line with the military thought of the time and does create exciting game play.


---------------------------------------------------
This is the only game of the system i've played. Its great fun, but it is quite random for the level of detail in the rules. Ultimately the dice and cards have more to say about the result than your decisions. Assuming both players understand the basic tactics of pinning infantry, combining arms, and attacking en mass etc. You can't really do strategy in this game. You can't try a pincer movement or left hook, because you cannot be sure to get the necessary cards.

Having said all this, it is a lot of fun if you don't take it too seriously. A good light end war themed game. I look forward to the expansions

Take the unit variations of Ancients and combine it with the terrain modifiers of M'44 and you've got C&C:N. But make no mistake, the tactics and strategies make this its own unique game. Lots of tough choices and challenging scenarios. New wrinkles like combined arms and squares mirror the era well. (Purists will bemoan the lack of facing, but you'll not get that in a 1 hour game.) First couple of games will be tedious as you check nationality charts, terrain tables and the rule book for every move. But, like Ancients, it starts to click. (BTW, the charts are fine once you know how to use them.) Different styles of play will vary the game length greatly. 

Update: This game rocks. Is it too soon to beg for the Epic version?

This doesn't do it for me, I still think CC Ancients is the best in the series, but I wouldn't turn down a game if offered. It is not a bad game, but I find it a bit overly complicated. Maybe I am just not a fan of this prediod, 

Emphasis is on Fire combat that is powerfull and there are some cards that I find simply tasteless (particularly charging into hand to hand combat outside of enemy fire range). Power of some cards and losses reducing combat strength make this feel more luck dependent than CC Ancients.

This is a marked improvement to C&C:A, or any of the C&C family. Probably the best I've played. The tweaks make the game more sensible now. Attack dice is now based on unit strength. Infantry ability to form squares now make use of cavalry more sensible and more considered, where previously cavalry would run all over the board picking off stray units. Scenarios seem more sensible too. No more 5-0 blowouts typical in C&C:A. 

It's still C&C so expect some cards and dice randomness to determine the outcome of the game, but game duration is still manageable for this kind of randomness.

I have only played twice, but this game does an excellent job in demonstrating and encouraging tactics that make appropriate use of the capabilities of the different types of units (infantry, cavalry and artillery.)

On the other hand, having the right card at the right time can be a huge advantage, so at least among beginners, there's quite a bit of luck in the card draws.  I'm not sure the scenarios are all balanced, either.

Edit: After quite a lot (30+) solo games I completely changed my mind. Fiddlyness is reduced to a minimum when using better charts. Game is incredibly fast and attacking so dangerous, that cautious play is nececery whitch reduces the gambling yazzee- factor to a point, that it only boosts the high tension.

After first 2 plays I´m a little bit dissapointed. Game is not too fiddly (I am definatly not the ASL kinda guy) but too fiddly for the little depth it has. Maybe my rating will rise when I get used to the dice calculations,

Takes the welcome additions to the C&C system started in the Ancients game and adds one new mechanic that I have been waiting for - units now fire variable number of dice depending on how many blocks are left.  I have always felt it was a bit unthematic for a 1 block unit to still have the same effect on the battle as a full 4 block unit.  The production is nice, very similar to GMT's ancients production.  The blocks are a bit bigger this time around.

Another variant of the Commands & Colours games system now operating successfully in Acients, Fantasy, WWII and now, possibley even more successfully, Napoleonics. The rules are lagely the same as it's predecessors with small tweaks to add the flavour and feel of battles in the Napoleonic period - the "squares" rule, although abstract works well and unit attrition is reflected in reduced firepower.

Now even better with the addition of tactics cards that add additional fog of war, tactics (oh d'her!) and flavour. 

All game components are excellent but, as usual, be prepared for lots of sticker application to the blocks - the art on the stickers is very good. My favourite light wargame.

Better than the Ancients game, yet it is still a highly random affair and its fun factor comes from rolling buckets of dice. Yet I prefer this to any other previous incarnation of the system.

Having some interest in Napoleonics and being such a big fan of C&C: Ancients, I had high expectations for this game and was surprised to find myself a bit disappointed. There's no doubt it conveys its subject well and I'm very pleased that it plays so differently to Ancients, but most of the featured changes to the system actually seem to promote slower, more cautious, less dynamic play. Leaders have less tactical importance; the dice reduction with block loss, the vulnerability of infantry and predominance of terrain seem to favour defense and discourage attacks; and the deck has more constrained ordering options. I look forward to the inevitable development of the system with expansions and I know that there is depth of strategy to be explored, but I'm concerned I'll never reach that point when, given a choice of what to play, I would always prefer Ancients.

Edit January 2014: Risen in rating. As more expansions have come out, the system has matured, and I'm enjoying it, although I still can't see it topping Ancients for me, not only for historical interest, but for play. The additional mechanics and national unit differentiation add great value to Napoleonics but still lose something of the clean, elegant dynamic of Ancients, which is where I think the C&C system achieved near perfection. I'm still very much enjoying Napoleonics and looking forward to its coming Epic format.

RATING: 9
Even though I don't care much for the era represented, the game-play is great, and it feels like I'm commanding a Napoleonic army. The main downside is that the copious terrain means I need to do a lot of looking up when planning/executing a turn, but I imagine that will get a lot better when I've played a few games.

Edit: notched down to a 9, because I'd rather play CC Ancients in nearly every case. I just prefer the relative simplicity of the latter. CC Napoleonics is still one of the best games I've played, though.

UPDATE: The Austrian expansion have several good scenarios with new creative victory conditions. Excellent stuff.

------------------

UPDATE: 13 battles and I see the beauty of the system. Good cards, and if you take your time it works. Played both Salamanca battles and it was great fun. This game now outranks both M44 and CCA for me. Will get all expansions. A game typically takes 20-21 turns.

------------------

UPDATE: After three battles, I am slowly getting the hang of it. Love the rocks/scissors/paper style of combat. I recommend trying the River Coa Battle, it has a nice escape situation, horse artillery, two rifle infantry and feels balanced. Brits won 6-5 after taking out three french and escaping with three units. Fun!

-------------------------------------

Like what I see so far. In many ways it feels like the best version yet, with cannons less all-mighty than in M44. Light cavalry can charge three hexes, just from out of range from all light infantry, except rifle infantry. This rewards careful play, though obviously still very random. Leaders are much weaker than in Ancients, but still useful, IMO. The board easily rips apart when you fold it out, though. I had to repair mine.

Yes, this is the one.
I have had minor to moderate misgivings about all of the C&C games, and I previously preferred Battlelore for its insistence on formation and its nifty Lore. 
My heart, however, will always belong to the Napoleonic Wars, and so naturally I prefer this version. The combined arms is not terribly well implemented, but the unit differentiation is very nifty. 
I can't wait to play more.

The Napoleonic subject matter has made it approximately 17 times better than Memoir '44. All the rules on morale, squares, taking ground, retreat/reform, leaders, support, mixed arms etc all add wonderfully.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Okay: Tactical  - Napoleonics - Easy

Plus:
-Very thematic
-Each army has their own characteristics
-Fixes the two biggest gripes I had with Memoir: 
1)If you lose blocks, you lose dice!
2)Battle back with melee
-Calvary rules are excellent and the tactical feel for warfare in this period is good

Minus:
-My issue with the Borg system is the -at times- devastating dice / card combination. Many scenario played was decided by a great hand and a good roll (Fortunately Epics is evening out the huge swings). 
-Not evocative, especially larger battles on original map (ridiculous actually)
-Scale feels wrong; I can imagine it to be tactical as part of a battle. Representing a whole battle is silly.
-Leaders are extremely weak, you would not miss them if they were not present (expansion Leaders  & Marshals fixes this)
-1 hex movement Infantry is frustratingly slow and it takes long before you are in position. 
IMO there should be a column & line formation rules; they have squares so line 1 movement point, column 2 movement points. 
-Original Board way to small imo (Epic fixes this) 

So C&C Napoleonics original for me a 5 but with the Epic and Leaders expansions, it becomes an 8.
The 1 hex movement for infantry still a worry but with column / line formation house rules, column 2 movement points no firing, line, 1 movement firing (or something of that stretch). 

Re-aquirin now.

If you are familiar With Memoir 44, you will recognize the same system for activation of units in 3 different sections as well as the tactics cards.

Slightly more complex than Memoir'44. This game is perfect as an entry level wargame.

Going from Battle Cry to this game, I was expecting to pick it up right away. Quite the contrary. After a few games, I was still learning the more complex battling system, and I lost all of the games I have played so far. So why a 9? Because it's THAT good! If I owned this game, it could potentially take over Battle Cry and 1775 as my top game of choice!

UPDATE: I am now a proud owner. Played my first game last night. I had forgotten some of the rules because it has been almost a year. Still didn't diminish my overall experience.

SECOND UPDATE: Hasn't hit the table in over a year. I still very much love this game, but I'm willing to part with it for a decent trade offer.

RATING: 6
After one play (first scenario) so this rating obviously has room to move up or down quite a bit if I ever play this more. (I do not own the game, played with a mate who is a massive CC:A fan.) The only other game in this "family" I've played are two sessions of Memoir '44.

My thoughts:
- Feels like a ton of setup. (I'm coming from games like Hannibal, CC:E, Napoleon's Triumph, Paths of Glory.)
- First scenario has a lot of terrain and unit types. A little bit overwhelming for people trying to play it for the very first time.
- Why don't the Horse Artillery have a horse in the picture?
- In the first scenario the British have, historically, a 3:2 numerical advantage but it isn't clear to me how they can use that in the game. 5 flags for either side wins it. Dunno yet how well the game handles recreating "hordes vs. elite troops" kind of scenarios.
- We both felt like there was a no-mans'-land in the middle. Whoever risked moving in there first was in for a world of hurt. Would require more plays to see how persistent/real that problem is.

Not my thoughts: my playing partner kept remarking on how many exceptions for unit types and terrain there are. (Remember he's coming from a CC:A background.)

The Commands and Colors system has had very little modification in the transition to the Napoloeonic Era and it really does show. The slightly chaotic if rather charming feel of the Ancients translates into gross unrealism in the 19th century. This really is an abstract game with a military theme pasted on, it's not a wargame in any sense that attempts to model the reality of the period being represented. C&C was never a strong system to begin with, this incarnation is just making things worse.

RATING: 10
Thankfully Commands & Colors: Napoleonics is not just C & C: Ancients with Napoleonic stickers. Key changes and additions to the original C&C:Ancients rules radically change the tactical situation. Range fire is far more deadly in Napoleonics. The standard Ancients tactic of moving medium and heavy infantry units adjacent to enemy units to melee does not work very well against 4 and 5 dice ranged attacks, especially when each die now has two infantry symbols! 
Infantry can form squares against calvary attack, reducing cavalry attack dice to one. The trade off is that units in a square can only attack or battle back with one die. Furthermore, noncavalry units can still attack units in a square without a reduction in attack dice and units cannot come out of a square if they are adjacent to an enemy cavalry unit. Consequently, I've found that the disadvantages of squares tend to outweigh the advantages. Squares work best as a last resort for weakened infantry units against cavalry. 
Artillery fire is adjusted by range, and can be combined with infantry or calvary melee attacks. 
While capturing the overall flavor of Napoleonic era warfare, this game is not an in-depth simulation. Hardcore wargamers interested in a detailed treatment of Napoleonic warfare should look elsewhere. 
I gave this game a 10 because it captures the flavor of Napoleonic warfare without getting bogged down in detail, and, more importantly, it's fun.

Based on one solo play only, I like it. 

It's certainly a step up from M44, the C&C game I've played the most, both in terms of the gameplay and the historical feel. 

Due to the battleback rule ported from C&C:A there's no standing next to a unit that's attacking you and doing nothing about it due to lack of cards. Infantry squares, cavalry charges (they're pretty much acting as armour in M44) and reduced unit effectiveness as casualties are taken all improve the experience.

"Each C&C game is played very differently. With Ancients, the overall firepower is weak (but nasty)and the core of battle is the close combat. Typically, everyone lines up nicely - then everything goes to hell - then the survivors line up for another go. In my opinion, it shows ancient tactics well.

Now Napoleonics is a horse of another colour. Here firepower is deadly and just charging in is a quick way to lose. Cavalry 'can' be decisive against weak and isolated units when launched into the attack at the right time. The game plays more as a chess game and it often takes longer due to players discarding poor cards and creating a good 'one-two punch' combination."

RATING: 4
I thought the scenarios were disappointing and the graphic design substandard.  I'm tired of Richard Borg's lackluster scenarios which fail to allocate a burden of the attack and reward the player who has more artillery to snipe with.  After 5 Commands & Colors releases, things should be better than this.  Playing the same dog of a scenario twice in a row doesn't make it more fun, even if it provides a yardstick for player performance.

The game system itself makes attacking difficult without having the right tactics cards - a bigger hand seems more important here than in some of the other C&C games.  

The blocks are not laid out well at all - black print on a dark blue background for all three types of infantry?  GMT should know better than this.  Horse artillery without a horse on the counter?  I'm docking the game a full point here for not taking advantage of the little advantages color and readable text could bring.

A harsh review, but I thought this a weak effort.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Didn't like it very much at first go.  Thought the game placed too much emphasis on drawing powerful cards which break the otherwise defender-friendly system.  I'm also tired of C&C scenarios which don't have a time limit mechanic to force the attacker to push ahead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I've owned and played most of the C&C games, and Napoleonics is right up there with Ancients for me. It's a half-step more complex than its brother: while the units in the base game are less prone to the exceptions that riddle Ancients, the complexity rises when you factor in the extensive amount of terrain and the at least initial puzzle of how to engage the enemy without getting your strength vitiated (as in this game combat effectiveness is directly tied to the number of blocks in a given unit). Presentation wise, C&C:N is for me superior to Ancients, with the striking block colors (particularly of the British and French) and the numerous terrain pieces laid against a green background. If you don't like the general C&C approach, this game won't change your mind, but for C&C fans and those with an open mind, Napoleonics offers a rich tactical experience in a relatively economical game time.

While I haven't played CC:A in awhile and therefore am underqualified to compare this with it, CC:N is a fantastic addition to the series. The scenarios are extensive enough to keep you going for months, and the production values are, if anything, better than most other GMT games. (Is it just me, though, or do the scenario notes have a bit less in the strategic analysis department than in CC:A?)

As one might expect, this game puts emphasis on ranged attacks and even a little combined arms, though using combined arms effectively can be very hard to pull off. One thing I find surprising is how ineffective artillery is at any distance - this seems counterintuitive to me, but I don't know much about the accuracy of cannon at the time. I like that there are grenadiers and both young and old guard in the game, and I only wish they showed up more often! 

Altogether, a very entertaining way to spend 45-60 minutes.

I have still same objections like I had with prior games in this series. I hate when you are stuck with cards which does not allow you for example to activate your strongest part of army or fact that you start well somewhere and than your cards dry out, your army stops in middle of plain and gets slaughtered by artillery because you do not have cards to do anything about that.

I have heard arguments of fans and supporters but I cannot buy into such explanations.

I must confess that presentaion is nice, there is also try to differentiate more troops based on nationality, etc... I will probably check Medieval game when it cames out, although I do not expect that it will become my favorite system.

Nice revision of C&C -series. Infantry is far more fragile and this combined with hits reducing combat effectiviness makes this considerably different from C&C Ancients or Battlelore or Memoir. I like how different nations have different specialities instead of identical units. There is also lot more terrain in battlefields which is nice, when compared to C&C:A. When infantry is so much more fragile and there is more terrain and setups are far from even, it becomes more like a puzzle on how to unravel your enemy's defence.

Considerable fun on first play, seems worth further exploration--it will take some time to master this. Simple mechanisms but manages to generate a lot of subtle differentiations. Aesthetically irresistible. Even though I am no miniatures gamer I already crave orange-block Dutch and Nassau units for the Waterloo scenarios.

{later}

After half a dozen plays it's still fun and seems clever, but some aspects aren't feeling a bit too ahistorical for real comfort, particularly with respect to force-to-space issues. But I look forward to trying the expansions to come.

January 2015 update.  I'm liking this more after playing the River Coa scenario, which forces the French player to attack to prevent the British from winning by exiting troops.  This speeds up the game considerably and adds a lot of tension as both sides only get 4 cards in their hand, so the possibility of not getting the cards in the sector you need to order is enhanced.  

Further update after more play.  Attacking really exposes you to losses in this game, so the scenarios need a reason for someone to move.  Otherwise, it degenerates into a long range artillery duel until someone gets bored enough to attack.  We'll have to try home rules for victory flag hexes to see if that makes it more interesting.

Update after additional play.  Raised this to a nine.  Very fun.  Different enough from BattleLore and CC:A to be interesting.  Nice light take on Napoleonic battles.

Initial rating based on two plays of the first scenario.

Excellent implementation of the Command and Colors system.  Each nationality has unique units yet with the player aid charts it's easy to keep track of them.  

The game plays very quickly.  It's easy enough to teach new wargamers yet has enough depth to satisfy experienced players.

The GMT facebook firesale discount led me to believe maybe I should get this one.  Although Napoleonics period is not one of the must-have to me, the colorful uniform of the period attracts a lot of appetite for games related to this period.  CC:N is familiar to all who have already played the Borg's system of CDG.  The system is effective, functional, though it still gives a strong sense of being a game only.  The gamey feel is all around during play.  There is not much sense of accomplishment in terms of historicity after completing a game of CC:A.  The strength of the system is its simplicity to distinguish units types and characteristics.  Quick to get in and then get out, scenarios can always be completed under two hours. (Note: Played 6 out of the total 15 scenarios so far.)

I've had far too many dull or just plain weird games to be convinced by this game no matter how much I want to like it. While Ancients has a fun element and is as chaotic as you'd imagine ancient combat to be this just doesn't work; when playing the French I'm often far too paranoid to attack and the game can take an age waiting for key cards. Plus when you get to the point you're losing say 5 - 0 but then win 5 - 6 due to the bahaviour in one memorable case, with just one light cavalry unit then you know something is really, really wrong.

RATING: 9.9
brilliant short wargame ; much more tactics and strategy in comparison with memoir '44 
very high replayability ; different landscapes, different units, different cards and... different scenarios ! 
Every game is a  mix of these variables and offers a wildly different game experience.

Enjoyable game. With the cards, you can make some sort of blitz krieg, with unexpected moves. Always suspense.
The luck in the game is tolerable because of the short play time (1h-1h30) ... in most cases it's always the same gamer who is winning. So skill does play a significant role.

update after 15 plays
the art in this game is to manage the luck in your advantage.  Luck is a only a minor factor if you make a 'majority' attack. 
The card limitation  reflects the partial and situational control on the battlefield very well
most variable wargame I ever played. 
After 15 plays I've only explored the 7th scenario !
much better than memoir 44 which is a bit too simplistic

9  -> 9.5  -> 9.9

[1 Play] At first, when this game was announced, I thought: "O brother...Borg is sure milking this system." After playing it, I can see that he is actually doing a good job of evolving the system into a more complex war-game. This is probably the best combat simulation of all of the iterations of C&C. It is bloody and decisive. My initial rating of 7 will most likely go up, with more exploration. Not sure if I need to own this game yet.

Revised (March 2016): I am in. I bought a copy of the base game and the Spanish and Russian Expansions. I have come to the conclusion that this is the C&C system in a perfected form. Changed my rating from 8 to 10.

What a wonderful game, a bit more complex than CCA but the Napoleonic period was a study in warfare in transition. My rating is based on production quality alone. The secenarios have more terrian on average than CCA which will be interesting, I'm going to get lots of milage out of this series.

RATING: 7
I really wanted to like this game, `cause I´m a big fan of this game system, but...
-It is too complicated, too many rules and things to remember. --Too many different units with too many different abilities and it is very hard to see which is which. 
-Horse artillery, but no horse pictured????
-If you attack, you`ll very likely lose.
I`m sorry, but I think that this game is worst of the CC-family, so I`ll stick with BattleLore...
But I still give it 7, `cause I like the genre so much.

Well designed game that adds a lot of solid Napoleonic flavour to the C&C sytem. My rating reflects C&C overload more than fun - I find M44 and CCA more interested and so see less reason to play this. But if you're a Napoloenics or C&C fanatic, very much worth your time.

09/01/12 Played scenario #2, once. Due to the added complexity of this game system over Battle Cry or Memoir '44 one has to constantly flip through about six charts. Unlike Battle Cry and Memoir where a particular unit type, say infantry, moves and fires the same, no matter its national origin, that isn't so in C&C: Napoleonics. All the sub-unit types (e.g. foot artillery, horse artillery, guard artillery) have differences in movement rates and firing. That really slowed things down. Plus the general pace of this game is *much* slower than its two cousins I'm used to. Generally speaking most Battle Cry and Memoir '44 scenarios can be completed in 25 to 40 minutes. Not here. Today's game took 2.3 hours!

My opinion before I played was GMT made a big mistake going with wooden blocks. To me wooden blocks are really for games with "fog of war" like most of Columbia Games' titles. GMT should have used plastic figurines in this game, or after seeing the modifiers for all the unit types they should have used cardboard counters where some or all of those modifiers could have been depicted on the counter. After playing the game my opinion holds. The blocks aren't terrible, but there are better solutions. Its like using a nail when a screw is more appropriate.   

Everything was logical and historical as to the unit differences, but its a pain to have to constantly look them up on a chart. Once again its not terrible, but I can do with less complexity than this. I thought the cards were fine. The method and penalties for having an infantry unit form into a square are well thought out, but have to be considered carefully each time one's infantry is attacked. Once again adding time to the game.  

I had some problem telling the line infantry from the light infantry. I felt there wasn't enough contrast as they printed the words in black on a blue field on the block stickers. They did much better with the cavalry's black on yellow and the artillery's white on red.  The generals seem rather lame. The terrain hexes are too thin, but the artwork on them was good. Well, except for the forest hexes, which looked like an overhead view of an orderly orchard. Also, as the die faces are not recessed ala Battle Cry, so the stickers were already trying to peel off. The owner also showed me how there's no way all the game components will fit back in the box. He had to carry a second box, which he completely filled with blocks. That's just... insane. 

Overall I think C&C:N is a noble effort. I am willing to play it again (but not too often). But I'd never buy it. Its more complex that what I prefer and it takes waaaaay too long to play.

Another well-done Borg design, this one addresses unit strength on # of dice rolled.

One play but great fun so far.  Nice variation on the C&C:A game.  The changes, such as increased ranged effectiveness and decreasing unit strength with number of lost blocks, feels right for the era.  A bit more to digest before the first game, but flowed decently after that.  Looking forward to playing some more battles, and the rating may go higher.

1 Play, March 2013: Hot damn, for a supposedly lighter take on wargames, this game had me and my coworker scrambling to constantly look up stats on the player aids! I really, really like the options available and the way the different units all do things differently but remembering all the things like cavalry bonus attack and artillery support and units don't have to retreat if two friendly units are adjacent...... made my head spin a bit. The constant looking up of the rules made this game a bit too much. 

End of the day, great game and I'll have to see if it sticks around (if my wife will like it). I don't know, I think it's a great system but 1812 and 1775 both do the "attack the other" thing really well and much, much simpler. 

Perhaps it felt a bit much because I did the first scenario which felt like quite a lot of work for not so amazing units. Further scenarios will use stuff like heavy cavalry and guard units, which would make things much more strategic. I'm still thinking about this game one day later, so that's a good sign!

*April 2013* Unfortunately, it was a game that wouldn't see much play. I'm not so into tactical games. This is an excellent game but to me, wasn't worth the money. If I was into purely tactical games, it would get a 10

*March 2015* Bought this again after Battlelore 2nd Ed convinced me I can like this system. Hot dog, do I like this game. Tough one to intro to newbs (BL isn't going anywhere) but this one is like Chess but fun and thematic!

The main reason my rating is at "usually ready to play it" level is the convenient length of the scenarios I have played so far. Always finished in around 2 hours so very playable. This game manages to convey a pretty good simulation of Napoleonic warfare in what is actually a pretty simple set of rules. The competitive aspect is uppermost here though. Games are always tense, exciting and violent. Great fun. Changed rating to 6. This is actually a bit simple for me and my usual opponent. Can't see it hitting the table very often actually. Used this to introduce Lawson to Wargames then gave it to him.

I like the Command & Colors system. I can play and have fun and have a lighter, less brain taxing and faster moving game experience. I don’t have to work at it as in more complex war games which I do like on occasion but have less time and tolerance for nowadays.  I would absolutely recommend C&C Napoleonics as a great game to introduce new gamers into the world of war gaming. It looks great with very nice artwork, plays simply with understandable and very playable rules and is just plain fun. This game will get a lot of table time in my house. The weaknesses for me are down to personal preferences – The terrain tiles are simply not thick and heavy enough and too easily knocked around. I would have preferred more scenarios, if not in the basic package, then freely available from GMT’s website. Also, I like the use of tiles but for me miniatures would have been even nicer. Having said this, C&C Napoleonics is easily one of my current favorite games to play.

RATING: 9.5
Latest in the C&C range and, in my opinion, the best of the lot. It will probably not please the Napoleonic purist and cater for every nuance of this type of warfare, but, in my opinion, you couldn't hope for a more realistic effect with such a simple and elegant set of rules.

My favourite Commands & Colors system, it is a "Memoir 44 upgraded" to me.
Unlike M44, the strategy is more depth in this one and more realistic imo (for example, a wounded unit lose fighting strentgh, moving a unit makes it less strong too...)

Still upset to the fact that cavalry can't shoot despite having guns but if it's the only flaw I can live with that.

As a miniatures gamer who has usually taken the approach that miniatures are for tactical games and boardgames are for strategic games (I have tried and disliked Battlelore and memoir 44）I was very pleasantly surprised to find that this game was a lot of fun.

C&C:N is a fun little light wargame that offers a wealth of challenging tactical choices and is complimented by very well thought-out rules and some great pieces.

If possible, I hope to get a chum to purchase this on my behalf at Cancon and look forward to seeing how the Austrian play when their expansion is released.

Well worth a try if you get the chance. 

UPDATE 

Have decided to 'buy in' to this game system and purchased the Spanish expansion - will alos pick up the others (Austrian, Russian & Prussian).

C&C: Napoleonics has some interesting changes from its sister game C&C: Ancients.  For example, in Nappy, you roll fewer dice as you take casualties and terrain is more important.  There are also rules for national/unit advantages, calvary retire & reform, infantry squares, and combined arms.

Infantry squares are a tough nut to crack.  In my first game, I did a calvary charge with two units on a Portugese line infantry unit.  My opponent announced he was going to form a square.  (To form a square, you have to randomly give up a command card and put it on a track.  You get it back when your unit moves out of square but it takes a command card to do so).  Anyway, the square reduced my roll to just one die and the defender gets to roll one before the attacker. 

Also, I noticed that the center section of the map is larger than the wings.  IIRC, the three sections in Ancients are the same width in hexes.  

The one thing I do not like about the system is when your hand of cards are all in the same section where you have no or few units.  You can't discard in the game so you are stuck.  Meanwhile you are getting pounded in another section with no ability to react.

Overall, I like Nappy and I like the system but I will not get it.  Despite the changes, it still feels like a C&C game and I already have Ancients plus four expansions that don't see the table too much.

Having variable dice depending on the strength of your unit does more harm than good here. One bad set of rolls can send your whole army into a death spiral. After three scenarios, I'm just not feeling the need to try again, which is too bad because this sounded like a great step in between M44 and C&C:A.

I would like to rate this higher, but the number of modifiers you have to take into account every turn really bogs things down, and makes me appreciate the simplicity of Memoir '44. It's a good thing C&C: Napoleonics comes with so many fine playing aids; you'll be spending the whole game with your nose buried in them. 
Minus one die for the terrain, plus one for the unit type, minus one for this, plus one for that, etc.

This is a really great game. Quick to get into and fast playing. I like the unit differences and how the French need to come to grips with the enemy to be effective and how the British want to stand off and have fire combat. My only problem is that sometimes my opponents spend more time building the ideal hand rather than fighting. Woe be tide to anyone out in the open when the French Heavy Cavalry hit though!

It seems to be a bit heavier than Ancients as there's lots of diffrent terrain features and not as forgiving of mistakes. Where in one game you can do some crazy things with even one-block units, its quite another story in the Napoleonics. You have to make sure you have reinforcement ready if things go awry, wild charges with 1 unit usualy end bad and you really want to prepare your attack. While most people don't seem to appriciate it, to me it seems quite authentic and exciting. I've had some nice fights over villages where it goes from one player to the next over several charges and counter-charges. I've seen two lines shoot each-other to pieces. Concentrated cavalry charges that rip though infantry and squares repuplsing said charges. Overall very good napoleonic game that can be played in an hour per scenario (setup is a bit tedious as there's a lot of terrain in most scenarios).

Have been wanting to try this game for a while and I am glad I finally did. For those who know Memoir 44, the mechanics are fairly similar. The board is divided into sections and you play cards to order troops in certain sections. However the number of unit in a section effect it's strength and the is more strategy since your attack is modified based on whether you move and attack, or hold ground and attack. Also, there are more unit types, which add to the complexity. Given all this, it is not hard to grasp the mechanics, but the strategy is definitely a welcome step up (although I do love Memoir 44 as well).

This game is definitely not my cup of tea. The concept is extremely easy and limited: play one card, attack the enemy, then the other player makes the same. This could be ok if the game would flow. Now, every kind of unit has his own parameters and every terrain has a lot of modifiers to check. Ugh! All the time you have to check tables on tables, and in the end you have to throw a lot of dice hoping to obtain a good result. Stupid.
Good news are all the extra rules (square, battleback, retire and reform) nicely designed.  The wide range of scenarios available is another good feature.

The components themselves are nice enough, but the artwork is pretty cheap. This is the same system found in Memoir 44. I think that's the better game, but this one is certainly quite popular. One difference is that this has leaders, which are interesting, gameplay wise. Like Memoir 44, the setup time for this is a bit high

RATING: 8
Fast-playing game that lets you finish a battle in under 90 minutes.  My brother and I were able to play two scenarios  in about four hours (that includes setting up the board and reading the rules).

There is a reasonable amount of "chrome" that allows you to get a feel for the strengths and weaknesses of the three combat arms (infantry, cavalry and artillery).  One quibble we both had was that the ability of the infantry to form square was too much of a sure thing.

The order cards can certainly be frustrating when you don't have anything that lets you order the troops in the sector you need to attack/defend. That is one of the attractions of this family of games since it simulates the fog of war by hampering the player's ability to order units. 

The production values are decent.  The mounted map is on a thick board although I split the back paper hinge when getting the map to lay flat.  On the down-side, I hate that the dice use stickers rather than permanently applied markings. (It took me 60 seconds on the internet to find a company that makes custom dice and am really disappointed GMT did not see fit to supply better dice).

A perfect fit with the big three: infantry, cavalry and artillery! Suits the period really well, as did Battle Cry. A bit more to it than Ancients, but somehow less fun - even though it feels less "gamey" with the unit reduction = dice reduction. Will need to play more.

Update: I think the problem is I don't particularly find ranged combat in tactical games interesting. I don't suffer from dice rage playing Ancients, but I did here. Dispiriting to see units crushed before they clash steel. Prefer Ancients - but since that gets so little play, couldn't justify this and sold it.

Excellent game. The Command & Colors combat system has been elegantly modified to give a very good feel for the period. Players are provided with rules from forming infantry squares and using artillery support, as well as subtle national differences between units of the same type--all without cluttering up gameplay or adding excessive complexity. The rules are clear and well-written, and the player aids are very useful. The components (mounted gameboard, terrain tiles, blocks) are nicely done, and while sticking the units stickers on the blocks is never much fun, it's all well worth the effort.

I bought this after enjoying C&C ancients; this is a more involved game which takes about 50% longer to play. I like the greater complexity, though (others may not - the system feels a little less "clean"), and the lines of blue and red blocks are evocative of old battlefield diagrams. I can see myself hoovering up the expansions for this!

Hopefully soon!

RATING: 9
Fun and fast paced light tactical "wargame" based on the same Richard Borg's system as Memoir or C&C:Ancients. This game is not be taken as an accurate wargame or historical representation, rather as the base system's modification to the Napoleonic era with some historical insight. Another level of rules and unit special abilities adds a lot to the game compared to the other games in series and makes it a bit more a gamer's game. There is still a lot of luck in the card draw and dice throws but it should taken as a light game, not cry about unlucky dice rolls. After a couple of plays of the game each scenario takes about 60 minutes which is about the right time compared the weight and luck of the game. There is more than meets the eye and under the layer.  There is definitely some subtle tactics involved in this game that is not obvious from the beginning. 

It's always fun to play C&C: Napoleonics. 
edit. The tactical play of this game is much deeper than it seems on the surface. There is truly more skill needed in this game than most people seem to agree. Especially the hand management aspect compared to the situation on the board is greatly overlooked by many players.

I had  only played C&C:Ancients before this, but I suspect this is the apotheosis of the C&C system. The need to use combined arms give the players a lot to think about: it takes quite a lot of preparation to set up a successful offensive, but when it works, it is extremely satisfying and highly dramatic. In particular, I like the way the scout cards help you control your hand; indeed, the mix of cards in general was somehow more interesting than in Ancients. At the same time, the game is simply incredibly fun and often characterised by exciting swings of fortune.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
One of the more complicated iterations of the Commands & Colors system. 

Manoeuvering plays a big role in this game: The French need to get in a position to bring their +1 die in close combat to bear, while the English have to try and catch their opponent in a crossfire of +1 ranged.

Careful hand management is even more important here than in other C&C games, since positioning your units is so important. However, in my experience, players take their time to build up a hand in which they can follow up different cards to benefit their actions in one section (at least more so than in the other C&C titles I've  played).

The diversity of the different units makes you use them more carefully, but also means frequent downtime while looking them up on the summary sheet.

I like this game because I feel I still have a lot to learn about the best tactics.

This game is part of the C&C system and looks very similar with the blocks and 3 sectional mapboard.  The game play is completely different than Ancients though, and if you play like the Ancients your units will die quickly.  The range fire in particular is very deadly to units out in the open.  
There is a lot more movement and planning needed to get your units safely into position to battle and destroy the enemy.  That may reflect the nature of the time period well, but as a game I just like the way Ancients plays better.

FUN ★★★★✰
Very nice game, full of movement and with a good pace. It's visually great with these high blocks standing a bit like miniatures. The fact that movement comes from the cards makes that the situation can change quite easiy so that it keeps quite a high level of tension all along the play.

RULES ★★★✰✰
The rules are okay even though I thought it would be a bit more straight forward, looking at the BGG weight score. There are many special cases that need to be well understood. The aid cards are not bad but you can find better ones on BGG.

IMMERSION ★★★★✰
Probably the strongest point of this game. It could go even higher with painted miniatures. Something I could do if I go on playing this game. It would be a 5-start with painted minis and decor, which I'll probably do.

DEPTH ★★★★★
What is good also is that for one game, you can play a lot of different battles with various layouts. But, if you want to play with several different nations, you need to spend quite a fairly high amount of money (4 army expansions and 2 more to play with generals on a bigger map at more than 2 players).

Good game - best of the "Battle Cry" games.

Game has a really coherent design.  Obvious that  Borg and company mapped out the game's development from the get go.  Each coalition antagonist provides a unique puzzle for the grande armee to unlock.

Slightly upped rating after getting 3 additional expansions.  (If you are in any intrigued by CCN, you should get at least 1 expansion, of which the Prussian Army expansion is probably the best.)

Dec., 2017:  After 9 months, design still holds charm for its balance of chrome and elegance.  Really miniatures for those who don't have the patience to paint lead figurines.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Jury still out on this one.

I'm a HUGE fan of the C&C system and own all the games. Ancients is to me, the current pinnacle of the system.

Napoleonics introduces some new elements. Not all of which works for the better. The heart of the game works the same. The new elements include: 

Infantry ability to form a square when attacked by cavalry. Give them a chance to hit back with one die first. Really crippling thing to do given that you 'lose' the ability of one card and need to order the infantry unit out of the square on a subsequent turn. Too much for too little pay-off.

The range fire is more brutal. Artillery goes a longer way. Lots more ranged options even with regular line troops. You can use arty to add support fire for melee attacks.

Another interesting element I kinda like that units get one melee dice per block. Reduced unit strength = lesser dice rolled. However, in reality, this means that weakened units may be forced to retreat in order not to make it an easy VP option. Also, it changes how and when players attack.

Negatives:

So far, the first scenarios might be 'historical' but they don't mean that it makes for a balanced game. Seems a little one sided.

Range fire for artillery is different from infantry. Why? It seems counter-intuitive for arty range fire to diminish in power with distance BUT for infantry range fire to maintain it's power across the entire distance. Shouldn't range fire rules be consistent?

The reference cards are duds compared to Ancients. GMT needs to add a simple column to tell players whether units can move AND fire. And also how many spaces. The info is buried in the rulebook.

Also, might be nice to include a page in the rulebook or on the reference sheet detailing SPECIFIC Napoleonic rules. This means that experienced C&C players can get straight into the game instead of wading through the rulebook for the changes.

I like this game. I feel the tension when trying to manage the resources (cards/units combination). Trying to build up a good hand to push an offensive while countering your opponent gives me a warm feeling of pleasure. The game is simple enough so the flow is not disrupted by references to the manual yet its strategy is adequately complex so that it will keep you engaged throughout.

On the downside, it's sometimes tedious to setup but this lies probably with my inability to organise the pieces correctly :) Also, the occasional game will be decided with pure luck (dice mostly, less the hand of cards), but it's rare enough, as in real life I guess.

Using the Battlelore system, this game provides a stern strategic test for 2 players in a series of Napoleonic battles.

This is a cool take of the C&C system! It is certainly the most complicated version I've tried (I think? Don't really remember much about BattleLore), but it all works well. It includes everything I remember from the other historical versions -- battle back, leaders, multiple troop subtypes -- but also modifies the combat strength of units according to the number of figures present ("finally!", some might say), alters the board configuration (wider center, narrower flanks), and adds in some Napoleonic flavor (combined arms, square formations). If I could play it enough to internalize all the differences between the troop types, the game would flow much better. Still, very enjoyable!

It has enough additional rules to make it different than Ancients and personally I think it provides more decision points as well. The game is beautiful but I think the dice are a little cartoonish but that isn't a show stopper. I don't have a problem reading the font like others, but the player aid cards could have been condensed.
  Some people will be disappointed by its simplicity, but I like the fact that most scenarios can be played in a hour. The most important factor for me is it is fun and easily taught to others.

RATING: 7
So, I've played what seems like a lot of the Memoir line now.

Positive aspects of C&C:N
- More variety in tactics than in C&C:A where it just seems important to hold formation and flank
- Low toy factor (compared to BoW & Memoir)

Negative aspects of C&C:N
- The publishers remain unable to spell 'colours'
- First scenario seems to be pretty dull for the French
- GMT artwork/colour scheme is still hideous!
- Text-heavy cards
- Even more modifiers!
- Terrain tiles are glossy card rather than the beautiful DoW Memoir tiles

Most of the negatives are minor quibbles and, provided the other scenarios are interesting then this could well be one of the most interesting entries in the family.

Update: In 5 plays I've not really found a deeply exciting scenario. Too much seems to depend on holding formations still, with cavalry being almost entirely made redundant by defensive squares. Like, C&C(u):A, this might just not play quickly enough (too many passed turns) to keep my interest.

Rating down from 7.5 to 7.

Simply Awesome.  Very fun, very tactical, and feels like Napoleonics.  

9.25 2/28/12: still the best I've seen in 2 hours or less consistently.  Very accessible and works well with miniatures.

8.5 6/14/12:  Really like it, but needs a few minor tweeks.  The charts are nice cardstock but horribly organized.  Eventually GMT should reprint a deluxe edition with better charts, rulebook, nicer grapically produced gameboard, and deeper game box. Hopefully, current owners would be able to buy these separately instead of the whole core game.

I have played all the games in the Borg system, except he Samurai stuff, and will say that the system was meant for Napoleonics. This is a maturation of the system to perfection. Even the luck element of cards in hand makes sense in terms of command and control in the period. Each element of an army, cav, inf, art have their own personality. Winning comes more often to the player that coordinates their units, but even the perfect plan may get defeated by crappy rolls...such is fate. 25 plays under the belt and I have only scratched the surface and continue to learn strategy. If you choose one Borg system game, this is it. 

Having recently added the 5th expansion with tactician cards, this game is now my favorite all time game. A 10 has gotten better. At this point have played nearly 100 games between real life and online.

RATING: 9
A much slower, longer and surprising different game than C&C:A. Much greater emphasis on manoeuvring, ranged combat, and terrain. The scenarios are more asymmetrical than those in C&C:A with a clear sense of who's attacking and who's defending. I enjoy the cut and thrust and free-for-all nature of C&C:A more. Initial rating of 7.

10 plays: Still working through the base game scenarios. The pace and feel of the game is starting to grow on me. Rating increased to 8.

20 plays: Working my way through the first expansion with the Spanish Army. I'm starting to enjoy the different feel from C&C:A, especially the changes involving block loss, ranged combat, and national distinctions but something's still gnawing away at me concerning the lack of incentive to attack. Stays at 8.

30 plays: Just about finished playing all scenarios in the first expansion and can't wait to start on the Russians. Rating increased to 9.

40 plays: Am now playing through the Russian expansion and have got as far as Eylau. Murat's cavalry charge didn't turn out to be the close run thing that it was in real life. Rating stays at 9.

Simple and fun. If you want genuinely serious Napoleonic play then this is not the game. This is more thematic and does a good job at producing entertaining light war play. But I've taken a lot of play from these sets as its always easy to get a game on with it, so it scores hign for its fun factor more than anything.

A little finicky with the number of similar but separate units, and it definitely needs better player aids, but I love the way these different types of units interact, the separation of melee vs. ranged, formations, terrain, and so on.  It felt like units appropriately strong or weak, depending on how they were being used.  This felt much more like a real battle than a Memoir 44 scenario.

This could be a solid 8 with some play, my two games being solo to learn the ruleset. With the C&C series it just gets too fiddly in the end, there's something clumsy about the core idea I just haven't bought into.

1st play.. and I'm disappointed. Why does it feel so dice and card draw dependent?? Hopefully it's the Rolica scenario's fault - very unfriendly towards French units. I only got my brain tired because of translating the English rules into Polish, not because I was contemplating my troops moves.

Great Game. Quick, enjoyable and challenging.
The card system for commands make's it ideal for a solo adaption, and with a few 'house rules' easy to enhance for historical accuracy (if that's your thing) 
Now buying the expansions!!

The major change in this version of C&C is that the number of battle dice you roll is linked to unit strength (number of blocks). While this is definitely more thematic than in C&C:Ancients, it makes the luck of the dice play a much bigger role than i'd prefer. Essentially the only way to attack is to put yourself in range of an enemy unit; if you roll poorly, not only do you have to deal with a near-certain retaliation from your opponent, but any casualties your unit suffers (should your opponent roll well) will have a knock-on effect in any future battles.

Easily the best historical entry into Borg's commands line. It is much more approachable than Ancients while being more strategically engaging than Memoir. I wish the board were more attractive but you can't win them all.

RATING: 9
Like this a lot, probably more than M44.  After playing two scenarios, I'm a little concerned that the advantage goes to the defender.  I appreciate that most likely a slower, more cautious advance would even things up, but at the risk of the game going on longer than its weight deserves.

I'll always take a strategic wargame over a tactical one EXCEPT for command and colors napoleonics.  If you are a tactical gamer you owe it to yourself to buy this game.  Even if you aren't you should still check this out.

Finally the Napoleonics version of the C&C system we've been waiting for.  Good unit selection and use of the tactics such as square along with the long awaited reduction in capabilities as the unit takes hits.  This one will replace my Vive L'Emperor for my Nappy fix.

If you want tactical Napoleonics that you can play in an hour or so, this is the place to go!  I was even a little surprised at the amount of chrome you could get into a Command and Colors game and still have it be easy, fast-playing, and fun.

The Commands & Colors system has its flaws, but that being said, I really enjoy the game, it's one of my favorites and it's great fun. I'm currently engaged in a project to convert all my old 15mm painted minis for the 1809 campaign to be used for C&C!

Two player card driven, left-right-center war game of 15 scenarios during the Napoleonic period. Formations, bolster units and unit combo actions. Important timing when to play cards. Special dice driven combat. A ton of units and stickering. The board and components are not flashy but look and play very well.

A basic Napoleonic game. Easy to play and under three hours for most games. The card system keeps the game moving quickly. The components are high quality and the reference cards are useful. 

If I were a tester for the game I would make certain rule improvements. The game could be improved by giving the leaders more importance such as a command radius or +1 to an attack. There is no rule for for formations: line or column. I think there also should be a way to deploy light infantry as skirmishers. 

Cavalry also seems a little under employed. They were the shock troops of their time, but they are not as useful in this game except for forcing units into square. However, their strength is comparable to that of infantry which does not seem right. They should have a greater advantage to force infantry to route when charging.

If the units did not have troops on both sides of the blocks so your opponent could not see them, it would improve the fog of war for the game. Once the blocks are visible by line of sight, I would make the rule that they would be laid down flat. I would have troops on one side and national flags or corps flags on the other.

If you read this, I like C&C Napoleonic's a lot. It is easy for a newbie to play. It also mimics the problem of coordinating forces and their limitations for a successful attack in 19th century combat. Although it lacks a little for me, it still keeps my attention. I think Fantasy Flight's Eagle and the Lion is a better game because it addresses many of the issues I list with the exception of the fog of war.

I strongly suspect that I may never need another quick-playing Napoleonic wargame. Sure, Waterloo is amazing played out in 28mm miniature with great scenery, but few of us have the space to dedicate to storing the mountain of models required. You have to pick a period and stick to it like glue. Mostly.

I chose the Colonial wars, and so my loft is already filled with Zulu warriors. Not actual Zulus, as that would be ridiculous - all that shield hammering, spear-chucking, foot stamping and whatnot would keep my young daughter awake. Bloody Zulus! So you and I, dear reader, are left to play out the great Napoleonic battles using stickered blocks and Richard Borg's superb game system.

Now, the stickering is a hassle, but ho-hum it's gotta be done - took me approx 3 hours. Also, the dice-whiners should strap on a pair - I'm a dice freak, and I think these are pretty good (I don't like the dice-face-image used for cavalary - why not use a profile of a bleedin' horse, and not what appears to be the front of a camel-rider? It'd be much easier to identify from across the battlefield).

The rules are also well written. After first reading, I was left with zero questions that necessitated me logging on here for a check of the FAQ. That is rare, believe me.

This is possibly my favourite version of "The System" almost exclusively due to the theme, and how the game wheels and gears drive the Napoleonic battles into a fun game experience, easily playable twice in an evening. Mr Borg's game manages to bombard the players with tense bloodthirsty melees and, usually, an interesting narrative is formed from the plays. Pretty rousing stuff for a heavily abstracted game-engine. I feel that Richard has, with a French sabre, trimmed away all the unnecessary fat that clogs the machinery in lesser games.

Do not underestimate the use of combined arms or horsey breakthroughs. Forming squares is murderous against cavalry, obviously, and is as it should be - with a typical 20% loss of command ability when activated and maintained.

Sure the game's simple enough, but there are a lot of wrinkles that will necessitate you spying the national reference sheets, and terrain modifier charts, frequently. That makes this overall product more complex than BattleLore, say.

Believe me, playing as Napoleon or any French general, you will learn to fear the British musket, especially if they're camped on a ruddy hillock with leader support. Likewise, the British should be mindful of French cavalry, and engaging the croissant-eating rank and file in close combat - those damned Frenchies know how to handle a briquet! Both sides should be equally wary of approaching any cannonade position - artillery will ruthlessly fling your men and tons of Belgian soil into the air!

My win/loss score: 6 games to 2 (both losses were me playing as the British).

Absolutely outstanding game. Very chesslike in feel. The fact that you play cards out of your hand and activate units like chit-pull activations in other games gives it very good solitairability. In addition the multiple unit types and abilities give it a lot of flavor. Destined to become a classic...

I have played most of the games using this system.  The component quality and the rule book are very good.  Better than Ancients because of some of the extra chrome and terrain is much more important.  However, it is not nearly as much fun as BattleLore or Westeros.  Cavalry seem a little weak.  A few rules seem a little weird.

Dice pool AND cards in a tactical combat. The entire battle could as easily be decided with one die roll. The game is THAT random. Unless you want to wait forever for the opponent to attack or build an awesome card hand one at a time. Boring.

More strategy and tactics then in the other C&C, especially over Memoir. Good simulation of Cavalry (regrouping, advancing and pursuit), infantry (with square formation) and artillery (with horses) and combined arms. Best C&C game ! 

Minor points : 
No objectives in scenario's, rather unknown battles in the Peninsula, lot of little rules (square formation)

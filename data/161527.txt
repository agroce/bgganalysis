A very nice version of Catan, which more or less contains the base game + the Great River + the Catan Helpers. The "Great Pyramid" scenario is the main attraction here, and it plays nicely. The artwork is really something to behold: this has got to be the nicest version of Catan out there. I'm not sold on the plastic bits, though, because they make the map a bit hard to read at first glance (the cities have different sculpts from each other, which is cool, but it makes them harder to spot). Also, the "bricks" for the pyramid are cheap cardboard tokens: these would have benefited from being in 3d (wood or plastic). But I'm nitpicking. This is probably the best version of Catan out there.

This is an excellent version of Catan. The Nile map, papyrus boats, god cards, and player pieces really set the theme. My favourite mechanic though is the ability to add the most recent block to the pyramid to gain the Pharaoh's favour for a +1 victory point condition while at the same time putting the other players at -1 victory point condition. It shapes a more interesting and dramatic end game.

Really nice set - visually attractive and nicely themed. If you're a Catan fan and have affection for ancient Egypt, check it out. The gods as helpers are a nice touch. The advanced game works really well.

There's a great deal to love about Catan.  This special edition offers an Egyptian theme.  Wonderful art and design, easy to teach.  Included dice are cheap and have no weight, should be replaced.

The various God's powers add a strong 'take-that' element that imbalances play. What's the point in set collection if an opponent can force you to give cards up?  Great theme, but unfortunately a step down from the original. (August 2015)

I never felt sold on Catan, but I picked this one up anyway. I think any version that has ability cards highly improves the game. Love the theme.

The Gods make Settlers more fun to play, but it still feels a bit broken. The Scenario where players are building the pyramid is better.

When I did the review of the basic Catan I said that, for me, it feels like an on-work product, as if something were missing. I thing that this game provides that extra missing parts. The most important one: the Gods. Now there are alternatives in case of bad starting locations, which is very important. In addition to that, now you hace the pyramid and the river mechanics that provides something to pay attention to.
As I day do not play basic catan, that Game needs more things!

RATING: 6
Looks great but I thought it was the worst version of Catan I've tried. Some god cards seem awesome, others useless. Plus, the gold pyramid pieces end the game quickly. Our game felt like it was over before it really started.

It's probably a better game with repeated plays. Honestly, my first game was so boring than I'm not going to seek out trying it again.

Catan with an Ancient Egypt theme. As a history major, this definitely belongs in my collection. Soon...

RATING: 8
Very nice variation of Catan which can be played both as a regular Settlers of Catan and with God cards and/or great pyramid construction site.
God-cards and great pyramid construction site give a new tactical dimension to the game, which is very interesting for more experienced gamers looking for mayor decision-taking.
On the other hand the mechanism moving the game forward, which is basic resource production, still depends on dice rolling, which means it is completely luck-dependant. That luck-factor is partially controlled in the classical catan-style, telling you with font size and color what numbers are more probable to be rolled than others, but statistics work in a... statistical way.
So finally luck may decide who’s winning the game, but here you have a lot of different paths to choose and decisions to make, which makes it a lot of fun to play.
And on top of all it's a really beautiful edition, which always helps bringing it to the table.

After a video preview: It's a limited edition catan game where you can play the original game or play the build the pyramid scenario. Could be worth it for those who do not have catan yet or simply collectors.

Lovely artwork IMO and reason enough for me to purchase.
I don't mind the plastic pieces or euro-mini resource cards.  

Annoying things: the hex tiles are not made with same thick cardboard as the border tiles (why?  WHY?), the supplied pyramid looks pathetic and will be replaced with a custom version.

So is a solid specialty Catan and I think the Great Pyramid scenario is great (you can play this as regular Catan, but why would you?)....the God powers are very powerful, but the mechanics keep them moving so as not to overwhelm and there are actually several ways to end the game so you aren't forced to get the full VPs.  My only beef is the components...Mayfair really fell down here...the Great Pyramid...there was no reason this couldn't have been little plastic bricks (after all we already had plastic everything else for each player!) instead of CARDBOARD.  So then the "Great" pyramid just looks....sad...(JW)

The basic Catan with some minor upgrades. The best part of it is the ambientation and the materials inside the box (oxes instead of roads? Hell yeah). The box is art. A little bit overprized.

After one play with the pyramid scenario, I thought it went too long even with just 3 players, but the god cards and building the pyramid, having to maybe build boats, adds a lot more to manage to your turn, which is enjoyable.  The god cards, in particular, are a good idea.  I'm a sucker for pyramids, so this game called out to me even though it's out of production, and I don't regret buying it.  As others have remarked, the hex and frame quality is lacking a bit, the component mixture of plastic and cardboard is an oddity, and even the disparity in size between development cards and resource cards is a puzzler.  The artwork is nice, however, offsetting some of the component oddities.  Worthwhile if you still have an itch for Catan.

Catan is a family favourite that I can play with a lot of people. Not my favourite as the dice mechanism is extremely random and annoying.

This version adds God cards which fix the dice problem, but all the casual gamers I play with hated it because it adds an extra mechanism for them to deal with and they can't be bothered with it. The pyramid variant was a fun novelty that got a couple of plays but won't play again most likely.

I hate literally every Catan  expansion, they add nothing to the game. I use this to play vanilla 4 player as the components are vastly superior to vanilla Catan. Good upgrade on the base game for those times I can't convince casual players to play a better game.

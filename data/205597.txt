Not simply a streamlined version of RftG, but not NOT that either.  Really boils its source material down to an extremely tight race to build an engine.  At the same time it seems to set itself apart from its source-- different enough to keep both.

The City rethemed. I prefer The City more. This game ends as suprise and starting hand (as well as second hand) matters too much. As there is only few rounds, getting engine running is essential. Some cards allow good engine building, others don't.

Good card game (fast, light Version of Race for the Galaxy, lighter than San Juan). 
Nearly no player interaction. It plays very solitaire, only a few cards that let you score points depending on other players.

This was what they should have released before Race for the Galaxy.  It's an *excellent* introduction to the system.  Quick, fun, and full of meaningful choices.  Doesn't overstay its welcome (thus far it's always 6 or 7 rounds long).  It usually comes down to the question of who can implement the most broken combo first/fastest/most effectively.  I LOVE IT!!!

I've seen a lot of critics drawing fallacious comparisons between Jump Drive and Race for the Galaxy. The games are only superficially similar, in that RFTG *can* be an engine builder, while Jump Drive *is* one. RFTG can be fair, while Jump Drive is fair. Mean jokes aside, Jump Drive plays much more closely to a TCG crossed with Splendor than RFTG. It shares the same visual queues, nomenclature, and basic premise of gathering VPs generated by your cards, but everything else is different and will be reviewed as a different game.

Fittingly, this is a game that exists because the in-lore races built an engine for interstellar travel while the game itself is an engine-builder. You will play one of two cards types from your hand each turn (for a discount), or one of each type (for no discount), trying to build a draw engine and a VP gathering engine. First to 50 VP is the winner.

The game really is as simple as I make it seem here. It fully plays with that design space: by discounting Development type cards with other cards, discounting Settle type cards with other cards, or adding to your Military to make the special subset of Settlement planets possible. This means you can rack up some pretty cheap power combos fast and your opponent will have to aim ever-higher as the game moves on.

Jump Drive allows you to usually hold back several cards in hand, even when you're dropping heavily costed cards in the late game, which means you can keep your opponent guessing as to what final insane turn of VP you're going to scoop up. Our first game was rather timid: we built engines slowly, balancing all aspects of the game (VPs, cards, discounts, military, so on...) and both of us finished with 52 points. In our latest game, the second-to-last turn had me at 45 points, just 5 away from victory, then I won 94-62. We both at least doubled our scores just by ramping to "close" to 50 points, then going way over in one huge sweep. Achieving that high score feeling is great and appeals to my inner-arcade gamer. My only lament is that the rules do not have a tiered ranking chart with titles, much like the game Roll Player, so you can really feel that sense of objective accomplishment (not relative to your opponent's score). I have no idea if 94 is a good score because of this and no idea how much I need to improve.

It didn't feel like chance played a significant role in the game, at least not yet. This is a major plus for the game and makes it feel "comfy" rather than cutthroat or like a salt-mine. Since you're just engine optimizing and not really drafting, there's definitely a distinct lack of player interaction but I don't mind that much since "player interaction" in small card games like this tends to involve shitting on your opponent's face as hard as possible. Something as simple as Star Realms drafting would go a long way, but I can see why they would want to avoid something so incredibly random in this game.

I can easily see Jump Drive making my top games of all time as long as subsequent plays tend to be this perfect. The only real balance problem I can see with the game is Galactic Trendsetters, and I don't think it'll ever come up. You score 2VP per each of them each turn end which is an exponential growth function. If you draw few of them early, it's not worth playing. If you happen to draw more later, it's so insane it can cause the game to swing wildly. Short of starting the game with 2 in hand (Start Hand D), I can see this invoking the great Demon of Salt if a losing player happens to get a lucky Trendsetters or two in the late game after they blindly built into 2 of them throughout the game.

The amount of playtesting hours put into this game is obvious, though. After having experienced all of the (nonrandom) opening hands, I can say that it was smart to put non-card based ways of setting up your military or getting fodder cards for paying costs. Having those two extra guaranteed outlets really gives you peace of mind when starting with a tight hand.

The game does have one downfall though and it's the randomized starting hand variant (which is the intended way of playing it past the first couple of times). The starting hands are so cleverly engineered that it seems idiotic to subject ourselves to an unpolished, potentially unbalanced randomfest of a starting hand configuration. I know it's one of the factors that consistently ruined TCGs and Race for the Galaxy for us, so Jump Drive is lucky that it included those preconfigured hands. Without them, this game would've been ranked much lower, as there aren't any good rules for handling the random starting hands and they detract significantly from the experience (one player ALWAYS gets a better start).

Overall, buy this game. It's perfect at 2P at the very least and insanely cheap. It's easy as hell to teach, has streamlined iconography, and (while ugly as fuck) has good component quality. This game plays fast, is satisfying, and you want to just keep playing all day.

So this game is much simpler than you can expect, which can make bad shuffles/ deals make it feel like you didn't have choices to make to change the outcome. But on good shuffles, with players familiar with the deck, it is a very tight competitive little game .

First there was Race for the Galaxy and then there was The City, which made a game of building German conurbations out of Race's settle action and it was bad.  Now comes Jump Drive, which is essentially The City returned to a galaxy far away.  Again, engines are built rapidly - or you lose - and there are those huge card draws that always bring something useful.  The game can play on autopilot if a starting hand sets your direction and draws re-inforce it.  Despite those similarities, on early acquaintance I find Jump Drive more palatable than The City.  Perhaps I'm going soft.

Artwork and production quality are both decent.

I like this a lot but despite knowing it's a short filler, its comparative depth makes the luck of the draw just a tad too significant in my eyes. However it is early days, so familiarity with more of the card combos might mitigate that issue. I would definitely have preferred to have been able to mess with the other players' plans though - the slightest opportunity would be preferable to none at all.

Engine building in turbo mode. There's really not much interaction here at all, just a few random cards that depend slightly on what other players are doing -- Yet the game is extremely fun, and hits a sweet spot for complexity vs. time required. I like this best with two players; More players don't add anything positive, just waiting around and a need to shuffle the deck.

A lightweight version of [i][thing=28143][/thing][/i].  On the surface, that sounds great.  However, [i]Jump Drive[/i] is really meant to be an introductory game to the whole [i]Race[/i] universe. If you've already fallen in love with [i][thing=28143]Race[/thing][/i] or it's younger (and better) brother, [i][thing=132531]Roll[/thing][/i], then you'll find [i]Jump Drive[/i] to be unsatisfying fare.

To say that is is in the same universe means there are a lot of the same names here: Artist Colony, Contact Specialist, Galactic Imperium, you name it.  They all appear here, although in slightly different forms.  If you're new to this setting, then great!  You'll learn them for the first time.  But if you're coming from having played the older games many, many times then you're relearning how to evaluate what sound like old friends.

Ultimately, [i]Jump Drive[/i] really becomes a game about card churn.  It's possible and even probable that you will end up drawing 10+ cards per turn, when you're only allowed to keep 10 of them.  Within those 10 cards, you hope to find synergies with the tableau you've laid out so far.

As each round has the same series of actions (and I will admit that "Explore" and "Survey Team" break the mold, here), the game ends up being considered in [i]rounds[/i].  It will be over in seven to eight [i]rounds[/i].  This isn't too far off from a game of [i]Race[/i], but for some reason the rounds aren't as pronounced.  I think it's because in the latter title, you think more in terms of [i]role selections[/i], which depending upon your ability to read your opponents' strategies, can end up being more or less.  That tension is not present in [i]Jump Drive[/i].

I wanted to like this game because I'm a huge fan of [i][thing=132531]Roll[/thing][/i] and rapidly becoming a bigger fan of [i][thing=28143]Race[/thing][/i] due to its iOS app.  However, I find [i]Jump Drive[/i] to be a little too streamlined and homogenized to recommend it to veteran gamers.  To novice ones, perhaps.

RATING: 4
As addictive as a candy box, Jump Drive fills a key role that is often overlooked by more ambitious games, that of a light card game that plays as fast as a filler: actually, being a filler is Jump Drive’s real nature as it feels like a reworked and slighly more challenging version of The City rather than a dumbed down edition of Race for the Galaxy, with some extra meat added to disguise the fact that, in its core, it’s still an overgrown filler.

As a proof, it’s short, just like a proper filler: it never lasts more than seven turns and often ends after six, insomuch that it could be rightfully dubbed «Sprint to the Galaxy», to keep the bond with the parent game it takes its theme and basic mechanism from.
Being so short, you also feel somehow compelled to play it several times in a row just like you would a filler but wouldn’t a longer, heavier, brainier game.

Lastly, I see how it tries to correct a few issues The City had, which helps make me think it has more in common with the latter than its science fiction themed progenitor: first of all, the do-nothing action of drawing five cards and keeping one is no longer a wasted turn, as now it grants twice as many cards and also makes for a higher number of drawn cards to choose from. Same goes with the Survey Team (formerly the Architect), which allows to play a second (world) card rather than taking an entire turn. 
There are also more interactions between cards and, apart from the very specialized chromosomes that rarely seem to pay off, every other icon may now grant a fair share of bonus points (and yet only Seti and the Galactic Federation feel slightly overpowered), opposite to The City, where the only reliable path to point grinding was building fountains over and over.

All in all, Jump Drive is a great game for the light game it is. And an addictive one at that! [i](July 2017)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - Several dozen games later I’m no longer as enthusiast about Jump Drive as I used to be at first: in the end it’s just Toyland for the overthinkers and AP-prone gamers whose favorite activity turns a quick filler into a painful slog for everyone else.

There’s nothing «light» about Jump Drive, that is far from being the filler it looks like: it’s just an exercise in optimization that requires just grinding victory points and finding the best/most rewarding combos out of the cards they’re dealt.

Hence, in February 2018 I lowered my rating from an overly enthusiastic 8 to a more realistic 4.

A nice little filler with simple set collection/tableau building elements. Like many of these games; Progress begins slow but grows exponentially each round until someone hits the points threshold. Most points wins - not necessarily the one hitting the threshold first.

Race for the Galaxy in 10 minutes with most of the complexity gone (no produce/consume, explore is simplified, and no role selection) and the interaction completely different (solely cards that score points based on cards in another player's tableau).  

I may be in the minority, but I really like it.  It doesn't replace Race for me, but if I'm looking for something quick and simple, I suspect I'll pick up JD.

An excellent filler game. I can play Race for the Galaxy in a very short time, but only if I am playing against a single opponent who is familiar with the game; this game plays reasonably quickly even with completely new players. It is also easy to teach, although it has just enough exceptions that you do need to teach it rather than let people pick it up. Low interaction, although I have lost games thanks to banking on that and watching my opponent hit on some exceptions.

My other go-to filler game is Lost Legacy. This is lower interaction, and takes a bit longer. But there is a much deeper game here.

Solid engine builder that feels like drafting.  Quick enough that if your strategy does not work out, you can quickly play another round.

Favorite 2 player variant is to deal 6 cards to each player.  Draft 2 cards, pass to opponent.  They draft 2 and discard the rest.  Each player then draws one card from the deck.

I was pretty skeptical of this considering I already know and love Race for the Galaxy. I didn't really feel the need to play a lighter version, however after playing it, I made sure to buy a copy.

This game feels like Race, but it plays so much faster and it feels simple and streamlined. I also understand the logic that some people have used when they state that this can be kind of a bridge to Race, because this will allow you to adapt to the iconography.

Multiplayer. Filler card game.


Pros:
Good introduction to the Race for the Galaxy universe.
Fast enough.
Surprisingly interesting game.



Cons:
Sprint for the Galaxy: the gaining of cards and VP goes so fast that it's not even satisfying anymore, even tho I'm not winning I still feel like it's "too easy" to get VPs and cards. If RftG is sort of an Engine-builder... this one is like a pre-built engines collection game. 


Note: 
Comparing this game to Race is the bigest mistake, since this game serves its purpose. Good intro game to RftG's verse. Plays faster. Good filler game. 

I still prefer RftG, but like to play this one as well.

RATING: 6
Rating on this will likely change as I play it more. Seems like a nice, light take on Race for the Galaxy, distilled down to just making a quick little engine that gets you to 50 points the quickest. No more action selection or producing/delivering goods; just playing worlds and developments to create a quick point scoring machine, as most games last about 7 rounds, and each round consists of simply playing a card or two and scoring points.

I can see this being a nice go-to filler that plays in 15 minutes but still feels a little meaty.

RATING: 3
This effectively introduces the _Race for the Galaxy_ world without too much complexity, but it does so by removing almost all of the strategy, tactics, or decision making. I exhausted several friends worth of willingness to play trying to figure out the game; in the end, the game feels quick and light, but entirely too random.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
Snappy distillation of Race for the Galaxy. It has a similar feel while achieving its goals in a much shorter timeframe. The only problem with this is that it feels as though luck is a large factor and what you draw definitely matters. There are less tools to get around this and less time in the arc to overcome this challenge.

That's not overly annoying, however, and is acceptable given the brief time commitment. Within that short amount of length, the game really hits you with an utterly satisfying engine builder experience that's very compelling. At times, the game showers you with cards and victory points and the huge deluge of resources validates your tactical plays with a great feedback loop.

If you don't mind your engine builder being swingy, this lightning quick offering is a fantastic little game.

A streamlined Race for the Galaxy for sure with the difference of first to 50 points wins. They aren't kidding when they say this game is over in 6-7 rounds on average. Our first game was 8 rounds and in the last round I had 24 points and still lost. It distills RftG into playing development and world (regular and military) cards, using the card powers, and gaining victory points and more cards at the end of each turn. It's pretty multi-player solitaire but it does have some cards that allow you to gain points and cards from your opponent if played so there is interaction in that regard. The only downside for me is the use of chits for keeping score. This game screams scoreboard to me as otherwise you're counting round points and income each turn plus total points as well towards the end. It gets better with more plays and the game can really be played in 15 minutes.

RATING: 7
Really enjoyable filler, with similar decisions to Race but different mechanisms.  It's not just simplified Race, it does have its own choices w.r.t. the tempo and the scoring.  Plus, having multiples of the same cards (e.g. Galactic Trendsetters) is a neat choice and opens up some interesting strategies.

Still, though, it's a short card game that plays kind of like Race, so why not just play Race?  We play mainly 2PA, and our games are maybe 20-30 minutes, filled with interesting and difficult decisions.  Jump Drive cuts down on the time, but also on the decisions as it is a bit more luck dependent.

Still a good game (and a preferable Race spin-off to Roll), but I don't think it's going to stick around.  We would never choose to play it over Race, except for *maybe* as a quick filler with 4 p (and then it is competing with Eggs and Empires, or For Sale, amongst others).

EDIT: This game just won't let me get rid of it!  I keep thinking about it, and keep going back to it for a quick, filler card game that is really quite easy to learn.  2p, 3p, 4p, I'd definitely still reach for this.  Sure, it won't displace RFTG, but it would displace something like Arboretum for a filler card game.  So welcome back, Jump Drive!

Fast-paced Race for the Galaxy-lite, with theme and combo building just like the original, with 1/4 the complexity. I'm not sure it has staying power like Race does, but it is a nice and quick card game when you are waiting for the rest of the group to arrive.

Disclaimer: I tried Race for the Galaxy once; hated it. I'm okay with Roll for the Galaxy and enjoyed 1/2 plays of that. This game... didn't like it. The only positive thing about it? It is a lot shorter than Race. There's very little involved. And I wonder how much luck of the draw factors in with how quickly it can end.

This game is pretty fun, but the limited options may eventually lead to this one leaving our collection. It will be interesting to see if they release any expansions. This game may also be a little too quick for us. We like engine building games that are a bit longer and let you run your engine for a bit.

Race for the Galaxy lite. Enjoyable and not as likely to give you a headache as Race is. The card draw is a huge factor at the end of the game. You can be poised for a big play, only to draw a fistful of one- and two-point cards.

Fast, simple and simple enough to pick up. Lacks a little something for me, just as you start getting into a rhythm and reasonable plan of attack, the game has ended. Interested to try it's larger counterparts to see if they have what I'm looking for.
Good for second step gamers (just after gateway)

My friends like Jump Drive more than Race for the Galaxy for some reason. I don't like how friction-less engine building is. Race is generally a difficult game, because you have to balance seeing more cards with actually playing cards to the table. In Jump Drive, you can always draw cards and play cards, so you end up just playing the best card in your hand each turn, not needing to weigh suboptimal choices in an effort to not fall too far behind like Race can make you do.

Happy to own this since The City was hard for me to acquire.   This feels a little slower since the deck has a huge number of different cards in it (like a RFTG deck) and requires a bit more thought.   But, like The City, it is all about the rich getting richer exponentially fast.  If your first three turns aren't stellar, you have lost.  Period.  There is no way to come back.   On the other hand, it is short and simple and pretty fun to go through the motions of playing.   Will inevitably get compared to RFTG but probably shouldn't be.

Enjoyable, quick tableau-building game. The rulebook could be more descriptive and explicit in some areas - I puzzled over certain parts of the rulebook longer than I should have for such a short game. I've never played The City, Roll, or Race, and I probably never will. My 10-year-old can play and be competitive; for my 8-year-old, there was a bit too much going on to remember and he became frustrated.

The rules take twice as long as the game.

A tableau building game where you play cards and pay for then by discarding your other cards. Cards have symbols and text that give you combo bonuses that help you score points and draw more cards. First to 50 points (or most) wins.

In my first and only game I greatly misjudged the pace of the game and was expecting a few more rounds. By the time I looked up the game was over and I scored 11 points. I think if you play this multiple times and know the deck and some possibilities it would increase the enjoyment of the game. But for this type of game I'd much rather play a deckbuilder like dominion, or a more similar game, Fleet.

RATING: 4
Jump Drive is a stripped down version of Race for the Galaxy, removing the interesting features of the Consume and Produce phases. It has not provided me with the interesting decisions and card interactions that Race has. It's a basic engine builder, and I have better options in that genre. You can end up drawing lots of cards and then having to discard back to ten repeatedly, which is a drag. I have some issues with the iconography, which are a hurdle for me and have been for others.

I was hoping for a Race-type game that I could play with my family, but I'll stick with playing Race with gamers.

Jump Drive is basically Race for the Galaxy for newbies. It draws a lot of influence from Tom Lehmann's The City. It removes the confusing iconography of Race, the goods and their consumption, and the phase selection. Despite calling it Race for newbies, there are a lot of Race veterans that really enjoy this one as a quick 10 - 20 minute filler. I can completely understand the appeal of this game to Race fans and people who enjoy light card games. As someone who has played a ton of Race for the Galaxy and a bit of Roll for the Galaxy, I don't feel as though I want a quicker/lighter iteration of that system. If I'm going to play a quick filler, there are other games that I would prefer to play. Even if they take an extra 10 - 20 minutes.

This game is good for what it is, but it does leave something to be desired.  Since the games go so quick, it doesn't leave a lot of room for strategy.  This is even more so with 4 players since it seems it will always end with 1 player getting their intended combo working by getting the right cards, mostly by luck of the draw.  It's still a good filler game and thankfully, we can always play race or roll for the galaxy for a more satisfying experience.

Ügyesen egyszerűsítették az alapjátékot. Kiszedték a bonyolult fázisokat, így sokkal könnyebben tanítható, de közben túl sokat nem csorbult a játékélmény. Persze rftg profiknak nem érdemes erre váltani, de akit eddig csak az alapjáték bonyolultsága, nehézkes ikonozása riasztott el, annak érdemes tenni egy próbát. Egyetlen hátránya talán, hogy a szerepválasztás kiszedésével már tényleg nem nagyon maradt benne interakció. Ezt érezhették az alkotók is, és néhány kifejezetten interaktív kártya bekerült a játékba, de még így is elég erős az egymás mellett játszás érzése.

A seriously condensed relative of Race for the Galaxy, but again slightly beefed up from The City. The readded complexity probably hurts newbie play a little but it does feel more strategically open than The City which doesn't require hard decisions all that often and lends itself better to autopilot play, so overall this feels like an improvement (over The City; it doesn't hold a candle to Race).

Race for the Galaxy light. The game gets rid of all the phases and boils everything down to developing and/or settling.

The game is over in 6-7 rounds, extremely fast filler for those that know how to play. I find the game is really good being a quick filler or as a way to get someone into Race for the Galaxy because they can learn the cards (which are mostly similar to the ones in Race). There is less symbolism overall but it is still there and several cards have special powers/conditions

The engine building isn't as complex but it is still satisfying to build up and try different setups.

It's a simplified Race for the Galaxy with some similar mechanics. It lacks the ability to utilize other player's actions to your advantage and it's even less interactive between players.

I just like RftG so, so much better than this. I love the idea of having a simpler version of RftG to introduce people to the concepts and then "upgrading" them to RftG, but that's just it, this will never be more than a stepping-stone. It's different enough and it's fun and quick. But the exponential character of the economy makes it so that usually the player with the best start wins. The game is too quick, there's never really a chance to catch up if you have a bad start. It just doesn't feel as polished as its big brother.

RATING: 9
Excellent distillation of Race for the Galaxy.  It works as nice training wheels for Race, too.  I dig it.

Addendum:  This game is a lot of fun.  I absolutely love it.  Some complaints I have heard from folks I have played with is that it is over too quickly, that they haven’t been able to get their engines out and working.  That isn’t what this game sets out to do, however.  It’s a down and dirty point grab.  You have to be agile in your strategy and not be too nostalgic about a particular plan or unwilling to part with certain powerful, yet expensive, cards because of that plan.  So I’m raising it a point.

RFTG, minus the produce/ship loop (which I never liked anyway) and the midgame (which maybe I do miss).

At least, that's my impression. It seems like the idea of "points income" should change the lay of the land, and I realize this started life as a non-RFTG series game. But at the very least, the strategic landscape I see around me as a bad Jump Drive player looks like the one I see as a bad RFTG player.

It serves to introduce a few basic concepts of "Race for the Galaxy" to new players, as advertised, but it is a good game on its own.

020 minutes race for the galaxy
- choose to explore or play 1 or 2 cards (face down, simultaneously).
- reveal & execute:
  . explore: draw 2+(number of eye icons) then discard (number of eye icons)
  . development = technology: pay cost (-1 if it is the only card) to put a technology in play
  . planet (military conquest = cost zero but must have military strength, or colonize = pay cost, then get 1 card if this was the only card you played)
- get VP's from all cards in play. Check if someone wins = stops the game.
- get income (=cards) from all cards in play.
Rince & repeat!

RATING: 6
They took Race for the Galaxy, then removed the exploration phase, then removed the consume phase, then removed the production phase, then removed the role selection.  Every turn you build a planet and/or a tech card.  At the end of your turn, every card in your tableau makes you draw cards and/or VP.  Huge snowballing effect as you'll get about half your total VP in the last round.  Might work as a gateway to Race/Roll for the galaxy or as a filler.  Much more tactical than strategic.

This one really does deserve the "Multiplayer Solitaire" label.

VERY simple watered down version of Race for the Galaxy. It's basically the tableau building portion minus the action selection.

It's actually quite good as an intro game to race/roll but there is not very much player interaction which is somewhat disappointing. I think there's maybe only 1 or 2 cards in the whole set that actually have anything to do with other players. It sometimes feels like you're playing solitaire with someone else.

Even with the lack of interaction it plays quite quickly and is still enjoyable for when you want to play a quick tableau builder.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (November 2017)

I love Race for the Galaxy, a game currently on my Top Ten games of all time so I always buy everything they release for it. As the game was introduced to me as Race for the Galaxy: Jump Drive I, naturally, assumed it was an expansion for the game. When I played it this month I was surprised to find out it is a base game based on RFTG, but independent from it.

The rules are very short and, for once for a RFTG game, they are very well written and easy to understand from the rulebook. You can teach the game under 5 minutes, it is very simple. Playtime is around 20 minutes and it could be a lot less with experienced players.

The art is cool, but it is recycled from other RFTG games. The theme is pasted on.

After reading the rules, I thought the game was going to be boring for me, but we kind of liked it. The core of the game remains the same (hand management, you have to pay with cards), but now there are no roles to play or follow, any player can play the card they want to and if you play only one card you get a benefit (as if you played a role in the old RFTG), if you play two cards you don’t get any benefit. After all players have played their cards, they draw more cards and earn VPs based on the cards they already played. The decisions needed to play the game aren’t complex, but you do have to think them through.

There is luck of the draw with the cards, but as I have only played the game once, I’m not sure if it is uncontrollable or not.

The end game comes very abruptly, in my next game I will be prepared for it.

Bottom line, Jump Drive is an ok game. I obviously prefer Race for the Galaxy, but teaching that game is a pain, teaching Jump Drive is much more easy. Has this been any other game, I would have already sold it, but as it is part of the Race for the Galaxy universe, I think I will keep it for a little longer, but it is too simple to appeal to me. I will give it more opportunities to woe me, though.

Érdekes, hogy nem került a dobozra semmi Race for the Galaxy felirat. Pedig gondolom marketing szempontból biztosan jövedelmező lett volna. Így viszont némileg egyértelműbb, hogy ez nem tartozik a RftG-hoz.
Arra kíváncsi lennék, hogy amennyiben teljesen új dizájnt kapott volna, akkor lenne-e értelme egyáltalán arról beszélni, hogy mennyire hasonlít az RftG-hoz, mert az az érzésem, hogy abban az esetben fel sem merülne ez a kérdés. Ez egy teljesen más játék, így aki a RftG-t keresi benne, felejtse el, mert ez nem egy egyszerűbb változata.

Nekem mindenesetre eléggé tetszik az első néhány kétfős parti után, remek tempója, hangulata van, gyorsan eszkalálódik a helyzet, és amíg az első 1-3 fordulóban alig termelünk GYP-t, utána már egy-egy fordulóban többtíz pont is becsurog, egy kis rutinnal tényleg 10-15 perces játék ez.

The first couple rounds are often slow and one wonders why it says in the rules that games usually only last 6-7 rounds...and then you or someone else plays a 9 cost card that works well with their tableau and score 20-30 points in one round and the game is over just like that! I'd likely advise showing players at least a couple of the 9 cost development cards, etc so they know what could happen in a learning game...I still prefer the original RftG over this one, but this does play more quickly and is more accessible with less icons, etc.

Shorter and simpler Race for the Galaxy, or more complex The City? Whatever, it's a fun filler. Its super-shortness and snowballing make it fascinating, but also increases the luck factor. Still, in such a short game that's not much of an issue.

The name "Jump Drive" is no joke.  This game is lightning fast.  One of my favorite parts of the game is all of the synergies you'll find between cards.  Makes you feel like you're really pulling off some crazy move since there is a big snowball effect.  There's also a ton of hand management.  You have to balance which cards are crucial to your engine with which ones can be used to pay for building the crucial cards.  

For a 10-15 minute game that costs $15, it's hard to top.  Must enjoy engine building games, though.

FUN: even more of a race than Race for the Galaxy and it plays much faster as well. Improves on The City by making the bookkeeping much easier.

It sells itself as an introduction to the world of Race for the Galaxy, and that's what it is. Compared to its older brothers, it is a lot simpler (it doesn't require extensive learning of iconography, for example), and plays a lot faster. It still manages to give you a taste of the RftG family, especially with the cards-as-currency, tableau and engine building mechanisms. It's a very enjoyable game.

I think that it generally does a good job of streamlining the key elements of Race for the Galaxy into a zippy fun game.  Some games, however, you will be very limited by how you draw, but luckily games really do only last 15-20 minutes.  The game is best judged after a series of plays rather than just one.

Unfortunately, even with the streamlined rules, my partner got confused with the fiddly differences in playing the cards.  It's very straightforward for a gamer, but perhaps too finicky for a casual player.

RATING: 7
People who complain that Race for the Galaxy is "multiplayer solitaire" are wrong.  THIS is multiplayer solitaire.  For a short game, it requires too much bookkeeping, and is too long for what it is, given that it's marginally shorter than Race, and lacks most of the strategy.
I suppose it serves a purpose as "training wheels" for Race, but that's about it.

So far this falls in the "like it but not sure yet if I love it" bucket.  My first few plays threw me off since I wasn't expecting it to be quite as fast as it was.  Once I came to expect that, I've really been enjoying it.  The balance of cards to points is nice, there's some cool engine/combo-building here,  and I like getting a similar experience to RftG in a fraction of the time and with far fewer fiddly rules.  As a filler with some meat on it, this is a great choice.

A very awesome and quick playing prequel to Race for the Galaxy. It can end even more quickly than RftG, but that's the point. The designer, Tom Lehmann, has said that it's meant to be played while you're waiting for people to show up for game night or at the end of the night. I think it serves that purpose very well. I plan on playing it during my lunch break. Well done, Mr. Lehmann!

Better than Race for the Galaxy because easier to teach, carry, and faster to play.  Lacks the depth of Race.  Wins because you can actually teach this easily and people will actually understand what they are doing.
My preference is Roll for the Galaxy.  Has more depth and still easy to teach and have people understand what they are doing.  However, Jump Drive wins in the portability department.  Either way, many options now to enjoy this genre of space development game.

A fun puzzly game. It may seem harder to teach than it actually is to play. Alot of different combinations available and games can sometimes come down to a point or two. Three things keep it from shining: 1) military seems a bit strong 2) in the end-game you often draw an unnecessarily high amount of cards, that you then have to sort through and 3) the box insert is TOTALLY worthless.

Wow - a worthy introduction to Race For The Galaxy that not only captures the feel and characteristics of its bigger brother but also feels like its own game.  Easy to learn and quick to play, yet feeling like a game twice as long and three times the weight, this was an instant winner for us and sits comfortably on the shelf next to Race and its expansions.  I can easily see us getting well over a hundred plays out of this.

Lots of hype about this game, and it's fun and all, but... not quite as fun as the hype implied.  Players I've played it with liked it well enough, but nothing special or groundbreaking here.

Certainly a lot lighter and easier to get into than Race for the Galaxy, but I'd prefer to play Race I think, even with the added complexity.

Also some rules are not well explained, and there are gaps in the explanations of some cards which confuses players.

Jump Drive is from the Race for the Galaxy universe, but is its own thing as far as mechanisms, so it does not feel like a direct lite version of Race.  But, the way the game introduces iconography and some of the general ideas found in Race, however the game does not stand well on its own.  Very luck driven where you know you can't win as early as turn 3.  Worth a play, but not more than 5 before the shine is gone.  Sold at DTC 2017.

I wonder who thought "what we need is Race, but shorter"?

It's Race but with all the actual interesting bits stripped out. There's no phases, no leeching, no goods, and no trading. While the surface of the game is similar, it's very hard to defend against the charge that it is multiplayer solitaire.

I suppose it's inoffensive and quick, but I'd like my games to have a bit more going for them than that.

RATING: 8
Very promising combination of The City and RftG, even though both the rulesheet and the card texts could have used quite a bit more refinement. Now they lead to more questions than answers.

Some observations from the first 6 plays:
- Architekt is very tempting now, because it does not use up the entire turn, and also gives explore and military icons.
- Very interesting new implementations of Baukolonne: one is effectively RftG's Colony Ship, and the military version is quite clever as well.
- Stadtvillas are easier to get to the table now, since they do not have any prerequisites. This may be slightly balanced by the lack of the original Baukolonne.
- Military is strong as well if you just manage to get it rolling with a high income.
- Explore icons are massive VP generators but seem trickier to pull off than military.
- Some nice brown planet combos in there as well, giving good RftG vibes. 
- Alien Toy Shop is a decent starting card ;P
- Yet to see what to do with genes but there must be some decent combos in there as well.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]At first I was excited to get this game, thinking maybe it would be a gateway into Race for some folks. Upon it's release I realized that Jump Drive shared some key concepts with Race, but played it in a very different fashion and I tempered my excitement. I finally got a chance to play a couple of 2p games and enjoyed it immensely.

Right off the bat the structure of the game is very different since cards in your tableau score points every round which leads to a game that plays even quicker than Race. Typically my son and I can play a game of Race in under 20 minutes, Jump Drive is about 10 minutes tops. In Jump Drive games typically play out in 6 to 8 rounds. 

There are enough similarities to Race that Jump Drive could definitely be a jumping off point to try and get people excited about taking the time to learn Race. At the same time it is an excellent filler that offers a surprising amount of strategic depth. I'll also mention that it is simple to teach the game if you have some familiarity Race, but folks unfamiliar may still struggle through their first game or two. The couple of plays I got in were enough to convince me that Jump Drive deserves a spot on our shelves becuse there are enough differences from Race.[/i]

"Amazing quick and interesting engine-building game. I don't love Race for the Galaxy, but I am quickly falling in love with Jump Drive."

What I like:
- Small box, inexpensive
- Super-fast setup, and plays really quickly
- Smooth and pretty easy to teach, but has really interesting decisions
- No attacks (and the minor leaching isn't bad)
- Space theme is fun, and is present enough that it doesn't feel totally abstract
- Serious and semi-serious gamers have loved this game

What I don't like:
- The "explore" action is a bit wonky
- With the game only lasting 6-8 rounds, randomness might be high (not sure yet)
- There are a couple rules that are slightly tricky to teach to casual gamers
- I *really* wish it could officially handle 5p (or even 6)...fingers crossed for an expansion to do that
- I wish the box were even a bit smaller, but hopefully it is sized for expansions

I was always disappointed that The City wasn't available in English, but Jump Drive is even better for me (partly due to theme). JD captures the fun parts of Race for the Galaxy, while dropping the parts I didn't enjoy. For me, this replaces RftG and San Juan, but also Saint Petersburg. 

Rating raised from 8 to 9 after 16 plays. It is going to get a lot of plays at gamedays, as everyone who has played it has loved it. 

I have enjoyed playing it solitaire, with just one hand, and no opponent. I try to hit the winning condition in as few rounds as possible, and with as many points as  possible. A couple cards don't work that well without opponents, but I just don't bother playing those and spend them instead. 

The game actually works fine with 5p, as long as you use substitutes for VP chips, and don't mind shuffling pretty often. 

I would put the weight around 2.0, which is quite a bit higher than BGG voters. I suspect a lot of RftG fans are trying JD and think it's lighter than it really is.

It feels like simplified Race but it also feels like a streamlined Saint Petersburg.   Of course there is not as much depth here and it is not as good of a game as Race, but it is a fun game to play.  The expensive developments are really fun to put into play as their rewards are immediately felt. I do, however, think it is a bit TOO easy to get a draw engine going.  It seems fairly common to be drawing 15+ cards the last round or two.  This can mean that since everyone will be drawing enough cards to pay for the expensive planets and devs, whoever draws the best will win.  It's short and so not a fatal flaw but it keeps me from rating higher than a 7.

For the games in the RftG universe, I would rank them:

Plays quickly and is great as a 2-player. 

*Update 8/14/2017* Played it about 15x now and it still hasn't gotten old. The sooner you commit to a strategy, the better it is for your success in the game. Don't be shy about the Explore option. It's better than many give it credit for; the ability to boost your hand with a bunch of new cards can really carry you through to the end of the game. 

Still rating it a 9. Want to see a 5th player option. There's already 5 Trade Pacts in the game, so why not add a Survey Team and maybe adapt some Developments and Worlds from Rftg over to Jump Drive?

Jump Drive a simplified card game based on Race for the Galaxy. The game does away with the role selection, and lets all players play one development and one settlement during their turn. Each card provides some combination of card income and point income that activates every turn. The game ends when someone hits 50 points. I found that this was really too oversimplified for me. While you could develop synergies as the game progressed, everything really hinges on what cards you draw, and the game isn't long enough to adjust or tune your strategy mid-game. Basically, it was fun getting combos, but I didn't feel like I had much control.

(2 plays)

RATING: 8
It's basically Race for the Galaxy stripped to the bare minimum. On a turn, you're going to either place a world, develop or both. You can also explore if you need to, but you would rather do one of the other two options if you can. If you just develop, you get a -1 discount. If you only settle, you get to draw a card. You can do both, but you don't get either bonus. Cards have points they generate each turn and the first to break 50 ends the game. Highest points win.

I enjoy this one a fair amount as Race kind of fell into a weird category. It's too heavy for a lot of gamers and it's too short for a main event. This falls squarely into the filler category at 10 minutes or so a game. It's no Race, but it's not trying to be either.

Decent implementation of a shorter streamlined Race for the Galaxy.  The trading for cards and VPs were simplified, exploring was similar, and develop and settling were near identical to Race.  It played quicker and didn't feel it ended too soon.

The iconology is better than Race's, however still needed improvement.  The Survey action wasn't used at all.  Without starting worlds like Race, can be caught without early card generation.  The end condition of 50 VPs should be better, causing people to be counting points constantly.

It is a light version of Race for the Galaxy. Make sure you watch the play through because the rules are as clear as mud. Once you have the rules down it is a quick and fun game. But those first couple of games are make or break if you move on. Overall it is good but nit great.

Love how cards in your hand is used as a resource to pay for the cards you want to play. The amount of points you gain each round really escalates quickly which makes the game incredibly short. And that's not a bad thing in my opinion. That only means you can play multiple games in a row.

Stand alone card game in the Race setting. I don't like Race but I do enjoy Roll and this is even easier and faster than that one. This is a game about drafting cards and trying to combo to get the most points possible. Once someone hits 50 points the game is over and everyone tally's up. Fast and fun little game. I can see this one hitting the table for a while to come. Easy to play and teach is always a positive thing.

Joe taught me this as a lunchtime game, describing it as 'Race for the Galaxy in pill form'. That's a perfect summary. It's (even) less interactive than Race but still has the cardboard-crack addictiveness of the combo-building. I don't imagine it having a particularly long shelf-life but it packs enough punch for a 10-minute diversion.

EDIT: 30 plays in, I guess I misjudged the shelf-life!

This does just what is seeks out to do--be a super fast Race for the Galaxy. If you're familiar with that game, this will be very easy to learn (and even if you aren't it's easy to learn). The game takes only a few rounds and it's over. In that time you get to play a handful of cards to craft a few combos. There's little player interaction going on here--what people do has almost no bearing on what you're doing. Whomever can rack up 50 points in the fewest turns wins. 

I find this to be about the same as I do Race or Roll for the Galaxy. I can see why they're beloved by many, but they're not quite my thing. I enjoy them from time to time, but they're far too tactical with little ability for long term strategy which is what I prefer. Plus the entire game involves constantly evaluating cards which is another thing I don't always like. I'll play this from time to time because it is so fast and still involves meaningful decisions but for me it's a pretty average game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
There's something oddly addictive about this game, with its roughly 6 turns to get your engine going. You pick a strategy based on your opening hand and then you work out risk/reward to see it through. Each hand you make some light choices about what to keep in your hand to try and build over the next turn or two. It is very casual planning ahead and managing opportunity costs. The game features reasonable, clear problems that are also presented to the players reasonably and clearly, and then you work with (or around)those problems reasonably and clearly. This sounds ludicrous, but many games can't/don't get this right, preferring to gussy up simple scoring tables with tedious minigames. 

It is almost entirely solitaire, as you're playing alongside your opponent rather than against them. But it's a very pleasant amount of problem-solving, making the best of what you're dealt, and doing some light card game synergizing (i.e., spotting reasonable risks, counting cards to a degree, spotting the ways that cards might work well together, etc). For 10-15 minutes, it hits a lot of things I like about card games. 

The theme does nothing for me (as in, it's neutral at best) -- I really just pay attention to the icons and not the thematic reason for their existence. Most of the time at game's end I cannot tell you the names of my cards. So overall I guess I'm saying I enjoy this as an abstract card game. For me, engine building has to be quick -- I don't ordinarily enjoy spending two hours building an engine one agonizing building at a time so that I can take 5 resources and turn them into 6 resources and march up the conversion chart another inch. There's a lot to like about Jump Drive, though.

They have removed all the choices out of RFTG.  Fortunately, it plays in 10 minutes and has a very small shelf-print.  This will likely be the filler of choice for a while, then maybe we can bring back race.

2-4 players, best with 2 or 3.  15-30 min.
I love this game because it's quick to set up, easy to learn, plays quickly, involves lots of tactical decisions, and involves no direct conflict with other playes.  Each turn presents several play options, and your success depends primarily how well you play thye cards that you have.  I like the fact that othe other players actions do not screw up your own plans.  Very addictive.  There are opportunities to really score big if you play the right combos. Even if you lose, the real fun is in the journey and it is always fun to see how the other players performs with their strategy.  
And last but not least, it plays very well with just 2 players.

I'm a huge fan of Roll for the Galaxy.  While they don't really play the same, this game is familiar.  The streamlined gameplay makes Jump Drive very approachable.

You still have the same sort of resource/hand management choices you find in Race for the Galaxy, but the action selection and Produce/Trade/Consume bit has been removed.

I think this game will commonly be pitched as a streamlined version of Race for the Galaxy. That is true, and that is not a good thing. This game is Race for the Galaxy after a dementor has sucked out the game's soul. The game lacks nearly everything that makes Race for the Galaxy interesting and fun.

RATING: 6.5
Jump Drive is a pretty good game.  Not fantastic by any means, but it's short play time and satisfying ramp-up make up for the overall blandness of the mechanics.  This was a game I bought based on Rahdo-hype, which I should know better to ignore (his taste and mine don't often overlap).  But I think I'll keep it in my collection for now, since it's nice to have quick/small games like this in the collection.

15 minutes version of Race for the Galaxy. I can only see myself playing this when I really want to play RftG like game but only have less than 20 minutes. Otherwise I prefer playing RftG. 
The game ends very suddenly once players build a 9 cost development. There is quite a bit of luck on which 9 cost development (if any) you get in your hand.

Luck of the draw + low player interaction + short game = runaway leaders. Sure, that doesn't matter as much since you can just play another round, but I felt like my decisions barely affected the outcome of the game.

Jump Drive seems to have the same basic dynamic as Race but luck of the draw seems to be a bigger potential issue than it is in Race, and the decision paths seem less interesting. Race doesn't take much longer to play and is a significantly deeper game than JD. The one aspect JD has over Race is the ability to score points off of another player's tableau, and this is very interesting. JD is admittedly much easier to teach/approach than Race and as a filler it holds its own.

RATING: 7
Holds up on its own, regardless of its relationship to Race for the Galaxy. Kind of wish there were more interactive elements beyond "Player X is in the lead so I need to make a slightly riskier play to pull ahead", but not a huge deal. It's a fairly relaxing game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
There's virtually no player interaction, so why would I even want to play this with other people? I never once cared about what any other player was doing. The game supposedly plays quickly, but when I need to read through every card in an increasingly large hand, it can drag a bit.

Nice quick, fun and simple game to learn. They biffed the rules a bit in clarifying some of the more complicated cards. But no game can be perfect. Play time with 2 was literally 10-15 mins. Such a nice game to toss between longer ones. There are some fun synergies between cards.

A faster, easier version of Race for the Galaxy. I wish we would have had this first before Race. I still remember those first few games of Race for the Galaxy. The games took us 3 times longer than they should have, and we were constantly looking up rules and icons--and still got so much wrong!

For me, I don't believe tye perfect game exists, but flawless games do. A flawless game is one that, in my opinion, has no bad or weak elements. Perhaps they could be better, but they're not bad in any way. Jump Drive is such a game. Flawless, and as such deserves a 10/10 from me.

This is a great variant of Race. The only downsides are the luck of the card draw and the manner in which points are accumulated during the game using Race chips. Using chips requires recounting or consolidation which slows the game somewhat. A score board might be better, but it would make it less portable and perhaps more expensive. It has the essentials of Race in a faster play time and fewer icons to worry about.

Jump Drive is a solid tense engine builder - splendor meets race for the galaxy - really enjoy every time the 10mins it takes to play - maybe a bit too much luck - but that might be lack of experience

RATING: 7
This is basically the filler version of [thing=28143][/thing].  Games take about 15 minutes and you get a similar feel as Race but without the role selection.  It's 99% multiplayer solitaire, which is something that has typically bothered me about Race, but feels OK to me in such a short game.  Nothing groundbreaking here, but it's a "meatier" filler that I think will find a place at my regular gaming night.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Initial impression: This game is excellent! You build up an engine of victory points and card draw using the familiar Race for the Galaxy interface. The game has a nice arc to it where early on you only have one or two options to establish your engine because of your limited number of cards, but after just a few turns you're overwhelmed with options and you're drawing tons of cards. All of this in about 20 minutes or less.

You have a hand of cards and you can build them by discarding other cards from your hand. Each card essentially gives you victory points every round, lets you draw more cards every round, or both. Some cards also have extra abilities.

Even if you don't have any good cards to build, there are two options that give you some freedom. One option them lets you draw a bunch of cards, mix them with your hand, and then discard a bunch of cards. You get a net gain of two cards and you get to dig for cards that synergize well. Another option is to build a certain card that is set aside at the start of the game. This card gives you a little bit of military power (which is needed to build certain types of cards) and a little bit of card draw, so you can get setup in the early game.

As a fan of engine-building multiplayer-solitaire games, this game is just great.

Update: I've seen a couple of complaints about this game so far: that it comes down to pure luck of the draw, and there is no player interaction at all. I just want to say that both things are completely true. If those are big issues for you, then stay away.

Perhaps in a longer game those would be issues. For me, that's missing the point. The point is that in 10-15 minutes you get the feeling of building up to something, comboing cards, pushing your luck, all culminating in a final turn where you might score 30 points (in a game where 50 total points triggers the end game condition). Maybe you still didn't win because somebody else drew the perfect 9-cost card on the last turn or none of your cards had any synergy through the whole game. It doesn't matter, you just do it all again.

It's almost over [i]too[/i] quickly. I know that's the point here. But I feel like the winner is the one who gets the best draw in the first two turns. Then it's over before anything else can change that.

::UPDATE:: 
2/23/2017 - Even though what I wrote above is still true, I still like it. There's something about it that makes me think about playing it more and more. Fun maybe?

I've actually come to appreciate it for solitaire play too. Keeper.

I do not like Race for the Galaxy pretty much due to its amount of icons and the shortness of it - I feel it's over before the fun begins. Jump Drive is even shorter but does not suffer from the plethora of icons of RftG. But here the shortness of it does not matter because it feels right for the game. The engine building card comboing is still very much there. The downside to it is that all player interaction is removed apart from a few cards that feed off what other players have built. Jump Drive is so short it doesn't really matter much though. You can just play it again afterwards.

I had to really make peace with the inherent dichotomy of this game: It's a very fast and chaotic construct that demands you understand the entire deck. For a while I couldn't appreciate it for what it was, as I was too busy being furious that the game expected so much from me yet returned so little.

However, after I relaxed and got more plays under my belt, I started to appreciate it for what it is, and my last few plays have been very enjoyable.

An absolutely brilliant, speedy, escalating knife-fight of a game - about a third of Race For The Galaxy, this will see you truly RACING in three rounds if not two, plus the interactive synergies are surprising and welcome.

I wish this was a simpler RFTG instead of...whatever this is. It's enjoyable, don't get me wrong, but it's undeniably a random luckfest once you have a base understanding of the deck. The score spiking is legitimately funny though.

Essentially no player interaction (some cards give you benefit based on what others have already built). Many different strategies are available based on the cards you're dealt, and easily possible to get an engine going after a few rounds. Very fast to play, good filler, though I wish it had more player interaction.  Game will likely get old very fast as there really isn't much variety in the cards and you go through all the cards every game.

Fast little filler that uses the race for the galaxy universe. Was pitched as a lighter version, but in reality there isn't really much similarity beyond the art.

All the same it's a great little filler. Can be hammered out with the wife in 10 minutes, works great when we want something quick.

I am very familiar with both Race for the Galaxy and The City, so was intrigued by this mash-up. This game is more than just The City with art taken from RftG - the setting allows for more intricate cards and combinations. 
But this causes the game to drag on a bit longer than The City, becoming more multiplayer solitaire.

I still favor Roll's take on this series, but this is a really nice contribution if you want to do Something for the Galaxy, but have to teach it to new players and/or have very little time.

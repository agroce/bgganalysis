Witness is utterly unique. Each player tries to solve cases with his or her other investigators by whispering clues, piecing together these clues to form a picture of what happened, and then answering three questions at the end of each case. This is a challenging game for those who like to think. 

If you have three friends who are up for a challenge, then get this game. This game can be frustrating for those who cannot remember information or are bad at piecing puzzles together. 

After playing it a bit more I have increased my rating to a 9.5. I could play this almost every night if I could. It is just so different. I hope an expansion comes out.

1st play: Fun, social, fast. A great filler length game that can be played with anyone. There's ear whispering so may not be suitable for public meet ups but with the right group, pretty comical.

2nd play: When you have exactly 4 people, this is a great party game.  Really, as a couples game it's ideal.  There are great moments where the clues you get just don't add up, and you have to pass them on, knowing they're messed up.  Good times and plays very quickly.

RATING: 7
A wonderful cooperative deduction game where players play a game of telephone in order to answer the questions to a particular case. Problem is, each player has a different part of the puzzle and no one knows what the questions are until the end of the information-exchange. Thus, there is potential for players to mischaracterize and misconstrue the importance of the evidence. 

That being said, this is one of those "consumable games." Once you have played a puzzle, there is little-to-no replayability factor, unless you have a very bad memory. But with 64 cases, you certainly get your money's worth. 

Hopefully additional cases will be published in the future.

RATING: 7.8
A really clever game of "telephone" wrapped up in a huge collection of charming little mysteries.  Highly recommended if you have the right player count and don't mind memory elements in your games.  A great opener/closer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A very unique and original game. The cases are great, 64 total cases, both murder and mystery cases. 
Players are trying to solve a mystery or a crime and each player knows one clue, then through a series of clue passing between players and after a final phase of questions about the case are asked, players try to solve the case writing their conclusions on a piece of paper and comparing those answers to the case solution.
The only "problem" is that it requires exactly 4 players, won't work with fewer or more players, and it may be considered a consumable game since in some cases you will remember the solution and render that case unusable, at least until you can remember the solution, I doubt you'll remember anything after more than a year.
Great fun.

Fun to use deduction, but some are too easy and others are just too hard. The whispering doesn't feel like co-op and if someone has bad memory you aren't going to score points. Telephone is usually about the comedy of how horrible people mess up the message, here you're trying to win as a team so it's funny but then you'll lose. More of an activity than a game. It might be a gimmick, so score might go down.

:d10-4:
In short, the 'telephone' gimmick makes for a poor game experience that rarely feels cooperative.

Each of the four players gets 1/4 of the clues, then passes that clue (and later, clues heard from others) to a neighbor by whisper. After three rounds of clue-passing, the players are tasked with individually answering a series of questions about the case. Scoring is cooperatively based on each of the individual players' correct and incorrect answers.

Either the information is passed accurately, and you each silently solve the same puzzle, or someone messes up and there's a feel bad moment when the answers are revealed. In both cases, the game never feels particularly cooperative.

I was looking for SHCD-lite, but this ain't it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A really clever game where players read the background of a case together, and then read a page of their own personal book to see what evidence the know about the case.

In an order that the game dictates, players then share information with each other, gradually learning more and more about the case.  You may not take notes during this time, so it ends up being quite a bit of a memory exercise.

Once several rounds of sharing have been completed, players are then allowed to jot down notes, and three questions about the case are posed.  Some times, the questions are straight up regurgitation of information you've learned, and others you might have to apply some logic or puzzle solving to answer the questions.  Each player answers the questions themselves, scoring 1 point for each correct question.  Add up all of the scores to see how the entire team scored.

Overall, really well done.  I normally hate both memory and deduction, but there really wasn't much in the way of deduction in the cases we did (some may have more than others, but you can't really browse the cases without spoiling them, so I don't really know).  The memory ranged from tedious (remembering peoples' names) to more fun for me (remembering how to draw a picture or something with more details).  I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed it!

So much freaking love for this fascinating game.  You are all investigators who have some information that you have gathered and need to pass to your fellow investigators by whispering your information to someone else, hearing other people's information and passing all that information to someone else... it's easier in practice.  You then write everything you can remember down and then the questions come out.  The game is only playable by exactly 4 people, and is a co-op.  You can score up to 12 points as a team.  Funny, fun, and really works your little grey cells.  This game was an instabuy shortly after playing my first session of it.

Usually I'm pretty good at memory games... I was shocked at just how bad I am at this one! We're still on the first-level cases and I average about one question right per case. I guess when you're so focused on just remembering it's pretty hard to actually think and deduce at the same time. You get time to write down your thoughts and think things through after the fact, but while you're listening you're also trying to remember what you heard before and think of ways to combine everything to pass onto the next player. It's pretty neat, frankly. It's a fun little mental exercise.

This also, for what it's worth, might now be my most unique 10 minute game.

Woah this game is unique - and, fortunately, also very good! 
My family usually loves deduction games (Sleuth being their favorite among some and Hanabi highly rated as well), but many deduction games fall flat. This game takes the deduction genre in a whole new direction by introducing it as a cooperatively game for exactly 4 players in which you must whisper clues in each other's ears! Once the game is over, you are all asked the same three questions and each player has to come up with the correct answers by deducing and putting together the various pieces of information he/she has gotten during the game!

Each scenario usually takes 10-15 minutes, and the game comes with 64 cases, so the replayability is quite good. Sure, when you have solved a case, you can't really play it again, but I would argue that you can do so if you play it with a different group once a year has passed - that way only a fourth of the group will vaguely know what's going on. I'm definitely planning to do so.

The game produces some pretty tense moments, and once you're done whispering everybody frantically grabs a pencil and write down what they can remember. After our first 9 games, we have only got a perfect score of 12 once... The game has cases of varying difficulty, with some games being extremely tough (we have not had a 0 point game yet, but we have had a 1 point game, and I'm sure we will get a scoreless game sooner or later).

I guess some downsides are the fact that you must be EXACTLY 4 players, and I've had situations where 3 players wanted to play and 5 and 6. Also, as every player needs to answer the exact same questions, some people might feel a little dumb if they couldn't figure something out the other players could. Still, this is a game I'm looking very much forward playing again with my family (and, later, friends).

RATING: 8
Great filler for exactly four involving logic and memory. Really short rules and game but one that a group will probably play two or three times in quick succession in order to chase that elusive score of '12'. It is the sort of game that requires the right group to make it fun. The artwork (by Jacobs, who also worked with Herge on Tintin) and the layout of all the books are top notch. Cases played so far have been varied and interesting: 
Beginner 1-12, 
Normal 13-20, 22-27
Difficult 35, 37, 40, 44, 51, 54
Diabolical 57-59

[u]Deduction[/u]/party game for (exactly) 4 players. It combines a memory activity with a co-operative logic puzzle activity. Each of the 64 cases is completely different. It's a unique game because it has the feeling of discovering a detective story too. There are few cases which can not be played with a simple translation (word riddles). It's important to concentrate on the bold parts of the witness statements if playing this game in another language.

This is more like an activity than an actual game.  Each person acts as a witness to a crime.  It's like telephone as you whisper to the neighbor all that you "saw" or know about the crime.  At the end certain question will be asked and the person who got the most questions correct wins.  I believe though, that we try to win this as a group(?).

A game of telephone played in multiple stages followed by a deduction/puzzle-solving phase using the information derived from said game.

Mon coup de cœur de cette fin d'année !

De 2 à 4 marques jaunes pour des énigmes de 15 minutes (mais on en fait en général 3 ou 4)

Witness is a game of telephone mixed with a logic puzzle. Everyone has some clues and you take turns whispering them into your neighbors ears. What inevitably happens is someone fucks up something along the way and the person whispering to you has fallen apart laughing. It goes something like this,

-dude leans over and starts whispering in your ear, "the duke was next to the conductors office, the countess didn't hear anything and the baron was in room...fuck, shit, the baron was in the bathroom? NO the duke was in the bathroom, 'the duke was taking a deuce' the Baron was next to the conductor. The countess was in room 2. Or an even numbered room. I forget. Fuck."

Then we all get asked 3 questions and have to answer them privately. Then we reveal and score points as a group. Max score is 12, we scored 8. It was really fun and I'd love to play it with Ariel and I and another couple. It only plays 4 people.

A cooperative deduction game set in the Blake & Mortimer universe.  Players play one of the four main characters from the comic series (although I can only recall Labrousse in two of the stories ... SOS Meteors, and the Sarcophagus in the Antarctic one), and work their way through 64 cases.  Each case has one player receiving a quarter of the information necessary to deduce the solution.  Players have to play Chinese Whispers, passing and memorizing information around the table.  After four rounds of this, everyone should know everything, but of course it's much more difficult than that.  Players each then secretly answer three questions about the case and read out the solution - you get a maximum of 12 points then you've won.  

Very difficult to rate - quite unique in feel, and that's no mean feat these days.  A weird mixture of hilarity as you try and keep instantly disposable factoids in your head, then nut through the questions.  

Very clever - I liked it.

I bought this on the recommendation of SH&SD, and I was not disappointed. Sure it's a memory game, but putting the puzzles together at the end is what make it special. And the fact that the listeners cannot prompt the whisperer for any clarification (other than "repeat"), makes for lots of strange/confused/frustrated looks passing between players. Lots of fun.

A game to prove how good or bad everyone’s short-term memory is in your game group. Mine stinks, yet I love this game.

There are basically 2 skills at play:
1. Remember and repeat everything you hear
2. Take what you remember hearing and deduce the right answer  to the whodunit — or lacking all information, use abductive reasoning to be as creative in your guess as possible!

One of the biggest obstacles to remembering is laughing hard when someone whispering clues is getting it completely wrong and you both know it.

+ plenty of interaction
+ laughs to be had

– won’t be fun for people with really bad memories
– won’t be fun for people with poor or zero deduction skills

But that is what makes the game, the laughing at your own and other peoples inabilities to remember. Just good lite fun for 30 minutes that also has a great thematic feel (Rating 7.832, Dec 15).

RATING: 4
After 4 Cases.

I love the idea, and I love deduction, but this game was a flop for us. It does require everyone to have their wits about them, so if you're drinking and trying to have fun, you're likely to do poorly on some of the cases. And while it's fun to do poorly at games like Jenga and watch the tower come crashing down, or at Telestrations and laugh at the ridiculousness, doing poorly in Witness leaves you with an empty feeling, because you could have no idea what the answers are to the three questions (because one person screwed up along the way), and then you just feel helpless and frustrated, and not be able to laugh it off, Jenga-style. If one person screws up in Captain Sonar or Space Alert at least you can laugh at the resulting chaos. Here, it's just head-scratching confusion. There's simply not enough joy or fun to be had. I can see how this could change drastically depending on your group--I don't think I have the time or patience to figure out how to make this one work.

This games has a very special mechanism where you have to whisper clues to other players and solve some mystery case.  This is set in the Blake and Mortimer universe which I really love, but I am not fully sold on the concept and it works only for 4 players which is a massive limitation.  Happy to have tried it but not a game I'm gonna get despite the theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
It's fun to whisper clues, but the 'cases' you're trying to solve are all ripped straight from the pages of puzzle books for kids. A thief visits four houses at 8, 9, 10 and 11pm, and you have to figure out which is which; the green house isn't the house Mr. Jenkins lives in, etc.

About half the cases I've tried involve visual clues, which makes it more interesting since you're still stuck conveying them to your friends with just words. But under all that it's the same dead boring puzzle underneath.

Not recommended unless the memorization aspect is what appeals to you most.

RATING: 6.5
drove me crazy the last couple times...once because of knowledge about the game of dominoes required to solve a mystery (bothers me when deduction games rely on info outside of gamespace...other than use of language etc...)

View of this game is diminishing. I like the central mechanism and theme but not the puzzles themselves...they haven't seemed "fair" or to be an "honest" challenge.

I enjoy the theme, and it all matches really well. It's not the most attractive type of visual for me, so it's not rated higher on that account.

The concept of the game is fun, but it's hard to rate it overall, because the individual scenarios are very hit and miss, and have different skills that are challenged. Some of them felt like way too much was implied and were dissappointed, but others were interesting AF and very rewarding when we put it together. Definitely recommend giving it a try.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (February 2016)

Witness was an unknown to me. I don’t remember why I bought it (perhaps on a sale) but I’m very glad I did. I like the game a lot.

The rules are uber simple, you can explain them under 1 minute. Playtime is around 10 minutes. Witness is a very basic game, but after reading the rules I still didn’t have a hang of it, which is weird these days. You need to play it to really experience it :D.

The art is very good, it is reminiscent of the old Dick Tracy comics (I don’t know the Blake and Mortimer Comics), but the books came wrinkled and battered in my copy, they were too free inside the box and they got damaged during shipping.

Memory is one of my favorite game mechanism, and here it is paramount. You need to listen and pass the information you have and without having a good memory the score will be low. Witness also have lots of deduction which is another (perhaps my favorite) game mechanism, so it works great for me.

The game comes with 64 missions and that’s a lot, still, I feel the replay value is high because most players won’t remember all the facts within 10 minutes, let alone during months!

Witness only works with 4 players, no more and no less. 

I wish I could buy it in Spanish, as you cannot see all other players´ books, you cannot help them with the language as I usually do.

Bottom line, Witness is a novel, unique and original game. Perhaps it is underrated as I haven’t heard much about it. Since I played it, I haven’t stopped thinking about it. I need to play it again soon, a fascinating game but not for everybody. Play it before you buy it.

Like Corto, I assume that a familiarity with the characters would be helpful, but as an American I have no idea who they are.

I have to rate this highly mainly due to its originality. It has been a long time since I've played a game that felt entirely fresh. I don't like the cooperative nature of the game, and that has been a barrier to entry for some players in our group, but I enjoy the memory element and the telephone part of the game is a lot of fun. Like Galaxy Trucker, it's fun to see things go awry.

A different take on Chinese Whispers or Telephone. Players all know a key piece of information from the case and they must relay all the information they know and all the information they get from the other players to one another. After three rounds, players must figure out the case. I had fun with this one and want to play it again. More of a puzzle/activity than a game.

I am really bad a solving the riddles and puzzles and questions.

And in one of the 2 games we played it was so hard to remember anything, because I had no connection at all to the story and the context of the story (don't want to spoil here...). So it was really hard to remember/memorize anything and I failed miserably to solve any of the questions at the end of the game. Same happened to another player in the game who also couldn't solve any question and also had no idea at all :-)

Will try it again soon and we will see.

07-28-2015 - You have to have the right people first of all, not everyone gets into the moderate (to ridiculous depending on difficulty level) deduction this game requires.  It's like spy telephone.

Well this is the telephone game but as good as it gets. 

Because how it works this game exactly needs 4 players.
After you have played all the cases the replayability could be improved by playing as a different character.I am sure there will be custom cases added as well.
Tough though to get them in the book without spoiling too much.

I probably would suggest this as a family game. And I lower the age to 9.

I rated it a 6 because of the exact number and well you sort of need an ideal crowd for this. a couple  and their two children on a cold winter night in a room only lit by a fireplace looks about right.

Witness includes 64 cases for you to solve, and each case starts with an explanatory scene or image or both that someone reads or shows to the group. Each player then looks in his personal casebook to find information available only to his character. Players randomly decide who shares information first and in which direction, e.g., player A might whisper information to player B while player C talks to player D. Next, B will share both his information and A's information to C while D talks to A.

Limited information co-operative games are pretty much the only co-operative games I enjoy, and this is one of them.

The game makes you try and find a balance between clear communication and brevity, where brevity often requires the communicator to make assumptions that can be fatal.

When it all plays out in the end it's often as interesting to work out where things went wrong (if they did) as much as to work out what went right.

While it's very much a game of puzzles its also a game of language and communication, two of the things I enjoy very much in games.

Witness is an interesting bird of a game. On one hand it sticks out like a sore thumb from the rest of it's brethren in that it requires something a little different than your average fair. You can only play with exactly 4 players, no more, no less. It also requires that the players have both a decent memory and a mind that is at least slightly decent at logic puzzles. You listen to a case file, and then all four players have one of the four clues necessary to solve the mystery. Players take turns whispering to predetermined other players what they know up to that point. At four rounds of whispering players must individually answer three questions about the mystery. I have yet to have a team finish above more than 7 points on any mystery, and I have only ever done the easy level mysteries. Its a fun exercise put as a player who does not particularly enjoy logic puzzles all of the time, and someone who's memory can be sketchy at times as well, the game can be quite frustrating. Also, some of the logic puzzles require that you have a predetermined knowledge base before attempting to solve the puzzle. For example one mystery requires that you understand the rules of the game dominoes. I have never played dominoes so I was unable to answer any of the clues for that mystery correctly. This was somewhat frustrating for me, but one nice thing about the game is a mystery is done in about 15 minutes, so you can easily go through 4 different mysteries all in an hour. I will definitely be giving this one more chances, but right now I am not enjoying this one all that much.

This game is not for everyone, but if you enjoy deductive riddles this is a real slam dunk! The whispering mechanism is unique and fun. This game is tough though, and some of the cases seem more difficult than others of the same level. Its fun when you win and hilarious when you lose.

Ein Spiel das nur zu viert funktioniert…
Jeder Spieler erhält eine Teilinformation eines Falles. In 4 Runden muss nun die Information "Stille-Post" mässig im oder gegen den Uhrzeigersinn erzählt werden. Erst nach der 4. Runde dürfen sich die Spieler ihre Infos aufschreiben und danach werden Fragen über den Fall gestellt. Jeder Spieler erhält Punkte für jede der drei Fragen und diese werden dann zusammenaddiert zu einem Gesamtpunktewert.
Ich hatte mir die Memoryeffekt schwerer vorgestellt, obwohl es mir nicht leicht viel, war es dennoch gut machbar, selbst der schwere Fall von Schneewitchen.

Un jeu de déduction très amusant, pour 4 joueurs uniquement (c'est dommage, il ne sortira pas souvent). Le thème est on ne peut plus artificiel, et n'est fait que pour attirer (et tromper) le "non joueur"... Mais c'est pour la bonne cause : c'est plutôt tentant, avec 64 énigmes de difficultés croissantes. Quant à la rejouabilité des énigmes, je suis quand même très sceptique, et c'est vraiment dommage.

A four player only game whose primary mechanism is Telephone.  You get a clue that you must whisper to a neighbor.  Then you must tell those clues to your neighbor.  Then you look at a diagram or get some questions.  This was a lot of fun.  We had a tough time getting a perfect score even with the easy ones.   I liked the game.  It's very puzzle-like but heavily memory dependent.   

If you do not like puzzle or memory games stay away.  Otherwise it is an excellent family game for kids 8+.  Maybe a little tough on very young kids.

Witness is a really fun game made for exactly 4 people. Using the telephone mechanic, players try to transmit their own intel to a neighbour. Over 4 rounds, each player will transmit information twice and receive information twice, they will therefore relay more information as the game plays. At the end of the rounds each player may take notes and then answer 3 questions. This sounds very simple but the cases are all different, fun, and requires a bit of logic, comprehension, and analysis of the situation using the intel gathered.

This game is brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. It combines a game of telephone and memory with an intense co-operative logic puzzle. 

I only have a few complaints, albeit minor ones. First, there are a tiny number of puzzles that aren't great (I'm looking at you "Hamsterdam"). Secondly, the fact that the 64 cases are inherently not replayable means that I eventually won't be able to play this game anymore. But that can be solved if the publishers ever bother to release an expansion pack that I can throw all my money at.

RATING: 8
This game is just so much fun. It's a shame it is 4 player only. Basically it is a game of Chinese whispers with each player getting a quarter of the information. You whisper your quarter in both directions in a preset manner around the players, passing on as well the information others whisper to you. Then you note down what you believe the complete picture of information to be and answer some questions individually, but then score collectively.

The missions (?) can be about anything from identifying spies around a table, murderers, or who has what mustache.

This description doesn't do justice to what is a great game. Some of the best moments in gaming from the last year have been playing this. But I do have one caveat. All four players need to be compos mentis in order for the game to work. If someone is looking drunk and dribbly don't suggest to play this .... or do you? 

In several games I have discerned a friend suddenly developing perfect knowledge in Sub-Saharan Wolof and whispering that language to me. I had absolutely no knowledge of anything they had just whispered as they leant back with a smug look as if they had imparted the knowledge of the world in my left ear. Their eyes did the unsteady sea dog dance of inebriation and winked at me as I realised I was in trouble. I had to whisper something, anything, into the ear of the player to my right. An ear honed by hundreds of thousands of years of evolution to understand every nuance of sounds generated by vibrations in my vocal chords. It was at that point I thought this would be great to watch, knowing the position I was in. I looked again into those inebriated eyes and wondered how inebriated they were or whether they were merely smugly glistening enjoying my predictament. Paranoia had set in. I determined next time i played this game I would psych out the level of inebriation in the other players and sit between to two most monk-like. I leant over and whispered a whole heap of made up mumbo jumbo into that next player's left ear and then sat back with eyes glistening as if I had just imparted the knowledge of the world. What else could I do?!

What a game. Fun, fast and fun, did I mention it was fun. Play it.

Witness is a really quick and clever "deduction" game.  Also, it has you whispering to your friends, which is great fun in a goofy, thrown-back-to-elementary-school way! But the stories are very uneven: some are tricky, others just aren't. And it's not about the supposed difficulty rating: we've played red missions where we all knew all the answers without any confusion at all.  The biggest problem is that it's more of a memory game than a deduction game and for adults a memory test just isn't all that interesting.

Everyone I've played this with has thoroughly enjoyed it, with only one exception.  That person admits to having absolutely zero short term memory and our one game of Witness with him proved his point.

I am amazed at the uniqueness and cleverness of each of the 64 cases.  I am hoping to see expansions with more cases to solve because we are quickly working are way through the cases.

I can't see myself ever owning another game quite like this one.  Solving games by playing a variation of telephone sounds INCREDIBLY TERRIBLE, but it is so much fun.  There are times I have laughed so much trying to convey the facts I knew to another player that I started forgetting super important details, which just made me crack up even more.  I am not familiar with the source material, but love the artwork.  Big fan of this one.

I don't know what I expected. Witness is exactly what it's described as: a more vicious version of Chinese whispers, where players (fail to) transmit their part of the information they all need to solve a mystery. Sure, the riddles themselves are at least one level above the information shared, so they're not completely dumb. (Got which footprints are whose? Here's a top-down photo of the scene crime. Deduce what has happened.) Unfortunately the cases are at best moderately challenging, with incomplete information passing as the actual difficulty. The whispering still seems like arbitrary concealment of clues based on the group's weakest links' ability at clarity of expression and memory; and cooperative games pointing out a clear unmitigated weakest link to bash on are not a type of design I like much.

On the requirements side, the short playtime and ultra-slim rules are counterbalanced by Witness being a 4 players only game. (Also don't play with trolls, otherwise you might regularly end up asked to pass additional "information" about genitals.)

RATING: 8
This is a really unique and cool game about solving crimes as a team of 4. Note that you need to be exactly 4 players to play this.

The way it works is that people whisper clues to each other and then try to solve the crime using all the clues they heard from other players. This is made more difficult because of the fact that some of the clues have passed through several player's ears before they get to you, it's like a game of telephone.

This game has a limited playtime because each case can only be played once. If any of the players have played the case before it kinda ruins the mechanics. It's important that nobody has seen the solution to the puzzle before.

A game or an activity? Either way Witness an enjoyable time. Witness is an exactly 4 player game, no more, no less. The players are trying to figure out a mystery and collective attempt to gain the most accuracy points. Each player is given a clue in which they must share it with there neighbor, then the neighbor shares there clue plus yours with his neighbor. At the end can you recall all the information you gathered and deduct the answers to the mystery. With over 60 mysteries, it will be some time before the game is "completed."

They packaged 64 logic/memory/visual/etc puzzles in a box, all meant to be solved in a collective manner, and called it a board game. Turns out, it's fun and more challenging than it appeared at first. An impressive amount of care was put into the design. But I hesitate to call it a board game; it's more of a puzzle activity to be enjoyed with 3 other folks.

One simple idea, executed brilliantly... and hysterically.

The difference between this game and Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective is where/how the goofs happen.  In Sherlock, I feel dumb because the clue was right there, one hop away, and I couldn't make the connection.  In Witness, I feel silly because I accidentally confused the three people with impossible-to-remember names.  The tension holds in a different -- and I say better -- way.

If you need a fun 20 to 30 minute filler game with excellent deduction for exactly 4 players and practically no rules at all, this is your game!

Each player has a clue booklet. A story is read and each player must refer to their booklet as to what clue they are about to reveal to another player.

One player 1 will whisper their clue to their neighbor player 2, while another player 3 whispers their clue to player 4. Then the players that heard the clues will whisper their clue, plus the one they heard from the previous round. And there is another round of this transfer of information.

All of this information you need to memorize and it can be very tricky. Certain details might have accidentally been left out or you might have a particularly cheeky player that likes to embelish his clue with somewhat of a story (only creating more to remember for their listener).

Finally, a moment is given to the players to write down their clues and then 3 questions will be asked. Points are tallied as a team and you get one point per correctly answered question.

Gosh darn, I love this game! Remember those third grade logic problems about Halloween costumes or "who ate all the cookies?" Well, they made a cooperative, 4 player game with a noir theme! Each player has a piece of the puzzle and the only to share the info is by whispering everything you know to your neighbor. The trick of the game is perfect communication: how do I condense the information I have to my neighbor so they understand! I didn't expect much of the game because it looked, sorry to say, a little cheap and pulpy. But I believe that's part of the aesthetic. And I was so wrong: Witness is amazing and utilizes a very different mechanic of Telephone for a cooperative, deductive game.

Witness is a bit of a strange beast.  Players each have one piece of information, which they verbally repeat to the next player down the line.  Then they have two pieces of information, which they repeat to the next player, and so on.  I guess it's supposed to be like Telephone, but I didn't have any trouble repeating the information verbatim.  After that, players are asked a series of questions at the end, which tested not only the player's memorization and repetition skills, but also the game's slightly odd logic.  I found the logic part to be by far the hardest part of the game, which was perplexing since it occupies such a small part of it.  In any case, I didn't really find the entire exercise to be fun.

RATING: 8
After eight years in this hobby, I’ve played so many variations on a theme that anything I can describe as ‘unique’ makes me sit up and pay attention. That’s why Witness takes the prize this month. The executive summary is co-operative puzzle-solving via the medium of Chinese whispers. Each of the 64 cases takes around 10 minutes, with initial information being presented to all players before each reads their own piece of personal information. Over four rounds of whispering to the other players, the team attempts to ensure that everyone has all the information they need to (individually) answer three questions posed about the case. 

There are caveats to my recommendation. You need exactly four players, all with good short-term memory and a love of logic puzzles; if one player consistently lets the side down, it can be frustrating (both for them and for the others). And after completing around a third of the cases (in not much over a week!), I’d like to have seen a bit more variety; most are variations on the standard matrix logic puzzle. But returning to my original point, I haven’t played anything like it before, and right now that’s my main motivation for trying yet another new game.

RATING: 5
A unique cooperative puzzle game, but can easily be frustrating and unenjoyable. Even with some of the easier puzzles, it can be very difficult to keep all four clues in your head during the whispering phase of the game. I didn't particularly enjoy the difficulty of remembering which of the very similarly-named characters did what and when. Whispering in someone's ear is also a fairly intimate thing to do, and felt kind of awkward. If you get all the clues perfectly transmitted to you, the final puzzle can range from trivial to still pretty difficult. I found it very frustrating to work through a puzzle for a few minutes and feel confident in my answer, only to discover that one of the clues I had was wrong or garbled. Overall, it's a novel game and I'm glad to have tried it, but it's more interesting than enjoyable.

This clever little game combines a bit of Sherlock Holmes and a bit of Telephone into a silly fifteen minutes of bafflement. 
Each player gets a small clue to an overall puzzle, and must whisper it in their neighbor's ear.  This happens four times, by which point - hypothetically - each player will have heard a complete report of everyone's combined information.
However this will never be the case as inevitably crucial details will be forgotten or misinterpreted, and each player's answer to the overall mystery will be hilariously absurd.

I am having trouble recollecting much enjoyment of my experience playing this game. That is not a good sign. Players were frantically whispering somewhat incomprehensible clues to each other, each originally starting with pieces of information that no one else knew. As a collective, you are tasked to paint the complete picture of a crime scene, and describe potential perpetrators, causes or instruments of the crime, and outcomes. It was kind of hard, and not particularly fun. Interesting, different, but but not fun. I have only played the first case, however, so I am holding out hope for better experiences as I work through them. 

(+) Novel concept of providing players limited information to piece together a puzzle 
(+) Provides some variability through multiple cases to solve 
(+) Fleeting moments of amusement as players become progressively more bewildered as they become more informed. 
 
(-) One and done type campaign style system 
(-) Difficult to really glean much information because of how convoluted clues can be come. 
(-) More of an activity than a game.

A terribly inefficient method of solving crimes, but a fantastic cerebral filler when you have exactly four people. Witness is at its peak when the cases contain potential red herrings or peculiar details which keep teams on their toes. Nothing beats having the rug pulled from under your collective feet when your team realises that a weird smudge in the clues was crucial to the case all along. 

However, a number of cases are straightforward and revolve around memorising a series of logical statements. It’s quite disappointing to encounter this sort of cases in the upper levels because they just require increasingly elaborate mnemonics. Also, the English translation contains a few vaguely-worded clues and typos which will affect the outcome of a case. (In particular, look out for cases #53 and #54.)

Uneven case qualities aside, this is a very unique title for the collection. Obviously the memory and simple puzzle-solving elements will not go down well with many, but I've been fortunate so far to have had several accomplices (willing or otherwise) to help me complete a quarter of the cases.

RATING: 7
This is an interesting and quick cooperative deduction game.  It always feels like a very cerebral party game.

The game is played by exactly four players.  Each player takes the role of a character from the Belgian comic series Blake and Mortimer (of which I'm not familiar).  At the start of the game you read the details of a case (which have 4 different difficulty levels) aloud and each player to themselves reads their own clues.  Then the game lasts four rounds where players will take turns whispering their clues to other players as well as any clues they heard previously for each round after the first.  So the game is cooperative mystery solving with a splash of "telephone".  After those four rounds 3 questions are asked dealing with the case and the solution is read to see how many each player got right.

Some of the clues are long, complex, or require you to actually describe a picture so it is harder than it may seem.  The first case we did (and I will avoid any spoilers) came down to just matching one piece of information with another when it came to the final questions.  However, the second case actually involved not just matching information but using it to infer and deduce other pieces of information.  We missed several answers in both games and those were just the easiest difficulty levels so the game provides plenty of a challenge.

The whole thing takes 15-20 minutes and is incredibly easy to explain to people so this is a good game that appeals to a wide range of gamer types.

RATING: 8
Extremely clever game based on Chinese Whispers/Telephone for exactly 4 players. There are 64 cases, each of which includes a mission briefing, one piece of information for each player, and three questions to be asked at the end. Players pass their information to each other in specified interactions, e.g. player 1 listening first to the information from the player to their left, then passing both bits of information to the one on their right, then going back to the left for more. Each player listens to one other and speaks to one other, so some information is heard third-hand.

I've played 6 of the cases at various different difficulty levels and the quality varies. Generally (but not always) they require memorizing the components of a logic puzzle, e.g. one includes five Yakuza each with a different occupation and a different missing finger; the better ones disguise this with other puzzles.

What's hard and occasionally frustrating is that a single weak link can break the puzzle for everyone - a missing word, transposed symbols and so on. In theory there's a scoring system where each player independently answers the questions and the score out of 12 determines how well the team has done, but our experience has been that errors are more likely to occur in the communication than the solving, which can leave no-one with correct answers.

Just delightful.

I think this was badly demoed at Essen (and the rulebook doesn't help). The first scenario and rulebook show basically no game and all the players are doing is playing Chinese Whispers/Broken Telephone (delete as culturally understood). If this is the only scenario that people played, this could easily be rated a 1 as it isn't a game.

We persevered though and played a more difficult scenario (though not the hardest).

This scenario had much more going on with information changing meaning as time went on and more information was uncovered. The later scenarios seemed quite interesting, but unfortunately by then our collective interest had already waned from the first play.

I suspect this has slightly more replayability than it first appears as there is a lot of information to recall; more than I'm likely to remember across plays, though the easy scenarios are unplayably easy.

I suspect that if I played it again, on a decent difficulty level, that this rating could easily go up quite a long way.

Update: I think I described this as shit but fun after my 5th play. That seems accurate.

Rating up from 5.9 to 6.5.

RATING: 6
Tentative rating after playing the intro scenario only - could be anything from 5 to 7 really.

It's basically mystery solving by chinese whispers. Four players each know one clue, and they have to communicate this to 1 other player directly and to the other 2 via other players - but you're only allowed to make written notes after all the whispering is done, so the challenge is to both remember the details accurately and communicate them precisely. Then, a picture is shown and you have to "connect the dots" so to speak to solve the mystery using the clues you had and were given. Scoring is co-op so if anyone fails to answer the 3 mystery questions presented at the end, the whole team loses points.

Seemed kinda fun in the right mood with the right crowd, but it remains to be seen how similar and challenging the scenarios really are, or if this is just a one-trick-pony, in which case 64 scenarios is total overkill. The intro scenario at least was quite easy.

Could be fun as a pub/partygame maybe?

Upgraded to a 10. 

This game lives up to every expectation. It's a crazy mismash of broken telephone with crime solving. The inability to record anything makes it a constant source of hilarity. With games only taking 10-15 minutes tops, it's always requested to play again. The only downside is that there are only 64 cases, and it has to be played with 4 players...

Really novel memory and logic game. People with better memories will do better, but it's still fun to see how badly a case gets screwed up. I really like that, after a case is finished and it's time to get quizzed, the questions aren't simply "what do you remember?" You have to actually apply the things you remember to try to figure out specific scenarios. That's why I consider this both a memory and a logic game: you have to remember all of the clues, and then you have to put those clues together in non-obvious ways in order to answer questions.

We have ran into issues with the wording on some of the cases. I think this is due to the translation, the fanciful language, or a combination of both. There was at least one case early on that we had to skip because one of the players couldn't even figure out what their own clue meant, so we had to all take time to just figure it out. The wording was unintentionally confusing, even for a game that is trying to confuse. I've already read online that at least one of the cases isn't solvable because of the poor English translation, but I haven't encountered that yet.

Overall I like the game but it's definitely not for everybody. I have personally already encountered three types of people who hated the game after playing it: people who don't like memory games, people who don't like logic problems, and people who have trouble hearing. You may want to avoid this game if you plan to primarily play with any of those types of people.

Sold.

Very unique experience.  It's a great way to play classic telephone, but that's just the clues.  You still have to figure out what really happened, who killed who, how was it done, etc.  You think you know the clues, then you realize that you forgot an important part or that you still have to deduce things based on the clues.
Really fun game and each mission is different.

This is one of those games I don't think it is fair for me to give a number rating to because for me, it would get a very low score (2 maybe) because my short-term memory is terrible, and if you can't remember what you are told and what you are supposed to tell others, it's no fun at all. On the other hand, if you like memory and deduction, I think you would love this game.

Remembering all the information given to you makes this one tricky but that's the fun of it.  It ends up being pretty hilarious when somebody messes up.  First you need to organize all the information in your head then the questions are revealed and you likely need to do some deduction to figure out the answers.  Very cool game.  I was worried that we'd go through all the content really quickly but we still have a bunch more cases to do.

A game based on memory and communication, and then (in some cases) it segues into logic puzzles and/or trivia.  The cases that don't bring in new logical deductions seem overly straightforward and similar for the most part.

A fairly unique concept, and it does play quite quick, but nothing about me strikes it as something I actively want to play more of.

This is an extremely fun, extremely entertaining experience.  Be aware there is a little memory work, and I know a lot of people dog on memory, but Witness plays in 15 minutes and has lots of laughs. Not to mention, I think the memory element is really well done. If you can get into a game, do it.

I like this game but it just falls flat if people aren't good at problem solving and using clues to figure out what happened. Piecing together the whole picture is incredibly challenging and seems outside the realm of a party game situation which I thought this game was meant to fill. In either case it is a wonderful game and I admit this problem is more me than anything else. Give it a try if you like sleuthing.

This game has two downsides: first, it only playes four, exculsively, secondly at some point I think you would run out of new cases. Nonetheless, the gameplay is VERY fun. I love the memory aspect combined with deduction, plus the training in giving precise information. For me, this is a very cool game, but I like all of the above mentioned. The medium and hard cases are fine, easy is probably too easy, at least it was for the group I played with.

Four player co-op mystery crime deduction game based on the old Belgian comic series Blake and Mortimer. Central element of the game is sharing whispered clues in a similar manner as the grapevine game that we played in elementary school. Finally answering a short test to see how well you retained, shared, and remembered that information at increasing difficulty levels.

Very different to anything else I've played and usually lots of fun. Even if you pass round perfect information (which in itself isn't easy) the questions still require some deduction or leaps of logic to answer correctly, and the game occasionally throws you a curve ball you weren't expecting. It's not for everyone: players with poor short-term memory may feel embarrassed at letting the side down.

Group-dependency makes this one a toss-up as well as the focus requirements can make some groups fail these so miserably.  Neat idea

THIS GAME LOOKS AWESOME!!! I haven't played it yet though. Seems like a sort of complicated box version of a game of telephone... but with a REALLY COOL theme. Witness is set in the world of Blake and Mortimer, a Belgian comic series started in the 1940s by writer/artist Edgar P. Jacobs.

Extremely fun deduction game. 

The memory and telephone elements in the game can be frustrating or annoying to some but i enjoy them. I consider this to be a light game to teach but not a light game to play. It can be a brain burner.

The one problem which may be encountered is if 1 player keeps making mistakes costing the team either points or clues. It's fun when it happens once in one session, but if it keeps coming up then that player will feel frustrated. The team must be on the same level of skill .

Step 1: Multiple broken telephone.
Step 2: Solve the puzzle!

I wish there were more steps, although the steps there are pretty different than the usual board game experience. The puzzles look nifty, and I like the artwork, but ultimately the lack of more "game" to it means this wasn't going to hit the table much.
